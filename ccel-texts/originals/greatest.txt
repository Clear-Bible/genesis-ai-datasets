THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD

   THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
   love, I am become as a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though
   I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all
   knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove
   mountains, and have not LOVE I am nothing. And though I bestow all my
   goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
   have not Love, it profiteth me nothing.

   Love suffereth long, and is kind;

   Love envieth not;

   Love vaunteth not itself is not puffed up,

   Doth not behave itself unseemly,

   Seeketh not her own,

   Is not easily provoked,

   Thinketh no evil;

   Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

   Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
   all things.

   Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail;
   whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge,
   it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But
   when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
   done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
   child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
   childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face
   to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am
   known. And now abideth faith, hope, Love, these three; but the greatest
   of these is Love.--I Cor. xiii.

THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD

   EVERY one has asked himself the great question of antiquity as of the
   modern world: What is the summum bonum--the supreme good? You have life
   before you. Once only you can live it. What is the noblest object of
   desire, the supreme gift to covet?

   We have been accustomed to be told that the greatest thing in the
   religious world is Faith. That great word has been the key-note for
   centuries of the popular religion; and we have easily learned to look
   upon it as the greatest thing in the world. Well, we are wrong. If we
   have been told that, we may miss the mark. I have taken you, in the
   chapter which I have just read, to Christianity at its source; and
   there we have seen, "The greatest of these is love." It is not an
   oversight. Paul was speaking of faith just a moment before. He says,
   "If I have all faith, so that I can remove mountains, and have not
   love, I am nothing. "So far from forgetting, he deliberately contrasts
   them, "Now abideth Faith, Hope, Love," and without a moment's
   hesitation, the decision falls, "The greatest of these is Love."

   And it is not prejudice. A man is apt to recommend to others his own
   strong point. Love was not Paul's strong point. The observing student
   can detect a beautiful tenderness growing and ripening all through his
   character as Paul gets old; but the hand that wrote, "The greatest of
   these is love," when we meet it first, is stained with blood.

   Nor is this letter to the Corinthians peculiar in singling out love as
   the summum bonum. The masterpieces of Christianity are agreed about it.
   Peter says, "Above all things have fervent love among yourselves."
   Above all things. And John goes farther, "God is love." And you
   remember the profound remark which Paul makes elsewhere, "Love is the
   fulfilling of the law." Did you ever think what he meant by that? In
   those days men were working their passage to Heaven by keeping the Ten
   Commandments, and the hundred and ten other commandments which they had
   manufactured out of them. Christ said, I will show you a more simple
   way. If you do one thing, you will do these hundred and ten things,
   without ever thinking about them. If you love, you will unconsciously
   fulfil the whole law. And you can readily see for yourselves how that
   must be so. Take any of the commandments. "Thou shalt have no other
   gods before Me." If a man love God, you will not require to tell him
   that. Love is the fulfilling of that law. "Take not His name in vain."
   Would he ever dream of taking His name in vain if he loved Him?
   "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Would he not be too glad to
   have one day in seven to dedicate more exclusively to the object of his
   affection? Love would fulfil all these laws regarding God. And so, if
   he loved Man, you would never think of telling him to honour his father
   and mother. He could not do anything else. It would be preposterous to
   tell him not to kill. You could only insult him if you suggested that
   he should not steal -.how could he steal from those he loved? It would
   be superfluous to beg him not to bear false witness against his
   neighbour. If he loved him it would be the last thing he would do. And
   you would never dream of urging him not to covet what his neighbours
   had. He would rather they possessed it than himself. In this way "Love
   is the fulfilling of the law." It is the rule for fulfilling all rules,
   the new commandment for keeping all the old commandments, Christ's one
   secret of the Christian life.

   Now Paul had learned that; and in this noble eulogy he has given us the
   most wonderful and original account extant of the summum bonum. We may
   divide it into three parts. In the beginning of the short chapter, we
   have Love contrasted; in the heart of it, we have Love analysed;
   towards the end we have Love defended as the supreme gift.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE CONTRAST

   PAUL begins by contrasting Love with other things that men in those
   days thought much of. I shall not attempt to go over those things in
   detail. Their inferiority is already obvious.

   He contrasts it with eloquence. And what a noble gift it is, the power
   of playing upon the souls and wills of men, and rousing them to lofty
   purposes and holy deeds. Paul says, "If I speak with the tongues of men
   and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a
   tinkling cymbal." And we all know why. We have all felt the brazenness
   of words without emotion, the hollowness, the unaccountable
   unpersuasiveness, of eloquence behind which lies no Love.

   He contrasts it with prophecy. He contrasts it with mysteries. He
   contrasts it with faith. He contrasts it with charity. Why is Love
   greater than faith? Because the end is greater than the means. And why
   is it greater than charity? Because the whole is greater than the part.
   Love is greater than faith, because the end is greater than the means.
   What is the use of having faith? It is to connect the soul with God.
   And what is the object of connecting man with God? That he may become
   like God. But God is Love. Hence Faith, the means, is in order to Love,
   the end. Love, therefore, obviously is greater than faith. It is
   greater than charity, again, because the whole is greater than a part.
   Charity is only a little bit of Love, one of the innumerable avenues of
   Love, and there may even be, and there is, a great deal of charity
   without Love. It is a very easy thing to toss a copper to a beggar on
   the street; it is generally an easier thing than not to do it. Yet Love
   is just as often in the withholding. We purchase relief from the
   sympathetic feelings roused by the spectacle of misery, at the copper's
   cost. It is too cheap--too cheap for us, and often too dear for the
   beggar. If we really loved him we would either do more for him, or
   less.

   Then Paul contrasts it with sacrifice and martyrdom. And I beg the
   little band of would-be missionaries and I have the honour to call some
   of you by this name for the first time--to remember that though you
   give your bodies to be burned, and have not Love, it profits
   nothing--nothing! You can take nothing greater to the heathen world
   than the impress and reflection of the Love of God upon your own
   character. That is the universal language. It will take you years to
   speak in Chinese, or in the dialects of India. From the day you land,
   that language of Love, understood by all, will be pouring forth its
   unconscious eloquence. It is the man who is the missionary, it is not
   his words. His character is his message. In the heart of Africa, among
   the great Lakes, I have come across black men and women who remembered
   the only white man they ever saw before--David Livingstone; and as you
   cross his footsteps in that dark continent, men's faces light up as
   they speak of the kind Doctor who passed there years ago. They could
   not understand him; but they felt the Love that beat in his heart. Take
   into your new sphere of labour, where you also mean to lay down your
   life, that simple charm, and your lifework must succeed. You can take
   nothing greater, you need take nothing less. It is-not worth while
   going if you take anything less. You may take every accomplishment; you
   may be braced for every sacrifice; but if you give your body to be
   burned, and have not Love, it will profit you and the cause of Christ
   nothing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE ANALYSIS

   AFTER contrasting Love with these things, Paul, in three verses, very
   short, gives us an amazing analysis of what this supreme thing is. I
   ask you to look at it. It is a compound thing, he tells us. It is like
   light. As you have seen a man of science take a beam of light and pass
   it through a crystal prism, as you have seen it come out on the other
   side of the prism broken up into its component colours--red, and blue,
   and yellow, and violet, and orange, and all the colours of the
   rainbow--so Paul passes this thing, Love, through the magnificent prism
   of his inspired intellect, and it comes out on the other side broken up
   into its elements. And in these few words we have what one might call
   the Spectrum of Love, the analysis of Love. Will you observe what its
   elements are? Will you notice that they have common names; that they
   are virtues which we hear about every day; that they are things which
   can be practised by every man in every place in life; and how, by a
   multitude of small things and ordinary virtues, the supreme thing, the
   summum bonum, is made up?

   The Spectrum of Love has nine ingredients:--

   Patience . . . . . .             "Love suffereth long."

   Kindness . . . . . .            "And is kind."

   Generosity  . . . .            "Love envieth not."

   Humility . . . . . .            "Love vaunteth not itself, is not
   puffed up."

   Courtesy . . . . . .            "Doth not behave itself unseemly."

   Unselfishness . .             "Seeketh not her own."

   Good Temper . .             "Is not easily provoked."

   Guilelessness . .             "Thinketh no evil."

   Sincerity . . . . . .            "Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but
   rejoiceth in the truth."

   Patience; kindness; generosity; humility; courtesy; unselfishness; good
   temper; guilelessness; sincerity--these make up the supreme gift, the
   stature of the perfect man. You will observe that all are in relation
   to men, in relation to life, in relation to the known to-day and the
   near to-morrow, and not to the unknown eternity. We hear much of love
   to God; Christ spoke much of love to man. We make a great deal of peace
   with heaven; Christ made much of peace on earth. Religion is not a
   strange or added thing, but the inspiration of the secular life, the
   breathing of an eternal spirit through this temporal world. The supreme
   thing, in short, is not a thing at all, but the giving of a further
   finish to the multitudinous words and acts which make up the sum of
   every common day.

   There is no time to do more than make a passing note upon each of these
   ingredients. Love is Patience. This is the normal attitude of Love;
   Love passive, Love waiting to begin; not in a hurry; calm; ready to do
   its work when the summons comes, but meantime wearing the ornament of a
   meek and quiet spirit. Love suffers long; beareth all things; believeth
   all things; hopeth all things. For Love understands, and therefore
   waits.

   Kindness. Love active. Have you ever noticed how much of Christ's life
   was spent in doing kind things--in merely doing kind things? Run over
   it with that in view and you will find that He spent a great proportion
   of His time simply in making people happy, in doing good turns to
   people. There is only one thing greater than happiness in the world,
   and that is holiness; and it is not in our keeping; but what God has
   put in our power is the happiness of those about us, and that is
   largely to be secured by our being kind to them.

   "The greatest thing," says some one, "a man can do for his Heavenly
   Father is to be kind to some of His other children." I wonder why it is
   that we are not all kinder than we are? How much the world needs it.
   How easily it is done. How instantaneously it acts. How infallibly it
   is remembered. How superabundantly it pays itself back--for there is no
   debtor in the world so honourable, so superbly honourable, as Love.
   "Love never faileth".  Love is success, Love is happiness, Love is
   life. "Love, I say, "with Browning, "is energy of Life."


   "For life, with all it yields of joy and woe

   And hope and fear,

   Is just our chance o' the prize of learning love--

   How love might be, hath been indeed, and is."

   Where Love is, God is. He that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God. God is
   love. Therefore love. Without distinction, without calculation, without
   procrastination, love. Lavish it upon the poor, where it is very easy;
   especially upon the rich, who often need it most; most of all upon our
   equals, where it is very difficult, and for whom perhaps we each do
   least of all. There is a difference between trying to please and giving
   pleasure Give pleasure. Lose no chance of giving pleasure. For that is
   the ceaseless and anonymous triumph of a truly loving spirit.

   "I shall pass through this world but once. Any good thing therefore
   that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let
   me do it now. Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass
   this way again."

   Generosity. "Love envieth not" This is Love in competition with others.
   Whenever you attempt a good work you will find other men doing the same
   kind of work, and probably doing it better. Envy them not. Envy is a
   feeling of ill-will to those who are in the same line as ourselves, a
   spirit of covetousness and detraction. How little Christian work even
   is a protection against un-Christian feeling. That most despicable of
   all the unworthy moods which cloud a Christian's soul assuredly waits
   for us on the threshold of every work, unless we are fortified with
   this grace of magnanimity. Only one thing truly need the Christian
   envy, the large, rich, generous soul which "envieth not."

   And then, after having learned all that, you have to learn this further
   thing, Humility-- to put a seal upon your lips and forget what you have
   done. After you have been kind, after Love has stolen forth into the
   world and done its beautiful work, go back into the shade again and say
   nothing about it Love hides even from itself. Love waives even
   self-satisfaction. "Love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up."

   The fifth ingredient is a somewhat strange one to find in this summum
   bonum: Courtesy. This is Love in society, Love in relation to
   etiquette. "Love doth not behave itself unseemly." Politeness has been
   defined as love in trifles. Courtesy is said to be love in little
   things. And the one secret of politeness is to love. Love cannot behave
   itself unseemly. You can put the most untutored person into the highest
   society, and if they have a reservoir of love in their heart, they will
   not behave themselves unseemly. They simply cannot do it. Carlyle said
   of Robert Burns that there was no truer gentleman in Europe than the
   ploughman-poet. It was because he loved everything--the mouse, and the
   daisy, and all the things, great and small, that God had made. So with
   this simple passport he could mingle with any society, and enter courts
   and palaces from his little cottage on the banks of the Ayr. You know
   the meaning of the word "gentleman." It means a gentle man--a man who
   does things gently, with love. And that is the whole art and mystery of
   it. The gentleman cannot in the nature of things do an ungentle, an
   ungentlemanly thing. The un-gentle soul, the inconsiderate,
   unsympathetic nature cannot do anything else. "Love doth not behave
   itself unseemly."

   Unselfishness. "Love seeketh not her own." Observe: Seeketh not even
   that which is her own. In Britain the Englishman is devoted, and
   rightly, to his rights. But there come times when a man may exercise
   even the higher right of giving up his rights. Yet Paul does not summon
   us to give up our rights. Love strikes much deeper. It would have us
   not seek them at all, ignore them, eliminate the personal element
   altogether from our calculations. It is not hard to give up our rights.
   They are often external. The difficult thing is to give up ourselves.
   The more difficult thing still is not to seek things for ourselves at
   all. After we have sought them, bought them, won them, deserved them,
   we have taken the cream off them for ourselves already. Little cross
   then, perhaps, to give them up. But not to seek them, to look every man
   not on his own things, but on the things of others--id opus est.
   "Seekest thou great things for thyself? "said the prophet; "seek them
   not." Why? Because there is no greatness in things. Things cannot be
   great. The only greatness is unselfish love. Even self-denial in itself
   is nothing, is almost a mistake. Only a great purpose or a mightier
   love can justify the waste. It is more difficult, I have said, not to
   seek our own at all, than, having sought it, to give it up. I must take
   that back. It is only true of a partly selfish heart. Nothing is a
   hardship to Love, and nothing is hard. I believe that Christ's yoke is
   easy. Christ's "yoke" is just His way of taking life. And I believe it
   is an easier way than any other. I believe it is a happier way than any
   other. The most obvious lesson in Christ's teaching is that there is no
   happiness in having and getting anything, but only in giving. I repeat,
   there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. And
   half the world is on the wrong scent in the pursuit of happiness. They
   think it consists in having and getting, and in being served by others.
   It consists in giving, and in serving others. He that would be great
   among you, said Christ, let him serve. He that would be happy, let him
   remember that there is but one way--it is more blessed, it is more
   happy, to give than to receive.

   The next ingredient is a very remarkable one: Good Temper. "Love is not
   easily provoked." Nothing could be more striking than to find this
   here. We are inclined to look upon bad temper as a very harmless
   weakness. We speak of it as a mere infirmity of nature, a family
   failing, a matter of temperament, not a thing to take into very serious
   account in estimating a man's character. And yet here, right in the
   heart of this analysis of love, it finds a place; and the Bible again
   and again returns to condemn it as one of the most destructive elements
   in human nature.

   The peculiarity of ill temper is that it is the vice of the virtuous.
   It is often the one blot on an otherwise noble character. You know men
   who are all but perfect, and women who would be entirely perfect, but
   for an easily ruffled, quick-tempered, or "touchy" disposition. This
   compatibility of ill temper with high moral character is one of the
   strangest and saddest problems of ethics. The truth is there are two
   great classes of sins--sins of the Body, and sins of the Disposition.
   The Prodigal Son may be taken as a type of the first, the Elder Brother
   of the second. Now society has no doubt whatever as to which of these
   is the worse. Its brand falls, without a challenge, upon the Prodigal.
   But are we right? We have no balance to weigh one another's sins, and
   coarser and finer are but human words; but faults in the higher nature
   may be less venial than those in the lower, and to the eye of Him who
   is Love, a sin against Love may seem a hundred times more base. No form
   of vice, not worldliness, not greed of gold, not drunkenness itself,
   does more to un-Christianise society than evil temper. For embittering
   life, for breaking up communities, for destroying the most sacred
   relationships, for devastating homes, for withering up men and women,
   for taking the bloom off childhood; in short, for sheer gratuitous
   misery-producing power, this influence stands alone. Look at the Elder
   Brother, moral, hard-working, patient, dutiful--let him get all credit
   for his virtues--look at this man, this baby, sulking outside his own
   father's door. "He was angry," we read, "and would not go in." Look at
   the effect upon the father, upon the servants, upon the happiness of
   the guests. Judge of the effect upon the Prodigal--and how many
   prodigals are kept out of the Kingdom of God by the unlovely characters
   of those who profess to be inside? Analyse, as a study in Temper, the
   thunder-cloud itself as it gathers upon the Elder Brother's brow. What
   is it made of? Jealousy, anger, pride, uncharity, cruelty,
   self-righteousness, touchiness, doggedness, sullenness--these are the
   ingredients of this dark and loveless soul. In varying proportions,
   also, these are the ingredients of all ill temper. Judge if such sins
   of the disposition are not worse to live in, and for others to live
   with, than sins of the body. Did Christ indeed not answer the question
   Himself when He said, "I say unto you, that the publicans and the
   harlots go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you." There is really no
   place in Heaven for a disposition like this. A man with such a mood
   could only make Heaven miserable for all the people in it. Except,
   therefore, such a man be born again, he cannot, he simply cannot, enter
   the Kingdom of Heaven. For it is perfectly certain-- and you will not
   misunderstand me--that to enter Heaven a man must take it with him.

   You will see then why Temper is significant. It is not in what it is
   alone, but in what it reveals. This is why I take the liberty now of
   speaking of it with such unusual plainness. It is a test for love, a
   symptom, a revelation of an unloving nature at bottom. It is the
   intermittent fever which bespeaks unintermittent disease within; the
   occasional bubble escaping to the surface which betrays some rottenness
   underneath; a sample of the most hidden products of the soul dropped
   involuntarily when off one's guard; in a word, the lightning form of a
   hundred hideous and un-Christian sins. For a want of patience, a want
   of kindness, a want of generosity, a want of courtesy, a want of
   unselfishness, are all instantaneously symbolised in one flash of
   Temper.

   Hence it is not enough to deal with the temper. We must go to the
   source, and change the inmost nature, and the angry humours will die
   away of themselves. Souls are made sweet not by taking the acid fluids
   out, but by putting something in--a great Love, a new Spirit, the
   Spirit of Christ. Christ, the Spirit of Christ, interpenetrating ours,
   sweetens, purifies, transforms all. This only can eradicate what is
   wrong, work a chemical change, renovate and regenerate, and
   rehabilitate the inner man. Will-power does not change men. Time does
   not change men. Christ does. Therefore "Let that mind be in you which
   was also in Christ Jesus." Some of us have not much time to lose.
   Remember, once more, that this is a matter of life or death. I cannot
   help speaking urgently, for myself, for yourselves. "Whoso shall offend
   one of these little ones, which believe in me, it were better for him
   that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned
   in the depth of the sea." That is to say, it is the deliberate verdict
   of the Lord Jesus that it is better not to live than not to love. It is
   better not to live than not to love.

   Guilelessness and Sincerity may be dismissed almost with a word.
   Guilelessness is the grace for suspicious people. And the possession of
   it is the great secret of personal influence. You will find, if you
   think for a moment, that the people who influence you are people who
   believe in you. In an atmosphere of suspicion men shrivel up; but in
   that atmosphere they expand, and find encouragement and educative
   fellowship. It is a wonderful thing that here and there in this hard,
   uncharitable world there should still be left a few rare souls who
   think no evil. This is the great unworldliness. Love "thinketh no
   evil," imputes no motive, sees the bright side, puts the best
   construction on every action. What a delightful state of mind to live
   in! What a stimulus and benediction even to meet with it for a day! To
   be trusted is to be saved. And if we try to influence or elevate
   others, we shall soon see that success is in proportion to their belief
   of our belief in them. For the respect of another is the first
   restoration of the self-respect a man has lost; our ideal of what he is
   becomes to him the hope and pattern of what he may become.

   "Love rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth." I have
   called this Sincerity from the words rendered in the Authorised Version
   by "rejoiceth in the truth." And, certainly, were this the real
   translation, nothing could be more just. For he who loves will love
   Truth not less than men. He will rejoice in the Truth--rejoice not in
   what he has been taught to believe; not in this Church's doctrine or in
   that; not in this ism or in that ism; but "in the Truth." He will
   accept only what is real; he will strive to get at facts; he will
   search for Truth with a humble and unbiased mind, and cherish whatever
   he finds at any sacrifice. But the more literal translation of the
   Revised Version calls for just such a sacrifice for truth's sake here.
   For what Paul really meant is, as we there read, "Rejoiceth not in
   unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth," a quality which
   probably no one English word--and certainly not Sincerity--adequately
   defines. It includes, perhaps more strictly, the self-restraint which
   refuses to make capital out of others' faults; the charity which
   delights not in exposing the weakness of others, but "covereth all
   things"; the sincerity of purpose which endeavours to see things as
   they are, and rejoices to find them better than suspicion feared or
   calumny denounced.

   So much for the analysis of Love. Now the business of our lives is to
   have these things fitted into our characters. That is the supreme work
   to which we need to address ourselves in this world, to learn Love. Is
   life not full of opportunities for learning Love? Every man and woman
   every day has a thousand of them. The world is not a play-ground; it is
   a schoolroom. Life is not a holiday, but an education. And the one
   eternal lesson for us all is how better we can love What makes a man a
   good cricketer? Practice. What makes a man a good artist, a good
   sculptor, a good musician? Practice. What makes a man a good linguist,
   a good stenographer? Practice. What makes a man a good man? Practice.
   Nothing else. There is nothing capricious about religion. We do not get
   the soul in different ways, under different laws, from those in which
   we get the body and the mind. If a man does not exercise his arm he
   develops no biceps muscle; and if a man does not exercise his soul, he
   acquires no muscle in his soul, no strength of character, no vigour of
   moral fibre, nor beauty of spiritual growth. Love is not a thing of
   enthusiastic emotion. It is a rich, strong, manly, vigorous expression
   of the whole round Christian character--the Christlike nature in its
   fullest development. And the constituents of this great character are
   only to be built up by ceaseless practice.

   What was Christ doing in the carpenter's shop? Practising. Though
   perfect, we read that He learned obedience, He increased in wisdom and
   in favour with God and man. Do not quarrel therefore with your lot in
   life. Do not complain of its never-ceasing cares, its petty
   environment, the vexations you have to stand, the small and sordid
   souls you have to live and work with. Above all, do not resent
   temptation; do not be perplexed because it seems to thicken round you
   more and more, and ceases neither for effort nor for agony nor prayer.
   That is the practice which God appoints you; and it is having its work
   in making you patient, and humble, and generous, and unselfish, and
   kind, and courteous. Do not grudge the hand that is moulding the still
   too shapeless image within you. It is growing more beautiful though you
   see it not, and every touch of temptation may add to its perfection.
   Therefore keep in the midst of life. Do not isolate yourself. Be among
   men, and among things, and among troubles, and difficulties, and
   obstacles. You remember Goethe's words: Es bildet ein Talent sich in
   der Stille, Doch ein Character in dem Strom der Welt. "Talent develops
   itself in solitude; character in the stream of life." Talent develops
   itself in solitude--the talent of prayer, of faith, of meditation, of
   seeing the unseen; Character grows in the stream of the world's life.
   That chiefly is where men are to learn love.

   How? Now, how? To make it easier, I have named a few of the elements of
   love. But these are only elements. Love itself can never be defined.
   Light is a something more than the sum of its ingredients--a glowing,
   dazzling, tremulous ether. And love is something more than all its
   elements-- a palpitating, quivering, sensitive, living thing. By
   synthesis of all the colours, men can make whiteness, they cannot make
   light. By synthesis of all the virtues, men can make virtue, they
   cannot make love. How then are we to have this transcendent living
   whole conveyed into our souls? We brace our wills to secure it. We try
   to copy those who have it. We lay down rules about it. We watch. We
   pray. But these things alone will not bring Love into our nature. Love
   is an effect. And only as we fulfil the right condition can we have the
   effect produced. Shall I tell you what the cause is?

   If you turn to the Revised Version of the First Epistle of John you
   will find these words: "We love, because He first loved us."  "We
   love," not "We love Him" That is the way the old Version has it, and it
   is quite wrong. "We love--because He first loved us." Look at that word
   "because." It is the cause of which I have spoken. "Because He first
   loved us," the effect follows that we love, we love Him, we love all
   men. We cannot help it. Because He loved us, we love, we love
   everybody. Our heart is slowly changed. Contemplate the love of Christ,
   and you will love. Stand before that mirror, reflect Christ's
   character, and you will be changed into the same image from tenderness
   to tenderness. There is no other way. You cannot love to order. You can
   only look at the lovely object, and fall in love with it, and grow into
   likeness to it And so look at this Perfect Character, this Perfect
   Life. Look at the great Sacrifice as He laid down Himself, all through
   life, and upon the Cross of Calvary; and you must love Him. And loving
   Him, you must become like Him. Love begets love. It is a process of
   induction. Put a piece of iron in the presence of a magnetised body,
   and that piece of iron for a time becomes magnetised. It is charged
   with an attractive force in the mere presence of the original force,
   and as long as you leave the two side by side, they are both magnets
   alike. Remain side by side with Him who loved us, and gave Himself for
   us, and you too will become a centre of power, a permanently attractive
   force; and like Him you will draw all men unto you, like Him you will
   be drawn unto all men. That is the inevitable effect of Love. Any man
   who fulfils that cause must have that effect produced in him. Try to
   give up the idea that religion comes to us by chance, or by mystery, or
   by caprice. It comes to us by natural law, or by supernatural law, for
   all law is Divine. Edward Irving went to see a dying boy once, and when
   he entered the room he just put his hand on the sufferer's head, and
   said, "My boy, God loves you," and went away. And the boy started from
   his bed, and called out to the people in the house, "God loves me! God
   loves me!" It changed that boy. The sense that God loved him
   overpowered him, melted him down, and began the creating of a new heart
   in him. And that is how the love of God melts down the unlovely heart
   in man, and begets in him the new creature, who is patient and humble
   and gentle and unselfish. And there is no other way to get it. There is
   no mystery about it We love others, we love everybody, we love our
   enemies, because He first loved us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE DEFENCE

   Now I have a closing sentence or two to add about Paul's reason for
   singling out love as the supreme possession. It is a very remarkable
   reason. In a single word it is this: it lasts. "Love," urges Paul,
   "never faileth." Then he begins again one of his marvellous lists of
   the great things of the day, and exposes them one by one. He runs over
   the things that men thought were going to last, and shows that they are
   all fleeting, temporary, passing away.

   "Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail" It was the mother's
   ambition for her boy in those days that he should become a prophet. For
   hundreds of years God had never spoken by means of any prophet, and at
   that time the prophet was greater than the king. Men waited wistfully
   for another messenger to come, and hung upon his lips when he appeared
   as upon the very voice of God. Paul says, "Whether there be prophecies,
   they shall fail" This Book is full of prophecies. One by one they have
   "failed"; that is, having been fulfilled their work is finished; they
   have nothing more to do now in the world except to feed a devout man's
   faith.

   Then Paul talks about tongues. That was another thing that was greatly
   coveted. "Whether there be tongues, they shall cease." As we all know,
   many, many centuries have passed since tongues have been known in this
   world. They have ceased. Take it in any sense you like. Take it, for
   illustration merely, as languages in general--a sense which was not in
   Paul's mind at all, and which though it cannot give us the specific
   lesson will point the general truth. Consider the words in which these
   chapters were written--Greek. It has gone. Take the Latin--the other
   great tongue of those days. It ceased long ago. Look at the Indian
   language. It is ceasing. The language of Wales, of Ireland, of the
   Scottish Highlands is dying before our eyes. The most popular book in
   the English tongue at the present time, except the Bible, is one of
   Dickens's works, his Pickwick Papers. It is largely written in the
   language of London streetlife; and experts assure us that in fifty
   years it will be unintelligible to the average English reader.

   Then Paul goes farther, and with even greater boldness adds, "Whether
   there be knowledge, it shall vanish away." The wisdom of the ancients,
   where is it? It is wholly gone. A schoolboy to-day knows more than Sir
   Isaac Newton knew. His knowledge has vanished away. You put yesterday's
   newspaper in the fire. Its knowledge has vanished away. You buy the old
   editions of the great encyclopaedias for a few pence. Their knowledge
   has vanished away. Look how the coach has been superseded by the use of
   steam. Look how electricity has superseded that, and swept a hundred
   almost new inventions into oblivion. One of the greatest living
   authorities, Sir William Thomson, said the other day, "The steam-engine
   is passing away." "Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
   At every workshop you will see, in the back yard, a heap of old iron, a
   few wheels, a few levers, a few cranks, broken and eaten with rust.
   Twenty years ago that was the pride of the city Men flocked in from the
   country to see the great invention; now it is superseded, its day is
   done. And all the boasted science and philosophy of this day will soon
   be old.  But yesterday, in the University of Edinburgh, the greatest
   figure in the faculty was Sir James Simpson, the discoverer of
   chloroform. The other day his successor and nephew, Professor Simpson,
   was asked by the librarian of the University to go to the library and
   pick out the books on his subject that were no longer needed. And his
   reply to the librarian was this: "Take every text-book that is more
   than ten years old, and put it down in the cellar."Sir James Simpson
   was a great authority only a few years ago: men came from all parts of
   the earth to consult him; and almost the whole teaching of that time is
   consigned by the science of to-day to oblivion. And in every branch of
   science it is the same. "Now we know in part. We see through a glass
   darkly."

   Can you tell me anything that is going to last? Many things Paul did
   not condescend to name. He did not mention money, fortune, fame; but he
   picked out the great things of his time, the things the best men
   thought had something in them, and brushed them peremptorily aside.
   Paul had no charge against these things in themselves. All he said
   about them was that they would not last They were great things, but not
   supreme things. There were things beyond them. What we are stretches
   past what we do, beyond what we possess. Many things that men denounce
   as sins are not sins; but they are temporary. And that is a favourite
   argument of the New Testament. John says of the world, not that it is
   wrong, but simply that it "passeth away." There is a great deal in the
   world that is delightful and beautiful; there is a great deal in it
   that is great and engrossing; but it will not last. All that is in the
   world, the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of
   life, are but for a little while. Love not the world therefore. Nothing
   that it contains is worth the life and consecration of an immortal
   soul. The immortal soul must give itself to something that is immortal.
   And the only immortal things are these: "Now abideth faith, hope, love,
   but the greatest of these is love."

   Some think the time may come when two of these three things will also
   pass away --faith into sight, hope into fruition. Paul does not say so.
   We know but little now about the conditions of the life that is to
   come. But what is certain is that Love must last. God, the Eternal God,
   is Love. Covet therefore that everlasting gift, that one thing which it
   is certain is going to stand, that one coinage which will be current in
   the Universe when all the other coinages of all the nations of the
   world shall be useless and unhonoured. You will give yourselves to many
   things, give yourselves first to Love. Hold things in their proportion.
   Hold things in their proportion. Let at least the first great object of
   our lives be to achieve the character defended in these words, the
   character,--and it is the character of Christ--which is built around
   Love.

   I have said this thing is eternal. Did you ever notice how continually
   John associates love and faith with eternal life? I was not told when I
   was a boy that "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should have everlasting life."
   What I was told, I remember, was, that God so loved the world that, if
   I trusted in Him, I was to have a thing called peace, or I was to have
   rest, or I was to have joy, or I was to have safety. But I had to find
   out for myself that whosoever trusteth in Him--that is, whosoever
   loveth Him, for trust is only the avenue to Love--hath everlasting life
   The Gospel offers a man life. Never offer men a thimbleful of Gospel.
   Do not offer them merely joy, or merely peace, or merely rest, or
   merely safety; tell them how Christ came to give men a more abundant
   life than they have, a life abundant in love, and therefore abundant in
   salvation for themselves, and large in enterprise for the alleviation
   and redemption of the world. Then only can the Gospel take hold of the
   whole of a man, body, soul, and spirit, and give to each part of his
   nature its exercise and reward. Many of the current Gospels are
   addressed only to a part of man's nature. They offer peace, not life;
   faith, not Love; justification, not regeneration. And men slip back
   again from such religion because it has never really held them. Their
   nature was not all in it. It offered no deeper and gladder life-current
   than the life that was lived before. Surely it stands to reason that
   only a fuller love can compete with the love of the world.

   To love abundantly is to live abundantly, and to love for ever is to
   live for ever. Hence, eternal life is inextricably bound up with love
   We want to live for ever for the same reason that we want to live
   tomorrow. Why do you want to live tomorrow? It is because there is some
   one who loves you, and whom you want to see tomorrow, and be with, and
   love back. There is no other reason why we should live on than that we
   love and are beloved. It is when a man has no one to love him that he
   commits suicide. So long as he has friends, those who love him and whom
   he loves, he will live; because to live is to love. Be it but the love
   of a dog, it will keep him in life; but let that go and he has no
   contact with life, no reason to live. The "energy of life" has failed.
   Eternal life also is to know God, and God is love. This is Christ's own
   definition. Ponder it. "This is life eternal, that they might know Thee
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." Love must be
   eternal. It is what God is. On the last analysis, then, love is life.
   Love never faileth, and life never faileth, so long as there is love.
   That is the philosophy of what Paul is showing us; the reason why in
   the nature of things Love should be the supreme thing--because it is
   going to last; because in the nature of things it is an Eternal Life.
   That Life is a thing that we are living now, not that we get when we
   die; that we shall have a poor chance of getting when we die unless we
   are living now. No worse fate can befall a man in this world than to
   live and grow old alone, unloving, and unloved. To be lost is to live
   in an unregenerate condition, loveless and unloved; and to be saved is
   to love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth already in God. For God
   is love.

   Now I have all but finished. How many of you will join me in reading
   this chapter once a week for the next three months? A man did that once
   and it changed his whole life. Will you do it? It is for the greatest
   thing in the world. You might begin by reading it every day, especially
   the verses which describe the perfect character. "Love suffereth long,
   and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself." Get these
   ingredients into your life. Then everything that you do is eternal. It
   is worth doing. It is worth giving time to. No man can become a saint
   in his sleep; and to fulfil the condition required demands a certain
   amount of prayer and meditation and time, just as improvement in any
   direction, bodily or mental, requires preparation and care. Address
   yourselves to that one thing; at any cost have this transcendent
   character exchanged for yours. You will find as you look back upon your
   life that the moments that stand out, the moments when you have really
   lived, are the moments when you have done things in a spirit of love.
   As memory scans the past, above and beyond all the transitory pleasures
   of life, there leap forward those supreme hours when you have been
   enabled to do unnoticed kindnesses to those round about you, things too
   trifling to speak about, but which you feel have entered into your
   eternal life. I have seen almost all the beautiful things God has made;
   I have enjoyed almost every pleasure that He has planned for man; and
   yet as I look back I see standing out above all the life that has gone
   four or five short experiences when the love of God reflected itself in
   some poor imitation, some small act of love of mine, and these seem to
   be the things which alone of all one's life abide. Everything else in
   all our lives is transitory. Every other good is visionary. But the
   acts of love which no man knows about, or can ever know about--they
   never fail.

   In the Book of Matthew, where the Judgment Day is depicted for us in
   the imagery of One seated upon a throne and dividing the sheep from the
   goats, the test of a man then is not, "How have I believed?" but "How
   have I loved?" The test of religion, the final test of religion, is not
   religiousness, but Love. I say the final test of religion at that great
   Day is not religiousness, but Love; not what I have done, not what I
   have believed, not what I have achieved, but how I have discharged the
   common charities of life. Sins of commission in that awful indictment
   are not even referred to. By what we have not done, by sins of
   omission, we are judged. It could not be otherwise. For the withholding
   of love is the negation of the spirit of Christ, the proof that we
   never knew Him, that for us He lived in vain. It means that He
   suggested nothing in all our thoughts, that He inspired nothing in all
   our lives, that we were not once near enough to Him to be seized with
   the spell of His compassion for the world. It means that--


   "I lived for myself, I thought for myself,

   For myself, and none beside--

   Just as if Jesus had never lived,

   As if He had never died."

   It is the Son of Man before whom the nations of the world shall be
   gathered. It is in the presence of Humanity that we shall be charged.
   And the spectacle itself, the mere sight of it, will silently judge
   each one. Those will be there whom we have met and helped: or there,
   the unpitied multitude whom we neglected or despised.  No other Witness
   need be summoned. No other charge than lovelessness shall be preferred.
   Be not deceived. The words which all of us shall one Day hear, sound
   not of theology but of life, not of churches and saints but of the
   hungry and the poor, not of creeds and doctrines but of shelter and
   clothing, not of Bibles and prayer-books but of cups of cold water in
   the name of Christ. Thank God the Christianity of to-day is coming
   nearer the world's need. Live to help that on. Thank God men know
   better, by a hairsbreadth, what religion is, what God is, who Christ
   is, where Christ is. Who is Christ? He who fed the hungry, clothed the
   naked, visited the sick. And where is Christ? Where?--whoso shall
   receive a little child in My name receiveth Me. And who are Christ's?
   Every one that loveth is born of God.

     __________________________________________________________________

  THE PROGRAMME OF CHRISTIANITY

   "WHAT does God do all day?" once asked a little boy. One could wish
   that more grown-up people would ask so very real a question.
   Unfortunately, most of us are not even boys in religious intelligence,
   but only very unthinking children. It no more occurs to us that God is
   engaged in any particular work in the world than it occurs to a little
   child that its father does anything except be its father. Its father
   may be a Cabinet Minister absorbed in the nation's work, or an inventor
   deep in schemes for the world's good; but to this master-egoist he is
   father, and nothing more. Childhood, whether in the physical or moral
   world, is the great self-centred period of life; and a personal God who
   satisfies personal ends is all that for a long time many a Christian
   understands.

   But as clearly as there comes to the growing child a knowledge of its
   father's part in the world, and a sense of what real life means, there
   must come to every Christian whose growth is true some richer sense of
   the meaning of Christianity and a larger view of Christ's purpose for
   mankind. To miss this is to miss the whole splendour and glory of
   Christ's religion. Next to losing the sense of a personal Christ, the
   worst evil that can befall a Christian is to have no sense of anything
   else. To grow up in complacent belief that God has no business in this
   great groaning world of human beings except to attend to a few saved
   souls is the negation of all religion. The first great epoch in a
   Christian's life, after the awe and wonder of its dawn, is when there
   breaks into his mind some sense that Christ has a purpose for mankind,
   a purpose beyond him and his needs, beyond the churches and their
   creeds, beyond Heaven and its saints--a purpose which embraces every
   man and woman born, every kindred and nation formed, which regards not
   their spiritual good alone but their welfare in every part, their
   progress, their health, their work, their wages, their happiness in
   this present world.

   What, then, does Christ do all day? By what further conception shall we
   augment the selfish view of why Christ lived and died?

   I shall mislead no one, I hope, if I say --for I wish to put the social
   side of Christianity in its strongest light--that Christ did not come
   into the world to give men religion. He never mentioned the word
   religion. Religion was in the world before Christ came, and it lives
   to-day in a million souls who have never heard His name. What God does
   all day  is not to sit waiting in churches for people to come and
   worship Him. It is true that God is in churches and in all kinds of
   churches, and is found by many in churches more immediately than
   anywhere else. It is also true that while Christ did not give men
   religion He gave a new direction to the religious aspiration bursting
   forth then and now and always from the whole world's heart. But it was
   His purpose to enlist these aspirations on behalf of some definite
   practical good. The religious people of those days did nothing with
   their religion except attend to its observances. Even the priest, after
   he had been to the temple, thought his work was done; when he met the
   wounded man he passed by on the other side. Christ reversed all
   this--tried to reverse it, for He is only now beginning to succeed. The
   tendency of the religions of all time has been to care more for
   religion than for humanity; Christ cared more for humanity than for
   religion--rather His care for humanity was the chief expression of His
   religion. He was not indifferent to observances, but the practices of
   the people bulked in His thoughts before the practices of the Church.
   It has been pointed out as a blemish on the immortal allegory of Bunyan
   that the Pilgrim never did anything, anything but save his soul. The
   remark is scarcely fair, for the allegory is designedly the story of a
   soul in a single relation; and besides, he did do a little. But the
   warning may well be weighed. The Pilgrim's one thought, his work by
   day, his dream by night, was escape. He took little part in the world
   through which he passed. He was a Pilgrim travelling through it; his
   business was to get through safe. Whatever this is, it is not
   Christianity. Christ's conception of Christianity was heavens removed
   from that of a man setting out from the City of Destruction to save his
   soul. It was rather that of a man dwelling amidst the Destructions of
   the City and planning escapes for the souls of others--escapes not to
   the other world, but to purity and peace and righteousness in this. In
   reality Christ never said "Save your soul." It is a mistranslation
   which says that. What He said was, "Save your life." And this not
   because the first is nothing, but only because it is so very great a
   thing that only the second can accomplish it. But the new word
   altruism--the translation of "love thy neighbour as thyself"--is slowly
   finding its way into current Christian speech. The People's Progress,
   not less than the Pilgrim's Progress, is daily becoming a graver
   concern to the Church. A popular theology with unselfishness as part at
   least of its root, a theology which appeals no longer to fear, but to
   the generous heart in man, has already dawned, and more clearly than
   ever men are beginning to see what Christ really came into this world
   to do.

   What Christ came here for was to make a better world. The world in
   which we live is an unfinished world. It is not wise, it is not happy,
   it is not pure, it is not good--it is not even sanitary. Humanity is
   little more than raw material. Almost everything has yet to be done to
   it. Before the days of Geology people thought the earth was finished.
   It is by no means finished. The work of Creation is going on. Before
   the spectroscope, men thought the universe was finished. We know now it
   is just beginning. And this teeming universe of men in which we live
   has almost all its finer colour and beauty yet to take. Christ came to
   complete it. The fires of its passions were not yet cool; their heat
   had to be transformed into finer energies. The ideals for its future
   were all to shape, the forces to realize them were not yet born. The
   poison of its sins had met no antidote, the gloom of its doubt no
   light, the weight of its sorrow no rest. These the Saviour of the
   world, the Light of men, would do and be. This, roughly, was His
   scheme.

   Now this was a prodigious task--to recreate the world. How was it to be
   done? God's way of making worlds is to make them make themselves. When
   He made the earth He made a rough ball of matter and supplied it with a
   multitude of tools to mould it into form--the rain-drop to carve it,
   the glacier to smooth it, the river to nourish it, the flower to adorn
   it. God works always with agents, and this is our way when we want any
   great thing done, and this was Christ's way when He undertook the
   finishing of Humanity. He had a vast intractable mass of matter to deal
   with, and He required a multitude of tools. Christ's tools were men.
   Hence His first business in the world was to make a collection of men.
   In other words He founded a Society.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FOUNDING OF THE SOCIETY

   IT is a somewhat startling thought--it will not be misunderstood--that
   Christ probably did not save many people while He was here. Many an
   evangelist, in that direction, has done much more. He never intended to
   finish the world single-handed, but announced from the first that
   others would not only take part, but do "greater things" than He. For
   amazing as was the attention He was able to give to individuals, this
   was not the whole aim He had in view. His immediate work was to enlist
   men in His enterprise, to rally them into a great company or Society
   for the carrying out of His plans.

   The name by which this Society was known was The Kingdom of God. Christ
   did not coin this name; it was an old expression, and good men had
   always hoped and prayed that some such Society would be born in their
   midst. But it was never either defined or set agoing in earnest until
   Christ made its realization the passion of His life.

   How keenly He felt regarding His task, how enthusiastically He set
   about it, every page of His life bears witness. All reformers have one
   or two great words which they use incessantly, and by mere reiteration
   imbed indelibly in the thought and history of their time. Christ's
   great word was the Kingdom of God. Of all the words of His that have
   come down to us this is by far the commonest. One hundred times it
   occurs in the Gospels. When He preached He had almost always this for a
   text. His sermons were explanations of the aims of His Society, of the
   different things it was like, of whom its membership consisted, what
   they were to do or to be, or not do or not be. And even when He does
   not actually use the word, it is easy to see that all He said and did
   had reference to this. Philosophers talk about thinking in categories--
   the mind living, as it were, in a particular room with its own special
   furniture, pictures, and viewpoints, these giving a consistent
   direction and colour to all that is there thought or expressed. It was
   in the category of the Kingdom that Christ's thought moved. Though one
   time He said He came to save the lost, or at another time to give men
   life, or to do His Father's will, these were all included among the
   objects of His Society.

   No one can ever know what Christianity is till he has grasped this
   leading thought in the mind of Christ. Peter and Paul have many
   wonderful and necessary things to tell us about what Christ was and
   did; but we are looking now at what Christ's own thought was. Do not
   think this is a mere modern theory. These are His own life-plans taken
   from His own lips. Do not allow any isolated text, even though it seem
   to sum up for you the Christian life, to keep you from trying to
   understand Christ's Programme as a whole. The perspective of Christ's
   teaching is not everything, but without it everything will be distorted
   and untrue. There is much good in a verse, but often much evil. To see
   some small soul pirouetting throughout life on a single text, and
   judging all the world because it cannot find a partner, is not a
   Christian sight. Christianity does not grudge such souls their comfort.
   What it grudges is that they make Christ's Kingdom uninhabitable to
   thoughtful minds. Be sure that whenever the religion of Christ appears
   small, or forbidding, or narrow, or inhuman, you are dealing not with
   the whole --which is a matchless moral symmetry-- nor even with an arch
   or column--for every detail is perfect--but with some cold stone
   removed from its place and suggesting nothing of the glorious structure
   from which it came.

   Tens of thousands of persons who are familiar with religious truths
   have not noticed yet that Christ ever founded a Society at all. The
   reason is partly that people have read texts instead of reading their
   Bible, partly that they have studied Theology instead of studying
   Christianity, and partly because of the noiselessness and invisibility
   of the Kingdom of God itself. Nothing truer was ever said of this
   Kingdom than that "It cometh without observation."  Its first
   discovery, therefore, comes to the Christian with all the force of a
   revelation. The sense of belonging to such a Society transforms life.
   It is the difference between being a solitary knight tilting
   single-handed, and often defeated, at whatever enemy one chances to
   meet on one's little acre of life, and the feel of belonging to a
   mighty army marching throughout all time to a certain victory. This
   note of universality given to even the humblest work we do, this sense
   of comradeship, this link with history, this thought of a definite
   campaign, this promise of success, is the possession of every obscurest
   unit in the Kingdom of God.

  THE PROGRAMME OF THE SOCIETY

   HUNDREDS of years before Christ's Society was formed, its Programme had
   been issued to the world. I cannot think of any scene in history more
   dramatic than when Jesus entered the church in Nazareth and read it to
   the people. Not that when He appropriated to Himself that venerable
   fragment from Isaiah He was uttering a manifesto or announcing His
   formal Programme. Christ never did things formally. We think of the
   words, as He probably thought of them, not in their old-world
   historical significance, nor as a full expression of His future aims,
   but as a summary of great moral facts now and always to be realized in
   the world since he appeared.

   Remember as you read the words to what grim reality they refer. Recall
   what Christ's problem really was, what His Society was founded for.
   This Programme deals with a real world. Think of it as you read--not of
   the surface-world, but of the world as it is, as it sins and weeps, and
   curses and suffers and sends up its long cry to God. Limit it if you
   like to the world around your door, but think of it-- of the city and
   the hospital and the dungeon and the graveyard, of the sweating-shop
   and the pawn-shop and the drink-shop; think of the cold, the cruelty,
   the fever, the famine, the ugliness, the loneliness, the pain. And then
   try to keep down the lump in your throat as you take up His Programme
   and read--


   TO BIND UP THE BROKEN-HEARTED:

   TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES:

   TO COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN:

   TO GIVE UNTO THEM--

   BEAUTY FOR ASHES,

   THE OIL OF JOY FOR MOURNING,

   THE GARMENT OF PRAISE FOR THE SPIRIT OF HEAVINESS.

   What an exchange--Beauty for Ashes, Joy for Mourning, Liberty for
   Chains! No marvel "the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
   fastened on Him" as He read; or that they "wondered at the gracious
   words which proceeded out of His lips." Only one man in that
   congregation, only one man in the world to-day could hear these accents
   with dismay--the man, the culprit, who has said hard words of Christ.

   We are all familiar with the protest  "Of course"--as if there were no
   other alternative to a person of culture--"Of course I am not a
   Christian, but I always speak respectfully of Christianity."
   Respectfully of Christianity! No remark fills one's soul with such
   sadness. One can understand a man as he reads these words being
   stricken speechless; one can see the soul within him rise to a white
   heat as each fresh benediction falls upon his ear and drive him, a
   half-mad enthusiast, to bear them to the world. But in what school has
   he learned of Christ who offers the Saviour of the world his respect?

   Men repudiate Christ's religion because they think it a small and
   limited thing, a scheme with no large human interests to commend it to
   this great social age. I ask you to note that there is not one burning
   interest of the human race which is not represented here. What are the
   great words of Christianity according to this Programme? Take as
   specimens these:


   LIBERTY,

   COMFORT,

   BEAUTY,

   JOY.

   These are among the greatest words of life. Give them their due
   extension, the significance which Christ undoubtedly saw in them and
   which Christianity undoubtedly yields, and there is almost no great
   want or interest of mankind which they do not cover.

   These are not only the greatest words of life but they are the best.
   This Programme, to those who have misread Christianity, is a series of
   surprises. Observe the most prominent note in it. It is gladness. Its
   first word is "good-tidings," its last is "joy." The saddest words of
   life are also there--but there as the diseases which Christianity comes
   to cure. No life that is occupied with such an enterprise could be
   other than radiant. The contribution of Christianity to the joy of
   living, perhaps even more to the joy of thinking, is unspeakable. The
   joyful life is the life of the larger mission, the disinterested life,
   the life of the overflow from self, the "more abundant life" which
   comes from following Christ. And the joy of thinking is the larger
   thinking, the thinking of the man who holds in his hand some Programme
   for Humanity. The Christian is the only man who has any Programme at
   all-- any Programme either for the world or for himself. Goethe, Byron,
   Carlyle taught Humanity much, but they had no Programme for it. Byron's
   thinking was suffering; Carlisle's despair. Christianity alone exults.
   The belief in the universe as moral, the interpretation of history as
   progress, the faith in good as eternal, in evil as self-consuming, in
   humanity as evolving--these Christian ideas have transformed the malady
   of thought into a bounding hope. It was no sentiment but a conviction
   matured amid calamity and submitted to the tests of life that inspired
   the great modern poet of optimism to proclaim:--


   "Gladness be with thee, Helper of the world!

   I think this is the authentic sign and seal

   Of Godship, that it ever waxes glad,

   And more glad, until gladness blossoms, bursts

   Into a rage to suffer for mankind

   And recommence at sorrow."

   But that is not all. Man's greatest needs are often very homely. And it
   is almost as much in its fearless recognition of the commonplace woes
   of life, and its deliberate offerings to minor needs, that the claims
   of Christianity to be a religion for Humanity stand. Look, for
   instance, at the closing sentence of this Programme. Who would have
   expected to find among the special objects of Christ's solicitude the
   Spirit of Heaviness? Supreme needs, many and varied, had been already
   dealt with on this Programme; many applicants had been met; the list is
   about to close. Suddenly the writer remembers the nameless malady of
   the poor--that mysterious disease which the rich share but cannot
   alleviate, which is too subtle for doctors, too incurable for
   Parliaments, too unpicturesque for philanthropy, too common even for
   sympathy. Can Christ meet that?

   If Christianity could even deal with the world's Depression, could cure
   mere dull spirits, it would be the Physician of Humanity. But it can.
   It has the secret, a hundred secrets, for the lifting of the world's
   gloom. It cannot immediately remove the physiological causes of
   dulness-- though obedience to its principles can do an infinity to
   prevent them, and its inspirations can do even more to lift the mind
   above them. But where the causes are moral or mental or social the
   remedy is in every Christian's hand. Think of any one at this moment
   whom the Spirit of Heaviness haunts. You think of a certain old woman.
   But you know for a fact that you can cure her. You did so, perfectly,
   only a week ago. A mere visit, and a little present, or the visit
   without any present, set her up for seven long days, and seven long
   nights. The machinery of the Kingdom is very simple and very silent,
   and the most silent parts do most, and we all believe so little in the
   medicines of Christ that we do not know what ripples of healing are set
   in motion when we simply smile on one another. Christianity wants
   nothing so much in the world as sunny people, and the old are hungrier
   for love than for bread, and the Oil of Joy is very cheap, and if you
   can help the poor on with a Garment of Praise, it will be better for
   them than blankets.

   Or perhaps you know someone else who is dull--not an old woman this
   time, but a very rich and important man. But you also know perfectly
   what makes him dull. It is either his riches or his importance.
   Christianity can cure either of these though you may not be the person
   to apply the cure--at a single hearing. Or here is a third case, one of
   your own servants. It is a case of monotony. Prescribe more variety,
   leisure, recreation--anything to relieve the wearing strain. A fourth
   case--your most honoured guest: Condition--leisure, health,
   accomplishments, means; Disease--Spiritual Obesity; Treatment--talent
   to be put out to usury. And so on down the whole range of life's
   dejection and ennui.

   Perhaps you tell me this is not Christianity at all; that everybody
   could do that. The curious thing is that everybody does not. Good-will
   to men came into the world with Christ, and wherever that is found, in
   Christian or heathen land, there Christ is, and there His Spirit works.
   And if you say that the chief end of Christianity is not the world's
   happiness, I agree; it was never meant to be; but the strange fact is
   that, without making it its chief end, it wholly and infallibly, and
   quite universally, leads to it. Hence the note of Joy, though not the
   highest on Christ's Programme, is a loud and ringing note, and none who
   serve in His Society can be long without its music. Time was when a
   Christian used to apologize for being happy. But the day has always
   been when he ought to apologize for being miserable.

   Christianity, you will observe, really works. And it succeeds not only
   because it is divine, but because it is so very human--because it is
   common-sense. Why should the Garment of Praise destroy the Spirit of
   Heaviness? Because an old woman cannot sing and cry at the same moment.
   The Society of Christ is a sane Society. Its methods are rational. The
   principle in the old woman's case is simply that one emotion destroys
   another. Christianity works, as a railway man would say, with points.
   It switches souls from valley lines to mountain lines, not stemming the
   currents of life but diverting them.  In the rich man's case the
   principle of cure is different, but it is again principle, not
   necromancy. His spirit of heaviness is caused, like any other
   heaviness, by the earth's attraction. Take away the earth and you take
   away the attraction. But if Christianity can do anything it can take
   away the earth. By the wider extension of horizon which it gives, by
   the new standard of values, by the mere setting of life's small pomps
   and interests and admirations in the light of the Eternal, it
   dissipates the world with a breath. All that tends to abolish
   worldliness tends to abolish unrest, and hence, in the rush of modern
   life, one far-reaching good of all even commonplace Christian
   preaching, all Christian literature, all which holds the world doggedly
   to the idea of a God and a future life, and reminds mankind of Infinity
   and Eternity.

   Side by side with these influences, yet taking the world at a wholly
   different angle, works another great Christian force. How many
   opponents of religion are aware that one of the specific objects of
   Christ's society is Beauty? The charge of vulgarity against
   Christianity is an old one. If it means that Christianity deals with
   the ruder elements in human nature, it is true, and that is its glory.
   But if it means that it has no respect for the finer qualities, the
   charge is baseless. For Christianity not only encourages whatsoever
   things are lovely, but wars against that whole theory of life which
   would exclude them. It prescribes aestheticism. It proscribes
   asceticism. And for those who preach to Christians that in these
   enlightened days they must raise the masses by giving them noble
   sculptures and beautiful paintings and music and public parks, the
   answer is that these things are all already being given, and given
   daily, and with an increasing sense of their importance, by the Society
   of Christ. Take away from the world the beautiful things which have not
   come from Christ and you will make it poorer scarcely at all. Take away
   from modern cities the paintings, the monuments, the music for the
   people, the museums and the parks which are not the gifts of Christian
   men and Christian municipalities, and in ninety cases out of a hundred
   you will leave them unbereft of so much as a well-shaped lamp-post

   It is impossible to doubt that the Decorator of the World shall not
   continue to serve to His later children, and in ever finer forms, the
   inspirations of beautiful things. More fearlessly than he has ever
   done, the Christian of modern life will use the noble spiritual
   leverages of Art. That this world, the people's world, is a bleak and
   ugly world, we do not forget; it is ever with us. But we esteem too
   little the mission of beautiful things in haunting the mind with higher
   thoughts and begetting the mood which leads to God. Physical beauty
   makes moral beauty. Loveliness does more than destroy ugliness; it
   destroys matter. A mere touch of it in a room, in a street, even on a
   door knocker, is a spiritual force. Ask the working-man's wife, and she
   will tell you there is a moral effect even in a clean table-cloth. If a
   barrel-organ in a slum can but drown a curse, let no Christian silence
   it. The mere light and colour of the wall-advertisements are a gift of
   God to the poor man's sombre world.

   One Christmas-time a poor drunkard told me that he had gone out the
   night before to take his usual chance of the temptations of the street.
   Close to his door, at a shop window, an angel--so he said--arrested
   him. It was a large Christmas-card, a glorious white thing with tinsel
   wings, and as it glittered in the gas-light it flashed into his soul a
   sudden thought of Heaven. It recalled the earlier heaven of his
   infancy, and he thought of his mother in the distant glen, and how it
   would please her if she got this Christmas angel from her prodigal.
   With money already pledged to the devil he bought the angel, and with
   it a new soul and future for himself. That was a real angel. For that
   day as I saw its tinsel pinions shine in his squalid room I knew what
   Christ's angels were. They are all beautiful things, which daily in
   common homes are bearing up heavy souls to God.

   But do not misunderstand me. This angel was made of pasteboard: a
   pasteboard angel can never save a soul. Tinsel reflects the sun, but
   warms nothing. Our Programme must go deeper. Beauty may arrest the
   drunkard, but it cannot cure him.

   It is here that Christianity asserts itself with a supreme
   individuality. It is here that it parts company with Civilization, with
   Politics, with all secular schemes of Social Reform. In its diagnosis
   of human nature it finds that which most other systems ignore; which,
   if they see, they cannot cure; which, left undestroyed, makes every
   reform futile, and every inspiration vain. That thing is Sin.
   Christianity, of all other philanthropies, recognizes that man's
   devouring need is Liberty--liberty to stop sinning; to leave the prison
   of his passions, and shake off the fetters of his past. To surround
   Captives with statues and pictures, to offer Them-that-are-Bound a
   higher wage or a cleaner street or a few more cubic feet of air per
   head, is solemn trifling. It is a cleaner soul they want; a purer air,
   or any air at all, for their higher selves.

   And where the cleaner soul is to come from apart from Christ I cannot
   tell. "By no political alchemy," Herbert Spencer tells us, "can you get
   golden conduct out of leaden instincts." The power to set the heart
   right, to renew the springs of action, comes from Christ. The sense of
   the infinite worth of the single soul, and the recoverableness of man
   at his worst, are the gifts of Christ. The freedom from guilt, the
   forgiveness of sins, come from Christ's Cross; the hope of immortality
   springs from Christ's grave. We believe in the gospel of better laws
   and an improved environment; we hold the religion of Christ to be a
   social religion; we magnify and call Christian the work of reformers,
   statesmen, philanthropists, educators, inventors, sanitary officers,
   and all who directly or remotely aid, abet, or further the higher
   progress of mankind; but in Him alone, in the fulness of that word, do
   we see the Saviour of the world.

   There are earnest and gifted lives to-day at work among the poor whose
   lips at least will not name the name of Christ. I speak of them with
   respect; their shoe-latchets many of us are not worthy to unloose. But
   because the creed of the neighbouring mission-hall is a travesty of
   religion they refuse to acknowledge the power of the living Christ to
   stop man's sin, of the dying Christ to forgive it. O, narrowness of
   breadth! Because there are ignorant doctors do I yet rail at medicine
   or start an hospital of my own? Because the poor raw evangelist, or the
   narrow ecclesiastic, offer their little all to the poor, shall I
   repudiate all they do not know of Christ because of the little that
   they do know? Of gospels for the poor which have not some theory, state
   it how you will, of personal conversion one cannot have much hope.
   Personal conversion means for life a personal religion, a personal
   trust in God, a personal debt to Christ, a personal dedication to His
   cause. These, brought about how you will, are supreme things to aim at,
   supreme losses if they are missed. Sanctification will come to masses
   only as it comes to individual men; and to work with Christ's Programme
   and ignore Christ is to utilize the sun's light without its energy.

   But this is not the only point at which the uniqueness of this Society
   appears. There is yet another depth in humanity which no other system
   even attempts to sound. We live in a world not only of sin but of
   sorrow--


   "There is no flock, however watched and tended,

   But one dead lamb is there;

   There is no home, howe'er defended,

   But has one vacant chair."

   When the flock thins, and the chair empties, who is to be near to heal?
   At that moment the gospels of the world are on trial. In the presence
   of death how will they act? Act! They are blotted out of existence.
   Philosophy, Politics, Reforms, are no more. The Picture Galleries
   close. The sculptures hide. The Committees disperse. There is crape on
   the door; the world withdraws. Observe, it withdraws. It has no
   mission.

   So awful in its loneliness was this hour that the Romans paid a
   professional class; to step in with its mummeries and try to fill it.
   But that is Christ's own hour. Next to Righteousness the greatest word
   of Christianity is Comfort. Christianity has almost a monopoly of
   Comfort Renan was never nearer the mark than when he spoke of the Bible
   as "the great Book of the Consolation of Humanity." Christ's Programme
   is full of Comfort, studded with Comfort: "to bind up the
   Broken-Hearted, to Comfort all that mourn, to Give unto them that mourn
   in Zion." Even the "good tidings" to the "meek" are, in the Hebrew, a
   message to the "afflicted" or "the poor." The word Gospel itself comes
   down through the Greek from this very passage, so that whatever else
   Christ's Gospel means it is first an Evangel for suffering men.

   One note in this Programme jars with all the rest. When Christ read
   from Isaiah that day He never finished the passage. A terrible word,
   Vengeance, yawned like a precipice across His path; and in the middle
   of a sentence "He closed the Book, and gave it again to the minister,
   and sat down". A Day of Vengeance from our God--these were the words
   before which Christ paused. When the prophet proclaimed it some great
   historical fulfilment was in his mind. Had the people to whom Christ
   read been able to understand its ethical equivalents He would probably
   have read on. For, so understood, instead of filling the mind with
   fear, the thought of this dread Day inspires it with a solemn
   gratitude. The work of the Avenger is a necessity. It is part of God's
   philanthropy.

   For I have but touched the surface in speaking of the sorrow of the
   world as if it came from people dying. It comes from people living.
   Before ever the Broken-Hearted can be healed a hundred greater causes
   of suffering than death must be destroyed. Before the Captive can be
   free a vaster prison than his own sins must be demolished. There are
   hells on earth into which no breath of heaven can ever come; these must
   be swept away. There are social soils in which only unrighteousness can
   flourish; these must be broken up.

   And that is the work of the Day of Vengeance. When is that day? It is
   now. Who is the Avenger? Law. What Law? Criminal Law, Sanitary Law,
   Social Law, Natural Law. Wherever the poor are trodden upon or tread
   upon one another; wherever the air is poison and the water foul;
   wherever want stares, and vice reigns, and rags rot--there the Avenger
   takes his stand. Whatever makes it more difficult for the drunkard to
   reform, for the children to be pure, for the widow to earn a wage, for
   any of the wheels of progress to revolve--with these he deals. Delay
   him not. He is the messenger of Christ. Despair of him not, distrust
   him not. His Day dawns slowly, but his work is sure. Though evil stalks
   the world, it is on the way to execution; though wrong reigns, it must
   end in self-combustion. The very nature of things is God's Avenger; the
   very story of civilization is the history of Christ's Throne.

   Anything that prepares the way for a better social state is the fit
   work of the followers of Christ. Those who work on the more spiritual
   levels leave too much unhonoured the slow toil of multitudes of
   unchurched souls who prepare the material or moral environments without
   which these higher labours are in vain. Prevention is Christian as well
   as cure; and Christianity travels sometimes by the most circuitous
   paths. It is given to some to work for immediate results, and from year
   to year they are privileged to reckon up a balance of success. But
   these are not always the greatest in the Kingdom of God. The men who
   get no stimulus from any visible reward, whose lives pass while the
   objects for which they toil are still too far away to comfort them; the
   men who hold aloof from dazzling schemes and earn the misunderstanding
   of the crowd because they foresee remoter issues, who even oppose a
   seeming good because a deeper evil lurks beyond--these are the
   statesmen of the Kingdom of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE MACHINERY OF THE SOCIETY

   SUCH in dimmest outline is the Programme of Christ's Society. Did you
   know that all this was going on in the world? Did you know that
   Christianity was such a living and purpose-like thing? Look back to the
   day when that Programme was given, and you will see that it was not
   merely written on paper. Watch the drama of the moral order rise up,
   scene after scene, in history. Study the social evolution of humanity,
   the spread of righteousness, the amelioration of life, the freeing of
   slaves, the elevation of woman, the purification of religion, and ask
   what these can be if not the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth. For
   it is precisely through the movements of nations and the lives of men
   that this Kingdom comes. Christ might have done all this work Himself,
   with His own hands. But He did not. The crowning wonder of His scheme
   is that He entrusted it to men. It is the supreme glory of humanity
   that the machinery for its redemption should have been placed within
   itself. I think the saddest thing in Christ's life was that after
   founding a Society with aims so glorious He had to go away and leave
   it.

   But in reality He did not leave it. The old theory that God made the
   world, made it as an inventor would make a machine, and then stood
   looking on to see it work, has passed away. God is no longer a remote
   spectator of the natural world, but immanent in it, pervading matter by
   His present Spirit, and ordering it by His Will. So Christ is immanent
   in men. His work is to move the hearts and inspire the lives of men,
   and through such hearts to move and reach the world. Men, only men, can
   carry out this work. This humanness, this inwardness, of the Kingdom is
   one reason why some scarcely see that it exists at all. We measure
   great movements by the loudness of their advertisement, or the place
   their externals fill in the public eye. This Kingdom has no externals.
   The usual methods of propagating a great cause were entirely discarded
   by Christ. The sword He declined; money He had none; literature He
   never used; the Church disowned Him; the State crucified Him. Planting
   His ideals in the hearts of a few poor men, He started them out
   unheralded to revolutionize the world. They did it by making friends
   and by making enemies; they went about, did good, sowed seed, died, and
   lived again in the lives of those they helped. These in turn, a
   fraction of them, did the same. They met, they prayed, they talked of
   Christ, they loved, they went among other men, and by act and word
   passed on their secret. The machinery of the Kingdom of God is purely
   social. It acts, not by commandment, but by contagion; not by fiat, but
   by friendship. "The Kingdom of God is like unto leaven, which a woman
   took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened."

   After all, like all great discoveries once they are made, this seems
   absolutely the most feasible method that could have been devised. Men
   must live among men. Men must influence men. Organizations,
   institutions, churches, have too much rigidity for a thing that is to
   flood the world. The only fluid in the world is man. War might have won
   for Christ's cause a passing victory; wealth might have purchased a
   superficial triumph; political power might have gained a temporary
   success. But in these, there is no note of universality, of solidarity,
   of immortality. To live through the centuries and pervade the uttermost
   ends of the earth, to stand while kingdoms tottered and civilizations
   changed, to survive fallen churches and crumbling creeds--there was no
   soil for the Kingdom of God like the hearts of common men. Some who
   have written about this Kingdom have emphasized its moral grandeur,
   others its universality, others its adaptation to man's needs. One
   great writer speaks of its prodigious originality, another chiefly
   notices its success. I confess what almost strikes me most is the
   miracle of its simplicity.

   Men, then, are the only means God's Spirit has of accomplishing His
   purpose. What men? You. Is it worth doing, or is it not? Is it worth
   while joining Christ's Society or is it not? What do you do all day?
   What is your personal stake in the coming of the Kingdom of Christ on
   earth? You are not interested in religion, you tell me; you do not care
   for your "soul". It was not about your religion I ventured to ask,
   still less about your soul. That you have no religion, that you do not
   care for your soul, does not absolve you from caring for the world in
   which you live. But you do not believe in this church, you reply, or
   accept this doctrine, or that. Christ does not, in the first instance,
   ask your thoughts, but your work. No man has a right to postpone his
   life for the sake of his thoughts. Why? Because this is a real world,
   not a think world. Treat it as a real world-- act. Think by all means,
   but think also of what is actual, of what like the stern world is, of
   low much even you, creedless and churchless, could do to make it
   better. The thing to be anxious about is not to be right with man, but
   with mankind. And, so far as I know, there is nothing so on all fours
   with mankind as Christianity.

   There are versions of Christianity, it is true, which no
   self-respecting mind can do other than disown--versions so hard, so
   narrow, so unreal, so super-theological, that practical men can find in
   them neither outlet for their lives nor resting-place for their
   thoughts. With these we have nothing to do. With these Christ had
   nothing to do-- except to oppose them with every word and act of His
   life. It too seldom occurs to those who repudiate Christianity because
   of its narrowness or its unpracticalness, its sanctimoniousness or its
   dulness, that these were the very things which Christ strove against
   and unweariedly condemned. It was the one risk of His religion being
   given to the common people--an inevitable risk which He took without
   reserve--that its infinite lustre should be tarnished in the fingering
   of the crowd or have its great truths narrowed into mean and unworthy
   moulds as they passed from lip to lip. But though the crowd is the
   object of Christianity, it is not its custodian. Deal with the Founder
   of this great Commonwealth Himself. Any man of honest purpose who will
   take the trouble to inquire at first hand what Christianity really is,
   will find it a thing he cannot get away from. Without either argument
   or pressure, by the mere practicalness of its aims and the pathos of
   its compassions, it forces its august claim upon every serious life.

   He who joins this Society finds himself in a large place. The Kingdom
   of God is a Society of the best men, working for the best ends,
   according to the best methods. Its membership is a multitude whom no
   man can number; its methods are as various as human nature; its field
   is the world. It is a Commonwealth, yet it honours a King; it is a
   Social Brotherhood, but it acknowledges the Fatherhood of God. Though
   not a Philosophy the world turns to it for light; though not Political
   it is the incubator of all great laws. It is more human than the State,
   for it deals with deeper needs; more Catholic than the Church, for it
   includes whom the Church rejects. It is a Propaganda, yet it works not
   by agitation but by ideals. It is a Religion, yet it holds the worship
   of God to be mainly the service of man. Though not a Scientific Society
   its watchword is Evolution; though not an Ethic it possesses the Sermon
   on the Mount. This mysterious Society owns no wealth but distributes
   fortunes. It has no minutes for history keeps them; no member's roll
   for no one could make it. Its entry-money is nothing; its subscription,
   all you have The Society never meets and it never adjourns. Its law is
   one word-- loyalty; its Gospel one message -- love. Verily "Whosoever
   will lose his life for My sake shall find it."

   The Programme for the other life is not out yet. For this world, for
   these faculties, for his one short life, I know nothing that is offered
   to man to compare with membership in the Kingdom of God. Among the
   mysteries which compass the world beyond, none is greater than how
   there can be in store for man a work more wonderful, a life more
   God-like than this. If you know anything better, live for it; if not,
   in the name of God and of Humanity, carry out Christ's plan.

THE CITY WITHOUT A CHURCH

   I, John,

   Saw the Holy City,

   New Jerusalem,

   Coming down from God out of Heaven.

   *    *    *

   And I saw no Temple therein.

   *    *    *

   And His servants shall serve Him;

   And they shall see His Face;

   And His Name shall be written on their foreheads.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I SAW THE CITY

   TWO very startling things arrest us in John's vision of the future. The
   first is that the likest thing to Heaven he could think of was a City;
   the second, that there was no Church in that City.

   Almost nothing more revolutionary could be said, even to the modern
   world, in the name of religion. No Church--that is the defiance of
   religion; a City--that is the antipodes of Heaven. Yet John combines
   these contradictions in one daring image, and holds up to the world the
   picture of a City without a Church as his ideal of the heavenly life.

   By far the most original thing here is the simple conception of Heaven
   as a City. The idea of religion without a Church-- "I saw no Temple
   therein"--is anomalous enough; but the association of the blessed life
   with aCity--the one place in the world from which Heaven seems most far
   away-- is something wholly new in religious thought. No other religion
   which has a Heaven ever had a Heaven like this. The Greek, if he looked
   forward at all, awaited the Elysian Fields; the Eastern sought Nirvana.
   All other Heavens have been Gardens, Dreamlands--passivities more or
   less aimless. Even to the majority among ourselves Heaven is a siesta
   and not a City. It remained for John to go straight to the other
   extreme and select the citadel of the world's fever, the ganglion of
   its unrest, the heart and focus of its most strenuous toil, as the
   framework for his ideal of the blessed life.

   The Heaven of Christianity is different from all other Heavens, because
   the religion of Christianity is different from all other religions.
   Christianity is the religion of Cities. It moves among real things. Its
   sphere is the street, the market-place, the working-life of the world.

   And what interests one for the present in John's vision is not so much
   what it reveals of a Heaven beyond, but what it suggests of the nature
   of the heavenly life in this present world. Find out what a man's
   Heaven is-- no matter whether it be a dream or a reality, no matter
   whether it refer to an actual Heaven or to a Kingdom of God to be
   realized on earth--and you pass by an easy discovery to what his
   religion is; And herein lies one value at least of thisallegory. It is
   a touchstone for Christianity, a test for the solidity or the
   insipidity of one's religion, for the wholesomeness or the fatuousness
   of one's faith, for the usefulness or the futility of one's life. For
   this vision of the City marks off in lines which no eye can mistake the
   true area which the religion of Christ is meant to inhabit, and
   announces for all time the real nature of the saintly life.

   City life is human life at its intensest, man in his most real
   relations. And the nearer one draws to reality, the nearer one draws to
   the working sphere of religion. Wherever real life is, there Christ
   goes. And He goes there, not only because the great need lies there,
   but because there is found, so to speak, the raw material with which
   Christianity works--the life of man. To do something with this, to
   infuse something into this, to save and inspire and sanctify this, the
   actual working life of the world, is what He came for. Without human
   life to act upon, without the relations of men with one another, of
   master with servant, husband with wife, buyer with seller, creditor
   with debtor, there is no such thing as Christianity. With actual
   things, with Humanity in its everyday dress, with the traffic of the
   streets, with gates and houses, with work and wages, with sin and
   poverty, with these things, and all the things and all the relations
   and all the people of the City, Christianity has to do and has more to
   do than with anything else. To conceive of the Christian religion as
   itself a thing--a something which can exist apart from life; to think
   of it as something added on to being, something kept in a separate
   compartment called the soul, as an extra accomplishment like music, or
   a special talent like art, is totally to misapprehend its nature. It is
   that which fills all compartments. It is that which makes the whole
   life music and every separate action a work of art. Take away action
   and it is not. Take away people, houses, streets, character, and it
   ceases to be. Without these there may be sentiment, or rapture, or
   adoration, or superstition; there may even be religion, but there can
   never be the religion of the Son of Man.

   If Heaven were a siesta, religion might be conceived of as a reverie.
   If the future life were to be mainly spent in a Temple, the present
   life might be mainly spent in Church. But if Heaven be a City, the life
   of those who are going there must be a real life. The man who would
   enter John's Heaven, no matter what piety or what faith he may profess,
   must be a real man. Christ's gift to men was life, a rich and abundant
   life. And life is meant for living. An abundant life does not show
   itself in abundant dreaming, but in abundant living--in abundant living
   among real and tangible objects and to actual and practical purposes.
   "His servants," John tells us, "shall serve." In this vision of the
   City he confronts us with a new definition of a Christian man-- the
   perfect saint is the perfect citizen.

   To make Cities--that is what we are here for. To make good Cities--that
   is for the present hour the main work of Christianity. For the City is
   strategic. It makes the towns: the towns make the villages; the
   villages make the country. He who makes the City makes the world. After
   all, though men make Cities, it is Cities which make men. Whether our
   national life is great or mean, whether our social virtues are mature
   or stunted, whether our sons are moral or vicious, whether religion is
   possible or impossible, depends upon the City. When Christianity shall
   take upon itself in full responsibility the burden and care of Cities
   the Kingdom of God will openly come on earth. What Christianity waits
   for also, as its final apologetic and justification to the world, is
   the founding of a City which shall be in visible reality a City of God.
   People do not dispute that religion is in the Church. What is now
   wanted is to let them see it in the City. One Christian City, one City
   in any part of the earth, whose citizens from the greatest to the
   humblest lived in the spirit of Christ, where religion had overflowed
   the Churches and passed into the streets, inundating every house and
   workshop, and permeating the whole social and commercial life--one such
   Christian City would seal the redemption of the world.

   Some such City, surely, was what John saw in his dream. Whatever
   reference we may find there to a world to come, is it not equally
   lawful to seek the scene upon this present world? John saw his City
   descending out of Heaven. It was, moreover, no strange apparition, but
   a City which he knew. It was Jerusalem, a new Jerusalem. The
   significance of that name has been altered for most of us by religious
   poetry; we spell it with a capital and speak of the New Jerusalem as a
   synonym for Heaven. Yet why not take it simply as it stands, as a new
   Jerusalem? Try to restore the natural force of the expression--suppose
   John to have lived to-day and to have said London? "I saw a new
   London?" Jerusalem was John's London. All the grave and sad suggestion
   that the word London brings up to-day to the modern reformer, the word
   Jerusalem recalled to him. What in his deepest hours he longed and
   prayed for was a new Jerusalem, a reformed Jerusalem. And just as it is
   given to the man in modern England who is a prophet, to the man who
   believes in God and in the moral order of the world, to discern a new
   London shaping itself through all the sin and chaos of the City, so was
   it given to Johnto see a new Jerusalem rise from the ruins of the old.

   We have no concern--it were contrary to critical method--to press the
   allegory in detail. Whatwe take from it, looked at in this light, is
   the broad conception of a transformed City, the great Christian thought
   that the very Cities where we live, with all their suffering and sin,
   shall one day, by the gradual action of the forces of Christianity, be
   turned into Heavens on earth. This is a spectacle which profoundly
   concerns the world. To the reformer, the philanthropist, the economist,
   the politician, this Vision of the City is the great classic of social
   literature. What John saw, we may fairly take it, was the future of all
   Cities. It was the dawn of a new social order, a regenerate humanity, a
   purified society, an actual transformation of the Cities of the world
   into Cities of God.

   This City, then, which John saw is none other than your City, the place
   where you live--as it might be, and as you are to help to make it. It
   is London, Berlin, New York, Paris, Melbourne, Calcutta--these as they
   might be, and in some infinitesimal degree as they have already begun
   to be. In each of these, and in every City throughout the world to-day,
   there is a City descending out of Heaven from God. Each one of us is
   daily building up this City or helping to keep it back. Its walls rise
   slowly, but, as we believe in God, the building can never cease. For
   the might of those who build, be they few or many, is so surely greater
   than the might of those who retard, that no day's sun sets over any
   City in the land that does not see some stone of the invisible City
   laid. To believe this is faith. To live for this is Christianity.

   The project is delirious? Yes--to atheism. To John it was the most
   obvious thing in the world. Nay, knowing all he knew, its realization
   was inevitable. We forget, when the thing strikes us as strange, that
   John knew Christ. Christ was the Light of the World--the Light of the
   World. This is all that he meant by his Vision, that Christ is the
   Light of the World. This Light, John saw, would fall
   everywhere--especially upon Cities. It was irresistible and
   inextinguishable. No darkness could stand before it. One by one the
   Cities of the world would give up their night. Room by room, house by
   house, street by street, they would be changed. Whatsoever worketh
   abomination or maketh a lie would disappear. Sin, pain, sorrow, would
   silently pass away. One day the walls of the City would be jasper; the
   very streets would be paved with gold. Then the kings of the earth
   would bring their glory and honour into it. In the midst of the streets
   there should be a tree of Life. And its leaves would go forth for the
   healing of the nations.

   Survey the Cities of the world today, survey your own City--town,
   village, home --and prophesy. God's kingdom is surely to come in this
   world. God's will is surely to be done on earth as it is done in
   Heaven. Is not this one practicable way of realizing it? When a prophet
   speaks of something that is to be, that coming event is usually brought
   about by no unrelated cause or sudden shock, but in the ordered course
   of the world's drama. With Christianity as the supreme actor in the
   world's drama, the future of its Cities is even now quite clear.
   Project the lines of Christian and social progress to their still far
   off goal, and see even now that Heaven must come to earth.

  HIS SERVANTS SHALL SERVE

   IF any one wishes to know what he can do to help on the work of God in
   the world let him make a City, or a street, or a house of a City. Men
   complain of the indefiniteness of religion. There are thousands ready
   in their humble measure to offer some personal service for the good of
   men, but they do not know where to begin. Let me tell you where to
   begin--where Christ told His disciples to begin, at the nearest City. I
   promise you that before one week's work is over you will never again be
   haunted by the problem of the indefiniteness of Christianity. You will
   see so much to do, so many actual things to be set right, so many
   merely material conditions to alter, so much striving with employers of
   labour, and City councils, and trade agitators, and Boards, and
   Vestries, and Committees; so much pure unrelieved uninspiring hard
   work, that you will begin to wonder whether in all this naked realism
   you are on holy ground at all. Do not be afraid of missing Heaven in
   seeking a better earth. The distinction between secular and sacred is a
   confusion and not a contrast; and it is only because the secular is so
   intensely sacred that so many eyes are blind before it. The really
   secular thing in life is the spirit which despises under that name what
   is but part of the everywhere present work and will of God. Be sure
   that, down to the last and pettiest detail, all that concerns a better
   world isthe direct concern of Christ.

   I make this, then, in all seriousness as a definite practical proposal.
   You wish, you say, to be a religious man. Well, be one. There is your
   City; begin. But what are you to believe? Believe in your City. What
   else? In Jesus Christ. What about Him? That He wants to make your City
   better; that that is what He would be doing if He lived there. What
   else? Believe in yourself--that you, even you, can do some of the work
   which He would like done, and that unless you do it, it will remain
   undone. How are you to begin? As Christ did. First He looked at the
   City; then He wept over it; then He died for it.

   Where are you to begin? Begin where you are. Make that one corner,
   room, house, office as like Heaven as you can. Begin? Begin with the
   paper on the walls, make that beautiful; with the air, keep it fresh;
   with the very drains, make them sweet; with the furniture, see that it
   be honest. Abolish whatsoever worketh abomination--in food, in drink,
   in luxury, in books, in art; whatsoever maketh a lie--in conversation,
   in social intercourse, in correspondence, in domestic life. This done,
   you have arranged for aHeaven, but you have not got it. Heaven lies
   within, in kindness, in humbleness, inunselfishness, in faith, in love,
   in service. To get these in, get Christ in. Teach all in the house
   about Christ--what He did, and what He said, and how He lived, and how
   He died, and how He dwells in them, and how He makes all one. Teach it
   not as a doctrine, but as a discovery, as your own discovery. Live your
   own discovery.

   Then pass out into the City. Do all to it that you have done at home.
   Beautify it, ventilate it, drain it. Let nothing enter it that can
   defile the streets, the stage, the newspaper offices, the booksellers'
   counters; nothing that maketh a lie in its warehouses, its
   manufactures, its shops, its art galleries, its advertisements. Educate
   it, amuse it, church it. Christianize capital; dignify labour. Join
   Councils and Committees. Provide for the poor, the sick, and the widow.
   So will you serve the City.

   If you ask me which of all these things is the most important, I reply
   that among them there is only one thing of superlative importance and
   that is yourself. By far the greatest thing a man can do for his City
   is to be a good man. Simply to live there as a good man, as a Christian
   man of action and practical citizen, is the first and highest
   contribution any one can make to its salvation. Let a City be a Sodom
   or a Gomorrah, and if there be but ten righteous men in it, it will be
   saved.

   It is here that the older, the more individual, conception of
   Christianity, did such mighty work for the world--it produced good men.
   It is goodness that tells, goodness first and goodness last. Good men
   even with small views are immeasurably more important to the world than
   small men with great views. But given good men, such men as were
   produced even by the self-centred theology of an older generation, and
   add thatwider outlook and social ideal which are coming to be the
   characteristics of the religion of this age, and Christianity has an
   equipment for the reconstruction of the world, before which nothing can
   stand. Such good men will not merely content themselves with being good
   men. They will be forces--according to their measure, public forces.
   They will take the city in hand, some a house, some a street, and some
   the whole. Of set purpose they will serve. Not ostentatiously, but
   silently, in ways varied as human nature, and many as life's
   opportunities, they will minister to its good.

   To help the people, also, to be good people good fathers, and mothers,
   and sons, and citizens--is worth all else rolled into one. Arrange the
   government of the City as you may, perfect all its philanthropic
   machinery, make righteous its relations great and small, equip it with
   galleries and parks, and libraries and music, and carry out the whole
   programme of social reform, and the one thing needful is still without
   the gates. The gospel of material blessedness is part of a gospel--a
   great and Christian part-- but when held up as the whole gospel for the
   people it is as hollow as the void of life whose circumference even it
   fails to touch.

   There are countries in the world--new countries--where the people,
   rising to the rights of government, have already secured almost all
   that reformers cry for. The lot of the working man there is all but
   perfect. His wages are high, his leisure great, his home worthy. Yet in
   tens of thousands of cases the secret of life is unknown.

   It is idle to talk of Christ as a social reformer if by that is meant
   that His first concern was to improve the organization of society, or
   provide the world with better laws. These were among His objects, but
   His first was to provide the world with better men. The one need of
   every cause and every community still is for better men. If every
   workshop held a Workman like Him who worked in the carpenter's shop at
   Nazareth, the labour problem and all other workman's problems would
   soon be solved. If every street had a home or two like Mary's home in
   Bethany, the domestic life of the city would be transformed in three
   generations.

   External reforms-- education, civilization, public schemes, and public
   charities--have each their part to play. Any experiment that can
   benefit by one hairbreadth any single human life is a thousand times
   worth trying. There is no effort in any single one of these directions
   but must, as Christianity advances, be pressed by Christian men to ever
   further and fuller issues. But those whose hands have tried the ways,
   and the slow work of leavening men one by one with the spirit of Jesus
   Christ.

   The thought that the future, that any day, may see some new and mighty
   enterprise of redemption, some new departure in religion, which shall
   change everything with a breath and make all that is crooked straight,
   is not at all likely to be realized. There is nothing wrong with the
   lines on which redemption runs at present except the want of faith to
   believe in them, and the want of men to use them. The Kingdom of God is
   like leaven, and the leaven is with us now. The quantity at work in the
   world may increase but that is all. For nothing can ever be higher than
   the Spirit of Christ or more potent as a regenerating power on the
   lives of men.

   Do not charge me with throwing away my brief because I return to this
   old, old plea for the individual soul. I do not forget that my plea is
   for the City. But I plead for good men, because good men are good
   leaven. If their goodness stop short of that, if the leaven does not
   mix with that which is unleavened, if it does not do the work of
   leaven--that is, to raise something-- it is not the leaven of Christ.
   The question or good men to ask themselves is: Is my goodness helping
   others? Is it a private luxury, or is it telling upon the City? Is it
   bringing any single human soul nearer happiness or righteousness?

   If you ask what particular scheme you shall take up, I cannot answer.
   Christianity has no set schemes. It makes no choice between conflicting
   philanthropies, decides nothing between competing churches, favours no
   particular public policy, organizes no one line of private charity. It
   is not essential even for all of us to take any public or formal line.
   Christianity is not all carried on by Committees, and the Kingdom of
   God has other ways of coming than through municipal reforms. Most of
   the stones for the building of the City of God, and all the best of
   them, are made by mothers. But whether or no you shall work through
   public channels, or only serve Christ along the quieter paths of home,
   no man can determine but yourself.

   There is an almost awful freedom about Christ's religion. "I do not
   call you servants." He said, "for the servant knoweth not what his lord
   doeth. I have called you friends." As Christ's friends, His followers
   are supposed to know what He wants done, and for the same reason they
   will try to do it--this is the whole working basis of Christianity.
   Surely next to its love for the chief of sinners the most touching
   thing about the religion of Christ is its amazing trust in the least of
   saints. Here is the mightiest enterprise ever launched upon this earth,
   mightier even than its creation, for it is its re-creation, and the
   carrying of it out is left, so to speak, to haphazard--to individual
   loyalty, to free enthusiasms, to uncoerced activities, to an
   uncompelled response to the pressures of God's Spirit. Christ sets His
   followers no tasks. He appoints no hours. He allots no sphere. He
   Himself simply went about and did good. He did not stop life to do some
   special thing which should be called religious. His life was His
   religion. Each day as it came brought round in the ordinary course its
   natural ministry. Each village along the highway had someone waiting to
   be helped. His pulpit was the hillside, His congregation a woman at a
   well. The poor, wherever He met them, were His clients; the sick, as
   often as He found them, His opportunity. His work was everywhere; His
   workshop was the world. One's associations of Christ are all of the
   wayside. We never think of Him in connection with a Church We cannot
   picture Him in the garb of a priest or belonging to any of the classes
   who specialize religion. His service was of a universal human order. He
   was the Son of Man, the Citizen.

   This, remember, was the highest life ever lived, this informal
   citizen-life. So simple a thing it was, so natural, so human, that
   those who saw it first did not know it was religion, and Christ did not
   pass among them as a very religious man. Nay, it is certain, and it is
   an infinitely significant thought, that the religious people of His
   time not only refused to accept this type of religion as any kind of
   religion at all, but repudiated and denounced Him as its bitter enemy.

   Inability to discern what true religion is, is not confined to the
   Pharisees. Multitudes still who profess to belong to the religion of
   Christ, scarcely know it when they see it. The truth is, men will hold
   to almost anything in the name of Christianity, believe anything, do
   anything--except its common and obvious tasks. Great is the mystery of
   what has passed in this world for religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I SAW NO TEMPLE THERE

   "I SAW no Church there," said John. Nor is there any note of surprise
   as he marks the omission of what one half of Christendom would have
   considered the first essential. For beside the type of religion he had
   learned from Christ, the Church type --the merely Church type--is an
   elaborate evasion. What have the pomp and circumstance, the fashion and
   the form, the vestures and the postures, to do with Jesus of Nazareth?
   At a stage in personal development. and for a certain type of mind,
   such things may have a place. But when mistaken for Christianity, no
   matter how they aid it, or in what measure they conserve it, they
   defraud the souls of men, and rob humanity of its dues. It is because
   to large masses of people Christianity has become synonymous with a
   Temple service that other large masses of people decline to touch it.
   It is a mistake to suppose that the working classes of this country are
   opposed to Christianity. No man can ever be opposed to Christianity who
   knows what it really is. The working men would still follow Christ if
   He came among them. As a matter of fact they do follow anyone, preacher
   or layman, in pulpit or on platform, who is the least like Him. But
   what they cannot follow, and must evermore live outside of, is a
   worship which ends with the worshipper, a religion expressed only in
   ceremony, and a faith unrelated to life.

   Perhaps the most dismal fact of history is the failure of the great
   organized bodies of ecclesiasticism to understand the simple genius of
   Christ's religion. Whatever the best in the Churches of all time may
   have thought of the life and religion of Christ, taken as a whole they
   have succeeded in leaving upon the mind of a large portion of the world
   an impression of Christianity which is the direct opposite ofthe
   reality. Down to the present hour almost whole nations in Europe live,
   worship, and die under the belief that Christ is an ecclesiastical
   Christ, religion the sum of all the Churches' observances, and faith an
   adhesion to the Churches' creeds. I do not apportion blame; I simply
   record the fact. Everything that thespiritual and temporal authority of
   man could do has been done-- done in ignorance of the true nature of
   Christianity--to dislodge the religion of Christ from its natural home
   in the heart of Humanity. In many lands the Churches have literally
   stolen Christ from the people; they have made the Son of Man the Priest
   of an Order; they have taken Christianity from the City and imprisoned
   it behind altar rails; they have withdrawn it from the national life
   and doled it out to the few who pay to keep the unconscious deception
   up.

   Do not do the Church, the true Church at least, the injustice to think
   that she does not know all this. Nowhere, not even in the fiercest
   secular press, is there more exposure of this danger, more indignation
   at its continuance, than in many of the Churches of to-day. The protest
   against the confusion of Christianity with the Church is the most
   threadbare of pulpit themes. Before the University of Oxford, from the
   pulpit of St. Mary's, these words were lately spoken: "If it is strange
   that the Church of the darker ages should have needed so bitter a
   lesson (the actual demolition of their churches), is it not ten times
   stranger still that the Church of the days of greater enlightenment
   should be found again making the chief part of its business the
   organizing of the modes of worship; that the largest efforts which are
   owned as the efforts of the Church are made for the establishment and
   maintenance of worship; that our chief controversies relate to the
   teaching and the ministry of a system designed primarily, if not
   exclusively, for worship; that even the fancies and the refinements of
   such a system divide us; that thebreach between things secular and
   things religious grows wider instead of their being made to blend into
   one; and that the vast and fruitful spaces of the actual life of
   mankind lie still so largely without the gates? The old Jerusalem was
   all temple. The mediaeval Church was all temple. But the ideal of the
   new Jerusalem was--no temple, but a God-inhabited society. Are we not
   reversing this ideal in an age when the church still means in so many
   mouths the clergy, instead of meaning the Christian society, and when
   nine men are striving to get men to go to church for one who is
   striving to make men realize that they themselves are the Church?"

   Yet even with words so strong as these echoing daily from Protestant
   pulpits the superstition reigns in all but unbroken power. And
   everywhere still men are found confounding the spectacular services of
   a Church, the vicarious religion of a priest, and the traditional
   belief in a creed, with the living religion of the Son of Man.

   "I saw no Temple there"--the future City will be a City without a
   Church. Ponder that fact, realize the temporariness of the Church,
   then--go and build one. Do not imagine, because all this has been said,
   that I mean to depreciate the Church. On the contrary, if it were mine
   to build a City, a City where all life should be religious, and all men
   destined to become members of the Body of Christ, the first stone I
   should lay there would be the foundation-stone of a Church Why?
   Because, among other reasons, the product which the Church on the whole
   best helps to develop, and in the largest quantity, is that which is
   most needed by the City.

   For the present, and for a long time to come, the manufactory of good
   men, the nursery of the forces which are to redeem the City, will in
   the main be found to be some more or less formal, more or less
   imperfect, Christian Church. Here and there an unchurched soul may stir
   the multitudes to lofty deeds; isolated men; strong enough to preserve
   their souls apart from the Church, but shortsighted enough perhaps to
   fail to see that others cannot, may set high examples and stimulate to
   national reforms. But for the rank and file of us, made of such stuff
   as we are made of, the steady pressures of fixed institutions, the
   regular diets of a common worship, and the education of public
   Christian teaching are too obvious safeguards of spiritual culture to
   be set aside. Even Renan declares his conviction that "Beyond the
   family and outside the State, man has need of the Church . . . Civil
   society, whether it calls itself a commune, a canton, or a province, a
   state, or fatherland, has many duties towards the improvement of the
   individual; but what it does is necessarily limited. The family ought
   to do much more, but often it is insufficient; sometimes it is wanting
   altogether. The association created in the name of moral principle can
   alone give to every man coming into this world a bond which unites him
   with the past, duties as to the future, examples to follow, a heritage
   to receive and to transmit, and a tradition of devotion to continue."
   Apart altogether from the quality of its contribution to society, in
   the mere quantity of the work it turns out it stands alone. Even for
   social purposes the Church is by far the greatest Employment Bureau in
   the world. And the man who, seeing whereit falls short, withholds on
   that account hiswitness to its usefulness, is a traitor to history and
   to fact.

   "The Church," as the preacher whom I have already quoted, most truly
   adds, "is a society which tends to embrace the whole life of mankind,
   to bind all their relations together by a Divine sanction. As such, it
   blends naturally with the institutions of common life--those
   institutions which, because they are natural and necessary, are
   therefore Divine. What it aims at is not the recognition by the nation
   of a worshipping body, governed by the ministers of public worship,
   which calls itself the Church, but that the nation and all classes in
   it should act upon Christian principle, that laws should be made in
   Christ's spirit of justice, that the relations of the powers of the
   state should be maintained on a basis of Christian equity, that all
   public acts should be done in Christ's spirit, and with mutual
   forbearance, that the spirit of Christian charity should be spread
   through all ranks and orders of the people. The Church will maintain
   public worship as one of the greatest supports of a Christian public
   life; but it will alwaysremember that the true service is a life of
   devotion to God and man far more than the common utterance of prayer."
   I have said that were it mine to build a City, the first stone I should
   lay there would be the foundation-stone of a Church. But if it were
   mine to preach the first sermon in that Church, I should choose as the
   text, "I saw no Church therein." I should tell the people that the
   great use of the Church is to help men to do without it As the old
   ecclesiastical term has it, Church services are "diets" of worship.
   They are meals. All who are hungry will take them, and, if they are
   wise, regularly. But no workman is paid for his meals. He is paid for
   the work he does in the strength of them. No Christian is paid for
   going to Church. He goes there for a meal, for strength from God and
   from his fellow-worshippers to do the work of life --which is the work
   of Christ. The Church is a Divine institution because it is so very
   human an institution. As a channel of nourishment, as a stimulus to
   holy deeds, as a link with all holy lives, let all men use it, and to
   the utmost of their opportunity. But by all that they know of Christ or
   care for man, let them beware of mistaking its services for
   Christianity. What Church services really express is the want of
   Christianity. And when that which is perfect in Christianity is come,
   all this, as the mere passing stay and scaffolding of struggling souls,
   must vanish away.

   If the masses who never go to Church only knew that the Churches were
   the mute expression of a Christian's wants and not the
   self-advertisement of his sanctity, they would have more respectful
   words for Churches. But they have never learned this. And the result in
   their case of confounding religion with the Church is even more serious
   than in the case of the professing Christian. When they break with the
   Church it means to them a break with all religion. As things are it
   could scarce be otherwise. With the Church in ceaseless evidence before
   their eyes as the acknowledged custodian of Christianity; with actual
   stone and lime in every street representing the place where religion
   dwells; with a professional class moving out and in among them, holding
   in their hands the souls of men, and almost the keys of Heaven--how is
   it possible that those who turn their backs on all this should not feel
   outcast from the Church's God? It is not possible. Without a murmur,
   yet with resultsto themselves most disastrous and pathetic, multitudes
   accept this false dividing-line and number themselves as excommunicate
   from all good. The masses will never return to the Church till its true
   relation to the City is more defined. And they can never have that most
   real life of theirs made religious so long as they rule themselves out
   of court on the ground that they have broken with ecclesiastical forms.
   The life of the masses is the most real of all lives. It is full of
   religious possibilities. Every movement of it and every moment of it
   might become of supreme religious value, might hold a continuous
   spiritual discipline, might perpetuate, and that in most natural ways,
   a moral influence which should pervade all Cities and all States. But
   they must first be taught what Christianity really is, and learn to
   distinguish between religion and the Church. After that, if they be
   taught their lesson well, they will return to honour both.

   Our fathers made much of "meetness" for Heaven. By prayer and fasting,
   by self-examination and meditation they sought to fit themselves "for
   the inheritance of the saints in light." Important beyond measure in
   their fitting place are these exercises of the soul. But whether alone
   they fit men for the inheritance of the saints depends on what a saint
   is. If a saint is a devotee and not a citizen, if Heaven is a cathedral
   and not a City, then these things do fit for Heaven. But if life means
   action, and Heaven service; if spiritual graces are acquired for use
   and not for ornament, then devotional forms have a deeper function. The
   Puritan preachers were wont to tell their people to "practise dying."
   Yes; but what is dying? It is going to a City. And what is required of
   those who would go to a City? The practice of Citizenship--the due
   employment of the unselfish talents, the development of public spirit,
   the payment of the full tax to the great brotherhood, the subordination
   of personal aims to the common good. And where are these to be learned?
   Here; in Cities here. There is no other way to learn them. There is no
   Heaven to those who have not learned them.

   No Church however holy, no priest however earnest, no book however
   sacred, can transfer to any human character the capacities of
   Citizenship--those capacities which in the very nature of things are
   necessities to those who would live in the kingdom of God. The only
   preparation which multitudes seem to make for Heaven is for its
   Judgment Bar. What will they do in its streets? What have they learned
   of Citizenship? What have they practised of love? How like are they to
   its Lord? To "practise dying" is to practise living. Earth is the
   rehearsal for Heaven. The eternal beyond is the eternal here. The
   street-life, the home-life, the business-life, the City-life in all the
   varied range of its activity, are an apprenticeship for the City of
   God. There is no other apprenticeship for it. To know how to serve
   Christ in these is to "practise dying."

   To move among the people on the common street; to meet them in the
   market-place on equal terms; to live among them not as saint or monk,
   but as brother-man with brother-man; to serve God not with form or
   ritual, but in the free impulse of a soul; to bear the burdens of
   society and relieve its needs; to carry on the multitudinous activities
   of the City--social, commercial, political, philanthropic--in Christ's
   spirit and for His ends: this is the religion of the Son of Man, and
   the only meetness for Heaven which has much reality in it.

   No; the Church with all its splendid equipment, the cloister with all
   its holy opportunity, are not the final instruments for fitting men for
   Heaven. The City, in many of its functions, is a greater Church than
   the Church. It is amid the whirr of its machinery and in the discipline
   of its life that the souls of men are really made. How great its
   opportunity is we are few of us aware. It is such slow work getting
   better, the daily round is so very common, our ideas of a heavenly life
   are so unreal and mystical that even when the highest Heaven lies all
   around us, when we might touch it, and dwell in it every day we live,
   we almost fail to see that it is there. The Heaven of our childhood,
   the spectacular Heaven, the Heaven which is a place, sodominates
   thought even in our maturer years, that we are slow to learn the fuller
   truth that Heaven is a state. But John, who is responsible before all
   other teachers for the dramatic view of Heaven, has not failed in this
   very allegory to proclaim the further lesson. Having brought all his
   scenery upon the stage and pictured a material Heaven of almost
   unimaginable splendour, the seer turns aside before he closes for a
   revelation of a profounder kind. Within the Heavenly City he opens the
   gate of an inner Heaven. It is the spiritual Heaven--the Heaven of
   those who serve. With two flashes of his pen he tells the Citizens of
   God all that they will ever need or care to know as to what Heaven
   really means. "His servants shall serve Him; and they shall see His
   Face; and His Character shall be written on their characters."

   They shall see His Face. Where? In the City. When? In Eternity? No;
   to-morrow. Those who serve in any City cannot help continually seeing
   Christ. He is there with them. He is there before them. They cannot but
   meet. No gentle word is ever spoken that Christ's voice does not also
   speak; no meek deed is ever done that the unsummoned Vision does not
   there and then appear. Whoso, in whatsoever place, receiveth a little
   child in My name receiveth Me.

   This is how men get to know God--by doing His will. And there is no
   other way. And this is how men become like God; how God's character
   becomes written upon men's characters. Acts react upon souls. Good acts
   make good men; just acts, just men; kind acts, kind men; divine acts,
   divine men. And there is no other way of becoming good, just, kind,
   divine. And there is no Heaven for those who have not become these. For
   these are Heaven.

   When John's Heaven faded from his sight, and the prophet woke to the
   desert waste of Patmos, did he grudge to exchange the Heaven of his
   dream for the common tasks around him? Was he not glad to be alive, and
   there? And would he not straightway go to the City, to whatever
   struggling multitude his prison-rock held, if so be that he might prove
   his dream and among them see His Face? Traveller to God's last City, be
   glad that you are alive. Be thankful for the City at your door and for
   the chance to build its walls a little nearer Heaven before you go.
   Pray for yet a little while to redeem the wasted years. And week by
   week as you go forth from worship, and day by day as you awake to face
   this great and needy world, learn to "seek a City" there, and in the
   service of its neediest citizen find Heaven.

  THE CHANGED LIFE

   "I PROTEST that if some great power would agree to make me always think
   what is true and do what is right, on condition of being turned into a
   sort of clock and wound up every morning, I should instantly close with
   the offer."

   These are the words of Mr. Huxley. The infinite desirability, the
   infinite difficulty of being good--the theme is as old as humanity. The
   man does not live from whose deeper being the same confession has not
   risen, or who would not give his all tomorrow, if he could "close with
   the offer" of becoming a better man.

   I propose to make that offer now. In all seriousness, without being
   "turned into a sort of clock," the end can be attained. Under the right
   conditions it is as natural for character to become beautiful as for a
   flower; and if on God's earth, there is not some machinery for
   effecting it, the supreme gift to the world has been forgotten. This is
   simply what man was made for. With Browning: "I say that Man was made
   to grow, not stop." Or in the deeper words of an older Book: "Whom He
   did foreknow, He also did predestinate . . . to be conformed to the
   Image of his Son."

   Let me begin by naming, and in part discarding, some processes in vogue
   already, for producing better lives. These processes are far from
   wrong; in their place they may even be essential. One ventures to
   disparage them only because they do not turn out the most perfect
   possible work.

   The first imperfect method is to rely on Resolution. In will-power, in
   mere spasms of earnestness there is no salvation. Struggle, effort,
   even agony, have their place in Christianity as we shall see; but this
   is not where they come in. In mid-Atlantic the other day, the Etruria
   in which I was sailing, suddenly stopped. Something had gone wrong with
   the engines. There were five hundred able-bodied men on board the ship.
   Do you think if we had gathered together and pushed against the masts
   we could have pushed it on? When one attempts to sanctify himself by
   effort, he is trying to make his boat go by pushing against the mast.
   He is like a drowning man trying to lift himself out of the water by
   pulling at the hair of his own head. Christ held up this method almost
   to ridicule when He said, "Which of you by taking thought can add a
   cubit to his stature?" The one redeeming feature of the self-sufficient
   method is this--that those who try it find out almost at once that it
   will not gain the goal.

   Another experimenter says:--"But that is not my method. I have seen the
   folly of a mere wild struggle in the dark. I work on a principle. My
   plan is not to waste power on random effort, but to concentrate on a
   single sin. By taking one at a time and crucifying it steadily, I hope
   in the end to extirpate all." To this, unfortunately, there are four
   objections. For one thing life is too short; the name of sin is Legion.
   For another thing, to deal with individual sins is to leave the rest of
   the nature for the time untouched. In the third place, a single combat
   with a special sin does not affect the root and spring of the disease.
   If one only of the channels of sin be obstructed, experience points to
   an almost certain overflow through some other part of the nature.
   Partial conversion is almost always accompanied by such moral leakage,
   for the pent-up energies accumulate to the bursting point, and the last
   state of that soul may be worse than the first. In the last place,
   religion does not consist in negatives, in stopping this sin and
   stopping that. The perfect character can never be produced with a
   pruning knife.

   But a Third protests:-- "So be it I make no attempt to stop sins one by
   one. My method is just the opposite. I copy the virtues one by one."
   The difficulty about the copying method is that it is apt to be
   mechanical. One can always tell an engraving from a picture, an
   artificial flower from a real flower. To copy virtues one by one has
   somewhat the same effect as eradicating the vices one by one; the
   temporary result is an overbalanced and incongruous character. Someone
   defines a prig as "a creature that is over-fed for its size." One
   sometimes finds Christians of this species-- over-fed on one side of
   their nature, but dismally thin and starved-looking on the other. The
   result, for instance, of copying Humility, and adding it on to an
   otherwise worldly life, is simply grotesque. A rabid Temperance
   advocate, for the same reason, is often the poorest of creatures,
   flourishing on a single virtue, and quite oblivious that his Temperance
   is making a worse man of him and not a better. These are examplesof
   fine virtues spoiled by association with mean companions. Character is
   a unity, and all the virtues must advance together to make the perfect
   man. This method of sanctification, nevertheless, is in the true
   direction. It is only in the details of execution that it fails.

   A fourth method I need scarcely mention, for it is a variation on those
   already named. It is the very young man's method; and the pure
   earnestness of it makes it almost desecration to touch it. It is to
   keep a private note-book with columns for the days of the week, and a
   list of virtues with spaces against each for marks. This, with many
   stern rules for preface, is stored away in a secret place, and from
   time to time, at nightfall, the soul is arraigned before it as before a
   private judgment bar. This living by code was Franklin's method; and I
   suppose thousands more could tell how they had hung up in their
   bed-rooms, or hid in lock-fast drawers, the rules which one solemn day
   they drew up to shape their lives. This method is not erroneous, only
   somehow its success is poor. You bear me witness that it fails? And it
   fails generally for very matter-of-fact reasons--most likely because
   one day we forget the rules.

   All these methods that have been named --the self-sufficient method,
   the self-crucifixion method, the mimetic method, and the diary
   method--are perfectly human, perfectly natural, perfectly ignorant,
   and, as they stand, perfectly inadequate. It is not argued, I repeat,
   that they must be abandoned. Their harm is rather that they distract
   attention from the true working method, and secure a fair result at the
   expense of the perfect one. What that perfect method is we shall now go
   on to ask.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FORMULA OF SANCTIFICATION

   A FORMULA, a receipt, for Sanctification-- can one seriously speak of
   this mighty change as if the process were as definite as for the
   production of so many volts of electricity? It is impossible to doubt
   it. Shall a mechanical experiment succeed infallibly, and the one vital
   experiment of humanity remain a chance? Is corn to grow by method, and
   character by caprice? If we cannot calculate to a certainty that the
   forces of religion will do their work, then is religion vain. And if we
   cannot express the law of these forces in simple words, then is
   Christianity not the world's religion but the world's conundrum.

   Where, then, shall one look for such a formula? Where one would look
   for any formula--among the text books. And if we turn to the text books
   of Christianity we shall find a formula for this problem as clear and
   precise as any in the mechanical sciences. If this simple rule,
   moreover, be but followed fearlessly, it will yield the result of a
   perfect character as surely as any result that is guaranteed by the
   laws of nature. The finest expression of this rule in Scripture, or
   indeed in any literature, is probably one drawn up and condensed into a
   single verse by Paul. You will find it in a letter--the second to the
   Corinthians--written by him to some Christian people who, in a city
   which was a byword for depravity and licentiousness, were seeking the
   higher life. To see the pointof the words we must take them from the
   immensely improved rendering of the Revised translation, for the older
   Version in this case greatly obscures the sense. They are these: "We
   all, with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord,
   are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from
   the Lord the Spirit."

   Now observe at the outset the entire contradiction of all our previous
   efforts, in the simple passive "we are transformed." We are changed, as
   the Old Version has it--we do not change ourselves. No man can change
   himself. Throughout the New Testament you will find that wherever these
   moral and spiritual transformations are described the verbs are in the
   passive. Presently it will be pointed out that there is arationale in
   this; but meantime do not toss these words aside as if this passivity
   denied all human effort or ignored intelligible law. What is implied
   for the soul here is no more than is everywhere claimed for the body.
   In physiology the verbs describing the processes of growth are in the
   passive. Growth is not voluntary; it takes place, it happens, it is
   wrought upon matter. So here. "Ye must be born again" --we cannot born
   ourselves. "Be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed"--we
   are subjects to a transforming influence, we do not transform
   ourselves. Not more certain is it that it is something outside the
   thermometer that produces a change in the thermometer, than it is
   something outside the soul of man that produces a moral change upon
   him. That he must be susceptible to that change, that he must be a
   party to it, goes without saying; but that neither his aptitude nor his
   will can produce it, is equally certain.

   Obvious as it ought to seem, this may be to some an almost startling
   revelation. The change we have been striving after is not to be
   produced by any more striving after. It is to be wrought upon us by the
   moulding of hands beyond our own. As the branch ascends, and the bud
   bursts, and the fruit reddens under the co-operation of influences from
   the outside air, so man rises to the higher stature under invisible
   pressures from without. The radical defect of all our former methods of
   sanctification was the attempt to generate from within that which can
   only be wrought upon us from without. According to the first Law of
   Motion: Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion
   in a straight line, except in so far as it may be compelled by
   impressed forces to change that state. This is also a first law of
   Christianity. Every man's character remains as it is, or continues in
   the direction in which it is going, until it is compelled by impressed
   forces to change that state. Our failure has been the failure to put
   ourselves in the way of the impressed forces. There is a clay, and
   there is a Potter; we have tried to get the clay to mould the clay.

   Whence, then, these pressures, and where this Potter? The answer of the
   formula is "By reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord we are
   changed." But this is not very clear. What is the "glory" of the Lord,
   and how can mortal man reflect it, and how can that act as an
   "impressed force" in moulding him to a nobler form? The word "glory"
   --the word which has to bear the weight of holding those "impressed
   forces" --is a stranger in current speech, and our first duty is to
   seek out its equivalent in working English. It suggests at first a
   radiance of some kind, something dazzling or glittering, some halo such
   as the old masters loved to paint round the heads of their Ecce Homos.
   But that is paint, mere matter, the visible symbol of some unseen
   thing. What is that unseen thing? It is that of all unseen things, the
   most radiant, the most beautiful, the most Divine, and that is
   Character. On earth, in Heaven, there is nothing so great, so glorious
   as this. The word has many meanings; in ethics it can have but one.
   Glory is character and nothing less, and it can be nothing more. The
   earth is "full of the Glory of the Lord," because it is full of His
   character. The "Beauty of the Lord" is character. "The effulgence of
   His Glory" is character. "The Glory of the Only Begotten" is character,
   the character which is "fulness of grace and truth." And when God told
   His people His name He simply gave them His character, His character
   which was Himself. "And the Lord proclaimed the Name of the Lord . . .
   the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and
   abundant in goodness and truth." Glory then is not something
   intangible, or ghostly, or transcendental. If it were this, how could
   Paul ask men to reflect it? Stripped of its physical enswathement it is
   Beauty, moral and spiritual Beauty, Beauty infinitely real, infinitely
   exalted, yet infinitely near and infinitely communicable.

   With this explanation read over the sentence once more in paraphrase:
   We all reflecting as a mirror the character of Christ are transformed
   into the same Image from character to character--from a poor character
   to a better one, from a better one to ane a little better still, from
   that to one still more complete, until by slow degrees the Perfect
   Image is attained. Here the solution of the problem of sanctification
   is compressed into a sentence: Reflect the character of Christ and you
   will become like Christ.

   All men are mirrors--that is the first law on which this formula is
   based. One of the aptest descriptions of a human being is that he is a
   mirror. As we sat at table to-night, the world in which each of us
   lived and moved throughout this day was focussed in the room. What we
   saw as we looked at one another was not one another, but one mother's
   world. We were an arrangement of mirrors. The scenes we saw were all
   reproduced; the people we met walked to and fro; they spoke, they
   bowed, they passed us by, did everything over again as if it had been
   real. When we talked, we were but looking at our own mirror and
   describing what flitted across it; our listening was not hearing, but
   seeing--we but looked on our neighbour's mirror. All human intercourse
   is a seeing of reflections. I meet a stranger in a railway carriage.
   The cadence of his first word tells me he is English, and comes from
   Yorkshire. Without knowing it he has reflected his birthplace, his
   parents, and the long history of their race. Even physiologically he is
   a mirror. His second sentence records that he is a politician, and a
   faint inflexion in the way he pronounces The Times reveals his party.
   In his next remarks I see reflected a whole world of experiences. The
   books he has read, the people he has met, the influences that have
   played upon him and made him the man he is-- these are all registered
   there by a pen which lets nothing pass, and whose writing can never be
   blotted out. What I am reading in him meantime he also is reading in
   me; and before the journey is over we could half write each other's
   lives. Whether we like it or not, we live in glass houses. The mind,
   the memory, the soul, is simply a vast chamber panelled with
   looking-glass. And upon this miraculous arrangement and endowment
   depends the capacity of mortal souls to "reflect the character of the
   Lord."

   But this is not all. If all these varied reflections from our so-called
   secret life are patent to the world, how close the writing, how
   complete the record, within the soul itself? For the influences we meet
   are not simply held for a moment on the polished surface and thrown off
   again into space. Each is retained where first it fell, and stored up
   in the soul for ever.

   This law of Assimilation is the second, and by far the most impressive
   truth which underlies the formula of sanctification--the truth that men
   are not only mirrors, but that these mirrors so far from being mere
   reflectors of the fleeting things they see, transfer into their own
   inmost substance, and hold in permanent preservation the things that
   they reflect. No one knows how the soul can hold these things. No one
   knows how the miracle is done. No phenomenon in nature, no process in
   chemistry, no chapter in necromancy can even help us to begin to
   understand this amazing operation. For, think of it, the past is not
   only focussed there, in a man's soul, it is there. How could it be
   reflected from there if it were not there? All things that he has ever
   seen, known, felt, believed of the surrounding world are now within
   him, have become part of him, in part are him--he has been changed into
   their image. He may deny it, he may resent it, but they are there. They
   do not adhere to him, they are transfused through him. He cannot alter
   or rub them out. They are not in his memory, they are in him. His soul
   is as they have filled it, made it, left it. These things, these books,
   these events, these influences are his makers. In their hands are life
   and death, beauty and deformity. When once the image or likeness of any
   of these is fairly presented to the soul, no power on earth can hinder
   two things happening--it must be absorbed into the soul, and for ever
   reflected back again from character.

   Upon these astounding yet perfectly obvious psychological facts, Paul
   bases his doctrine of sanctification. He sees that character is a thing
   built up by slow degrees, that it is hourly changing for better or for
   worse according to the images which flit across it. One step further
   and the whole length andbreadth of the application of these ideas to
   the central problem of religion will stand before us.

  THE ALCHEMY OF INFLUENCE

   IF events change men, much more persons. No man can meet another on the
   street without making some mark upon him. We say we exchange words when
   we meet; what we exchange is souls. And when intercourse is very close
   and very frequent, so complete is this exchange that recognisable bits
   of the one soul begin to show in the other's nature, and the second is
   conscious of a similar and growing debt to the first. This mysterious
   approximating of two souls who has not witnessed? Who has not watched
   some old couple come down life's pilgrimage hand in hand with such
   gentle trust and joy in one another that their very faces wore the
   self-same look? These were not two souls; it was a composite soul. It
   did not matter to which of the two you spoke, you would have said the
   same words to either. It was quite indifferent which replied, each
   would have said the same. Half a century's reflecting had told upon
   them: they were changed into the same image. It is the Law of Influence
   that we become like those whom we habitually admire: these had become
   like because they habitually admired. Through all the range of
   literature, of history, and biography this law presides. Men are all
   mosaics of other men. There was a savour of David aboutJonathan and a
   savour of Jonathan about David. Jean Valjean, in the masterpiece of
   Victor Hugo, is Bishop Bienvenu risen fromthe dead. Metempsychosis is a
   fact. George Eliot's message to the world was that men and women make
   men and women. The Family, the cradle of mankind, has no meaning apart
   from this. Society itself is nothing but a rallying point for these
   omnipotent forces to do their work. On the doctrine of Influence, in
   short, the whole vast pyramid of humanity is built.

   But it was reserved for Paul to make the supreme application of the Law
   of Influence. It was a tremendous inference to make, but he never
   hesitated. He himself was a changed man: he knew exactly what had done
   it; it was Christ On the Damascus road they met, and from that hour his
   life was absorbed in His. The effect could not but follow--on words, on
   deeds, on career, on creed. The "impressed forces" did their vital
   work. He became like Him whom he habitually loved. "So we all," he
   writes, "reflecting as a mirror the glory of Christ are changed into
   the same image."

   Nothing could be more simple, more intelligible, more natural, more
   supernatural. It is an analogy from an everyday fact Since we are what
   we are by the impacts of those who surround us, those who surround
   themselves with the highest will be those who change into the highest.
   There are some men and some women in whose company we are always at our
   best. While with them we cannot think mean thoughts or speak ungenerous
   words. Their mere presence is elevation, purification, sanctity. All
   the best stops in our nature are drawn out by their intercourse, and we
   find a music in our souls that was never there before. Suppose even
   that influence prolonged through a month, a year, a lifetime, and what
   could not lifebecome? Here, even on the common plane of life, talking
   our language, walking our streets, working side by side, are
   sanctifiers of souls; here, breathing through common play, is Heaven;
   here, energies charged even through a temporal medium with a virtue of
   regeneration. If to live with men, diluted to the millionth degree with
   the virtue of the Highest, can exalt and purify the nature, what bounds
   can be set to the influence of Christ? To live with Socrates--with
   unveiled face--must have made one wise; with Aristides, just. Francis
   of Assisi must have made one gentle; Savonarola, strong. But to have
   lived with Christ? To have lived with Christ must have made one like
   Christ; that is to say, A Christian.

   As a matter of fact, to live with Christ did produce this effect. It
   produced it in the case of Paul. And during Christ's lifetime the
   experiment was tried in an even more startling form. A few raw,
   unspiritual, uninspiring men, were admitted to the inner circle of His
   friendship. The change began at once. Day by day we can almost see the
   first disciples grow. First there steals over them the faintest
   possible adumbration of His character, and occasionally, very
   occasionally, they do a thing, or say a thing that they could not have
   done or said had they not been living there. Slowly the spell of His
   Life deepens. Reach after reach of their nature is overtaken, thawed,
   subjugated, sanctified. Their manners soften, their words become more
   gentle, their conduct more unselfish As swallows who have found a
   summer, as frozen buds the spring, their starved humanity bursts into a
   fuller life. They do not know how it is, but they are different men.
   One day they find themselves like their Master, going about and doing
   good. To themselves it is unaccountable, but they cannot do otherwise.
   They were not told to do it, it came to them to do it. But the people
   who watch them know well how to account for it--"They have been," they
   whisper, "with Jesus." Already even, the mark and seal of His character
   is upon them-- "They have been with Jesus." Unparalleled phenomenon,
   that these poor fishermen should remind other men of Christ! Stupendous
   victory and mystery of regeneration that mortal men should suggest to
   the world, God!

   There is something almost melting in the way His contemporaries, and
   John especially, speak of the Influence of Christ. John lived himself
   in daily wonder at Him; he was overpowered, overawed, entranced,
   transfigured. To his mind it was impossible for any one to come under
   this influence and ever be the same again. "Whosoever abideth in Him
   sinneth not," he said. It was inconceivable that he should sin, as
   inconceivable as that ice should live in a burning sun, or darkness
   co-exist with noon. If any one did sin, it was to John the simple proof
   that he could never have met Christ. "Whosoever sinneth," he exclaims,
   "hath not seen Him, neither known Him." Sin was abashed in this
   Presence. Its roots withered. Its sway and victory were for ever at an
   end.

   But these were His contemporaries. It was easy for them to be
   influenced by Him, for they were every day and all the day together.
   But how can we mirror that which we have never seen? How can all this
   stupendous result be produced by a Memory, by the scantiest of all
   Biographies, by One who lived and left this earth eighteen hundred
   years ago? How can modern men to-day make Christ, the absent Christ,
   their most constant companion still? The answer is that Friendship is a
   spiritual thing. It is independent of Matter, or Space, or Time. That
   which I love in my friend is not that which I see. What influences me
   in my friend is not his body but his spirit. It would have been an
   ineffable experience truly to have lived at that time--


   "I think when I read the sweet story of old,

   How when Jesus was here among men,

   He took little children like lambs to His fold,

   I should like to have been with him then.


   "I wish that His hand had been laid on my head,

   That His arms had been thrown around me,

   And that I had seen His kind look when He said,

   Let the little ones come unto Me."

   And yet, if Christ were to come into the world again few of us probably
   would ever have a chance of seeing Him. Millions of her subjects, in
   this little country, have never seen their own Queen. And there would
   be millions of the subjects of Christ who could never get within
   speaking distance of Him if He were here. Our companionship with Him,
   like all true companionship, is a spiritual communion. All friendship,
   all love, human and Divine, is purely spiritual. It was after He was
   risen that He influenced even the disciples most. Hence in reflecting
   the character of Christ it is no real obstacle that we may never have
   been in visible contact with Himself.

   There lived once a young girl whose perfect grace of character was the
   wonder of those who knew her. She wore on her neck a gold locket which
   no one was ever allowed to open. One day, in a moment of unusual
   confidence, one of her companions was allowed to touch its spring and
   learn its secret. She saw written these words-- "Whom having not seen,
   I love." That was the secret of her beautiful life. She had been
   changed into the Same Image.

   Now this is not imitation, but a much deeper thing. Mark this
   distinction. For the difference in the process, as well as in the
   result, may be as great as that between a photograph secured by the
   infallible pencil of the sun, and the rude outline from a schoolboy's
   chalk. Imitation is mechanical, reflection organic. The one is
   occasional, the other habitual. In the one case, man comes to God and
   imitates Him; in the other, God comes to man and imprints Himself upon
   him. It is quite true that there is an imitation of Christ which
   amounts to reflection. But Paul's term includes all that the other
   holds, and is open to no mistake.

   "Make Christ your most constant companion"--this is what it practically
   means for us. Be more under His influence than under any other
   influence. Ten minutes spent in His society every day, ay, two minutes
   if it be face to face, and heart to heart, will make the whole day
   different. Every character has an inward spring, let Christ be it.
   Every action has a key-note, let Christ set it. Yesterday you got a
   certain letter. You sat down and wrote a reply which almost scorched
   the paper. You picked the cruellest adjectives you knew and sent it
   forth, without a pang, to do its ruthless work. You did that because
   your life was set in the wrong key. You began the day with the mirror
   placed at the wrong angle. To-morrow, at daybreak, turn it towards Him,
   and even to your enemy the fashion of your countenance will be changed.
   Whatever you then do, one thing you will find you could not do--you
   could not write that letter. Your first impulse may be the same, your
   judgment may be unchanged, but if you try it the ink will dry on your
   pen, and you will rise from your desk an unavenged but a greater and
   more Christian man. Throughout the whole day your actions, down to the
   last detail, will do homage to that early vision. Yesterday you thought
   mostly about yourself. To-day the poor will meet you, and you will feed
   them. The helpless, the tempted, the sad, will throng about you, and
   each you will befriend. Where were all these people yesterday? Where
   they are to-day, but you did not see them. It is in reflected light
   that the poor are seen. But your soul to-day is not at the ordinary
   angle. "Things which are not seen" are visible. For a few short hours
   you live the Eternal Life. The eternal life, the life of faith, is
   simply the life of the higher vision. Faith is an attitude-- a mirror
   set at the right angle.

   When to-morrow is over, and in the evening you review it, you will
   wonder how you did it. You will not be conscious that you strove for
   anything, or imitated anything, or crucified anything. You will be
   conscious of Christ; that He was with you, that without compulsion you
   were yet compelled, that without force, or noise, or proclamation, the
   revolution was accomplished. You do not congratulate yourself as one
   who has done a mighty deed, or achieved a personal success, or stored
   up a fund of "Christian experience" to ensure the same result again.
   What you are conscious of is "the glory of the Lord." And what the
   world is conscious of, if the result be a true one, is also "the glory
   of the Lord." In looking at a mirror one does not see the mirror, or
   think of it, but only of what it reflects. For a mirror never calls
   attention to itself except when there are flaws in it.

   That this is a real experience and not a vision, that this life is
   possible to men, is being lived by men to-day, is simple biographical
   fact. From a thousand witnesses I cannot forbear to summon one. The
   following are the words of one of the highest intellects this age has
   known, a man who shared the burdens of his country as few have done,
   and who, not in the shadows of old age, but in the high noon of his
   success, gave this confession--I quote it with only a few
   abridgments--to the world:--

   I want to speak to-night only a little, but that little I desire to
   speak of the sacred name of Christ, who is my life, my inspiration, my
   hope, and my surety. I cannot help stopping and looking back upon the
   past. And I wish, as if I had never done it before, to bear witness,
   not only that it is by the grace of God, but that it is by the grace of
   God as manifested in Christ Jesus, that I am what I am. I recognize the
   sublimity and grandeur of the revelation of God in His eternal
   fatherhood as one that made the heavens, that founded the earth, and
   that regards all the tribes of the earth, comprehending them in one
   universal mercy; but it is the God that is manifested in Jesus Christ,
   revealed by His life, made known by the inflections of His feelings, by
   His discourse, and by His deeds--it is that God that I desire to
   confess to-night, and of whom I desire to say, "By the love of God in
   Christ Jesus I am what I am."

   If you ask me precisely what I mean by that, I say, frankly, that more
   than any recognized influence of my father or my mother upon me; more
   than the social influence of all the members of my father's household;
   more, so far as I can trace it, or so far as I am made aware of it,
   than all the social influences of every kind, Christ has had the
   formation of my mind and my disposition. My hidden ideals of what is
   beautiful I have drawn from Christ. My thoughts of what is manly, and
   noble, and pure, have almost all of them arisen from the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Many men have educated themselves by reading Plutarch's Lives
   of the Ancient Worthies, and setting before themselves one and another
   of these that in different ages have achieved celebrity; and they have
   recognized the great power of these men on themselves. Now I do not
   perceive that poet, or philosopher, or reformer, or general, or any
   other great man, ever has dwelt in my imagination and in my thought as
   the simple Jesus has. For more than twenty-five years I instinctively
   have gone to Christ to draw a measure and a rule for everything.
   Whenever there has been a necessity for it, I have sought--and at last
   almost spontaneously--to throw myself into the companionship of Christ;
   and early, by my imagination, I could see Him standing and looking
   quietly and lovingly upon me. There seemed almost to drop from His face
   an influence upon me that suggested what was the right thing in the
   controlling of passion, in the subduing of pride, in the overcoming of
   selfishness; and it is from Christ, manifested to my inward eye, that I
   have consciously derived more ideals, more models, more influences,
   than from any human character whatever.

   That is not all. I feel conscious that I have derived from the Lord
   Jesus Christ every thought that makes heaven a reality to me, and every
   thought that paves the road that lies between me and heaven. All my
   conceptions of the progress of grace in the soul; all the steps by
   which divine life is evolved; all the ideals that overhang the blessed
   sphere which awaits us beyond this world --these are derived from the
   Saviour. The life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of
   the Son of God.

   That is not all. Much as my future includes all these elements which go
   to make the blessed fabric of earthly life, yet, after all, what the
   summer is compared with all its earthly products --flowers, and leaves,
   and grass--that is Christ compared with all the products of Christ in
   my mind and in my soul. All the flowers and leaves of sympathy; all the
   twining joys that come from my heart as a Christian--these I take and
   hold in the future, but they are to me what the flowers and leaves of
   summer are compared with the sun that makes the summer. Christ is the
   Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end of my better life.

   When I read the Bible, I gather a great deal from the Old Testament,
   and from the Pauline portions of the New Testament; but after all, I am
   conscious that the fruit of the Bible is Christ. That is what I read it
   for, and that is what I find that is worth reading. I have had a hunger
   to be loved of Christ. You all know, in some relations, what it is to
   be hungry for love. Your heart seems unsatisfied till you can draw
   something more toward you from those that are dearest to you. There
   have been times when I have had an unspeakable heart-hunger for
   Christ's love. My sense of sin is never strong when I think of the law;
   my sense of sin is strong when I think of love--if there is any
   difference between law and love. It is when drawing near the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and longing to be loved, that I have the most vivid sense of
   unsymmetry, of imperfection, of absolute unworthiness, and of my
   sinfulness. Character and conduct are never so vividly set before me as
   when in silence I bend in the presence of Christ, revealed not in
   wrath, but in love to me. I never so much long to be lovely, that I may
   be loved, as when I have this revelation of Christ before my mind.

   In looking back upon my experience, that part of my life which stands
   out, and which I remember most vividly, is just that part that has had
   some conscious association with Christ. All the rest is pale, and thin,
   and lies like clouds on the horizon. Doctrines, systems, measures,
   methods-- what may be called the necessary mechanical and external part
   of worship; the part which the senses would recognize--this seems to
   have withered and fallen off like leaves of last summer; but that part
   which has taken hold of Christ abides'

   Can anyone hear this life-music, with its throbbing refrain of Christ,
   and remain unmoved by envy or desire? Yet till we have lived like this
   we have never lived at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIRST EXPERIMENT

   THEN you reduce religion to a common Friendship? A common
   Friendship--Who talks of a common Friendship? There is no such thing in
   the world. On earth no word is more sublime. Friendship is the nearest
   thing we know to what religion is. God is love. And to make religion
   akin to Friendship is simply to give it the highest expression
   conceivable by man. But if by demurring to "a common friendship" is
   meant a protest against the greatest and the holiest in religion being
   spoken of in intelligible terms, then I am afraid the objection is all
   too real. Men always look for a mystery when one talks of
   sanctification; some mystery apart from that which must ever be
   mysterious wherever Spirit works. It is thought some peculiar secret
   lies behind it, some occult experience which only the initiated know.
   Thousands of persons go to church every Sunday hoping to solve this
   mystery. At meetings, at conferences, many a time they have reached
   what they thought was the very brink of it, but somehow no further
   revelation came. Poring over religious books, how often were they not
   within a paragraph of it; the next page, the next sentence, would
   discover all, and they would be borne on a flowing tide for ever. But
   nothing happened. The next sentence and the next page were read, and
   still it eluded them; and though the promise of its coming kept
   faithfully up to the end, the last chapter found them still pursuing.
   Why did nothing happen? Because there was nothing to happen--nothing of
   the kind they were looking for. Why did it elude them? Because there
   was no "it" When shall we learn that the pursuit of holiness is simply
   the pursuit of Christ? When shall we substitute for the "it" of a
   fictitious aspiration, the approach to a Living Friend? Sanctity is in
   character and not in moods; Divinity in our own plain calm humanity,
   and in no mystic rapture of the soul.

   And yet there are others who, for exactly a contrary reason, will find
   scant satisfaction here. Their complaint is not that a religion
   expressed in terms of Friendship is too homely, but that it is still
   too mystical. To "abide" in Christ, to "make Christ our most constant
   companion" is to them the purest mysticism. They want something
   absolutely tangible and absolutely direct. These are not the poetical
   souls who seek a sign, a mysticism in excess; but the prosaic natures
   whose want is mathematical definition in details. Yet it is perhaps not
   possible to reduce this problem to much more rigid elements. The beauty
   of Friendship is its infinity, One can never evacuate life of
   mysticism. Home is full of it, love is full of it, religion is full of
   it. Why stumble at that in the relation of man to Christ which is
   natural in the relation of man to man?

   If any one cannot conceive or realize a mystical relation with Christ,
   perhaps all that can be done is to help him to step on to it by still
   plainer analogies from common life. How do I know Shakespeare or Dante?
   By communing with their words and thoughts. Many men know Dante better
   than their own fathers. He influences them more. As a spiritual
   presence he is more near to them, as a spiritual force more real. Is
   there any reason why a greater than Shakespeare or Dante, who also
   walked this earth, who left great words behind Him, who has great works
   everywhere in the world now, should not also instruct, inspire, and
   mould the characters of men? I do not limit Christ's influence to this.
   It is this, and it is more. But Christ, so far from resenting or
   discouraging this relation of Friendship, Himself proposed it. "Abide
   in Me" was almost His last word to the world. And He partly met the
   difficulty of those who feel its intangibleness by adding the practical
   clause, "If ye abide in Me and My words abide in you."

   Begin with His words. Words can scarcely ever be long impersonal.
   Christ Himself was a Word, a word made Flesh. Make His words flesh; do
   them, live them, and you must live Christ. "He that keepeth My
   commandments, he it is that loveth Me." Obey Him and you must love Him.
   Abide in Him and you must obey Him. Cultivate His Friendship. Live
   after Christ, in His Spirit, as in His Presence, and it is difficult to
   think what more you can do. Take this at least as a first lesson, as
   introduction. If you cannot at once and always feel the play of His
   life upon yours, watch for it also indirectly. "The whole earth is full
   of the character of the Lord." Christ is the Light of the world, and
   much of His Light is reflected from things in the world--even from
   clouds. Sunlight is stored in every leaf, from leaf through coal, and
   it comforts us thence when days are dark and we cannot see the sun.
   Christ shines through men, through books, through history, through
   nature, music, art. Look for Him there. "Every day one should either
   look at a beautiful picture, or hear beautiful music, or read a
   beautiful poem." The real danger of mysticism is not making it broad
   enough.

   Do not think that nothing is happening because you do not see yourself
   grow, or hear the whirr of the machinery. All great things grow
   noiselessly. You can see a mushroom grow, but never a child. Mr. Darwin
   tells us that Evolution proceeds by "numerous, successive, and slight
   modifications." Paul knew that, and put it, only in more beautiful
   words, into the heart of his formula. He said for the comforting of all
   slowly perfecting souls that they grew "from character to character."
   "The inward man" he says elsewhere, "is renewed from day to day." All
   thorough work is slow; all true development by minute slight and
   insensible metamorphoses. The higher the structure, moreover, the
   slower the progress. As the biologist runs his eye over the long Ascent
   of Life he sees the lowest forms of animals develop in an hour; the
   next above these reach maturity in a day; thosehigher still take weeks
   or months to perfect; but the few at the top demand the long experiment
   of years. If a child and an ape are born on the same day the last will
   be in full possession of its faculties and doing the active work of
   life before the child has left its cradle. Life is the cradle of
   eternity. As the man is to the animal in the slowness of his evolution,
   so is the spiritual man to the natural man. Foundations which have to
   bear the weight of an eternal life must be surely laid. Character is to
   wear for ever; who will wonder or grudge that it cannot be developed in
   a day?

   To await the growing of a soul, nevertheless, is an almost Divine act
   of faith. How pardonable, surely, the impatience of deformity with
   itself, of a consciously despicable character standing before Christ,
   wondering, yearning, hungering to be like that? Yet must one trust the
   process fearlessly, and without misgiving. "The Lord the Spirit" will
   do His part. The tempting expedient is, in haste for abrupt or visible
   progress, to try some method less spiritual, or to defeat the end by
   watching for effects instead of keeping the eye on the Cause. A
   photograph prints from the negative only while exposed to the sun.
   While the artist is looking to see how it is getting on he simply stops
   the getting on. Whatever of wise supervision the soul may need, it is
   certain it can never be over-exposed, or, that, being exposed, anything
   else in the world can improve the result or quicken it. The creation of
   a new heart, the renewing of a right spirit is an omnipotent work of
   God. Leave it to the Creator. "He which hath begun a good work in you
   will perfect it unto that day."

   No man, nevertheless, who feels the worth and solemnity of what is at
   stake will be careless as to his progress. To become like Christ is the
   only thing in the world worth caring for, the thing before which every
   ambition of man is folly, and all lower achievement vain. Those only
   who make this quest the supreme desire and passion of their lives can
   even begin to hope to reach it. If, therefore, it has seemed up to this
   point as if all depended on passivity, let me now assert, with
   conviction more intense, that all depends on activity. A religion of
   effortless adoration may be a religion for an angel but never for a
   man. Not in the contemplative, but in the active lies true hope; not in
   rapture, but in reality lies true life; not in the realm of ideals but
   among tangible things is man's sanctification wrought. Resolution,
   effort, pain, self-crucifixion, agony--all the things already dismissed
   as futile in themselves must now be restored to office, and a tenfold
   responsibility laid upon them. For what is their office? Nothing less
   than to move the vast inertia of the soul, and place it, and keep it
   where the spiritual forces will act upon it. It is to rally the forces
   of the will, and keep the surface of the mirror bright, and ever in
   position. It is to uncover the face which is to look at Christ, and
   draw down the veil when unhallowed sights are near. You have, perhaps,
   gone with an astronomer to watch him photograph the spectrum of a star.
   As you entered the dark vault of the Observatory you saw him begin by
   lighting a candle. To see the star with? No; but to see to adjust the
   instrument to see the star with. It was the star that was going to take
   the photograph; it was, also, the astronomer. For a long time he worked
   in the dimness, screwing tubes and polishing lenses and adjusting
   reflectors, and only after much labour the finely focussed instrument
   was brought to bear. Then he blew out the light, and left the star to
   do its work upon the plate alone. The day's task for the Christian is
   to bring his instrument to bear. Having done that he may blow out his
   candle. All the evidences of Christianity which have brought him there,
   all aids to Faith, all acts of Worship, all the leverages of the
   Church, all Prayer and Meditation, all girding of the Will--these
   lesser processes, these candle-light activities for that supreme hour
   may be set aside. But, remember, it is but for an hour. The wise man
   will be he who quickest lights his candle; the wisest he who never let
   it out. To-morrow, the next moment, he, a poor, darkened, slurred soul,
   may need it again to focus the Image better, to take a mote off the
   ens, to clear the mirror from a breath with which the world has dulled
   it.

   No re-adjustment is ever required on behalf of the Star. That is one
   great fixed point in this shifting universe. But the world moves. And
   each day, each hour, demands a further motion and re-adjustment for the
   soul. A telescope in an observatory follows a star by clockwork, but
   the clockwork of the soul is called the Will. Hence, while the soul in
   passivity reflects the Image of the Lord, the Will in intense activity
   holds the mirror in position lest the drifting motion of the world bear
   it beyond the line of vision. To "follow Christ" is largely to keep the
   soul in such position as will allow for the motion of the earth. And
   this calculated counteracting of the movements of a world, this holding
   of the mirror exactly opposite to the Mirrored, this steadying of the
   faculties unerringly, through cloud and earthquake, fire and sword, is
   the stupendous co-operating labour of the Will. It is all man's work.
   It is all Christ's work. In practice, it is both; in theory it is both.
   But the wise man will say in practice, "It depends upon myself."

   In the Galerie des Beaux Arts in Paris there stands a famous statue. It
   was the last work of a great genius, who, like many a genius, was very
   poor and lived in a garret which served as studio and sleeping-room
   alike. When the statue was all but finished, one midnight a sudden
   frost fell upon Paris. The sculptor lay awake in the fireless room and
   thought of the still moist clay, thought how the water would freeze in
   the pores and destroy in an hour the dream of his life. So the old man
   rose from his couchand heaped the bed-clothes reverently round his
   work. In the morning when the neighbours entered the room the sculptor
   was dead. But the statue lived.

   The Image of Christ that is forming within us--that is life's one
   charge. Let every project stand aside for that "Till Christ be formed"
   no man's work is finished, no religion crowned, no life has fulfilled
   its end. Is the infinite task begun? When, how, are we to be different?
   Time cannot change men. Death cannot change men. Christ can. Wherefore,
   put on Christ.

PAX VOBISCUM

   Come unto Me all ye that are weary and heavy-laden and I will give you
   rest.

   Take My Yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am Meek and Lowly in
   heart, and ye shall find Rest unto your souls. For My Yoke is easy and
   My Burden Light.

  INTRODUCTORY

   HEARD the other morning a sermon by a distinguished preacher upon
   "Rest." It was full of delightful thoughts; but when I came to ask
   myself," How does he say I can yet Rest?" there was no answer. The
   sermon was sincerely meant to be practical, yet it contained no
   experience that seemed to me to be tangible, nor any advice which could
   help me to find the thing itself as I went about the world that
   afternoon. Yet this omission of the only important problem was not the
   fault of the preacher. The whole popular religion is in the twilight
   here. And when pressed for really working specifics for the experiences
   with which it deals, it falters, and seems to lose itself in mist.

   This want of connection between the great words of religion and
   every-day life has bewildered and discouraged all of us. Christianity
   possesses the noblest words in the language; its literature overflows
   with terms expressive of the greatest and happiest moods which can fill
   the soul of man. Rest, Joy, Peace, Faith, Love, Light--these words
   occur with such persistency in hymns and prayers that an observer might
   think they formed the staple of Christian experience. But on coming to
   close quarters with the actual life of most of us, how surely would he
   be disenchanted. I do not think we ourselves are aware how much our
   Religious life is made up of phrases; how much of what we call
   Christian experience is only a dialect of the Churches, a mere
   religious phraseology with almost nothing behind it in what we really
   feel and know.

   For some of us, indeed, the Christian experiences seem further away
   than when we took the first steps in the Christian life. That life has
   not opened out as we had hoped; we do not regret our religion, but we
   are disappointed with it. There are times, perhaps, when wandering
   notes from diviner music stray into our spirits; but these experiences
   come at few and fitful moments. We have no sense of possession in them.
   When they visit us, it is a surprise. When they leave us, it is without
   explanation. When we wish their return, we do not know how to secure it

   All which points to a religion without solid base, and a poor and
   flickering life. It means a great bankruptcy in those experiences which
   give Christianity its personal solace and make it attractive to the
   world, and a great uncertainty as to any remedy. It is as if we knew
   everything about health-- except the way to get it.

   I am quite sure that the difficulty does not lie in the fact that men
   are not in earnest. This is simply not the fact. All around us
   Christians are wearing themselves out in trying to be better. The
   amount of spiritual longing in the world--in the hearts of unnumbered
   thousands of men and women in whom we should never suspect it; among
   the wise and thoughtful; among the young and gay, who seldom assuage
   and never betray their thirst--this is one of the most wonderful and
   touching facts of life. It is not more heat that is needed, but more
   light; not more force, but a wiser direction to be given to very real
   energies already there.

   What Christian experience wants is thread, a vertebral column, method.
   It is impossible to believe that there is no remedy for its unevenness
   and dishevelment, or that the remedy is a secret. The idea, also, that
   some few men, by happy chance or happier temperament, have acquired the
   secret--as if there were some sort of knack or trick of it--is wholly
   incredible. Religion must ripen its fruit for men of every temperament;
   and the way even into its highest heights must be by a gateway through
   which the peoples of the world may pass.

   I shall try to lead up to this gateway by a very familiar path. But as
   that path is strangely unfrequented, and even unknown where it passes
   into the religious sphere, I must dwell for a moment on the commonest
   of commonplaces.
     __________________________________________________________________

  EFFECTS REQUIRE CAUSES

   NOTHING that happens in the world happens by chance. God is a God of
   order. Everything is arranged upon definite principles, and never at
   random. The world, even the religious world, is governed by law.
   Character is governed by law. Happiness is governed by law. The
   Christian experiences are governed by law. Men, forgetting this, expect
   Rest, Joy, Peace, Faith, to drop into their souls from the air like
   snow or rain. But in point of fact they do not do so; and if they did
   they would no less have their origin in previous activities and be
   controlled by natural laws. Rain and snow do drop from the air, but not
   without a long previous history. They are the mature effects of former
   causes. Equally so are Rest, and Peace, and Joy. They, too, have each a
   previous history Storms and winds and calms are not accidents, but are
   brought about by antecedent circumstances. Rest and Peace are but calms
   in man's inward nature, and arise through causes as definite and as
   inevitable.

   Realize it thoroughly: it is a methodical not an accidental world. If a
   housewife turns out a good cake, it is the result of a sound receipt,
   carefully applied. She cannot mix the assigned ingredients and fire
   them for the appropriate time without producing the result. It is not
   she who has made the cake; it is nature. She brings related things
   together; sets causes at work; these causes bring about the result. She
   is not a creator, but an intermediary. She does not expect random
   causes to produce specific effects--random ingredients would only
   produce random cakes. So it is in the making of Christian experiences.
   Certain lines are followed; certain effects are the result. These
   effects cannot but be the result. But the result can never take place
   without the previous cause. To expect results without antecedents is to
   expect cakes without ingredients. That impossibility is precisely the
   almost universal expectation.

   Now what I mainly wish to do isto help you to firmly grasp this simple
   principle of Cause and Effect in the spiritual world. And instead of
   applying the principle generally to each of the Christian experiences
   in turn, I shall examine its application to one in some little detail.
   The one I shall select is Rest. And I think any one who follows the
   application in this single instance will be able to apply it for
   himself to all the others.

   Take such a sentence as this: African explorers are subject to fevers
   which cause restlessness and delirium. Note the expression, "cause
   restlessness." Restlessness has a cause. Clearly, then, any one who
   wished to get rid of restlessness would proceed at once to deal with
   the cause. If that were not removed, a doctor might prescribe a hundred
   things, and all might be taken inturn, without producing the least
   effect. Things are so arranged in the original planning of the world
   that certain effects must follow certain causes, and certain causes
   must be abolished before certain effects can be removed. Certain parts
   of Africa are inseparably linked with the physical experience called
   fever; this fever is in turn infallibly linked with a mental experience
   called restlessness and delirium. To abolish the mental experience the
   radical method would be to abolish the physical experience, and the way
   of abolishing the physical experience would be to abolish Africa, or to
   cease to go there. Now this holds good for all other forms of
   Restlessness. Every other form and kind of Restlessness in the world
   has a definite cause, and the particular kind of Restlessness can only
   be removed by removing the allotted cause.

   All this is also true of Rest. Restlessness has a cause: Must not Rest
   have a cause? Necessarily. If it were a chance world we would not
   expect this; but, being a methodical world, it cannot be otherwise.
   Rest, physical rest, moral rest, spiritual rest, every kind of rest has
   a cause, as certainly as restlessness. Now causes are discriminating.
   There is one kind of cause for every particular effect, and no other;
   and if one particular effect is desired, the corresponding cause must
   be set in motion. It is no use proposing finely devised schemes, or
   going through general pious exercises in the hope that somehow Rest
   will come. The Christian life is not casual but causal. All nature is a
   standing protest against the absurdity of expecting to secure spiritual
   effects, or any effects, without the employment of appropriate causes.
   The Great Teacher dealt what ought to have been the final blow to this
   infinite irrelevancy by a single question, "Do men gather grapes of
   thorns or figs of thistles?"

   Why, then, did the Great Teacher not educate His followers fully? Why
   did He not tell us, for example, how such a thing as Rest might be
   obtained? The answer is, that He did.  But plainly, explicitly, in so
   many words? Yes, plainly, explicitly, in so many words. He assigned
   Rest to its cause, in words with which each of us has been familiar
   from our earliest childhood.

   He begins, you remember--for you at once know the passage I refer
   to--almost as if Rest could be had without any cause: "Come unto Me" He
   says, "and I will give you Rest."

   Rest, apparently, was a favour to be bestowed; men had but to come to
   Him; He would give it to every applicant. But the next sentence takes
   that all back. The qualification, indeed, is added instantaneously. For
   what the first sentence seemed to give was next thing to an
   impossibility. For how, in a literal sense, can Rest be given? One
   could no more give away Rest than he could give away Laughter. We speak
   of "causing" laughter, which we can do; but we cannot give it away.
   When we speak of giving pain, we know perfectly well we cannot give
   pain away. And when we aim at giving pleasure, all that we do is to
   arrange a set of circumstances in such a way as that these shall cause
   pleasure. Of course there is a sense, and a very wonderful sense, in
   which a Great Personality breathes upon all who come within its
   influence an abiding peace and trust. Men can be to other men as the
   shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land. Much more Christ; much more
   Christ as Perfect Man; much more still as Saviour of the world. But it
   is not this of which I speak. When Christ said He would give men Rest,
   He meant simply that He would put them in the way of it. By no act of
   conveyance would, or could, He make over His own Rest to them. He could
   give them His receipt for it. That was all. But He would not make it
   for them; for one thing, it was not in His plan to make it for them;
   for another thing, men were not so planned that it could be made for
   them; and for yet another thing, it was a thousand times better that
   they should make it for themselves.

   That this is the meaning becomes obvious from the wording of the second
   sentence: "Learn of Me and ye shall find Rest." Rest, that is to say,
   is not a thing that can be given, but a thing to be acquired. It comes
   not by an act, but by a process. It is not to be found in a happy hour,
   as one finds a treasure; but slowly, as one finds knowledge. It could
   indeed be no more found in a moment than could knowledge. A soil has to
   be prepared for it. Like a fine fruit, it will grow in one climate and
   not in another; at one altitude and not atanother. Like all growths it
   will have an orderly development and mature by slow degrees.

   The nature of this slow process Christ clearly defines when He says we
   are to achieve Rest by learning. "Learn of Me," He says, "and ye shall
   find rest to your souls." Now consider the extraordinary originality of
   this utterance. How novel the connection between these two words,
   "Learn" and "Rest"? How few of us have ever associated them--ever
   thought that Rest was a thing to be learned; ever laid ourselves out
   for it as we would to learn a language; ever practised it as we would
   practise the violin. Does it not show how entirely new Christ's
   teaching still is to the world, that so old and threadbare an aphorism
   should still be so little applied? The last thing most of us would have
   thought of would have been to associate Rest with Work.

   What must one work at? What is that which if duly learned will find the
   soul of man in Rest? Christ answers without the least hesitation. He
   specifies two things-- Meekness and Lowliness. "Learn of Me," He says,
   "for I am meek and lowly in heart." Now these two things are not chosen
   at random. To these accomplishments, in a special way, Rest is
   attached. Learn these, in short, and you have already found Rest. These
   as they stand are direct causes of Rest; will produce it at once;
   cannot but produce it at once. And if you think for a single moment,
   you will see how this is necessarily so, for causes are never
   arbitrary, and the connection between antecedent and consequent here
   and everywhere lies deep in the nature of things.

   What is the connection, then?  I answer by a further question. What are
   the chief causes of Unrest? If you know yourself, you will answer
   Pride, Selfishness, Ambition. As you look back upon the past years of
   your life, is it not true that its unhappiness has chiefly come from
   the succession of personal mortifications and almost trivial
   disappointments which the intercourse of life has brought you? Great
   trials come at lengthened intervals, and we rise to breast them; but it
   is the petty friction of our every-day life with one another, the jar
   of business or of work, the discord of the domestic circle, the
   collapse of our ambition, the crossing of our will, the taking down of
   our conceit, which make inward peace impossible. Wounded vanity, then,
   disappointed hopes, unsatisfied selfishness--these are the old, vulgar,
   universal sources of man's unrest.

   Now it is obvious why Christ pointed out as the two chief objects for
   attainment the exact opposites of these. To Meekness and Lowliness
   these things simply do not exist. They cure unrest by making it
   impossible. These remedies do not trifle with surface symptoms; they
   strike at once at removing causes. The ceaseless chagrin of a
   self-centered life can be removed at once by learning Meekness and
   Lowliness of heart. He who learns them is for ever proof against it. He
   lives henceforth a charmed life. Christianity is a fine inoculation, a
   transfusion of healthy blood into an anaemic or poisoned soul. No fever
   can attack a perfectly sound body; no fever of unrest can disturb a
   soul which has breathed the air or learned the ways of Christ. Men sigh
   for the wings of a dove that they may fly away and be at Rest. But
   flying away will not help us. "The Kingdom of God is within you."  We
   aspire to the top to look for Rest; it lies at the bottom. Water rests
   only when it gets to the lowest place. So do men. Hence, be lowly. The
   man who has no opinion of himself at all can never be hurt if others do
   not acknowledge him. Hence, be meek. He who is without expectation
   cannot fret if nothing comes to him. It is self-evident that these
   things are so. The lowly man and the meek man are really above all
   other men, above all other things. They dominate the world because they
   do not care for it.  The miser does not possess gold, gold possesses
   him. But the meek possess it "The meek" said Christ, "inherit the
   earth."  They do not buy it; they do not conquer it; butthey inherit
   it.

   There are people who go about the world looking out for slights, and
   they are necessarily miserable, for they find them at every
   turn--especially the imaginary ones. One has the same pity for such men
   as for the very poor. They are the morally illiterate. They have had no
   real education, for they have never learned how to live. Few men know
   how to live. We grow up at random, carrying into mature life the merely
   animal methods and motives which we had as little children. And it does
   not occur to us that all this must be changed; that much of it must be
   reversed; that life is the finest of the Fine Arts; that it has to be
   learned with lifelong patience, and that the years of our pilgrimage
   are all too short to master it triumphantly.

   Yet this is what Christianity is for--to Teach men the Art of Life And
   its whole curriculum lies in one word--"Learn of Me." Unlike most
   education, this is almost purely personal, it is not to be had from
   books or lectures or creeds or doctrines. It is a study from the life.
   Christ never said much in mere words about the Christian graces. He
   lived them, He was them. Yet we do not merely copy Him. We learn His
   art by living with Him, like the old apprentices with their masters.

   Now we understand it all?  Christ's invitation to the weary and
   heavy-laden is a call to begin life over again upon a new principle
   upon His own principle. "Watch My way of doing things," He says.
   "Follow Me. Take life as I take it. Be meek and lowly and you will find
   Rest."

   I do not say, remember, that the Christian life toevery man, or to any
   man, can be a bed of roses. No educational process can be this. And
   perhaps if some men knew how muchwas involved in the simple "learn" of
   Christ, they would not enter His school with so irresponsible a heart.
   For there is not only much to learn, but much to unlearn. Many men
   never go to this school at all till their disposition is already half
   ruined and character has taken on its fatal set. To learn arithmetic is
   difficult at fifty--much more to learn Christianity. To learn simply
   what it is to be meek and lowly, in the case of one who has had no
   lessons in that in childhood, may cost him half of what he values most
   on earth. Do we realize, for instance, that the way of teaching
   humility is generally by humiliation? There is probably no other school
   for it. When a man enters himself as a pupil in such a school it means
   a very great thing. There is much Rest there, but there is alsomuch
   Work.

   I should be wrong, even though my theme is the brighter side, to ignore
   the cross and minimise the cost. Only it gives to the cross a more
   definite meaning, and a rarer value, to connect it thus directly and
   causally with the growth of the inner life. Our platitudes on the
   "benefits of affliction" are usually about as vague as our theories of
   Christian Experience. "Somehow," we believe affliction does us good.
   But it is not a question of "Somehow." The result is definite,
   calculable, necessary. It is under the strictest law of cause and
   effect. The first effect of losing one's fortune, for instance, is
   humiliation; and the effect of humiliation, as we have just seen, is to
   make one humble; and the effect of being humble is to produce Rest. It
   is a round-about way, apparently, of producing Rest; but Nature
   generally works by circular processes; and it is not certain that there
   is any other way of becoming humble, or of finding Rest. If a man could
   make himself humble to order, it might simplify matters, but we do not
   find that this happens. Hence we must allgo through the mill. Hence
   death, death to the lower self, is the nearest gate, and the quickest
   road to life.

   Yet this is only half the truth. Christ's life outwardly was one of the
   most troubled lives that was ever lived: Tempest and tumult, tumult and
   tempest, the waves breaking over it all the time till the worn body was
   laid in the grave. But the inner life was a sea of glass. The great
   calm was always there. At any moment you might have gone to Him and
   found Rest. And even when the blood-hounds were doggingHim in the
   streets of Jerusalem, He turned to His disciples and offered them, as a
   last legacy, "My peace."  Nothing ever for a moment broke the serenity
   of Christ's life on earth. Misfortune could not reach him; He had no
   fortune. Food, raiment, money-fountain-heads of half the world's
   weariness-- He simply did not care for; they played no part in his
   life; He "took no thought" for them. It was impossible to affect Him by
   lowering His reputation; He had already made Himself of no reputation.
   He was dumb before insult. When He was reviled He reviled not again. In
   fact, there was nothing that the world could do to Him that could
   ruffle the surface of His spirit.

   Such living, as mere living, is altogether unique. It is only when we
   see what it was in Him that we can know what the word Rest means. It
   lies not in emotions, nor in the absence of emotions. It is not a
   hallowed feeling that comes over us in church. It is not something that
   the preacher has in his voice. It is not in nature, nor in poetry, nor
   in music--though in all these there is soothing. It is the mind at
   leisure from itself. It is the perfect poise of the soul; the absolute
   adjustment of the inward man to the stress of all outward things; the
   preparedness against every emergency; the stability of assured
   convictions; the eternal calm of an invulnerable faith; the repose of a
   heart set deep in God. It is the mood of the man who says, with
   Browning, "God's in His Heaven, all's well with the world."

   Two painters each painted a picture to illustrate his conception of
   rest. The first chose for his scene a still, lone lake among the
   far-off mountains. The second threw on his canvas a thundering
   waterfall, with a fragile birch-tree bending over the foam; at the fork
   of a branch, almost wet with the cataract's spray, a robin sat on its
   nest. The first was only Stagnation; the last was Rest. For in Rest
   there are always two elements --tranquillity and energy; silence and
   turbulence; creation and destruction; fearlessness and fearfulness.
   This it was in Christ.

   It isquite plain from all this that whatever else He claimed to be or
   to do, He at least knew how to live. All this is the perfection of
   living, of living in the mere sense of passing through the world in the
   best way. Hence His anxiety to communicate His idea of life to others.
   He came, He said, to give men life, true life, a more abundant life
   than they were living; "the life," as the fine phrase in the Revised
   Version has it, "that is life indeed." This is what He himself
   possessed, and it was this which He offers to all mankind. And hence
   His direct appeal for all to come to Him who had not made much of life,
   who were weary and heavy-laden. These He would teach His secret. They,
   also, should know"the life that is life indeed".
     __________________________________________________________________

  WHAT YOKES ARE FOR

   THERE is still one doubt to clear up. After the statement, "Learn of
   Me," Christ throws in the disconcerting qualification, "Take My yoke
   upon you and learn of Me."  Why, if all this be true, does He call it a
   yoke?  Why, while professing to give Rest, does He with the next breath
   whisper "burden"?  Is the Christian life after all, what its enemies
   take it for--an additional weight to the already great woeof life, some
   extra punctiliousness about duty, some painful devotion to observances,
   some heavy restriction and trammelling of all that is joyous and free
   in the world?  Is life not hard and sorrowful enough without being
   fettered with yet another yoke?

   It is astounding how so glaring a misunderstanding of this plain
   sentence shouldever have passed into currency. Did you ever stop to ask
   what a yoke is really for?  Is it to be a burden to the animal which
   wears it?  It is just the opposite.  It is to make its burden light.
   Attached to the oxen in any other way than by a yoke, the plough would
   be intolerable. Worked by means of a yoke, it is light. A yoke is not
   an instrument of torture; it is an instrument of mercy. It is not a
   malicious contrivance for making work hard; it is a gentle device to
   make hard labour light.  It is not meant to give pain, but to save
   pain. And yet men speak of theyoke of Christ as if it were a slavery,
   and look upon those who wear it as objects of compassion?  For
   generations we have had homilies on "The Yoke of Christ," some
   delighting in portraying its narrow exactions; some seeking in these
   exactions the marks of its divinity; others apologising for it, and
   toning it down; still others assuring us that, although it be very bad,
   it is not tobe compared with the positive blessings of Christianity.
   How many, especially among the young, has this one mistakenphrase
   driven for ever away from the kingdom of God?  Instead of making Christ
   attractive, it makes Him out a taskmaster, narrowing life by petty
   restrictions, calling for self-denial where none is necessary, making
   misery a virtue under the plea that it is the yoke of Christ, and
   happinesscriminal because it now and then evades it. According to this
   conception, Christians are at best the victims of a depressing fate;
   their life is a penance; and their hope for the next world purchased by
   a slow martyrdom in this.

   The mistake has arisen from taking the word "yoke" here in the same
   sense as in the expressions "under the yoke," or "wear the yoke in his
   youth." But in Christ's illustration it is not the jugum of the Roman
   soldier, but the simple "harness" or "ox-collar" of the Eastern
   peasant.  It is the literal wooden yoke which He, with His own hands in
   the carpenter's shop, had probably often made. He knew the difference
   between a smooth yoke and a rough one, a bad fit and a good fit;the
   difference also it made tothe patient animal which had to wear it.  The
   rough yoke galled, and the burden was heavy; the smooth yoke caused no
   pain, and the load was lightly drawn. The badly fitted harness was a
   misery; the well fitted collar was "easy."

   And what was the "burden"? It was not some special burden laid upon the
   Christian, some unique infliction that he alone must bear. It was what
   all men bear. It was simply life, human life itself, the generalburden
   of life which all must carry with them from the cradle to the grave.
   Christ saw that men took life painfully. To some it was a weariness, to
   others a failure, to many a tragedy, to all a struggle and a pain. How
   to carry this burden of life had beenthe whole world's problem. It is
   still the whole world's problem. And here is Christ's solution: "Carry
   it as I do. Take life as I take it. Look at it from My point of view.
   Interpret it upon My principles.Take My yoke and learn of Me, and you
   will find it easy. For My yoke is easy, works easily, sits right upon
   the shoulders, and therefore my burden is light."

   There is no suggestion here that religion will absolve any man from
   bearing burdens.  That would be to absolve him from living, since it is
   life itself that is the burden.  What Christianity does propose is to
   make it tolerable. Christ's yoke is simply His secret for the
   alleviation of human life, His prescription for the best and happiest
   method of living. Men harness themselves to the work and stress of the
   world in clumsy and unnatural ways. The harness they put on is
   antiquated. A rough, ill-fitted collar at the best, they make its
   strain and friction past enduring, by placing it where the neck is most
   sensitive; and by mere continuous irritation this sensitiveness
   increases until the whole nature is quick and sore.

   This is the origin, among other things, of a disease called
   "touchiness"--a disease which, in spite of its innocent name, is one of
   thegravest sources of restlessness in the world.  Touchiness, when it
   becomes chronic, is a morbid condition of the inward disposition.  It
   is self-love inflamed to the acute point; conceit,with a hair-trigger.
   The cure is to shift the yoke to some other place; to let men and
   things touch us throughsome new and perhaps as yet unusedpart of our
   nature;to become meek and lowly in heart while the old nature is
   becoming numb from want of use. It is the beautiful work of
   Christianity everywhere to adjust the burden of life to those who bear
   it, and them toit. It has a perfectly miraculous gift of healing.
   Without doing any violence to human nature it sets it right with life,
   harmonizing it with all surrounding things, and restoring those who are
   jaded with the fatigue and dust of the world to a new grace of living.
   In the mere matter of altering he perspective of life and changing the
   proportions of things, its function in lightening the care of man is
   altogether its own. The weight of a load depends upon the attraction of
   the earth.  But suppose the attraction of the earth were removed? A ton
   on some other planet, where the attraction of gravity is less, does not
   weigh half a ton. Now Christianity removes the attraction of the earth,
   and this is one way in which it diminishes men's burden. It makes them
   citizens of another world. What was a ton yesterday is not half a ton
   today. So, without changing one's circumstances, merely by offering a
   wider horizon and a different standard, it alters the whole aspect of
   the world.

   Christianity as Christ taught it is the truest philosophy of life ever
   spoken. But let us be quite sure when we speak of Christianity that we
   mean Christ's Christianity. Other versions are either caricatures, or
   exaggerations, or misunderstandings, or short-sighted and surface
   readings. For the most part their attainment is hopeless and the
   results wretched. But I care not who the person is, or through what
   vale of tears he has passed, or is about to pass, there is a new life
   forhim along this path.

  HOW FRUITS GROW

   WERE Rest my subject, there are other things I should wish to say about
   it, and other kinds of Rest of which I should like to speak. But that
   is not my subject. My theme is that the Christian experiences are not
   the work of magic, but come under the law of Cause and Effect. And I
   have chosen Rest only as a single illustration of the working of that
   principle. If there were time I might next run over all the Christian
   experiences in turn, and show how the same wide law applies to each.
   But I think it may serve the better purpose if I leave this further
   exercise to yourselves. I know no Bible study that you will find more
   full of fruit, or which will take you nearer to the ways of God, or
   make the Christian life itself more solid or more sure. I shall add
   only a single other illustration of what I mean, before I close

   Where does Joy come from?  I knew a Sunday scholar whose conception of
   Joy was that it was a thing made in lumps and kept somewhere in Heaven,
   and that when people prayed for it, pieces were somehow let down and
   fitted into their souls.  I am not sure that views as gross and
   material are not often held by people who ought to be wiser.  In
   reality, Joy is as much a matter of Cause and Effect as pain.  No one
   can get Joy by merely asking for it.  It is one of the ripest fruits of
   the Christian life, and, like all fruits, must be grown. There is a
   very clever trick in India called the mango-trick. A seed is put in the
   ground and covered up, and after divers incantations a full-blown
   mango-bush appears within five minutes. I never met any one who knew
   how the thing was done, but I never met any one who believed it to be
   anything else than a conjuring-trick. The world is pretty unanimous now
   in its belief in the orderliness of Nature.  Men may not know how
   fruits grow, but they do know that they cannot grow in five minutes.
   Some lives have not even a stalk on which fruits could hang, even if
   they did grow in five minutes. Some have never planted one sound seed
   of Joy in all their lives; and others who may have planted a germ or
   two have lived so little in sunshine that they never could come to
   maturity.

   Whence, then, is Joy?  Christ put His teaching upon this subject into
   one of the most exquisite of His parables.  I should in any instance
   have appealed to His teaching here, as in the case of Rest, for I do
   not wish you to think I am speaking words of my own. But it so happens
   that He has dealt with it in a passage of unusual fulness.

   I need not recall the whole illustration. It is the parable of the
   Vine. Did you ever think why Christ spoke that parable?  He did not
   merely throw it into space as a fine illustration of general truths. It
   was not simply a statement of the mystical union, and the doctrine of
   an indwelling Christ. It was that; but it was more. After He had said
   it, He did what was not an unusual thing when He was teaching His
   greatest lessons. He turned to the disciples and said He would tell
   them why he had spoken it.  It was to tell them how to get Joy. "These
   things have I spoken unto you," He said, "that My Joy might remain in
   you and that your Joy might be full."  It was a purposed and deliberate
   communication of His secret of Happiness.

   Go back over these verses, then, and you will find the Causes of this
   Effect, the spring, and the only spring, out of which true Happiness
   comes. I am not going to analyse them in detail. I ask you to enter
   into the words for yourselves. Remember, In the first place, that the
   Vine was the Eastern symbol of Joy.  It was its fruit that made glad
   the heart of man. Yet, however innocent that gladness--for the
   expressed juice of the grape was the common drink at every peasant's
   board--the gladness was only a gross and passing thing. This was not
   true happiness, and the vine of the Palestine vineyards was not the
   true vine.  Christ was "the true Vine."  Here, then, is the ultimate
   source of Joy.  Through whatever media it reaches us, all true Joyand
   Gladness find their source in Christ.  By this, of course, is not meant
   that the actual Joyexperienced is transferred from Christ's nature, or
   is something passed on from Him to us. What is passed on is His method
   of getting it. There is, indeed, a sense in which we can share
   another's joy or another's sorrow. But that is another matter.Christ is
   the source of Joyto men in the sense in which He is the source of rest.
   His people share His life, and therefore share its consequences, and
   one of these is Joy. His method of living is one that in the nature of
   things produces Joy. When He spoke of His Joy remaining with us He
   meant in part that the causes which produced it should continue to act.
   His followers, that is to say, by repeating His life would experience
   its accompaniments. His Joy, His kind of Joy, would remain with them.

   The medium through which this Joy comes is next explained: "He that
   abideth in Me the same bringeth forth much fruit." Fruit first, Joy
   next; the one the cause or medium of the other. Fruit-bearing is the
   necessary antecedent; Joy both the necessary consequent and the
   necessary accompaniment. It lies partly in the bearing fruit, partly in
   the fellowship which makes that possible. Partly that is to say, Joy
   lies in mere constant living in Christ's presence, with all that that
   implies of peace, of shelter, and of love; partly in the influence of
   that Life upon mind and character and will; and partly in the
   inspiration to live and work for others, with all that that brings of
   self-riddance and Joy in other's gain. All these, in different ways and
   at different times, are sources of pure Happiness. Even the simplest of
   them --to do good to other people--is an instant and infallible
   specific. There is no mystery about Happiness whatever. Put in the
   right ingredients and it must come out. He that abideth in Him will
   bring forth much fruit; and bringing forth much fruit is Happiness. The
   infallible receipt for Happiness, then, is to do good; and the
   infallible receipt for doing good is to abide in Christ. The surest
   proof that all this is a plain matter of Cause and Effect is that men
   may try every other conceivable way of finding Happiness, and they will
   fail. Only the right cause in each case can produce the right effect.

   Then the Christian experiences are our own making? In the same sense in
   which grapes are our own making, and no more. All fruits grow--whether
   they grow in the soil or in the soul; whether they are the fruits of
   the wild grape or of the True Vine. No man can make things grow. He can
   get them to grow by arranging all the circumstances and fulfilling all
   the conditions. But the growing is done by God. Causes and effects are
   eternal arrangements, set in the constitution of the world; fixed
   beyond man's ordering. What man can do is to place himself in the midst
   of a chain of sequences. Thus he can get things to grow: thus he
   himself can grow. But the grower is the Spirit of God.

   What more need I add but this--test the method by experiment. Do not
   imagine that you have got these things because you know how to get
   them. As well try to feed upon a cookery book. But I think I can
   promise that if you try in this simple and natural way, you will not
   fail. Spend the time you have spent in sighing for fruits in fulfilling
   the conditions of their growth. The fruits will come, must come. We
   have hitherto paid immense attention toeffects, to the mere experiences
   themselves; we have described them, extolled them, advised them, prayed
   for them -- done everything but find out what caused them. Henceforth
   let us deal with causes. "To be," says Lotze, "is to be in relations."
   About every other method of living the Christian life there is an
   uncertainty. About every other method of acquiring the Christian
   experiences there is a "perhaps." But in so far as this method is the
   way of nature, it cannot fail. Its guarantee is the laws of the
   universe, and these are "the Hands of the Living God."
