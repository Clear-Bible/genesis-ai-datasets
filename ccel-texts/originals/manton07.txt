SERMON LIII.

   And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
   loved.--Ver. 47.

   THE man of God is giving arguments to enforce his request that the word
   of truth might not be taken utterly out of his mouth.'

   1. He could not bear it, because all his hopes of felicity were built
   upon it, ver. 43.

   2. He promiseth constancy of obedience, ver. 44.

   3. Liberty of practice, ver. 45.

   4. Liberty of profession, not hindered by fear or shame, but should be
   borne out with confidence in that profession.

   5. He urgeth in the text with what delight he should carry on the work
   of obedience, And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I
   have loved.' In which observe--

   1. His great pleasure and contentment is asserted and professed, I will
   delight myself.

   2. The object of it, in thy commandments.

   3. The fundamental reason or bottom cause of this delight, which I have
   loved.

   Doct. A gracious heart doth Jove and delight in the commandments of
   God: the godly are described by it. Hence David makes it the character
   of a blessed man: Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the Lord, and
   in that law doth he meditate day and night.' And Ps. cxii. 1, Blessed
   is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his
   commandments.' Paul asserts of himself, as a comfortable evidence of
   his sincerity in the midst of his infirmities, Rom. vii. 22, For I
   delight in the law of God after the inward man.' By the inward man' he
   means the renewed part, that is pleased with all things that please
   God, if we have such a delight as is above the delight of sense, &c. I
   will--

   1. Explain the point as it lieth here in the text.

   2. Show how the heart is brought to this; for corrupt nature is
   otherwise affected.

   First, To explain the point.

   1. His pleasure and contentment is asserted, I will delight myself.' A
   Christian hath his joys and delights, but they are pure and chaste;
   they delight in the Lord, and in his word and ways: Phil. iv. 4,
   Rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say, Rejoice.' He hath a
   liberty, alla` monon en kurio, but only in the Lord,' 1 Cor. vii. 39;
   not only may, but must. It is his duty. Joy is a great part of his
   work; not our felicity or wages only, but our work also. Now, I shall
   prove that all the pleasures and delights of the earth are nothing to
   the pleasures and delights which the godly do find in God and in a holy
   life.

   [1.] These delights are more substantial. It is not a superficial joy
   that they are delighted withal, but a substantial joy. It must needs be
   so, partly because these are better grounded, not built upon a mistake
   and fancy, but the highest warrant and surest foundation which mankind
   can build upon, the word of the eternal God, which can never fail;
   whereas the joy that is merely built upon carnal delights is built upon
   a fancy and mistake. Both are represented by the apostle: 1 John ii.
   17, The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doth the
   will of God abideth for ever.' If they considered the shortness of
   their pleasures, and in what a doleful case their wealth, and honour,
   and fleshly delights will leave them, they would have little list to be
   merry till they had looked after a more stable blessedness. The world
   will be soon gone, and the lust and gust thereof gone also; but he that
   goeth on with the work of holiness, building on the promise of another
   world, layeth a sure foundation. Partly because they do more intimately
   affect the soul. Sensual delights do not go so deep as the delights of
   holiness: Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in
   the time when their corn and their wine increased:' like a soaking
   shower that goeth to the root. The other tickleth the senses; poor,
   slight, and outside comforts, that do not fortify the heart against
   distresses, much less against the remembrance of our judge, or the
   fears of an offended God, or the serious thoughts of another world. For
   these two reasons, the joys of a Christian, stirred up in him by the
   conformity of his will to the will of God, are solid, substantial joys.
   A wicked man may be jocund and jovial, but he hath not the true
   delight; he may have more mirth, but the Christian hath the true joy:
   In the midst of mirth the heart is sorrowful.' It is easy to be merry,
   but it is not easy to be joyful, or to get a substantial delight.

   [2.] These delights are more perfective; a man is the better for them.
   Other delights, that please the flesh, feed corruption, but these
   corroborate and strengthen graces. They are so far from disordering the
   mind, and leading us to sin, that they compose and purify the mind, and
   make sin more odious, and fortify us against the baits of sense, which
   are the occasion of all the sin in the world. All our joy is to be
   considered with respect to its use and profit: Eccles. ii. 2, I said of
   laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doth it?' The more a man
   delighteth in God, and in the ways of God, the more he cleaveth to him,
   and resolveth to go on in this course, and temptations to sensual
   delights do less prevail; for, the joy of the Lord is our strength.'
   The safety of the spiritual life lieth in the keeping up our joy and
   delight in it: Heb. iii. 6, Whose house are we, if we hold fast the
   confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end;' Isa. lxiv. 5,
   Thou meetest him who rejoiceth and worketh righteousness.' But now
   carnal delights intoxicate the mind, and fill it with vanity and folly.
   The sensitive lure hath more power over us to draw into the slavery of
   sin: Titus iii. 3, For we ourselves were also foolish, deceived,
   serving divers lusts and pleasures.' Surely then the healing delights
   should be preferred before the killing, wounding pleasures that so
   often prove a snare to us.

   2. The object is to be considered, Thy commandments.' Here observe--

   [1.] David did not place his delight in folly or filthiness, as they do
   that glory in their shame, or delight in sin, and give contentment to
   the lusts of the flesh; as the apostle speaks of some that sport
   themselves in their own deceivings,' 2 Peter ii. 13; that do not only
   live in sin, but make a sport of it, beguiling their own hearts with
   ground less apprehensions that there is no such evil and hazard therein
   as the word declareth and conscience sometimes suggesteth; they are be
   holden to their sottish error and delusion for their mirth. Neither did
   he place his delight in temporal trifles, the honours, and pleasures,
   and profits of the world, as brutish worldlings do; but in the word of
   God, as the seed of the new life, the rule of his conversation, the
   charter of his hopes; that blessed word by which his heart might be
   renewed and sanctified, his conscience settled, his mind acquainted
   with his Creator's will, and his affections raised to the hopes of
   glory. The matter which feedeth our pleasures showeth the excellency or
   baseness of it. If, like beetles, we delight in a dunghill rather than
   a garden, or the paradise of God's word, it shows a base, mean spirit,
   as swine in wallowing in the mire, or dogs to eat their own vomit. Our
   temper and inclination is known by our complacency or displacency: Rom.
   vii. 5, For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by
   the law did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.'
   Therefore see which your hearts carry you to to the world or the word
   of God. The most part of the world are carried to the pleasures of
   sense, and mastered by them; but a divine spirit or nature put into us
   makes us look after other things: 2 Peter i. 4, Whereby are given unto
   us exceeding great and precious promises,' even of the great blessings
   of the new covenant, such as pardon of sin, eternal life, &c.

   [2.] Not only in the promissory, but mandatory part of the word.
   Commandments is the notion in the text. There is matter of great joy
   contained in the promises, but they must not be looked upon as
   exclusive of the precepts, but inclusive. Promises are spoken of Ps.
   cxix. 111, Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever, for
   they are the rejoicing of my heart.' They contain spiritual and
   heavenly riches, and so are matter of joy to a believing soul. But the
   commandments call for duty on our parts. The precepts appoint us a
   pleasant work, show us what is to be done and left undone. These
   restraints are grateful to the new nature, for the compliance of the
   will with the will of God, and its conformity to his law, hath a
   pleasure annexed to it. A renewed soul would be subject to God in all
   things, therefore delights in his commandments without limitation or
   distinction.

   [3.] It is not in the study or contemplation of the justice and equity
   of these commandments, but in the obedience and practice of them. There
   is a pleasure in the study and contemplation, for every truth breedeth
   a delectation in the mind: Ps. xix. 8, The statutes of the Lord are
   right, rejoicing the soul.' It is a blessed and pleasant thing to have
   a sure rule commending itself with great evidence to our consciences,
   and manifesting itself to be of God. Therefore the sight of the purity
   and certainty of the word of God is a great pleasure to any considering
   mind; no other study to be compared with it. But the joy of speculation
   or contemplation is nothing to that of practice. Nothing maketh the
   heart more cheerful than a good conscience, or a constant walking in
   the way of God's commandments: 2 Cor. i. 12, Our rejoicing is this, the
   testimony of our conscience, that, with simplicity and godly sincerity,
   not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, 1 have had my
   conversation in the world.' Let me give you this gradation: The
   pleasures of contemplation exceed those of sense, and the delights of
   the mind are more sincere and real than those of the body; for the more
   noble the faculty is, the more capable of delight. A man m his study
   about natural things hath a truer pleasure than he greatest epicure m
   the most exquisite enjoyment of sense: Prov. xxiv. 13, 14, My son, eat
   thou honey because it is good, and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy
   taste; so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast
   found it; then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not
   be cut off.' But especially the contemplation of divine things is
   pleasant; the objects are more sublime, certain, necessary, profitable;
   and here we are more deeply concerned than m the study of nature.
   Surely this is sweeter than honey and honeycomb, to understand and
   contemplate the way of salvation by Christ. This is a heaven upon earth
   to know these things: John xvii. 3, This is life eternal, to know thee
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.' As much as
   the pleasures of the natural mind do exceed these bodily pleasures, so
   much do these pleasures of faith and spiritual knowledge exceed those
   of the natural mind; these things the angels desire to pry into. Now
   the delights of practical obedience do far exceed those which are the
   mere result of speculation and contemplation. Why? Because they give us
   a more intimate feeling of the truth and worth of these things, and our
   right in them thereby is more secured, and our delight in them is
   heightened by the supernatural operation of the Holy Ghost. The joy of
   the Spirit is said to be unspeakable and full of glory,' 1 Peter i. 8.
   In short, it is exercised about noble objects, the favour of God,
   reconciliation with him, and the hope of eternal life--all these as
   belonging to us; and it is excited by a higher cause, the Spirit of
   God; and lastly, it giveth us a sense of what we had but a guess
   before: we know the grace of God m truth,' Col. i. 6; we know it so as
   to taste

   3. The fundamental or bottom cause of this delight is expressed, Which
   I have loved.' There is a precedent love of the object before there can
   be any delight in it. Love is the complacency and propension of the
   soul toward that which is good, absolutely considered, abstracting both
   from presence and absence. Desire regardeth the absence and futurition
   of a good; delight the presence and fruition of it. It is impossible
   anything can be delighted in, but it must be first loved and desired.
   None can truly delight in obedience but such as desire it. By nature we
   were otherwise affected, counted his commands burdensome, because
   contrary to the desires of the flesh: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is
   enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
   indeed can be.' But when the heart is renewed by grace, then we have
   another love and another bias upon our affections: 1 John v. 3, This is
   love, to keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.'
   To others they are against the bent and the hair, and too tedious, and
   love maketh way for delight.

   Secondly, Reasons why a gracious heart doth love and delight in the
   commandments of God.

   1. The matter of these commandments showeth how much they deserve our
   love and delight. The matter respects either law or gospel. (1.) That
   which is strictly called the moral law is the decalogue; a fit rule for
   a wise God to give, or a rational creature to receive, a just and due
   admeasurement of our duty to God and man: the world cannot be without
   it. To God, that we should love him, serve him, depend upon him,
   delight in him, that we may be at length happy in his love. The law is
   holy, just, and good;' not burdensome to the reasonable nature, but
   perfective. Surely to know God, to love him, and fear him, and trust
   and repose our souls on him, and to worship him at the time, in the
   way, and manner appointed, is a delightful thing, and should be more
   delightful to us than our necessary and appointed food. To man,
   justice, charity: Micah vi. 8, He hath showed thee, O man, what is
   good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to
   love mercy;' Hosea xii. 6, Keep mercy and judgment.' Now all kinds of
   justice should not be grievous. Political justice, between the
   magistrates and people. How should we live else? This maintaineth the
   order of the world. Private justice, between man and man: Mat. vii. 12,
   Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
   ye even so to them.' Family justice, between husband and wife, parents
   and children, masters and servants. How else can a man have any
   tolerable degree of safety and comfort? 1 Peter iii. 7, Likewise, ye
   husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge.' Then for mercy,
   there is not a pleasanter work in the world than to do good; it is
   God-like. A man is as an earthly god, to comfort and supply others:
   Acts xx. 35, It is a more blessed thing to give than to receive.' And
   blessedness is not tedious; the work rewards itself. The satisfaction
   is so great of doing good, and being helpful to others, that certainly
   this is not tedious. (2.) The gospel offereth such a suitable remedy to
   mankind that the duties of it should be as pleasant and welcome to us
   as the counsel of a friend for our recovery out of a great misery into
   which we had plunged ourselves. In the law, God acteth more as a
   commander and governor; in the gospel, as a friend and counsellor.
   Surely to those that have any feeling of their sins, or fears of the
   wrath of God, what can be more welcome than the way of a pardon and
   reconciliation with God, whom his word and providence, and the fears of
   a guilty conscience, represent as an enemy to us? Surely this should be
   more pleasant than all the lust, sport, and honours, and pleasures of
   the world. Here is the foundation laid of everlasting joy, a sufficient
   answer to the terrors of the law, and the accusations of a guilty
   conscience, which is the greatest misery can befall mankind. In short,
   that the matter of God's commands deserves our delight and esteem is
   evident:--

   [1.] Because those that are unwilling to submit to them count them good
   and acceptable laws. When their particular practice and sinful customs
   have made them incompetent judges of what is fittest for themselves in
   their health and strength, yet their conscience judgeth it a more
   excellent and honourable thing in others if they can deny the pleasures
   of the flesh, and overcome the temptations of the world, and deny
   themselves the comforts of the present life, out of the hopes of that
   which is to come. Such are accounted a more excellent and better sort
   of men: Prov. xii. 26, The righteous is more excellent than his
   neighbour;' he hath more of God and of a man than others, as he hath a
   freer use of reason, and a greater command of his own lusts and
   passions. There is a reverence of such darted into the consciences of
   wicked men: Mark vi. 20, Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just
   and holy man, and observed him.'

   [2.] Because of the sentiments which men have of a holy, sober, godly
   life, when they come to die, and the disallowance of a dissolute carnal
   life: Job xxvii. 8, What is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath
   gained, when God taketh away his soul?' Ps. xxxvii. 37, Mark the
   perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.'
   When men are entering upon the confines of eternity, they are wiser;
   the fumes of lust are then blown over, their joys or fears are then
   testimonies to God's law: 1 Cor. xv. 56, The sting of death is sin, and
   the strength of sin is the law.' It is not from the fancy or melancholy
   of the dying person, nor his distemper, that his fears are awakened,
   but his reason. If it did only proceed from his distemper, men would be
   rather troubled for leaving worldly comforts than for sin. No; it is
   the apprehension of God's justice by reason of sin, who will proceed
   according to his law, which the guilty person hath so often and so much
   violated and broken. They are not the ravings of a fever, nor the
   fruits of natural weakness and credulity. No; these troubles are
   justified by the law of God or the highest reason.

   [3.] By supposing the contrary of all which God hath commanded
   concerning the embracing of virtue, shunning of vice. If God should
   free us from these laws, leave us to our own choice, command us the
   contrary, forbid us all respect to himself, commanding us to worship
   false gods, transform and misrepresent his glory by images, and fall
   down before stocks and stones, blaspheme his name continually, and
   despise all those glorious attributes which do so clearly shine forth
   in the creation; if he had commanded us to be impious to our parents,
   to fill the world with murders, adulteries, robberies, to pursue others
   with slanders and false-witnessings, to covet and take what is another
   man's, wife, ox, or ass,--the heart of man cannot allow such a conceit;
   nay, the fiercest beasts would abhor it, if they were capable of
   receiving such an impression. Now, surely a law so reasonable, so
   evident, so conducing to the honouring of God, government of ourselves,
   and commerce with others, should be very welcome and acceptable to a
   gracious heart.

   2. The state and frame of a renewed heart; they are fitted and suited
   to these commandments, and do obey them not only because enjoined, but
   because inclined. Nothing is pleasant to men but what is suitable to
   their nature; so that may be delightful to one which is loathsome to
   another; as the food and converse of a beast is loathsome to a man; one
   man's pleasure is another's pain. There is a great deal of difference
   between a carnal and a spiritual mind, the heart sanctified and
   unsanctified: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, I will take away the stony heart out
   of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh; and I will put my
   spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and keep my
   judgments to do them.' When the heart is fitted and suited by
   principles of grace, the work is not tedious, but delightful. Things
   are easy and difficult according to the poise and inclination of the
   soul. So Heb. viii. 10, I will write my laws upon their hearts, and put
   them into their minds.' The law without suiteth with an inclination
   within; and when things meet which are suitable to one another, there
   is a delight: Ps. xl. 8, Thy law is in my heart; I delight to do thy
   will, O God.' There is an inclination, not necessary, as in natural
   agents; but voluntary, as in rational agents. There is an inclination
   in natural agents, as in light bodies to move upwards, heavy bodies to
   move downwards; in rational agents, when a man is bent by his love and
   choice. This latter David speaketh of, Ps. cxix. 36, Incline my heart
   unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.' The heart of man
   standeth between two objects--the laws of God and carnal vanities. In
   our natural estate we are wholly bent to please the flesh; in our
   renewed estate there is a new bent put upon the heart. Now the old bent
   is not wholly gone, though overmastered and over powered: the false
   bias of corruption will still incline us to the delights of sense; but
   the new bias to the way everlasting, to spiritual eternal happiness: as
   that prevaileth, we love and delight in the commandments of God.

   3. The helps and assistances of the Spirit go further, and increase
   this delight in the way of God's commandments. God doth not only renew
   our wills, and fit us with an inward power to do the things that are
   pleasing in his sight, but exciteth and actuateth that power by the
   renewed influences of his grace: Phil. ii. 13, He giveth us to will and
   to do:' not only a will, or an urging and inclination to do good; but
   because of the opposition of the flesh and manifold temptations, he
   gives also a power to perform what we are inclined unto: Where the
   Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,' 2 Cor. iii. 17, or a
   readiness of mind to perform all things required of us, not only with
   diligence, but delight.

   4. The great encouragements which attend obedience, as the rewards of
   godliness both in this life and the next. The rewards of godliness in
   this life I shall speak of in the next head; for the future, the end
   sweetens the means to us. We have no mean end, but the eternal
   enjoyment of God in a complete state of glory and happiness. Now this
   hath an influence upon the love and delight of the saints, to sweeten
   their labours, and difficulties, and temptations. The scripture
   everywhere witnesseth: 1 Cor. xv. 58, Therefore, my beloved brethren,
   be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord;
   forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord:'
   Phil. iii. 14, I press towards the mark, for the prize of the high
   calling of God in Christ Jesus;' Rom. v. 2, We rejoice in hope of the
   glory of God;' and Rom. viii. 18, For I reckon that the sufferings of
   this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
   shall be revealed in us.'

   5. Present comfortable experience.

   [1.] In the general, of peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost.

   (1.) Peace, which is the natural result of the rectitude of our
   actions: The fruit of righteousness is peace,' Isa. xxxii. 17; and Ps.
   cxix. 165, Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall
   offend them.' Pax est tranquillitas ordinis. That description fits
   internal peace, as well as external. When all things keep their order
   affections are obedient to reason, and reason is guided by the Spirit
   of God according to his word, there is a quiet and rest from
   accusations m the soul.

   (2.) Joy in the Holy Ghost is distinct from the former: Horn xiv 17,
   For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and
   peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.' These two differ in the author.
   Peace of conscience is the testimony of our own souls approving the
   good we have done; joy in the Holy Ghost is a more immediate impression
   of the comforting Spirit: Rom. xv. 13, Now the God of hope fill you
   with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound m hope, through
   the power of the Holy Ghost.' They differ in their measure: peace is a
   rest from trouble; joy, a sweet reflection upon our good condition or
   happy estate. It is in the body a freedom from a disease, and a
   cheerfulness after a good meal; or in the state, peace, when no
   mutinies and disturbances; joy, when some notable benefit or profit
   accrueth to the state So here they differ in their subjects. The
   heathen, so far as they did good, might have a kind of peace or freedom
   from self-accusing and tormenting fears: Rom. ii. 15, Which show the
   work of the law written in their hearts; their consciences also bearing
   witness, and their thoughts in the meantime excusing or else accusing
   one another;' but a stranger intermeddleth not with these joys.' The
   Spirit, where a sanctifier, there he is a comforter. They differ m the
   ground. The joy of the Holy Ghost is not merely from a good conscience
   as to a particular action, but from a good estate as being accepted
   with God, who is our supreme judge, and assured of our interest in
   eternal life. They differ in effects. Peace is an approbation for the
   present; joy in the Holy Ghost a pledge and beginning of that endless
   joy we shall have hereafter: 2 Cor. i. 22 Who hath also sealed us, and
   given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts;' and Rom. viii. 23, We
   ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we
   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
   redemption of our body.' Both together show that there is no such solid
   comfort as in the obedience of God's commandments; certainly more than
   in all the pleasures of sin, yea, more than in all the enjoyments of
   the world: whoever have proved them both find it so. Many have proved
   the pleasures of sin, but never yet found what comfort is in mourning
   for sin. Many have proved the comforts of the world, but never yet
   proved what is the joy of a good conscience, and the sweet pleasure of
   a godly conversation.

   [2.] There is a particular experience, when borne out in the confession
   of truth in the time of trial. A man that out of love to God's commands
   hath endured troubles and trials, and hath overcome temptations, will
   see more cause to love these commandments, and to increase his
   obedience to them, than ever before in ordinary temptations: Ps. xix.
   11, Moreover, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them
   there is a great reward.' When they see that divine truth is like to
   bear out itself, and man that doth confess it, in such cases, they feel
   the excellency of God's truth, and the power of God sustaining them
   that confess it, therefore embrace heartily the Lord's commands, and
   take pleasure in his ways. The Lord appealeth to this experience: Micah
   ii. 7, Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?' Have not
   you found the fruit answerable? Therefore the children of God value and
   esteem and look upon them 4is the greatest means of their safety and
   comfort.

   6. Because of their love to God, they have a value for everything which
   cometh from God and leadeth to him. Common mercies point to their
   author, and their main end is to draw our affections to him, and enable
   us in his service; but these are apt to be a snare, and are used as an
   occasion to the flesh. But here is a greater impression of God on his
   word and laws; their use is more eminent to direct us to God, therefore
   are valued above ordinary comforts: Job xxiii. 12, I have not gone back
   from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his
   mouth more than my necessary food.' They are his commandments,
   therefore dear to us, who hath obliged us so much in Christ, whose love
   they believe and have felt. The word is wholly appointed to maintain
   the life of grace in us.

   Use 1. Is to show us how to bring our hearts to the obedience of God's
   commands.

   1. Love them, if we would keep them. Nothing is hard to love. An esteem
   will quicken us to the obedience of them.

   2. Delight in them, for then all goeth on easily. Delight sweeteneth
   everything, though in themselves toilsome or tedious; as fowling,
   hunting, fishing. Delight never mindeth difficulties. The reason why
   the commands are grievous is want of love and delight.

   Use 2. Showeth of what kind our obedience must be--free and
   unconstrained; when we are not forced to our duty, but do willingly
   delight in it and the law which prescribeth it, and do bewail our daily
   failings. Many do some external works of obedience, but not with an
   inward delight, but out of custom or compulsion. God never hath our
   heart till he hath our delight, till we willingly abstain from what may
   displease him, and cheerfully practise what he requireth of us; when it
   is grateful to obey, and all pleasures to this are nothing worth.

SERMON LIV.

   My hands also will I lift up to thy commandments, which I have loved
   and I will meditate in, thy statutes. Ver. 48.

   IN the morning we opened one profession of David's respect to the word
   of God; now follows another. He would employ all his faculties about
   the commandments of God, which is his last argument: his mind, for here
   is meditation promised; his heart, for here is love asserted; his
   tongue, for that is his original request which occasioned all these
   professions; and here his hands, his life, My hands also will I lift
   up,' &c. Observe--

   1. The ground or cause of his respect to the commandments of God, in
   that clause, which I have loved.

   2. A double effect, I will lift up my hands to thy commandments, and I
   will meditate in thy statutes.

   Lifting up the palms or hands is a phrase of various use.

   1. For praying: Ps. xxviii. 2, Hear the voice of my supplications when
   I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands towards thy holy oracle;' Lam.
   ii. 19, Lift up thy hands towards him, for the life of thy young
   children,' &c.; Hab. iii. 10, The deep uttered his voice, and lift up
   his hands on high.' Thence the apostle, 1 Tim. ii. 8, I will,
   therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without
   wrath and doubting.'

   2. For blessing others. Aaron lift up his hands towards the people, and
   blessed them. Or for praising or blessing God: Ps. cxxxiv. 2, Lift up
   your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord:' so Ps. lxiii. 4, Thus
   will I bless thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in thy name.'

   3. For swearing or vowing: Gen. xiv. 22, I have lift up my hand to the
   most high God,' that is, sworn; so Rev. x. 5, the angel lift up his
   hand and swore.' So of God: Ps. cvi. 26, Therefore he lifted up his
   hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,' that is, swore
   they should not enter into his rest.'

   4. For setting about any action, especially of weight: Gen. xli. 44,
   Without thee shall no man lift up his hand,' that is, attempt or do
   anything; so Ps. x. 12, Arise, O Lord, lift up thine hand; forget not
   the poor,' that is, set to thine active hand for their assistance; so
   Heb. xii. 12, Lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees,'
   that is, set actively and vigorously about the Christian task. To this
   rank may be also referred what is said Mat. vi. 3, Let not thy left
   hand know what thy right hand doeth.' The hand is the instrument of
   action.

   Now all these senses might be applied to the present place.

   [1.] Praying for God's grace to perform them.

   [2.] Blessing God, as we do for our daily food, giving thanks for them.

   [3.] Vowing or promising under an oath a constant obedience to them.
   But the commandments are not the proper object to which the acts of
   praying, blessing, swearing are directed, but God. It is not, I will
   lift up my band to God, but thy commandments.' We ought, indeed to
   bless God and praise God for the blessings we receive by his word, to
   vow our duty; but lifting up the hand in all these senses is to God.
   Therefore--

   [4.] Here it meaneth no more but I will apply myself to the keeping of
   them, or set vigorously about it, put my hands to the practising of thy
   law with all earnestness, endeavouring to do what therein is enjoined.
   Two points:--

   Doct. 1. That it is not enough to approve or commend the commandments
   of God, but we must carefully set ourselves to the observance of them.

   Doct. 2. Whosoever would do so must use great study and meditation.

   Doct. 1. That it is not enough to approve or commend the commandments
   of God, but we must carefully set ourselves to the practice of them.

   1. Hearing without doing is disapproved: Deut. iv. 5, I have taught you
   good statutes and judgments, that ye might do so:' Deut. v. 1, Hear,
   Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day,
   that ye may learn them, and do them.' Otherwise we deceive our own
   souls: James i. 22, But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,
   deceiving your own souls.' We put a paralogism on ourselves, build on a
   sandy foundation: Mat. vii. 26, Every one that heareth these sayings of
   mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man that
   built his house upon the sand.'

   2. Knowledge without practice is not right: Luke xii. 47, 48, He that
   knoweth his master's will, and prepareth not himself to do it, shall be
   beaten with many stripes.' Better never known, if not done, for then
   they do but aggravate our guilt and increase our punishment.

   3. Our love is not right unless it endeth in practice. A Christian's
   love, to whatever object it be directed, must be an unfeigned love. If
   God, if the brethren, if the word of God, those words must ever sound
   in our ears, 1 John iii. 18, My little children, love not in word and
   tongue, but in deed and in truth.' Do you love the word of God? Do it
   not in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth.

   4. Our delight is not right; the pleasure is but an airy, idle, and
   speculative delight, unless it set us about the practice of all holy
   obedience unto God, making it the design and business of our lives to
   exercise ourselves unto godliness. That showeth the reality of your
   delight, when you come under the power of the truth, and are absolutely
   governed by it; for then you delight in them aright as mysteries of
   godliness. The Lord complaineth of them that had a delight in the
   prophet, His voice was as pleasing to them as a minstrel; they hear the
   words, and do them not,' Ezek. xxxiii. 32. They may delight in sublime
   strains of doctrine or flourishes of wit. Demosthenes had made a
   plausible speech to the Athenians; Phocion told them that the
   cypress-tree is goodly and fair, but beareth no fruit There may be
   flourishes of wit, but no food for hungry consciences.

   5. Our commendation is not right unless it endeth in practice. Many may
   discourse of the ways of God, never speak of them but with
   commendation, but they do not lift their hands to this blessed work:
   they show some love to God's commandments, but when it cometh to
   action, their hands are remiss and faint. Christ refuseth that respect
   of bare naked commendation: Luke xi. 27, 28, Blessed is the womb that
   bare thee, and the paps that thou hast sucked. Menounge, yea, rather,
   blessed is he that heareth the word of God, and keepeth it.' We are
   disciples of that master that did both teach and do: Acts i. 1, The
   former treatise have I made, Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both
   to do and teach.' Of the Pharisees it is said, They say, and do not,'
   Mat. xxiii. 2, 3. But in Christians there must be saying and doing:
   James ii. 12, So speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
   law of liberty.' We shall be rewarded, not for speaking well, but for
   doing, hands lifted up.

   Well, then, nothing remains but practising duties that are pressed upon
   you on the first opportunity. Not he that heareth, understandeth,
   loveth, delighteth, commendeth, but he that keepeth instruction,' it
   is, is in the way of life,' Prov. x. 17. He that submitteth himself to
   be guided by God's word, he is going the right way to eternal life and
   happiness. But to set home this point more fully, I shall inquire--

   1. What kind of observance we must address ourselves unto.

   2. Why we must thus lift up our hands, or address ourselves to our
   duty.

   First, How, for the manner, must we lift up our hands, or what doing is
   necessary?

   1. It must be universal: Herod did many things,' Mark vi. 20. Partial
   reformation in outward things will not serve the turn. In sundry
   particulars men may yield to the word of God, but in others deny their
   obedience; as in some cheap observances, or such duties as cross not
   our lusts; but David would lift up his hands to the commandments,
   without distinction and limitation. Many, this they will do, and that
   they will not do; and so do not obey God's will, but their own: Ps.
   cxix. 6, Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
   commandments:' Luke i. 6, And they were both righteous before God,
   walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.'

   2. This doing must be serious and diligent. Every Christian must bend
   the powers of his soul, and lay out the first of his care and labour,
   in his obedience unto God: Phil. ii. 12, Work out your salvation with
   fear and trembling:' this is not a work to be done by the bye; but with
   the greatest care and solicitude.

   3. This must be our settled and our ordinary practice. To lift up our
   hands now and then is not enough, to do a good thing once, or rarely.
   No; we must make religion our business. The lifting of the hands to
   God's commandments is not a thing done accidentally, occasionally, or
   in a fit of zeal, but our trade and course of life: Acts xxiv. 16, I
   exercise myself in this, to have a conscience void of offence both
   towards God and men, en touto asko. This was the employment of his
   life.

   4. We must persevere or continue with patience in well-doing, not
   withstanding discouragements: Heb. xii. 12, Wherefore lift up the hands
   which hang down, and the feeble knees.' There must be no fainting,
   whatever discouragements happen; as there was a great deal of do to
   hold up Moses's hands in Israel's conflict with Amalek: Exod. xvii. 11,
   12, As long as he held up the rod of God, Israel prevailed; but Moses'
   hands were heavy;' a sign of many infirmities, not able long to endure
   in spiritual exercise; for though the spirit be willing, yet the flesh
   is weak.' But faith should still hold up our hands.

   5. This lifting up the hands, or alacrious diligence, should flow from
   a right principle, and that is faith and love.

   [1.] Faith, or a sound persuasion of God's love to us in Christ, that
   keepeth us doing: Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you, by the mercies of God,
   that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
   God, which is your reasonable service;' and Titus ii. 11, 12, The grace
   of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us
   that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
   righteously, and godly in this present world.' Thankfulness to God is
   the great principle of gospel obedience.

   [2.] Love: Thy commandments, which I have loved:' 2 Cor. v. 14, The
   love of Christ constraineth us.' Nothing holdeth up the hands in a
   constant obedience to God and performance of his will so much as a
   thorough love to God and his ways. Faith begets love, and love
   obedience. These are the true principles of all Christian actions.

   6. This lifting up of the hands imports a right end. Commanded work
   must be done to commanded ends, else we lift up our hands to our own
   work. Now, the true end is the glory of God: 1 Cor. x. 31, Whether,
   therefore, ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
   God;' and Phil. i. 11, Being filled with the fruits of righteousness,
   which are by Christ Jesus, unto the glory and praise of God.' God's
   glory must be our main scope, not any by-respect of our own. Well,
   then, this is lifting up our hands to the commandments of God, not
   doing one good work, but all; and this with a serious diligence, in our
   ordinary practice, continuing therein with patience, whatever
   oppositions we meet with; and this out of faith, or a sincere belief of
   the gospel, and fervent love, and an unfeigned respect to God's glory.

   Secondly, Why such a lifting up the hands, or serious addressing
   ourselves to our duty, is necessary? My answer shall be given in a
   fourfold respect--God, ordinances, graces, and the Christian, who is to
   give an account of himself unto God.

   1. God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: Father, as a lawgiver; Son, as a
   redeemer and head of the renewed estate; Holy Ghost, as our sanctifier.

   [1.] God the Father, who in the mystery of redemption is represented as
   our lawgiver and sovereign lord, and will be not only known and
   worshipped, but served by a full and entire obedience: 1 Chron. xxviii.
   9, And thou, Solomon, my son, know the God of thy father, and serve him
   with a perfect heart and a willing mind.' He hath given us a law not to
   be trampled upon or despised, but observed and kept; and that not by
   fear or force, but of a ready mind. Though there be an after provision
   of grace for those that break his law because of the frailty of the
   creature, yet if we presume upon that indulgence, and sin much that God
   may pardon much, we may render ourselves incapable of that grace; for
   the more presumptuously wicked we are, the less pleasing unto God. The
   governor of the world should not be affronted upon the pretence of a
   remedy which the gospel offered; for this is to sin that grace may
   abound, than which wicked imagination nothing is more contrary to
   gospel grace: Rom. vi. 1, What shall we say then? shall we continue in
   sin that grace may abound? God forbid.' To check this conceit, God
   deterreth men from greater sins, as more difficult to be pardoned than
   less; they shall not have so quick and easy a pardon of them as of
   others; nay, he deterreth men from going on far in sin, either as to
   the intensive increase or the continuance in time, lest he cut them off
   and withdraw his grace, and pardon them not at all. Therefore he
   biddeth them to call upon him while he is near,' Isa. lv. 6; not to
   harden their hearts, while it is called to-day,' Heb. iii. 7, 8.
   Therefore, if we should only consider God as our lord and lawgiver, we
   should earnestly betake ourselves to obedience.

   [2.] If we consider the Son as redeemer and head of the renewed estate,
   he standeth upon obedience: Heb. v. 9, he is the author of eternal life
   to them that obey him.' As he hath taken the commandments into his own
   hand, he insisteth upon practice, if his people will enjoy his favour:
   John xv. 10, If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as
   I have kept my father's commandments, and abide in his love.' He hath
   imposed a yoke upon his disciples, and hath service for them to do: he,
   being a pattern and mirror of obedience, expects the like from his
   people. He fully performed what was enjoined him to do as the surety of
   believers, and therefore expecteth we should be as faithful to him as
   he hath been to God. So John xiv. 21, He that hath my commandments, and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.' No love of Christ should
   encourage us to cast off duty, but continue it. He taketh himself to be
   honoured when his people obey: 2 Thes. i. 11, 12, Wherefore also we
   pray always for you, that God would count you worthy of this calling,
   and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith
   with power, that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
   you.' The work of faith is obedience, and Christ is dishonoured and
   reproached when they disobey: Luke vi. 46, Why call ye me Lord, Lord,
   and do not the things which I say?'

   [3.] The Spirit is given to make graces operative, to flow forth: John
   iv. 14, Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall
   never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a
   well of water springing up unto everlasting life:' and John vii. 38, He
   that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
   water: this spake he of his Spirit, which they that believe in him
   should receive.' Therefore, if we have an inward approbation of the
   ways of God, unless we lift up our hands, we resist his work.

   2. With respect to ordinances: They are all means, and means are
   imperfect without their end. Things pro`s a'llo are of no use, unless
   that other thing be accomplished for which they serve: as he is a
   foolish workman that contents himself with having tools, and never
   worketh; for tools are in order to work, and all the means of grace are
   in order to practice. We read, hear, meditate, to understand our duty.
   Now if we never put it in practice, we use means to no end and purpose:
   Hear and live;' Hear and do.' The word layeth out work for us; it was
   not ordained for speculation only, but as a rule of duty to the
   creatures: therefore, if we are to hear, read, meditate, we must also
   lift up our hands.

   3. All graces are imperfect till they end in action, for they were not
   given us for idle and useless habits. Knowledge, to know merely that we
   may know, is curiosity and idle speculation. So Ps. cxi. 10, A good
   understanding have all they that do his commandments;' Jer. xxii. 16,
   He judgeth the cause of the poor and the needy. Was not this to know
   me? saith the Lord.' That is true knowledge that produceth its effect.
   So James ii. 22, By works faith is made perfect;' faith hath produced
   its end. So love is perfected in keeping the commandments: 1 John ii.
   5, Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected;'
   as all things are perfect when they attain their end and their
   consummate estate. The plant is perfect when it riseth up into stalk,
   and flower, and seed; so these graces.

   4. The person or Christian is judged not only by what is believed, but
   what is done; not by what is approved, but what is practised. Many
   profess faith and love; but if it be not verified in practice, they are
   not accepted with God: 1 Peter i. 17, If ye call on the Father, who
   without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work;' and
   Rev. xx. 12, I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
   books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of
   life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written
   in the books, according to their works.' God will judge men according
   to their works, and what they have done in the flesh, whether it be
   good or evil: John v. 29, They that have done good shall rise to the
   resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection
   of condemnation.' The redeemed sinner shall have his trial and
   judgment.

   Use 1. For the disproof of two sorts--preachers and professors.

   1. Preachers: if they be strict in doctrine and loose in practice, do
   they lift their hands to God's commandments? No; they are like the
   Pharisees, who bind heavy burdens upon others, and do not touch them
   with their own little finger,' Mat. xxiii. 4. It is not enough to lift
   up our voice in recommending, but we must lift up our hands in
   practising, lest like a mark-stone, they show others the way to heaven,
   but walk not in it themselves, and contribute nothing of help by their
   examples.

   2. Professors.

   [1.] That approve the word only. There may be an idle naked
   approbation: Rom. ii. 18, Thou knowest his will, and approvest the
   things that are most excellent, being instructed out of the law.' Video
   meliora proboque; they esteem these things better, but their hearts
   incline them to what is evil, and their reason is a slave to appetite.

   [2.] That commend as well as approve: Rom. ii. 20, Who hast a form of
   knowledge, and of the truth in the law,' but without action, and
   practice. Have many, good words; their voice Jacob's but their hands
   Esau's: Ps. l. 16, 17, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or
   to take my covenant in thy mouth, since thou hatest instruction, and
   castest my words behind me?' It pertaineth not to thee to profess
   religion, since thou dost not practise it, to commend the law which
   thou observest not, or to profess love to what thou dost not obey.

   Use 2. Is to press you to lift up your hands, and to obey and do the
   things which God hath prescribed in his word. Do not rest in the
   notional part of religion. That which will approve you to God is not a
   sharp wit, or a firm memory, or a nimble tongue, but a ready practice.
   God expecteth to be glorified by his creatures both in word and deed;
   and therefore heart, and tongue, and hand, and all should be employed.
   I will urge you with but two reasons:--

   1. How easy it is to deceive ourselves with a fond love, a naked ap
   probation, or good words, without bringing things to this real proof,
   whether the truth that we approve, esteem, and commend, have a real
   dominion over and influence upon our practice! 1 John ii. 4, He that
   saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the
   truth is not in him;' James i. 22, Be ye doers of the word, not hearers
   only, deceiving your own souls.' Respect to God and his word is a true
   evidence of a gracious heart. Now, how shall we know this respect real,
   but by our constant and uniform practice?

   2. That it is not so easy to deceive God: he cannot be mocked with a
   vain show, for he looketh to the bottom and spring of all things: 1
   Chron. xxviii. 9, And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy
   father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind;
   for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
   imaginations of the thoughts.' He searcheth our hearts, knoweth our
   inward disposition, whether firm, strong, or productive of obedience.
   Now, to him you are to approve yourselves, and he will not be mocked
   with lying pretences and excuses: Gal. vi. 7, Be not deceived; God is
   not mocked.' The all-seeing God cannot be blinded: he knoweth our
   thoughts afar off, and seeth all things in their causes; much more can
   he judge of effects. Therefore, whatsoever illuminations we pretend
   unto, if we do not live in the obedience of the commands of
   self-denial, humility, justice, patience, faith, and love, he can soon
   find us out. If our actions do not correspond to our profession, it is
   a practical he, which the Lord can easily find out.

   Doct. 2. Whosoever would lift up his hands to God's commandments, and
   seriously address himself to a course of obedience, must use much study
   and meditation. On the one side, non-advertency to heavenly doctrine is
   the bane of many: Mat. xiii. 19, When any one heareth the word of the
   kingdom, and understandeth it not,' me sunientos, non advertit animum,
   then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in
   his heart.' And so James i. 23, 24, If any be a hearer of the word, and
   not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass; for
   he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth
   what manner of man he was. God s great complaint of his people is that
   they will not consider: Isa i. 3, The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass
   his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not
   consider.' So Jer. viii. 6, I hearkened and heard, but they spake not
   aright; no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, what have I
   done?' The heathens have commended such recollection. On the other
   side, the scripture recommendeth meditation, as one great help to
   obedience. Lydia's conversion is described by attendancy: Acts xvi. 14,
   The Lord opened her heart, that she attended unto the things which were
   spoken by Paul:' because that is the first step to it; minding,
   choosing, prosecuting. So the man that will benefit by the word of God
   is he, James i. 25, That looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
   continueth therein;' that is, abideth in the view of these truths; for
   a glance never converted or warmed the heart of any man: This man being
   not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word, this man shall be
   blessed in his deed.' Now, more particularly, why meditation is
   necessary:--

   1. To know the mind of God and understand our duty. A superficial
   knowledge hath no efficacy and hold upon us; therefore, by deep
   meditation, search and study, we come to be more thoroughly acquainted
   with the mind of God revealed in his word. We are bidden, Prov. ii. 4,
   to dig for knowledge as for silver.' Mines do not lie on the surface,
   but in the bowels of the earth. Every day we should get more knowledge:
   Rom. xii. 2, Be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, that ye
   may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God;' and
   Eph. v. 17, Be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord
   is.' Now we cannot know this without a serious search and inquiry into
   the rule of duty: there must be an accurate search; spiritual knowledge
   will not drop into our mouths. There are many clouds of ignorance and
   folly that yet hover in the minds of men, and they are dispelled more
   and more by a sound study of the scriptures.

   2. To keep up a fresh remembrance of our duty. Oblivion and
   inconsideration is a kind of ignorance for the time. Though we
   habitually know a thing, yet we do not actually know a thing till we
   consider of it: Eccles. v. 1, They consider not that they do evil:' so
   Hosea vii. 2, They consider not in their hearts that I remember all
   their wickedness.' That which we consider is always before us; but that
   which we consider not is forgotten, laid by, and the notions which we
   have about them are as it were laid asleep, they work not. But now
   frequent meditation keepeth these things alive.

   3. Meditation is necessary to enkindle our affections. Affections are
   stirred by thoughts, as thoughts by objects. The truth cannot come home
   to our hearts till we think of it again and again. We have no other
   natural way to raise affection; and we must not think that grace
   worketh like a charm, in a way contrary to the instituted order of
   nature. No; the heart of man must be besieged with frequent and
   powerful thoughts before it will yield to God and give entertainment to
   his truth and ways. There is no coming at the heart but by the mind;
   and the mind must be serious in what it represents to gain the heart;
   that is, we must meditate. The devil watcheth our postures; he seeketh
   to catch these thoughts out of our mind as soon as he seeth that we
   begin to be serious, Mat. xiii. 19.

   4. Meditation is necessary to show our love: I will lift up my hands
   also to thy commandments, which I have loved, and I will meditate in
   thy statutes;' Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in
   his law doth he meditate day and night;' Ps. cxix. 47, And I will
   delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.' The mind will
   muse upon what we love. As thoughts stir affections, so affections stir
   up thoughts; for in all moral things there is a kthkloge'nesis. A
   pleasing object will be much revolved in our mind, and frequently
   thought of.

   The use is for direction to us. When you have heard the word, remember
   what you hear, and apply it to yourselves by serious inculcative
   thoughts. So when you read the word, do not only understand it, but
   think of it again and again: Deut. xxxii. 46, Set your hearts to all
   the words which I testify among you this day,' saith Moses to the
   Israelites. So Christ: Luke ix. 44, Let these sayings sink into your
   hearts.' Truths never go to the quick of the affections but by serious
   and ponderous thoughts. You will not lift up your hands till the truth
   sink into the heart. You read chapters, hear sermon after sermon; they
   do not stir you, or it is but a little, for a fit, like a man that hath
   been a little warming himself by the fire, and goeth away, and is
   colder than he was before. O Christian! this means is not to be
   neglected, no more than reading and hearing, because of its great use,
   both for first conversion, and continual quickening.

   1. For first conversion. A man cometh to himself by serious thoughts of
   those great and important truths which are delivered in the word of
   God: Luke xv. 17, And when he came to himself, he said,' &c.; Ps. xxii.
   27, All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord;'
   Ps. cxix. 59, I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy
   testimonies.'

   2. For continual quickening. Musing maketh the fire burn. The greatest
   things will not move us if we do not think of them: Rom. viii. 31, What
   shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against
   us?' Job v. 27, Lo, this we have searched, so it is; hear it, and know
   thou it for thy good.' The benefit of sound doctrine consists in the
   application thereof by the hearers. When men have spent their time and
   strength to find a good lesson for us, shall not we think of it?
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LV.

   Remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to
   hope.--Ver. 49.

   IN the words observe--

   1. His prayer and humble petition to God, remember thy word. God is
   said to remember when he doth declare by the effect that he doth
   remember. He sometimes seemingly forgets his promise, that is, to
   appearance carrieth himself as one that doth forget.

   2. His argument is taken--

   [1.] From his interest, thy servant.

   [2.] From his trust and hope, which is expressed--

   (1.) As warranted.

   (2.) As caused.

   (1.) As warranted by his word; that gave him ground of hope and comfort

   (2.) As caused by his influence, Upon which thou hast caused me to
   hope. The word his warrant, the Spirit his anchor. Would God raise up
   such a hope merely to defeat it? The word concurred to this hope, as it
   offered--

   (1st.) A command to believe.

   (2d.) The promise of the eternal and immutable God to build upon. The
   influence of his grace concurred; for he that maketh the offer in the
   word doth also work faith in the believer, and inclineth his heart to
   apply the promise and trust in it; for faith is the gift of God,' Eph.
   ii. 8. In short, here is a promise believed and pleaded; and both
   confirm our faith in the fulfilling and granting of it.

   Doct. That believers may humbly challenge God upon his word, and seek
   the full performance of what he hath promised.

   This point, that it may be managed with respect to this text, I shall
   give you these considerations:--

   1. That God delighteth to promise mercy before he accomplish it; which
   showeth these things:--

   [1.] His abundant love. God's heart is so kindly affected to his people
   that he cannot stay till the accomplishment of things, but he must tell
   us aforehand what he meaneth to do for us: Isa. xlii. 9, Before they
   spring forth, I will tell you of them;' long before there was any sight
   of such things, or means that might produce them: so that his promise
   is an eruption and overflow of his love.

   [2.] His care for our security; for by his promise he giveth his people
   a holdfast upon him, as he maketh himself a debtor to them by his own
   promise, who was otherwise free before such engagement to poor
   creatures: Ps. lxxxix, 34, My covenant will I not break, nor alter the
   thing that is gone out of my lips' The word is gone out of his lips,
   not to be recalled, nor reversed. The promises are as so many bonds,
   wherein he stands bound to us; and these bonds may be put in suit, and
   his people have liberty and confidence to ask what he hath promised to
   them. Austin saith of his mother, Chirographa tua injiciebat tibi
   Domine--Lord, she showed thy own bond and hand writing. It is a mighty
   argument in prayer when we can plead that we ask no more than God hath
   promised.

   2. That there is usually some time of delay between making the promise
   and fulfilling the promise; for therefore God promiseth, because he
   meaneth to do us good, but not presently. And this delay is not for
   want of kindness, or out of any backwardness to our good; for so it is
   said, he will not tarry: Hab. ii. 3, Though it tarry, wait for it,
   because it will surely come, it will not tarry.' Nor out of ignorance,
   as not knowing the fittest time to help his people; for his waiting is
   guided by judgment: Isa. xxx. 18, He waiteth that he may be gracious;
   for he is a God of judgment;' he will take hold of the fittest season
   or occasion. Not from forgetfulness of his promise; for he is ever
   mindful of his holy covenant,' Ps. cxi. 5. Not from any mutability of
   nature or change of counsel; for he is Jehovah, that changeth not: Mal.
   iii. 6, I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
   consumed.' He hath a due foresight of all possible difficulties, and
   needeth not to alter his counsels. Not from impotency and weakness, as
   if he could not execute what he had promised, as the sons of Zeruiah
   were too hard for David, 2 Sam. iii. 39; all things are at the beck and
   signification of his will. But (1.) Partly with respect to his own
   glory, he will do things in their proper season: Eccles. iii. 11,
   Everything is beautiful in its time.' This is the wise providence of
   God in the government of the world, that every thing is brought forth
   in its proper season, and in the time when it is most fit. God humbleth
   and God exalteth his people in due time: 1 Peter v. 6, Humble
   yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
   you in due time.' So it is said of their enemies: Deut. xxxii. 35,
   Their foot shall slide in due time.' Summer and winter must succeed in
   their seasons. (2.) With respect to us, God will try our faith, whether
   we can stay on his word, and hug it, and embrace it, till the blessing
   come. As it is said of the patriarchs aspasamenoi, Heb. xi. 13, They
   embraced the promises;' Ps. lvi. 4, In God I will praise his word; I
   have put my trust in the Lord; I will not fear what flesh can do unto
   me.' During this time we may be exercised with divers troubles and
   difficulties, so that to appearance God seemeth to forget his promises;
   and this he doth--

   [1.] Partly to try our faith to the utmost, to see if we can trust and
   depend upon God for things which we see not, nor are likely to see.
   Faith, in the general, is a dependence upon God for something that
   lieth out of sight. Now, when the object is not only out of sight, but
   all that is seen and felt seemeth to contradict our hopes, and God
   seemeth to put us off, and we meet with many a rebuke of our
   confidence, instead of an answer, as the woman of Canaan that came to
   Christ at first meeteth not with a word, then his speech more
   discourageth than his silence: Mat. xv. 26, It is not meet to take the
   children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.' She turneth this rebuke
   into an encouragement: ver. 27, Truth, Lord! yet the dogs, eat of the
   crumbs which fall from their master's table;' ver. 28, Then Jesus
   answered and said unto her, O woman! great is thy faith; be it unto
   thee even as thou wilt.' Many times we come and pray for blessings
   promised, and the oracle is dumb and silent. Though God love the
   supplicant, yet he will not seem to take notice of his desires, but
   will humble him to the dust. Now, to pick an answer out of God's
   silence, and a gracious answer out of his rebukes, showeth great faith.
   Job saith, chap. xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him.'
   Faith supports us under the greatest pressures; when God seemeth to
   deal like an enemy, yet even then trusts in God as a friend, and that
   his dispensations will never give his word the lie.

   [2.] To try our patience as well as our faith. God's dearest children
   are not admitted to the enjoyment of the mercies promised presently:
   Heb. vi. 12, Be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith
   and patience inherit the promises.' And Heb. x. 36, Ye have need of
   patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the
   promise.' We must first do, and sometimes suffer, the will of God. The
   promises are to come, and at a great distance. And if we hope for that
   we see not,' and enjoy not, then do we with patience wait for it,' Rom.
   viii. 25. But especially is patience tried when we meet with
   oppositions, difficulties, dangers, many things done, many things
   suffered, before we can attain what we hope for. Now, quietly to wait
   God's leisure is a great trial of our patience: Our times are always
   present with us, when God's time is not come. A hungry stomach would
   have meat ere it be sodden or roasted, and a sickish appetite must have
   green fruit; but to wait, like the husband man, in all seasons and
   weathers, till the corn ripen; and to persevere in hoping and praying,
   that is that which God requires.

   [3.] Our love, though we be not feasted with felt comforts, nor bribed
   with present satisfaction and benefits in hand. God will try the
   deportment of his children, whether they will adhere to him when he
   seemeth to cast them off. It is not said, In the way of thy mercies,'
   but, In the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; the
   desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee,'
   Isa. xxvi. 8. Love for himself, without any present benefit from him,
   yea, when kept under sore judgments and deep distresses.

   [4.] To enlarge our desires, that we may have the greater sense of our
   necessities, and value for the blessings promised. A sack that is
   stretched out holdeth the more. Delay increaseth importunity: Ask, and
   ye shall have; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
   unto you,' Mat. vii. 7; Luke xi. 8, Though he will not rise and give
   him because he is his friend, yet dia` ten anaideian, because of his
   importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.' And
   things promised being asked, and at length obtained, are the more
   valued.

   3. That if we yet continue our faith, and heartily believe God upon his
   word, it is a great encouragement in waiting for the thing promised;
   for to believe is a qualification. There are in the word of God
   promises that we may believe, and then promises because we do believe;
   promises to invite faith and hope, and then promises because we believe
   in God and hope in his word; promises for faith, and to faith. As for
   instance, God hath promised to be a defence unto his people: Zech. ii.
   5, I the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about her, and will
   be the glory in the midst of her.' Now see how David pleadeth: Ps.
   lvii. 1, Be merciful unto me, God, be merciful unto me; for my soul
   trusteth in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
   refuge, until these calamities be overpast.' When once we believe, then
   we have a claim: Isa. xxvi. 3, Thou keepest him in perfect peace whose
   mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.' Trust giveth us a
   fresh claim or new interest: Ps. lxxxvi. 2, O thou my God, save thy
   Servant that trusteth in thee.' God will not disappoint a trusting
   soul. An ingenuous man will not fail his friend if he rely on him. We
   count this the strongest bond we lay upon another, to be faithful and
   mindful of us: I trust you, that you will do this for me. How much more
   will God do so,--

   [1.] For his own honour, to show himself faithful, willing, and able to
   succour his people in their distresses. This is the reproach cast upon
   the worshippers of idols, that they call upon those things which cannot
   help them nor relieve them in their straits: Judges x. 14, Go to the
   gods whom ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the day of
   tribulation.' When you trust God, the honour of his Godhead lieth at
   stake. By trust you own him for a God: Jonah i. 5, Then the mariners
   were afraid, and cried every man upon his god.' By making good your
   trust he showeth himself to be a God, that they do not seek to a vain
   help.

   [2.] With a condescension to his people. Nothing goeth so near their
   hearts as a disappointment of their hope in God. This will mightily
   damp their spirits, when God spits in their faces, and seemeth to
   reject their prayers: Ps. xxv. 2, O my God, I trust in thee, let me not
   be ashamed; yea, let none of them that wait on thee be ashamed; but let
   them be ashamed which transgress without a cause.' To have hopes fail
   which were invited and drawn forth by promises is a great temptation.

   [3.] With respect to their enemies, who will be sure to cast this in
   their teeth, if the God in whom they trusted should not send help from
   his holy place. You will find God's servants often mocked for their
   trust: Ps. xxii. 8, He trusted in the Lord; let him now deliver him,
   seeing he delighted in him.' Christ himself was not free from the lash
   of profane tongues, he was mocked for his dependence on his Father:
   Mat. xxvii. 43, He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will
   have him.' The world counts faith but a fancy. Now if God should deny
   the things promised to his people, it would seem to countenance the
   slanders of their enemies. Wherefore do the children of God expose
   themselves to difficulties, and all manner of hard usages, but because
   of their hope in God? 1 Tim. iv. 10, Therefore we suffer reproach,
   because we trust in the living God;' for that reason, because they look
   for great things from God; therefore God hath a great respect for them
   that trust in him.

   4. This trust must be pleaded in prayer.

   [1.] Because prayer is one of the means by which God hath decreed to
   fulfil his promises; and therefore we must obtain mercies in his own
   appointed way. God saith, I will do thus and thus for you: Ezek. xxxvi.
   37, But I will be inquired after by the house of Israel for this very
   thing.' God will do it, but prayer must give a lift; he will be sought
   to: Jer. xxix. 11, 12, I know the thoughts which I think to wards you,
   saith the Lord; thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
   expected end,' that is, such an end as yourselves hope for and desire;
   then shall ye call upon me, and go, and pray to me, and I will hearken
   unto you,' that is, you must address and set yourselves seriously to
   this work. When the promise is urged by the believer, it will be
   performed by God. So when Daniel understood by the books and writings
   of the prophets that the time was come wherein God had promised to
   deliver his people, then he falleth a-praying in a serious manner, Dan.
   ix. 3. When God hath a mind to work, then he sets the spirit of prayer
   awork, for he will have all things accomplished in his own way.

   [2.] Because he hath put this office upon his people, that they are to
   be his remembrancers at the throne of grace: Isa. lxii. 6, Ye that make
   mention of the Lord, keep not silence:' it is in the margin, Ye that
   are the Lord's remembrancers,' whose office it is to be constantly
   minding God, and soliciting him in the behalf of his church. Public
   remembrancers are the officers of his church; but every Christian is a
   private remembrancer, to put God in mind of his promise. Not that God
   is subject to forgetfulness, as man is, who hath need of such minders;
   but he will be sought and solicited for the performance of his gracious
   promises. We have an advocate in heaven, but there are remembrancers
   upon earth. We come as David here, Remember thy word unto thy servants,
   on which thou hast caused us to hope.'

   5. We are the more encouraged because God, that made the promise, doth
   also give the faith; for he pleadeth two things the grant of the
   promise, and the gift of faith. Reasons:--

   [1.] God would not deceive us. Would he raise a confidence to
   disappoint us? In such a case we might say, as the prophet Jeremiah,
   chap. xx. 7, Thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived:' the words seem
   to intrench upon the honour of God. In the general, I answer--They were
   spoken by the prophet in a passion. Others soften them by another
   rendering and interpretation, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was
   persuaded:' that is, to undertake the prophetical office, of which I
   was nothing forward of myself, but averse thereunto, yet found it more
   troublesome than I expected. But put it with a supposition, If I be
   deceived, thou hast deceived me,' there is nothing inconvenient God had
   told him he would make him as a brazen wall; God had raised a faith and
   hope in him to be borne out in his work. Now, if God hath specially
   excited your faith, it is not a foolish imagination or vain
   expectation, like as of them that dream; it is God's word you build
   upon, and it is by a faith of God's operation; he raiseth it in us.

   [2.] The prayer of faith is the voice of the Spirit, and God heareth
   the voice of the Spirit always, who maketh requests kata Theon,
   according to the will of God:' Rom. viii. 27, He that searcheth and
   trieth the hearts, knoweth what is a groan of the Spirit,' what is a
   fancy of our own, what is a confidence raised in us by the operation of
   his own Spirit. For there may be a mistaken faith, seemingly built upon
   the promises, whereas it is indeed built upon our own conceits. Now God
   is not bound to make that faith good. But when we can appeal to the
   searcher of hearts that it is a faith of his own working, surely we may
   have confidence.

   Now how shall we know that it is a faith of God's raising?

   1. If the promise be not mistaken, and we do not presume of that
   absolutely which God only hath promised conditionally, and with the
   limitations of his own glory and our good, which are joined to all
   promises which concern the present life. In temporal things, God
   exerciseth his children with great uncertainties, because he seeth it
   meet to prove our submission in these things, for our happiness lieth
   not in them. Those things wherein our happiness doth consist, as
   remission of sins and eternal life, are sure enough, and that is
   encouragement to a gracious heart: 2 Tim. iv. 18, God hath delivered me
   out of the mouth of the lion, and will deliver me from every evil
   work.' In the Old Testament, when God discovered less of heaven, he
   promised more of earth; but in the New Testament, where life and
   immortality are brought to light, we are told of many tribulations in
   our passage; yea, the eminent saints of the Old Testament, that had a
   clearer view of things to come than others had, were more exposed to
   the calamities of the present life, because God thought the sight of
   happiness to come sufficient to countervail their troubles; and if he
   would give them rest in another world, they might well endure the
   inconveniences of their pilgrimage: Heb. xi. 16, But now they desire a
   better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to
   be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.' The holy
   patriarchs left their country, flitted up and down upon this hope; but
   to us Christians the case is clear: Rom. viii. 18, For I reckon that
   the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be compared with
   the glory that shall be revealed in us;' 2 Cor. iv. 17, For this light
   affliction, that is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory.'

   2. When the qualification of the person is not clear, we must not
   absolutely promise ourselves the effect: Jonah iii. 9, Who can tell
   whether God will turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?'
   So Joel ii. 14, Who knoweth if he will return, and leave a blessing
   behind him?' In this clause I put believers who have sinned away their
   peace and assurance: 2 Sam. xii. 22, Who can tell if God will be
   gracious unto me, that the child may live?' He speaketh doubt fully;
   Zeph. ii. 3, It may be that ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's
   fierce anger;' Amos v. 15, Hate the evil and love the good; it may be
   the Lord God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.' In
   such cases the soul is divided between the expectation of mercy and the
   sense of their own deservings, and can speak neither the pure language
   of faith nor the pure language of unbelief--half Canaan, half Ashdod.
   There is a twilight in grace as well as in nature. God in these eases
   raiseth no other confidence, to heighten mercy, and try how we can
   venture upon God, and refer ourselves to his will, when we have any
   business for him to do for us: Mat. viii. 2, Lord, if thou wilt thou
   canst make me clean;' 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26, And the king said to Zadok,
   Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favour in the
   eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his
   habitation: but if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here
   am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.

   3. In the promises of spiritual and eternal mercies, when God's
   conditions are performed by us, we maybe confident, and must give glory
   to God in believing and being persuaded that he will fulfil them to us:
   2 Tim. i. 12, I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he
   is able to keep that which 1 have committed unto him against that day;'
   Rom. viii. 38, 39, For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord.' I am persuaded; there is no doubt: the stronger our confidence,
   the better.

   4. When God raiseth in our minds some particular express hope (as in
   some cases he may do) to these things that are of a temporal nature and
   are conditionally promised, and where our qualification is clear he
   will not disappoint us, 2 Cor. i. 12. Though the promises of temporal
   things have the limitation of the cross implied in them, and are to be
   understood in subordination to our eternal interest and God's glory,
   without which they would not be mercies but judgments, yet his usual
   course is to save, deliver, and supply them here: Ps. ix. 10, And they
   that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, Lord, hast
   not forsaken them that seek thee.' And when God by his Spirit doth
   particularly incline his people to hope for mercy from him, he will not
   fail their expectations. Where the qualification is uncertain, yet the
   faith of general mercy wrestleth against discouragements; as in the
   case of the woman of Canaan: there is the plea of a dog, and the plea
   of a child, in grievous temptations to fasten our selves upon God. God
   will make good the hope raised in them by his Spirit.

   Use. For direction, what to do in all our distresses, bodily and
   spiritual. Our necessities should lead us to the promise, and the
   promise to God.

   1. Be sure of your qualification; for David pleadeth here partly as the
   servant of God, and partly as a believer: first, Remember thy word unto
   thy servant;' and then, wherein thou hast caused me to hope.' There is
   a double qualification--with respect to the precept of subjection, with
   respect to the promise of dependence: the precept is before the
   promise. They have right to the promises, and may justly lay hold upon
   them, who are God's servants; they who apply themselves to obey his
   precepts, these only can regularly apply his promises. None can lay
   claim to rewarding grace but those that are partakers of his
   sanctifying grace. Clear that once, that you are God's servants, and
   then these promises, which are generally offered, are your own, no less
   than if your name were inserted in the promise, and written in the
   Bible. Let us remember our promises made to God, and then desire him to
   remember his promises to us. The next part of the qualification is, if
   you be believers, and can wait and depend upon God, though he seemeth
   to delay, and forget his promise: Our eyes must wait upon the Lord,
   until he have mercy upon us,' Ps. cxxiii. 2. The benefit of some
   promises droppeth, like the first ripe fruit, into the mouth of the
   eater; but others must be tarried for. It is said, Acts vii. 17, When
   the time of the promise drew night, which God had sworn to Abraham, the
   people grew and multiplied in Egypt.' The promise is recorded, Gen. xv.
   5, of multiplying his seed like the stars of heaven.' Abraham was
   seventy-five years old when the promise was made, a hundred years old
   when Isaac was born; when Jacob went into Egypt they were but seventy
   souls, but at their coming forth they were 603,550. Now, if faith wait,
   Isa. xxviii. 16, He that believeth maketh not haste:' Lam. iii. 26, It
   is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation
   of God;' Hosea xii. 6, Keep mercy and judgment, and wait on the Lord
   continually.' God delayeth because he would have us make use of faith.
   Real believers are such as have ventured upon God's word, denied
   themselves for the hopes offered therein: 1 Tim. iv. 10, Therefore we
   both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God:'
   Heb. vi. 10, God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of
   love, which ye have showed towards his name.' God's servants must wait
   for his promises with patience and self-denial: Rom. ii. 7, To them who
   by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and
   immortality, eternal life:' Luke viii. 15, Those in the good ground are
   they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it,
   and bring forth fruit with patience.'

   2. Then let us plead promises; let them not lie by us as a dead stock,
   but put them in suit, and put God in remembrance. When the
   accomplishment is delayed, it is a notable way of raising and
   increasing our confidence: 2 Sam. vii. 25, And now, Lord, the word that
   thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house, establish it for
   ever, and do as thou hast said.' So ver. 28, And now, Lord, thou art
   that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness
   unto thy servant.' So may we do with any promise of mercy and grace
   which God hath made with his people in his covenant.

SERMON LVI.

   This is my comfort in my affliction; for thy word hath quickened
   me.--Ver. 50.

   IN the former verse the man of God had complained of the delay of the
   promise, and that his hope was so long suspended; now in this verse he
   showeth what was his support, and did revive him during this delay and
   the sore afflictions which befell him in the meantime. The promise
   comforted him before performance came, This is my comfort in my
   affliction, thy word hath quickened me.'

   1. Observe here, the man of God had his afflictions; for we are not
   exempted from troubles, but comforted in troubles. God's promise, and
   hope therein, may occasion us much trouble and persecution in the
   world. Yet--

   2. This very promise which occasioneth the trouble is the ground of our
   support; for one great benefit which we have by the word is comfort
   against afflictions.

   3. This comfort which we have by the word is the quickening and life of
   the soul. The life of our soul is first received by the word, and still
   maintained by the same word: James i. 18, Of his own will begat he us
   with the word of truth;' 1 Peter i. 23, Being born again, not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
   liveth and abideth for ever.'

   Doct. That all other comforts in affliction are nothing to those
   comforts which we have from the word of God.

   David confirmeth it from experience; in his deepest pressures and
   afflictions, his soul was supported and enlivened by the word of God.
   The apostle Paul doctrinally asserts it: Rom. xv. 4, Whatsoever things
   were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through
   patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.' The general
   end of scripture is instruction; the special end is comfort and hope.
   Id agit iota scriptura, ut credamus in Deum (Luther)--the business and
   design of scripture is to bring us to believe in God, and to wait upon
   him for our salvation; to hope either for eternal life, which is the
   great benefit offered in the scriptures, or those intervening blessings
   which arc necessary by the way, and also adopted into the covenant. The
   reasons are taken--

   1. From the quality of those comforts which we have from the word of
   God.

   2. From the provision which the word hath made for our comfort.

   3. From the manner whereby this comfort is received.

   First, From the quality of those comforts which we receive from the
   word of God.

   1. It is a divine comfort: Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my
   thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.' In all the comforts
   we have, it is good to consider from whence it cometh. Is it God's
   comfort, or a fancy of our own? A comfort that is made up of our own
   fancies is like a spider's web, that is weaved out of its bowels, and
   is gone and swept away with the turn of a besom. But God's comfort is
   more durable and lasting; for then it floweth from the true fountain of
   comfort, upon whose smiles and frowns our happiness dependeth. Now
   God's comforts are such as God worketh, or God alloweth. Take them in
   either sense, they come in with a commanding or overpowering efficacy
   upon the soul. If God exciteth it by his Spirit, who is the comforter,
   Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put gladness into my heart.' There is little
   warmth in a fire of our own kindling: the Holy Ghost raiseth the heart
   to a higher degree of a delightful sense of the love of God than we can
   do by a bare natural act of our own understanding. Or whether it be of
   such comforts as God alloweth, if we have God's covenant for our
   comfort we have enough; no comfort like his comfort. In philosophy, man
   speaketh to us by the evidence of reason; in the scripture, God
   speaketh to us by way of sovereign authority: in his commands he
   interposeth his power and dominion; in his promises he empawneth his
   truth. And therefore scriptural comforts are God's comforts, and so
   more powerful and authoritative.

   2. It is a strong comfort: Heb. vi. 18, That the heirs of promise might
   have strong consolation,' ischuran paraklesin. Other comforts are weak
   and of little force; they are not affliction-proof, nor death-proof,
   nor judgment-proof; they cannot stand before a few serious and sober
   thoughts of the world to come; but this is strong comfort, that can
   support the soul, not only in the imagination and supposition of a
   trouble, when we see it at a distance, but when it is actually come
   upon us, how great soever it be. If we feel the cold hands of death
   ready to pluck out our hearts, and are summoned to appear before the
   bar of our judge, yet this comfort is not the more impeached; that
   which supported us in prosperity can support us in adversity; what
   supports in life can support us in death; for the comforts of the word
   endure for ever, and the covenant of God will not fail us, living or
   dying.

   3. It is a full comfort, both for measure and matter.

   [1.] Sometimes for the measure; the apostle speaketh of comforts
   abounding by Christ.' 2 Cor. i. 5, and Acts xiii. 52, The disciples
   were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost;' and the apostle Paul, 2
   Cor. vii. 4, huperperisseuomai te chara, I am filled with comfort, and
   am exceeding joyful in all your tribulations.' Paul and Silas could
   sing praises in the prison, and in the stocks, after they had been
   scourged and whipped, Acts xvi. 25. And our Lord Jesus Christ, when he
   took care, for our comfort, he took care that it might be a full
   comfort: John xv. 11, These things have I spoken, that my joy might
   remain in you, and that your joy might be full.' The joy of believers
   is a full joy, needing no other joy to be added to it; it is full
   enough to bear us out under all discouragements. If Christians would
   improve their advantages, they might by their full joy and cheerfulness
   entice carnal men, who are ensnared by the baits of the world and the
   delights of the flesh, once to come and try what comforts they might
   have in the bosom of Christ, and the lively expectation of the promised
   glory.

   [2.] For the matter; it is full, because of the comprehensiveness of
   those comforts which are provided for us. There is no sort of trouble
   for which the word of God doth not afford sufficient consolation; no
   strait can be so great, no pressure so grievous, but we have full
   consolation offered us in the promises against them all. We have
   promises of the pardon of all our sins, and promises of heaven itself;
   and what can we desire more? We have promises suited to every
   state--prosperity and adversity. What do we need, which we have not a
   promise of? Prosperity, that it shall not be our ruin, if we take it
   thankfully from God, and use it for God; for, to the pure all things
   are pure,' Titus i. 15. But especially for adversity, when we most need
   there are promises either of singular assistance or gracious
   deliverance. In short, the word of God assureth us of the gracious
   presence of God here in the midst of our afflictions,. and the eternal
   enjoyment of God hereafter; that he will be with us in our houses of
   clay, or we shall shortly be with him in his palace of glory; and so
   here is matter of full comfort.

   (1.) His presence with us in our afflictions: Ps. xci. 15, I will be
   with him in trouble;' and Isa. xliii. 2, When thou passest through the
   waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not
   overflow thee;' and many other places. Now if God be with us, why
   should we be afraid? Ps. xxiii. 4, When I walk through the valley of
   the shadow of death, I will not be afraid, for thou art with me;' and
   in many other places. We see in the body, if any member be hurt,
   thither presently runneth the blood to comfort the wounded part; the
   man himself, eye, tongue, and hand, is altogether employed about that
   part and wounded member, as if he were forgetful of all the rest. So we
   see in the family, if one of the children be sick, all the care and
   kindness of the mother is about that sick child; she sits by him,
   blandisheth him, and tendeth him, so that all the rest do as it were
   envy his disease and sickness. If nature doth thus, will not God, who
   is the author of nature, do much more? For if an earthly mother do thus
   to a sickly and suffering child, will not our heavenly Father, who hath
   an infinite, incredible, and tender Jove to his people? Surely he
   runneth to the afflicted, as the blood to the hurt member; he looketh
   after the afflicted, as the mother to the sick child. This is the
   difference between God and the world; the world runneth after those
   that flourish, and rejoice, and live in prosperity, as the rivers run
   to the sea, where there is water enough already; but God comforteth us
   in all our tribulations,' 2 Cor. i. 4. His name and style is, He
   comforteth those that are cast down,' 2 Cor. vii. 6. The world
   forsaketh those that are in poverty, disgrace, and want; but God doth
   not with draw from them, but visiteth them most, hath communion with
   them most, and vouchsafeth most of his presence to them, even to those
   that holily, meekly, and patiently bear the afflictions which he layeth
   upon them; and one drop of this honey is enough to sweeten the
   bitterest cup that ever they drank of. If God be with us, if the power
   of Christ will rest upon us,' then we may even glory in infirmities, as
   Paul did.

   (2.) Of our presence with God, when our afflictions are over; that is
   our happiness hereafter; we shall be there where he is: John xii. 26,
   There where I am shall my servant be;' and John xvii. 24, Father, I
   will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that
   they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me.' When we have had
   our trial and exercise, we shall live with him for ever; therefore is
   our comfort called everlasting consolation: 2 Thes. ii. 16, Who hath
   given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace.' Nothing
   more can be added or desired, if we have but the patience to tarry for
   it, that we may come to the sight of God and Christ at last. Surely
   this will lighten the heart of that sorrow and fear wherewith it is
   surcharged. Here is an everlasting ground of comfort; and if it doth
   not allay our fears and sorrows, the fault is not in the comfort, for
   that is a solid and eternal good; but on the believer's part, if he
   doth not keep his faith strong, and his evidences clear.

   4. It is a reviving comfort, which quickeneth the soul. Many times we
   seem to be dead to all spiritual operations, our affections are damped
   and discouraged; but the word of God puts life into the dead, and
   relieveth us in our greatest distresses. Sorrow worketh death, but joy
   is the life of the soul. Now when dead in all sense and feeling, the
   just shall live by faith,' Hab. ii. 4; and the hope wrought in us by
   the scriptures is a lively hope,' 1 Peter i. 3. Other things skin the
   wound, but our sore breaketh out again and runneth; faith penetrates
   into the inwards of a man, doth us good to the heart; and the soul
   reviveth by waiting upon God, and gets life and strength.

   Secondly, The provision which the word hath made for our comfort; it
   might be referred to four heads.

   1. Its commands.

   [1.] Provisionally, and by way of anticipation. The whole scripture is
   framed so that it still carrieth on its great end of making man subject
   to God and comfortable in himself. Our first lesson in the school of
   Christ is self-denial: Mat. xvi. 24, If any man will come after me, let
   him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.' Now this
   seemeth to be grievous, but provideth for comfort; for self-denial
   plucketh up all trouble by the root; the cross will not be very
   grievous to a self-denying spirit. Epictetus summed up all the wisdom
   that he could learn by the light of nature in these two words, ane'chou
   kai` ape'chou--bear and forbear; to which answereth the apostle's
   temperance, patience,' 2 Peter i. 6. Certainly were we more mortified
   and weaned from the world, and could we deny ourselves in things
   grateful to sense, we should not lie open to the stroke of troubles so
   often as we do. The greatness of our affections causeth the greatness
   of our afflictions. Did we possess earthly things with less love, we
   should lose them with less grief. Had we more entirely resigned our
   selves to God, and did love carnal self less, we should less be
   troubled when we are lessened in the world. Thus provisionally, and by
   way of anticipation, doth the word of God provide against our sorrows.
   The wheels of a watch do protrude and thrust forward one another; so
   one part of Christian doctrine doth help another: take any piece
   asunder, and then it is hard to be practised. Patience is hard if there
   be no thorough resignation to God, no temperance and command of our
   affections; but Christianity is all of a piece; one part well received
   and digested befriendeth another.

   [2.] Directly, and by way of express charge, the scripture requireth us
   to moderate our sorrow, to cast all our care upon God, to look above
   temporal things, and hath expressly forbidden distracting cares, and
   doubts, and inordinate sorrows: 1 Peter v. 7, Cast all your care upon
   God, for he careth for you;' and Phil. iv. 6, Be careful for nothing.'
   We have a religion that maketh it unlawful to be sad and miserable, and
   to grieve ourselves inordinately: care, fear, and anguish of mind are
   forbidden, and no sorrow allowed us but what tendeth to our joy: Isa.
   xxxv. 4, Say to them that are of fearful hearts, Be strong, fear not;'
   Isa, xli. 10, Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, I am thy God.'
   To fear the rage, and power, and violence of enemies, is contrary to
   the religion which we do profess: Fear not them which can kill the
   body,' Mat. x. 26, 28. Now surely the word, which is full fraught with
   precepts of this nature, must needs comfort and stay the heart.

   2. The doctrines of the word do quicken and comfort us in our greatest
   distresses, all of them concerning justification and salvation by
   Christ; they serve to deaden the heart to present things, and lift it
   up to better, and so to beget a kind of dedolency and insensibility of
   this world's crosses; but especially four doctrines we have in the word
   of God that are very comforting.

   [1.] The doctrine concerning particular providence, that nothing
   falleth out without God's appointment, and that he looketh after every
   individual person as if none else to care for. This is a mighty ground
   of comfort; for nothing can befall me but what my Father wills, and he
   is mindful of me in the condition wherein I am, knoweth what things I
   stand in need of, and nothing is exempted from his care, ordering, and
   disposal. This is a ground both of patience and comfort: Ps. xxxix. 9,
   I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.' So
   Hezekiah: Isa. xxxviii. 15, What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto
   me, and himself hath done it.' It is time to cease, or say no more; why
   should we contend with the Lord? Is it a sickness or grievous bodily
   pain? What difference is there between a man that owneth it as a chance
   or natural accident, and one that seeth God's hand in it? We storm if
   we look no further than second causes; but one that looketh on it as an
   immediate stroke of God's providence hath nothing to reply by way of
   murmuring and expostulation. So in loss of good children; how do we
   rave against instruments, if we look no further! But if we consider the
   providence of God, Job i. 23, not Dominus dedit, diabolus abstulit, but
   The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name
   of the Lord,' So for contumely and reproaches; if God let loose a
   harking Shimei upon us, 2 Sam. xvi. 11, The Lord bid him curse.' To
   resist a lower officer is to resist the authority with which he is
   armed. So in all other cases, it is a ground of patience and comfort to
   see God in the providence.

   [2.] His fatherly care over his people. He hath taken them into his
   family, and all his doings with them are paternal and fatherly. It
   allayeth our cares: Mat. vi. 32, Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye
   hath need of all these things.' Our sorrows in affliction are lessened
   by considering they come from our Father: Heb. xii. 5-7, Ye have
   forgotten the exhortation that speaketh upon you as unto children, My
   son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou
   art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God
   dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is that whom the father
   chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are
   partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons;' and so those whom God
   doth love tenderly, he doth correct severely.

   [3.] His unchangeable love to his people. God remaineth unchangeably
   the same. When our outward condition doth vary and alter, we have the
   same blessed God as a rock to stand upon, and to derive our comforts
   from, that we had before: he is the God of the valleys, as well as of
   the hills. Christ in his desertion saith, My God, my God,' Mat. xxvii.
   46. Surely we deserve that the creature should be taken from us, if we
   cannot find comfort in God: Hab. iii. 18, Although the fig-tree should
   not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vine, &c., yet will I
   rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in the God of my salvation;' Nothing
   can separate us from the love of God,' Rom. viii. 36. Men may separate
   us from our houses, countries, friends, estates, but not from God, who
   is our great delight. In our low estate we have a God to go to for
   comfort, and who should be more to us than our sweetest pleasures.

   [4.] The scripture showeth us the true doctrine about afflictions, and
   discovereth to us the author, cause, and end of all our afflictions.
   The author is God, the cause is sin, the end is to humble, mortify, and
   correct his children, that they may be more capable of heavenly glory.
   God is the author; not fortune, or chance, or the will of man; but God,
   who doth all things with the most exact wisdom, and tender mercy, and
   purest love. The cause is just: Micah vii. 9, I will bear the
   indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.' The end is
   our profit, for his chastisements are purgative medicines, to prevent
   or cure some spiritual disease. If God should never administer physic
   till we see it needful, desire to take it, or be willing of it, we
   should perish in our corruptions, or die in our sins, for want of help
   in due time: 1 Cor. xi. 32, But when we are judged, we are chastened of
   the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.' Now, should
   we not patiently and comfortably endure those things which come by the
   will of our Father, through our sins, and for our good?

   3. The examples of the word, which show us that the dearly beloved of
   the Lord have suffered harder things than we have done, and with
   greater patience. Christ: 1 Peter ii. 21, Who suffered for us, leaving
   us an example that we should follow his steps.' The servants of the
   Lord: James v. 10, Take, my brethren, the prophets of the Lord, who
   have spoken the word of the Lord, for an example of suffering
   affliction, and of patience.' We complain of stone and gout; what did
   our Lord Jesus Christ endure when the whole weight of his body hung
   upon four wounds, and his life dropped out by degrees? We complain of
   every painful disease, but how was it with Christ when his back was
   scourged, and his flesh mangled with whips? We are troubled at the
   swellings of the gout in hands or feet; how was it with him when those
   sinewy parts were pierced with strong and great nails? We complain of
   the want of spiritual consolations; was not he deserted? We mourn when
   God maketh a breach upon our relations; was not Abraham's trial
   greater, when he was to offer his son with his own hands? Heb. xi. 17,
   By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had
   received the promise offered up his only-begotten son.' Job lost all
   his children at once by a blast of wind. The Virgin Mary near the cross
   of Christ, Woman, behold thy son,' John xix. 26. She was affected and
   afflicted with that sight, as if a sword pierced through her heart.' We
   complain of poverty; Christ had not where to lay his head.' If we lose
   our coat to keep our conscience, others of God's children have been
   thus tried before us: Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your
   goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an
   enduring substance.' The Levites left their inheritance,' 2 Chron. xi.
   14. Thus God doth not call us by any rougher way to heaven than others
   have gone before us.

   4. The promises of scripture. To instance in all would be endless.
   There are three great promises which comfort us in all our
   afflictions--the promises of pardon of sins, and eternal life, and the
   general promises about our temporal estate.

   [1.] The promises of pardon of sin. We can have no true cure for our
   sorrow till we be exempted from the fear of the wrath of God. Do that
   once, and the heart of sorrow and misery is broken. Others may steal a
   little peace when conscience is laid asleep, but not solid comfort till
   sin be pardoned: Isa. xl. 1, 2, Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
   your God; speak ye comfortably unto Jerusalem, and cry unto her that
   her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned;' Mat. ix.
   2, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee;' Rom. v. 1,
   Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
   Lord Jesus Christ.'

   [2.] The promises of eternal life. Nothing will afford us so much
   content as one scripture promise of eternal life would do to a faithful
   soul. Heaven in the promise seen by faith is enough to revive the most
   doleful and afflicted creature: Mat. v. 12, Rejoice and be exceeding
   glad, for great is your reward in heaven.' Nothing can be grievous to
   him that knoweth a world to come, and hath the assurance of the eternal
   God that shortly he shall enjoy the happiness of it: Rom. v. 2, We
   rejoice in hope of the glory of God.' This comforts against troubles,
   sicknesses, wants. Everlasting ease, everlasting joy, surely will
   counterbalance all that we can endure and suffer for or from God. There
   all our fears and sorrows shall be at an end, and all tears shall be
   wiped from our eyes.

   [3.] The general promises concerning our temporal estate. There are
   many particular promises concerning the supply of all our necessities,
   removing of our grievances and burdens, or else that God will allay our
   troubles and enable us to bear them, mix with them the taste of his
   goodness and fatherly love. But I shall only speak of those general
   promises, that we may be confident that he will never utterly fail his
   people: Heb. xiii. 5, He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake
   thee;' that he will not give us over to insupportable difficulties: 1
   Cor. x. 13, There hath no temptation taken you but what is common to
   man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
   what you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to
   escape, that you may be able to bear it.' He will dispose of all things
   for the best to them that love him, Rom. viii. 28. These things are
   absolutely undertaken, and these things should satisfy us.

   Thirdly, From the manner wherein this comfort is received. They are
   applied by the Spirit, who is a comforter, and received by faith.

   1. Applied by the Spirit, which is dispensed in a concomitancy with
   this word: Rom. xv. 13, Now the God of hope till you with all joy and
   peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of
   the Holy Ghost.' The Holy Ghost is purposely given to be our comforter.
   If we are fit to receive it, he will not be wanting to give solid joy
   and delight to the penitent and believing soul.

   2. It is received by faith. The word of God cannot deceive us. Faith is
   contented with a promise, though it hath not possession; for, Heb. xi.
   1, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of
   things not seen.' Sickness with a promise, poverty with a promise,
   captivity with a promise, is better than health, riches, liberty
   without one; yea, death with a promise is better than life. What you
   possess without a promise you may lose when most secure: Luke xii. 19,
   20, I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many
   years; eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this
   night shall thy soul be required of thee; then whose shall those things
   be that thou hast provided?' But in the eye of faith, that which we
   hope for is more than that which we possess; for we have God's word; it
   is set before us.

   Use 1. For information.

   1. How likely it is that the children of God will be exercised with
   afflictions, because God in his word hath laid in so many comforts
   before hand; a full third of the scriptures would be lost, and be as
   bladders given to a man that stands on dry land, and never meaneth to
   go into deep waters: Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward,'
   Job v. 7. Many think they come into the world not to bear crosses, but
   to spend their days in pleasure; but alas! how soon do they find
   themselves mistaken, and confuted by experience! If life be anything
   lengthened out, it is vexed with the remembrance of what is past, or
   trouble of what is present, or fear of what is to come. The first part
   of our life we know not ourselves; in the middle, we are filled with
   cares and sorrows; our last burdened with weakness and age. But now the
   godly are more appointed to troubles, because God will try their faith,
   perfect their patience, train them up for a better world. They are now
   hated by the world: 2 Tim. iii. 12, Yea, and all that will live godly
   in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;' Acts xiv. 22, We must
   through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.' He that would
   not be exempted from the hopes of Christians, he must not look to be
   exempted from the troubles of Christians.

   2. The excellency of the word of God and the religion it establisheth.
   It containeth store of sure comforts; and when all other comforts can
   do us no good, then the word of God affordeth us relief and support.
   Bare human reason cannot find out such grounds of comfort in all their
   philosophy; it doth not penetrate to the inwards of a man. It will tell
   us it is in vain to trouble ourselves about what we cannot help: Jer.
   x. 19, It is an evil, and I must bear it;' that we are not without
   fellows, others suffer as much as we do, &c.; but the word of God
   giveth us other consolations--the pardon of sin, the promises of a
   better life; that if we lose temporal things we shall have eternal;
   that we would not fear the threatenings of men, having the promises of
   God, &c., nor death, which hath life at the back of it; these are
   comforts indeed. When David was even dead in the nest, the word, that
   was not so clear then in these points as now, revived him. What would
   he have said if he had known the gospel so fully as we do? How should
   we be affected that live in so much light?

   Use 2. For reproof to those that seek other comforts,

   1. In the vanities of the world. This is too slight a plaster to cure
   man's sore or heal his wound: the comforts of this world appear and
   vanish in a moment; every blast of a temptation scattereth them. It
   must be the hope and enjoyment of some solid satisfaction that can
   fortify the heart and breed any solid and lasting comfort, and this the
   world cannot give unto us; but in the word we have it. Alas! what is a
   dream of honour, or the good- will and word of a mortal man?
   Everlasting glory is as much above all these as the treasures of a
   kingdom before a child's toys. May-games, vain pleasures, are gone
   before we well feel that we have them.

   2. Or in philosophy. That cannot give a true ground of comfort. That
   was it the wise men of the world aimed at to fortify the soul against
   troubles; but as they never understood the true ground of misery, which
   is sin, so they never understood the true ground or way of comfort,
   which is Christ. That which man offereth cannot come with such
   authority and power as that which God offereth. The light of reason
   cannot have such an efficacy as divine testimony. This is a poor
   moonlight, that rotteth before it ripeneth anything. In short, they
   were never acquainted with Christ, who is the foundation of comfort;
   nor the promise of heaven, which is the true matter of comfort; nor
   faith, which is the instrument to receive comfort; so that you leave
   the fountain of living water for the dead puddle of a filthy ditch, if
   you think the writings of the heathens will comfort you and revive you,
   and neglect the word of God that brings rest for the soul.

   3. Those are to be reproved that are under a spiritual institution, and
   profess to keep to it, and do so little honour it, either by their
   patience or comfort, or hope under troubles. Wherefore were the great
   mysteries of godliness made known to us, and the promises of the world
   to come, and all the directions concerning the subjection of the soul
   to God, and those blessed privileges we enjoy by Christ, if they all be
   not able to satisfy and stay your heart, and compose it to a quiet
   submission to God when it is his pleasure to take away your comforts
   from you? What! Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician
   there?' Will not all the word of God yield you a cordial or a cure? Oh!
   consider what a disparagement you put upon the provision Christ hath
   made for us, as if the scripture were a weaker thing than the
   institutions of philosophy, or the vain delights of the world! But what
   may be the reasons of such an obstinacy of grief?

   [l.] Sometimes ignorance. They do not study the grounds of comfort, or
   do not remember them; for oblivion is an ignorance for the time: Heb.
   xii. 5, Have ye forgotten the exhortation that speaketh to you as
   children?' They are like Hagar, have a well of comfort nigh, and yet
   ready to die for thirst. The scripture hath breasts of comfort, so full
   as a breast ready to discharge itself, and yet they ate not comforted.

   [2.] They indulge and give way to the present malady, hug the
   distemper, and do not consider the evil of it; as Rachel refused to be
   comforted,' Jer. xxxi. 15.

   [3.] They do not chide themselves, ask the soul the reason, cite it
   before the tribunal of conscience, which is one way to allay passions:
   Ps. xlii. 5, Why art thou so disquieted, O my soul?' They look to the
   grievance, not to the comfort, as that which is of use; they aggravate
   the grievance and lessen the love of God: Are the consolations of God
   so small with thee?' Job xv. 11. It is spoken to them who have high
   thoughts of their troubles, low thoughts of God's comforts.

   [4.] Uncertainty in religion. Principles must be fixed before they can
   be improved, and we can feel their influence and power. But people will
   be making essays, and try this and try that. God's grounds of comfort
   are immutably fixed; God will not change his gospel laws for thy sake:
   and therefore, unless we would have a mountebank's cure, we must stand
   to them: Jer. vi. 16, Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and
   see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk
   therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.' When we have tried
   all, we must come home at length to these things; and our uncertainty
   in religion will be none of the meanest causes of our troubles.

   [5.] They look to means and their natural operation, and neglect God;
   and God only will be known to be the God of all comfort: 2 Cor. i. 3,
   4, Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
   of mercies, and the God of all comforts, who comforteth us in all our
   tribulation.'

   Use 3. To exhort us--

   1. To prize and esteem the scriptures, and consult with them often:
   there you have the knowledge of God, who is best worth our knowing; and
   the way how we may come to enjoy him, wherein our happiness lieth. It
   is a petty wisdom to be able to gather riches, manage your business in
   the world. Ordinary learning is a good ornament, but this is the
   excellent, deep, and profound learning, to know how to be saved. What
   is it I press you to know?--the course of the heavens, to number the
   orbs and the stars in them, to measure their circumference and reckon
   their motions, and not to know him that sits in the circle of them, nor
   know how to inhabit and dwell there? Oh, how should this commend the
   word of God to us, where eternal life is discovered, and the way how to
   get it! Other writings and discourses may tickle the fancy with
   pleasing eloquence, but that delight is vanishing, like a musician's
   voice. Other writings may represent some petty and momentary advantage;
   but time will put an end to that, so that within a little while the
   advantage of all the books in the world will be gone; but the
   scriptures, that tell us of eternal life and death, their effects will
   abide for ever: Ps. cxix. 96, I have seen an end of all perfections,
   but thy commandments are exceeding broad.' When heaven and earth pass
   away, this will not pass; that is, the effects will abide in heaven and
   hell. Know ye not that your souls were created for eternity, and that
   they will eternally survive all these present things? and shall your
   thoughts, projects, and designs be confined within the narrow bounds of
   time? Oh, no! Let your affections be to that book that will teach you
   to live well for ever, in comparison of which all earthly felicity is
   lighter than vanity.

   2. Be diligent in the hearing, reading, meditating on those things that
   are contained there. The earth is the fruitful mother of all herbs and
   plants, but yet it must be tilled, ploughed, harrowed, and dressed, or
   else it bringeth forth little fruit. The scripture containeth all the
   grounds of hope, comfort, and happiness, the only remedy of sin and
   misery, our rule to walk by till our blessedness be perfected; but we
   have little benefit by it unless it be improved by diligent meditation:
   Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in that law doth
   he meditate day and night.' This must be your chief delight, and you
   must be versed therein upon all occasions: Ps. cxix. 97, Oh, how love I
   thy law! it is my meditation all the day.' When we love it and prize
   it, it will be so, for our thoughts cannot be kept off from what we
   love and delight in.

   3. Reader, hear, meditate with a spirit of application, and an aim of
   profit: Job v. 27, Hear it, and know thou it for thy good:' as the rule
   of your actions and the charter of your hopes:' Rom. viii. 31, What
   shall we then say to these things?' That you may grow better and wiser,
   and may have more advantages in your heavenly progress, take home your
   portion of the bread of life, and turn it into the seed of your life.
   It is not enough to seek truth in the scriptures, but you must seek
   life in the scriptures. It is not an object only to satisfy your
   understandings with the contemplation of truth, but your hearts with
   the enjoyment of life; and therefore you must not only bring your
   judgment to find the light of truth, but your affections to embrace the
   goodness of life offered. Think not ye have found all, when you have
   found truth and learned it. No; except you find life there, you have
   missed the best treasure. You must bring your understandings and
   affections to them, and not depart till both return full.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LVII.

   The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not declined from
   thy law.--Ver. 51.

   IN these words are--

   1. David's temptation.

   2. His constancy and perseverance in his duty notwithstanding that
   temptation.

   First, In the temptation observe--

   1. The persons from whom the temptation did arise, the proud. The
   wicked are called so for two reasons:--

   [1.] Because either they despise God and contemn his ways, which is the
   greatest pride that can fall upon the heart of a reasonable creature:
   Rom. i. 30, Haters of God, despiteful, proud.'

   [2.] Or else, because they are drunk with worldly felicity. In the
   general, scoffing cometh from pride. What is, Prov. iii. 34, He
   scorneth the scorners, and giveth grace to the lowly,' is, James iv. 6,
   He resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.'

   2. Observe the kind or nature of the temptation; he was had in
   derision. This may be supposed either for dependence on God's promises,
   or for obedience to his precepts. Atheistical men, that wholly look to
   the pleasing of the flesh and the interest of the present world, make a
   mock of both. We have instances of both in scripture.

   [1.] They make a mock of reliance upon God when we are in distress;
   think it ridiculous to talk of relief from heaven when earthly power
   faileth: Ps. xxii. 7, 8, They laugh me to scorn, saying, He trusted in
   the Lord.' The great promise of Christ's coming is flouted at by those
   mockers: 2 Peter iii. 3, 4, There shall come in the last days mockers,
   walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his
   coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they
   were from the creation.' Such scoffers are in all ages, but now they
   overflow. These latter times are the dregs of Christianity, in which
   such kind of men are more rife than the serious worshippers of Christ.
   At the first promulgation of the gospel, while truths were new, and the
   exercises of Christian religion lively and serious, and great concord
   among the professors of the gospel, they were rare and infrequent.
   Before men's senses were benumbed with the frequent experiences of
   God's power, and the customary use of religious duties, and the notions
   of God were fresh and active upon their hearts, they were not heard of;
   but when the profession of Christianity grew into a form and national
   interest, and men fell into it by the chance of their birth rather than
   their own choice and rational conviction, the church was pestered with
   this kind of cattle. But especially are they rife among us when men are
   grown weary of the name of Christ, and the ancient severity and
   strictness of religion is much lost, and the memory of those miracles
   and wonderful effects by which our religion was once confirmed almost
   worn out; or else questioned and impugned by subtle wits and men of a
   prostituted conscience. Therefore now are many mockers and atheistical
   spirits everywhere, who ask, Where is the promise of his coming?'
   question all, and think that there are none but a few credulous fools
   that depend upon the hopes of the gospel.

   [2.] Their obedience to his precepts. And so whosoever will be true to
   his religion, and live according to his baptismal vow, is set up for a
   sign of contradiction to be spoken against. It is supposed the mocking
   by the heathen of the Jews is intended in these words, Lam. iv. 15,
   Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled
   away and wandered.' The words are somewhat obscure, but some judicious
   interpreters understand them of the detestation of the Jewish religion,
   their circumcision, their sabbaths, &c. But however that be, certainly
   the children of God are often mocked for their strict obedience, as
   well as their faith.

   3. Observe the degree, greatly. The word noteth continually. The
   Septuagint translates it by spho'dra; the vulgar Latin by usque valde
   and usque longe. They derided him with all possible bitterness, and day
   by day they had their scoffs for him; so that it was both a grievous
   and a perpetual temptation.

   Secondly, His constancy and perseverance in the duty; that is set
   forth--

   1. By the rule in the word, thy law. If we have God's law to justify
   our practice, it is no matter who condemneth it; we have God's warrant
   to set against man's censure. It must be God's way wherein we seek to
   be approved; otherwise our reproach is justly deserved, if it be for
   obstinacy in our own fancies.

   2. The firmness and strictness of his adherence: I have not declined.
   The word signifies either to turn aside or to turn back. Sometimes it
   is put for turning aside to the right hand or to the left; as Deut.
   xvii. 11, Thou shalt not decline from the way which they shall show to
   thee, to the right hand or to the left;' sometimes for turning back:
   Job xxiii. 11, My feet have held his steps; his way have I kept, and
   not declined; neither have I gone back from the commandment of his
   lips.' As it is taken for turning aside, it noteth error and wandering;
   as it is taken for turning back, it noteth apostasy and defection. Now
   David meaneth that he had neither declined in whole nor in part.
   Understand it of his faith: all their scoffs and bitter sarcasms did
   not discourage him, or tempt him to forsake his hold, or let go the
   comfort of the promise. Understand it of his obedience: he still
   closely cleaved to God's way. A declining implieth an inclining first.
   Well, then, David did not only keep from open apostasy, but from
   declining or turning aside in the least to any hand. Testimonies we
   have of his integrity in scripture: 1 Kings xiv. 8, David kept my
   commandment, and followed me with all his heart, to do only that which
   was right in my sight.' His great blemish is mentioned elsewhere: 1
   Kings xv. 5, David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,
   and turned not aside from anything which he commanded him all the days
   of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.' However,
   the derision of his enemies. made him not to warp.

   Doct. That a Christian should not suffer himself to be flouted out of
   his religion, either in whole or in part; or no scorn and contempt cast
   upon us should draw us from our obedience to God.

   In the managing of it observe--

   1. That a holy life is apt to be made a scorn by carnal men.

   2. That this, as it is a usual, so it is a grievous temptation.

   3. That yet this should not move us either to open defection or partial
   declining.

   First, That a holy life is apt to be made a scorn by carnal men, and
   they that abstain from iniquity are as owls among their neighbours, the
   wonder and the reproach of all that are about them. To evidence this, I
   shall give you an account of some of the scorns which are cast upon
   religion, with the reasons of them.

   1. Some of the scorns are these:--

   [1.] Seriousness in religion is counted mopishness and melancholy. When
   men will not flaunt it and rant it, and please the flesh as others do,
   but take time for meditation, and prayer, and praise, then they are
   mopish.

   [2.] Self-denial, when, upon hopes of the world to come, they grow dead
   to present interests, and can hazard them for God, and can for sake all
   for a naked Christ; the world thinketh this humorous folly. To do all
   things by the prescript of the word, and live upon the hopes of an
   unseen world, is by them that would accommodate themselves to present
   interests counted madness.

   [3.] Zeal in a good cause is in itself a good thing (Gal. iv. 18, It is
   good to be zealously affected always in a good thing'), but the world
   is wont to call good evil. As astronomers call the glorious stars by
   horrid names, the serpent, the dragon's tail, the greater or lesser
   bear, the dog-star; so the world is grossly guilty of misnaming. God
   will not be served in a cold and careless fashion. See Rom. xii. 11,
   zeontes pneumati, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.' But this will
   not suit with that lazy and dull pace which is called temper and
   moderation in the world.

   [4.] Holy singularity; as Noah was an upright man in a corrupt age:
   Gen. vi. 9, Noah walked with God.' And we are bidden not to conform
   ourselves to this world,' Rom. xii. 2. Now, because they would have
   none to upbraid them in their sins, and to part ways, and the number of
   the godly is fewer, they count it a factious singularity in them that
   walk contrary to the course of the world and the stream of common
   examples.

   [5.] Fervour of devotion and earnest conversing with God in humble
   prayers is called imposture and enthusiasm. The world, who are wholly
   sunk in flesh and matter, are little acquainted with these elevations
   and enlargements of the spirit, think all to be imposture and
   enthusiasm. And though praying by the Spirit be a great
   privilege,--(Jude 20, Praying in the Holy Ghost;' Rom. viii. 26,
   Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what
   we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself helpeth our
   infirmities with groanings which cannot be uttered;' Zech. xii. 10, I
   will pour upon you the spirit of grace and of supplication')--yet it is
   little relished by them; a flat dead way of praying suiteth their gust
   better. Christ compareth the duties of the gospel, fasting, with prayer
   in the Spirit, to new wine, which will break old bottles, Mat. ix. 17;
   but the duties of the Pharisees to old, dead, and insipid wine; there
   is no life in them.

   [6.] Serious speaking of God and heavenly things is, in the phrase of
   the world, canting. Indeed, to speak swelling words of vanity, or an
   unintelligible jargon, betrayeth religion to scorn; but a pure lip and
   speech seasoned with salt, and that holy things should be spoken of in
   a holy manner, our Lord requireth.

   [7.] Faith of the future eternal state is esteemed a fond credulity by
   them who affect the vanities of the world, and the honours and
   pleasures thereof. They are all for sight and present things, and
   Christianity inviteth us to things spiritual and heavenly. Now, to live
   upon the hopes of an unseen world, and that to come, they judge it to
   be but foppery and needless superstition. Thus do poor creatures, drunk
   with the delusions of the flesh, judge of the holy things of God.

   [8.] The humility of Christians, and their pardoning wrongs and
   forgiving injuries, they count to be simplicity or stupidness, though
   the law of Christ requireth us to forgive others, as God for Christ's
   sake hath forgiven us.

   [9.] Exact walking is scrupulosity and preciseness, and men are more
   nice than wise; which is a reproach that reflecteth a mighty contempt
   upon God himself, that when he hath made a holy law for the government
   of the world, that the obeying of this law should be derided by
   professed Christians; the scorn must needs fall on him that made the
   law, and gave us these commands. If he be too precise that imperfectly
   obeyeth God, what will you say of God himself, who commandeth more than
   any of us all performeth? Thus the children of God are not only
   reproached as hypocrites, but derided as fools; and it is counted as a
   part of wit and breeding to droll at the serious practice of godliness,
   as if religion were but a foppery.

   2. The reasons of this are these:--

   [1.] Their natural blindness: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The natural man receiveth
   not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him;
   neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' They
   are incompetent judges: Prov. xxiv. 7, Wisdom is too high for a fool.'
   Though by nature we have lost our light, yet we have not lost our
   pride: Prov. xxvi. 16, The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than
   seven men that can render a reason.' Though their way in religion be
   but a sluggish, lazy, and dead course, yet they have a high conceit of
   it, and censure all that is contrary, or but a degree removed above it.
   From spiritual blindness it is that carnal men judge unrighteously and
   perversely of God's servants, and count zeal and forwardness in
   religious duties to be but folly and madness.

   [2.] Antipathy and prejudicate malice. The graceless scoff at the
   gracious, and the profane at the serious; there is a different course,
   and that produceth difference of affections: John xv. 19, The world
   will love its own, but because I have chosen you out of the world,
   therefore the world hateth you:' and they manifest their malice and
   hatred this way by evil-speaking: 1 Peter iv. 4, Speaking evil of you.'

   [3.] Want of a closer view. Christians complained in the primitive
   times that they were condemned unheard, dia` te`n phe'men, and dia` to`
   o'noma, without any particular inquiry into their principles and
   practices. And Tertullian saith, nolentes auditis, &c.--they would not
   inquire, because they had a mind to hate. A man riding afar off seeing
   people dancing, would think they were mad, till he draws near and
   observes the harmonious order. They will not take a nearer view of the
   regularity of the ways of God, and therefore scoff at them.

   [4.] Because you do by your practice condemn that life that they
   affect: John vii. 7, The world hateth me, because I testify that their
   deeds are evil:' Heb. xi. 7, Noah by faith, being warned of God of
   things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving
   of his house, by the which he condemned the world.' Now they would not
   have their guilt revived; and therefore, since they will not come up to
   others by a religious imitation, they seek to bring others down to
   themselves by scoffs, reproaches, and censures.

   [5.] They are set awork by Satan, thereby to keep off young beginners,
   and to discourage and molest the godly themselves; for bitter words
   pierce deep and enter into the very soul.

   Secondly, It is a grievous temptation; it is reckoned in scripture
   among the persecutions: Gal. iv. 29, As he that was born after the
   flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so is it
   now.' He meaneth those bitter mockings that Isaac did suffer from
   Ishmael: Gen. xxi. 9, And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian,
   which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.' When the wicked mock at our
   interest in God, shame our confidence, the church complaineth of it:
   Ps. cxxiii. 4, We are filled with the scorning of those that are at
   ease, and with the contempt of the proud:' the insinuations of those
   that live in full pomp, over the confidence and hope the saints have in
   God. So we read, Heb. x. 33, that the servants of God were made a
   gazing-stock by reproaches and afflictions:' again, of cruel mockings,'
   Heb. xi. 36. It is more grievous when they mock and persecute at the
   same time; there is both pain and shame. The parties mocked were God's
   saints; the parties mocking were their persecutors and enemies, which
   sometimes proved to be their own brethren, of the same nation,
   language, kindred, religion. In short, these mockings issue out of
   contempt, and tend to the disgrace and dishonour of the party mocked;
   they make it their sport to abuse them. David saith, Reproach hath
   broken my heart,' Ps. lxix. 20.

   Thirdly, This should not move us either to open defection or partial
   declining, for these reasons:--

   1. It is one of the usual evils wherewith the people of God are
   tempted. Now a Christian should be fortified against obvious and usual
   evils. Let no man that is truly religious think that he can escape the
   mockage and contempt of the wicked. Jesus Christ him self endured the
   contradiction of sinners,' Heb. xii. 3; and the rather, that we might
   not wax weary and faint in our minds. This is a part of his cross,
   which we must bear after him. The Pharisees derided his ministry: Luke
   xvi. 14, The Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things,
   and derided him.' They flouted at him when he hung on the cross: Mat.
   xxvii. 39-44, They that passed by him reviled him, wagging their heads,
   and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
   days, save thyself: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the
   cross. Likewise also the chief priests, mocking him with the scribes
   and elders, said, He saved others, himself he cannot save: if he be the
   king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
   believe him: he trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will
   have him; for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also which were
   crucified with him cast the same in his teeth.' So Acts xvii. 32, Some
   mocked, and said, What will this babbler say?' Well, then, since it is
   a usual evil which God's children have suffered, it should be the less
   to us. Little can the wicked say if they cannot scoff, and little can
   we endure if we cannot abide a bad word. There needs no great deal ado
   to advance a man into the chair of the scorner; if they have wickedness
   and boldness enough, they may soon let fly.

   2. This, as well as other afflictions, are not excepted out of our
   resignation to God. We must be content to be mocked and scorned, as
   well as to be persecuted and molested. It is mentioned in the
   beatitudes, Mat. v. 11, Blessed are you when men shall revile you, and
   persecute you, and say all manner of evil falsely against you for my
   sake.'

   3. Railing and calumniating will never prevail with rational and
   conscientious men to cause them to change their opinions. To leave the
   truth because others rail at it, is to consult with our affections, not
   out judgments. Solid reasoning convinceth our judgments, but raillery
   is to our affections; and a rational conscientious man is governed by
   an enlightened mind, not perverse and preposterous affections: Eph. v.
   17, Be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.'
   Therefore an honest man will not quit truth because others rail; no, he
   looketh to his rule and warrant. A man will not be railed out of
   errors; nay, often they are the more rooted because ill-confuted.

   4. It is the duty of God's children to justify wisdom: Mat. xi. 19,
   Wisdom is justified of her children.' What is it to justify wisdom?
   Justification is a relative word, opposed to crimination, so to justify
   is the work of an advocate; or to condemnation, so it is the work of a
   judge. The children of wisdom discharge both parts; they plead for the
   ways of God, and exalt them: so much as others deny them, they value
   them, esteem them, hold them for good and right. When they are never so
   much condemned and despised, the more zealous the saints will be for
   them: I will yet be more vile.'

   5. Carnal men at the same time approve what they seem to condemn; they
   hate and fear strictness: Mark vi. 20, Herod feared John, because he
   was a just man and an holy, and observed him.' They scoff at it with
   their tongues, but have a fear of it in their consciences; they revile
   it white they live, but what mind are they of when they come to die?
   Then all speak well of a holy life, and the strictest obedience to the
   laws of God: Num. xxiii. 10, Let me die the death of the righteous, and
   let my last end be like his;' Mat. xxv. 8, Give us of your oil, for our
   lamps are gone out.' Oh, that they had a little of that holiness and
   strictness which they scoffed at whilst they were pursuing their lusts!
   How will men desire to die? as carnal and careless sinners, or as
   mortified saints? Once more, they approve it in thesi, and condemn it
   in hypothesi. All the scoffers at godliness with in the pale of the
   visible church have the same Bible, baptism, creed, pretend to believe
   in the same God and Christ, which they own with those whom they oppose.
   All the difference is, the one are real Christians, the other are
   nominal; some profess at large, the others practise what they profess;
   the one have a religion to talk of, the others to live by. Once more,
   they approve it in the form, but hate it in the power. A picture of
   Christ that is drawn by a painter they like, and the for bidden image
   of God made by a carver, they will reverence and honour and be zealous
   for; but the image of God framed by the Spirit in the hearts of the
   faithful, and described in the lives of the heavenly and the
   sanctified, this they scorn and scoff at.

   6. Their judgment is perverse, not to be stood upon. They count the
   children of God foolish and crack-brained. The crimination may be
   justly retorted; their way is folly and madness, for they go dancing to
   their destruction. Though there be a God by whom and for whom they were
   made, and from whom they are fallen, and that they cannot be happy but
   in returning to him again, yet they carry it so as if there were no
   misery but in bodily and worldly things, no happiness but in pleasing
   the senses. The beginning, progress, and end of their course is from
   themselves, in themselves, and to themselves. They pour out their
   hearts to inconsiderable toys and trifles, and will neither admit
   information of their error, nor reformation of their practice till
   death destroy them. They neglect their main business, and leave it
   undone, and run up and down, they know not why, like children that
   follow a bubble blown out of a shell of soap, till it break and
   dissolve. Now should those that are flying from wrath to come, and
   seeking after God and their happiness, be discouraged because these mad
   and merry worldlings scoff at them for their diligent seriousness?
   Surely we should deride their derisions and contemn their contempt, who
   despise God and Christ and their salvation. Should a wise man be
   troubled because madmen rail at him? If they glory in their shame,'
   Phil. iii. 19, we must not be ashamed of our glory, nor ashamed to be
   found praying rather than sinning. If they think you fools for
   preferring heaven before inconsiderable vanities, remember they can no
   more judge of these things than a blind man of colours.

   7. If some dishonour, others will honour us, who are better able to
   judge: Ps. xv. 4, In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he
   honoureth them that fear the Lord.' Some have as low an opinion of the
   world as the carnal world hath of the certainty of God's word. They who
   labour to bring piety and godliness into a creditable esteem and
   reputation will pay a hearty honour and respect to every good and godly
   man: 2 Cor. vi. 8, 9, By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good
   report, as deceivers, yet true; as unknown, yet well known; as dying,
   but behold we live; as chastened and not killed;' contumeliously used
   by some, and reverently by others; vilified and contemned, counted
   deceivers by some, yet owned by others as faithful dispensers of the
   truth of God; not esteemed and looked on by some, by others owned and
   valued: thus God dispenseth the lot of his servants.

   8. A Christian should be satisfied in the approbation of God, and the
   honour he puts upon him: John v. 44, How can ye believe, that receive
   honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God
   only?' If God hath taken him into his family, and hath put his image
   upon him, and admitted him into present communion with him, and giveth
   him the testimony of his Spirit to assure him of his adoption here, and
   will hereafter receive him into eternal glory, this is enough, and more
   than enough, to counterbalance all the scorn of the world and the
   disgrace they would put upon us. If God approve us, should we be
   dejected at the scorn of a fool? Is the approbation of the eternal God
   so small in our eyes, that everything can weigh it down, and cast the
   balance with us? Alas! their scorning and dishonouring is nothing to
   the honour which God puts upon us.

   9. There is a time when the promised crown shall be set upon our heads,
   and who will be ashamed then--the scoffer or the serious worshipper of
   Christ? God is resolved to honour Christ's faithful servants: John xii.
   26, He that honoureth me, him shall my Father honour.' He will honour
   us at death, that is our private entrance into heaven; but he will much
   more honour us publicly, at the day of judgment, when we shall be
   owned: Rev. iii. 5, I will confess his name before my Father, and
   before his angels:' and Christ shall be admired for the glory he puts
   upon a poor worm: 2 Thes. i. 10, When he shall come to be glorified in
   his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.' The wicked
   shall be reckoned with, called to an account by Christ: Jude, 14, 15,
   The Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment
   upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their
   ungodly deeds which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their
   hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him:' yea,
   judged by the saints: 1 Cor. vi. 2, Do ye not know that the saints
   shall judge the world?' Ps. xlix. 14, The upright shall have dominion
   over them in the morning:' that is, in the morning of the resurrection
   the saints shall be assumed by God to assist in judicature, and shall
   arise in a glorious manner, when the earth shall give up her dead. If
   this be not enough for us to counterbalance the scorn of the world, we
   are not Christians.

   Use. To persuade us to hold on our course, notwithstanding all the
   scorns and reproaches which are cast upon the despised ways of God.
   Now, to this end I shall give you some directions.

   1. Be sure that you are in God's way, and that you have his law to
   justify your practice, and that you do not make his religion ridiculous
   by putting his glorious name upon any foolish fancies of your own. A
   man that differs from the rest of Christians had need of a very clear
   light, that he may honour so much of Christianity as is owned, and may
   be able to vindicate his own particular way wherein he is engaged. The
   world is loath to own anything of God, and needless dissents justify
   their prejudice. I know a Christian is not infallible; besides his
   general godly course, he may have his particular slips and errors; yet
   because the world is apt to take prejudice, we should not but upon the
   constraining evidence of conscience, enter upon any ways of dissent or
   contest, lest we justify their general hatred of godliness by our
   particular error.

   2. Take up the ways of God without a bias, and look straight for ward
   in a course of godliness: Prov. iv. 25, Let thine eyes look right on,
   and thine eyelids straight before thee:' that is, look not asquint upon
   any secular encouragements, but have thine eye to the end of the
   journey; make God as thy witness, so thy master and judge.

   3. Take heed of the first declinings. God's saints may decline some
   what in an hour of temptation, and yet be sincere in the main. Now evil
   is best stopped in the beginning: Heb. xii. 3, Consider him that
   endured such contradiction of sinners, lest ye be weary and faint iii
   your minds.' Weariness is a lesser, and fainting a higher degree of
   deficiency. I am weary before I faint, before the vital power retireth,
   and leaveth the outward part senseless.

   4. Since the proud scoff, encounter pride with humility. Mocking is far
   more grievous to the proud, who stand upon their honour, than to the
   lowly and humble. Therefore be not too desirous of the applause of men,
   especially of the blind and ungodly world; make no great matter of
   their contempt, and scorn, or slander.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LVIII.

   I have remembered thy judgments of old, Lord; and have comforted
   myself.--Ver. 52.

   THE man of God had complained in the former verse that the proud had
   him greatly in derision. His help against that temptation is recorded
   in this verse; where observe--

   1. David's practice, I have remembered thy judgments of old.

   2. The effect of that meditation, and have comforted myself.

   The explication will be by answering two questions:--

   1. What is meant by mishphatim, judgments? The word is used in
   scripture either for laws enacted, or judgments executed according to
   those laws. The one may be called the judgments of his mouth,' as Ps.
   cv. 5, Remember the marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
   and the judgments of his mouth:' the other, the judgments of his hand.
   As both will bear the name of judgments, so both may be said to be of
   old.' His decrees and statutes, which have an eternal equity in them,
   and were graven upon the heart of man in innocency, may well be said to
   be of old;' and because from the beginning of the world God hath been
   punishing the wicked, and delivering the godly in due time, his
   judiciary dispensations may be said to be so also. The matter is not
   much whether we interpret it of either his statutes or decrees, for
   they both contain matter of comfort, and we may see the ruin of the
   wicked in the word if we see it not in providence. Yet I rather
   interpret it of those righteous acts recorded in scripture, which God
   as a just judge hath executed in all ages, according to the promises
   and threatenings annexed to his laws. Only in that sense I must note to
   you, judgments imply his mercies in the deliverance of his righteous
   servants, as well as his punishments on the wicked; the seasonable
   interpositions of his relief for the one in their greatest distresses,
   as well as his just vengeance on the other, not withstanding their
   highest prosperities.

   2. What is meant by comfort? Comfort is the strengthening the heart
   against evil, when either--(1.) Faith is confirmed; (2.) Love to God
   increased; (3.) Hope made more lively.

   Now these providences of God, suited to his word, comforted David, had
   more power and force to confirm and increase these graces, than all
   their theistical scoffs to shake them; for he concluded from these in
   stances, that though the wicked flourish they shall perish, and though
   the godly be afflicted they shall be rewarded; and so his faith, and
   hope, and love to God, and adherence to his ways was much encouraged.
   Comfort is sometimes spoken of in scripture as an impression of the
   comforting Spirit, sometimes as a result from an act of our meditation;
   as here, I comforted myself.' These things are not contrary but
   subordinate. It is our duty to meditate on God's word and providence,
   and God blesseth it by the influence of his grace; and the Spirit may
   be said to comfort us, and we also may be said to comfort ourselves.

   Doct. That the remembrance of God's former dealings with his people,
   and their enemies in all ages, is a great relief in distress.

   The man of God is here represented as lying under the scorns and
   oppressions of the wicked. What did he do to relieve himself? I
   remembered thy judgments of old, and have comforted myself.' So
   elsewhere, this was his practice: Ps. lxxvii. 5, I considered the days
   of old, the years of ancient times:' again in the 11th and 12th verses,
   I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember thy works
   of old: I will meditate also of all thy works, and talk of thy doings:'
   yet again, Ps. cxliii. 5, I remember the days of old, I meditate on all
   thy works; I muse on the works of thy hands.' Thus did David often
   consider with what equity and righteousness, with what power and
   goodness, God carried on the work of his providence toward his people
   of old. The like he presseth on others; Ps. cv. 5, Remember the
   marvellous works which he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of
   his mouth.' Surely it is our duty, and it will be our comfort and
   relief.

   I shall despatch the point in these considerations:--

   1. That there is a righteous God who governeth the world. All things
   are not hurled up and down by chance, as if the benefit we receive were
   only a good hit, and the misery a mere misfortune. No; all things are
   ordered by a powerful, wise, and just God; his word doth not only
   discover this to us, but his works: Ps. lviii. 11, So that a man shall
   say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God
   that judgeth the earth;' that is, many times there are such providences
   that all that behold them shall see, and say that godliness and
   holiness are matters of advantage and benefit in this world, abstracted
   from the rewards to come, and so an infallible evidence that the world
   is not governed by chance, but administered by an almighty, all-wise,
   and most just providence. So elsewhere: Ps. ix. 16, The Lord is known
   by the judgments which he executeth;' by some eminent instances God
   showeth himself to be the judge of the world, and keepeth a petty
   sessions before the day of general assizes. Upon this account the
   saints beg the Lord to take off the veil from his providence, and to
   appear in protecting and delivering his children, and punishing their
   adversaries: Ps. xciv. 1, 2, O thou judge of the earth, show thyself.'
   He is the supreme governor of the world, to whom it belongeth to do
   right.

   2. This righteous God hath made a law according to which he will
   govern, and established it as the rule of commerce between him and his
   creatures. The precept is the rule of our duty, the sanction is the
   rule of his proceedings; so that by this law we know what we must do,
   and what we may expect from him. Man is not made to be law less and
   ungoverned, but hath a conscience of good and evil, for without the
   knowledge of God's will we cannot obey him; nor can we know his will,
   unless it be some way or other revealed. No man in his wits can expect
   that God should speak to us immediately and by oracle; we cannot endure
   his voice, nor can we see him and live. Therefore he revealed his mind
   by the light of nature and by scripture, which giveth us a clearer and
   more perfect knowledge of his will. Certainly those that live under
   that dispensation must expect that God will deal with them according to
   the tenor of it. The apostle telleth us, Rom. ii. 12, As many as have
   sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and as many as
   have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.' God hath been
   explicit and clear with them, to tell them what they should do and what
   they should expect.

   3. In the course of his dispensations he hath showed from the beginning
   of the world unto this day that he is not unmindful of this law, that
   the observance of this rule bringeth suitable blessings, and the
   violation of it the threatened judgments: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God
   is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men.' The impious and the unrighteous are breakers of either table, and
   the wrath of God is denounced and executed upon both, if there be any
   notorious violation of either; for in the day of God's patience he is
   not quick and severe upon the world: Heb. ii. 2, Every transgression
   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:' thereby his
   word is owned. Execution, we say, is the life of the law; it is but
   words without it, and can neither be a ground of sufficient hope in the
   promises, nor fear in the comminations. When punishments are inflicted
   it striketh a greater terror: when the offenders are punished, the
   observers rewarded, then it is a sure rule of commerce between us and
   God.

   4. That the remembrance of the most illustrious examples of his
   justice, power, and goodness, should comfort us, though we do not
   perfectly feel the effects of his righteous government.

   [1.] I will prove we are apt to suspect God's righteous administration
   when we see not the effects of it. When the godly are oppressed with
   divers calamities, and the wicked live a life of pomp and ease,
   flourishing in prosperity and power, according to their own heart's
   desire, they are apt to think that God taketh no care of worldly
   affairs, or were indifferent to good and evil, as those profane
   atheists, Mal. ii. 17, Every one that doth evil is good in the sight of
   the Lord, and he delighteth in him, or where is the God of judgment?'
   as if God took pleasure in wicked men, and were no impartial judge, or
   had no providence at all, or hand in the government of the world.
   Temptations to atheism begin ordinarily at the matter of God's
   providence. First men carve out a providence of their own, that God
   loveth none but whom he dealeth kindly with in the matters of the
   world; and if his dispensations be cross to their apprehensions, then
   his providence is not just. Nay, the people of God themselves are so
   offended that they break out into such words as these, Ps. lxxiii.
   11-13, How doth God know? is there knowledge in the Most High? Behold,
   these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in
   riches. Verily I have cleansed ray heart in vain, and washed my hands
   in innocency.' They dispute within themselves, Doth God indeed so
   discern and take notice of all this? How cometh it about that he
   permitteth them? for it is visible that the wicked enjoy the greatest
   tranquillity and prosperity, and have the wealth and greatness of the
   world heaped upon them: then what reward for purity of hearts or hands,
   or the strict exercise of godliness? Till God doth arise, and apply
   himself to vindicate his law, these are the thoughts and workings of
   men's hearts; at least, it is a great vexation and trouble even to the
   godly, and doth tempt them to such imaginations and surmises of God.

   [2.] I shall prove that the remembrance of his judgments of old is one
   means to confirm the heart, for so we are enabled to tarry till God's
   judgments be brought to the effect. We see only the beginning, and so,
   like hasty spectators, will not tarry till the last act, when all
   errors shall be redressed. We shall make quite another judgment of
   providence when we see it altogether, and do not judge of it by parts.
   Surely then they shall see there is a reward for the righteous; there
   is a God that judgeth the earth.' At first none seem so much to lose
   their labour, and to be disregarded by God as the righteous, or to be
   more hardly dealt withal; but let us not be too hasty in judging God's
   work, while it is a-doing, but tarry to the end of things. In the word
   of God we have not only promises which are more firm than heaven and
   earth, but instances and examples of the afflictions of the righteous
   and their deliverance; therefore let us but suspend our censure till
   God hath put his last hand unto the work, and then you will see that if
   his people seem to be forsaken for a while, it is that they may be
   received for ever. All is wont to end well with the children of God,
   let God alone with his own methods; after a walk in the wilderness, he
   will bring his people into a land of rest.

   But more particularly why his judgments of old are a comfort and relief
   to us.

   1. It is some relief to the soul to translate the thoughts from the
   present scene of things, and to consider former times. One cause of
   men's discomfort is to look only to the present, and so they are over
   whelmed; but when we look back, we shall find that others have been
   afflicted before us, it is no strange thing, and others delivered
   before us upon their dependence on God, and adherence to him. You were
   not the first afflicted servants of God, nor are likely to be the last.
   Others have been in the like case, and after a while delivered and
   rescued out of their trouble: Ps. xxii. 4, 5, Our fathers trusted in
   thee; they trusted, and thou didst deliver them; they cried unto thee,
   and were delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.' In
   looking back we see two things--the carriage of the godly, and their
   success, or the salvation of God: The patience of Job and the end of
   the Lord,' James v. 11. They trusted God, and trusted him patiently and
   constantly in all their troubles. At last this trust was not in vain;
   they were delivered, and not confounded; depending on God for rescue
   and deliverance, they never failed to receive it. Now, in looking back
   we look forward, and in their deliverance we see our own; at least, you
   are fortified against the present temptation, whilst you see his people
   in all ages have their difficulties and conflicts, and also their
   deliverances; so that you will not miscarry, nor be over-tempted by the
   present prosperity of the wicked: Ps. lxxiii. 17, I went into the
   sanctuary, and there understood I their end:' that is, entering into a
   sober consideration of God's counsels and providences, we may easily
   discern what is the ordinary conclusion of such men's felicities at
   last; they pay full dear for their perishing pleasures.

   2. Because these are instances of God's righteous government, and
   instances do both enliven and confirm all matters of faith. Here you
   see his justice. God hath ever been depressing the proud and exalting
   the humble, gracious to his servants, terrible to the wicked. These
   examples also of rescuing others who have been in like condition before
   us show us what the wisdom and omnipotency of God can do in performing
   promises. When the performance of them seemeth hopeless, and all lost
   and gone, then they are infallible evidences of his tenderness, care,
   and fidelity towards all that depend upon him. Now, though we have
   nothing of our own experience to support us, yet the remembrance of
   what hath been done for others, the experiences of the saints in
   scripture, are set down for our learning, for the support of our faith
   and hope. They trusted in God, and found him a ready help; why may not
   we? God is the same that he was in former times, and carrieth himself
   in the same ways of providence to righteous and unrighteous as
   heretofore; still promises are fulfilled, and threatenings are
   executed. They on whose behalf God showed himself so just, powerful,
   wise, good, and tender, had not a better God than we have, nor a more
   worthy Redeemer, nor a surer covenant. If they had a stronger faith, it
   is our own fault, and we should labour to increase it: the saints are
   as dear to God as ever. And as to the wicked, they that inherit others'
   sins shall inherit others' judgments. It is true, we live not in the
   age of wonders; but God's ordinary providence is enough for our turn,
   and those very wonders show that he hath power and love enough to
   protect and deliver us. Well, then, these are instances of his
   righteous government, and instances which concern us, which is my
   second reason.

   3. By these judgments of old you see the exact correspondency between
   his word and works. Where his voice is heard, but his hand not seen,
   his word is coldly entertained; but by his providence he establisheth
   the authority of his law. The word spoken by angels was logos bebaios,
   a steadfast word,' Heb. ii. 2. A word may be said to be steadfast
   either in respect of the unalterable will of the lawgiver, or in
   respect of execution, or with respect to the party to whom it is given,
   who firmly and certainly believeth it. The one maketh way for the
   other. God is resolved to govern the world by this rule, therefore he
   doth authorise it, own it by the dispensations of his providence;
   accordingly the world learneth to reverence it: Hosea vii. 12, I will
   chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.' God's word against
   sin and sinners will at last take effect, and end in sad chastisements;
   and they that would not believe their danger are made to feel it. Now
   his promises will have their effect as well as his threatenings: Micah
   ii. 7, Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?' The word
   of God doth not only speak good, but do good. The word's saying of
   good, is indeed doing of good. The performance is so certain, that when
   it is said it may be accounted done. We are apt to despise the word of
   God as an empty sound. No; it produceth notable effects in the world.
   The sentences that are there, whether of mercy or judgment, are decrees
   given forth by the great judge of the world; whereupon execution is to
   follow, as is foretold. Now, when we see it done, and can compare the
   Lord's word and work together, it is a mighty support to our faith,
   whether it be in our or in former ages. For you see the word is not a
   vain scarecrow in its threatenings, nor do we build castles in the air,
   when we do depend upon its promises: the judgments of his mouth will be
   the judgments of his hand, and providence is a real comment upon and
   proof of the truth of his word.

   4. God's judgments of old, or his wonderful works, were never in tended
   only for the benefit of that age in which they were done, but the
   benefit of all those who should hear of them by any credible means
   whatsoever. Surely God never intended they should be buried in dark
   oblivion, but that after-ages may be the better for the remembrance of
   them. Witness these scriptures: Ps. cxlv. 4, One generation shall
   praise thy works unto another, and remember thy mighty acts;' Joel i.
   3, Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children,
   and their children another generation.' So Ps. lxxviii. 3-7, That which
   we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us, we will not hide
   them from their children; showing the generations to come the praises
   of the Lord, and his wonderful works which he hath done: for he
   established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which
   he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their
   children, that the generation to come might know them, even the
   children to come, which should be born; who should arise and declare to
   their children, that they may set their hope in God, and not forget the
   works of the Lord, but keep his commandments, and might not be as their
   fathers,' &c. From all which places and many more I observe--

   [1.] That we should tell generations to come what we have found of God
   in our time, and that we should use all ways and means to transmit the
   knowledge of God's notable and wondrous providences for his people to
   posterity.

   [2.] That this report of God's former works is a special means of
   edification, for therefore God would have them recorded and told for
   the special benefit of the ages following.

   [3.] And more particularly that this is a great means and help of
   faith. For in one of the places it is said that they may set their
   faith and hope in God:' and from all we may conclude that, by
   remembering God's judgments of old, we may be much comforted; as in
   remembering God's works when the church was first reformed in Luther's
   time, the delivering of England from the Spanish invasion,
   gunpowder-treason, &c., for the confirming our faith and confidence m
   God. All God's judgments that were done in the days of our forefathers,
   and in all generations, if they come to our knowledge by a true report,
   or record, are of use to warn us and comfort us; yea, the bringing
   Israel out of Egypt and Babylon, or any notable work done since the
   beginning of the world till now.

   Use. The use is to press us to take this course as one remedy to
   comfort us in our distresses. In distresses of conscience the blood of
   Christ is the only cure; but in temptations arising from the scorn and
   insultation of enemies, remember what God hath done for his people of
   old, and let his providence support our faith: Ps. xxiii. 4, Thy rod
   and thy staff comfort me.' Pedum pastorale--for the protection and
   guiding of the sheep and driving away the wolf, the rod and staff are
   the instruments of the shepherd. More particularly consider--

   1. What is to be observed and remembered. All the eminent passages of
   God's providence, when acts of power have been seasonably interposed
   for the rescue of his people, judgments of all kind, public, universal,
   private and personal, our own experiences: 2 Cor. i. 10, Who delivered
   us from so great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust that he
   will yet deliver us.' The experiences of others, not in one, but in
   every age; for in every place and age God delighteth to leave a
   monument of his righteousness, and all is for the consolation and
   instruction of the church. Judgments in our time, judgments in former
   times, blow off the dust from old mercies, and the inscription of them
   will be a kind of prophecy to your faith. But especially cast your eye
   often upon the Lord's manner of dealing with his saints in scripture,
   their consolations and deliverances received after trouble; partly
   because the word of God is a rich storehouse of these instances and
   examples, and partly because of the infallibility of the record, where
   things are delivered to us with so much simplicity and truth; partly
   also because of the manner and ends in which and for which they are
   recorded. But if I would have recourse to scripture, should I not
   rather make use of the promises? Ans. We must not set one part of
   scripture against another; but examples do mightily help us to believe
   promises, as they are a pledge of the justice, faithfulness, care and
   love of God towards his people; and--I know not by what secret force
   and influence--invite us to hope for what God hath done for others of
   his servants.

   2. How they must be considered. Seriously, as everything that cometh
   from God. A slight consideration will not draw forth the profitable use
   of them. When they are looked on cursorily, or lightly passed by, the
   impression of God upon his works cannot be discerned, therefore they
   must be well considered, with all their circumstances: Ps. cxliii. 2,
   David sufficed not to say, I remember thy works of old,' but I meditate
   on all thy works; I muse on the works of thy hands;' Ps. lxxvii. 12, I
   remember thy works of old; I will meditate also of all thy works.' And
   surely this should be a delightful exercise to the children of God, as
   it is for the son of a noble and princely father to read the chronicles
   where his father's acts are recorded, or the famous achievements of his
   ancestors: Ps. cxi. 2, The works of the Lord are great, sought out of
   all them that have pleasure therein.' Some works of God have a large
   impression of his power and goodness, and they are made to be
   remembered, as it after followeth there. He is ready to do the like
   works when his church standeth in need thereof. Now they must be sought
   out, for there is more hid treasure and excellency in them than doth at
   first appear. He that would reap the use and benefit of them should
   take pleasure to search out matter of praise for God and trust for
   himself. Of all other study, this is the most worthy exercise and
   employment of godly men, to study and find out the works of God in all
   their purposes and designs; there is more pleasure in such meditations
   than in all other the most sensual divertisements.

   3. The end is to be strengthened and confirmed in the way of our duty,
   in dependence upon God, and adherence to him; or that faith may be
   strengthened in a day of affliction, and our hearts encouraged in
   cleaving to the ways of God.

   [1.] Dependence upon God, which implieth a committing ourselves to his
   power, a submitting ourselves to his will, and a waiting his leisure;
   all these are in trust, and all these are encouraged by remembering his
   judgments of old.

   (1.) Committing ourselves to his power is trust and dependence: Our God
   is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace, Dan. iii. 17; Rom. iv.
   21, Being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to
   perform.' Now this is abundantly seen in his judgments of old: Isa. li.
   9, Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the
   ancient days, in the generations of old. Art not thou he which hath cut
   Rahab, and wounded the dragon; which hast dried the sea, and the waters
   of the great deep?' If God will but take to himself his great power,
   and bestir himself as in ancient days, what should a believer fear?

   (2.) Submitting ourselves to God's will is a great act of dependence,
   submitting before the event. Now, how may a believer acquiesce in God's
   providence, and enjoy a quiet repose of heart? He knoweth not what God
   will do with him, but this he knoweth, he hath to do with a good God,
   who is not wont to forsake those that depend upon him; he hath wisdom
   and goodness enough to deliver us, or to make our troubles profitable
   to us. Now his judgments of old do much help to breed this composedness
   of mind: Ps. ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their trust in
   thee; for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.' They that
   know anything of God's wont, and have learned from others, or
   experimented themselves, or by searching into the records of time have
   found with what wisdom and power, justice and mercy, God governeth the
   world, will be firmly grounded in their trust and reliance on these,
   without applying themselves to any of the sinful aids or policies of
   the world for succour, or troubling themselves about success; for God
   never forsook any godly man in his distress, that by prayer and faith
   made his humble and constant applications to him.

   (3.) If you take in the third thing, tarrying or waiting God's leisure;
   for he that believeth will not make haste,' Isa. xxvi. 16. God will
   tarry to try his people, to observe his enemies, till their sins are
   full, and tarry to bring about his -providences in the best time: 1
   Peter v. 6, Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,
   that he may exalt you,' i.e. deliver you, in due time.' It may be he
   will not at all afford temporal deliverance, but will refer it to the
   time when he will judge the world in righteousness,' Acts xvii. 31.
   Now, what will relieve the soul, engage it to wait? His judgments of
   old; at the long run the good cause hath prevailed, the suppressed
   truth hath got up, the buried Christ hath risen again, and after
   labours and patience the fruit sown hath been reaped; therefore in due
   time he will look upon our afflictions; in the sanctuary we understand
   the end of things: the beginnings are troublesome, but the end is
   peace.

   [2.] Adherence to God; this followeth necessarily from the former, for
   dependence begets observance. Till a man trusts God he can never be
   true to him; for the evil heart of unbelief' will draw us from the
   living God,' Heb. iii. 12; but if we can depend upon him, temptations
   have lost their force. The great cause of all defection is the desire
   of some present sensible benefit, and we cannot tarry God's leisure,
   nor wait for his help in the way of our duty. Now, if God's people of
   old have trusted, and were never confounded, it is a great engagement
   in the way of his judgments to wait for him without miscarrying.

   A case of conscience may be propounded: How could David be comforted by
   God's judgments, for it seemeth a barbarous thing to delight in the
   destruction of any? It is said, Prov. xvii. 5, He that is glad of
   calamities shall not be unpunished.'

   Ans. 1. It must be remembered that judgment implies both parts of God's
   righteous dispensation--the deliverance of the godly and the punishment
   of the wicked. Now, in the first sense, there is no ground of scruple;
   for it is said, Ps. xciv. 15, Judgment shall return to righteousness:'
   the sufferings of good men shall be turned into the greatest advantage;
   as the context showeth that God will not cast off his people, but
   judgment shall return unto righteousness.

   Ans. 2. Judgment, as it signifieth punishment of the wicked, may jet be
   a comfort, not as it importeth the calamity of any, but either--

   1. When the wicked are punished, the snare and allurement to sin is
   taken away, which is the hope of impunity; for by their punishments we
   see it is dangerous to sin against God: Isa. xxvi. 9, When thy
   judgments are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
   learn righteousness,' the snare is removed from many a soul.

   2. Their derision and mockage of godliness ceaseth; they do no longer
   vex and pierce the souls of the godly, saying, Aha! aha!' Ps. xl. 15,
   It is as a wound to their heart when they say, Where is your God,' Ps.
   xlii. 10.

   3. The impediments and hindrances of worshipping and serving God are
   taken away: when the nettles are rooted up the corn hath more room to
   grow.

   4. Opportunity of molesting God's servants is taken away, and
   afflicting the church by their oppressions, and so way is made for the
   enlarging of Christ's kingdom.

   5. As God's justice is manifested: Prov. xi. 10, When it goeth well
   with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; but when the wicked perish,
   there is shouting;' Ps. lii. 6, The righteous also shall see, and fear,
   and shall laugh at him: Lo! this is the man that made not God his
   portion:' Rev. xviii. 20, Rejoice over Babylon, ye holy apostles and
   prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.' When the word of God is
   fulfilled, surely then we may rejoice that his justice and truth are
   cleared.

SERMON LIX.

   Horror hath taken hold on me, because of the wicked which forsake thy
   law.--Ver. 53.

   THE man of God in the former verse had showed what comfort he took in
   remembering God's judgments of old, meaning thereby his righteous
   dispensations in delivering the godly, and punishing the wicked. He now
   showeth that, seeing God's horrible judgments on the wicked, he was
   seized and stricken with a very great fear.

   In the words observe--

   1. A great passion described.

   2. The cause of it assigned.

   1. A great passion described, horror hath taken hold on me. The word
   for horror signifieth also a tempest or storm. Translations vary; some
   read it, as Junius, a storm overtaking me; Ainsworth, a burning horror
   hath seized me, and expoundeth it a storm of terror and dismay; the
   Septuagint, athumi'a kate'sche me, faintness and dejection of mind hath
   possessed me; our old translation, I am horribly afraid. All
   translations, as well as the original word, imply a great trouble of
   mind, and a vehement commotion like a storm. It was matter of disquiet
   and trembling to David.

   2. What is the matter? The reason is given in the latter clause,
   because of the wicked which forsake thy law. Now this reason may be
   supposed to be--

   [1.] Either because of the storm of trouble raised by them, or
   persecution from them; and so it would note the outrageousness of those
   who have cast off the yoke, all fear of God, and respect to his law;
   and so also the imbecility and weakness of the saints, who are not able
   to stand against violent evils and assaults of temptation. But this is
   not so consistent with David's constancy and comfort, asserted in the
   former verses.

   [2.] Because of the detriment and loss which might accrue to the
   public; they bring on common judgments and calamities. It is a Jewish
   proverb that two dry sticks will set a green one afire: One sinner
   destroyeth much good,' Eccles. ix. 18, much more mercy. [1] Now the
   godly, which believe God's word, are troubled when they see wickedness
   increaseth; they know this will turn to loss and ruin in the issue;
   therefore it causeth a grievous horror and indignation to seize upon
   them, for they have a tender and public spirit.

   [3.] Besides the common calamities which they might bring upon others,
   the sore punishment which they would bring upon themselves was a horror
   to him, which showeth a charitable affection to enemies. The
   punishment, which had not as yet seized upon them, nor did they think
   of it, yet being prepared for their wickedness by the justice of God,
   was a grief and trouble to David, as it is to all good men, to see the
   wicked run on to their own destruction and condemnation. These two last
   senses I prefer.

   Doct. It argueth a good spirit to be grieved to see God's laws broken,
   and to be stricken with fear because of those judgments which come from
   God by reason of the wickedness of the wicked. The reasons are:--

   First, Here is matter of great commotion of spirit to any attentive and
   serious beholder; for the cause assigned in the text is, because they
   forsake thy law.' There are two things in the law--the precept and the
   sanction, by penalties and rewards. Now, they that forsake the law
   violate the precept and slight the sanction; and so two things grieve
   the godly--their sin and their punishment, how grievously they sin, and
   what grievous punishments they may expect!

   1. That the law is violated, that they should forsake God, and all
   thoughts of obedience to him, and so make light of his law. Sin is
   anomi'a, 1 John iii. 4, the transgression of the law;' a contempt of
   God's authority. If we consider the intrinsic evil of sin, we shall see
   that it is not a small thing, but a horrible evil in itself; a thing
   not to be laughed at, but feared, whether our own or others.

   [1.] There is folly in it, as it is a deviation from the best rule
   which the divine wisdom hath set unto us. If we should look upon the
   law of God as a bare direction or counsel given us by one that is wiser
   than we, it is a contempt of the wisdom of God, as if he knew not how
   to govern the world, and what is good and meet for man, so much as he
   himself; and so a poor worm is exalted above God: Micah vi. 8, He hath
   showed thee, O man, what is good.' Now shall we slight his direction,
   and in effect say our own way is better? Reason requireth that they who
   cannot choose for themselves should obey their guides, and since they
   are not wise for themselves, content themselves with the wisdom of
   others who see farther than they do, as Elymas the sorcerer, when he
   was struck blind, sought about for somebody to lead him by the hand,'
   Acts xiii. 11. Can a blind man feel out his way better than another who
   hath eyes to choose it for him? God is wiser than we, and all who would
   not contemn their creator should think so. He hath reduced the sum of
   our duty into a holy law; now for us after all this to run of our
   heads, and to consult with our foolish lusts and the suggestions of the
   devil, who is our worst enemy, is extreme folly and madness, and so
   doth every one who breaketh the laws of God.

   [2.] Laws are not only to direct, but have a binding power and force
   from the authority of the lawgiver. God doth not only give us counsel
   as a friend, but commandeth us as a sovereign; and so the second notion
   whereby the evil of sin is set forth, is that of disobedience and
   rebellion; and so it is a great injury done to God, because it is a
   depreciation and contempt of his authority. As Pharaoh said, Exod. v.
   2, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?' or those rebels, Ps.
   xii, 4, Our tongues are our own; who is Lord over us?' We will speak
   and think and do what we please, and own no law but our own lusts. Now,
   though sinners do not say so in so many direct and formal words, yet
   this is the interpretation of their sinful actions. Whenever they sin,
   they despise the law which forbiddeth that sin, and so by consequence
   the authority of him that made it: 2 Sam. xii. 9, 10, Wherefore hast
   thou sinned in despising the commandment?' Tush! I will do it; it is no
   matter for the law of God that standeth in the way, is the language of
   the corrupt and obstinate heart. Now no man can endure to have his will
   crossed by an inferior, and will God take it at their hands? And
   therefore the children of God, who have a great reverence of God's
   authority, when they see it so openly violated and contemned, are
   filled with horror. Will not God be tender of his power and
   sovereignty? will he see his authority so lightly esteemed, and take no
   notice of it?

   [3.] It is shameful ingratitude. Man is God's beneficiary, from whom he
   hath received life and being, and all things, and therefore is bound to
   love him and serve him according to his declared will. We continually
   depend upon him every moment: In him we live, and move, and have our
   being,' Acts xvii. 28; and surely dependence should beget observance,
   and therefore men should be loath to break with God, or careful to
   reconcile themselves to him on whom they depend every moment: Acts xii.
   20, Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon; but they
   came with one accord to him, and having made Blastus, the king's
   chamberlain, their friend, desired peace; because their country was
   nourished by the king's country.' Therefore it is extreme
   unthankfulness, stupidity, and brutishness for them to carry themselves
   so unthankfully towards God, who giveth them life and being, and all
   things. The brutes themselves, who have no capacity to know God as the
   first cause of all being, yet take notice of the next hand from whence
   they receive their supplies: Isa. i. 3, The ox knows his owner, and the
   ass his master's crib;' and in their kind express their gratitude to
   such as feed them, and make much of them; but wicked men take no notice
   of the God who hath made them, and kept them at the expense and care of
   his providence, and hath been beneficial to them all their days; but as
   they slight their lawgiver, so they requite their great benefactor with
   unkindness and provocation.

   [4.] It is a disowning of his propriety in them, as if they were not
   his own, and God had not power to do with his own as he pleaseth. The
   creature is absolutely at God's dispose, not only as he hath a
   jurisdiction over us as our lawgiver and king over his subjects, but as
   a proprietary and owner over his goods. A prince hath a more absolute
   power over his lands and goods than over his subjects. God is not only
   a ruler but an owner, as he made us out of nothing, and bought us when
   worse than nothing, and still keepeth us from returning into our
   original nothing; and shall those who are absolutely his own with draw
   themselves from him, and live according to their own will, and speak
   and do what they list? What is this but a plain denial of God's
   propriety and lordship over us? as those, Ps. xii. 4, Who have said,
   With our tongues will we prevail, our lips are our own; who is Lord
   over us?' Surely it should strike us with horror to think that any
   creatures should thus take upon them. Sin robbeth God of his propriety
   in the creatures. If we consider his natural right, sin is such an
   injury and wrong to God as theft and robbery. If we consider our own
   covenant, as we voluntarily acknowledge God's propriety in us, so it is
   adultery, breach of marriage vow; and with respect to the devoting and
   consecrating ourselves to him, so it is sacrilege.

   [5.] It is a contempt of God's glorious majesty. What else shall we
   make of a plain contest with him, or a flat contradiction of his holy
   will? For whilst we make our depraved will the rule and guide of our
   actions against his holy will, we plainly contend with him whose will
   shall stand, his or ours, and so jostle him out of the throne, and
   pluck the crown off his head and the sceptre out of his hands, and
   usurp his authority; and so slight the eternal power of this glorious
   king, as if he were not able to avenge the wrong done to his majesty,
   and we could make good our party against him: 1 Cor. x. 22, Do we
   provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?' Isa. xlv. 9,
   Woe to him that striveth with his Maker; let the potsherd strive with
   the potsherds of the earth.' Surely they that strive with their Maker
   will find God too hard for them. Now all these and many more
   considerations should make a serious Christian sensible, when he
   considereth how God is dishonoured in the world.

   2. Their punishment. This relateth to the sanction by penalties and
   rewards. They that forsake the law have quite divested themselves of
   all hope, and cast off all dread of him. The law offereth death or life
   to the transgressors and observers of it: Deut. xxx. 15, Behold, I have
   set before you good and life, death and evil.' Now this is as little
   believed as the precept is obeyed; and thence cometh all their boldness
   in sinning and coldness in duty.

   [1.] God allureth us to obedience by promises of this world and the
   next, which, if they were believed, men would be more forward and ready
   to comply with his will. As to the promises of the next world, lie hath
   told us of eternal life. Surely God meaneth as he speaketh in his word,
   he will make good his word to the obedient; but the sinner thinketh not
   so, and therefore is loath to undergo the difficulties of obedience,
   because he hath so little sense and certainty of fulfil ling the
   promise. The apostle telleth us, Heb. xi. 6, That without faith it is
   impossible to please God, for he that cometh to God must believe that
   he is, and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently serve him;'
   implying that if the fundamental truths of God's being and bounty were
   believed, we could not be so careless as we are, not so barren and
   unfruitful as we are; but unbelief lieth at the bottom of all our
   carelessness: 1 Cor. xv. 58, Be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your
   labour is not in vain in the Lord.' They that know what a reward is
   prepared for the righteous, cannot but be serious and diligent
   themselves, and pity others, and be troubled at their neglect. Oh! what
   a good God they deprive themselves of, and throw away their souls for a
   trifle! But because the Lord knoweth how apt we are to be led by things
   present to sense, that work strongly upon our apprehensions; and that
   things absent and future lie in another world, and wanting the help of
   sense to convey them to our minds, make little impression upon our
   hearts; therefore God draws us to our duty by present benefits. Even
   carnal nature is apt to be pleased with these kinds of mercies,
   protection, provision, and worldly comforts: Ps. cxix. 56, This I had,
   because I kept thy precepts:' Mat vi. 33, Seek ye first the kingdom of
   God, and the righteousness thereof, and all these thing shall be added
   to you;' 1 Tim. iv. 8, Godliness is profitable to all things, having
   the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.' But
   alas! the naughty heart cannot depend on God for the effects of his
   common goodness. Men distrust providence, and therefore take their own
   course, which is a grief and trouble to a gracious heart, to see they
   cannot depend on God for things of a present accomplishment.

   [2.] The other part of the sanction is his threatenings and
   punishments. Now in what a direful condition are all the deserters of
   God's law! Besides the loss of heaven, there is eternal fire, which is
   the portion of the wicked: Ps. xi. 6, Upon the wicked he will rain
   snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest; this shall be the
   portion of their cup.' They may flourish for a time, yet at length
   sudden, terrible, and irremediable destruction shall be the portion of
   their cup. God's judgments are terrible and unavoidable, both here and
   hereafter: Eph. v. 6, For these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
   children of disobedience;' Rom. ii. 9, Tribulation, wrath, and anguish
   upon the soul of man that doth evil.' Alas! these things are slighted
   by wicked men, or else they would not venture as they do; you cannot
   drive a dull ass into the fire that is kindled before him: Prov. i. 17,
   In vain is the snare laid in the sight of any bird;' and would a
   reasonable creature wilfully run into such a danger if he were sensible
   of it, and venture upon so dreadful threatenings if he did believe
   them? No; they think it is but a vain scarecrow, a deceitful terror, or
   a false flash of fire, and therefore embolden themselves in their
   rebellion. But God's people, that know the certainty of these things,
   they cannot but conceive a great horror at it when they think of the
   end of these men, their judgments in this world, but especially their
   eternal condemnation in the world to come. Well, then, forsaking the
   law, despising the precept, and slighting the sanction, should be a
   matter of great horror to a tender and gracious spirit.

   Secondly, It argueth that they have a due sense of things, though
   others have not.

   1. They have a due sense of the evil of sin: Prov. xiv. 9, Fools make a
   mock of sin;' they sport at it, and jest at it, and count it nothing;
   but gracious and tender hearts have other apprehensions; they know that
   this is a violation of the holy and righteous and good law of God, and
   that it will be bitter in the issue, and that they which had pleasure
   in unrighteousness shall be damned. They look upon it with sad hearts,
   though it be committed by others, that the wicked go dancing to hell,
   and are angry with those who mourn for them, and dislike that vain
   course which they affect.

   2. They have a due sense of the wrath of God. The prophet that
   threatened it saith, that rottenness entered into his bones, and his
   bowels quivered,' Hab. iii. 16. A lion trembleth to see a dog beaten
   before him. It is a trouble to the godly to think of the horrible
   punishments of the wicked, which they dread not, nor dream of; but the
   saints have a reverence for their Father's anger. Search the
   scriptures, and you shall find that the godly are more troubled at
   God's judgments than the wicked themselves who are to feel them: Dan.
   iv. 19, Daniel was astonished for an hour, and his thoughts troubled
   him,' when he was to reveal God's judgments against Nebuchadnezzar. So
   the prophet, Jer. iv. 19, My bowels, my bowels; I am pained at the very
   heart;' ver. 22, But my people are foolish, they are sottish children;'
   they, that brought the evil upon themselves, are senseless and stupid:
   Ps. xc. 11, Who knows the power of thine anger? according to thy fear,
   so is thy wrath.' Few lay to heart the terrible effects of God's heavy
   wrath; but the righteous do; they are truly affected with it, and with
   the cause of it, which is sin. God's wrath affects men according to the
   reverence and fear wherewith they entertain it, but to the wicked it is
   but a vain and empty terror.

   3. The certainty of the threatenings. God's people see wrath and
   judgment in the face of sin, whereas those who are drowned in
   sensuality and carnal delights scoff at God's menaces and jest at his
   judgments, neither crediting the one nor expecting the other, as if it
   were but a mere mockery: Isa. v. 19, Come, say they, let him make
   speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it.' In their security they
   will believe nothing but what they feel.

   4. The bane which cometh to communities and societies from the increase
   of the wicked, especially when their wickedness groweth to an height;
   that is, when it is committed with boldness: Isa iii. 9, They declare
   their sin as Sodom, they hide it not;' when men have lost all shame and
   modesty, and will not be restrained by any law. Surely if we know the
   evil of sin, the terribleness of God's wrath, believe the truth of his
   threatenings, and then consider the danger that will come to our
   dearest country, we cannot but be greatly moved. If a man were sailing
   in a bark, and see it guided so that it must necessarily run against a
   rock and suffer shipwreck, he would be sorry and deeply affected.

   Thirdly, It cometh from a good cause.

   1. In the general it argueth a good constitution of soul: 2 Peter ii.
   8, For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing,
   vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.'
   Passively he was vexed with the impurity of the Sodomites, and actively
   he vexed himself. So far as we are carnal we are pleased with sin, so
   far as we are spiritual we are vexed with it: Isa. lxiii. 10, They
   rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.' The better any are, the more
   affected with public sins and judgments. Christ weepeth over Jerusalem
   for their impenitency and approaching desolation: Luke xix. 41, 42, As
   he came near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou
   hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which
   belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.' This was
   in the midst of the acclamations and hosannahs of the multitude, when
   he was welcomed with a triumph. Paul telleth the Corinthians, 2 Cor.
   xii. 21, I am afraid, when I come among you, my God will humble me, and
   I shall bewail many which have not repented of the fornication,
   lasciviousness, and uncleanness which they have committed.' The more
   holy any one is, the more he is affected and struck at heart with the
   sins of others.

   2. A deep resentment of God's dishonour. When his glory is obscured, it
   is a wound to the hearts of his children; as a child cannot endure to
   hear or see his father disgraced. Surely God's glory is dear to the
   saints: Ps. lxix. 9, The reproaches of them that reproached thee are
   fallen upon me.' Injuries done to God and religion affect them no less
   nearly than personal injuries which are done to themselves. So
   affectionately zealous are they for God's honour, which is obscured by
   the wickedness of the wicked, who forsake the perfect righteous law of
   God, and, usurping God's authority, make a new law to themselves.

   3. Compassion to men. Though they are wicked men, yet they are men,
   made after God's image, remotely capable to know and love God, and live
   with him for ever, whom they should otherwise embrace as brethren; to
   see them treasure up wrath against the day of wrath should be a grief
   and a trouble to us; to think of the everlasting; destruction which
   they will bring upon themselves should afflict us. Thus the apostle:
   Phil iii. 18, 19, Of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
   weeping, that they are enemies to the cross of Christ, whose end is
   destruction.' To see men go by droves to hell, it should work on our
   bowels. If this brought Christ out of heaven to die for sinners, surely
   this should make us sadly resent their condition.

   4. This produceth good effects; it is a disposition of great use and
   profit to us.

   [1.] It deterreth us from sinning ourselves, and so we are kept from
   being tainted with the contagion of evil examples; for what we mourn
   for in others we will not commit ourselves. The heart is made more
   averse from sin every day by this practice, whereas those that take
   pleasure in the sins of others do the same things, Rom. i. 32, consent
   with them to dishonour God, and so howl among the wolves, as the Latin
   proverb is; but when this is a trouble to us, it maketh us avoid their
   example, notwithstanding terrors and allurements to the contrary;
   terrors from the angry world, who cannot endure that any should part
   company; and allurements from our commodious living among the
   offenders. Thus Lot escaped in Sodom, because his righteous soul was
   vexed;' and Noah was upright in his generation,' because he reproved
   the deeds of the wicked.

   [2.] When we see their punishment in their sin, and fear a storm when
   the clouds are gathering, it puts us upon mourning and humiliation,
   which is a necessary duty in evil times: Jer. xiii. 17, If you will not
   hear, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride.' None do so
   feelingly bewail the sins of the times as those who have a tender holy
   heart, affected with God's dishonour, and compassion over the souls of
   men. Others do personate a mourning, and act a part in a fast, as the
   mourning women among the Jews did at funerals, or as the boys in the
   streets would act their festivities and lamentations: Mat. xi. 16, 17,
   Whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children
   sitting in the market, and calling to their fellows, and saying, We
   have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you,
   and ye have not lamented.' Therefore it is of great use to us to get
   this frame of spirit.

   J3; ] It maketh us more careful to reform others, so far as it lieth
   within our power. Certainly without this disposition a man will never
   seek the conversion of souls for which Christ died; but have it once,
   and then you will take all occasions to do good to the souls of your
   children, and relations, and neighbours. When Paul was stirred in
   spirit, paroxu'neto to` pneuma, exasperated within himself, because he
   saw the whole city given to idolatry, He disputed with them daily in
   the market-place,' and took all occasions to reclaim them. So if you
   were affected with the evil of sin, horribleness of wrath, certainty of
   the word of God, and the bane that cometh to any society by having the
   wicked amongst them, would you let your children, and servants, or
   friends go on in a damning course? Would you not have compassion on
   them, and pluck them out of the fire? Surely this should be the temper
   of every minister when he hath to do with sinners, that his ministry
   may not be a sleepy ministry; of every parent and house holder, that
   all under his roof may be found in the way of the Lord; of every
   Christian towards his friends.

   [4.] It justifieth our zeal in reproving. Surely reproof had need to be
   managed with great tenderness and compassion, that it may not seem to
   flow from hatred and ill-will to the persons reproved, nor from
   petulancy of spirit, nor a desire of venting reproaches, but from pure
   zeal to the glory of God, grief to see him dishonoured, souls in danger
   to be lost, or hardened through the deceitfulness of sin; therefore
   holy men, in their sharpest invectives against sin, or oppositions of
   it, have always mingled compassion: Mark iii. 5, Our Lord looked about
   with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts.' There was
   more of compassion than passion in our Lord Jesus Christ; he was angry,
   but grieved. So Paul, when he disputed earnestly against the Jews, yet
   telleth us, Rom. ix. 2, I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in
   my heart;' as much love to the persons of his countrymen as zeal
   against their errors. So flens dico, I tell you weeping, they are
   enemies to the cross of Christ,' Phil. iii. 18. Though he discovereth
   them to be enemies to the cross of Christ, yet he wept for their sakes
   and the church's sake.

   [5.] Those that are grieved and troubled even to some degree of horror
   and trembling of heart, for the prevailing of iniquity in those places
   and persons among whom they live, are delivered from the common
   judgment. So 2 Peter ii. 7, He delivered just Lot, vexed with the
   filthy conversation of the wicked:' and those that mourned and sighed
   for all the abominations which were committed in the midst of the
   land,' were marked out for preservation. The Lord hath a special care
   of them in times of public calamity.

   Use 1. Of reproof; it condemneth--

   1. Them that take pleasure in nothing so much as in the company of the
   ungodly, where they hear God dishonoured, his laws broken: if they were
   horribly afraid of the wicked which forsake God's law, how could this
   be? All conversation with the wicked is not forbidden, for then we must
   go out of the world; and to some we are bound by the law of necessity,
   or some civil and religious or natural bond; yet we are to eschew all
   unnecessary and voluntary fellowship and familiarity with them: Ps.
   xxvi. 4, I have not sat with vain persons, nor gone in with
   dissemblers.' So Prov. xxii. 24, 25, Make no friendship with an angry
   man; and with a froward man thou shalt not go; lest thou learn his
   ways, and get a snare to thy soul.' Certainly we are not to delight in
   the openly wicked as the only company that is pleasant to us, for what
   can a tender Christian get among them but a wound to his soul?

   2. Those that are not affected with their own sins, much less with the
   sins of others. It is but a deceit of heart to declaim against the sins
   of the times, and not to mourn bitterly for our own sins: this is to
   translate the scene of our humiliation, and to put it far off from
   ourselves. Surely that grief will be most pungent and afflicting which
   doth most concern ourselves, and we know more by ourselves than
   possibly we can by other men; therefore we should often think of the
   merit of our own sins, their heinous nature, their dreadful
   consequences, if God be not the more merciful to keep us humble and
   thankful.

   Use 2. To persuade us to be of this temper, to be deeply affected when
   we see God's laws broken. It requireth--

   1. The general grace of a soft heart, which must be asked of God: 2
   Chron. xxxiv. 27, Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble
   thyself, when thou heardest the words of the Lord against this place.'
   There was a high peace and calm at that time, but a tender heart
   relenteth at the threatenings. Beg of God to soften thy heart.

   2. There needeth eminent holiness for such a frame, that we shine as
   lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, Phil. ii. 15.
   The mourners must not be infected and tainted themselves, but save
   themselves from an untoward generation, condemn the sins of the times
   by their conversation.

   3. We must have a fear animated by faith: By faith Noah was moved by
   fear' concerning things unseen, Heb. xi. 7. The danger of the flood was
   unseen as yet, and they married and gave in marriage. We must not judge
   of things by the present, or by carnal appearance: there is a righteous
   judge in heaven. Faith in his word will show us our danger, for God's
   threatenings are all fulfilled, and the more we seek to establish
   ourselves by carnal means, the more our ruin is hastened.

   4. There must be a grief set awork by a love to God and the souls of
   men. In calamities the true temper for humiliation is a due sense of
   our Father's anger, and brethren's miseries: in sins our Father's
   dishonour, and man's destruction; those who are the same flesh with
   ourselves. Now it should trouble us to see them in the way to eternal
   ruin: Of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save
   with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
   spotted with the flesh,' Jude 22, 23.

SERMON LX.

   Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.--Ver.
   54.

   DAVID had in the former verse expressed his great trouble, because of
   the increase of the wicked, and their defection from the law of God.
   Now he showeth what comforted him: the children of God have a great
   deal of divine consolation from the word in the midst of all their
   sorrows and evils of the present life. David's comfort is here
   expressed--

   1. By the matter or object of it, thy statutes.

   2. The degree of his rejoicing, intimated in the word songs. The effect
   is put for the cause, joy and mirth, which usually break forth into
   singing, or the sign and indication for the thing signified.

   3. The place where he rejoiced, in the house of his pilgrimage; en
   to'po paroiki'as mou, wheresoever I sojourn.

   1. By God's statutes' is meant his word in general, more especially the
   precepts and promises: in the one we have the offer of life; in the
   other, the way and means how to attain it. In the word is both our
   charter and our rule; in both regards it is matter of rejoicing: Ps.
   xix. 8, The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the soul.'
   Nothing is commanded there but what is equitable in itself, and
   profitable to us.

   2. By songs,' a metonymy of the effect for the cause, or the sign for
   the thing signified; such pleasure, joy, and contentment as other men
   had in songs, David had in the word of God. Travellers use to lighten
   and ease the tediousness of the way by songs: Thy word doth comfort me
   wonderfully. Or you may take it literally, the themes and arguments of
   his singing. Profane spirits must have songs suit able to their mirth;
   as their mirth is carnal, so the songs of carnal men are obscene,
   filthy and fleshly: but a holy man, his songs suit his mirth and joy;
   he rejoiceth in the Lord, and therefore his songs are divine: Thy
   statutes are my songs.' Singing of psalms is a delectable way of
   edification, which God hath not only instituted in the scriptures, but
   heathens saw a use of it by the light of nature. Ælian, lib. iii. Nat.
   Hist. cap. 39, telleth us of the Cretans, tou`s paidas tou`s
   eleuthe'rous mantha'nein tou`s no'mous meta' tinos melodi'as. It is a
   spiritual channel wherein our mirth may run: James v. 13, Is any merry?
   let him sing psalms,' enthumei tis;--there is the harmony, that is a
   natural delight; the matter, that is a spiritual comfort. I cannot
   exclude this, because it is one way of expressing that delight which we
   take in the word; but I prefer the former, for David speaketh of the
   comfort he took in keeping God's precepts when they were violated by
   others.

   3. In the house of my pilgrimage.' You may take it literally for the
   time of David's exile, when banished by Saul, or driven from his palace
   by Absalom: when he fled from place to place, and wandered up and down
   in great distress, then God's statutes, by which his life was directed,
   innocency vindicated, hopes confirmed both of present sup port and
   seasonable deliverance, were as songs to him, his real and cordial
   solaces. Wheresoever the believer is, or whatsoever his case and
   condition be, he hath still matter of rejoicing in the word of God. So
   had David when he was exposed to continual wanderings, without any
   fixed habitation. Indeed the children of God in Babylon say, Ps.
   cxxxvii. 4, How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?' The
   meaning is not to exclude their own spiritual delight and solace; but
   they would not gratify the carnal pleasure of their enemies with a
   temple song, or subject religion to their sportive fancies and humours.
   Rather metaphorically for the whole course of his life, whether spent
   in the palace, or in the wilderness; in whatsoever place he was, he was
   still in the house of his pilgrimage: so he accounted his best and his
   worst condition; compare ver. 19, I am a stranger in the earth,' and
   Ps. xxxix. 12, I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my
   fathers were;' with 1 Chron. xxix. 15, We are strangers before thee,
   and sojourners, as were all our fathers.' Not only when hunted like a
   partridge upon the mountains, but also when he was at rest, and able to
   offer so vast a quantity of treasure for the building of the house of
   God.

   Two points are observable:--

   Doct. 1. That the godly count this world, and their whole estate
   therein, the house of their pilgrimage.

   Doct. 2. That during this estate, and the inconveniences thereof, they
   find matter of rejoicing in the word of God.

   Doct. 1. That the godly count, this world and their whole estate
   therein, the house of their pilgrimage.

   I shall not handle this doctrine in its full latitude, having spoken
   largely thereof in the 19th verse; only now a few considerations.

   1. Here is no fixed abode; there where we live longest we count our
   home and dwelling; not an inn which we take up in our passage, but the
   place of our constant residence in this world. We are only in passage,
   and so should consider it: Heb. xiii. 14, Here we have no abiding city,
   but we look for one to come, whose builder and maker is God.' Here we
   stay but a little while, passing through to a better country. The
   mortality of the body and the immortality of the soul showeth that we
   are all strangers here; for if here we do not live for ever, and yet we
   have souls that will live for ever, there must be some other place to
   which we are tending. The body is dust in its composition and
   resolution: Eccles. xii. 7, Then shall the body return to the earth as
   it was.' Nature may teach us so much, but faith, that assureth us of
   the resurrection of the dead, doth more bind this consideration upon
   us. We are mortal, and all things about us are liable to their
   mortality; and therefore here we must be still passing to another
   place.

   2. Here we have no rest: Micah ii. 10, Arise, and depart hence, for
   this is not your rest:' that is hereafter; Heb. iv. 9, There remaineth
   therefore a rest for the people of God.' Our home we count the place of
   our repose. Now there is no rest and content in this world, which is a
   place of vanity, misery, and discomfort. Yea, to the children of God
   there are stronger motives than crosses to drive them from the
   world--daily temptations, and our often falling by them. Crosses are
   grievous to all, but sin is more grievous to the godly; and nothing
   makes them more weary of the world than the constant in dwelling and
   frequent outbreaking of corruption and sin: Rom. vii. 24, O miserable
   man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' The
   apostle was exercised with many crosses, but this doth make him
   complain in the bitterness of his soul, not of his misery, but of his
   corruption, which he found continually rebelling against God. Many
   complain of their crosses that complain not of sin. To loathe the world
   for crosses alone, is neither the mark nor work of grace. A beast can
   forsake the place where he findeth neither meat nor rest; but because
   we are sinning here, whilst others are glorifying God, this is the
   trouble of the saints.

   3. They believe and look for a better estate after this life is over: 2
   Cor. v. 1, We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens.' No man can be a right sojourner on earth who
   doth not look for an abode in heaven; for that which doth most
   effectually draw off the heart of man from this world is the
   expectation of a far better state in the world to come: 2 Cor. iv. 18,
   While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
   are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the
   things which are not seen are eternal.' Heathens could call the world
   an inn, but they had only glimmering conceptions of another world. A
   Christian, that believeth it, and looketh for it on God's assurance, he
   is only the joyful stranger and the pilgrim. Common sense will teach us
   the necessity of leaving this world, but faith can only assure us of
   another; they are believers and expectants of heaven.

   4. They do not only look for it, but seek after it. We read of both
   looking and seeking: Heb. xi. 14, They declare plainly that they seek a
   country:' Heb. xiii. 14, Here we have no continuing city, but we seek
   one to come.' Seeking implieth diligence in the use of means. All the
   life of a Christian is nothing but the seeking after another country,
   every day advancing a step nearer to heaven; and therefore their
   poli'teuma, their conversation' is said to be in heaven,' Phil. iii.
   20. This is their great business upon earth, to do all to eternal ends:
   all other works and labours are but upon the bye, and subordinate to
   this. Their main care is to obtain this blessed condition; therefore
   they use word and sacraments, that they may grow in grace, faith,
   repentance, new obedience. Every degree in grace is another step
   towards heaven: Ps. lxxxiv. 5, Blessed is the man whose strength is in
   thee, in whose hearts are the ways of them;' ver. 7, They go from
   strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.'
   Some of the saints are in patria, others in via, still bending
   homeward.

   5. Because they are so, the children of God are dealt with as
   strangers. Difference of scope and drift will procure alienation of
   affection: 1 Peter iv. 4, Wherein they think it strange that you run
   not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you;' and
   John xv. 19, If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but
   because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
   world, therefore the world hateth you.' Other cannot be expected but
   that the servants of the Lord should be ill rewarded and treated here,
   not only out of the world's ignorance--they know not our birth,
   breeding, expectations, hope: 1 John iii. 2, Beloved, now are we the
   sons of God; but it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know
   that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as
   he is'--but enmity, as the different carriage of the one puts a
   disgrace upon the course of life which the other doth affect; the one
   fixeth their home here, the other looketh for it elsewhere; and the
   world is sensible this is an excellency, and therefore those that are
   at the bottom of the hill, envy and malign those that are at the top.

   Use. Are we thus minded? There are two sorts of men in the world--the
   one is of the devil and the other is of God; for all men seek their
   rest and happiness on earth, or rest in heaven. Naturally men were all
   of the first number, for the rational soul without grace accommodateth
   itself to the interests of the body; but when sublimated and
   transformed by grace, the world cannot satisfy it, and it can find
   nothing there which may finally quiet its desires, for the new life
   infused hath other aims and tendencies. As saints are new-born from
   heaven, so for heaven; and therefore the new nature cannot satisfy
   itself in the enjoyment of the creature, with the absence of God. The
   apostle saith, While at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,'
   2 Cor. v. 6, 7. In this life we are not capable of the glorious
   presence of God; it is not consistent with our mortality; and our being
   present with him in the spirit is but a taste that doth provoke rather
   then cloy the appetite: Rom. viii. 23, Ourselves also, which have the
   first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.' These
   tastes do but make us long for more; they are sent down from heaven to
   draw us up to that place of our rest where this glory and blessedness
   is in fulness. Now which sort are ye of? the city of God, or under the
   dominion of Satan and the power of worldly lusts?

   1. There are some that take up here, and never consider whence they
   are, nor whither they are going; as Christ saith, I know whence I am,
   and whither I go.' They look altogether for the present, and if they be
   well for the present, they are contented. Alas! in what a miserable
   case are these men, though they mind it not! they seem to me to be like
   men that are going to execution. A man that is going to the gallows for
   the present is well, hath a great guard to attend him, an innumerable
   multitude of people to follow him: you would think that hardly could a
   man be such a sot and fool as to think all this should be done for his
   honour, and not for his punishment, and should only consider how he is
   accompanied, but not whither he goeth. Many such fools there are in the
   world, that only consider how they are attended and provided for, but
   never consider whither they are going. O wretch! whither goest thou?
   may we say to one that should pride himself in the resort of company to
   his execution. Dost thou not see thou art led to punishment, and after
   an hour or two these will leave thee hanging and perishing infamously
   as the just reward of thine offences? So many that shine now in the
   pomp and splendour of worldly accommodations, and are merry and jocund
   as if all would do well, alas! poor creatures, whither are they going?
   Job xxi. 12, 13, They take the timbrel and the harp, and rejoice at the
   sound of the organ; they spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go
   down into hell.' Ye still live, and are going to punishment, but mind
   it not; but your wealth, and honours, and servants, and friends will
   all leave you to your own doom; and yet you are merry and jocund as if
   your journey would never end, or not so dismally; as if you were
   hastening to a kingdom, and not to an eternal prison: one moment puts
   an end to all their joy for ever.

   2. There are others that wean their hearts from this world, and make it
   their care that they may carry themselves becoming their celestial
   extraction. As their souls were from above by creation, so all their
   hopes, and desires, and endeavours are to attain to that region of
   spirits; much more as being renewed by grace do they aim at the
   perfection and accomplishment of that life which is begun in them; and
   so being made partakers of the divine nature, do they escape the
   corruption that is in the world through lust,' 2 Peter i. 4, they are
   convinced of a better estate than the world yieldeth, and believe it,
   and look for it, and long for it, and labour for it. Now of which
   number are you? or, if you cannot decide that--because more goeth to
   the assuring of our interest than the world usually taketh to be
   necessary for that end and purpose--of which number do you mean to be?
   Will you be at home in the world, or seek the happiness of the world to
   come? that is, in other terms, do you mean to be pagans under a
   Christian name, or Christians indeed? You have but the name if you be
   not strangers and pilgrims here upon earth. All Christ's disciples
   indeed are called to sit loose from the world, and to have a high and
   deep sense of the world to come. As to the other world, they are no
   mere strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and
   of the household of God,' Eph. ii. 19. They are of a family, part of
   which is in heaven and part on earth: Eph. iii. 15, Of whom the whole
   family in heaven and earth is named.' Some of their brethren have got
   the start of them, and are with God before them, but the rest are
   hastening after as fast as they can. They are sufficiently convinced
   that the earth is no place for them; they are strangers there, and the
   contentments thereof uncertain and perishing; but they are no strangers
   to heaven and the blessed society of the saints, whose privileges they
   have a full right to now, and hope one day to have as full a
   possession, and an intimate communion with their Father and all their
   brethren.

   Now, that you may resolve upon this, and carry yourselves suitably, I
   shall--

   1. Give you some motives.

   2. A direction or two.

   1. Motives.

   [1.] He that taketh up his rest in this world, or any earthly thing, is
   but a higher kind of beast, and unworthy of an immortal soul. The
   beasts have an instinct that guideth them to seek things convenient for
   that life which they have, and therefore a man doth not follow the
   light of reason that seeketh to quiet his mind with what things the
   world affordeth, and only relisheth the contentments of the carnal and
   bodily life, that is satisfied with his portion here, Ps. xvii. 14. All
   their business and bustle is to have their wills and pleasure for a
   little while, as if they had neither hopes nor fears of any greater
   things hereafter: Ps. xlix. 20, Man, that is in honour, and void of
   understanding, is as the beast that perisheth,' because he merely
   inclineth to present satisfactions; for reason is as a middle thing
   between the life of faith and the life of sense. It were no great
   matter whether you were men or dogs or swine, if reason be only given
   you for the present world and present satisfactions; all your sense of
   the world to come and conscience is as good as nothing.

   [2.] None are of so noble and divine a spirit as those that seek the
   heavenly kingdom. Amongst men, the ambitious who aspire to crowns and
   kingdoms, that aim at perpetual fame by their virtues and rare
   exploits, are judged persons of greater gallantry than covetous
   muck-worms and brutish epicures; yet their highest thoughts and designs
   are very base in comparison of Christians, who by patient continuance
   in well-doing seek for life, glory, and immortality,' Rom. ii. 7, and
   whom nothing less will content than the enjoyment of God himself. Their
   desires are after him: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but thee?
   and who is there on earth I desire besides thee?' So that as man, being
   immortal, should provide for some place of perpetual abode, so herein
   the Christian excelleth other men, that nothing less will satisfy him
   than what God hath promised his people hereafter. The threshold will
   not content him--nothing but the throne.

   [3.] What a sorry immortality, mock eternity, do they choose, instead
   of the true one, when they neglect the pursuit of this heavenly
   country! If they look no higher than this world, all that they can
   rationally imagine is perpetuating themselves, and their names, and
   posterity, by successive generations: Ps. xlix. 11, Their inward
   thought is that their houses shall continue for ever, and their
   dwelling-places to all generations; they call their lands by their own
   names.' This is styled nodosa eternitas, when they live in their
   children after death. But alas! to how few men's share can this fall!
   and those who may in likelihood expect it, who are lords of fair rents,
   fair lands, houses and heritages, how often are they disappointed! But
   if their hopes should succeed, and they should make themselves this way
   eternal, yet when the pageantry of this world is over, the great
   ungodly men of the world, who have names, lands, families in the
   general resurrection shall be poor, base, contemptible; whereas he that
   made it his business to look after the world to come shall be glorious
   for ever.

   [4.] When once our qualification is clear, every step of our remove out
   of this world is an approach to our abiding city: Rom. xiii. 11, Our
   salvation nearer than when we first believed;' and 2 Cor. iv. 16,
   Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
   day.'

   [5.] Every degree of grace makes your qualification clearer: Col. i.
   12, Giving thanks to the father, who hath made us meet to be partakers
   of the inheritance of the saints in light;' and 1 Tim. vi. 19, Laying
   up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,
   that they may lay hold of eternal life.' Evidences are in creased when
   ripening for heaven more and more.

   2. Let us carry ourselves as such as count our best estate in this
   world as the house of our pilgrimage.

   [1.] Let us with great joy and delight of heart entertain the promises
   of the life to come, resolving to hold and hug them, and esteem them,
   and make much of them till the performance come: Heb. xi. 13, These all
   died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
   afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed
   that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.'

   [2.] Let us take heed of what may divert us and besot us, and hinder us
   in our heavenly journey: 1 Peter ii. 11, Dearly beloved, I beseech you,
   as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war
   against the soul.' A relish of the pleasures that offer themselves in
   the course of our pilgrimage spoileth the sense that we have of the
   world to come, and weakens our care and pursuit of it.

   [3.] Let us be contented with those provisions that God in his
   providence affordeth us by the way, though they be mean and scanty: 1
   Tim. vi. 8, Having food and raiment, let us be content, for we brought
   nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.' We
   came into the world contented with a cradle, and must go out contented
   with a grave; therefore, if we want the pomp of the world, let it not
   trouble us: we have such allowance as our heavenly Father seeth
   necessary for us till our great inheritance cometh in hand.

   [4.] If the world increase upon us, we should take the more care that
   we may have the comfort of it in the world to come: Rev. xiv. 13, Their
   works follow them:' Luke xvi. 9, Make to yourselves friends of the
   mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail they may receive you into
   everlasting habitations.' There is no other way to show our weanedness
   in a full estate, nor to keep our hearts clean, or to express our deep
   sense of the world to come, but this.

   Doct. 2. That during this estate, and the inconveniences thereof, God's
   children find matter of rejoicing in his word.

   1. Let us consider how this point lieth in this text.

   [1.] The Psalmist had a sufficient sense of the inconveniences of the
   house of his pilgrimage, his absence from God, for therefore he counts
   it a pilgrimage; the many affronts and dishonours that are done to God
   in the world, which go near to a gracious heart who espouseth God's
   quarrel and interest; therefore he saith, Horror hath taken hold upon
   me, because men keep not thy law.' Nay, and possibly his own
   afflictions and troubles, for many interpreters suppose him now
   expelled from Jerusalem, and driven to wander up and down in the
   forests and wildernesses; yet then could he comfort himself in God, and
   pass over his time in meditating on his precepts and promises. The
   troubles and inconveniences of our pilgrimage are easily disregarded by
   them that have no sense of them, or are slight-hearted, or whose time
   of trial is not yet come; but then is strength of grace seen when we
   can overcome sense of trouble by the encouragements which the bare
   naked word of God offereth. If David were now in exile, it was a
   trouble to him not to enjoy the ordinances and means of grace with the
   rest of God's people; but to deceive the tediousness of it by God's
   word, that is the trial. If we can depend upon the promise, when
   nothing but the promise is left us, there are no difficulties too great
   for the comfort of God's word to allay.

   [2.] The Psalmist speaketh not of what he would do, but what he had
   done: Thy statutes have been my songs.' Experience of the comfort of
   the word is more than a resolution to seek it there. In his resolution
   he would have been a pattern of duty, but now he is a precedent of
   comfort. That which hath been may be; God, that hath given u promise
   and comfort to his saints before, will continue it in all ages.

   [3.] The Psalmist speaketh not of an ordinary joy, but such as was
   ready to break out into singing, which noteth the heart is full, and
   can hold no longer without some vent and utterance; as Paul and Silas
   were so full of joy that they sang at midnight in the stocks.

   2. Now I come to the reasons why God's pilgrims find matter of
   rejoicing in his word during the time of their exile and absence from
   God, and all the inconveniences that attend it.

   [1.] Some on the word's part.

   [2.] Some on the part of him that rejoiceth.

   [1.] On the word's part, God's pilgrims can rejoice in it.

   (1.) There they have the discovery and promise of eternal life. It
   telleth them of their country. A firm deed and conveyance is a comfort
   to us before we have possession: 2 Peter i. 4, To us are given
   exceeding great and precious promises, that being made partakers of the
   divine nature, we may escape the corruptions that are in the world
   through lust.' In the word there are promises neither of small things,
   of things of a little moment, nor of things that we have nothing to do
   with, but of great moment and weight, and given to us. The promises
   make the things promised certain to those to whom they do belong,
   though they be not yet actually in their possession; and therefore the
   children of God are delighted in them, and so far as that their hearts
   are drawn off from worldly things. They that adhere to them, and prize
   the comfort which they offer, have something in them above natural men,
   or the ordinary sort of those that live in the world.

   (2.) There they have sure direction how they may attain this
   blessedness which the promises speak of, and that is a great comfort in
   the midst of the darkness and uncertainty of the present life. The word
   of God is said to be a light that shineth to us in a dark place,' 2
   Peter i. 19. The love of the world will mislead us, our own reason will
   often leave us comfortless, the examples of the best are defective, but
   the word of God will give comfortable direction to all that follow the
   direction of it, under all their crosses, confusions and difficulties:
   Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a light unto my feet, and a lantern to my
   paths.' Light is comfortable; it is no small satisfaction that I am in
   God's way, and have his word for my warrant.

   (3.) It propoundeth the examples of their countrymen, and sets forth
   their heroical acts, and encourageth us to imitate their fortitude and
   self-denial: Heb. vi. 12, Be followers of them who through faith and
   patience inherit the promises:' many things are to be done and suffered
   before we attain the end. Now, it is a great comfort to trace the
   footsteps of the saints all along in the way in which we go: Heb. xii.
   1, Wherefore, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of
   witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
   easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
   before us.' If God did call us to walk in an untrodden path, it might
   be cumbersome and solitary. Now it is very obliging and encouraging to
   consider in what way they have been brought to heaven before us.

   (4.) It hath many seasonable cordials against fainting by the way.
   Alas! when we are in deep pressures, our hearts are apt to sink; but
   the word assureth us that we shall have all things necessary for us,.
   that our heavenly Father seeth what is best for us, and that if we
   faithfully wait upon him, our afflictions and rubs in the way shall be
   a means to bring us to our journey's end: 2 Cor. iv. 17, Our light
   affliction, that is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory:' and that for the present our
   trials are not inconsistent with his love.

   [2.] On the believer's part there are reasons of this comfort and
   rejoicing.

   (1.) There needeth a spiritual frame of heart, for a carnal man's
   rejoicings and relishes are suitable to the constitution of his mind:
   Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
   flesh, and they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit.'
   It is an infallible rule to the world's end. Every one cannot say, Thy
   statutes are my songs.' No; they must have other solaces; and a man's
   temper is more discerned by his solaces than by anything else. They
   that have not purged their taste from the dregs of sense, the trash of
   the flesh-pots of Egypt will ever be pleasing to them in the heavenly
   pilgrimage; and being inveigled with the baits of the flesh, the
   promises are like withered flowers to them, or as dry chips; it is the
   spiritual heart that is refreshed with spiritual songs.

   (2.) This word must be received by faith, for it is faith that
   enliveneth our notions of things, and maketh them work with us: Heb.
   xi. 13, These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
   having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
   them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims upon the
   earth.' Our affections follow persuasion: 1 Peter i. 8, Whom having not
   seen we love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye
   rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:' Rom. xv. 13, Now the
   God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.'

   (3.) This word must be improved by reading and hearing, but especially
   by meditation and singing.

   (1st.) Meditation, when it is sweet and lively, stirreth this joy.
   Delight begets meditation, and meditation begets delight. There is a
   kukloge'nesis in moral as well as natural things: Ps. i. 2, His delight
   is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and
   night:' and Ps. cxix. 97, Oh, how love I thy law! it is my meditation
   day and night:' and ver. 15, 16, I will meditate in thy precepts, and
   have respect unto thy ways: I will delight myself in thy statutes; I
   will not forget thy words.' These follow one another. Affections are
   not excited but by deep and pondering thoughts.

   (2d.) By singing psalms we draw forth this delight: Col. iii. 16, Let
   the word of God dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and
   admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
   singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord;' Eph. v. 18, 19, Be not
   drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit,
   speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.' Drunkards, when
   tilled with the spirit of wine, sing wanton songs; and those who are
   filled with the wine of the Spirit will praise God with spiritual
   songs. This is a duty of importance, a delightful way of being
   instructed by our refreshment. God would give us strength, but this is
   neglected, or cursorily performed by Christians. We will complain of
   the want of a spirit in prayer; we should do so in singing. Coldness in
   this holy exercise argueth a deadness of faith and a coldness in true
   religion. We should express our joy this way.

   (4.) Above all, this comfort is found in ready practice and obedience.
   There is a comfort, I confess, in speculation, but not so deep and
   intimate as in practice. The one is out a taste inviting to the other,
   which giveth us a fuller draught. The bare contemplation and view of
   any concerning and weighty truth is very ravishing to those that bend
   their minds to knowledge: Prov. xxiv. 13, 14, My son, eat thou honey,
   because it is good, and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste; so
   shall the knowledge of wisdom be to thy soul.' Every truth is objectum
   intellectus, much more divine truth; but now in practice the impression
   is doubled: we get comfort and joy raised in our consciences; our lives
   and light do not jar; we are at full quiet in our minds, apprehending
   ourselves to be in God's way: Ps. cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way
   of thy testimonies as much as in all riches.'

   Use 1. To show you that the people of God need not envy the wicked for
   their delights and pleasures; they have chaster and sweeter delights;
   God's statutes are their songs. Where the heart is spiritual, they can
   find delight enough in the word, both as their charter and their rule,
   and need not turn aside to vain mirth; a portion in the promises will
   yield pleasure enough: ver. 111, Thy testimonies have I taken as an
   heritage for ever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart.'

   2. To reprove those that reckon these things a burthen. The holy
   talking of heaven and godliness maketh worldly men ever heavy and out
   of humour; it is not their delight. But it should not be so with the
   children of God. A child of God should only be heavy when he displeases
   God, but delight in all the means that enable him to live to God.

   3. When we are saddened by the evil of the present world, let us make
   use of this remedy; let us meditate on God's statutes. We shall find
   ease and refreshing by exercising ourselves to know God in Christ.

   4. To refute the vain conceit which possesseth the minds of men, that
   the way of godliness is a gloomy way. As soon as a man beginneth to
   think of salvation, or the change of his life, or the leaving of his
   sins, embracing the service of God, presently his mind is haunted with
   this thought: Seest thou not how those that serve God are melancholy,
   afflicted; sorrowful, never rejoice more? and wilt thou be one of them?
   This is the opinion of the world, that they can never rejoice nor be
   merry that serve God. But certainly it is a vain conceit. No men do
   more and more truly rejoice than they which serve God. Consult the
   scriptures, who have more leave, shall I say, or command, to rejoice?
   Ps. xxxvii. 4, Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee
   the desires of thine heart:' Phil. iv. 4, Rejoice in the Lord always,
   and again I say, Rejoice.' Ask reason who have more cause or matter to
   rejoice than they that have provided against the fears or doubts of
   conscience by reason of sin? What is more satisfactory to a soul in
   doubts and fears than the knowledge of pardon and reconciliation with
   God? For the satisfaction of the desires of nature which carry us after
   happiness, who have a more powerful exciter of joy than the Holy Ghost?
   Acts xiii. 52, The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy
   Ghost.' Who more qualified with joy than those who have a clear right
   to the pardon of sin, and so can see all miseries unstinged? Rom. v.
   1-3, Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom also we have access by faith
   into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of
   God; and not only so, but we glory in tribulation also.' How joyful are
   those that see themselves prepared for everlasting life! 2 Cor. v. 1,
   For we know that if our earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have a
   building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.'
   Yea, when a Christian knoweth his duty, his way is plain before him; it
   is a mighty satisfaction: Ps. xix. 8, The statutes of the Lord are
   right, rejoicing the heart.' Look into the lives and examples of the
   saints; who have more true joy than they? The disciples esteem the
   grace of the gospel such a great treasure, that though they suffer
   persecution for it they are filled with joy: Acts viii. 8, And there
   was great joy in that city,' Thes. i. 6, Having received the word with
   much affliction and joy in the Holy Ghost:' 2 Cor. vii. 4, I am
   exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.' Preachers, though with great
   hazard they perform their office, should be joyful: Acts xx. 24,
   Neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my
   course with joy;' Phil. ii. 17, 18, Yea, and if I be offered for the
   sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all;
   for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me.' The world will
   reply--I know not what this spiritual consolation meaneth; it seemeth
   hard to relinquish that which I see, that which I feel, that which I
   taste, for that which I see not, and it may be shall never see.

   Ans. 1. By concession, the joy of the saints is the joy of faith. God
   is unseen, Christ is within the heavens, great hopes are to come: 1
   Peter i. 8, In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye
   rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;' 2 Cor. v. 7, For we
   walk by faith, not by sight.'

   2. Thus you see that the world cannot alway rejoice in those things
   which they take to be the proper objects of joy: they have alternative
   vicissitudes, now rejoice, now mourn; nor can it be otherwise, for they
   rejoice in things which cannot always last. If they rejoice when their
   worldly comforts increase, they are sad when they wither; if they
   rejoice when their children are born, they weep when they die: but a
   Christian hath always his songs, for he must always rejoice in the
   Lord, who is an eternal God: Phil. iv. 4, Rejoice in the Lord always;'
   in Christ, who hath obtained eternal redemption for us,' Heb. ix. 12;
   in the promises, which give an eternal influence: Ps. cxix. 111, Thy
   testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart.' The flesh cannot afford anything so delightful
   as a Christian hath; the word will hold good for ever.

   3. We cannot altogether say that a Christian doth rejoice in that which
   he cannot see; for all that they see is their everlasting Father's
   wealth: 1 Cor. iii. 21, All are yours, for you are Christ's, and Christ
   is God's.' If they look to heaven, they can rejoice and say, Glory be
   to thee, O Lord, who hast prepared this for our everlasting
   dwelling-place. If they look to the earth, Glory be to thee, Lord, who
   dost not leave us destitute in the house of our pilgrimage. If they
   consider their afflictions, they rejoice that God is not unmindful of
   poor creatures, who are beneath his anger as well as unworthy of his
   love: Job vii. 17, 18, What is man that thou shouldst magnify him, and
   that thou shouldst set thine heart upon him, and that thou shouldst
   visit him every morning, and try him every moment?' that God should
   trouble himself about us, that we may not perish with the ungodly
   world. The same love that sendeth them prosperity sendeth adversity
   also, which they find by the seasonableness of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXI.

   I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy
   law.--Ver. 55.

   WE often read and sing David's psalms, but we have little of David's
   spirit. A man's employment is as the constitution of his mind is, for
   all things work according to their nature. A man addicted to God, that
   is to say, one who hath taken God for his happiness, his word for his
   rule, his Spirit for his guide, and his promises for his encouragement,
   his heart will always be working towards God day and night. In the day
   he will be studying God's word; in the night, if his sleep be
   interrupted, he will be meditating on God's name; still entertaining
   his soul with God. The predominant affection will certainly set the
   thoughts awork. The man of God had told us in the former verse what was
   his chief employment in the day-time, and now he telleth us how his
   heart wrought in the night. Night and day he was remembering God and
   his duty to him. In the day the statutes of God were his solace, and as
   songs to him in the house of his pilgrimage; in the night the name of
   God was his meditation: I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the
   night, and have kept thy law.' In which words observe--

   1. David's exercise, I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night.

   2. The effect and fruit of it, and have kept thy law.

   The one may be considered as the means, the other as the next and
   immediate end. Remembering and thinking is but a subservient help and
   means to promote some higher work.

   1. In the first branch you have--

   [1.] The act of his soul, I have remembered.

   [2.] The object about which it was conversant, thy name, O Lord.

   [3.] The season, in the night.

   For the act of his soul, I have remembered.' Remembrance is an act of
   knowledge reiterated, or a second agitation of the mind unto that point
   unto which it had arrived before. Or, more plainly, remembering is a
   setting knowledge awork, or a reviving those notions which we have of
   things, and exercising our thoughts and meditations about them.

   [2.] The object was God's name;' that is, either God himself, as Ps.
   xx. 1, The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;' or that by which God
   is known, his wisdom, goodness, and power, especially those notions by
   which he hath manifested himself in the word.

   [3.] The season, In the night.' Some take the night metaphorically for
   the time of trouble and affliction. It is often a dark time with the
   people of God, a very dark night, and then it is comfortable to them to
   think of his name, according to that of the prophet, Isa. l. 10, He
   that walketh in darkness and hath no light, let him stay him self upon
   the name of his God.' I think it is meant literally; that the man of
   God took such pleasure in the name of God, that what time others gave
   to sleep and rest he would give to the contemplation of his glory. In
   the solitude and darkness of the night he sustained and supported his
   spirit with the thoughts of God, and thereby took up a courage and
   constancy of resolution to keep his law.

   2. The other branch, I have kept thy law;' that is, with a good and
   sincere heart set himself to the keeping of it; this is spoken partly
   to intimate his own seriousness in this work, and partly God's blessing
   upon his endeavours therein.

   [1.] His seriousness and sincerity in the work. There is a twofold
   remembrance of things:--

   (1.) Notional and speculative.

   (2.) Practical and affective.

   The notional and speculative remembrance of things is when we barely
   think of them, without any further profit or benefit; but the
   practical, powerful and affective remembrance is to be affected with
   matters called to mind as the nature of them doth require: as when we
   remember God so as to love him, and fear him, and trust in him, and
   make him our delight, and cleave to him, and obey him. And we are said
   to remember his commandments, when our hearts are set upon the practice
   of them. Verba notitiae connotant affectus: we must not think of God
   indifferently, and by the by, but we must be answerably affected, and
   act accordingly. Thus did David, I remembered thy name, and kept thy
   law.'

   [2.] God's blessing upon his endeavours; for he presently addeth in the
   next verse, This I had, because I kept thy precepts.' Our heavenly
   Father, who seeth what is done in secret, will reward it openly,' Mat.
   vi. 6. And the blessing of time well-spent in secret, or a few serious
   thoughts of God in the night, will publicly appear in their carriage
   before men. If we be frequently and seriously with God when we are
   solitary, the fruit and benefit of it will be manifest by our holiness
   and heavenliness when we are in company. Your most private duties do
   not lose their reward. As a man's pains in study will appear in the
   accurate order, strength, and rationality of his discourse, so his
   converse with God in private will be seen in the fruits of it, in his
   holy, profitable and serious conversation.

   The points are three:--

   Doct. 1. Remembering God is an especial help to the keeping of his law.

   Doct. 2. God is best remembered when his name is studied.

   Doct. 3. Those that have spiritual affections will take all occasions
   to remember his name. I have remembered thy name in the night season,'
   saith holy David.

   Doct. 1. That remembering God is an especial help to the keeping of his
   law.

   First, What it is to remember God.

   1. It supposeth some knowledge of God, for what a man knoweth not he
   cannot remember. The memory is the cofferer and treasurer of the soul;
   what the understanding taketh in, the memory layeth up; and actually we
   are said to remember when we set the mind awork upon such notions as we
   have formerly received. And particularly to remember God is when we
   stir up in our minds clear and heart-warming apprehensions about his
   nature and will.

   2. It supposeth some faith, that we believe him to be such as the word
   describeth him to be; for spiritual remembrance is the actuation of
   faith, or, in this case, the improvement of that wisdom, power,
   goodness, holiness, justice, and truth, which we believe to be in God.
   Otherwise, without faith, those thoughts which we have of the greatest
   matters affect us no more than a dream doth a sleeper.

   These things are supposed in remembrance.

   3. It expresseth a reviving of these thoughts, or an erection of the
   mind to think upon what we know and believe. Man, that hath an
   ingestive, hath also an egestive faculty, and can lay out as well as
   lay up, bring forth truths out of the mind when it is useful for us,
   and whet and inculcate them upon the heart; he may call to mind or
   ponder upon them.

   4. Let us see the kinds of this remembrance.

   [1.] I must repeat that distinction; it may be done notionally and
   speculatively, or else affectively and practically. Notionally, when
   men have a few barren notions, or dry sapless opinions or speculations
   about the nature of God; always men's remembrance is as their knowledge
   is, and faith is. Now there is mo'rphosis tes gno'seos, a form of
   knowledge, Rom. ii. 10, and dead faith,' James ii. 20. Affectively and
   practically we remember God when there are such lively and powerful
   impressions of his name upon our hearts as produce reverence, love, and
   obedience. It is not enough to grant the doctrine, own the opinions
   that are sound and orthodox concerning God, but we must have a
   reverential and superlative, esteem of him. All men confess a God with
   their mouth, and think they believe in him; but the fool hath said in
   his heart, There is no God,' Ps. xiv. 1. What testimony do their hearts
   and actions give? A man's course of life and conversation is like an
   eye-witness; his profession is as a testimony by report. Now one
   eye-witness deserves more credit than many by hearsay. Plus valet unus
   oculatus testis, &c. How would you walk if you believed there were no
   God? Could you be more neglectful of God, and careless and mindless of
   heavenly things, than you are? Now your transgressions speak louder
   than your professions in the eye of an understanding believer: Ps.
   xxxvi. 1, The transgression of the wicked saith within his heart that
   there is no fear of God before his eyes.' Practice belies profession:
   Titus i. 16, They profess that they know God, but in works they deny
   him.' Cold and dead opinions are easily taken up, and men talk by rote
   one after another, yea, and study to defend them, and yet count God an
   idol. Denial in works is the strongest way of denial, for actions are
   more weighty and deliberate than speeches.

   [2.] There is a threefold remembrance of God for practical uses.

   (1.) There is a constant remembrance. We should carry the thoughts of
   God along with us to all our businesses and affairs, and ever wall; as
   in his eye and presence: Prov. xxiii. 17, Be thou in the fear of the
   Lord all the day long;' not only in prayer, but at all times, in all
   our other occasions. Some graces, like the lungs, are always in use; so
   Ps. xvi. 8, I have set the Lord always before me.' He that liveth
   always in the sight of God cannot be so secure and senseless as others
   are. A drowsy inattentive mind is easily deceived into sin, but he that
   doth often remember God, his conscience is kept waking; for he is all
   eye, and seeth all things; all hand, and toucheth all things; all foot,
   and walketh everywhere; all ear, and heareth all things. Sic agamus cum
   hominibus tanquam Deus videat; sic loquamur cum Deo tanquam homines
   audiant. The latter clause was the least that a heathen could think of;
   but surely, if there be any weight in the former part of the direction,
   the latter is needless. Thus we should never forget God.

   (2.) Occasional, when God is brought to mind either by some special
   occasion offered, or by some notable discovery of himself in his word
   or works. Occasion offered; as when Ahasuerus could not sleep, Esther
   vi. 1, it was the providence of God he should read in the chronicles,
   and so come to the knowledge of Mordecai. So it befalleth God's
   children; they cannot sleep sometimes, and so occasion is offered in
   the silence and solitude of the night to invite them to holy thoughts
   of God, which may be of great use and comfort: Job xxxvii. 7, He
   sealeth up the hand of every man, that all men may know his work.' In
   deep snow or rain their work is hindered, that they, sitting at home,
   may have time to consider of God and his providence. Sometimes it
   falleth out so that we know not what to do with our thoughts, and it
   will look strangely in the review if we should prostitute them to
   vanity rather than give them to God, like the act of a spiteful man,
   that will rather destroy and waste a commodity than let another have
   it. Or when some notable discovery of God is in his ordinances and
   providences, word, or works; we should always season our hearts with
   the thoughts of God, we should see him in every creature, and observe
   him in his daily providences. The name of God is upon all things that
   he hath made, but especially any notable providence that falleth out,
   which is an especial demonstration of his wisdom, justice, and power:
   Ps. cxi. 4, He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered.' So in
   his ordinances, when God maketh any nearer approach to us by way of
   conviction, counsel, or comfort: 1 Cor. xiv. 25, And thus are the
   secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he
   will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.' Many times
   our minds in reading or hearing are illustrated with a heavenly light,
   or our hearts touched with some delightful relish, and the word cometh
   in with more than ordinary authority and power upon the heart; these
   are especial occasions which we must take to consider God and the great
   affairs of our souls.

   (3.) Set and solemn, when from the bent, purpose, and inclination of
   our own hearts, without any outward impulsion, we set ourselves to
   remember the God that made us. From first to last there is great use of
   meditation and serious thoughts of God in the spiritual life. Our first
   awaking is occasioned by them: Ps. xxii. 27, They shall remember and
   turn to the Lord.' For a great while we live without God in the world,
   till we recollect ourselves, and consider where we are and whither we
   are going. We are like men drunk or asleep, and do not make use of our
   reason and common principles that may be learned from the inspection of
   the creature and everything about us; and when once we are brought into
   the communion of the life of God, and have grace planted in our hearts,
   it cannot be carried on unless we take time to remember God. Our faith,
   our love, our desires, our delight, they are all acted and exercised by
   our thoughts; so that the spiritual life is but an imagination, unless
   we do frequently and often take time for serious meditation of him. It
   is not consistent with any of the three vital graces, faith, hope, and
   love, that a man should be a stranger to the remembrance of God;
   therefore God complaineth of it as a strange thing: Jer. ii. 32, My
   people have forgotten me days without number;' do no more regard me
   than if they had never known me, Besides, the habits of grace are so
   weak, and our temptations so strong, and the difficulties of obedience
   so great, that I cannot see how we can keep afoot any interest of God
   in ourselves, if we seldom think of God, and do not sometimes sequester
   ourselves to revive this memorial upon our souls. Can a sluggish heart
   be quickened, or weak and inconstant resolutions be strengthened, or
   the sparks of love ever blown up into a flame, and fainting hopes
   cherished, unless we seriously set our minds awork to consider of God
   and our obligations to him? Will a sleepy profession, without constant
   and lively thoughts do it? It cannot be. Oh, no! If you mean to keep in
   the fire, you must ply the bellows and blow hard. Whet truths upon the
   understanding, and agitate your minds in this holy work.

   Secondly, My next work is to show that this is a notable help to
   godliness; and that appeareth enough in that forgetting God is assigned
   as the cause of all mischief, and remembering God the engagement to all
   duty. We forget God, do not meditate upon his name, and so fall into
   sin: Ps. ix. 17, The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the
   nations that forget God.' Some deny God, but most forget him; they cast
   away the knowledge of God out of their minds. So Ps. l. 22, Consider
   this, all ye that forget God;' that is the description of the wicked.
   So it is the charge upon Israel, as their great sin and cause of their
   defection: Deut. xxxii. 18, Thou art unmindful of the rock that begat
   thee; thou hast forgotten the God that formed thee.' Oblivion is an
   ignorance for the time. Truths lose their efficacy when not remembered.
   On the other side, remembering God is made to be the immediate and next
   cause of our duty: Eccles. xii. 1, Remember now thy Creator in the days
   of thy youth.' Youth would not miscarry so shamefully if they did
   oftener remember God, nor be led away by vain and sensual delights, if
   the thoughts of God did more dwell in their minds. So Deut. viii. 11,
   12, Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his
   commandments.' Our lives will declare whether we do remember God. Those
   that do often and seriously keep God in their thoughts, will be most
   careful to keep his commandments.

   Thirdly, The reasons of the point.

   1. It doth encourage us, and quicken us to diligence in our work. As
   soldiers fight best in their general's presence, and scholars ply their
   books when under their master's eye, so by living always in the sight
   of God we study to please him. The oftener we consider him the more we
   see no service can be holy and good enough for such a God as he is; a
   God not to be provoked and resisted, so not to be neglected and
   slighted: Mal. i. 14, Cursed be the deceiver that hath in his flock a
   male, and voweth and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am
   a great king, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among
   the heathen:' implying that when they came with a sickly sacrifice,
   they did not remember his excellency and greatness. Either they had no
   or mean thoughts of God; but if they had remembered what an one he is,
   they would employ the best of their strength, time, and affection in
   his service.

   2. The madness of our natures is bridled and restrained by thoughts of
   God: 3 John 11, He that doth evil hath not seen God.' Will he force the
   queen before my face?' Esther vii. 8. You will not sport with sin, nor
   play with the occasions of it, nor dare to venture upon God's
   restraints. It is said of an archangel, ouk eto'lmese, he durst not
   bring against him a railing accusation,' Jude 9, because they be held
   the face of God. So if we had a deep sense of God impressed upon our
   hearts, we would be more awe-ful. You make very bold with God when you
   dare knowingly venture upon the least sin. Will you affront God to his
   face? Children that are quarrelling or falling out, when the father or
   mother cometh, all is hush and silent.

   3. It comforts and reviveth us in the midst of our faintings and
   discouragements, because of the evils of the present world: Jonah ii.
   7, When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord.' When the
   burden of affliction presseth us sore, the stoutest hearts are broken
   and lose all courage; but when we come to ponder seriously what God is,
   or what he will be to his people, or hath at any time been to
   ourselves, it cheereth and reviveth the heart. So Ps. xlii. 6, O my
   God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore will I remember thee.'
   By this way the saints recover themselves, Ps. lxxvii. 10, And I said,
   This is my infirmity; but I will remember the years of the right hand
   of the Most High.' So also, Mat. xvi. 9, Do ye not remember the five
   loaves of the five thousand, nor the seven loaves of the four
   thousand?'

   Use. To press us to remember God more. When we will not look upon
   another, we take it to be a great sign of aversation and hatred. The
   devils, that are most opposite to God, abhor their own thoughts of God,
   for they believe and tremble.' God thinketh of us; he is not far from
   every one of us; why are we so far from him? We cannot open our eyes
   but one object or other will represent God to us. What dost thou see,
   hear, and feel, but the effects of his power and goodness? He is before
   thee, behind thee, within thee, round about thee; and shall he not find
   room in thy heart, when every trifle findeth room there? He that
   filleth every place, shall thy heart be empty of all thoughts of him?
   To press you to this--

   1. Consider we are naturally apt to forget God, do not like to retain
   him in our knowledge, Rom. i. 28, backward to any remembrance of him:
   Ps. x. 4, The wicked, through the pride of their countenance, will not
   seek after God; God is not in all their thoughts.'

   2. How much God hath done to put us in remembrance of him, by
   creatures, providences, ordinances, and his Spirit.

   [1.] Creatures, all of them, sun, moon, stars, worms, grass, put us in
   mind of him: Ps. xix. 1, 2, The heavens declare the glory of God, and
   the firmament showeth his handiwork; day unto day uttereth speech, and
   night unto night showeth knowledge.' The creatures have a double
   use--their natural use and their spiritual use. Their natural use is
   the special end for which they were made; their spiritual use is to set
   forth God to us. We look upon them amiss if we look upon them as
   separated from and independent of God. Our food is not only to nourish
   nature, but that we may taste the sweetness and goodness of God in it.
   All the creatures bring this message to our consciences: Remember God
   that made us and all things else. They all read a divinity lecture to
   those that have a mind to hear it, and preach the goodness, power, and
   wisdom of God by a loud and audible voice. It is true we are deaf, but
   they cease not to cry to us: Job xii. 8, Speak to the earth, and it
   shall teach thee; and to the beasts of the field, and they shall
   declare to thee. Not only the shining heavens, but the dull earth, that
   heaviest and grossest element; the brute creatures that have no reason,
   the mute fishes that can make no sound, we must ask them, parley with
   them by our own thoughts; and so, though they have neither voice nor
   ears, they will answer us, and resolve our consciences the question we
   put to them, Is there a God? Yea, and declare his excellent attributes,
   that he is eternal, infinite, wise, powerful, and good. We may easily
   make out these collections. Christ saith the stones would cry if these
   held their peace. We should hear the creature as we would hear God
   himself speaking to us. They speak to all countries in their own
   language. At first God spake to the world not by words but things. Thus
   hath God engraven his name upon his works, as those that make watches,
   or any curious pieces, write their names upon them; as he that carved a
   buckler for Minerva had so curiously inlaid his own name that it could
   not be rased out without defacing the whole work. So the creatures are
   but a draught and portraiture of God's glory.

   [2.] Providences, these do more awaken us. God's daily benefits should
   bring him to our remembrance: Acts xiv. 17, Nevertheless he left not
   himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from
   heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
   gladness;' Deut. viii. 18, But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,
   for he it is that giveth thee power to get wealth.' Especially the
   sanctified remembrance of God's dealing with his people is the way to
   keep the heart in the faith, love, and fear of God; and the forgetting
   his works is the cause of all defection and falling off to carnal
   courses and confidences: Ps. lxxviii. 11, They forgat his works and
   wonders that he showed them,' Ps. cvi. 21, They forgat God their
   Saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;' Judges viii. 34, And
   the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, who had
   delivered them out of the hands of their enemies on every side.' It is
   a base ingratitude not to remember, prize, and esteem God for all this.

   [3.] Ordinances. Ministry was instituted to put you in remembrance, and
   give you still new and fresh occasions to think of God: 2 Peter i. 12,
   I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance.' Our business
   is not always to inform you of what you know not, but to inculcate and
   revive known truths, there being much forgetfulness, stupidness, and
   senselessness upon our spirits: 2 Peter iii. 1, That I may stir up your
   minds by way of remembrance.' The impressions of God on our minds are
   soon defaced; we need to quicken and awaken your affections and
   resolutions to choose and cleave to God: 1 Tim. iv. 6, If thou put the
   brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister
   of Jesus Christ.' So sacraments are instituted to bring God to
   remembrance: 1 Cor. xi. 24, This do in remembrance of me:' that we may
   remember his love and our covenanted duty. The sabbath was instituted
   for a remembrance and memorial of his creating, redeeming goodness.

   [4.] The great office and work of the Spirit is to bring to
   remembrance: John xiv. 26, He shall bring all things to your
   remembrance.' We are apt to forget God, and instructions, and rebukes
   in their season: the Holy Ghost is our monitor.

   3. God will not forget them that remember him. He will remember them at
   every turn: Mal. iii. 16, Then they that feared the Lord spake often
   one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of
   remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and
   thought upon his name.' If he do not openly reward you with temporal
   deliverances, yet he taketh notice of every thought and every word you
   speak for him, and taketh pleasure in you. It is upon record; if you
   have not the comfort of it now, you shall have it in a little time.
   Because they thought of him they spake of him, and owned him in an evil
   time; and therefore God is represented as hearing and booking: and the
   books shall one day be opened, and then you shall have your public
   reward.

   Doct. 2. God is best remembered when his name is studied.

   First, When is his name studied? In the general, when we look upon him
   as he hath manifested himself in his word and works. More particularly,
   God is discovered sometimes by the name of his essence, sometimes by
   his attributes.

   1. By the name of his essence. When Moses was very inquisitive to know
   his name--and God can best tell his own name--let us see what answer
   was made him: Exod. iii. 12, 13, When they shall say unto me, What is
   his name? and God said, I am that I am.' God was sending Moses upon a
   strange message; he was giving him commission to go and speak to a king
   to dismiss and let go six hundred thousand of his subjects, to lead
   them to a place which God should show. Now Moses thought for such a
   message he had need have good authority, therefore desireth a
   significant name. I am that I am.' The form of the words showeth it was
   a wonderful incomprehensible name: Ask not my name, for it is
   Wonderful,' Judges xiii. 18. This is enough to satisfy sober inquiry,
   though not wanton curiosity, enough for faith to work upon: the great I
   AM hath sent me. It showeth his unsearchableness. It is our manner of
   speech when we would cover anything and not answer distinctly, we say.
   It is what it is; I have said what I have said. Finite understandings
   cannot comprehend him that is infinite, no more than you can empty the
   sea with a cockleshell. He is the great and only being, in comparison
   of whom all else is nothing: Isa. xl. 17, All nations before him are
   nothing, they are counted less than nothing and vanity.' You have not a
   true and full notion of God if you conceive him only as the most
   eminent of all beings: no being must appear as being in his sight and
   in comparison of him. As long as you only conceive God to be the best,
   you still attribute something to the creature, for all comparatives
   include the positive. The creature is nothing in comparison with God;
   all the glory, perfection, and excellency of the whole world do not
   amount to the value of a unit in regard of God's attributes: join never
   so many of them together, they cannot make up one number, they are
   nothing in his regard, and less than nothing. All created beings must
   utterly vanish out of sight when we think of God. As the sun doth not
   annihilate the stars, and make them nothing, yet it annihilates their
   appearance to our sight; some are of the first magnitude, some of the
   second, some of the third, but in the day-time all are alike, all are
   darkened by the sun's glory: so it is here; there are degrees of
   perfection and excellency if we compare one creature with another, but
   let once the glorious brightness of God shine upon the soul, and in
   that light all their differences are unobserved. Angels, men, worms,
   they are all nothing, less than nothing to be set up against God: this
   magnificent title, I am, darkeneth all, as if nothing else were. God
   did not tell Moses that he was the best, the highest, and the most
   glorious, but I am, and there is none else besides me:' nothing that
   hath its being of itself, nothing that can be properly called its own.
   Thus the incomprehensible self-existence of God puts man into his
   original nothing: none but God can say, I am, because all things else
   are but borrowed drops of this self-sufficient fountain; other things
   are near to nothing. God most properly is, who never was nothing, never
   shall be nothing, who may always in all difference of time say, I am,
   and nothing else but God can say so. The heaven and earth six thousand
   years ago could not say, We are. Adam could once have said, I am, as to
   his existence in the compounded nature of man, but now he cannot say
   it. All the gene rations past were but are not, and the present is but
   will not be; and within a little while who of us can say, I am? No; our
   place will know us no more:' but God eternally saith, I am:' not, I
   have been, or I shall be, but I am.' Look a little backward, and you
   shall find man's beginning; step a little forward, and you shall
   overtake his dissolution. But God is still I am; he is one that is
   before all, after all, and in all. He beholdeth from the mount of
   eternity all the successions and changes of the creature, and there is
   no succession or mutation in his knowledge. Well, then, here is an
   answer for Pharaoh, and the Israelites, and all of you to study on, I
   am that I am.' I am the fountain of all being, that do unchangeably and
   eternally exist in myself, and from myself.

   2. God hath described his name by his attributes. To go over all, the
   compass of a sermon will not permit. I shall single out three from all
   the rest--his power, wisdom, and goodness; they are manifested in all
   that God doth.

   [1.] In creation. Basil, Epoi'esen os agatho`s to` chre'simon, os
   sopho`s to` ka'lliston, os dunato`s to` me'giston--the goodness of God
   is seen in the usefulness of the creatures to man; the power of God in
   the stupendousness and wonderfulness of his works; his wisdom in the
   apt structure, constitution, and order of all things: first he
   createth, then distinguished, then adorneth. The first work was to
   create the heavens and earth out of nothing; there is his power: his
   next work is a wise destination and ordination of all things; he
   distinguisheth night from day, darkness from light, waters above the
   firmament from waters beneath the firmament, the sea from the dry land;
   there is his wisdom: then he decketh the earth with plants, and
   furnisheth it with beasts, and storeth the sea with fishes, the
   firmament with stars; there is his goodness. Let us examine these more
   particularly, beginning--

   (1.) With his goodness. The creation is nothing else but an effusion of
   the bounty and goodness of God. He made the world, not that he might be
   happy, but that he might be liberal; he made the world not by
   necessity, but at his pleasure: Rev. iv. 11, Thou hast created all
   things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.' God was happy
   enough without us; fee had a fulness and absolute sufficiency within
   himself; his great aim was to raise up objects out of nothing, to whom
   he would communicate his goodness. The heavens and earth were made that
   man might have a place for his exercise, and a dwelling for his rest,
   and in both might love, honour, serve, and glorify his Creator. God
   sits in his palace among his best creatures, and thither also will he
   translate man at length, if he be obedient, and observe the ends of his
   creation: thus his goodness appeareth.

   (2.) His power. He brought all things out of the womb of nothing. The
   powerful fiat was enough: Isa. xl. 26, Lift up your eyes on high, who
   hath created these things, and bringeth out their host by number, and
   calleth all things by their names, by the greatness of his might, for
   that he is strong in power?' The force of the cause appeareth in the
   effect, and God's power in the life and being of the creature. There is
   no artificer but he must have matter to work upon, or else his art will
   fail him and he can do nothing; all that man can do is to give some
   shape and form, or to fashion that in some new model which had a being
   before: but God made all things out of nothing; the inclination and
   beck of his will sufficeth for his great works. We have great toil and
   sweat in all things that we do, but behold what a great work is done
   without any pain and travail! It is troublesome to us to carry up a
   little piece of stone or timber to any building of ours, but God
   stretched out all these heavens in such an infinite compass by the word
   of his power, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.

   (3.) His wisdom. The admirableness and comely variety of God's works
   doth easily offer it to our thoughts. In the frame of the work you may
   easily find out a wise workman: Ps. cxxxvi. 5, Sing praises to him that
   by wisdom hath made the heaven and the earth, for his mercy endureth
   for ever:' so Prov. iii. 19, The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth,
   by understanding hath established the heavens: the wisdom of God
   appeareth in the order of making, and order of placing all the
   creatures. In making them, in simple things God began with those that
   were most perfect; as his first creature was light, which of all
   qualities is the most pure and defecate, and is not stained by passing
   through places most impure: then all the other elements. In mixed
   bodies God took another method, from imperfect to perfect; first things
   that have a being, as the firmament, then life, as plants, then sense,
   as beasts, then reason, as men: first God would provide the places of
   heaven and earth, then the creatures to dwell in them; first the food,
   then the creatures to be sustained by it. Provision was made for the
   inhabitants of the earth, as grass for beasts, and light for all living
   and moving creatures. Plants have a growing life, beasts a feeling
   life. Then man was made, last of all creatures, as most excellent. Thus
   God would teach us to go on from good to better. Man's palace was
   furnished with all things necessary, and they were placed and disposed
   in their apt cells for the beauty and service of the whole, and then
   like a prince he was sent into the world to rule and reign. There are
   not so many animals in the earth as in the sea, to avoid the great
   waste of food which would be consumed by the beasts of the land to the
   prejudice of man. But there is no end of these considerations. Only let
   me tell you, power is most eminently discovered in the creation: Rom.
   i. 20, The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
   clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
   eternal power and godhead.' The first apprehensions which we are
   possessed with, and which are most obvious, are the infinite greatness
   and power of the Creator.

   [2.] These are manifested in the whole structure of his word; his power
   in the histories and prophecies, which declare what God hath and shall
   do; his wisdom in the precepts and counsels, and discovery of such
   mysteries; his goodness in promises, institutions, and provisional
   helps. More particularly in the law part of his word, his goodness;
   that showeth man what is good: Micah vi. 8, He hath showed thee, O man,
   what is good:' his power, in threatening such punishments and promising
   such rewards, and in the wonderful efficacy of his word in the
   conscience; his wisdom, in stating such a rule, that hath such an
   admirable fitness for the governing and regulating of mankind. But
   though all three shine forth in the law, and all in each part, yet his
   wisdom is most eminent: Deut. iv. 6, Keep these statutes, for this is
   your wisdom and understanding.' In the gospel, still these three
   attributes appear--the wonderful wisdom, power, and goodness of God.
   His wisdom in the orderly disposure of the covenant of grace: 2 Sam.
   xxiii. 5, Although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with
   me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure; for this is
   all my salvation and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.'
   And contriving the excellent design and plot of salvation by Christ: 1
   Tim. iii. 16, Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the
   flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the
   Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up to glory.' His power in
   the incarnation, resurrection, and miracles of Christ; therefore Christ
   is called the wisdom and power of God.' But above all his love is
   magnified in the gospel: Rom. v. 8, God commendeth his love towards us,
   in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:' 1 John iv. 9,
   10, In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
   sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
   him: herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
   sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins;' Titus iii. 4, But
   after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
   appeareth.'

SERMON LXII.

   I have remembered thy name, Lord, in the night, and have kept thy
   law.--Ver. 55.

   [3.] THESE are discovered in daily providence. To rub up and revive our
   thoughts, God is pleased anew to set before us the glorious effects of
   his wisdom, goodness and power; his wisdom in the contexture of
   providence, his power in the management of it, his goodness in the
   effects of it. His wisdom in the beauty and order of his works, in
   guiding the course of nature, and disposing all things about his
   people. He doeth all things well: Eccles. iii. 11, He hath made
   everything beautiful in its time,' or in the true and proper season;
   therefore, we that look upon providence by pieces, stumble at the
   seeming confusion and uncertainty of what falleth out, as if the
   affairs of the world were not under a wise government; but stay a
   little while till all the pieces of providence be put together in one
   frame, and then you will see a marvellous wisdom in them. In the work
   of creation, all things were very good,' Gen. i. 31; so for these six
   thousand years, as well as for the first six days. Those things which
   seem confused heaps when they lie asunder, when put together will
   appear a beautiful structure and building. So for his goodness. What
   part hath God been acting in the world for so long a time but that of
   mercy? He may be traced more by his acts of goodness than vengeance:
   Acts xiv. 17, Nevertheless he left not himself without witness,
   agathopoion, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and
   fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with joy and gladness.' The whole
   world is a theatre of mercy. If at any time we wrest punishment out of
   his hand, it is with an aim of mercy: as he threateneth that he may not
   punish, so he punisheth that he may not punish for ever. For his power,
   that is notably discovered to us every day. If we would draw aside the
   covering of the creature, you might soon see the secret almighty power
   of God which acteth in everything that falleth out; the same
   everlasting arm that made the creatures is under them to support them:
   Heb. i. 3, He upholdeth all things by the word of his power.' As they
   started out of nothing by his command, so they are kept from returning
   into nothing by the same powerful word, command, and decree of God:
   Thou hidest thy face, and they are troubled; thou takest away their
   breath, and they die; thou sendest out thy Spirit, and they are
   created; and thou renewest the face of the earth,' Ps. civ. 29, 30, All
   things hold their life of him. If God withdraweth in any measure the
   wonted influence of his power from them, they presently find a change
   in themselves. It is even with the being and faculties of the creature
   as. with the image of the glass, which, when the face removeth, it is
   seen no more. The Lord doth as it were breathe into them a being, and
   when he taketh in his breath they perish, and when he sendeth it out
   again they are renewed. Now, though God doth constantly discover his
   wisdom, power, and goodness, yet in some providence one of these doth
   more especially appear; his wisdom in some notable contrivance and
   chain of causes, which to a common eye seemed to have no tendency to
   such effects as are produced by them; as when out of the sins and
   perverse doings of men, or the disorders and confusions of the world,
   he raiseth his own glory, or by some unthought-of, unheard-of means
   bringeth about the deliverance of his people, taking the wise in their
   own craftiness. Sometimes his power, when by weak and contemptible
   means he bringeth great things to pass, and a straw becometh a spear in
   the hand of the Almighty. Sometimes in his goodness, in filling us with
   blessings, or doing notable acts of grace for his people's sake.

   [4.] These three attributes suit with God's threefold relation to us.
   By his almighty power he becometh our creator; as most wise, our
   supreme governor; as most good, our gracious benefactor. We depend upon
   him for our present supplies, and from him we expect our future hopes.
   His creation gives him a right to govern us, his wisdom a fitness, and
   his bounty doth encourage us voluntarily to give up ourselves to his
   service.

   [5.] These three attributes do most bind our duty on us, as they beget
   in us love, fear, and faith, or esteem, reverence, and trust, which are
   the three radical graces that result from the very being and owning of
   God, and are the cultus naturalis enjoined in the first commandment.
   His wisdom as a lawgiver begets reverence and fear; his goodness is the
   object of love, and his power of trust. If he be most wise, there is
   all the reason in the world that he should rule and govern us; for who
   is fitter to govern and make laws than he that is most wise? If he be
   most good, infinitely good, there is all the reason in the world that
   you should love him, and no show of reason why you should love the
   world and sin before him. If powerful and all-sufficient, there is all
   the reason you should believe in him, as one that is able to make good
   his word, either by promise or threatening. Faith goeth upon that: Rom.
   iv. 21, he was strong in faith, being fully persuaded that what he had
   promised he was able to perform.' He is God all-sufficient, therefore
   his promises are not to be distrusted, his threatenings not to be
   slighted. There is no resisting or standing out against him, in the
   twinkling of an eye he can tear you in pieces, pluck away the guilty
   soul from the embraces of the unwilling body. A spark of his wrath
   makes thee a burthen to thyself. So for promises; one word of his mouth
   can accomplish all the good that is contained in them. And it is
   observable that the respects of the creature, that are peculiarly due
   to one of these attributes, are sometimes in scripture directed to
   another. It is said, Hosea iii. 5, They shall fear the Lord and his
   goodness in the latter days:' and love him for his power and greatness,
   and believe in him for his wisdom. Again, they trust him for his
   goodness, love him for his wisdom, fear him for his power; all these
   changes are in scripture.

   Secondly, Why God is best remembered when his name is studied? The
   reason is, because the study of his name doth increase those three
   fundamental radical graces before mentioned.

   1. The studying of his name increaseth our love: Thy name is as an
   ointment poured forth, therefore the virgins love thee,' Cant. i. 3.
   Ointment kept close in the box doth not diffuse its savour, but
   ointment poured forth is full of fragrancy and reviving, it perfumeth
   the whole house: John xii. 3, The house was filled with the odour of
   the ointment.' So when the name of God is not considered, we are not
   comforted and strengthened and quickened; but pour it forth, take it
   abroad in your serious thoughts and believing meditations, and that
   doth attract and draw hearts to him. When we consider the mercy, grace,
   power, wisdom, truth, and justice of God, these affect all those that
   have any spiritual discerning. This is the way to draw esteem from
   carnal hearts; he hath authority to make laws, for he is the wise God;
   power to back this authority, for he is the almighty Creator, who can
   frown thee into nothing; but yet he is good and gracious, ready to
   receive you, and pardon, and do you good, though you have rebelled
   against him. To pour out this name is our duty, and then poor creatures
   will be prevailed with: it is our duty to do it in the discoveries of
   the gospel, your duty to ponder upon it in your private meditations.
   The wisdom of God in the word showeth your duty, his power what need
   you have to bind it on your hearts; and your case is not without hope,
   for you have to do with a good God: there is no mercy to such as fear
   not his powerful justice, and no justice for such as flee from it to
   his mercy. See how God poureth out his name: Exod. xxxiv. 5-7, And the
   Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed
   the name of the Lord; and the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed
   the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
   abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
   iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
   guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and
   upon the children's children unto the third and fourth generation.'

   2. The studying of God's name increaseth our faith and trust: Ps. ix.
   10, They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.' God is first
   known, and then trusted, and then served. If God were known more he
   would be more trusted, and if he were more trusted we would not be so
   double-minded and unstable in the profession and practice of godliness.
   We little study God, and because we study his name so little, our faith
   is weak, and therefore we are so uncertain in our conversations. It is
   well when all our comfort and duty is immediately fetched out of the
   name of God, or his nature considered by us.

   3. The studying of God's name increaseth our reverence and fear: Ps.
   cxi. 9, Holy and reverend is thy name;' Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Unite my heart
   to the fear of thy name.' The more you study the nature of God, the
   more awe-ful, serious, humble, watchful will you grow. Thus you see
   serious and becoming thoughts of God do much increase our faith, fear,
   and love.

   Use. The use is to exhort you more--

   1. To study the name of God, and to dwell upon the meditations of the
   Almighty, and to possess your mind with him till no place be left for
   sin or vanity.

   [1.] The name of his being. God is not only the best of beings, but
   properly that which is; because he is a self-being, that gave being to
   all things else, and from everlasting to everlasting. We are but as it
   were of yesterday, and our being is from him, and our life in his
   hands; we cannot live an hour without him, nor fetch a breath without
   him, nor think a thought, nor speak a word, nor stir a hand or foot
   without him. There is a continual providential influence and
   supportation: as the beams of the sun vanish as soon as the sun is
   clouded, so do we fail when God suspends his influence. A watch goeth
   of itself, a mill of itself when the workman taketh off his hand from
   them: it is not so with us and God; for, Acts xvii. 28, In him we live,
   move, and have our being.' What Paul said of spiritual life, Gal. ii.
   20, is true also of life natural, I am, yet not I, but God is all in
   all.' He is in us, and liveth in us, or we could not subsist for a
   moment. We need not seek God without in the workmanship of heaven and
   earth, for we have God within ourselves, and may feel him and find him
   in our own life and motion; as the child in the womb liveth by the life
   of the mother, before it is quickened and liveth apart by a life and
   soul of its own; or as a pipe sounds by the blowing of the musician; if
   he stop his breath it is altogether silent; so we live and breathe in
   God, and all the tune able variety of our motions cometh from his
   breathing in us. Now, if God be so near us, shall we not take notice of
   his presence, and carry ourselves accordingly? Shall we offend him and
   affront him to his face, and displease him without whom we cannot live?
   But alas! how seldom do we reflect upon this! How is it that we move
   and think not with wonder of the first mover in whom we move? How is it
   that we live and persevere in being, and do not consider of this
   fountain and self-being who gave our life to us, and still continues
   it? Oh, the negligence of many souls professing the knowledge of God
   and godliness! We speak, walk, eat, and drink, and go about all our
   business, as if we had a self-being and independent, never thinking of
   that all-present and quickening Spirit that acts us, moveth in us,
   speaketh in us, maketh us to walk, eat, drink, and do all the functions
   of nature; like the barbarous people who see, hear, speak, and reason,
   and never once reflect upon the principle of all these--a soul within.

   [2.] Let us think often of the name of God, his attributes.

   (1.) Of his wisdom, that we may compose ourselves to worship, adore
   him, serve him according to his will and pleasure, and may admire him
   in the justice and equity of his laws, and the excellent contrivance of
   his providence, that so we may submit to the directions of the one and
   the determinations of the other. To the directions of his word: Can we
   count God to be a wise God, and refuse his counsel? Doth not our
   practice give our profession the lie when we rather walk after our
   hearts' counsels, and the examples and fashions of the world, than
   observe the course God hath prescribed to us in the word? Who, then, is
   thought wise--God or men? So for submission to the determination of his
   providence. The flesh would fain be pleased, and therefore quarrelleth
   many times at God's dispensations as harsh and severe; but in good
   earnest who is wiser--God or men? Do we think we are fitter to sit at
   the helm, and govern and steer all affairs, than the wise Creator of
   heaven and earth? Shall we sit as judges upon his actions, and think
   that might have been prevented, this might have been better ordered,
   either for God's interest or our own comfort? Men will be teaching God
   how to govern the world; for we prescribe to him as if he did not
   understand what were fit for us: he pleaseth us not in his wisest
   dispensations, and we bear it out as if we could mend his works: Job
   xxi. 22, Shall any teach God knowledge?' Those that disallow of God s
   proceedings take upon them to be God's teachers. It was a blasphemous
   speech of Alphonsus, Si Deo a consiliis adfuisset in creatione mundi,
   multa se consultius ordinaturum--if he had been of God's counsel when
   he made the world, he would have ordered many things better. Many abhor
   such a gross speech, yet think almost to the same effect. If they had
   the governing of the world, such men should not prosper; such and such
   things should not be done.

   (2.) The name of his power. Oh! think often of that almighty power that
   maketh and conserveth all things, that giveth a being to you and every
   creature, and will do so to his promises, though never so unlikely; for
   what cannot he do that bringeth all things out of nothing by his word?
   Therefore our confidence in him should be more strong and steadfast;
   for why should we have any jealousies and distrusts of him who is
   omnipotent? In your greatest wants he is all-sufficient, and can supply
   you: Gen. xvii. 1, I am the almighty God; walk before me, and be thou
   perfect.' In your greatest dangers he can deliver you: Dan. iii. 17,
   Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
   furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.' In your
   lowest estate he is able to raise you up: Rom. xi. 23, And they also,
   if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in; for God is
   able to graff them in again.' Whatever difficulties oppose themselves
   against the thing promised, he can remove them, for nothing is too hard
   for the Almighty: Phil. in. 21, He is able to subdue all things to
   himself.' How weak and despicable soever the visible means be, God can
   work by them: 2 Chron. xiv. 11, It is nothing with thee to help,
   whether with many, or them that have no power.' All is alike to
   omnipotency. Instruments or means may be too great for God's honour to
   be used, never too small or weak for him to work by.

   (3.) The name of his goodness. God is infinitely good, effectually
   good, independently good, and all-sufficiently good. If good be amiable
   in our eyes, so should God be. He hath all that is lovely in the
   creatures in a more eminent degree, and therefore our affections, that
   are scattered to them, should be united in God. He is the supreme good,
   and the fountain of all goodness. Oh! how should we love this God, and
   that above all things in the world, or else we do not love him aright.
   This is that which draweth in your hearts to him, and upon this should
   your thoughts dwell. He showed his goodness to you in creation, when he
   made you a little lower than the angels; but much more in redemption,
   when he preferred you above the angels; for he did not take hold of
   angels, but took hold of the seed of Abraham.' What should you be doing
   but admiring of this, and showing forth the virtue and force of this
   love? God is love, and dwelleth in love,' 1 John iv. 16. Oh! shall the
   paltry things of this world draw off your love from God, who is
   goodness itself? Let this prevail with you to lay down all your doating
   upon the creature, that you may no more follow the shadow, but cleave
   to the substance. We owe all that we are, all that we have, all that we
   hope for, to his goodness; and therefore let us consecrate and dedicate
   ourselves to his service and glory.

   2. To study it so as some good may come of it. We should keep our
   thoughts on this holy subject--

   [1.] Till we admire God. The degree of the saints' knowledge here below
   is only to proceed to admiration: Ps. viii. 1, O Lord, our Lord, how
   excellent is thy name in all the earth!' When we have studied God,
   silence will be the best eloquence, and admiration advance him more
   than speech. Admire the name of his being. Creatures in their highest
   glory may be described, an account may be given of them; but his nature
   is Wonderful, can be admired, but not told. Admire his wisdom: Ps. civ.
   24, O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them
   all.' Admire his love: Oh, how excellent is thy loving-kindness! Ps.
   xxxvi. 7; Oh, how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
   them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
   thee before the sons of men!' Ps. xxxi. 19. The name of his power: Ps.
   cxlv. 3, Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; his greatness is
   unsearchable.' The object is too big for the faculty: it is a contempt
   of God when we think of him and do not admire him. Oh, the riches of
   his wisdom, height of his power, breadth of his love!

   [2.] Till we make some practical improvement of him; otherwise to know
   God is but a vain speculation, a work of curiosity rather than of
   profit. By the sight of God the heart must be--

   (1.) Drawn off from the creature, self, and sin.

   (2.) Drawn unto God.

   (1.) Drawn off--

   (1st.) From the creature. That is a true sight of God which abaseth all
   things beside God, not only in opinion but affection; that attracteth
   and uniteth the soul to God, and draweth it off from all created
   excellences. The sight of God's purity darkens the purity of the
   angels, and staineth the pride of all created glory: Job iv. 18,
   Behold, he put no trust in his servants, and his angels he charged with
   folly.' So that is a true sight of God's excellency that draweth off
   the heart from the vain, changeable, and empty shadow of the creature;
   and God is not truly amiable to us till this effect be in some measure
   wrought in us: 1 John ii. 15, Love not the world, neither the things
   that are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the
   Father is not in him.' So that our love to God will be known by the
   decay of our love to earthly things.

   (2d.) From self. A sight of God will best discover thyself unto
   thyself, that in the light of God's glorious majesty thou mayest
   distinctly behold thine own vileness and misery. Esaias, when he saw
   God in vision: Isa. vi. 5, Then said I, Woe is me. for I am undone,
   because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
   people of unclean lips, and mine eyes have seen the king, the Lord of
   hosts.' That is the use he made of this glorious sight: he knew,
   doubtless, something of this before, but now is affected as if he had
   never seen it. The glory of God shining on him doth not lift him up in
   arrogancy and conceit of the knowledge of such profound mysteries, but
   he is more abased in himself; this light made him see his own
   uncleanness. So Job xlii. 5, 6, I have heard of thee by the hearing of
   the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee; therefore I abhor myself in dust
   and ashes.' As long as it was hearsay, Job thought himself some thing,
   and might reflect upon himself and actions with a kind of complacency
   and delight; but now he could not look upon himself with any patience.
   Self-love maketh us loathe other men's sins more than our own, and
   hindereth us from representing ourselves to ourselves in a true shape.
   It is the mere speculative knowledge of God, and science falsely so
   called that puffeth up; but a true knowledge of God breedeth
   self-loathing.

   (3d.) From sin: it draweth off the heart. This remembrance will
   represent filthiness as filthiness without a covering. Sin is a
   deformity to God, as contrariety to his laws, the purity and goodness
   of his essence, and wisdom of his laws; yea, an act of rebellion and
   disloyalty against his sovereignty. Sin still is greatened by the
   consideration of God and a reflection upon his nature; as against his
   authority, purity, goodness, so there is unkindness, disobedience, and
   a blot in it. Well may the apostle say, 3 John 11, He that doth evil
   hath not seen God.'

   (2.) The heart must be drawn unto God by love, fear, and trust; for
   unless we meditate upon God to this end, Though we know God, we do not
   glorify him as God,' Rom. i. 21, till your hearts be moved and inclined
   to love, fear him, and obey him. His being calls for it, that we should
   seek after communion with God, who is such a self-sufficient,
   all-sufficient, and eternal being. Whom would we own, or whose favour
   would we seek? The favour of poor creatures, who are now one thing, now
   another? or the favour of God, who can still say, I am that I am! what
   I was I am, and I will be what I am? Friends are changeable, their
   affections dry up, and they themselves die, and their favour and all
   their thoughts of doing us good perish. There is no end of his duration
   or affection. His attributes call for love; his power rendereth him the
   most desirable friend and dreadful adversary. What more dreadful than
   power that cannot be resisted, wisdom that none can be hid from? and
   what more lovely than his love? Surely if we did study his name, his
   promises, and threatenings, it would have more power with us: how would
   we seek to him, and submit to his blessed will, and depend on him, as
   those that have nothing in our selves, nor anything else in the world
   had being without him! We would then believe all opposite powers to be
   nothing, and wink at either the dreadfulness or loveliness of the
   creature, while the eye of our souls is wholly taken up with the sight
   of God; our desires would be to him, and our delights in him, and being
   deadened to the creature, would wholly cleave to him.

   Doct. 3. Those that have spiritual affections will take all occasions
   to remember God's name. In adversity, for their comfort: Isa. xxvi. 8,
   9, Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee:
   the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee:
   with my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit
   within me will I seek thee early;' Isa. l. 10, Who is among you that
   feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh
   in darkness and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord,
   and stay upon his God.' In prosperity, for a regulation and restraint
   to their affections, that they might not too freely run out on the
   creature to the wrong of God. It is said of the wicked, Ps. lv. 19,
   Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God;' but God's
   children remember him in their comforts: Deut. viii. 10, 11, When thou
   hast eaten and art full, thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good
   land which he hath given thee; beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
   God;' so ver. 18, Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for he it is
   that giveth thee power to get wealth.' In company they will be speaking
   of God: Eph. v. 4, alla eucharistia, but rather giving of thanks.'
   Alone they will be thinking of God; so that when they are alone, they
   are not alone; God is with them in their solitude: John xvi. 32,
   Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered
   every one to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone,
   because the Father is with me.' By day they redeem time, God's statutes
   are their songs; by night when they cannot sleep: When I awake I am
   still with thee,' Ps. cxxxix. 18. Oh, what an advantage it is to have
   the heart thus thronged with thoughts of God in the night! When others
   sleep, good men are awake with God.

   1. Observe this, that which David speaketh of himself was a secret
   duty. Those duties which we perform in secret, and wherein we avoid the
   applause of men, are most sincere, and by them many times we obtain
   most blessing: Mat. vi. 6, Thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
   reward thee openly.' David was the same in secret that he was in the
   light. Other witnesses of our respect to God we need not than God
   himself: it is enough that he seeth us and approveth us. Our desire and
   scope should be to please him, not to appear devout to men, or to be
   esteemed as such by them. Therefore, besides public ordinances, we
   should give ourselves to spiritual exercises in secret.

   2. This was a spiritual duty transacted in the heart by his thoughts.
   The darkness of the night doth riot hinder the delight of the soul; it
   is day within though night without. When a child of God shall see God,
   and be seen of him, though the sun shineth not upon the world, it is
   enough, their hearts are enlightened with God's Spirit.

   3. It was a duty done akai'ros, unseasonably to a vulgar eye. When
   others were buried in sleep, David would awaken sometimes to remember
   God. It is their solace; and spiritual affections and heroical grace
   must not be limited to the ordinary dull way of expressing duty to God.
   They have special affections and special dispensations: Ps. lxiii. 6,
   My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, when I remember
   thee on my bed, and meditate of thee in the night-watches.'

   4. It is not unseasonable. In the night, without distraction, we can
   more freely command our thoughts, for the senses being exercised,
   scatter the mind to several objects: Job xxxv. 10, None saith, Where is
   God, my maker, who giveth songs in the night?' That is matter of
   rejoicing and comfort to poor oppressed creatures. So Ps. xlii. 8, I
   will sing of his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night his
   song shall be with me.' Day and night he was filled with a sense of
   God's love. The reasons are--

   [1.] They are fitted for it, having knowledge and a deep impression of
   the majesty of God upon their hearts: My reins instruct me in the
   night-season,' Ps. xvi. 7. These things that make a deep impression in
   the day, the thoughts will return upon in the night; now God and his
   words are impressed upon them.

   [2.] They delight in it: Ps. civ. 34, My meditation of him shall be
   sweet; I will be glad in the Lord.' They delight themselves in
   beholding the face of God, though not by immediate vision, yet by
   meditation. They are so affected with thoughts of his excellency,
   goodness, kindness, that it is their solace to draw their hearts off
   from all things and persons in the world to that divine object.

   [3.] They profit by it. (1.) As to comfort, it easeth us of many
   sorrowful, troublesome, and weary thoughts. We must fetch our comforts
   from God; the divine nature is the first fountain of them, therefore
   called the God of all comfort,' 2 Cor. i. 3. (2.) As to duty and
   obedience. The reasons of our duty and subjection are most enforced
   from the nature of God; therefore the more we remember the nature of
   God, the more we are quickened to obedience: there we see his infinite
   power, supreme authority, exact holiness, tender love: Let the
   potsherds of the earth contend with one another,' Isa. xlv. 9. Our
   business is to keep God our friend. He hath two properties that make
   him most comfortable or most terrible, according as he is at peace or
   war with us eternity and omnipotency.

   Use. Let us take more occasions to think of God, and that with
   admiration. Many take no more notice of him than if he were not at.
   all; but let us take all occasions: Ps. iv. 4, Commune with your own
   hearts upon your bed.' All the time we can spare from our necessary,
   civil, and natural actions should be employed in calling to mind what
   we have seen, or heard, or felt of God. A loathness and backwardness to
   this duty is an ill sign.

SERMON LXIII.

   This I had, because I kept thy precepts.--Ver. 56.

   IN this psalm the dependence of the verses is neither to be neglected,
   nor too curiously sought after. Many of the sentences have no other
   connection than pearls upon the same string, though some are as links
   in the same chain, fastened one to the other by an apt method and
   order. The design of the penman was to cast all his experiences into
   the order of the Hebrew alphabet; and as there are in the Hebrew
   twenty-two letters, so twenty-two parts or octonaries. Each octonary
   beginneth with the same letter. This sentence which I have read seemeth
   to be independent of the preceding verse, and is the sudden effusion or
   eruption of a gracious heart engaged in the meditation of the fruit of
   obedience: This I had, because I kept thy precepts.' In the words you
   have--

   1. David's assertion of his integrity, I have kept thy precepts.

   2. The gain of this course indefinitely proposed, this I had.

   3. The link between both in the causal particle, because. David doth
   not here tell you what he had, but this and that: this hope, this
   comfort, this quickening, this deliverance; all this I had; that is,
   whatever is good and comfortable. The feminine pronoun Zeth is put
   neutrally, the Hebrew wanting the neuter gender.

   The points are two:--

   First, He that continueth faithful in a course of obedience will find
   at length that it will turn to a good account.

   Secondly, That it is of great use to observe what good cometh to us by
   keeping close to God's ways.

   For the first point, he that continueth faithful in a course of
   obedience will find at length that it will turn to a good account. Here
   three things are to be explained:--

   1. What it is to keep God's precepts.

   2. What is the good that accrueth to us thereby.

   3. The connection between both these, or the reasons and grounds upon
   which we may expect this good.

   1. Let us inquire what it is to keep God's precepts. The phrase is
   often used in scripture, implying a diligent observance of it, and
   obedience thereunto. The term keep relateth to a charge or trust
   committed to us. Look, as on our part we charge Christ with our
   souls--2 Tim. i. 12, I know that he is able to keep that I have
   committed to him'--so Christ chargeth us with his word, that we may be
   chary and tender of it. We charge him with our souls, that he may
   sanctify and save them in his own day; so he chargeth us with his
   precepts, that we may lay them up in our hearts, and observe them in
   our practice. As we would have Christ to be faithful to his trust, so
   should we be in ours, and that even to a tittle: James ii. 10,
   Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in point, he is
   guilty of all.' Now, there is a twofold keeping of God's
   precepts--legal and evangelical.

   [1.] The legal keeping, that is when we keep and perform the
   commandments so exactly as is answerable to the rigour of the law. What
   is that? The law requires perfect and absolute obedience, without the
   least failing in any one point: Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is he that
   continueth not in all things that is written in the book of the law to
   do them.' The least offence, according to that covenant, layeth us open
   to the curse; as for one sin once committed the angels were turned out
   of heaven, and Adam out of paradise. In this sense there is no hope for
   us.

   [2.] There is an evangelical keeping God's precepts, and that is filial
   and sincere obedience; and so they are said to keep God's precepts, not
   they who have no sin in them, but they who study to be free from sin,
   and desire to please God in all things. David had many failings, and
   some of them of a high nature; yet he saith, I have kept thy precepts.
   His purpose and endeavour was to please God in all things. The apostles
   had many failings; they were weak in faith, passionate, full of
   revenge, calling for fire from heaven; a great many failings we may
   find upon record against them; yet Christ returneth this general
   acknowledgment: John xvii. 6, They have kept thy word.' God accepteth
   of our endeavours; when our defects are repented of, he pardoneth them:
   James v. 11, You have heard of the patience of Job;' and we have heard
   of his impatience too, his cursing the day of his birth, and his bold
   expostulation with God; but God putteth his finger upon the scar, and
   mentions that which is commendable. This sincere obedience is known by
   our endeavours after perfection, and our repentance for defects. For
   let me tell you here, that perfect obedience is required under the
   gospel: the rule is as strict as ever it was, but the covenant is not
   so strict. The rule is as strict as ever it was; we are still bound to
   perpetual, personal, and perfect obedience, otherwise our defects were
   no sins: For where there is no law, there is no transgression,' Rom.
   iv. 15. But the covenant is not so strict. This perfect obedience is
   not so indispensably required under the sanction and penalty of the old
   covenant; for the gospel, though it alloweth or approveth of no sin,
   yet it granteth a pardon of course to some sins as they are retracted
   by a general repentance. As sins of infirmity, such as are sins of
   ignorance, which had we known we would not have committed; and sins of
   incogitancy and sudden surreption, which may escape without observation
   of them; and sins of violent temptation, which by reason of some sudden
   assault sway our passions against the right rule; such sins as do not
   arise out of an evil purpose of the mind, but out of human frailty;
   they are consistent with an interest in this covenant, which alloweth a
   means of recovery by repentance, which the law doth not. The law for
   one offence once committed doth condemn a man without leaving him any
   way or means of recovery; but the gospel saith, I came to call sinners
   to repentance,' Mat. ix. 13. It accepteth repentance, and doth not cast
   men off for sins of infirmity. Where there is a general purpose to
   please God, and a hearty sorrow when we offend him, this is the
   sincerity which the gospel accepteth of. In the law, complete innocence
   is required; in the gospel, repentance is allowed: and so he is said to
   keep God's statutes that doth not voluntarily and impenitently go on in
   a course of known sin.

   2. Let me now show the good that cometh to us thereby. David saith
   indefinitely, This I had;' not telling us what good or privilege it
   was, only in the general it was some benefit that accrued to him in
   this life. He doth not say, This I hope for, but, This I had. And
   therefore I shall not speak of the full reward in the life to come. In
   heaven we come to receive the full reward of obedience. But a close
   walker, that waiteth upon God in a humble and constant obedience, shall
   have sufficient encouragement even in this life. Not only he shall be
   blessed, but he is blessed; he hath something in hand as well as in
   hope. As David saith in this 119th Psalm, not only he shall be blessed,
   but he is blessed. As they that travelled towards Zion, they met with a
   well by the way: Ps. lxxxiv. 6, Who passing through the valley of Baca,
   make it a well: the rain also filleth the pools.' In a dry and barren
   wilderness through which they were to pass, they were not left wholly
   comfortless, but met with a well or cistern; that is, they had some
   comfort vouchsafed to them before they came to enjoy God's presence in
   Zion, some refreshments they had by the way. As servants, that beside
   their wages have their vails, so, besides the recompense of reward
   hereafter, we have our present comforts and supports during our course
   of service, which are enough to counter balance all worldly joys, and
   the greatest pleasures that men can expect in a way of sin. Let me
   instance in the benefits that believers find by walking with God in a
   course of obedience, that every one can say, This I had, because I kept
   thy precepts.'

   [1.] Peace of conscience, a blessing not to be valued; and this we have
   because we keep his precepts: Isa. xxxii. 17, The work of righteousness
   shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance
   for ever.' They shall be free from those unquiet thoughts wherewith
   others are haunted. A wicked man's soul is in a mutiny, one affection
   warreth against another, and all against the conscience, and conscience
   against all; but in a heart framed to the obedience of God's will there
   is peace. Pax est tranquillitas ordinis--when every thing keeps its
   place there is peace; when the elements keep their place, and the
   confederacies of nature are preserved, then there is peace: so when a
   man walketh in a holy course there is peace; when the thoughts and
   affections are under rule and government, there is a serenity and quiet
   in the soul. Now, this is never brought to pass in the soul but by
   obedience and holy walking according to the rule of the new creature:
   Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy
   shall be upon them, as upon the whole Israel of God.' Such an accurate
   and orderly life is the only way of obtaining this peace and harmonious
   accord in the soul. So Ps. cxix. 165, Great peace have they that love
   thy law, and nothing shall offend them:' not only peace, but great
   peace--a peace that passeth all understanding, a peace better felt than
   expressed; and this resulteth from obedience, or the government of our
   hearts and ways according to the will of God. Look, as cheerfulness and
   liveliness accompanieth perfect health, or the tunable motion of the
   spirits in the body, so this serenity and quiet in the soul, the
   regular and orderly motion of our faculties; there is a sweet
   contentment of mind resulting from it. The peace of God shall keep your
   hearts and minds through Jesus Christ.' In a troublesome world we need
   to have our hearts and minds kept and guarded from assaults of
   temptations, and diffident vexing cares and fears; and therefore it is
   mightily necessary in those times to get the peace of God, without
   which the soul is upon the rack. Oh, this sweet peace and calm that is
   in our hearts in the midst of all tempests and tossings from without! A
   man is provided and fortified against the apprehension of injuries,
   troubles, dangers, and those heart-cutting cares which otherwise are
   apt to seize upon us. This a believer can say, This peace of conscience
   I had in the midst of all the troubles from without. Now this peace
   others cannot have: Isa. lvii. 21, There is no peace, saith my God, to
   the wicked:' they have not this inward tranquillity and serenity of
   mind; their affections are so unruly, and their consciences so unquiet,
   they are never able to rest.

   But how can this be? None seem to be less troubled than wicked men. I
   answer--There is a difference between a dead sea and a calm sea; a
   stupid conscience: they may have, but not a quiet conscience: their
   consciences are stupefied by drenching their souls in worldly delights
   and pleasures; but the virtue of this opium is soon spent, their
   consciences are easily awakened by the convictions of the word, the
   sting of afflictions, the agonies of death. Well, then, this may the
   composed heart say, I had this peace, this serenity of mind, because I
   kept thy precepts.

   [2.] Next to peace of conscience there is joy in the Holy Ghost; this
   is the fruit of peace, as peace is the fruit of righteousness: Rom.
   xiv. 17, The kingdom of God consisteth not in meat and drink, but in
   righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.' First
   righteousness, and then peace, and then joy in the Holy Ghost. As joy
   of heart and gladness is the fruit of temporal or civil peace, when
   every man may sit under his own vine and his own fig-tree, and reap the
   fruit of his labour without the danger of annoyance; so now, when a man
   can enjoy himself as being reconciled to God, or being at peace with
   him, and hath tasted of the clusters of Canaan, he can rejoice in hope
   of the glory of God,' Rom. v. 11. This is that joy in the Holy Ghost
   which God doth graciously dispense to those that obey his word and
   hearken to the motions of his Spirit. Oh! how may a believer triumph
   and say, This I had because I kept thy precepts!' Joy is the fruit of
   holiness, and the oil of grace maketh way for the oil of gladness: Ps.
   cxix, 14, I rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies more than in all
   riches.' David experienced the joys of obedience, and the joys of a
   crown: now saith David, I rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies more
   than in all riches:' not in the contemplation, but in the way. This was
   a joy that did result from practical obedience, which is more than the
   possessions and treasures of the world. Many picture religion in their
   fancies with a sour and austere face, and think it inviteth men to
   nothing but harsh and unpleasant courses. Oh, no! It inviteth you to
   the highest contentment the creature is capable of, the joy in the Holy
   Ghost, which is unspeakable and glorious.' A sensualist, that runs
   after the dreggy delights of the flesh, is the veriest fool in the
   world; for he can never have any true joy, it is but frisks of mirth
   (while conscience is asleep), but when it is gone, it leaveth a sting
   behind it.

   [3.] Increase of grace. This is another benefit we get by keeping God's
   precepts: They go from strength to strength,' Ps. lxxxiv. 7; as they
   that went to the feast at Jerusalem; they went from troop to troop; so
   they are brought forward in their way to heaven. God, that punisheth
   sin with sin, rewardeth also grace with grace. The one is the most
   dreadful dispensation that God can use. When men have gone on in a
   course of sin, God often punisheth one sin with another, so that they
   are plunged deeper and deeper every day in the gulf of profaneness. But
   it is most comfortable when godliness increaseth upon our hands, and
   God is still perfecting his own work in us: Rom. vi. 19, As you have
   yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto
   iniquity, so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
   holiness.' It standeth us upon to observe the growth of grace, as we
   were formerly conscious of the growth of sin. Shall we be more earnest
   to damn ourselves than to save ourselves? There is no man but in his
   carnal estate might observe how he departed from God by degrees, and
   his heart was hardened by degrees. At first he had some light and
   conscience, till he sinned it away and turned his back upon the
   ordinances, which might revive it and keep it awake; and then his sin
   betrayed him further and further into a customary course of
   profaneness. I say, a carnal man may trace the growth of sin in his own
   heart step by step, and say, This I had because I slighted such a check
   of conscience, despised such an ordinance, fell into such an enormous
   practice:' for God forsaketh none till they first forsake him. So may a
   child of God trace his gradual increase in holiness: this I had by
   hearkening to the counsel of God at such a time against the reluctancy
   of my flesh. There is no duty recovered out of the hands of difficulty
   but bringeth in a considerable profit to the soul: Prov. iv. 18, The
   way of the just is a shining light, which shineth more and more to the
   perfect day.' Look, as the day decreaseth the night increaseth, till it
   cometh to thick darkness; so by every sin men grow worse and worse,
   till at last they stumble into utter darkness. But the way of the just
   is a growing light; it increaseth always into more durable resolutions
   and exact practice of godliness, till it come to the high noon of
   perfection. David taketh notice of the fruit of obedience: Ps. xviii.
   24, The Lord accept of me according to the cleanness of my hands.'

   [4.] Another benefit that we have is many gracious experiences and
   manifestations of God vouchsafed to us in the way of obedience. In the
   present world God and believers are not strange to one another; a man
   that walketh close with him will meet him at every turn: Ps. xvii. 15,
   As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness.' The Psalmist there
   preferreth his present condition before the greatest happiness of
   carnal men. Why? Because he had opportunity of beholding the face of
   God, or enjoying the comforts of his presence. But how? In
   righteousness, in a strict course of obedience. If God be a stranger to
   others, they may thank themselves: John xiv. 21, He that hath my
   commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that
   loveth me is loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifest
   myself to him.' Holiness is the only way to clear up our right to these
   great comforts of the gospel; and if you would get experience of them,
   make conscience of obedience, and be exact and punctual with God, and
   you will not want your refreshments and visits of love, and expressions
   of his grace and favour to you: those sensible proofs and
   manifestations God will not give to us but in a way of obedience; so
   the promise runneth, He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, to
   him will I manifest myself:' so ver. 23, If a man love me, and keep my
   commandments, my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and
   take up our abode with him.' These are taken into sweet fellowship and
   communion with God, and the blessed Trinity will take up their abode in
   his heart. But pray, mark, Christ, that is so tender and willing to
   communicate the influences of his grace, yet standeth upon his
   sovereignty, and therefore still insisteth upon keeping his precepts,
   if they would par take of his comforts.

   [5.] Protection in their work. They are under the special care and
   conduct of his providence while they keep his precepts: He keepeth them
   as in a pavilion; thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence
   from the pride of men,' Ps. xxxi. 20. And who are they that are kept?
   Those that fear him and trust in him,' ver. 19. Pray, mark, when they
   had no visible defence, when they seemed to be left open as a prey to
   the oppressions and injuries of their potent adversaries, yet there is
   a secret guard about them, and they are kept the world knoweth not how:
   God's favour and providence is their sure guard and defence. Whatever
   contentious and proud men design and threaten against them, yet they
   never have their full will upon them. Many a child of God hath ridden
   out the storm, and may come and say This I had, because I kept thy
   precepts.' This it is to keep close to God and hold fast our integrity.
   Elsewhere the Lord expresseth himself to be a wall of fire round about
   his people,' Zech. ii. 5, which should affright at a distance, and
   consume near at hand. In those countries, when they lay in the fields,
   they made fires about them to keep off the wild beasts; so God, when he
   seeth it fit to excuse his people from trouble, he can in the most
   unsafe times, and when they are weakest, protect them by his secret
   hand, bridling their enemies and making their attempts ineffectual.
   Satan is sensible of this privy guard: Job i. 10, Hast thou not made a
   hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on
   every side?' The world seeth not this invisible guard, but the devil
   seeth it. There is no gap open for mischief to enter and break in upon
   them. This can God do when he pleaseth; and a man that holdeth fast his
   integrity, and goeth on in his duty referring himself to God's keeping,
   shall have experience of it, and when the danger is over, say, This I
   had, because I kept thy precepts.'

   [6.] In public and common judgments God maketh a difference; and some
   of his choice ones are marked out for preservation, and are as brands
   plucked out of the burning, whilst others are consumed therein. This is
   done oftentimes, I cannot say always. The Jews have a proverb that two
   dry sticks may set a green one on fire: a good man may perish in the
   common judgment, that is the meaning of the proverb. And sometimes
   their condition may be worst; as Jeremiah: the whole city was besieged,
   and he in the dungeon. Chaff and corn is threshed in the same floor,
   but the corn is ground and baked. But this is the best way we can take
   to be hid in the common calamity, though there be not an absolute
   certainty; for the comfort is but propounded with a possibility: Zeph.
   ii. 3, Seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in
   the day of the Lord's anger.' Though God hath a peculiar eye to the
   godly, yet their temporal safety is not put out of all doubt; it may
   be, or it may not be; but their eternal comforts are sure and safe. Yet
   strict and humble walking is the only way; and in some cases God
   showeth that there shall be a distinction between Ins people and
   others, and when others are overwhelmed, they shall be preserved; as
   Eccles. viii. 12, Surely I know it shall be well with them that fear
   the Lord, which fear before him; but it shall be ill with the wicked;'
   and Isa. iii. 10, Say unto the righteous it shall be well with him, for
   they shall eat of the fruit of their doings; but say unto the wicked it
   shall be ill with them, for the work of his hands shall be given to
   him;' and Jer. xv. 11, Verily it shall be well with this remnant: I
   will cause the enemy to treat them well in the day of evil and
   affliction.' All these places speak of delivering them from trouble, or
   moderating the trouble to them. If there be an uncertainty in the
   thing, yet a probability; but whenever it is done, it is a singular
   favour, and we must own it as the fruit of obedience: This I had,
   because I kept thy precepts.' We must expect the temporal reward of
   godliness with much submission, and venture upon his providence.

   [7.] So much of sanctified prosperity as shall be good for them: Mat.
   vi. 33, First seek the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof,
   and these things shall be added.' God will cast them into the bargain;
   and though he may keep them low and bare, yet no good thing will he
   withhold,' Ps. lxxxiv. 11. So that a child of God surveying all his
   comforts may say, This and that and the other mercy I had from the
   Lord's grace; these comforts and these deliverances came in because I
   kept thy precepts.'

   3. The next thing is to show you what connection there is between these
   two, obedience and this good, or the reason of the Lord's dealing thus.

   [1.] God doth it partly out of his general justice, as he is governor
   of the world: his holy nature doth delight in holiness, and therefore
   it is requisite, ut bonis bene sit, et malis male--that it should be
   well with them that do well, and evil with them that do evil, and such
   dealing a man should have from God as he dealeth out to God: Ps. xviii.
   25, 26, With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, and with the
   upright thou wilt show thyself upright, and with the pure thou wilt
   show thyself pure, and with the froward thou wilt show thyself
   froward.' In the general, that it should be well with the righteous,
   and ill with the wicked; there is an argument in the governing justice
   of God: but then, to come to particulars, that it should be so ill with
   the wicked, here is exacta ratio justi; but that it should be so well
   with men imperfectly righteous, this is moderate justice mixed with
   undeserved mercy.

   [2.] There is his gracious promise and covenant; heaven and earth are
   laid at the feet of godliness: 1 Tim. iv. 8, Godliness hath the promise
   of this life and that which is to come.' Something during our service
   in this world.

   The second point is, that it is of no small benefit to see and observe
   what good we have by obedience to God.

   1. It will increase our esteem of his grace. That the little and
   slender obedience that we yield to his law should have such respect and
   acceptance with him as to be recompensed with so much peace, and
   comfort, and protection, and so many blessings: Lord, what am I, and
   what is my father's house?' Oh, what a good master have we! When the
   saints are crowned, they cast their crowns at the Lamb's feet, Rev. iv.
   10. We hold all by his mercy: Luke xvii. 10, When we have done all, we
   are unprofitable servants;' not in compliment, but in truth of heart,
   we are unprofitable servants. That God should respect us, it is not for
   the dignity of the work, but merely for his own grace.

   2. It is of use that we may justify God against the reproaches and
   prejudices of carnal men, who think God is indifferent to good and
   evil, and that all things come alike to all, that it is in vain to be
   strict and precise, that there is no reward to the good: Mal. iii. 14,
   It is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his
   ordinances?' Yea, the temptation may befall God's own children, and be
   forcibly borne in upon their hearts: Ps. lxxiii. 13, Verily I have
   cleansed my hands in vain.' We think all is lost labour. Now, to
   produce the sweet consolations of God, and his temporal supplies, and
   the manifold blessings bestowed upon us, it is a good stay to our
   hearts, and enables us to justify God against the scorns and reproaches
   of the world.

   3. It is of use to check our murmurings. If we endure anything for God,
   we are apt to repine, and pitch upon that evil we receive from his
   hand, passing over the good. A little evil, like one humour out of
   order, or one member out of joint, disturbeth the whole body; so we, by
   poring upon the evil we endure, pass over all his other bounty: Mal. i.
   2, Wherein hast thou loved us?' God cannot endure to have his love
   suspected or undervalued; and yet people are apt to do so when
   dispensations are anything cross to their desires and expectations. But
   now it is a great check, to consider that if we have our troubles, we
   have also our consolations; and we should rather look upon the good
   that cometh to us in pleasing God, than the temporal and light
   afflictions we meet withal in his service: Job ii. 10, Shall we receive
   good at the hands of God, and not evil?'

   4. It is an encouragement to us in well-doing, the more proofs and
   tokens we have of his supportation. We are wrought upon by the senses;
   as Jer. ii. 19, Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy
   backslidings reprove thee: see what an evil and bitter thing it is to
   for sake the Lord;' and ver. 23, See thy way in the valley, and know
   what thou hast done.' As parents, when their children smart for eating
   raw diet, they upbraid them with it: It is for eating your green fruit;
   so doth the Lord come to his people: Now you see the evil of your
   doings. So, on the contrary, it doth engage us to strict walking to see
   how God owneth it; so doth God appeal to us by experience: Have I been
   a land of darkness to you, or a barren wilderness?' Jer. ii. 31; Micah
   ii. 7, Do not my words do good to them that walk uprightly?' Look about
   you, survey all your comforts; did sin procure these mercies, or
   godliness? Have you not found sensible benefit by being sincere in my
   service?

   Object. But is this safe, to ascribe the comfort and blessings that we
   have to our own obedience? Is it not expressly forbidden, Deut. ix. 4,
   Say not in thy heart, For my righteousness hath the Lord brought me to
   possess the land'?

   Ans. 1. David doth not boast of his merits, but observeth God's mercy
   and faithfulness in the fruits of obedience. There is his mercy in
   appointing a reward for such slender services: Gal. vi. 16, As many as
   walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them.' All the
   comfort we have is from mercy; yea, undeserved mercy. Those that walk
   according to this rule stand in need of mercy. Their peace and comfort
   floweth from mercy; they need mercy to cover the failings they are
   conscious to in their walkings. And then consider his truth and
   faithfulness. The reward of well-doing cometh not by the worthiness of
   the work, but by virtue of God's promise: His word doth good to them
   that walk uprightly,' Micah ii. 7. God hath made himself a debtor by
   his promise, and oweth us no thanks for what we can do; it is only his
   gracious promise.

   Ans. 2. David speaketh not this to vaunt it above other men, but to
   commend obedience, and to encourage himself and invite others by
   remembering the fruits of it. There is a great deal of difference
   between carnal boasting and gracious observation. Carnal boasting is
   when we vaunt of our personal worth; gracious observation is when, for
   God's glory and our profit, we observe the fruits of obedience, and the
   benefits it bringeth along with it. That God never gave us cause to
   leave, but to commend his service, and, by what we have found, to
   invite others to come and taste that the Lord is gracious.'

   Use 1. To encourage us in the ways of the Lord and keeping of his
   precepts. It is no unprofitable thing: before we have done we shall be
   able to say, This I had, because I kept thy precepts.' Two things God
   usually bestoweth upon his people--a tolerable passage through the
   world, and a comfortable going out of the world; which is all a
   Christian needeth to care for: here is only the place of his service,
   not of his rest.

   1. He shall have a tolerable passage through the world. A child of God
   may have a hard toilsome life of it, but he hath his mixtures of
   comfort in his deepest afflictions; he hath peace with God, that keeps
   his heart and mind, and maketh his passage through the world tolerable,
   because God is engaged with him: 1 Cor. x. 13, Faithful is he that hath
   called you, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are
   able to bear.' He is freed from wrath, and hath his discharge from the
   curse of the old covenant; he is taken into favour with God, and hath
   as much of temporal relief as is necessary for him; his condition is
   made comfortable to him.

   2. A comfortable passing out of the world: Isa. xxxviii. 3, Remember, O
   Lord,' saith Hezekiah, I have walked before thee with an upright
   heart.' When you lie upon your death-beds, and in a dying hour, how
   comfortable will this be, the remembrance of a well-spent and
   well-employed life in God's service! They that wonder at the zeal and
   niceness of God's children, when they are entering into the other
   world, they cry out then, Oh, that they had been more exact and
   watchful! Oh, that they might die the death of the righteous! They
   should live so. Men then have other notions of holiness than ever they
   had before. But, Christians, here is your comfort; the word of God,
   that hath been your rule, is now your comfort and cordial, and stands
   by you to the very last.

   Use 2. To persuade us to observe the difference between the ways of God
   and the ways of sin. When a man cometh to cast up his account on the
   one side and on the other, oh what a difference is there! Certainly
   there will a time come when you must cast up your account and use this
   recollection, either when your eyes are opened by grace in conversion,
   or when your eyes are opened by punishment. On sin's side consider,
   when you look back to what is past--(the Lord grant you may make this
   reflection!)--Rom. vi. 21, What fruit had you in those things whereof
   you are now ashamed?' You cannot look back without horror of
   conscience; as the unclean person, when he looketh back, and
   considereth that his flesh and body is consumed by sin, Prov. v. 11-13.
   He speaketh there of some noisome disease that hath gotten into his
   body. But then, on the other side, the side of godliness, This I had,
   because I kept thy precepts,' Oh! what peace, what serenity of mind,
   what hopes of eternal life, what comfortable entertainment shall you
   have in heaven! Determine before hand what it will come to. Thus you
   see the difference between a sinful and godly course.

SERMON LXIV.

   Thou art my portion, Lord: I have said that I would keep thy
   words.--Ver. 57.

   DAVID doth in this place make out his right and title, Thou art my
   portion, O Lord,' &c. Here is--

   1. David's protestation, thou art my portion, O Lord.

   2. David's resolution, I have said that I would keep thy words.

   In the first of these, in David's protestation, you may take notice of
   his claim, and of the sincerity of it.

   1. Of his claim to God, Thou art my portion.' A part or portion, in the
   original use of the word, signifies a less quantity taken from a
   greater; a part is used in opposition to the whole. But with respect to
   the matter in hand, it is not used in such a sense, but for our lot and
   happiness; not sensu mathematico, not with reference to a whole, but
   politico et forensi, with respect to choice, interest, and possession;
   and the allusion is taken either from the distribution of the land of
   Canaan, where every one had his portion appointed to him by lot, and
   measured to him by rod and lines: therefore it is said, The lines are
   fallen to me in pleasant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage;' or
   else it is an allusion to the partage of an ordinary estate, where
   every child hath his portion assigned him to live upon. Thus he lays
   claim to God himself.

   2. The sincerity of this claim may be gathered, because he speaks by
   way of address to God. He doth not say barely, He is my portion,' but
   challengeth God to his face, Lord, thou art my portion.' Elsewhere it
   is said, Lam. iii. 24, The Lord is my portion, saith my soul.' There he
   doth not speak it by way of address to God, but he adds, My soul saith.
   But here to God himself, who knows the secrets of the heart. To speak
   thus of God to God argues our sincerity, when to God's face we avow our
   trust and choice; as Peter, John xxi. 17, Lord, thou knowest all
   things; thou knowest that I love thee;' he appeals to God's
   omnisciency; such an appeal is there to God for the truth of this
   assertion; as in that other place, when the believing soul lays claim
   to God, the integrity of that claim is also asserted, not only by the
   lips or mouth, but also the soul. There is oratio mentalis, vocalis,
   vitalis: there is the speech of the heart, in the real inclination of
   it; and the speech of the tongue, in outward profession; and the speech
   of the life, by answerable practice. All three must be joined together;
   what the tongue utters, the heart and life must consent to. All will
   say, God is their portion; but it is not what the tongue says, but what
   the heart saith; and what the heart saith will appear in the course of
   your actions; there is the real proof and evidence of it. Thus much for
   David's protestation, Thou art my portion, O Lord;' he speaks to God
   himself.

   Secondly, Take notice of David's resolution, I have said that I would
   keep thy word.' It is good to see what kind of inference the saints
   draw from this principle, that God is their portion. Sometimes they
   infer thence dependence upon God, sometimes subjection and obedience to
   him; for this principle doth not only establish our comfort, but our
   duty. Sometimes to establish dependence: Lam. iii. 24, The Lord is my
   portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.' I will look for
   all from him, live upon him as a man doth upon his portion. But here
   David infers duty and obedience: I have said that I would keep thy
   words.'

   In this resolution we may observe--

   1. The formality or manner of making, I have said: it is by way of
   practical decree.

   2. The matter of it, I will keep thy words.

   1. For the formality or manner of it, I have said,' I decreed within
   myself, I have fully concluded; here was not a light or inconsiderate
   purpose, but such as was deliberate, fixed, a practical decree upon a
   debate. Whoever would enter upon a strict course displeasing to flesh
   and blood, must seriously consider and then fixedly determine:
   deliberation and determination are both necessary. There must be
   consultation or deliberation, that he may sit down and count the
   charges; otherwise, if profession of godliness be lightly taken up, it
   will be as lightly left. Then there must be determination, or binding
   the heart by firm purpose; and if we join the next verse, supplication
   or begging God's strength, then all is done. Now this firm purpose I
   have said will help against inconstancy, or against backwardness or
   unreadiness of heart. Against inconstancy: Many good motions we start,
   but they die away for want of corning to a resolution, or issuing forth
   a practical decree for God: James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable
   in all his ways.' But David, when he had considered all things, then I
   have said that I will keep thy words;' he was fully resolved. Then it
   will help against laziness, listlessness, and backwardness of heart.
   David, when he was grown shy of God, and his heart hung off from him,
   some great distemper was upon his soul, and he was loath to look God in
   the face, what course did he take then? He issues forth a practical
   decree: Ps. xxxii. 5, I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord.' He
   thrusts himself forward, and charges himself to go to God: I am
   resolved I will break off silence, and open my case to God. Thus we
   must excite ourselves by renewing a decree in the soul; determine, I
   will do thus and thus for God, whatever comes of it.

   2. For the matter, I will keep thy words.' Keeping God's word notes an
   exact and tender respect, when a man keeps it as a jewel, as a precious
   treasure, that it may not be hazarded; or keeps it as the apple of his
   eye,' Prov. vii. 2. The eye is soon offended with the least dust; BO
   when we are chary of the word of God, loath to offend God in anything,
   then are we said to keep his word.

   Two points lie clear in the text:--

   1. That God alone is the godly man's portion.

   2. That those which have chosen God for their portion will manifest it
   by a fixed resolution and strict care of obedience.

   It must needs be so; if God be his portion, his great business will be
   to keep in with him.

   Doct. 1. That God alone is the godly man's portion.

   This will appear by scripture and by reason.

   1. By scripture: Ps. xvi. 5, The Lord is the portion of mine in
   heritance and of my cup.' There is a double metaphor; first, an
   allusion to the shares of the land of Canaan, so God is the portion of
   mine inheritance, saith David; and an allusion to the manner of a
   feast, where every man had his allowance of meat set by his cup: but
   snares and brimstone are said to be the portion of a wicked man's cup.
   As every man had his allowance set by his flagon of wine, especially in
   a solemn feast, so God is the portion of my cup. So Ps. lxxiii. 26, The
   Lord is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever, when my
   flesh and my heart faileth,' that is, when my body yields to the decay
   of nature; yea, when all our courage seems to be lost, borne down by
   difficulties that we endure in the flesh, God is a portion that will
   never fail.

   2. To give some reasons of it. It will appear to be so--

   [1.] By considering what is requisite to a man's portion.

   [2.] Why a godly man looks upon God under this notion.

   First, If a man were left to his free choice, what he would choose to
   take for his portion; not what is his portion in his strait, when he
   can have no better, but if he were left to his free choice:--

   1. He would require that it be something good, or apprehended to be so.

   2. That it be something to which he hath a title and interest, to which
   he can lay claim, or is in possession or expectation of according to
   right.

   3. He would choose that which is suitable to the capacities,
   necessities, and desires of him whose portion it is.

   4. That it be sufficient to supply all his wants, so as he may live
   upon it.

   5. That it be such a thing wherein he may find satisfaction and
   acquiescence, so that he needs seek no more and ask no more.

   6. Such a thing wherein he may take complacency and great delight,
   where he may be well pleased and rejoiced.

   Now, all these things are to be found in God, and with good reason the
   saints make this choice, and say, Thou art my portion, O Lord.'

   [1.] That which is to be chosen for our portion must be good: There is
   none good but one, and that is God,' Mat. xix. 17. It is Christ's own
   proposition: he is good of himself, good in himself, yea, good itself.
   There is no good above him, besides him, or beyond him. But if anything
   else be good, it is either from him or with him. But that I may more
   distinctly speak to this--

   (1.) God is primitively and originally good; the creature is but
   derivatively good. He is good of himself, which nothing else is, the
   fountain-good, and therefore is called the fountain of living waters,'
   Jer. ii. 13. The creatures are hut dry pits or broken cisterns. Other
   things, what good they have it is of him. God must needs be infinitely
   better and greater than they, for all things which are good they have
   from God.

   (2.) God is the chiefest good, and other things are only good in
   subordination. All creature goodness is but a stricture of that perfect
   good which is in God; and therefore, if we find any good in them, that
   should lead us to the greater good, even to the Creator. Who would
   leave the substance to follow the shadow? or desire the picture to the
   dishonour and neglect of the person whom it represents? Certainly so
   they do that run after the creature and neglect God, that seek
   happiness in sublunary enjoyments, to the wrong and neglect of God.
   That small good which the creatures have is not to hold us on to them,
   but to lead us to him, as the streams will direct us to the fountain,
   and the steps of the ladder are not to stand still upon, but to ascend
   higher. If your affections be detained in the creature, you set the
   creature in God's stead; you pervert it from its natural use, which is
   to set forth the invisible things of God, his excellency, his goodness,
   his godhead, and his power to do you good, and to send you to him that
   made them. But how usually doth that which should carry us to God
   divert and detain us from him! If a prince should woo a virgin by a
   messenger, and she should leave him, and cleave to the messenger, and
   those he sent as spokesmen and servants, this were an extreme folly. By
   the beauty and sweetness of the creatures, God's end is to draw us to
   himself as the chiefest good; for that which we love in other things is
   but a shadow and an obscure resemblance of that which is in him. There
   is sweetness in the creature, mixed with imperfection; the sweetness is
   to draw us to God, but the imperfection is to drive us from setting our
   hearts on them. There is some what good in them: look up to the
   Creator; but there is vanity and vexation of spirit, and this is to
   drive us off from these sublunary things.

   (3.) He is infinitely good. In this portion one hath not the less
   because another enjoys it with him. Here is a sharing without division,
   a partaking without prejudice of a co-partner, for every man hath his
   portion whole and entire; it is no less to us because others enjoy it
   too. We straiten others in worldly things so much as we are enlarged
   ourselves; for these things are finite, and cannot be divided but they
   must be lessened, and therefore are not large enough. But this good is
   infinite, and sufficeth the whole world, and every one possesseth it
   entire; as the same speech may be heard of all, yet no man heareth less
   because another heareth it with him; or as the same sun shines upon
   all; I have not the less light because it shines upon another as well
   as me. So God is all in all. If there be any difference, the more we
   possess him the better; as in a choir of voices, every one is not only
   solaced with his own voice, but with the harmony of those that sing in
   concert with him. Worldly inheritance is lessened by a multitude of
   co-heirs. In outward estates many a fair stream is drawn dry or runs
   low by being parted and dispersed in several channels; but God, that is
   infinite; cannot be lessened.

   (4.) He is an eternal good, and so the most durable portion: He is my
   portion for ever,' Ps. lxxiii. 26. The good things of this life are but
   like flowers; they be for a season and then they wither, they are
   perishing and of a short continuance; we carry away nothing of it in
   our hands when we go to the grave. When we leave all other portions and
   inheritances, then we begin, to take possession of this portion; yea,
   at that time when men see the vanity of making other things their
   portion, a child of God sees the happiness of his portion--at death.
   Death blows away all vain deceits; then carnal men begin to perceive
   their error. When their portion comes to be taken away from them, then
   what indignation have they upon themselves for the folly of their
   choice, how the world hath deceived them! A godly man hath the
   beginning here, then he comes to have a consummate and most perfect
   enjoyment of it. Death cannot separate us from our portion. Indeed it
   separates us from all things that withhold us from it, but it is a
   means to perfect our union with God, and make way for our full fruition
   of him. Well, then, if this be that which is required in a portion,
   that it be good, there is none good but God; he is originally,
   independently, chiefly, infinitely, and eternally good, and therefore
   there is reason why we should choose God for our portion.

   [2.] That a thing be our portion, it is necessary that we have an
   interest in it and title to it; not only that it be good, but that we
   may claim it as ours; for that is that which sweeteneth everything to
   us, that it is ours to use. Now God is not only good, but he is also
   ours; he makes over himself to us in covenant, Gen. xvii.; therefore we
   may lay claim to him, as a man to his patrimony or inheritance to which
   he is born, and say, Lord, thou art mine: Zech. xiii. 9, I will say, It
   is my people, and they shall say, The Lord is my God.' As God owns an
   interest in them, so they own him: He is my God; I will be thy God:' so
   saith God in the covenant. It is more than if God had said, I will be
   thy friend, thy father; these are notions of a limited sense. But I
   will be thy God,' that hath an infinite importance, a greater weight
   and efficacy in that expression: I will be thy God,' that is, I will do
   thee good in the way of infinite and eternal power. And that is the
   reason why Christ proves the resurrection from thence: Mat. xxii. 32, I
   am the God of Abraham,' &c.; for to be a God to any is to be a
   benefactor to them, and a benefactor becoming an infinite and eternal
   power. Therefore certainly it assures us of greater things than this
   life affords, something becoming a God to give. If God be Abraham's
   God, a God to his whole person (his soul is not Abraham), then it
   strongly proves the resurrection of the body; then Abraham, both body
   and soul, must have a happiness greater than this life can afford.
   Hence that expression of the apostle, Heb. xi. 16, God is not ashamed
   to be called their God.' These words seem as if they did express God's
   condescension, as if he would be called the God of a few patriarchs.
   No; the meaning of the words is this, in regard of the slenderness of
   their present condition, God could not with honour. What! be a God to
   Jacob, and suffer him to have such a wandering life? He might be
   ashamed to be their God if he had not better things to bestow upon
   them, But he hath provided for them a city,' a heavenly kingdom. Not
   only given them that which they enjoyed in houses, their flocks and
   herds, which were multiplied; these were slender things to take up the
   whole significancy of that expression, I will be their God. But now God
   is not ashamed to be called their God; that is, God can with honour and
   without shame take that title upon him, for he hath everlasting
   happiness in the world to come to bestow upon them. Thus whatever God
   is, hath, or can do, it is thine. Look, as the apostle saith, Heb. vi.,
   that when God had no greater thing to swear by, he swore by himself,'
   so we may say, when he had no greater thing to bestow upon his people,
   he gives and bestows him self, as fully and wholly makes over himself
   to every believing soul, so that they have as full a plea and sure
   right to God as any man hath to his patrimony to which he was born. I
   will act answerably, becoming an infinite power and goodness, for thy
   good. This is the significancy of that ample and glorious expression
   which God useth in the covenant of grace. As when a covenant was made
   between the king of Israel and the king of Judah, the tenor of it was,
   My horses are as thy horses, my strength as thy strength,' 1 Kings
   xxii. 4. So whatever is God's is ours for our benefit, and what is ours
   is God's for his service. Mark, God not only saith, I will be yours,
   but, be a God, that is, I will act like a God. In pardon of sin: Hosea
   xi. 9, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not man.'
   He will not pardon as a man, but, as a God. Man's patience is soon
   spent and soon tired. What! seven times a day forgive my brother? But
   he will pardon as a God. And so, when he sanctifies, he will sanctify
   as a God: 2 Peter i. 3, By his divine power he hath given unto us all
   things that pertain unto life and godliness.' And so in defence and
   maintenance, which is part of the covenant: I will feed, maintain,
   protect thee as a God; that is, not as one that is to be limited in the
   course of second causes. When he pleases he can give us water, not only
   out of the fountain, but out of the rock; when there is nothing visible
   to supply and maintain you, then, I will be a God; then he will glorify
   us like a God, like an infinite and eternal power. For as God is an
   infinite God, so he gives us a far more exceeding weight of glory; and
   as an eternal God, he gives us an eternal weight of glory, 2 Cor. iv.
   17. The glory he bestows upon us suits with the infiniteness and
   eternity of his essence. As it is said of Araunah, that was of the
   royal extraction of the Jebusites, He gave like a king to a king,'
   worthy of his blood and descent; he had a generous mind: so God will
   give like a God; therefore, he not only saith, I will be thine, but, be
   thy God. You think it much when you view a large compass, and can look
   abroad and say, All this is mine; but one that hath chosen God for his
   portion hath much more to say: God is mine.

   [3.] That which a man would make his portion if he were free to choose,
   it should be a proper and suitable good, our own good. The heart of man
   aims at not only bonum, good in common, but also bonum congruum, a
   suitable fitting good. Every element moveth to its own place, and every
   living creature desires food proper to itself. So man is not only
   carried to good, but good that suits to his capacity and necessity. The
   soul, being a spirit, must have a spiritual good. Indeed, as it acts in
   the body, and accommodates itself with the necessities of the body, and
   seeks the good of the body, so it may be carried out to honours,
   pleasures, and profits, for these are the conveniences of the bodily
   life: but as it is a spirit, and can live apart from the body, it must
   have something above these, a spiritual object; and as it is immortal,
   it must have an immortal good. Now, for a spiritual immortal good do we
   grope and feel about until we find it, and then there is a great deal
   of satisfaction: Acts xvii. 27, That they should seek the Lord, if
   haply they might feel after him, and find him.' So we are groping and
   feeling about, as the blind Sodomites did for Lot's door, for some good
   that may suit the capacity of our souls: we were made for God, and
   therefore cannot have full contentment without God. But I speak not now
   of man as man, but suppose him to have a new nature put into him, that
   carries him after satisfaction: We are made partakers of the divine
   nature,' 2 Peter i. 4. It is called so because it comes from God and
   tends to him. Now, there must be something suitable to this nature.
   Pleasure is when those things are enjoyed that suit with us, when the
   object and the faculty are suited. When every appetite hath a fit diet
   to feed upon, then a marvellous deal of pleasure and contentment
   results from thence: Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the flesh do
   mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit, the
   things of the spirit.' All things seek a suitable good. Now, they that
   are after the spirit, that have a new spiritual divine nature put into
   them, renewed souls, they must have an object proper, and therefore
   must have something above the concernments of the body, and above the
   fleshly nature; for everything delights in that which is suitable, as a
   fish in the stream, and an ox to lick up the grass; and man must have a
   suitable good as a rational being; but as a spiritual being, must have
   another good. Grace restores us to the inclinations of nature when it
   was innocent; therefore the soul, that came from God, must centre in
   God, and it cannot be quiet without him.

   [4.] That which a man would make his portion, it must be sufficient to
   supply all his wants, that he may have enough to live upon. Now, saith
   the Lord, I am God all-sufficient,' Gen. xvii. 1; sufficient for the
   necessities of this life, and that which is to come. He is the fountain
   of all blessings, spiritual, temporal, eternal; not only their power
   for ever, but their portion for ever, satisfied with him now and in the
   life to come: Ps. cxlii. 5, Thou art my portion, O Lord, in the land of
   the living.' They expect all from him; not only peace and
   righteousness, grace and glory, but food, maintenance, defence, to bear
   them out in his work. The creature is but God's instrument, or as an
   empty pipe, unless God flow in by it. If God help them not, the
   creature cannot help them. These are streams that have water only so
   long as the spring fills them. Well, then, here is a portion that is
   every way sufficient. All other portions are accompanied with a want,
   but this alone sufficeth all Some things give health, wealth, but not
   peace; some things give peace, but not honour. But God is all to
   us--health, wealth, peace, honour, grace, and glory: All things are
   yours, because you are Christ's, and Christ is God's,' so runs the
   Christian charter; there is omne bonum in summo bono--all things in the
   chiefest good. So Rev. xxi. 7, He that overcometh shall inherit all
   things,' How so? For I will be his God.' He that hath God hath him that
   hath power and command of all things, and therefore shall inherit all
   things, For I will be his God.' And that is the reason of the apostle's
   riddle, 2 Cor. vi. 10, As having nothing, yet possessing all things;'
   that is, all things in God, when they have nothing in the creature.
   Many times they are kept bare and low, but God carries the purse for
   them; all things are at his dispose; and we are kept more bare and low
   that we may be sensible of the strange supplies of his providence.
   Alas! without him in the midst of our sufficiencies we may be in
   straits.

   [5.] That a man would choose that for his portion wherein he may be
   contented, satisfied, and sit down as having enough. Now this is only
   in God. When we choose other things for our portion, still our sore
   runs upon us; there are some crannies and vacuities of soul that are to
   be filled up; if we could satisfy our affections, we cannot satisfy our
   consciences; nothing can content the desires of the soul but God
   himself; other things may busy us, and vex us, but cannot satisfy us:
   All things are vanity and vexation of spirit.' If a man would make a
   critical search, as Solomon did; he set himself to see what pleasures
   and honours would do to content the heart of man, and what riches and
   learning would do; he had a large estate and heart, and so was in a
   capacity to try all things, to see if he could extract satisfaction
   from them; yet he concludes, All is vanity and vexation of spirit.'
   Whosoever will follow this course will come home with disappointment.
   But in this portion there is contentment; we need no more but God, and
   there is nothing besides him worth our desire. Necessities that are not
   supplied by him are but fancies; it is want of grace if we want
   anything else when we have God for our portion: Ps. xvii. 14, From the
   men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
   belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure.' A carnal man's happiness is
   patched up with a great many creatures; they must have dainty fare,
   costly apparel, this and that, and still their sore runs upon them;
   they have a fulness of all things, and yet they are not filled. But
   now, saith David, ver. 15, As for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.'
   Though God do not make out himself in that latitude and fulness as he
   will hereafter, yet at present to have communion with God is enough: I
   shall be filled.' There are some desires that are working after God,
   but they will be filled hereafter. It is true we are not now perfect,
   but that is no fault of our portion, but the defect of our capacity.
   Though we have not that fulness that we shall have hereafter, yet we
   have it initially. Here we have the first-fruits, have it virtually,
   hope and look for it; there is something begun in the soul that will
   increase towards this satisfaction. Certainly this is a portion that
   can alone be possessed with content. God is satisfied with himself and
   sufficient to his own happiness, therefore surely there is enough in
   him to fill the creature. That which fills an ocean will fill a bucket;
   that which will fill a gallon will fill a pint; those revenues that
   will defray an emperor's expenses are enough for a beggar or poor man.
   So, when the Lord himself is satisfied with himself, and it is his
   happiness to enjoy himself, there needs no more; there is enough in God
   to satisfy. If our desires run out after other things, they are desires
   not to be satisfied, but to be mortified. If we hunger after other
   contentments, they are like feverish desires, not to be satisfied, but
   to be abated in the soul; for he that fills all things hath enough to
   fill up our hearts.

   [6.] Complacency and delight. That which a man would take pleasure in,
   there where he may have abundant matter of rejoicing and delight, this
   a man would choose for his portion. Now in God he hath the truest and
   sincerest delight. This is matter of rejoicing; as David saith, Ps.
   xvi. 5, 6, The Lord is my portion.' What then? I have a goodly
   heritage.' Here is that which will revive and refresh my heart enough.
   There is no rejoicing that is sincere but this. As the discomforts of
   the new creature are more real than all other discomforts, and pierce
   deeper--a wounded spirit who can bear?'--so the joys of the new
   creature, none go so deep: Ps. iv. 6, Thou hast put more gladness into
   my heart,' &c. Others do but tickle the senses, a little refresh the
   outward man, please the more brutish part, but this the heart. And this
   is such a joy as can be better felt than uttered: 2 Peter i. 8, it is
   unspeakable,' and none can know the strength and sweetness of it till
   it be felt: a stranger' cannot conceive it, doth not intermeddle with
   his joy,' Prov. xiv. 10. One drop of this is more than an ocean of
   carnal pleasure. When we have other things without God, we can never be
   serious. Take the merriest blades in the world, and dig them to the
   bottom; still there is something of sadness and remorse that doth sour
   all their content: conscience is secretly repining, and ready to
   embitter their joy. Though men strive to bear it down, yet it is ever
   returning upon them; therefore they cannot be truly cheerful. The most
   jolly sinners have their pangs that take off the edge of their bravery.
   Carnal rejoicing makes a great noise, like thorns under a pot, but it
   is but a blaze and gone. But this is a solid joy and comfort, wherewith
   a man may look death in the face with cheerfulness, and think of the
   world to come and not be sad. Alas! a little thing puts the merriest
   sinner into the stocks of conscience. He that makes it his business to
   add one pleasure to another, and spend his days in vanity, how soon is
   his mirth removed! Therefore, if a man would choose a portion to have
   joy at the highest rate, he should choose God for his portion.

   Secondly, How comes a godly man to look upon God under this notion,
   that no less will content him but God himself? Why, he hath another
   apprehension, and another manner of heart to close with him, than
   carnal men; his understanding is enlightened, and his heart inclined by
   grace.

   1. He sees more into the worth of spiritual and heavenly things. He
   hath faith, which is the evidence of things not seen, of things that do
   not lie under the judgment of sense and present reason; he can spy
   things under a veil, and his eyes are opened to see what is the riches
   of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,' Eph. i. 17, 18; and
   therefore he is convinced of the fulness and sufficiency that is in
   God, and the emptiness and straitness that is in the creature; God hath
   given him counsel, his reins instruct him, Ps. xvi. 7. All by nature
   are blind, ignorant, apt to dote upon the creature; but by grace their
   eyes are opened, that they have another manner of discerning, that they
   do not see things only by discourse, but their hearts are affected.
   Others may discourse, but they have not this divine light and spiritual
   understanding, by which spiritual things may be discerned; as matters
   of opinion they may, but not as matters of choice. A carnal man may
   argue out with reason the worth and excellency of God, but he hath not
   a refined apprehension and persuasive counsel, which is in God's
   people.

   2. Their hearts are inclined to choose him for their portion. They do
   not only see an alluring worth in the object, but there is an
   attracting virtue, by which the heart is drawn unto God: John vi. 44,
   No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw
   him.' The great article of the covenant of grace is to take God for our
   God. Now all the articles of the new covenant are not only precepts but
   promises. The conditions of the covenant are conditions in the
   covenant; God gives what he requires. And therefore, as the great
   article of the covenant is to take God for our God, so the great
   blessing of the covenant is to have a new heart, or a new placing of
   our desires and affections. Sin lieth in a conversion from God to the
   creature; grace, in turning us to God again. The change is mainly seen
   in fixing our chiefest good and our last end. God gives his people a
   heart to close with him, and accept of him as their portion, to fix
   upon him as their chiefest good and their last end.

   Use 1. To reprove them that do not take God for their portion. Godly
   men must have God himself; they prefer him above all, and saving grace
   above other benefits, Ps. iv. 6, 7. There is the dispositions of the
   godly and the carnal. The many say, Who will show us any good?' But,
   Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us.' A carnal man is
   for good in common, any good, but not for the light of God's
   countenance; nothing will satisfy the saints but the light of God's
   countenance; they prefer him above his gifts, and among his gifts they
   prefer saving graces and renewing mercies, such as begin, and confirm
   them in their union with God in Christ. But carnal men go no further
   than the world; they choose not God, but his gifts; and among these not
   the best, but the common sort, such as suit with the appetite of the
   fleshly nature, and the more brutish part of these--riches, pleasures,
   and honours; and these too, not as coming from God, but as coming to
   them by chance. They not only say good in general, but who will show
   me,' &c. As they look after uncertain blessings, so they look after an
   uncertain author, as they fall out in the course of second causes. If
   they have these, they bless their hearts, and content themselves. To
   convince these men of the baseness of their choice, and make them
   bethink themselves, their choice is part of their punishment. There
   cannot be a greater punishment than that they should have what they
   choose, that they should be written in the earth, Jer. xvii. 13; they
   shall have this and no more; that God should say to them, Silver and
   gold you shall have, but in this matter no lot nor portion,' Acts viii.
   Their bellies shall be filled with hid treasure, they shall have
   gorgeous apparel, dainty fare, substance enough to leave to their
   babes, but be deprived of heaven. It is the greatest misery that can
   be, to be condemned to this kind of happiness; that we should thus
   degrade ourselves, and sit upon the threshold when they might sit upon
   the throne, and lick only the dust of his footstool. But wicked men
   will not be sensible of this now, but one day they shall, of the misery
   of this their foolish choice; at death usually: Jer. xvii. 11, At his
   latter end he shall be a fool.' Then his heart will rave against him: O
   fool, madman! that thou wert not as careful to get the favour of God,
   as to get this worldly pelf! when he must go into another world, and he
   is launching out into the great gulf of eternity. And in hell they will
   be sensible: Luke xvi. 25, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
   receivedst thy good things,' &c. The conscience of their foolish choice
   is a part of their torment, when their heart shall return upon them and
   say, This was because thou wouldst look after temporal things; when
   snares, and brimstone, and a horrible tempest is poured out upon them.
   What thoughts have they of their portion when they are cast out with
   the devil and damned spirits! Carnal men think the difference between
   them and others will ever hold out when they glitter in the world. Oh,
   but the time is coming when death will undeceive them! And at the day
   of judgment they will be sensible of it, when they shall be refused as
   the outcasts of the world, and when the saints shall have their
   portion, when the Lord shall take the godly to himself, receive them
   into his bosom, and welcome them to heaven, and call them to his right
   hand; and they shall be banished out of his presence with a Go, ye
   cursed;' when they shall become the loathing of God, the scorn of
   angels and blessed spirits; when it shall be said, as in Ps. lii. 7,
   Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, but trusted in. the
   abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.'
   Oh, then, how will conscience return upon the wretchedness and folly of
   their hearts, and be exercised upon it! This will vex and gall them in
   hell, with anxious thoughts of it to all eternity. As by the fire that
   never shall be quenched is signified the wrath of God, so by the worm
   that never dies the violent working of conscience upon the folly of
   choosing perishing vanities.

   Use 2. It exhorts us to this necessary duty, to choose God for our
   portion. It is not a slight thing, but that upon which your eternal
   happiness doth depend; it is the fundamental article of the covenant of
   grace: and the question God puts you to is, whether you will choose him
   for your portion? therefore he begins the commandments with this, Thou
   shalt have no other gods before me.' God is not your God unless he be
   set uppermost in your souls; he cannot be your portion unless he be
   your chiefest good. There is no possibility of entering into covenant
   with God unless you subscribe to this main article. Again, as it is a
   very necessary work, so it is an evidence and fruit of God's election;
   if a man would come to know the thoughts of God concerning him before
   all the world, what his destiny is. God's election or choosing of you
   is manifested by your election or your choosing of God, for all God's
   works leave an impression upon the creature. He chooseth us that we
   might choose him: I will say, You are my people, and you shall say, I
   am your God.' Again, you must have something for your portion. There is
   no man hath a sufficiency in himself. The soul is like a sponge, always
   thirsting, and seeking of something from without to be filled--a chaos
   of desires. Man was made to live in dependence. Now, of all portions in
   the world, there is none worth the having but God himself; nothing else
   can make you completely blessed, and satisfy all the necessities and
   all the capacities of soul and body. When you have outward things, what
   have you for your conscience? If these things could fill up your
   affections, they bear no proportion with conscience; your sore will run
   upon you, and your inward griefs will not be cured. But this is such a
   portion, that besides internal grace, there shall be a competent
   measure of outward things. God will provide for you: Ps. xxiii. 1, The
   Lord is my shepherd.' What then? I shall not want.' This interest will
   give you temporal things and the comforts of this life, so that you
   have the fountain of all other mercies. While others do but drink of
   the streams, and of streams where they are muddy, where they partake of
   the soil through which they run, you go to the clear fountain. Alas!
   others do but pluck the leaves and flowers, but you have the fruits and
   very root itself, the perpetual fountain and well-spring of comfort,
   and root of all the blessedness the heart can wish for. Again, all
   other comforts grow upon this interest, and when all other things are
   lost, this can supply you again. All worldly things, when we have them,
   yet they have not a root; but you have the root, so that when other
   things fail, this will yield you all manner of supplies. Yea, this is
   that which seasons and makes all other things comfortable, when we have
   them and the love of God with them. This man of God had a kingdom and a
   great deal of wealth; he was a victorious king, as we may see by his
   offering, 1 Chron. xxix., what cart-loads of gold and silver he offers
   to God: yet in the midst of all this fulness he saith, Thou art my
   portion.' Other portions may turn to a man's hurt, as they are
   occasions of sin, as they expose to envy and danger. Many a man is
   undone both here and hereafter by making the creature his portion; but
   never any man was undone by making God his portion. It was the end of
   our creation. God, passing by all other creatures, set his heart upon
   man. He made all things for man, and man for himself. All other things
   were either subject to our dominion, or created for our use; but man
   was made immediately for God, for the enjoyment of God; made for
   himself, and for none else besides himself. We should have no rest in
   ourselves until we come to the enjoyment of God. God was not refreshed
   from his work, he rested not until he made man; therefore man should
   not rest until he comes to God. God takes us for his portion, and
   therefore you should take God for your portion: Deut. xxxii. 9, For the
   Lord's portion is his people;' Zech. ii. 12, And the Lord shall inherit
   Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.'
   If God shall choose a company of men to be his portion, certainly it
   becomes them again to choose him. God is willing to communicate his
   goodness, therefore why should we be satisfied with other things? He
   reasons with us, is angry that we will run to other things. Why will
   you lay out your time and strength in that which will not satisfy you?
   Isa. lv. 2. He doth invite you to come and choose him. He complains,
   and takes it grievously when he offers himself in the gospel: Ps.
   lxxxi. 11, Israel would none of me.' Oh! shall the God that made us
   thus passionately offer himself to us, and shall he be refused? Let
   this persuade you to choose God for your portion.

   Use 3. For trial. Have you chosen God for your portion? This will be
   seen--

   1. By your endeavours to get anything of God into your hearts. No man
   seeketh after God; there is the great complaint. If you did choose God,
   you would pursue all ways and means that you might gain him, and count
   all things but dung for Christ, as the apostle doth; then nothing would
   detain you from him, you would not be satisfied: Oh! I must have God;
   and God would be followed after: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven
   but thee?'

   2. By your prayers. What do you pray for? When you come to God, what do
   your hearts run upon? what do you seek for from God? Is it God himself?
   To seek to God and not for God is but a carnal design upon God: Hosea
   vii. 14, They howl upon their beds for corn, and wine, and oil.' They
   are but brutish desires, that terminate in other things, that are
   carried out more after them than God's favour and grace; therefore his
   favour must be sought in the first place.

   3. By your behaviour under trouble when other things fail: Lam. iii.
   24, The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore I will hope in
   him.' When they were driven from their other portions (for that is
   spoken of), when all manner of calamities did befall them, and they
   were cast out, and their inheritance turned to strangers, then, Lord,
   thou art our portion.' When you have nothing left but God, can you live
   upon God? and can he be all in all to you? 1 Sam. xxx. 6, David
   encouraged himself in the Lord his God.' When the Amalekites carried
   away all, yet this was his comfort, God was left still. And so Hab.
   iii. 18, When the labour of the olive shall fail,' &c. What then? Then
   I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.' When you can count yourself
   happy enough in God, Deus meus et omnia--if I have God, I have all;
   then you have chosen God for your portion.

   4. By your delight in God: Ps. xxxvii. 4, Delight thyself in the Lord,
   and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.' When this is the
   great rejoicing of your souls, that you can get but one beam of God's
   love and his favour darted upon your consciences, this is that which
   revives more than all other temporal things whatever.

   5. In mourning for his absence; if your God be gone, that is the grief
   of your souls. God can supply the want of the creature, but no creature
   can supply the want of God; therefore it is ground of trouble if he
   hide his face. This lamenting and mourning after a withdrawn God is
   frequently spoken of in scripture. But the great evidence lies in the
   words, Thou art my portion, Lord!' What then? I have said, that I would
   keep thy words.' Hence observe--

   Doct. 2. Those which have chosen God for their portion will manifest it
   by a fixed resolution and strict care of obedience.

   They are loath to break with God, rather break with anything else. It
   must needs be so, because--

   1. Holiness is a means of maintaining communion between us and God, and
   keeping up an interest in him as our only happiness: 1 John i. 6, 7, If
   we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with
   another: but if we walk in darkness, and say we have fellowship with
   him, we lie, and do not the truth.' Unless there be a care to please
   him, certainly you do not choose him for your portion; for if all your
   comfort and happiness lies in God, all your diligence and care Will be
   to please God. God was the portion of the Levites, it is said, because
   they ministered before him, Num. xviii. 20. So it is true of the
   spiritual Levites, they that are careful to walk with God, minis ter
   before him, and keep close with him; God will be their portion. All
   sincere Christians are purified as the sons of Levi.

   2. Because this is the only evidence. They that love God will love his
   word, and if they love it they will live by it, and square their
   actions accordingly. By careless walking you blot your evidences, and
   so weaken your comfort.

   3. Because God is your portion, therefore it should encourage us to
   keep his word: Gen. xvii. 1, I am God all-sufficient; walk before me
   and be thou perfect.' If we have an all-sufficient portion, all our
   business should be to keep in with God. All warping comes from doubting
   of God's all-sufficiency, as if God alone were not enough for us.
   Carnal fear, love, hope, doth draw us off from God to the creature, we
   are afraid to lose worldly enjoyments, so break with God. Therefore, if
   we look upon God as all-sufficient, it will necessarily follow we
   should encourage ourselves to serve him.

   4. If we do not keep his word, our lusts will carry us forth else
   where. There are certain corrupt principles within you will draw you
   off from God to another portion: Ezek. xiv. 5, They are all estranged
   from me through their idols.' What kind of idols were these? Idols of
   wood and stone? No; the prophet explains them, They have set up their
   idols in their heart,' ver. 3. Christians, a man may be an, idolater in
   opinion, and grossly, when he worships stocks and stones; and he may be
   an idolater spiritually and in practice. And which is most incurable of
   these two, think you? Certainly the spiritual idolater. A man may
   easily be convinced of his false worship by reason and argument, what a
   brutish thing it is to worship stocks and stones, things that have no
   life, nor can help him; but he cannot be convinced of his spiritual
   idolatry, or cured of that but by grace. Covetousness is idolatry,
   because it draws off our love, fear, trust, from God and his service,
   to riches, and so proves a snare to the soul. Idolatry in our
   affections is more dangerous than gross idolatry in our opinions and
   outward worship, when our affections carry us out to another good.

   5. Again, out of gratitude, when God doth all for us, can we deny him
   anything? Dost thou love God as the chiefest good, and wilt not thou
   fear to offend him? Whoever chooseth God for his portion will have
   David's disposition, I have said I will keep thy words;' he will be
   exact and punctual to keep in with God.

SERMON LXV.

   I entreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
   according to thy word.--Ver. 58.

   IN the former verse I took notice of two parts--David's protestation,
   Thou art my portion:' and his resolution, I will keep thy words.' To
   either of the branches this verse may be supposed to have respect. To
   the former thus, as a second evidence: if we make God our portion, this
   will necessarily follow, we shall desire his favour above all things
   else. Our portion is that good which we choose, renouncing all things
   else; therefore, when our hearts are set upon it, Whom have I in heaven
   but thee?' Ps. lxxiii. 25. When you entreat his favour with your whole
   heart, that is the evidence God is your portion. Or you may refer it to
   the latter clause thus, I said I will keep thy words,' therefore I
   entreat thy favour. We cannot carry on a good purpose without God's
   favour, unless he assist us therein. When we are most resolved, we must
   expect opposition and assaults both from within and without. The devil
   will seek all he can to oppose you, and to shake your resolutions, and
   your lusts will rage anew upon a severe restraint. Therefore those that
   resolve to enter into a strict course must seek relief from God's
   favour and mercy, as David here, I entreated thy favour with my whole
   heart.' In the words we have an account of David's practice upon a
   choice and resolution; he betook himself to prayer.

   Here you have--

   1. The object or principal thing sought, God's favour.

   2. The manner, with my whole heart, with a sincere affection. He doth
   not say, with his lips only, but his heart; and not with his heart
   only, but with his whole heart.

   3. The sum of his request, or the fountain of all that he expected from
   God, be merciful to me.

   4. The rule or ground of his expectation, according to thy word. The
   meaning is, that God, according to his promise, would graciously help
   him.

   First, For the first, I entreated thy favour;' or, as it is in the
   Hebrew, I painfully sought thy face;' meaning that he did with
   importunate and humble suit beg the smile of God's countenance. By face
   is meant favour: Prov. xxix. 26, many seek the ruler's favour;' it is,
   the ruler's face, that he may look cheerfully upon them: and I
   painfully sought, so the word signifies; it notes such importunity as
   is necessary for so great a blessing. The note is this--

   Doct. God's people, those that have made him their portion, they
   earnestly and constantly, above all things, desire his favour.

   1. This God calls for: Ps. cv. 4, Seek the Lord, seek his face ever
   more.' None have such communion with God but they need seek more: Ps.
   xxvii. 8, Thou saidst, Seek my face; thy face, Lord, will I seek.' Thou
   saidst:' it is that which God speaks in all his ordinances; the whole
   drift of the word is to press us to get and keep the sense of God's
   love ever fresh in our hearts.

   2. The nature of the saints carries them to it. This is the difference
   between them and carnal men, Ps. iv. 6, 7. The light of his countenance
   is spoken of either with allusion to the sun, whose light displayed
   cheers the plants; or with allusion to the smiles of a friend. One good
   look from God the children of God prefer above all the world. All
   earthly things cannot please them so much as a smile from God, nor put
   such gladness in their hearts. But more especially do they seek it most
   painfully--

   [1.] When they have never as yet attained any sense of it, but lie
   under doubts, fears, and anxious uncertainty; then, if God will but
   look upon them, make out his love to their consciences, what a comfort
   will that be to them! A man may want assurance and have grace, but he
   cannot slight assurance and have grace. He that is without it may be
   one of God's children, but he that doth not look after it, and is
   satisfied without it, certainly is none of that number. Therefore this
   is the desire and earnest prayer of all God's people in common, that
   God would cause his face to shine upon them: Ps. lxxx. 1, Thou that
   dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth;' that is, that sittest
   upon the mercy-seat. Oh, that he would be good to them in Christ! for
   between the cherubims there was the mercy-seat, where God sat. The
   meaning is, that he would a little dart in beams of comfort to their
   consciences.

   [2.] They thus painfully entreat the favour of God when they have lost
   it by sin; for then they are afflicted with a double evil--want of so
   great a comfort, and a sense of their own folly. A sense of God's
   favour may be withheld out of mere sovereignty, yet even then God's
   children will be earnest; but when it is withdrawn out of justice, as a
   correction for our folly and careless walking, there is greater cause
   of earnestness, that we may redeem and recover our loss again; then we
   are to be more earnest: Turn us again, Lord God of hosts, and cause
   thine anger towards us to cease,' Ps. lxxx. 7. By their former
   experience they know the sweetness of God's favour, and by their
   present loss the bitterness of the want of it. Basil hath a notable
   comparison. He saith, if an object be too bright, it must be set at a
   distance from the eye that we may see better; so worldly things must be
   set at a distance from us: therefore God seems to be at a distance,
   hides his face, that his people might know by the loss and want of it
   how to value their blessings.

   How far do they discover their earnestness?

   (1.) In that they seek it above all other things--above corn, wine, and
   oil. This is not their painful desire to be made great, rich, high,
   honourable, happy in the world. All the world doth them no good without
   the favour of God. As all the stars, though they shine together, do not
   dispel the darkness of the night, so no creatures can comfort us
   sufficiently when God hides his face from them: Ps. xxx. 1, Thou didst
   hide thy face and I was troubled.' They cannot find God as they were
   wont. As at funeral feasts, dear friends have little comfort when they
   miss their old friend that was wont to bid them welcome at the house;
   so when God is gone, what comfort can they take in their portion? Many
   will say, Why are you pensive and sad? you have a great many friends, a
   great estate! Oh! you do not know the wound of a gracious heart, and
   how little these things are in comparison of the favour of God!

   (2.) They manifest it in this, their contentedness with him, though
   they are kept low and bare in outward things: Ps. xvii. 15, As for me,
   I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I
   awake, with thy likeness.' It is enough for them to have the face of
   God, though they do not flourish in worldly plenty as others do, when
   in the exercise of grace they can find God propitious, behold his face
   in righteousness.' If they have not the candle they have the sun. If
   they go to God, they are welcome upon all occasions. If the world frown
   upon them, God doth not so: they are beloved of him, and in favour with
   him, and that satisfieth them.

   What may be the reasons why the children of God so prize his favour?

   (1st.) The worth of the thing itself: Ps. lxiii. 3, Thy favour is
   better than life,' better than all comforts, better in itself, for this
   is that which we are never weary of. A man may be weary of all out ward
   comforts: Days may come wherein there is no pleasure,' Eccles. xii. 1;
   At that time the soul abhors dainty food,' Job xxxiii. 20. Pleasure,
   nay, life itself, may be a burden, but none ever was weary of the love
   of God, that cannot be a bur*den; this doth not satiate and cloy us.
   Again, the love of God cannot be supplied and recompensed by other
   things: when a man loseth other things it may be made up in better. If
   a man be poor in this world, God hath chosen him to be rich in faith;
   if afflicted and destitute of outward provisions, yet they have inward
   comforts and graces, and they will supply and make up this loss. But
   the loss of God's favour cannot be supplied; when that departs from
   you, and a man loseth the hope he seemeth to have, what a sorry comfort
   is it, having forfeited the love of God, to seek our amends in the
   creature! Then this is more durable than the present life. Other
   comforts fail, but the love of God never fails. This is the original of
   all other comforts: Ps. xxx. 7, By thy favour thou hast made my
   mountain to stand strong;' and Ps. xliv. 3, Their own arm did not save
   them, but the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour
   unto them.' Sure it is better to drink of the fountain than of the
   stream: all is from the favour of God. In short, it is the vitality and
   the cause of life, and the cause of all comfort. This is better than
   life.

   (2d.) They are affected with that which is their true misery, therefore
   they most importunately beg the favour of God. Every man prays
   according to the sense that he hath, according to that which he counts
   his misery. He that hath a sense of no other calamity but to be poor,
   scorned, or exposed to contempt, or the absence of the creature, prays
   accordingly. Sometimes he howls like a dog in pain, or beasts that want
   food, Hosea vii. 14. But he that hath a deeper sense of his greatest
   necessities, he is affected with sin. which is the cause of all
   trouble; therefore he must have the favour of God and the grace of God.
   A godly and a carnal man differ as a child and a man in their
   apprehensions about pain and trouble. A child that is sick and would be
   eased of its present smart and pain, looks to nothing but that; but an
   understanding man knows the cause must be taken away. A child speaks
   according to the sense and apprehension it hath--take away his aching
   head or burning heat; but the understanding man looks not only after
   present ease, but health, that the root of the distemper may be
   removed. So a worldly man would have affliction gone, and looks no
   further, but a godly man hath a deeper sense, he must have the favour
   of God; therefore his heart works painfully within him till this be
   obtained.

   (3d.) They entreat the favour of God with all their hearts, because
   their business lies mainly with God. Their work is to walk closely with
   God, and keep up a strict communion with him. A carnal man's business
   lies with God sometimes in his trouble; but when he licks himself whole
   and is at ease, he can live without it. But a godly man's business is
   always with God, for God is always with him, in trouble and out of
   trouble. Therefore that is a notable speech, Ps. xci. 9, Because thou
   hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy
   habitation:' a refuge, that is a place of retreat in time of war; a
   habitation, there is our residence in time of peace, when every one
   sits under his own vine and fig-tree. Now, a godly man makes God not
   only his refuge but his habitation; therefore it concerns him to prize
   the favour of God, and keep in with him, for he is otherwise at an
   utter loss; therefore he must study to get all clear: if God be angry
   with him, his business is at a stand, and he cannot walk cheer fully
   with him from whom he expects all.

   Use 1. To reprove those that are indifferent whether they enjoy God's
   favour, yea or nay; so they may enjoy the creature they are satisfied.
   Surely God is not these men's portion, for their only care is what they
   shall eat, how they may be clothed, how to live well in the world; but
   were never acquainted with this kind of trouble about God's favour: Ps.
   x. 4, it is said, The wicked through the pride of his countenance will
   not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.' He never troubles
   himself how to keep in with God; it never goes to his heart. He is such
   an one as can bring to pass whatever he projecteth and desireth,
   without troubling himself with the fetters of religion and the care of
   a strict duty: he can live at large, and yet obtain his heart's desire,
   and thinketh them the only wise men, fit for his imitation, that can
   increase in worldly enjoyments without troubling themselves with such
   niceties as perplex others: he scorneth to trouble himself with prayer,
   and the observances which are necessary to waiting upon God. Again, it
   reproves those that lie stupid and senseless under God's active
   displeasure. These are not as gross as the former, but make some
   profession of respect to God, but have not yet a tender sense of God's
   accesses and recesses, his comings and goings. When the Lord hides
   himself from their prayers, and doth not give out the wonted influences
   of his grace and comfort, they mind it not, do not with earnestness
   seek to recover it again. If you did make this your business without
   interruption, when you have not the smiles of God, the want of this
   would create pain.

   Use 2. Of exhortation, to press us, if we would have God for our God,
   then to seek his favour above all things. Wait with an affectionate
   earnestness in every ordinance for some new discovery, some comfortable
   intimation of God's word: Ps. cxxx. 6, My soul waiteth for thee.' What?
   for outward deliverances? No; but I wait for the Lord, and in his word
   do I hope.' Again, in every enjoyment it is not enough to have the
   creature with God's leave (so can all men have it, it is their
   portion), but you must have it with God's love, as a token from God,
   wrapt up in the bowels of Christ. God gives many gifts to wicked men,
   but doth not give them his love. This we should look after, that we may
   find our comforts to be sprinkled with love, that if God deliver you
   out of any strait, he may love you out of it, Isa. xxxviii. 17.

   Secondly, For the manner, I have sought thy favour.' How? With my whole
   heart.' Note--

   Doct. When we pray for the favour of God, it must be with our whole
   heart.

   There is this intended in it--

   1. The constant favour and presence of God, we must pray for it, for
   without prayer faith lies idle, Heb. iv. 16.

   2. They that pray for it, their hearts must be set upon what they pray.
   It is not enough that our tongues babble out a cold form, as many learn
   to pray as parrots speak, by rote. They say, not pray a prayer: James
   v. 17, Elias prayed earnestly:' in the margin, and so in the original,
   he prayed in prayer.' A man may take up words of course, and say things
   after others, which are not indeed the real desires of his heart; so
   they pray as if they prayed not, slightly, without any warmth and
   affection.

   3. It is not enough that our hearts concur, but our whole hearts must
   go along with this work. Many times we pray but with half a heart:--

   [1.] Partly when prayer is a fruit of memory and invention, but not the
   fruit of conscience. Common illumination will tell us how prayer is to
   be formed according to the tenor of the Christian faith; so men may
   repeat words such as the understanding judgeth fit, without any
   answerable touch upon the heart. This is their sin who are more careful
   about notions in prayer than the affections.

   [2.] A man prays but with a piece of his heart when he prays rather
   with his conscience than with his affections. Will you distinguish
   this, a dictate of conscience must be distinguished from a purpose of
   heart. Conscience may tell us what is to be done, yet the heart have no
   liking to it. Austin saith when he was a carnal man he had some kind of
   conscience, and prayed against his sins; but, saith he, I was afraid
   God would hear me. The favour of God is necessary, but the heart many
   times is not engaged in the pursuit of it. We oftener pray from our
   memories than our consciences, and oftener from our consciences than
   our affections; the heart is not put into the duty.

   [3.] When our affections are divided to carnal things, and the
   comfortable part of spiritual things. No doubt there is no man but
   would have the favour of God, but it is with a condition that he may
   live as he does, and be as he is, and so the prevailing part of his
   soul bends him to his present course; he regards iniquity in his heart,
   and sin hath an interest and lies very near; he would have the favour
   of God abstractedly, but when he considers how his lusts must be parted
   with, there his heart is divided.

   Use. Oh! then, look to it that you beg the Lord's favour with all your
   heart. God knows the heart. Rebekah dressed up Jacob so that his father
   mistook him. Ay! but God cannot mistake; his eye is not dim as Isaac's,
   he sees the heart; therefore let your heart, and whole heart, go out in
   the pursuit.

   Quest. How shall we know when our hearts are thus thoroughly bent, if
   you seek him with all your hearts?

   Ans. Then you will observe how you speed when you look after him; you
   will see what becomes of your requests. I will hearken what God will
   speak,' saith David, and will pray and look up;' as Elijah looked up to
   see the cloud a-coming. Again, if we pray with the whole heart there
   will be importunate arguings; desire will take no nay: Ps. lxiii. 8, My
   soul followeth hard after thee.' Oh! it will be a painful, grievous
   thing to your souls if you do not speed in your prayers. Not a slight
   motion, or cold wish, but such as deeply affects the heart, and not
   easily put off and satisfied with other things. Wicked men would have
   the favour of God, but they are easily put out of the humour. Again,
   then we pray with the whole heart when there is such a desire as not to
   be discouraged, but you venture again, when the Lord seems to put off
   and give a check to your requests: Isa. xxvi. 8, The desire of our soul
   is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.' Still desires grow
   hotter and hotter, and when there is a kind of impudence not to be put
   off. Again, such as do excite endeavours for the obtaining of God's
   love and a sense of his favour. It will cost us pain and trouble when
   we are hard at work, and will be diligent in this thing. But when you
   rest in a few cold prayers, you are never hearty with God: Ps. xxvii.
   4, One thing have I desired.' What then? That will I seek after,' and
   use a great deal of diligence to come by it.

   Thirdly, The fountain of all that we expect is mercy. All that seek
   God's favour must expect it upon terms of grace: Be merciful unto me.'
   We cannot say, Pay me what thou owest, or, Give me for my money. All
   whom God accepts to his grace and favour are unworthy: Isa. lv. 1, Ho,
   every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no
   money; come ye, buy and eat, come, buy wine and milk, without money,
   and without price.' Secondly, They who are received to favour still
   need mercy to pardon failings, Gal. v. The best are but sanctified in
   part, and have the dregs of corruption always remaining, and frequently
   stirring in them.

   Use. Let us thus deal with God: Hosea xiv. 2, Take with you words, and
   turn to the Lord; say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us
   graciously.' The sum of all our requests is, that God would be merciful
   to us.

   Fourthly, The rule and ground of confidence is according to thy word.'
   God's word is the rule of our confidence, for therein is God's stated
   course. If we would have favour from God and mercy, it must be upon his
   own terms. God will accept of us in Christ, if we repent, believe, and
   obey, and seek his favour diligently: he will not deny those who seek,
   ask, knock. We would have mercy, but will not observe God's directions.
   We must ask according to God's will, not without a promise, nor against
   a command. God is made a voluntary debtor by his promise. These are
   notable props of faith, when we are encouraged to seek by the offer, to
   apply by the promise. We thrive no more in a comfortable sense of God's
   love, because we take not this course.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXVI.

   I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.--Ver.
   59.

   IN these words we have--

   1. David's exercise, I thought on my ways.

   2. The effect of it, I turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

   In the former verse he beggeth mercy and the favour of God. Now those
   that beg mercy must be in a capacity to receive mercy. God is ready to
   show mercy, but to whom? To the penitent, that humbly seek it, and turn
   from the evil of their ways. We cannot expect God should be favourable
   to us while we continue in a course of sin. Therefore David showeth
   that he entreated God's mercy and favour upon God's terms, that he was
   one of those converted by grace: I thought on my ways,' &c. Some copies
   of the Septuagint have it ta`s o'dous sou dielogisa'men, I considered
   thy ways,' much to the same purpose; for a serious consideration of the
   excellency of God's ways is of use, as well as of the naughtiness of
   our own. But other copies read better, according to the original
   Hebrew, I thought on my ways,' our omissions, commissions, purposes,
   practices, the course of our thoughts, words, deeds.

   In the other part, when we are said to turn our feet unto God's
   testimonies, it is meant of the conversion of the whole soul, evidenced
   by the course of our feet or practices. So Eccles. v. 1, Keep thy feet
   when thou goest into the house of God:' the meaning is, look to thy
   heart and affections. We are sometimes said to turn to God, and.
   sometimes to the testimonies or commands of God. We turn to God as the
   object or last end; to his testimonies as the rule of our conversation
   to lead us thither. So that by it is meant an effectual conversion of
   the whole man, to walk according to the rule of God's word.

   The text issueth itself into this one point:--

   Doct. That serious consideration of our own ways maketh way for sound
   conversion to God.

   In the managing of this doctrine I shall discuss two things:--

   1. The necessity of serious consideration in order to repentance.

   2. How much it concerneth us after we have considered effectually to
   turn to the Lord.

   First, The necessity of serious consideration in order to repentance.
   And there--

   1. What is consideration.

   2. The objects of it, or the things that must be considered.

   3. I shall argue the necessity of this.

   First, What is this consideration or thinking upon our ways? In the
   general, it is a returning upon our hearts, or a serious and anxious
   debating with ourselves concerning our eternal condition. For the
   understanding whereof, consider that a carnal man is mindless and
   altogether careless of his eternal interests, like a fool or madman, or
   one out of his wits. We were sometimes foolish,' ano'etoi. Titus iii.
   3, like men asleep or distracted; they do not know what they are doing,
   nor what will be the issue of things, till God awaken their hearts to
   think of their condition, and then they begin to act like men again,
   and to be sensible of their case. Thus it is said of the prodigal, Luke
   xv. 17, eis heauton elthon, that he came to himself;' as a man when he
   is drunk, we say he is not himself, he doth not consider what he doth,
   nor consider the danger of his actions. And the Psalmist, speaking of
   the conversion of the Gentiles, saith, Ps. xxii. 27, The ends of the
   earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord;' that is, shall recollect
   themselves, and consider of the end of their lives, whence they are,
   whither they are going, and what shall become of them to all eternity,
   as if all this while they had forgotten the purpose for which they were
   sent into the world, who was their master, what was their business.
   Alas! before this serious consideration, men in seeing see not, and in
   hearing hear not, as a man that is musing of another matter is not
   affected with what you tell him; he heareth and doth not hear. It is
   the awakening of the heart which is God's first work, before he giveth
   other grace: Eph. v. 14, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
   dead, and Christ shall give thee light.' First awake, and then arise
   from the dead, before which men have but such languid notions of God
   and Christ and salvation by him as men have in a dream; but when we
   come to weigh and scan things with affection and application, then the
   soul is awakened.

   Now God bringeth us to this--

   1. Partly by his word, which showeth our natural face, James i. 23, 24,
   or natural estate and condition before God. It is appointed for this
   purpose, to be the instrument to awaken men, to discover them to
   themselves. Now, because this may make but a weak impression, such as
   may soon be blotted out, andri` paraku'psanti, they forget and fall
   asleep again; therefore to this God joineth his rod. Therefore--

   2. Partly by afflictions; as the prodigal, when he was reduced to husks
   and rags, then he came to himself and was brought to his right mind.
   Again, 1 Kings viii. 47, If in the land of their affliction they shall
   bethink themselves and repent;' the Hebrew is, bring it back to their
   hearts.' Affliction is sanctified to this end, to open the eyes; it
   bringeth us to ourselves. So Haggai, i. 5, 7, Now consider your ways,'
   now Thesthe tas kardias epi` tas hodous humon, lay your hearts upon
   your ways;' when they sowed much and brought in little, and what they
   earned was put into a bag with holes; that is, when the hand of God was
   upon them, and the visible curse of his providence. When the word of
   God doth not effectually discover men to themselves, then he sends
   afflictions to put them upon a search, and by his rod whippeth them out
   of their sleepy dreams and carnal security.

   3. By his Spirit; and the first effect of his operations is
   compunction: Acts ii. 37, When they heard this they were pricked in
   heart, and cried out, Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?'
   It makes them anxious and solicitous. I ascribe this work to the
   Spirit, because it was a time when the Spirit was newly poured forth.
   Well then, in the general, it is God's awakening the heart to a serious
   and anxious debate with itself concerning its eternal condition, before
   which we go on sleepily in a course of sin; but then the soul crieth
   out, What have I done, and what shall I do? how carelessly have I
   lived! and what shall become of me to all eternity?

   More particularly, this thinking upon our ways involveth in its full
   latitude three grand duties:--

   1. As it relateth to our past estate, or the ways wherein we have
   walked, self-examining, or a serious searching and inquiring in what
   condition we are before God. This is necessary to conversion and
   turning to the Lord: Lam. iii. 40, Let us search and try our ways, and
   turn unto the Lord.' There needeth a serious calling ourselves to an
   account, or a strict view and survey of our former courses, if we would
   amend what is amiss in them; and still, as we renew our repentance,
   this course must we take.

   2. As it relateth to present actions, or the ways wherein we are to
   walk, so it implieth prudent consideration before we do anything; let
   us see our warrant, that we may do nothing but what is agreeable to
   God's word: Prov. iv. 26, 27, Ponder the paths of thy feet, and let all
   thy ways be established: turn not to the right hand or to the left;
   remove thy foot from evil.' We have a narrow line to walk by, but a
   foot of ground to go upon; and therefore we should not walk at hap
   hazard, but with much exactness: Eph. v. 15, See that ye walk
   circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise;' therefore we need to weigh
   all our actions in the balance of the sanctuary, that if anything
   displease God we may avoid it The conscience of our weakness, and the
   strictness of our rule, should make us take the better heed to
   ourselves.

   3. With respect to the tendency and issues of things; and so it noteth
   fore-consideration or deliberation in order to choice. God biddeth his
   people stand upon the ways and see, and inquire after the old paths,
   which is the good way, and walk therein,' Jer. vi. 16; as travellers,
   when they are at a loss or in doubt of their way, seeing divers paths
   before them, are careful to inform themselves aright that they may take
   the next, readiest, and best way for their journey's end. An awakened
   conscience is like Hercules, in bivio; there are two ways present
   themselves--the way of sin and flesh-pleasing, and the way of God's
   commandments; or, as it is Mat. vii. 13, 14, the broad way,' and the
   narrow way.' The broad way of sin seemeth pleasant and enticing, but it
   leadeth to death; the narrow way is rough and craggy, troublesome to
   flesh and blood, but the end is life and peace. Now the soul debateth
   upon the choice which of these is better, by weighing the loss and gain
   on either side, and the final issue and tendency of both these ways; or
   rather, the awakened soul is in the case of a man that is yet to
   choose; or like a man that is out of the way, and wants his usual
   marks. He bethinketh himself, If I go on in this broad beaten road of
   corruption, I am sure to go down to the chambers of death, and perish
   evermore. Oh! but let me make a stop; it is better to take God's
   direction than the way of mine own heart; it is a way that will undo me
   for ever. Hitherto I have gone awry; how shall I do to get into the
   right way? I would be happy, and this course will never make me so;
   surely it is better to take God's counsel than to please the flesh. No
   course will satisfy conscience, no course will make you happy, but a
   life led according to the word of God. Thus you see it implieth--

   1. An examination of our past course, or a looking into our own estate.

   2. A careful watch over future actions.

   3. A consideration of the issue and event of things. I have viewed my
   life past. I have been wrong, and I see it will be bitterness in the
   issue; therefore I purpose to give up myself to a course of obedience,
   and therefore to consider well of my actions for the future. Now this
   is a work that is not once to be done, but always. As often as we look
   to ourselves, we shall find something that needeth amendment; and
   therefore we need to press the heart with new and pregnant thoughts to
   mind our duty, and to use constant caution, and taking heed to our ways
   that we may not go wrong. Ps. xxxix. 1, thus did David, to keep his
   heart right, I thought on my ways.'

   Secondly, The objects of this consideration, or the things that must be
   considered; that may be gathered out of the former discourse. But--

   1. Who made thee? Eccles. xii. 1, Remember thy Creator in the days of
   thy youth.' It is a great advantage to call to mind whose creatures we
   are; for this will shame us, that we have done no more than we have
   done for him, from whom we have all that we have; and this in youth,
   when the effects of this creating bounty are most fresh upon our
   senses. In good earnest consider, who was it that made thee a
   reasonable creature; not a stone, and without life; nor a plant, and
   without sense; nor a beast, and without reason; but a man, with reason,
   and understanding, and will, and affections; that thou mayest know him,
   and love him, and enjoy him. And hast thou never thought of the God
   that made thee? Art thou of those hare-brained fools that go on rashly
   in a course of sin, and God is not in all their thoughts'? Ps. x. 4.
   How canst thou look upon the body without thoughts of him whose
   workmanship it is? or think of thy soul without thinking of God whose
   image and superscription it bears, and without whom thou canst not so
   much as think? Shall it be troublesome to thee to have frequent
   thoughts of God, when thou canst go musing of vanity all the day long?
   Shall every trifle find a room in thy heart, when God findeth no room
   there? He is not far from every one of us,' Acts xvii. 27, but we are
   far from him. He is before thee, behind thee, round about thee, yea,
   within thee, or else thou couldst not keep thy breath in thy body for a
   moment, and wilt thou not then take some time to season thy heart with
   thoughts of God? The first miscarriage of men came from this: Rom. i.
   28, They liked not to retain God in their knowledge.' Thoughts of God
   and right opinions of God were a burden to them, and therefore they
   gave up themselves to an ungodly course and evil state of mind. And
   wilt thou put such a scorn and contempt upon thy Creator as never
   seriously to think of him? yea, when thoughts of God rush in upon thy
   mind, to turn them out as unwelcome guests? This is to degenerate into
   the state of devils, a part of whose torment it is to think of God:
   they believe and tremble;' the more explicit thoughts they have of the
   name of God, the more is their horror increased. Oh! then let thy
   meditations of God be sweet and serious, Ps. civ. 34. Everything that
   passeth before thine eyes proclaims an invisible God, an infinite and
   eternal power, that made thee and all things else. Shall the heavens
   above, the earth beneath thee say, Remember God; and every creature,
   every pile of grass thou treadest upon, call to thee, Remember God; and
   wilt thou be so stupid and scornful as not to cast a look upon him?
   Then we begin to be serious when thoughts of God are more fastened upon
   our hearts.

   2. Why did he make thee? Not in vain; for no wise agent will make a
   thing to no purpose, especially with such advice, Let us make man.'
   Certainly not for a life of sin, to break his laws, and follow your
   lusts, and satisfy your fleshly desires. Was this God's end, that the
   creature might rebel against himself? This is not consistent with his
   goodness, to make us for such an end; or if so, why did he make the
   rules of justice and equity natural to us, so that man is a law to
   himself? Rom. ii. 14. Nor for sport and recreation, to eat, drink, and
   be merry, or to melt away your days in ease and idleness. He spake
   rather like a beast than a man, Soul, take thine ease, eat, drink, and
   be merry; thou hast goods laid up for many years,' Luke xii. 19. If
   merely for pleasures, why did he give us a conscience? The brute beasts
   are fitter for such a use, who have no conscience, and therefore no
   remorse to embitter their pleasures. What was the end for which God
   made us? Was it to gather wealth, and that the soul might cater for the
   body, and that we might live well here in the world? No; for then God's
   work would terminate in itself. And why were such noble faculties given
   us, such a high-flying reason, that hath a sense of another world, if
   this were all God's end, that we might grovel here upon earth, and
   scrape and heap up this world's riches? We see they are the basest of
   men who are given to this kind of pursuits. Surely this was not God's
   end. But why was it? Prov. xvi. 4, God hath made all things for
   himself,' for his glory; and so man to glorify him and enjoy him. The
   beasts were made to glorify him in their kind, but man to enjoy him.
   This is my end, to seek after God, to please him, to serve him: Ps.
   xiv. 2, The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
   see if there were any that did understand and seek God.' God, that hath
   fixed his end, observeth what man doth in compliance with it, what
   affection and care they have to find him, please him, glorify him.
   Reason will tell us as well as scripture that the first cause must be
   the last end, and we must end there where we began at first: 1 Cor. x.
   31, Whether, therefore, ye cat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
   the glory of God.' Well, then, I was not made for nothing, not to sin
   away my life, nor to sport it away, nor to talk it away, nor to drudge
   it away in the servile and basest offices of this life; my. end is to
   enjoy God, and my work and business is to serve and glorify him.

   3. How little you have answered this end! God complaineth of our
   backwardness to this work: Jer. viii. 6, No man repented of his
   wickedness, saying, What have I done?' God, upon a review, found every
   day's work good, very good in themselves, and their correspondence and
   frame, Gen. i. 31; but when we consider our ways, we shall find that
   all is evil, very evil. We have too long gone on in a course of sin,
   and the more we go on, the more we shall go astray, and wander from the
   great end for which we were created, which was God's service and
   honour. Oh! consider your ways, especially when conscience is set awork
   by the word, or when we smart under the folly of our own wanderings,
   and God maketh us sensible of our mistake by some smart scourge. If we
   never seriously thought on our ways before, then is a time to think of
   them, and to count it a mercy that we are not left to go on in a course
   of sin without checks and disappointments. Oh! look upon the drift and
   course of your lives and actions, pry into every corner of them. What
   have I been doing hitherto? spending my days in vanity and sin? Have I
   remembered my Creator, made it my work to serve him, my scope to
   glorify him? Have I looked after this as the unum necessarium, the
   great law and business of my life, that I might enjoy communion with
   God? Oh! for how long a time hath God been kept out of his right, and I
   have been sowing to the flesh, and never minded the great errand for
   which I was sent into the world! None can excuse himself.

   4. The unkindness and baseness of such a course, that you may make it
   odious to the soul. God hath not only made me, but kept me, and
   provided for me day after day. The God which fed me all my lifetime,'
   saith Jacob, Gen. xlviii. 15. I have been fed at his table, clothed at
   his cost, defended, kept, when long ago God might have struck me dead
   in my sins; and yet all this while I have not thought of God, to pay
   the return of my thanks and obedience to my great benefactor. The very
   beasts are more dutiful in their kind to man, who, as God's instrument,
   provideth for them: Isa. i. 3, The ox knows his owner, and the ass his
   master's crib; but my people will not know, Israel will not consider.'
   How senseless have I been of the great obligations wherein I stand
   bound to God! There is the fault; we do not know, and will not consider
   what hath been done to God for this.

   5. What it will come to, or what will become of you, if you should
   still so continue, or if I should go on in this course, what will be my
   portion for ever? Nothing but an eternal separation from God, and
   endless torments with the devil and his angels: Ps. l. 22, Now consider
   this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none
   to deliver.' Oh! this is the means to awaken the conscience, and to
   affect the heart with high and right thoughts of God. What will be the
   end of those that go far away from God, if they do not make haste to
   come home to him? Eternal and merciless vengeance; for God will not
   always bear with forgetful sinners; they shall be torn in pieces, the
   soul sent to hell, and the body to the grave. Oh! it concerneth the
   poor impenitent wretch that now goeth on fearless in a course of sin,
   immediately to stop in his march, lest he be hurried away to the place
   of torment, and there be no escaping. Now, urge this upon the heart,
   and exercise your thoughts in the remembrance of it; and if you have
   overcome and overwrestled some former qualms of conscience, now lay it
   to heart, and do so no more. It may be the hour is at hand when God
   will take away your souls from you, and all your sins shall be set in
   order before you, and the stupid conscience, that is now senseless,
   shall have a lively feeling of all your rebellions and unkindnesses
   done to God, as the paper which was but now white, when stamped with
   the printing-irons hath a story written upon it in legible characters.

   6. How much it concerneth you to come out of this condition speedily,
   for God is not a God to be neglected or dallied with. When he calls in
   the seasons of grace he will be observed, otherwise you may call and he
   will have no regard: They shall call, and I will not answer; they shall
   seek me early, but not find me,' Prov. i. 28. When you receive many
   checks of conscience, entreaties of grace, motions of the Spirit in
   vain, God will be gone. God doth commonly give men a day, and no man or
   angel knoweth how long this day shall last. God gave Cain a day: If
   thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted? if thou dost ill, sin lieth
   at the door.' Oh! then, when you begin to have thoughts of turning unto
   God, let them not be quelled. God reckoneth every hour, These three
   years,' this second epistle,' this second miracle:' and when his
   patience will expire you cannot tell.

   7. How happy it will be for you when once you change your course I The
   prodigal remembered the plenty in his father's house; you will find a
   manifest difference: Rom. vi. 21, 22, What fruit had you then in those
   things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is
   death: but now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
   ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.' In the
   way, no such gripes of conscience, no shame, sorrow, fears; in the end,
   everlasting life. It was your mistaking that called the days of sin
   good days. Oh! but when fruitful in holiness you will have present
   comfort and serenity of mind, a taste of the clusters of Canaan in the
   wilderness, hope of a glorious state, and the best will be at last.
   Compare pain with pain, pleasure with pleasure. We do not compare
   aright the pains of godliness with pleasures of sin; and yet there you
   may see the discharging of our duty will yield more true comfort and
   peace than all the pleasures of sin can bring us.

   8. What hopes by Christ: Heb. iii. 1, Wherefore, holy brethren,
   partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest
   of our profession, Jesus Christ:' what provision God hath made.

   Thirdly, Let me argue the necessity of this consideration.

   1. Otherwise men are rash, careless, and precipitant, and act as they
   are carried on by their own lusts; whereas, if they did consider, it
   would stop them in the course of sin. They rush like a horse into the
   battle, because no man saith, What have I done?' Jer. viii. 6. Men run
   on like a headstrong horse after their lusts and fancies; whereas, if
   they do seriously bethink themselves, and cast in a few grave thoughts
   about things to come, it would be like the putting in of cold water
   into a boiling pot, abate the fervour of their lusts. Men are wicked
   because they are inconsiderate; there are arguments enough against sin
   if they would but pause and weigh them seriously; but we do not think
   of heaven and hell, and therefore they do not work upon us: Eccles. xi.
   9, Remember that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment.'

   2. This serious consideration is a good means to awaken us from the
   sleep of security. When we consider the end why we were made, the rule
   we are to walk by, and poise ourselves about conformity or inconformity
   to this rule, and do withal revolve the issues of things in our minds,
   it cannot but rouse us up out of our sloth and stupidness, and make us
   act more vigorously and regularly as to the ends of our creation. Oh!
   what shall I do? The first grace is awakening; that maketh way for
   other graces; Eph. v. 14, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
   dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Whereas otherwise, when we
   consider not, we are stupid and sottish: Isa. xliv. 19 None considered!
   in his heart, Is there not a lie in my right hand? I have burnt part in
   the fire,' Eccles. v. 1, they offer the sacrifice of fools,' for they
   consider not that they have done evil:' they do not weigh their
   actions. The reason why they go wrong and continue wrong is, they do
   not seriously ponder and debate with themselves what it will come to.

   3. By consideration we come to find where the work of God sticketh with
   us, and so conviction being the more particular, worketh the more
   kindly. A blunt iron that toucheth many points doth not so soon go to
   the quick as a needle that toucheth but one point: Mal. iii. 7, Return,
   and they said, Wherein shall we return?' We do not see the need of
   repentance so much as by prying narrowly into our own ways. In short,
   without this, life is not so regular, the heart is not overpowered with
   such strong and full reason to comply with God's counsel.

   Secondly, How much it concerneth us, after we have considered our ways,
   to turn to the Lord, and diligently to pursue the course which he hath
   prescribed: I turned my feet unto thy testimonies.' A sound conversion
   is here described.

   1. I turned, in the thorough purpose of his heart, that is the act on
   our part. It is by God's grace that we are turned, but we turn our
   selves when the purpose of our souls is fixed: Turn me, and I shall be
   turned.' God inclineth the heart, and we manifest it by binding
   ourselves by a thorough purpose. A wish, an offer, when it endeth only
   in that, we have not considered enough; but when the heart is bent, I
   am turned. The prodigal, when he took up, came to himself, and had
   reasoned the case, says, I will go to my father,' Luke xv. 18. It must
   be such a purpose as is diligently pursued.

   2. The object or rule, my feet unto thy testimonies. By his feet is
   meant the course of his life. Our will and natural inclination should
   be no rule to us, but God's testimonies. We must entirely give up
   ourselves to the direction of his word: As many as walk according to
   this rule,' Gal. vi. 16. We are not to walk as we list. There is a
   fixed determinate rule, which must be kept with all accurateness and
   attention; a godly man is very tender of breaking this rule; he makes
   conscience of keeping to this rule.

   Now it concerneth us to make sure work of it.

   [1.] Because convictions lost occasion the greater hardness of heart.
   No iron so hard as that which has been often heated and often quenched;
   and no heart so bad as theirs that seemed to have some serious and
   anxious thoughts about their eternal condition. The devil is the more
   busy and watchful about them because of their offer to escape; and God
   is the more provoked because they started aside when they were at the
   point of yielding; as better a match were never proposed, than to break
   off just as it is ready to be concluded. Always according to the
   closeness of the application, if it succeed not, so doth our hardness
   of heart increase. They that were ministerially stirred, when they pull
   away the shoulder, their hearts grow like an adamant stone: Zech. vii.
   11, 12, But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
   stopped their ears that they should not hear; yea, they made their
   hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the
   words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his Spirit by the former
   prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts.' When
   the Spirit is in a way of striving, Gen vi. 3, when you are any way
   affected, if resistance be continued, he withdraws. When men blunt the
   edge of conscience, deaden their affections, they lose all feeling: 2
   Peter ii. 20, 21, For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the
   world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they
   are again entangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worse with
   them than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have
   known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn
   from the holy commandment delivered unto them.' They sin against former
   knowledge, experience, and sense of the truth. As their light is, so
   their resisting causeth hardness, and all the sensible work cometh to
   nothing. But that is not all, it turneth to loss; it maketh it more
   difficult than it was before in regard of us; it maketh us more
   careless. When we had some stirring in our consciences before, we
   healed it slightly, and we think to do so again.

   [2.] You will provoke God to use a rougher dispensation when the
   persuasions of the word and the strivings of the Spirit cannot bring
   you to repentance. They will not be won by arguments; God teacheth them
   by blows, as Gideon did the men of Succoth by briers and thorns.
   Therefore they shall shortly find themselves so involved in the fruit
   of their sins, as they shall not look off from it; their guilt shall
   lay hold of them at every hand: Hosea vii. 2, They consider not in
   their hearts that I remember all their sins; now their doings have
   beset them round about.' We should be much with our hearts, considering
   our case, how it is with us. God useth not the rod till forced to it:
   He doth not willingly grieve nor afflict the children of men,' Lam.
   iii. 33. When milder means work but half a cure, the rest is sup plied
   by some pressing judgments; his work is stopped, and therefore he
   promotes it this way.

   [3.] It is a sign your consideration is not serious when you are off
   and on, and it produceth no good effect in the soul. A plaster may be
   sovereign, but when you are still pulling it off and putting it on, it
   does no good. Light thoughts work not; when they are deep and
   ponderous, then they leave a durable impression. Still it is, Remember
   and turn:' Ps. xxii. 27, All the ends of the world shall remember and
   turn unto the Lord.' Bethink and repent: 1 Kings viii. 47, If they
   shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captives,
   and repent;' Search and try, and turn unto the Lord.' Some are semper
   victuri, always considering, about to live: but you must resolve:
   kindly convictions will not die, nor let the convinced sinner alone
   till they appear in the fruits of obedience.

   [4.] The devil hath his purposes: Mat. xiii. 19, The wicked one
   catcheth away that which was sown in his heart;' he watcheth troubled
   sinners, that the work may die away.

   Use 1. To reprove us--

   1. For not considering our ways. When did you ever go aside, and
   seriously debate with yourselves about your turning to God? Did you
   ever lay it to your hearts how matters stand between you and God? There
   are certain seasons when God calleth you to it, and that is--

   [1.] When the doctrine of life and the way of salvation hath been
   represented unto you with evidence and power, and you have felt some
   stirring and trouble in your consciences. Did you go home and say, Rom.
   viii. 31, What shall we then say to these things?' God hath spoken to
   me this day; now shall all this be lost and come to nothing? Heb. ii.
   3, How shall I escape if I neglect so great salvation?' Now I am called
   to mind Christ and salvation more. If I should give no heed to these
   things, or only give them the hearing for the present, oh! what will
   become of me? There is a special providence in every message, warning,
   offer, or instruction by the word. Acts xiii. 26, To you is this word
   of salvation sent;' he doth not say, We brought it, but, God sent it;
   as some message of God for your trial. Do we think of these things
   which we have heard and learned?

   [2.] When God appeareth against you in a course of judgments, cutting
   off one comfort after another, now taking away a child, then blasting
   the estate: Now consider your ways;' Eccles. vii. 14, In the day of
   adversity consider:' then is the duty in season. Affliction doth not
   rise out of the dust; God hath some end in these providences; and what
   is his end but to make me mindful of my duty to him? See for what end
   these things come, and to what issue they tend, that we may hear the
   rod, and know the meaning of the providence. If you do not consider,
   God will make you consider before he hath done with you. Jer. xxiii.
   20, The anger of the Lord shall not return till he hath performed all
   the thoughts of his heart, and then you shall consider it perfectly.'
   God will follow blow after blow till we do consider his mind and
   purpose. Jer. xxx. 24, The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return
   until he hath done it, and until he hath performed the intents of his
   heart.'

   2. To reprove us for not taking this advantage. When we are set
   a-thinking of our ways, we have many thoughts and sensible stirrings,
   but they come to nothing, because we do not follow it close. You think,
   and have some workings of conscience, but do they end in a fixed
   purpose? Some break through all, as Saul forces himself, 1 Sam. xiii.
   12. Break through all restraints of conscience. Felix had his qualm,
   but he puts it off to another season. Oh! consider these things will
   one day be a witness against you, the sensible workings upon your
   hearts by the word and rod.

   Use 2. To stir us up to this work, serious consideration in order to
   sound conversion.

   1. Be frequent in it. If daily you called yourselves to an account, all
   acts of grace would thrive the better. Seneca of Sextius, Quid hodie
   malum sanasti? cui vitio obstitisti? You have God's example in
   reviewing every day's work, and in dealing with Adam before he slept.
   The man that was unclean was to wash his clothes at eventide.

   2. Seriously set yourself to it: Deut. xxxii. 46, Set your hearts unto
   all the words which I testify among you this day.' It is a weighty
   matter of life and death: Ps. iv. 4, Commune with your hearts and be
   still.' This is the way to check sin, and to come on most hopefully in
   a course of obedience.

   3. Drive your thoughts to a resolution, to rectify whatever is amiss;
   never leave thinking of your ways till you grow anxious about eternal
   life, nor let your anxiousness cease till you bring it to somewhat;
   grow to some resolution about the ways of God. Pray God to make your
   consideration effectual: 2 Tim. ii. 7, Consider what I have said, and
   the Lord give you understanding in all things:' this is but the means,
   God giveth the grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXVII.

   I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.--Ver. 60.

   IN the verse immediately preceding the man of God speaks of repentance
   as the fruit of consideration and self-examining: I considered my ways,
   and then turned my feet to thy testimonies.' But when did he turn? For
   though we see the evil of our ways, we are naturally slow to get it
   redressed. Therefore David did not only turn to God, but he did it
   speedily. We have an account of that in this verse, I made haste,' &c.
   This readiness in the work of obedience is doubly
   expressed--affirmatively and negatively. Affirmatively, I made haste:'
   negatively, I delayed not.' This double expression increaseth the
   sense, according to the manner of the Hebrews; as Ps. cxviii. 17, I
   shall not die, but live,' that is, surely live; so here, I made haste,
   and delayed not,' that is, I verily delayed not a moment; as soon as he
   had thought of his ways, and taken up resolutions of walking closely
   with God, he did put it into practice. The Septuagint reads the words
   thus: I was ready, and was not troubled or diverted by fear of danger.
   Indeed, besides our natural slowness to good, this is one usual ground
   of delays, we distract ourselves with fears, and when God hath made
   known his will to us in many duties, we think of tarrying till the
   times are more quiet and favour our practice, and our affairs are in a
   better posture. A good improvement may be made of that translation; but
   the words run better, as they run more generally, with us, I made
   haste, and delayed not,' &c.; and from thence observe--

   Doct. That the call of God, whether to amendment and newness of life,
   or to any particular duty, must be without delay obeyed.

   To illustrate the point by these reasons:--

   Reas. 1. Ready obedience is a good evidence of a sound impression of
   grace left upon our hearts. There is a slighter conviction which
   breedeth a sense of duty, but doth not urge us thoroughly to the
   performance of it; and so men stand reasoning instead of running,
   debating the case with God: and there is a more sound conviction which
   is accompanied with a prevailing efficacy, and when we have this upon
   our spirits, then all excuses and delays are laid aside, and we come
   off readily and kindly in the way of compliance with God's call. This
   is doctrinally spoken of, Cant. i. 4, Draw me, and we will run after
   thee.' Running is an earnest and speedy motion. From whence comes it?
   From drawing; it is a fruit of drawing, or the sweet and powerful
   attraction which the Spirit of God useth in the hearts of the elect.
   Instances I might give you in several calls and conversions spoken of
   in scripture. When Christ called Andrew and Peter, [2] They left their
   father and followed after him,' Mark i. 20. So when Christ called
   Zaccheus, he made haste, and came down from the tree, and received him
   joyfully," Luke xix. 6. So Christ to Matthew, Follow me, and
   straightway he followed him,' Mat. ix. 9. Julian the apostate scoffs at
   these passages, as if it were irrational to conceive such a thing could
   be, that men should so soon leave their course of gain and calling; or
   else that Christ's followers were a kind of sots and fools, weak, and
   poor-spirited creatures, that upon a word speaking they would come off
   presently all of a sudden: but impulsions of the Spirit carry their own
   reason with them, and draw the heart without any more ado. But such as
   he were not acquainted with the workings of the Holy Ghost in
   conversion, therefore scoff at these things. So Gal. i. 16, Immediately
   I conferred not with flesh and blood.' When our call is clear, there
   needs no debate. When men stand reasoning instead of running, there is
   not a thorough work upon them.

   Reas. 2. The sooner we turn to the ways of God the better we speed. How
   so?

   1. Partly in this, that the work goes on the more kindly, as being
   carried forth in the strength of the present influence and impulsion of
   grace; whereas, if the heart grow cold again, it will be the more
   difficult. A blow while the iron is hot doth more than ten at another
   time when it grows cold again. So when thy heart grows cold, thou wilt
   not have that advantage as when thou art under a warm conviction. And
   indeed that is the devil's cheat, to speak of hereafter, to elude the
   importunity of the present conviction that is upon you. John v. 4, You
   know when the waters were stirred, then was the time to put in, he that
   stepped in first had experience of the sanative virtue of the waters;
   so when the heart is stirred, we should not lose this advantage, but
   come on upon that call. There are several metaphors in scripture that
   do express this; sometimes, we must open when God knocks, Cant. v.; we
   must enter when God opens, lest the door be shut against us, Mat. xxv.;
   we must come forth when he bids us, as Lot out of Sodom, lest we
   perish: when a thing is done speedily and in season it is a great
   advantage.

   2. The more welcome to God the sooner we turn to him. We value a gift
   not only by its own worth, but by the readiness of him that gives; if
   we have it at first asking, we count it a greater kindness, and give
   the more thanks; so the less we stand bucking with God, and demurring
   upon his call, the more acceptable is our obedience. Pharaoh did at
   length let Israel go, but was forced to it, and with much ado, no
   thanks to him. It is true indeed, if we turn at length seriously,
   heartily, we are accepted with God, but not so accepted as when we come
   in at first. Surely the fewer calls we withstand, the less we provoke
   God, and the more ready entertainment do we find. The spouse, that
   would not open at the first knock, but only at length, when her bowels
   were troubled, when she thought of her unkindness, then she went out to
   open to her beloved, but then her beloved was gone. You will not find
   God at your beck when you dally with him. Your comforts will cost you
   longer waiting for, when you make God wait for entrance, and would not
   give way to the work of his grace.

   3. You speed better, because your personal benefit is the greater, the
   sooner you turn to the Lord. You have more knowledge, more experience,
   you get more comfort, you would be more profitable to' others, more
   useful to God. If ever God touch your hearts, and once you come to
   experiment what an excellent thing it is to live in communion with God,
   you will be sorry you began no sooner. Paul complains that he was as a
   man born out of due time,' 1 Cor. xv. 8, and so had not the advantage
   of seeing Christ in the flesh, until he showed him self to him from
   heaven in the vision upon his conversion. You lose many a comfortable
   sight of Christ because you were so late acquainted with him. And it is
   said of Andronicus and Junius, Rom. xvi. 7, they were in Christ before
   me.' Certainly he that is first in Christ, and sooner called to grace,
   hath the advantage of us. An early acquaintance with God gives us
   advantages both in point of enjoyment and service. In point of
   enjoyment; peace, comfort, joy in the Holy Ghost. A man would not want
   these things, they are so valuable in themselves; the want of them is
   an incomparable loss to us. Certainly they would have been much better
   than all those flesh-pleasing vanities that you dote upon, and keep you
   from Christ. A man that hath for a long while wasted his time and
   strength in driving on a peddling trade, when he is acquainted with a
   more gainful course, Oh, saith he, that I had known this sooner! so,
   none have any taste of the ways of God, but they will wish so; Oh, that
   I had sooner renounced my carnal delights, and betaken myself to the
   service of God!

   Then advantages in point of service. What honour might we have brought
   to God, what good done to others, if we had begun sooner! Oh, saith
   one, had I but the time to spend again which I trifled away in the
   devil's service! What use might I have made of the vigour and freshness
   of my youth, and quickness of my parts for God, and the large tract of
   time which I spent in sin and vanity! Every day in a carnal state was a
   loss of opportunity of service, the glorifying of God, the great end
   for which you were made.

   Reas. 3. There is danger and hazard in delay and putting off a business
   of such concernment, as conversion to God and his ways is, upon such
   uncertainties. For the understanding of the force of this reason--

   1. Let us determine that this is a business of the greatest
   concernment, and that will show us the folly of our delays, for
   certainly the greatest work should first be thought of. Now if you will
   believe the word of God, that will tell you the salvation of your souls
   should be your main care: Mat. vi. 33, Seek first the kingdom of God
   and his righteousness,' &c.; Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of
   the Lord, and that will I seek after,' &c. Whatever is neglected, this
   is a business that must he looked after. And Luke x. 42, One thing is
   needful.' Let us argue from these places. Certainly that which is
   necessary should be preferred before that which is superfluous. A man
   would take care to get meat rather than sauce, and would prefer his
   business before his recreation, that which is eternal before that which
   is temporal. It is not necessary we should be great and rich in the
   world. Within a little while it will not be a pin to choose what part
   we have acted here. But it is necessary we should be gracious, holy,
   and acquainted with God in Christ; that is our business. Again, that
   which is eternal should be preferred before that which is temporal. You
   count him a fool that is very exact and careful to get his room in an
   inn furnished, when he neglects his house where his constant abode is.
   In the other world there is our long home; and if all our care should
   be here for the present estate, where we tarry but for a night, but a
   little while, and neglect eternity, our everlasting happiness, that
   were a very great folly. That which is spiritual, which concerns our
   soul, should be preferred before that which is carnal and corporal, and
   only concerns the body, for the better part should have the most care.
   As for instance, a man that is wounded and cut through his clothes and
   skin and all, will sooner look to have the wound closed up in his body
   than the rent made up in his garment. So the distempers of the inward
   man should be first cured before we look after the outward man, which
   is as it were the garment and clothing, for these outward things shall
   be added. Here is your work, to please God, not satisfy the flesh. This
   is that which concerns us not only for a while but for ever, and
   concerns the inward man. This is the grand business of concernment;
   therefore we should delay other things rather than delay the work of
   our salvation; yet usually all other things have a quick despatch, and
   this only is neglected and lies by the wall.

   2. That this business of concernment is left upon great hazard and
   uncertainty.

   [1.] Life is uncertain. He that does seriously consider the uncertain
   shortness of the present life, how can he delay a moment, lest he be
   called home to God before his great errand for which he was sent into
   the world be done? Many of you, when you seriously think of it, would
   not for a thousand worlds die the next day so unprovided, unfurnished
   with promises, evidences, experiences; and yet it may be so that that
   may be the time when they shall be called home to God. This life is but
   a vapour,' James iv. 4, a little warm breath turned in and out by the
   nostrils, that is soon choked and stopped; and thou knowest not what
   will be on the morrow,' Prov. xxvii. 1. As that devout person said when
   he was invited to a meal the next day, to come to-morrow to a feast, I
   have not had a morrow for these many years. We have no security for the
   next day but our own word, and he that hath nothing but his own word to
   secure him is very weakly secured. Life is short, and we make it
   shorter by continuing in sin. It is uncertain: if there were a fixed
   time and period wherein we knew our continuance should be in the world,
   then we should be tempted to wallow freely in our carnal lusts, and
   entertain sin a little longer, and put off repentance till hereafter.
   But God hath left life upon great uncertainties; the hand of providence
   may soon crop you off, long before you come to your flower. None are
   nearer to destruction than those that promise themselves a longer time
   in sin: Luke xii. 19, Thou hast goods laid up for many years,' but Thou
   fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.' God loves to
   disappoint secure careless souls that promise themselves a longer life
   without his leave; he will break in upon a sudden. A poor careless
   sinner would fain keep his soul a little longer. No, it is demanded
   now: he doth not give it up, but it is taken away from him. Reason with
   thyself as Isaac, Gen. xxvii. 2 (I allude to it), Behold now I am old,
   I know not the day of my death; make me savoury meats that my soul may
   bless thee before I die.' So reason, I have spent so much time in the
   world, and I know not the day of my dissolution, when God will call me
   home; oh, let me go to God that he may bless me before I die!

   [2.] You know not whether the means of grace shall be continued to you
   or no, and such affectionate offers and melting entreaties: Acts xiii.
   46, Since you put away the word of God from you, you judge yourselves
   unworthy of everlasting life.' God will not always wait upon a
   lingering sinner, but will take the denial and be gone. They judge
   themselves unworthy of that grace, they pass sentence upon themselves:
   2 Cor. vi. 1, 2,' Now is the accepted time, now is the day of
   salvation: we beseech you receive not the grace of God in vain.' God
   hath his seasons, and when these are past, will not treat with us in
   such a mild affectionate manner. The means of grace are removed from a
   people by strange providences, when they have slighted the offers of
   grace: Luke xiii. 7, These three years I came seeking fruit on this
   fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?' In
   that text there is--(1.) God's righteous expectation, These three years
   I came seeking fruit.' He was the dresser of the vineyard; they were
   the three years of his ministry, as by a serious harmonising the
   evangelists will appear that he was just now entering upon his last
   half year they had his ministry among them. (2.) Their unthankful
   frustration, I find none,' nothing answerable to what means they
   enjoyed. (3.) God's terrible denunciation, Cut it down, why cumbereth
   it the ground?' God will root up a people, or remove the means; and
   therefore will ye leave it upon such uncertainties?

   [3.] There is an uncertainty of grace: 2 Tim. ii. 25, If God
   peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
   truth.' It is a mere hazard, it may be he will, it may be not. It is
   uncertain whether the Spirit of God will ever put in your heart a
   thought of turning to God again: Gen. vi. 3, My Spirit shall not always
   strive with man.' The Spirit of God strives for a long while, follows a
   sinner, casts in many an anxious thought, troubles and shakes him out
   of his carnal quiet and security, but this will not always last. Ah,
   Christians! there are certain seasons, if we had the skill to take hold
   of them; there is an appointed fixed time when God is nearer to us than
   at another time, and we shall never have our hearts at such an
   advantage: Isa. lv. 6, Call upon him while he is near, and while he may
   be found.' There are certain seasons which are times of finding. Some
   are of opinion that there are certain seasons when a man may be rich if
   he will, when God offereth him an opportunity for an estate in the
   world, if he knew the time and how to take hold of it. Certainly to
   those that live under the means of grace there is a time of finding,
   when God is nearer to them than at another time, and therefore will you
   slip that, and leave it upon such great uncertainties?

   [4.] There is an uncertainty in this; we are not certain of having the
   use of our natural faculties; we may lose our understandings by a
   stupid disease, and God may bring a judgment upon those that dally with
   him in the work of repentance. It is a usual judgment upon them that
   while they were alive did forget God, when they come to die, to forget
   themselves, and have not the free use of their reason, but, invaded
   with some stupid disease, die in their sins, and so pass into another
   world.

   Reas. 4. The fourth reason is the great mischief of delay.

   1. The longer we delay the greater indisposition is there upon us to
   embrace the ways of God. O Christians! when we press you to holy
   things, to turn yourselves to the Lord, you begin to make some essay,
   and then are discouraged, and find it is hard and tedious to flesh and
   blood, and so you give over. Now mark, if it be hard to-day, it will be
   harder the next, so the third onward, for it is hardness of heart that
   makes the work of God hard. Now the more we provoke God, the more we
   resist his call, the more hard the heart is; the impulsions of his
   grace are not so strong as before, and the heart every day is more
   hardened. As a path weareth the harder by frequent treading, so the
   heart is more hard, the mind more blind, the will more obstinate, the
   affections more engaged and rooted in a course of sin: Jer. xiii. 23,
   Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may
   ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil.' Oh, to break off an
   inveterate custom is hard! A plant newly set is more easily taken up
   than a plant that hath taken root. When we grow old and rotten in the
   way of sin, it will be much harder for us than now it is: the longer we
   lie soaking here in sin, the farther off from God.

   2. We provide the more discomfort for ourselves. Always the proportion
   of our sorrow is according to the measure of our sins. Whether it be
   godly sorrow, the sorrow of repentance, or despairing sorrow, those
   horrors which are impressed upon us as a punishment of our rebellion
   and impenitency, in both senses you still increase your sorrow the more
   you sin. For the sorrow of repentance, it is clear that sorrow must
   carry proportion with our offences. She that had much for given wept
   much. Certainly it will cost you the more tears, a greater humbling
   before God, the longer you continue in a course of sin against him. And
   for the sorrow of punishment, you are treasuring up wrath against the
   day of wrath,' Rom. ii. 5. Your burden will be greater and more
   increased upon you. It is too heavy for your shoulders already to bear;
   why should we add to the weight of it? Either our sorrow of repentance
   will be greater, or the anxious sense of our punishment; for in both
   God observes, and God requires a proportion.

   3. Consider how unfit we shall be for God's service if we delay a
   little longer, when our strength is spent, and vigour of youth
   exhausted; when our ears grow deaf, eyes dim, understanding dull,
   affections spent, memory lost. Is this a time to begin with God, and to
   look after the business of our souls? Certainly he that made all, that
   was our Creator, deserves the flower of our strength, Eccles. xii. 1.
   When the tackling is spoiled and ship rotten, is that a time to put to
   sea? or rather when the ship is new built? Shall the devil feast upon
   the flower and freshness of your youth, and God only have the scraps
   and fragments of the devil's table? When we are good for nothing else,
   then to think we are good enough for God and the business of religion,
   which requires all our might and all our strength, when we are spent,
   is it a time to begin our warfare, or in our youth?

   4. There is this, the just suspicion which is upon a late repentance;
   it is seldom sound; it is no true repentance which ariseth merely from
   horror and fear of hell. It may be but the beginnings of everlasting
   despair, and their desires may be but offers of self-love after their
   own ease. All men seek the Lord at length, but wise men seek him
   betimes. The difference is made on some in time, on others out of time,
   upon their death-beds. The most profane would have God for their
   portion when they can sin no more, and enjoy the world no longer.
   &gt;How can we tell this is a sound work? It seems to be a very
   questionable thing, merely proceeding from self-love and natural
   desires of happiness in all men. When we begin with God, we begin out
   of self-love, we come for our ease and interest, that we may be safe
   and happy; afterwards we come to a delight of spirit in his service,
   and having opportunity, show in our works the power of our affection to
   God, and manifest the soundness of our conversion. It is possible a
   death-bed repentance may be true, but it is very doubtful. There is but
   one instance, which is that of the thief upon the cross. The scriptures
   are a history of five thousand years; yet all that while we have but
   one instance of a man that repented when he came to die; and in that
   one instance there is an extraordinary conjunction of circumstances,
   such as will never fall out again. Christ was at the thief's right
   hand, in the height of his love, drawing sinners to salvation; and
   probably this man had never any such call till then. Some may at the
   eleventh hour be converted, because they were not called till then.
   Every one came when they were called. Therefore, there being so great
   and just a suspicion that lies against a late repentance, certainly we
   should not delay.

   Reas. 5. The reasons for delay are very inconsiderable. Solomon saith,
   Prov. xxvi. 16, that the sluggard thinks himself wiser than seven men
   that can render a reason.' Mark, as Solomon's fool is not to be taken
   literally, but spiritually, so Solomon's sluggard is not to be taken
   morally, but spiritually. They that are sluggish and slow of heart in
   the things of God, they think they have a great deal of reason on their
   side, and will not be persuaded on the contrary but they shall do well
   enough for all that; and they can argue against the calls and
   injunctions of God. Yet how little can they say for themselves! See
   what reasons may be said for delay; I mean not that they plead and
   argue, but it is -that which sways them, that which lies next the heart
   is this; why they keep off from God, and are satisfied with their
   present estate.

   1. The pleasures of sin are sweet, and they are loath to forego them,
   and to engage their souls in the severities of a strict obedience. Here
   is the bottom reason, this is, that which sways them. I will not speak
   to this plea as it lies against conversion itself, but only as it makes
   men to delay. If I were to plead for conversion itself, I would tell
   these carnalists of higher pleasure; that their delights shall not be
   abrogated, but preserved; their delight shall be transplanted from
   Egypt to Canaan, that it may thrive and prosper in a happier soil; that
   they may have purer contentments, and those chaste and happy
   satisfactions of enjoying communion with God. But I shall only deal
   with them as it relates to the delay of conversion. Therefore I thus
   argue: These pleasures of sin must one day be renounced, or you are for
   ever miserable; and if you must one day, why not now? For mark, sin
   will be as sweet hereafter as it now is, and salvation is always
   dispensed upon the same terms; you cannot be saved hereafter with less
   ado, or bring down Christ and heaven to a lower rate; and, therefore,
   if this be a reason now, it will ever lie as a reason against Christ
   and religion, then you will never tend to look after the ways of life;
   if you are loath to part with sin now, you will never part with it. The
   laws of Christianity are always the same. God will not bate you
   anything of repentance, and your heart is not like to be better, but
   worse, that is the sum of it; and therefore this reason signifies
   nothing when it conies to be tried in the balance of the sanctuary, and
   yet this is the main reason.

   2. They can plead other things; hope God will be merciful to them
   hereafter; though they indulge themselves a little longer in sin, he
   will at length save them. I answer--You cannot bend his mercy and make
   it save; it is a mere uncertainty, peradventure he will, peradventure
   not. Would you take poison, out of hope that afterward you may meet
   with an antidote? And this is the very case between God and us. I
   answer further--There are shrewd suspicions that God will not be
   merciful to those that run such a desperate adventure; for whoever
   delays his repentance doth in effect pawn his soul with the devil, and
   leaves it in his hands, and says, Here, Satan, keep my soul; if I fetch
   it not again by such a day, it is thine for ever: and can you think
   mercy will bring it out? Again, there are great causes of fear, because
   there is such a thing as judicial hardness of heart, by a sentence of
   obduration. There are some that God gives up to their own ways and
   counsels, and God inflicts this sentence upon those that continue in
   sin, notwithstanding conviction of their hearts to the contrary: Prov.
   i. 25, 26, Ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
   reproof: I will also laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear
   cometh.' There are thousands in hell merely upon this account, that
   have forfeited the benefit of God's mercy, and tenders of his grace,
   and have been shut up by hardness of heart, by God's sentence of
   obduration; the most dreadful punishment that can light upon a creature
   on this side hell.

   3. Ay! but we are willing, and would turn to the Lord now, but we have
   no leisure, and have not those conveniences that we shall have here
   after, for then we shall get things into a better frame and posture.
   Oh, no; it is mere hypocrisy to think you are willing when you delay,
   for there is nothing hinders but a want of will, and a loathness to
   comply with the commands of God. When we dare not flatly deny, then we
   delay. Non vacat, that is the sinner's plea, I am not at leisure; but
   non placet, there is the reality. Mat. xxii. 7, they which were invited
   to the wed ding varnished their denial over with an excuse. Delay is a
   denial, for if they were willing there would be no excuse. To be rid of
   importunate and troublesome creditors, we promise them payment another
   time, and we know our estate will be more wasted by that time; it is
   but to put them off: so this delay and putting off God is but a shift.
   Here is the misery, God always comes unseasonably to a carnal heart. It
   was the devils that said, Mat. viii. 29, Art thou come to torment us
   before our time?' Good things are a torment to a carnal heart, and they
   always come out of time. Certainly that is the best time when the word
   is pressed upon the heart with evidence, light, and power, and when God
   treats with thee about thine eternal peace.

   Reas. 6. There are very urgent reasons to quicken us to make haste.

   1. The state wherein we are at present is so bad and dangerous that we
   can never soon enough come out of it. The state of a man in his carnal
   condition is compared in scripture to a prison: Rom. xi. 32, God hath
   concluded or shut them all up in unbelief.' And mark, it is a prison
   that is all on fire. Oh, when poor captives are bolted and shut up in a
   flaming prison, how will they run hither and thither to get out! So
   should we run and strive to get out of this flaming prison. You cannot
   be too soon out of the power of the devil, or from under the curse of
   the law, the danger of hell-fire, and the dominion of sin: Mat. iii. 7,
   Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?' He doth not say,
   to go, nor to run, but to flee. Fleeing from wrath to come, that is the
   truest motion. And so Heb. vi. 18; they which had the avenger of blood
   at their heels fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before
   them. If there be poison in our bowels we think we can never soon
   enough cast it out. If fire hath taken hold of a building, we do not
   say we will quench it hereafter, the next week, or next month, but
   think we can never soon enough quench it. Or if there be a wound in the
   body, we do not let it alone till it fester and rankle. Christians, you
   may apply all this to the present case; here the danger is greater.
   There is no poison so deadly as sin, which hath infected all mankind:
   no wound so dangerous, for that will be the death of body and soul: no
   fire so dreadful as the wrath of God; therefore we cannot soon enough
   come out of this condition.

   2. We cannot be happy soon enough, for the state we make after is the
   arms of God, the bosom of Jesus, the hope of eternal life; we cannot
   soon enough get within the compass of such privileges. Oh! shall Christ
   lie by as a dead commodity or breaded [3] ware? It shows we know not
   the gift of God, John iv. If we had a due sense and value of his
   excellency, we would take the morning market, and let not Christ Jesus,
   with all his benefits, lie by as a commodity that may be had at the
   last, at any time of the day; we would look upon him as the quickest
   ware in the market, and flock to him as doves to the windows,' Isa. lx.
   8. You would force your way that you might get into his heart; you
   would count all things but dross and dung that you might gain him. It
   will be sweet to be encircled in the embraces of Jesus Christ, to have
   his left hand under your head, and his right hand to embrace you," Cant

SERMON LXVIII.

   I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.--Ver. 60.

   I COME now to the application.

   Use 1. To reprove the dallying with God which we are conscious to in
   the work of conversion, which is so common and natural to us. We are
   apt to put off God from time to time, from childhood to youth, from
   youth to man's age, from man's age to old age, and from old age to
   death-bed; and so the devil steals away one hour after another till all
   time be past.

   I shall--(1.) Speak of the causes of this delay; (2.) Represent the
   heinousness of it, that you may not stroke this sin with a gentle
   censure, and think lightly of the matter.

   First, Of the causes of this delay.

   1. Unbelief, or want of a due sense or sight of things to come. If men
   were persuaded of eternal life and eternal death, they would not stand
   hovering so long between heaven and hell, but presently engage their
   hearts to draw nigh to God. But we cannot see afar off,' 2 Peter i. 9.
   Nature is purblind: to carnal hearts there is a mist upon eternity,
   they have no prospective whereby to look into another world, therefore
   it hath no influence upon them to quicken them to more speed and
   earnestness. If we had a due sense of eternal death, surely we would be
   fleeing from wrath to come; no motion should be earnest and swift
   enough to get from such a danger. If we had a due sense of eternal
   life, we would be running to take hold of the hope that is before us,'
   Heb. vi. 18.

   2. Security. If men have a cold belief of heaven and hell, if they take
   up the current opinions of the country, yet do not take it into their
   serious thoughts, they put far away the evil day,' Amos vi. 3. Things
   at a distance do not startle us, as a clap of thunder afar off doth not
   fright us so much as when it is just over our heads in our own zenith.
   We look upon these things as to come, so put off the thought of them.
   Next to a want of sound belief, the want of a serious consideration is
   the cause why men dally with God. If we had the same thoughts living
   and dying, our motions would be more earnest and ready. When death and
   eternity is near, we are otherwise affected than when we look upon it
   as afar off. One said of a zealous preacher, He preacheth as if death
   were at my back. Oh, could we look upon death as at our back or heels!
   If men did but consider that within a few days they must go to heaven
   or hell, that there is but the slender thread of a frail life upon
   which they depend, that is soon fretted asunder, they would not venture
   any longer to be out of a state of grace, nor dally with God. But we
   think we may live long, and time enough to repent by leisure; we put
   far off the day of our change, and so are undone by our own security.

   3. Averseness of heart from God. That which makes us desirous to stay
   longer in a way of sin, doth indeed make us loath to turn at all; and
   what is that? Obstinacy and unsubjection of heart to God: The carnal
   mind is enmity to the law of God,' Rom. viii. 7. We manifest our enmity
   to the law of God by delays as well as by a down right opposition. Neh.
   iv. 6, it is said the work went on speedily. Why? For the people had a
   mind to the work.' Where there is an earnest bent of heart, there we
   cannot linger and dally any longer. But men have no love nor affection
   to God, therefore do they delay und keep off from him.

   4. The love of the world rooted in us, the love of present delights and
   present contentments. This is so deeply rooted in our nature, that here
   we stick, and are loath to come off kindly to the work of God. In Mat.
   xxii., when they were invited to the marriage-feast of the king's son,
   that is, to the privileges of the gospel, what did they plead? The
   farm, oxen, merchandise, and one had married a wife; they were loath to
   be divorced from their dearest lusts, and to renounce the satisfaction
   which they had in carnal things, that so they might walk with God in a
   way of strict obedience.

   Secondly, Let me represent the heinousness of it. Because we are apt to
   stroke it with a gentle censure, and to speak of this with soft words,
   let us see what this delay and putting off God is, when he comes with a
   great deal of importunity and affectionate earnestness, inviting us to
   partake of his grace.

   1. It is flat disobedience to God. You think it is but putting it off
   for a while; no, it is flat disobedience. Why? God is as peremptory for
   the time and season as he is for the duty itself. God doth not only
   say, Turn to me, but, To-day, even while it is called to-day, harden
   not your hearts,' Heb. iii. 7, 8. The Lord deals with us as the Roman
   ambassador dealt with Antiochus, when he was shifting and putting off
   the matter, that he might not give a direct answer to the Romans. The
   ambassador draws a circle round about him, saith he, Intra hunc, Let me
   have an answer before thou passest from hence. So God will not only
   have an answer, but a present answer. If he saith, To-day, it is flat
   disobedience for you to say, To-morrow. He saith, Now is the time of
   salvation. We are charged in his name and by his authority to do it
   now, in this instant.

   2. It is ingratitude and unthankfulness for God's eternal love: Ps.
   ciii. 17, From everlasting to everlasting thy loving-kindness is great
   to them that fear thee.' From all eternity God was mindful of us, and
   before the world was. With reverence we may speak it: ever since he was
   God he was our God: from eternity to eternity his lovingkindness is
   great; and shall we adjourn and put him off to an odd corner of our
   lives, when he thought he could never soon enough think of us? Shall
   the whole duration of God be taken up by his love to us, and shall we
   be content to grieve the Spirit of God, and trample his laws under our
   feet for all this? Can you have hearts to abuse such a God, and to deal
   so unkindly with him?

   3. It is base disingenuity: we do not deal with God as we would have
   God to deal with us. If we have any business or errand at the throne of
   grace, we would be heard presently, and are ready to complain if we
   have not a quick despatch: Ps. cii. 2, Lord, hear me speedily.' Here is
   our language when praying for any relief we stand in need of. To-day is
   a season for mercy, but to-morrow we make always to be the season for
   duty. We would have God to tarry our sinful leisure, till the heat of
   our lusts be spent, and fervours of youth be abated; yet we will not
   tarry his holy leisure. We are bound, but the Lord is free whether he
   will answer us or no; yet we murmur if God come not in at our beck. We
   are always in haste if in any danger and want any relief; we cry, How
   long? And shall God stand waiting till we turn from our evil ways? If
   any cry, How long? God may, as he doth Jer. xiii. 27, When shall it
   once be?'

   4. It is base self-love when we can be content to dishonour God longer,
   provided that at length we may be saved. Shall I say that this is to
   prefer our salvation before God? No, but it is to prefer our sins
   before God. And it shows that we are not willing to part with sin upon
   reasons of duty, or any real inclination of heart towards God, but only
   upon reasons of interest, that we maybe saved; yea, never to part with
   it at all if you might have your wills. Not but that a man may and
   ought to eye rewards and punishments. It is part of the exercise of our
   faith to eye the reward, and also to eye the punishment; but this
   manifests an inordinate respect to the reward when we would enjoy our
   personal happiness, and so that be obtained at length, we care not how
   God be disobeyed and dishonoured. You do but in effect say to God thus,
   Let me despise thy commands, and abuse thy mercies a little longer;
   then I will look after my salvation, when my lusts are satisfied. This
   is base self-love. Christ did not redeem us only that we might die
   well, but that we might live well; not only that we might be safe at
   last, but glorify God here upon earth; not only that we might enter
   into heaven, but do him service, and that all our days: Luke i. 74,
   Being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him
   without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our life.'

   5. It is great injustice and injury to God, who hath been too long kept
   out of his right already. Oh, look back! How ungratefully have you
   spent all your former time! Too much time hath been spent already, and
   you would delay longer: 1 Peter iv. 3, The time past may more than
   suffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,' &c. It is enough,
   and should be more than enough, and now you should not stay a moment.
   As those that have delayed their journey, when they begin and set out,
   mend their pace that they may redeem their time and accomplish their
   journey; so should we, for the time past is more than enough to be
   spent in worldly vanity and carnal excess: Rom. xiii. 11-14, It is high
   time to awake out of sin.' God hath been encroached upon for a long
   time, and that should and will be a grief of heart to you, that you
   have not all this while acknowledged or paid your debt to your lord.
   The thought of this should prevail with us the more, because the
   payment of a debt to a man should not be delayed, to put off a poor man
   till to-morrow when thou hast it by thee,' Prov. iii. 28; and the wages
   of a servant should not abide with us, Lev. xix. 13. We are not to
   defraud a poor servant, nor to delay him, but to make him quick
   payment; and shall we defraud our great Creator of the debt we owe to
   him, and put him off from day to day?

   Use 2. To exhort us with speed to turn to the Lord, and to comply with
   his motions. Let us not put off God from day to day. I shall urge
   it--(1.) As to the general case; (2.) As to particular duties which are
   pressed upon you.

   First, As to the general case. Oh! go and bethink yourselves, how do
   matters stand between God and thy soul? Debate it seriously, that if
   you have neglected God and his salvation already, you may now turn to
   him without delay. Let me press you further.

   1. You can never part with sin soon enough; it is a cursed inmate, that
   will surely bring mischief upon the soul that harbours it. It will set
   its own dwelling on fire. If there be a mote in the eye, a thorn in the
   foot, we take them out without delay; and is not sin a greater
   mischief, and sooner to be looked into and parted with? Certainly the
   evil of sin is greater than all evil, and hereafter the trouble will be
   greater; therefore we can never soon enough part with it.

   2. Let this move you: sin must have a quick despatch, and shall not
   God? It would defeat temptations if we would but delay them, it would
   stop the furies of anger, and suppress the motions of lust. Augustus
   the emperor advised those who were angry to repeat the Greek alphabet,
   meaning that they might take time to consider. So for uncleanness and
   other sins; if the practice and execution of many lusts were but
   delayed, we would not be so frequent in them as we are, to the
   dishonour of God and scandal of religion. Prov. vii. 22, it is said of
   the young man enticed by the harlot, that forthwith he went after her.'
   When our lusts are agog, all the checks of conscience and persuasions
   of the word will not prevail for a little respite. Now, shall sin have
   a more ready entertainment than God? Will you rush upon the practice of
   sin like a horse into the battle, and come on in the service of God
   like a snail? Will you be so eager and passionate upon the impulsion of
   every lust, and so hardly be entreated by the Spirit of God and by the
   word of God?

   3. If you be not ready, God is ready. How ready is he, on the one hand,
   to receive you, and, on the other hand, to punish you! The one quickens
   us by hope, and the other by fear. For the consideration which works
   upon hope, God is ready: Mat. xxii. 4, 5, Come to the wedding, all
   things are ready.' He hath a Christ ready to receive you, a Spirit
   ready to sanctify and cure all your soul distempers; he hath pardoning
   mercy to forgive all your sins, he hath power of grace to remedy all
   your distempers; and will not you be ready? Luke xv. 20, the prodigal
   said, I will go to my father.' Mark his language, I will go;' the
   father ran. When we do but relent, and with brokenness of heart come
   and lie at the feet of God, love's pace is very swift, and runs to
   snatch us out of the fire; therefore will you not be ready to cast
   yourselves into the arms of his compassion? Cant. ii. 8, Christ is
   represented as leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
   hills.' Christ thinks he can never be soon and early enough with a
   returning sinner, to revive a poor broken-hearted sinner; therefore, if
   God be so ready, so should you. On the other side, to work upon your
   fear, if you delay, God is ready to punish you. The wrath of God hangs
   over your heads like a sharp sword by a slender thread, and will you
   sit still and keep your place? The judge is at the door;' he is ready
   to judge, James v. 9. Are you ready to be judged? God is ready to
   condemn, to execute, and are not you ready to implore mercy, to seek
   the Lord's favour? ready to fall flat, and beg terms of grace in and
   through Christ Jesus? Rahab, when the Lord had by his messengers
   threatened destruction to Jericho, only Rahab's house was to be safe.
   She hanged out a scarlet thread ere the spies were departed, Josh. ii.;
   she did not delay till the army came and the city was surprised. When
   the Lord is marching against sinners with vengeance and fury, you
   cannot come soon enough to God to prevent it, Luke xiv. 32. That king
   that had twenty thousand marching against him, doth not stay till they
   were in his quarters, but while the other is yet a great way off, he
   sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace. God is ready to
   execute all his vengeance and curses of the law; therefore, while you
   may, seek conditions of peace. You have been spared long; it may be for
   the next sin you may pay for all. A thief that hath long escaped, when
   he is taken at length, all his villany is recompensed into his bosom;
   if he had not stolen the last time, he had escaped. God hath spared you
   hitherto; it may be upon the next sin he will strike you, and hold his
   hands no longer. If God now strike, in what a woful case would you be?

   4. There was never any that came to God too soon; many have come too
   late, the foolish virgins are an instance. When they brought little
   children to Christ, Christ received them. There are none so little but
   the great God can form and fashion them into a temple for himself.
   Usually God chooseth his people from among the youth. There may be some
   converted in old age, but few; usually it is in our youth, or as soon
   as we come to our maturity. Reason thus: I may be too late, I cannot be
   too early; let me no longer dally with God.

   Secondly, As to the particular duties which are pressed upon you, let
   me caution you and direct you.

   1. By way of caution.

   [1.] When you have any stirrings of heart, any anxious thoughts about
   your eternal condition, beware you do not believe the devil, that
   hereafter will be a more convenient season. I shall give directions
   suitable to the grand enemies of our salvation, the devil, the world,
   and the flesh, Now, do not believe the devil. This was Felix's case.
   Paul was reasoning of justice and temperance, graces that he was little
   acquainted withal, and Paul quickens all by a remembrance of judgment
   to come, and then Felix trembled. But how doth he put off this
   heart-work? Hereafter we shall have a more convenient season,' Acts
   xxiv. 25. Oh! never will it be better with you than now when the waters
   are stirred. Still there is something in the sinner's way when God hath
   any business for him. When young, we want wisdom; when old, we want
   strength; in the middle of business, we want leisure; in the midst of
   leisure, we are corrupted and want a heart. We are lazy, and then every
   molehill seems a mountain. Remember, if the devil can but get us to
   delay, he hath us fast enough. If he can but get us to put it off
   to-day, then to-morrow, then the next day, shall be as that. Austin,
   when he had conviction upon him, he prays from his conscience, Lord,
   mortify my lusts, but not yet. Satan's morrow will never come. There is
   no end of delays. He tells you of to-morrow and another season, but
   that season will never come.

   [2.] Let not the world choke the word. It is notable the choking the
   good seed which was scattered among thorns. Christ expounds it of the
   world. Now what of the world choketh it? Mat. xiii. 22, he instanceth
   in the cares of the world:' and Luke instanceth in the pleasures of
   this life:' he adds voluptuous living,' Luke viii. 14; and Mark hath it
   more generally, the cares of this life,' Mark iv. 19; and the lusts of
   other things choke the word.' The meaning of all those places is this:
   Many a man hath some beams of light darted into his bosom, and he
   begins to have serious and anxious thoughts of his eternal condition.
   Ay! but then the pleasures and cares of the world interpose, and they
   must be first served, and so the conviction is lost. Sometimes a man is
   full of business, and cannot attend to carrying on this work; at other
   times he is loath to forego his voluptuous course; there is some sport
   he must attend upon, and so the word is lost When you have conviction
   upon you, you are under God's arrest; when you go and get out of the
   chains of conscience without God's leave, you break prison. All
   business must give way to your great business, and follow that close
   till you come to some issue: Mat. viii. 21, Follow me,' saith Christ.
   Suffer me first to go bury my father.' Nay,' saith Christ, let the dead
   bury the dead, but do thou follow me.' How specious soever the work be,
   we must call off our souls. Let not these beams of conviction which are
   darted into your bosom be quenched.

   [3.] Consult not with the flesh, as a friend in the case, when your
   heart begins to work towards God: Gal. i. 16, Immediately I consulted
   not with flesh and blood.' It is notable the word signifies to lay down
   a burden, to lay down our cares and difficulties in a friend's bosom.
   When a man hath any trouble upon him he communicates it to his friend.
   Now, you have a burden upon you, you begin to be sensible you are in a
   wrong course, and must turn to God. Do not lay down your burdens in the
   flesh's bosom; they will tell you this is but a pang and melancholy
   qualm, and would furnish you with a great many seeming reasons to put
   it off, frivolous excuses, slothful pretences, carnal fears, and idle
   allegations; therefore consult not with the flesh as with a friend in
   the case.

   [4.] Be not discouraged with tediousness and difficulty, which, upon a
   trial, you will find in the ways of God. Many that carry on their
   convictions to a resolution, and their good resolutions to some
   performance, when they find it to be a difficult and tedious business,
   a thing that is irksome to the flesh, they throw up all, and there is
   an end of the conviction that was upon them. A bullock at first yoking
   is most unruly until he be accustomed to it; so afterwards duty will be
   more sweet and easy: if you will but take Christ's yoke upon trial, you
   shall find it is a sweet yoke, Mat. xi. 29. And remember, difficulties
   in the service of God should rather excite than discourage. Will you
   serve God with that which cost you nothing? Will you think to go to
   heaven, and not enter in at the strait gate? Remember, this is one of
   our waymarks. Counterbalance difficulty with reward, and punishment and
   pains of duty with the pains of hell, the pleasure of sin with the
   reward of eternal life: urge your souls with the equity in Christ's
   ways, and the filthiness and turpitude in those sinful courses.

   [5.] If you have discouragements from God, and he seems to with draw or
   withhold his grace, remember he is not at your beck: if he gives
   nothing he oweth nothing. If he should not give present comfort,
   strength, and help, usually it may be so for your trial. We are never
   brought to a thorough obedience until we come to this resolution: Let
   God do what he will, I will do what he hath commanded; till we yield to
   God's sovereignty, and venture through his denials and the suspensions
   of his grace. As the woman of Canaan, he first answereth her not a
   word; when he answers, his speech is more discouraging than his
   silence, It is not meet to take the children's bread and give it to
   dogs.' She ventures through all these discouragements. Christ yields at
   length: O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee as thou wilt.' God
   will bring his creatures to such a thorough obedience. You may have no
   visits of his love, no beam of his grace; though you meet with a dumb
   oracle, and he seems to cast you off, and you have many fears, yet
   venture through with a holy obstinacy that you will not give over; as
   Job xiii. 15, Though he kill me, yet will I put my trust in him.' When
   you follow God with such an obstinacy of obedience, though he should
   appear never so contrary, yet we will encourage ourselves in waiting
   upon him. Thus be severe to your purpose.

   2. For positive directions.

   [1.] Observe the call of God. There are certain seasons when God more
   especially doth approach the heart of a sinner, when Christ knocks:
   Rev. iii. 20, Behold, I stand at the door and knock.' How doth Christ
   knock? By the motions of his grace, when the word sets conscience
   awork. One time or other God meets with the heart of every man that
   lives under the gospel, so that his conscience tells him, I must be
   another man, or I am an undone man for ever. Then Christ knocks when
   conscience is thus set awork; when the waters are stirred, then is the
   time to put in for cure. Now observe this, that you may welcome the
   authority of his truth. To resist Christ in this work is a dangerous
   thing. For a woman to destroy the child in the womb is murder; so to
   resist Christ in this work that is going on towards the new birth is
   spiritual murder.

   [2.] Be sure this work come to some effect. To stifle convictions, that
   is very dangerous. There is no iron so hard as that which hath been
   often heated and often quenched; so no hearts so hard as those that
   have had many convictions and have quenched them: 1 Thes. v. 19, Quench
   not the Spirit.' You have great qualms of conscience. Felix he
   trembles; ay! but it came to nothing. Many men's hearts are roused, but
   it does no good. A man that sleeps upon a bridge may dream that he is
   falling into the water, and so dream that he may shake every limb of
   him, and so shake and tremble that he may cry out in his sleep. Ay! but
   the man doth not awake, and rouse up that he may avoid the danger. So
   the word of God may work so far that they begin to fear they are even
   dropping into the pit; they have anxious thoughts about their eternal
   condition, but still they sleep till their security overcome their
   fear, and so this work comes to nothing. And therefore, be not
   contented to have some motions upon thy soul now and then, some
   involuntary impressions, but see what they come to: Eph. v. 14, Awake,
   thou that sleepest,' &c. When Christ hath awakened thee, and thou
   beginnest to be startled in the sleep of thy security, rouse up thyself
   and be serious.

   [3.] Actuate thy thoughts by a sound belief and application of
   eternity, that you may not lose your convictions. First by a belief,
   and then by an application. This is that which doth actuate and enliven
   all those truths that set on the work of God. First, by a belief of
   eternity. Surely there is good and evil, there is hope and fear,
   therefore there is heaven and hell. Say, there are two states, a state
   of nature and a state of grace; and these two states have respect to
   two covenants--a covenant of works, that worketh bondage, and binds me
   over to punishment, and a covenant of grace; and both these do issue
   themselves at length into heaven and hell. This is the great sum of our
   religion. And conscience and reason will tell me there is a world to
   come; there must be a time when God will deal more severely with
   sinners than he doth in the present life. Enliven your thoughts by
   strengthening your belief of eternity, for this is that which doth set
   home all the exhortations of his word, and which makes our thoughts
   serious. And then, secondly, by a serious application of these things
   to yourselves. If you would have these hopes, apply the offer of heaven
   to work upon your hope, and the commination of hell to work upon your
   fear. The offer of heaven: If I would be blessed in Christ, surely I
   must mend my course. Now, Acts iii. 26, He hath sent him to bless you,
   in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.' When there is an
   offer that comes in with power upon the heart, then Christ is sent to
   turn me from my sins, that I may be the inheritor of an everlasting
   blessing; and shall I not let go my sins? I have often flattered myself
   with this, Sure I am willing to be saved; but I cannot be saved if I
   live in my sins, otherwise I am no more willing to be saved than the
   devils, for they are willing to be saved from the wrath of God for
   ever. A creature is willing to be eased of his torment, and every one
   would have eternal life: Evermore give me this life. Now, let Christ do
   his work to turn you from your sins. So by working upon your fear: Here
   God hath threatened me with eternal damnation if I do not hearken. Now
   scourge thy soul with that smart question, Heb. ii. 3, How shall I
   escape if I neglect so great salvation?' How shall I escape the
   damnation of hell if I turn back upon his offer, if I deal slightly
   with God in a business which so nearly concerns my soul?

   [4.] Issue forth a practical decree for God in the soul. When the heart
   is backward, we have no remedy left but to decree for God. David makes
   a decree in the court of conscience: Ps. xxxii. 5, I said, I will
   confess my sins unto the Lord.' I said, I determined, I would go and
   lie at God's foot, and humble myself; so I said--set down a resolution
   which shall be like the laws of the Medes and Persians, never to be
   reversed--that thou wilt for this present and ever hereafter wait upon
   the means, and give way to the work of God upon thy soul; resolve that
   you will go and lie at God's feet, and say, Lord, turn me: I am as a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,' Jer. xxxi. 18. thou hast forbidden
   me to despair, and commanded thy creature to come to thee for
   grace--here I cast myself at the footstool of thy mercy; and resolve
   you will keep up your endeavours in all the means of grace in hearing
   the word, prayer, &c. Though no sensible comfort comes, yet in
   obedience perform holy duties: At thy command,' says Peter, I will cast
   out the net,' Luke v. 5. Be diligent and frequent in waiting upon God,
   and look with more seriousness and earnestness of soul after the
   business of eternal life.

SERMON LXIX.

   The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy
   law.--Ver. 61.

   IN the words observe

   1. David's trial.

   2. His constancy under that trial.

   1. His trial is set forth by two things:--

   [1.] The persons from whom it came, the bands of the wicked.

   [2.] The evil done him, have robbed me.

   [1.] The persons, The bands chvly of the wicked.' chvl signifieth a
   cord, and also a troop or company, not of soldiers only, but others: 1
   Sam. x. 5, Thou shalt meet a company or troop of prophets:' it is the
   same word. Those that interpret it cords or ropes, understand it some
   one way, some another. Aben Ezra, the griefs and sorrows prepared for
   the wicked have taken hold of me, and parallels it with Ps. cxvi. 3,
   The sorrows of death compassed me, the pains of hell gat hold of me.'
   Others understand it of the snares the wicked laid for him. But the
   word is better translated by the Chaldee paraphrase, catervae, the
   bands; in our old translation, The congregations of the wicked: he
   meaneth the multitude of his enemies leaguing together against him.

   [2.] The evil done him, they have robbed me.' A man may suffer in his
   name by slander, in his dwelling by his exile, in his liberty by
   imprisonment, in limbs or life by torture and execution, in his estate
   by fine and confiscation. Many are the troubles of the righteous; this
   last is here intended. There are the depredations of thieves and
   robbers, but they do not spoil for religion's sake, but the supply of
   their lusts; the plunderings of soldiers by the license of war, when
   laws cease, so men are robbed or have their goods taken from them by
   violence; or else it may be by pretence of law, by fine and
   confiscation, as it is said: Acts viii. 3, Saul made havoc of the
   churches, and entering into every house, haling men, committed them to
   prison:' Acts ix. 1, Saul, breathing out threatenings and slaughter
   against the disciples, desires letters of the high priest, that if he
   found any of this way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound
   to Jerusalem.' At that time the favourers of the gospel suffered much
   rapine and spoil of goods. Applying it to David's case, some think it
   fulfilled when the Amalekites spoiled Ziklag, 1 Sam. xxx., and took the
   women captives, and the spoil of the city. Some understand it of the
   time when Absalom and his party rifled his house and defiled his
   concubines, 2 Sam. xv.

   2. His constancy. No calamity had wrought upon him so far as to forsake
   God's truth, or go against his conscience in anything.

   Doct. That no temporal loss which can accrue to us by the violence of
   evil men should make us forsake our duty to God.

   1. That this temptation may be greater or less as it is
   circumstantiated. It is here represented by David by this word, the
   bands or the troops of the wicked, which implieth--

   [1.] Their multitudes. One froward wicked man may do much harm in his
   neighbourhood, as there are some whom God reserveth as scourges to his
   people and goads and thorns to their sides; but when many rise up
   against us, the temptation is the greater: Ps. iii. 1, Lord, how are
   they increased which trouble me? many are they which rise up against
   me.' The sincere are but few themselves, and they have many enemies: 1
   John v. 19, We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
   wickedness.' There was a whole world against a handful of Christians,
   but we must not follow a multitude to do evil.'

   [2.] Their confederacy, The bands of the wicked:' Ps. lxxxiii. 5-7,
   They have consulted together with one consent, they are confederate
   against thee, Gebal, Ammon, Amalek.' Though the wicked be at enmity one
   with another, yet they will all agree to destroy the people of God.

   [3.] These were set on mischief; for the bands of the wicked are spoken
   of here as a society opposite to that which is spoken of afterwards,
   ver. 63, I am a companion of them that fear thee, and of them that keep
   thy commandments.' There are two seeds which have enmity one against
   another, the seed of the woman,' and the seed of the serpent,' Gen.
   iii. 15. The far greatest part of the world live an ungodly sensual
   life, and therefore cannot endure those that give an example of a holy
   self-denying life, John xv. 19; therefore the life of godliness is
   usually made matter of common hatred, scorn, and opposition, for the
   sensual and ungodly cannot endure the godly and the heavenly. The more
   exactly any man setteth himself to obey God, the more he crosseth the
   lusts and carnal interests of the wicked, and so the more he commonly
   suffereth in the world. The world is full of malice and prejudice
   against them; they slander them, oppress them, represent them under an
   odious character; and they often meet with disturbances from the
   assaults and injuries of wicked men.

   [4.] The hurt they did him was spoiling and taking away the
   conveniences of the temporal life, they robbed me.' Though it go no
   further, yet to be deprived of those necessary and convenient comforts
   is matter of sorrow in itself. It goeth near to the hearts of
   worldlings to part with them, and therefore by this means they think to
   discourage the people of God; and many times God permitteth it that
   their lives, liberties, and estates shall be much in their power: Ps.
   xliv. 10, They that hate us spoil for themselves.' God leaveth them in
   their hands to dispose of them at their pleasure, which is a great and
   sharp temptation to his people. The Amalekites left no sustenance in
   Israel,' Judges vi. 4.

   2. When a man is said to forsake his duty to God by such trials.

   [1.] When he loseth his patience and meek submission to his will. Thus
   the Lord tried Job by the Sabaeans and Chaldaeans, Job i. 15, 17, who
   took away his oxen, and camels, and all his stock:' yet Job meekly
   submitteth to the Lord's will: ver. 21, The Lord hath given, and the
   Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.' Not o Chaldaios
   aphe'lato, but Job eyeth God both in giving and taking: if he take, he
   gave before, or else we had it not to lose. When we look to instruments
   we are full of wrath: a bucket of water cast upon us enrageth us more
   than a soaking shower that cometh from heaven. Let us see God, without
   whom nothing cometh to pass.

   [2.] When he loseth his comfort and confidence in God, for that is a
   sign we live upon the creature, and cannot trust God without the
   creature. Man knoweth how to put a cheat upon his own heart. When he
   hath all things at full, then he talketh of living by faith; as those
   women who would eat their own bread, and wear their apparel, only call
   us by thy name,' Isa. iv. 1. So they, though all their happiness be
   bound up with the creatures, yet have the wit to give God the name. Now
   God will take away the creature to see how we can live upon himself
   alone: 1 Sam. xxx. 6, David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.' He
   still maintained his hope in the Lord when all was gone, when the
   emptiers had emptied him.

   [3.] When we desert the truth, or go against conscience in any thing.
   David telleth us here, when the bands of the wicked,' &c.; that is, the
   congregations,' says the old translation, as decreeing an unjust
   sentence against him; or bands,' says the new, as appointed to attack
   him; or troops, when the wicked combined against him by troops. So the
   primitive Christians suffered the spoiling of their goods,' Heb. x. 34;
   the Jews endeavoured to make them poor and miserable, that they might
   forsake their Christianity. But we must, with Joseph, leave our coat to
   keep our conscience; and these trials, in short, should be but the
   exercise of our patience and hope, and we should be provoked to do
   nothing but what best becometh God's servants.

   3. That we should not forsake our duty to God for temporal losses.

   [1.] We entered upon the profession of Christianity on these terms:
   Mat. xvi. 24, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
   take up his cross and follow me,' Life, wealth, and honours must be
   forsaken: Luke xiv. 26, If any man come to me, and hate not his father,
   and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
   his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.' Only relations and life
   are there mentioned, goods are not; but afterwards, ver. 33, He that
   forsaketh not all he hath,' voto et praeparatione animi. Yet Christ may
   permit some to break through at a cheaper rate, but all must resolve on
   it, prepare for such a temptation. God hath not excepted it out of his
   covenant and dispensations; he may when he pleases suffer a righteous
   man to be stripped to the skin, therefore we must not except it out of
   our resignation. The wise merchant sold all,' Mat. xiii. 45, 46. When a
   man cometh to accept of Christ, there is a competition. Without this--

   (1.) No true faith. True faith includes in it an election and choice or
   esteem and valuation of Christ, not only as good, but as more excel
   lent, more necessary for us, more beneficial to us than all other
   things. It is praelatio unius rei prae altera, a preference of Christ
   above other things: Phil. iii. 7-9, I count all things loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ,' &c. Christ is apprehended as
   more necessary for the soul; it cometh to him under an apprehension of
   a deep want, and with a broken-hearted sense of misery; we are undone
   without him. We are not so though we want or lose the world; God can
   repair us here, will at last save us without these things: Luke x. 42,
   But one thing is needful.' Christ is esteemed more excellent; the
   rarest comforts of the world are but base things to his grace, but dung
   and dross in comparison; not only uncertain, but vain and empty as to
   any real good: Job xxvii. 8, For what is the hope of the hypocrite,
   though he has gained, when God taketh away his soul?' Christ is more
   beneficial to a poor sinner; in him alone true happiness is to be
   found; therefore we must suffer anything rather than offend our
   Saviour: Rom. viii. 39, No creature is able to separate us from the
   love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.'

   (2.) No true love. Religion without self-denial in one kind or an other
   is Christianity of our own making, not of Christ's. We cull out the
   easy safe part of religion, and then we call this love to God and love
   to Christ. No; the true Christian love is to love God above all. Now,
   one branch of loving God above all is to part with things near and dear
   to us when God calleth us so to do. We must be contented to be
   crucified to the world with our Lord and Master: Mat. x. 37, He that
   loveth father, or mother, or son, or daughter, more that me, is not
   worthy of me.' An underling love Christ will not like or accept.

   [2.] On this condition we possess and enjoy the good things of this
   world, namely, to part with them when God calleth us thereunto. We are
   not absolute owners, but tenants at will: Haggai ii. 8, The silver is
   mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.' The absolute
   disposal of the riches and wealth of the world belongeth unto God, who
   hath all these things, with the power to dispose of them as he
   pleaseth. Therefore he is to be eyed, acknowledged, and submitted unto
   in the ordering of our lot and portion: Hosea ii. 9, I will return, and
   take away my corn in the time thereof, my wine in the season thereof,
   and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.' God
   still retaineth the dominion of the creatures in his own hand, and we
   have but the stewardship and dispensation of them: he will give and he
   will take away at his own pleasure. They are deposited in our hands as
   a trust, for which we are accountable; therefore, if God demand, there
   should be an act of voluntary submission and subjection on our part If
   we enjoy them as our own, by an original right exclusive of God, we are
   usurpers but not just possessors. We have indeed a subordinate right to
   prevent the encroachment of our fellow-creatures, but that is but such
   a right as a man hath in a trust, or a servant to his working tools.
   Surely God may dispose of his own as he will. If we give it for God's
   glory, or lay out our wealth in his service, God's right must be owned:
   1 Chron. xxix. 14, For all things come of thee, and of thine own have
   we given thee.' If God take it away by immediate providence, it was his
   own: Job i. 21, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.' If by
   men, if we lose anything for God, it is his own that we lose.

   [3.] Our gain in Christ is more than our loss in the world, both here
   and hereafter. So his promise: Mark x. 29, 30, Verily I say unto you,
   there is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
   father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the
   gospel's, but he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses,
   and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
   persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.' Our religion
   promiseth us spiritual recompense in this world, and eternal in the
   other, but exempteth us not from persecutions. He that hath a heart to
   quit anything for Christ, shall have it abundantly recompensed in the
   world, with a reward much greater in value and worth than that which he
   hath forsaken, sometimes more and better in the same kind; as Job's
   estate was doubled, and Valentinian, that left the place of a tribune
   or captain of soldiers for his conscience, and got that of an emperor.
   If not this, he giveth them a greater portion of his Spirit and the
   graces thereof, more peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost,
   and this is a hundred-fold better than all that we lose. Now this we
   have with persecution: John xvi. 33, These things have I spoken unto
   you, that in me you might have peace; in the world you shall have
   tribulation.' But then, for the world to come, then all shall be
   abundantly made up to us in eternal life, when we shall reign with
   Christ in his heavenly kingdom. This is all in all to a Christian; that
   which is lost for God is not lost. Surely in heaven we shall have far
   better things than we lose here.

   [4.] Because the wicked never overcome but when they foil us of our
   innocency, zeal, and courage. The victory of a Christian doth not
   consist in not suffering, or not fighting, but in keeping that which we
   fight for: a Christian is more than a conqueror,' Rom. viii. 37. Scias
   hominem Christo deditum mori posse, vinci non posse. He may lose goods,
   lose life, yet still he overcomes whilst he is faithful to his duty.
   Those that were as sheep appointed to the slaughter,' and killed all
   the day long,' they were oppressed and kept under, yet were more than
   conquerors.' The way to conquer is by patience and zeal, though we be
   trodden down and ruined; not by getting the best of opposite factions,
   but by keeping a good conscience, and patience, and contentedness in
   sufferings. If God be honoured, if the kingdom of Christ be advanced by
   our sufferings, we are victorious: Rev. xii. 11, They overcame by the
   blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they loved
   not their lives unto the death.' That is an overcoming indeed, to die
   in the quarrel, and be the more glorious conquerors. As long as a
   Christian keepeth the faith, whatever he loses in the contest he has
   the best of it: 2 Tim. iv. 7, I have fought a good fight, I have
   finished my course, I have kept the faith,' &c. Our victory is not to
   be measured by our prosperity and adversity, but our faithful adherence
   to God. Though the devil and his instruments get their will over our
   bodies and bodily interests, yet if he get not his will over our souls,
   we conquer, and not Satan. Christians have not only to do with men who
   strike at their worldly interests, but with Satan, who hath a spite at
   their souls: Eph. vi. 12, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
   but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the
   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.'
   God may give men a power over the bodily lives of his people, and all
   the interests thereof; the devil aimeth at the destruction of souls. He
   will let you enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, that deprive you
   of your delight in God and celestial pleasures. He can be content you
   shall have dignities and honours if they prove a snare to you; if he
   seeketh to bring you to trouble and poverty, it is to draw you from
   God.

   [5.] Fainting argueth weakness, if not nullity of grace: Prov. xxiv.
   10, If thou faintest in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.' A
   zealous, constant mind will overcome all discouragements: 2 Tim. i. 7,
   For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love,
   and of a sound mind.' Trees, well rooted, will abide the blasts of
   strong winds. It is hard to those that are guided by flesh and blood to
   overcome such temptations, but to the heavenly mind it is more easy.

   Use 1. Of information.

   1. That loss of goods for adhering to God's word by the violence and
   rapine of evil-minded men is one temptation we should prepare for: such
   trials may come. Such as mind to be constant must prepare themselves to
   quit their goods. We all study to shift off the cross, but none
   studieth to prepare for the cross. Profession goeth at too low a rate
   when people leap into it upon the impulsion of carnal motives, or some
   light conviction or approbation. God taketh his fan in his hand, and
   the chaff is distinguished from the solid grain. All love ada'panon
   euange'lion, a cheap gospel: the gospel will have many summer friends,
   gaudy butterflies, that fly abroad in the sun shine; but what cost are
   we content to be at for the gospel's sake?

   2. That where men make conscience of their ways, they are not apt to be
   reduced by penalties, for they are guided by a higher principle than
   the interests of the flesh. Conscience looks to the obligation of duty,
   what we must do or not do; not to the course of our interests--not what
   is safe, but what is duty. Oh! but their sufferings may make them
   serious and wise, and so reflect upon their error, and change their
   mind. Ans. It rather puzzleth the case when a man is divided between
   his conscience and his interests. The unsound are blinded by their
   interests; but a gracious heart in a clear case is more resolute, in a
   doubtful is more afraid and full of hesitancy, lest he gratify the
   flesh, and so the case is more perplexed. Men sooner come to themselves
   and relinquish errors if interest be not in the case.

   Use 2. To exhort us to keep a good conscience, and to be faithful with
   God, though our temporal interests should be endangered thereby. The
   conscience of our duty should more comfort us than the loss of temporal
   things should trouble our minds. But because this is not a by-point
   that I am now upon, nor a small thing that I press you to, but
   necessary for every candidate of eternity or true disciple of Jesus
   Christ, I must direct to get this constancy of mind.

   1. I will show you what is necessary to it by way of disposition or
   qualification.

   2. What is necessary to it by way of consideration.

   1. By way of disposition.

   [1.] There is required a lively faith concerning the world to come,
   with some assurance of our interest therein. That faith is necessary to
   draw off the heart from the conveniences and comforts of this life
   appeareth by that, Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your
   goods, knowing of yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and a more
   enduring substance.' There is both faith implied, and also some
   assurance of our interest; they knew there was substance to be had in
   the other world. They that live by sense count present things only
   substance, but the world to come only fancy and shadows; but the
   gracious heart, on the contrary, looketh upon this world as a vain
   show,' Ps. xxxix. 6, the world to come to be only the enduring
   substance, or that true solid good which will make us everlastingly
   happy. And there is some assurance of our interest; they had this
   substance; that is, by virtue of God's promise they had a title and
   right to it, and some security for the full possession of it in due
   time, by the first fruits and earnest of the Spirit. This they knew in
   themselves; they discerned their own qualifications, and fulfilling the
   conditions of the promises; and the Spirit did in some measure testify
   to them that they were the sons of God; and from all this flowed their
   suffering of the loss of worldly goods, and their suffering of it
   joyfully.

   [2.] A sincere love to Christ is necessary, for then they will not quit
   his interest for what is most near and dear to them in the world: Rom.
   viii. 35, What shall separate us from the love of Christ?' Love there
   is not only taken passively, for the love wherewith Christ loveth us,
   but actively, for the love wherewith we love Christ. For the things
   mentioned there, tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
   or nakedness, or peril, or sword,' belong not to the latter; for
   tribulation is not wont to withdraw God from loving us, but us from
   loving God. It is we that are assaulted by tribulation, and not Go&lt;J
   nor Christ: it is our love which the temptation striketh at. A man that
   loveth Christ sincerely will be at some loss for him. Christ is rather
   held by the heart than by the head only. They that make a religion of
   their opinions will find no such effect, if they have a faith that
   never went deeper than their brains and their fancies, that reacheth
   not their heart, and doth not stir up their love to Christ, that will
   not enable them to hold out against temptations. Though men may
   sacrifice some of their weaker lusts and petty interests, yet they will
   not forsake all for his sake: he that loveth Christ will not leave him.
   Why doth a sinner deny himself for his lusts? he loveth them, and
   sacrifices his time, strength, estate, conscience. So a Christian that
   knoweth Christ hath loved him, and therefore loveth Christ again; he
   will not easily quit him and his truth. A bare belief is only in the
   head, which is but the entrance into the inwards of the soul; it is the
   heart which is Christ's castle and citadel. A superficial assent may
   let him go, but a faith which worketh by love produceth this close
   adherence. Well, if we would endure spoiling of our goods, it is our
   wisdom to consider what we love most, and can least part withal. Christ
   is infinitely to be valued, as more precious than all the wealth in the
   world.

   [3.] A well-grounded resolution in the truth: 1 Thes. v. 21, Prove all
   things; hold fast that which is good.' When we take up the ways of God
   upon fashion, or half conviction, or probable reasons, and do not
   resolve upon sound evidence, we are in danger to be shaken when it is a
   costly thing to be a sincere Christian; but when conscience is soundly
   informed, then all things give way to conscience. If the wicked spoil
   us of our goods, they should not spoil us of our best treasure, which
   is a good conscience. Whatever power they have by God's permission over
   our outward estates, they have no power over our consciences; that is
   the best friend or the worst enemy. No bird singeth so sweetly as the
   bird in our bosoms; here heaven or hell is begun, and the solaces of
   the outward life are nothing to this.

   [4.J A contempt of the world. Our earthly affections must be mortified,
   and that upon a twofold account:--

   (1.) That we may freely part with them; for if they be overvalued, our
   affliction will be according to the degree of our affection: Mark x.
   22, He was sad at that saying, and went away grieved, for he had great
   possessions.' We cannot so freely resign them to God, and leave all for
   treasure in heaven.

   (2.) That we may more entirely depend upon God: Heb. xiii. 5, Let your
   conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things
   as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave you nor forsake you.'
   Till the heart be purged from carnal affections, the promises of God
   have little force and respect with us. A little satisfieth a contented
   and a weaned mind, and he can the better cast himself upon God's
   providence.

   [5.] A sound belief of God's providence; this hath a great influence
   upon a free parting with our estates for our conscience' sake: Heb. xi.
   8, by faith Abraham left his country, kindred, possessions, and trusted
   himself blindfold with God's providence. This principle was made use of
   when the king was troubled about the hundred talents: 2 Chron. xxv. 9,
   saith the man of God, The Lord is able to give thee much more than
   this.' God's providence is enough for a gracious heart Indeed it is
   hard to maintain such a faith in providence when exposed to great
   injuries. We are apt to doubt of it; goodness seemeth to be neglected
   by him: Ps. lxxiii. 14, Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and
   washed my hands in innocency.' Doth God know? But a Christian must
   believe in hope against hope.

   2. Remedies by way of consideration.

   [1.] They cannot rob us of spiritual and eternal riches, of the fear of
   God, love of God; treasures in heaven are out of their reach: Mat. vi.
   19, 20, Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
   rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay
   up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
   corrupt, and where thieves do not break through or steal.' Your joy
   shall no man take from you,' John xvi. 22. Heavenly things can never be
   taken from their owners.

   [2.] If they cannot take away our God and Christ, we shall be certainly
   happy. All things in the world depend on God and Christ: The favour of
   the Lord maketh rich,' Prov. x. 22; without his blessing nothing
   prospereth. All judgment is in the hands of Christ, John v. 22. He hath
   the government of the world, or dominion over all things which may
   conduce to help or hinder his people's happiness. Things are not left
   to their arbitrament or uncertain contingency, but are under the
   government of a supreme providence, in the hand of him that loves us.

   [3.] Tried friendship is most valuable: James i. 12, Blessed is the man
   that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive the
   crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.'

   [4.] If we suffer with Christ, we shall also be glorified with him:
   Rom. viii. 17, If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also
   glorified together.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXX.

   At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, because of thy
   righteous judgments.--Ver. 62.

   IN these words observe three things:--

   1. David's holy employment, or the duty promised, giving thanks to God.

   2. His earnestness and fervency, implied in the time mentioned, at
   midnight I will rise; rather interrupt his sleep and rest than God
   should want his praise.

   3. The cause or matter of his thanksgiving, because of thy righteous
   judgments, whereby he meaneth the dispensations of his providence in
   delivering the godly and punishing the wicked according to his word.
   Where observe--

   1. The term by which these dispensations are expressed, judgments.

   2. The adjunct, righteous judgments.

   1. For the term, judgments,' they are so called partly because they are
   God's judicial acts belonging to his government of the world; partly
   because they are dispensed according to his word, the sentences of
   which are also called judgments. There are the judgments of his mouth
   and of his hand: Ps. cxix. 13, With my lips have I declared all the
   judgments of thy mouth.'

   2. The adjunct, righteous,' or the judgments of thy righteousness; so
   called because they are holy, just, and full of equity.

   Doct. 1. One special duty wherein the people of God should be much
   exercised is thanksgiving.

   Doct. 2. That, God's providence rightly considered, we shall in the
   worst times find much more cause to give thanks than to complain.

   Doct. 3. That a heart deeply affected with God's providence will take
   all occasions to praise God and give thanks to his name, both in season
   and out of season.

   Doct. 1. One special duty wherein the people of God should be much
   exercised is thanksgiving. This duty is often pressed upon us: Heb.
   xiii. 15, Let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually, which is
   the fruit of our lips;' giving thanks unto his name. There are two
   words there used, praise and thanksgiving: generally taken, they are
   the same; strictly taken, thanksgiving differeth from praise. They
   agree that we use our voice in thanksgiving, as we do also in praise,
   for they are both said to be the fruit of our lips. What is in the
   prophet Hosea, chap. xiv. 2, calves of our lips,' is in the Septuagint,
   the fruit of our lips:' and they both agree that they are a sacrifice
   offered to our supreme benefactor, or that they belong to the
   thank-offerings of the gospel. But they differ in that thanksgiving
   belongeth to benefits bestowed on ourselves or others; but in relation
   to us, praise to any excellency whatsoever. Thanksgiving may be in word
   or deed; praise in words only. Well, then, thanksgiving is a sensible
   acknowledgment of favours received, or an expression of our sense of
   them, by word and work, to the praise of the bestower. The object of it
   is the works of God as beneficial unto us, or to those who are related
   to us, or in whose good or ill we are concerned. As public persons, as
   magistrates: 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, I exhort, therefore, that, first of all,
   supplication, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for
   all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority.' Pastors of the
   church: 2 Cor. i. 11, You also helping together by prayer for us, that
   for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may
   be given by many on our behalf.' Or our kindred according to the flesh,
   or some bond of Christian duty: Rom. xii. 15, Rejoice with them that do
   rejoice.' Another place where this duty is enforced is Eph. v. 20,
   where we are bidden to give thanks always for all things unto God and
   the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;' where you see it is a
   duty of a universal and perpetual use, and one wherein the honour of
   God and Christ is much concerned. A third place is 1 Thes. v. 18, In
   everything give thanks, for this is the will of, God in Christ Jesus
   concerning you.' See what reason he urgeth; the express will of God
   requiring this worship at our hands. We are to obey intuitu voluntatis.
   God's will is the fundamental reason of our obedience in every
   commandment; but here is a direct charge, now God hath made known the
   wonders of his love in Christ.

   I shall prove to you that this is a necessary duty, a profitable duty,
   a pleasant and delightful duty.

   1. The necessity of being much and often in thanksgiving will appear by
   these two considerations:--

   [1.] Because God is continually beneficial to us, blessing and
   delivering his people every day, and by new mercies giveth us new
   matter of praise and thanksgiving: Ps. lxviii. 19, Blessed be the God
   of our salvation, who loadeth us daily with his benefits, Selah.' He
   hath continually favoured us and preserved us, and poured his benefits
   upon us. The mercies of every day make way for songs which may sweeten
   our rest in the night; and his giving us rest by night, and preserving
   us in our sleep, when we could not help ourselves, giveth us songs in
   the morning. And all the day long we find new matter of praise: our
   whole work is divided between receiving and acknowledging.

   [2.] Some mercies are so general and beneficial that they should never
   be forgotten, but remembered before God every day. Such as redemption
   by Christ: Ps. cxi. 4, He hath made his wonderful works to be
   remembered.' We must daily be blessing God for Jesus Christ: 2 Cor. ix.
   15, Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.' I understand it of
   his grace by Christ. We should ever be thus blessing and praising him;
   for the keeping of his great works in memory is the foundation of all
   love and service to God.

   2. It is a profitable duty. The usefulness of thanksgiving appeareth
   with respect to faith, love, and obedience.

   [1.] With respect to faith. Faith and praise live and die together; if
   there be faith, there will be praise; and if there be praise, there
   will be faith. If faith, there will be praise, for faith is a bird that
   can sing in winter: Ps. lvi. 4, In God will I praise his word, in God
   have I put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me:' and
   ver. 10, In God I will praise his word, in the Lord I will praise his
   word." Hi's word is satisfaction enough to a gracious heart; if they
   have his word, they can praise him beforehand, for the grounds of hope
   before they have enjoyment. As Abraham, when he had not a foot in the
   land of Canaan, yet built an altar and offered sacrifices of thanks
   giving, because of God's grant and the future possession in his
   posterity, Gen. xiii. 18. Then, whether he punisheth or pitieth, we
   will praise him and glory in him. Faith entertaineth the promise before
   performance cometh, not only with confidence, but with delight and
   praise. The other part is, if praise, there will be faith; that is,
   supposing the praise real, for it raiseth our faith to expect the like
   again, having received so much grace already. All God's praises are the
   believer's advantage, the mercy is many times given as a pledge of more
   mercy. In many cases Deus donando debet. If life, he will give food and
   bodily raiment. It holdeth good in spiritual things. If Christ, other
   things with Christ. One concession draweth another; if he spares me, he
   will feed me, clothe me. The attributes from whence the mercy cometh is
   the pillar of the believer's confidence and hope. If such a good, then
   a fit object of trust. If I have found him a God hearing prayer, I will
   call upon him as long as I live,' Ps. cxvi. 2. Praise doth but provide
   matter of trust, and represent God to us as a storehouse of all good
   things, and a sure foundation for dependence.

   [2.] The great respect it hath to love. Praise and thanksgiving is an
   act of love, and then it cherisheth and feedeth love. It is an act of
   love to God, for if we love God we will praise him. Prayer is a work of
   necessity, but praise a mere work of duty and respect to God. We would
   exalt him more in our own hearts and in the hearts of others: Ps. lxxi.
   14, I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.'
   We pray because we need God, and we praise him because we love him.
   Self-love will put us upon prayer, but the love of God upon praise and
   thanksgiving; then we return to give him the glory. Those that seek
   themselves will cry to him in their distress; but those that love God
   cannot endure that he should be without his due honour. In heaven, when
   other graces and duties cease, which belong to this imperfect state, as
   faith and repentance cease, yet love remaineth; and because love
   remaineth, praise remaineth, which is our great employment in the other
   world. So it feedeth and cherisheth love, for every benefit
   acknowledged is a new fuel to keep in the fire: Ps. xviii. 1, I will
   love thee, O Lord, my strength;' Ps. cxvi. 1, I will love the Lord, who
   hath heard the voice of my supplications:' Deut. xx-x. 20, That thou
   mayest love the Lord, who is thy life, and the length of thy days.' The
   soul by praise is filled with a sense of the mercy and goodness of God,
   so that hereby he is made more amiable to us.

   [3.] With respect to submission and obedience to his laws and
   providence.

   (1.) His laws. The greatest bond of duty upon the fallen creature is
   gratitude. Now grateful we cannot be without a sensible and explicit
   acknowledgment of his goodness to us: the more frequent and serious in
   that, the more doth our love constrain us to devote ourselves to God:
   Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
   that you present yourselves a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to
   God, which is your reasonable service.' To live to him: 2 Cor. v. 14,
   15, For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that
   if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that
   they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   him which died for them, and rose again.' And therefore praise and
   thanksgiving is a greater help to the spiritual life than we are
   usually aware of; for, working in us a sense of God's love, and an
   actual remembrance of his benefits (as it will do if rightly
   performed), it doth make us shy of sin, more careful and solicitous to
   do his will. Shall we offend so good a God? God's love to us is a love
   of bounty; our love to God is a love of duty, when we grudge not to
   live in subjection to him: 1 John v. 3, His commandments are not
   grievous.'

   (2.) Submission to his providence. There is a querulous and sour spirit
   which is natural to us, always repining and murmuring at God's dealing,
   and wasting and vexing our spirits in heartless complaints. Now, this
   fretting, quarrelling, impatient humour, which often showeth itself
   against God even in our prayers and supplications, is quelled by
   nothing so much as by being frequent in praises and thanksgivings: Job
   i. 21, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
   the name of the Lord.' It is an act of holy prudence in the saints,
   when they are under any trouble, to strain themselves to the quite
   contrary duty of what temptations and corruptions would drive them
   unto. When the temptation is laid to make us murmur and swell at God's
   dealings, we should on the contrary bless and give thanks. And
   therefore the Psalmist doth so frequently sing praises in the saddest
   condition. There is no perfect defeating the temptation but by studying
   matter of praise, and to set seriously about the duty. So Job ii. 10,
   Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
   evil?' Shall we receive so many proofs of the love of God, and quarrel
   at a few afflictions that come from the same hand, and rebel against
   his providence when he bringeth on some needful trouble for our trial
   and exercise? and having tasted so much of his bounty and love, repine
   and fret at every change of dealing, though it be useful to purge out
   our corruptions, and promote our communion with God? Surely nothing can
   be extremely evil that cometh from this good hand. As we receive good
   things cheerfully and contentedly, so must we receive evil things
   submissively and patiently.

   3. It is a most delightful work to remember the many thousand mercies
   God hath bestowed on the church, ourselves, and friends. To remember
   his gracious word and all the passages of his providence; is this
   burdensome to us? Ps. cxlvii. 1, Praise ye the Lord, for it is
   pleasant:' and Ps. cxxxv. 3, Sing praises unto his name, for it is
   pleasant' Next to necessity, profit; next to profit, pleasure. No
   necessity so great as spiritual necessity, because our eternal
   well-being or ill-being dependeth on it; and beggary is nothing to
   being found naked in the great day. No profit so great as spiritual;
   that is not to be measured by the good things of this world, or a
   little pelf, or the great mammon, which so many worship; but some
   spiritual and divine benefit, which tendeth to make us spiritually
   better, more like God, more capable of communion with him; that is true
   profit, it is an increase of faith, love, and obedience. So for
   pleasure and delight; that which truly exhilarateth the soul, begets
   upon us a solid impression of God's love, that is the true pleasure.
   Carnal pleasures are unwholesome for you, like luscious fruits, which
   make you sick. Nothing is so hard of digestion as carnal pleasures.
   This feedeth the flesh, warreth against the soul; but this holy delight
   that resulteth from the serious remembrance of God, and setting forth
   his excellences and benefits, is safe and healthful, and doth cheer us
   but not hurt us.

   Use. Oh, then, let us be oftener in praising and giving thanks to God!
   Can you receive so much, and beg so much, and never think of a return
   or any expression of gratitude? Is there such a being as God, have you
   all your supplies from him, and will you not take some time to
   acknowledge what he hath done for your souls? Either you must deny his
   being, and then you are atheists; or you must deny his providence, and
   then you are epicureans, next door to atheism; or you must deny such a
   duty as praise and thanksgiving, and then you are anti-scripturists,
   for the scripture everywhere calleth for it at our hands; or else, if
   you neglect this duty, you live in flat contradiction to what you
   profess to believe, and then you are practical atheists, and practical
   epicureans, and practical anti-scripturists; and so your condemnation
   will be the greater, because you own the truth but deny the practice. I
   beseech you, therefore, to be often alone with God, and that in a way
   of thanksgiving, to increase your love, faith, and obedience, and
   delight in God. Shall I use arguments to you?

   1. Have you received nothing from God? I put this question to you,
   because great is our unthankfulness, not only for common benefits, but
   also for special deliverances--the one not noted and observed, the
   other not improved. Humble persons will find matter of praise in very
   common benefits, but we forget even signal mercies. Therefore, I say,
   have you received nothing? Now, consider, is there no return due? You
   know the story, Luke xvii. 15-19, Christ healed ten lepers, and but one
   of them returned and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down at
   his feet giving thanks, and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering
   said, Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine? There are
   not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And
   he said unto him, Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.'
   All had received a like benefit, but one only returned, and he a
   Gentile and no Jew, to acknowledge the mercy. They were made whole by a
   miraculous providence, he was made whole by a more gracious
   dispensation: Thy faith hath made thee whole;' he was dismissed with a
   special blessing. God scattereth his benefits upon all mankind, but how
   few own the supreme benefactor! Surely a sensible heart seeth always
   new occasions of praising God, and some old occasions that must always
   be remembered, always for life, and peace, and safety, and daily
   provision; and always for Christ, and the hopes of eternal life. Surely
   if we have the comfort, God should have the glory: Ps. xcvi. 8, Give
   unto the Lord the glory due unto his name, bring an offering, and come
   into his courts.' He that hath scattered his seed expecteth a crop from
   you.

   2. How disingenuous is it to be always craving, and never giving
   thanks! It is contrary to his directions in the word; for he showeth us
   there that all our prayers should be mingled with a thankful sense and
   acknowledgment of his mercies: Phil. iv. 6, In everything let your
   requests and supplications be made known with thanksgiving.' Do not
   come only in a complaining way: Col. iv. 2, Continue in prayer, and
   watch in the same with thanksgiving.' They are not holy requests unless
   we acknowledge what he hath done for us, as well as desire him to do
   more. Nothing more usual than to come in our necessities to seek help;
   but we do not return, when we have received help and relief, to give
   thanks. When our turn is served, we neglect God Wants urge us more than
   blessings, our interest swayeth us more than duty. As a dog swalloweth
   every bit that is cast to him, and still looketh for more, we swallow
   whatever the bounty of God casteth out to us without thanks, and when
   we need again, we would have more, and though warm in petitions, yet
   cold, rare, infrequent in gratulations. It is not only against
   scripture, but against nature. Ethnics abhor the ungrateful, that were
   still receiving, but forgetting to give thanks. It is against justice
   to seek help of God, and when we have it to make no more mention of God
   than if we had it from ourselves. It is against truth; we make many
   promises in our affliction, but forget all when well at ease.

   3. God either takes away or blasts the mercies which we are not
   thankful for. Sometimes he taketh them from us: Hosea ii. 8, 9, I will
   take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season
   thereof, and I will recover my wool and flax.' Why? She doth not know
   that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and gave her silver and gold.'
   Where his kindness is not taken notice of, nor his hand seen and
   acknowledged, he will take his benefits to himself again. We know not
   the value of mercies so much by their worth as by their want; o'sper
   o'phthalmoi to` a'gan lampro`n ouk orosi--a thing too near the eye
   cannot be seen. God must set things at a distance to make us value
   them. If he take them not away, yet many times he blasts them as to
   their natural use: Mal. ii. 2, And if you will not hear, and if you
   will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, saith the Lord of
   hosts, 1 will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your
   blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it
   to heart.' The creature is a deaf-nut; when we come to crack it, we
   have not the natural blessing as to health, strength, and cheerfulness,
   Acts xiv. 17; or if food, yet not gladness of heart with it; or we have
   not the sanctified use, it is not a mercy that leadeth us to God. A
   thing is sanctified when it is a bono in bonum, if it cometh from God
   and leadeth us to God: 1 Cor. iii. 21-23, All things are yours; whether
   Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
   present, or things to come, all are yours, for you are Christ's, and
   Christ is God's.' You have a covenant right, a holy use.

   4. Bless him for favours received, and you shall have more. Thanks
   giving is the kindly way of petitioning, and the more thankful for
   mercies, the more they are increased upon us. Vapours drawn up from the
   earth return in showers to the earth again. The sea poureth out its
   fulness into the rivers, and all rivers return to the sea from whence
   they came: Ps. lxvii. 5, 6, Let the people praise thee, O God; yea, let
   all the people praise thee: then shall the earth yield her increase,
   and God, even our own God, shall bless us.' When springs lie low, we
   pour a little water into the pump, not to enrich the fountain, but to
   bring up more for ourselves. It is not only true of outward increase,
   but of spiritual also: Col. ii. 7, Be ye rooted in the faith, and
   abound therein with thanksgiving.' If we give thanks for so much grace
   as we have already received, it is the way to increase our store. We
   thrive no more, get no more victory over our corruptions, because we do
   no more give thanks.

   5. When God's common mercies are well observed or well improved, it
   fits us for acts of more special kindness. In the story of the
   lepers--Luke xvii. 19, Thy faith hath made thee whole,'--he met not
   only with a bodily cure, but a soul cure: Luke xvi. 11, If, therefore,
   ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to
   your trust the true riches?' When we suspect a vessel leaketh, we try
   it with water before we fill it with wine. You are upon your trial; be
   thankful for less, God will give you more. Means or directions:--

   [1.] Heighten all the mercies you have by all the circumstances
   necessary to be considered. By the nature and kind of them: spiritual
   eternal blessings first; the greatest mercies deserve greatest
   acknowledgment: Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in Christ'--Christ's spirit, pardon of sins, heaven,
   the way of salvation known, accepted, and the things of the world as
   subordinate helps. Luke x. 20, Notwithstanding in this rejoice not,
   that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your
   names are written in heaven.' Then consider your sense in the want of
   mercies; what high thoughts had you then of them? The mercies are the
   same when you have them and when you want them, only your apprehensions
   are greater. If affectionately begged they must be affectionately
   acknowledged, else you are a hypocrite either in the supplication or
   gratulation. Consider the person giving, God, so high and glorious. A
   small remembrance from a great prince, no way obliged, no way needing
   me, to whom I can be no way profitable, a small kindness melts us, a
   gift of a few pounds, a little parcel of land. Do I court him and
   observe him? There is less reason why God should abase himself to look
   upon us or concern himself in us: Ps. cxiii. 6, He humbleth himself to
   behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth.' We have all
   things from him. Consider the person receiving; so unworthy: Gen. xxxii
   10, I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the
   truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant;' 2 Sam. vii. 18, Who am
   I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
   hitherto?' Consider the season; our greatest extremity is God's
   opportunity: Gen. xxii. 14, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen,'
   when the knife was at the throat of his son; 2 Cor. i. 9, 10, We had
   the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
   ourselves, but in God, which raiseth the dead, who delivered us from so
   great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust, that he will yet
   deliver us.' Consider the end and fruit of his mercy; it is to manifest
   his special love to us, and engage our hearts to himself: Isa. xxxviii.
   17, Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of
   corruption,' or thou hast loved me from the grave;' otherwise God may
   give things in anger. Consider the means by which he brought them
   about, when unlikely, unexpected in themselves, weak, insufficient. The
   greatest matters of providence hang many times upon small wires: a lie
   brought Joseph into prison, and a dream fetched him out, and he was
   advanced, and Jacob's family fed. Consider the number of his mercies:
   Ps. cxxxix. 17, How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how
   great is the sum of them!' The many failings pardoned, comforts
   received, dangers prevented, deliverances vouchsafed. How he began with
   us before all time, conducted us in time, and hath been preparing for
   us a happiness which we shall enjoy when time shall be no more.

   [2.] Satisfy yourselves with no praise and thanksgiving but what
   leaveth the impression of real effects upon the soul; for God is not
   flattered with empty praises and a little verbal commendation. There is
   a twofold praising of God--by expressive declaration or by objective
   impression. Now, neither expression nor impression must be excluded.
   Some platonical divines explode and scoff at the verbal praise more
   than becometh their reverence to the word of God: Ps. l. 23, He that
   offereth praise glorifieth me.' But then the impression must be looked
   after too, that we be like that God whom we commend and extol, that we
   depend on him more, love him more fervently, serve him more cheerfully.

   Doct. 2. That God's providence rightly considered, we shall find in the
   worst times much more cause to give thanks than to complain. I observe
   this because David was now under affliction. He had in the former verse
   complained that the bands of the wicked had robbed him,' yet even then
   would he give thanks to God.

   1. Observe here, the matter of his thanksgiving was God's providence
   according to his word, seen in executing threatenings on the wicked,
   and performing his promises to the godly. God's word is one of the
   chiefest benefits bestowed on man, and therefore should be a subject of
   our praises. Now, when this is verified in his providence, and we see a
   faithful performance of those things in mercy to his servants, and in
   justice to his enemies, and the benefits and advantages of his law to
   them that are obedient, and the just punishment of the disobedient, and
   can discern not only a vein of righteousness but of truth in all God's
   dealings, this is a double benefit, which must be taken notice of, and
   acknowledged to God's praise. O Christians! how sweet is it to read his
   works by the light of the sanctuary, and to learn the interpretation of
   his providence from his Spirit by his word: Ps. lxxiii. 17, I went into
   the sanctuary of God, then understood I their end;' by consulting the
   scriptures he see the end and close of them that walk not according to
   God's direction: his word and works do mutually explain one another.
   The sanctuary is the place where God's people meet, where his word is
   taught, where we may have satisfaction concerning all his dealings.

   2. That when any divine dispensation goeth cross to our affections,
   yea, our prayers and expectations, yet even then can faith bring meat
   out of the eater, and find many occasions of praise and thanksgiving to
   God; for nothing falleth out so cross but we may see the hand of God in
   it working for good.

   [1.] Though we have not the blessing we seek and pray for, yet we give
   thanks because God hath been sometimes entreated, he hath showed
   himself a God hearing prayer, and is only delaying now until a more fit
   time wherein he may give us that which is sought: Ps. xliii. 5, Hope
   thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
   countenance, and my God.' Now we are mourning, but he is our God, and
   we are not left without hope of a blessed issue. God, that hath been
   gracious, will be gracious again. He is our gracious father when we are
   under his sharpest corrections, a father when he striketh or frowneth;
   therefore we are not without hope that he will give us opportunities
   again of glorifying his name.

   [2.] We bless God for continuing so long the mercies which he hath
   taken from us. Former experiences must not be forgotten: Ebenezer,
   hitherto the Lord hath helped us.' If he shall afflict us afterward,
   yet hitherto he hath helped us,' 1 Sam. vii. 12. If he take away life,
   it is a mercy that he spared it so long for his own service and glory;
   if liberty, that we had such a time of rest and intermission.

   [3.] God is yet worthy of praise and thanksgiving for choicer mercies
   yet continued, notwithstanding all the afflictions laid upon us. That
   we have his Spirit supporting us under our trials, and enabling us to
   bear them: 1 Peter iv. 13, 14, Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of
   Christ's sufferings; that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
   glad also with exceeding joy. For if ye be reproached for the name of
   Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth on
   you.' And that we have any peace of conscience: Rom. v. 1, Therefore,
   being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.' That the hope of eternal life is not diminished but increased
   by our afflictions: Rom. v. 4, 5, We glory in tribulation, knowing that
   tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience
   hope, and hope maketh not ashamed: because the love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.' That
   many of our natural comforts are yet left, and God will supply us by
   ways best known to himself.

   [4.] That evils and afflictions which light upon us for the gospel's
   sake, or righteousness' sake, and Christ's name's sake, are to be
   reckoned among our privileges, and deserve praise rather than
   complaint: Phil. i. 29, To you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not
   only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.' If it be a
   gift, it is matter of praise.

   [5.] Take these evils in the worst notion, they are less than we have
   deserved: Ezra ix. 13, And after all that is come upon us for our evil
   deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast
   punished us less than our iniquities deserve.' Babylon is not hell, and
   still that should be acknowledged.

   [6.] That no evil hath befallen us but such as God can bring good out
   of them: Rom. viii. 28, All things shall work together for good to them
   that love God.' All things that befall a Christian are either good, or
   shall turn to good; either to good natural: Gen. l. 20, Ye thought
   evil, but God meant it for good;' or good spiritual: Ps. cxix. 75, I
   know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
   faithfulness hast afflicted me;' or good eternal: 2 Cor. iv. 17, For
   our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.'

   Use 1. For information, that God's righteous judgments are matter of
   praise and thanksgiving. An angel is brought in speaking, Rev. xvi. 5,
   Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shaft be, because
   thou hast judged thus.' Indeed, the formal object of thanksgiving and
   praise is some benefit: Ps. cxxxv. 3, Praise the Lord, for the Lord is
   good.' We praise God for his judgments, because they are just and
   right; we praise God for his mercies, not only because they are just
   and equal, but comfortable and beneficial to us, and so a double ground
   of thanksgiving.

   Use 2. For reproof, that we make more noise of a little trouble than we
   do of a thousand benefits that remain with us. We fret and complain and
   manifest the impatiency of the flesh; like a great machine or carriage,
   if one pin be out of order, all stoppeth, or one member hurt, though
   all the rest of the body be sound; or as Haman, the favours of a great
   king, pleasures of a luxurious court, all this availeth him nothing as
   long as Mordecai was in the gate, Esther v. 13; not withstanding his
   riches, honours, multitude of children, great offices, this damped all
   his joy: Mal. i. 2, I have loved you, saith the Lord; yet ye say,
   Wherein hast thou loved us?' Non quod habet numerat, &c. Oh! let us
   check this complaining spirit; let us consider what is left, not what
   God hath taken away; what we may or shall have, not what we now want;
   what God is, and will be to his people, though we see little or nothing
   in the creature.

   Doct. 3. That a heart deeply affected with God's providence will take
   all occasions to praise and give thanks.

   1. It is certain that our whole life should be a real expression of
   thankfulness to God. The life of a Christian is a life of love and
   praise, a hymn to God: 1 Peter ii. 9, But ye are a chosen gene ration,
   a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should
   show forth the praises of him who hath called you but of darkness into
   his marvellous light.' Christianity is a confession; the visible acting
   of godliness is a part of this confession; we are all saved as
   confessors or martyrs. Now the confession is made both in word and
   deed.

   2. There are special occasions of thanksgiving and praise to God, as
   the apostle bids Timothy preach: 2 Tim. iv. 2, eukai'ros akai'ros, in
   season, out of season,' meaning thereby that he should not only take
   ordinary occasions, but extraordinary; he should make an opportunity
   where he found none. So we should press Christians to praise God not
   only in solemn duties, when the saints meet together to praise, but
   extraordinarily redeem time for this blessed work; yea, interrupt our
   lawful sleep and repose, to find frequent vacancies for so necessary a
   duty as the lauding and magnifying of God's mercy.

   3. As for rising up at midnight, we can neither enforce it as a duty
   upon you, nor yet can we condemn it. It was an act of heroical zeal in
   David, who employed his time waking to the honour of God, which others
   spent in sleeping; and we read that Paul and Silas sang praises at
   midnight,' Acts xvi. 25, though then in the stocks, and they had been
   scourged the day before. And it is said, Job xxxv. 10, None saith,
   Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night?' that is, giveth
   matter of praise if we wake in the night. And David saith elsewhere,
   Ps. xlii. 8, The Lord will command his lovingkindness in the day-time,
   and in the night his song shall be with me:' day and night he would be
   filled with a sense of God's love, and with songs of praise. Therefore
   we cannot condemn this, but must highly commend it. Let men praise God
   at any time, and the more they deny themselves to do it, the more
   commendable is the action; yet we cannot enforce it upon you as a
   necessary duty, as the Papists build their nocturnal devotions upon it.
   That which we disapprove in them is, that those hours instituted by men
   they make necessary; that they direct their prayers to saints and
   angels which should only be to God, that they might mingle them with
   superstitious ceremonies and, observances; that they pray and sing in
   an unknown tongue without devotion, appropriating it to a certain sort
   of men, to clerks for their gain, with an opinion of merit. The
   primitive Christians had their hymnos antelucanos, but in persecution,
   their alektrophoni'as, saith Clem. Alexandrinus; but what is this to
   superstitious night-services?

   4. Though we cannot enforce the particular observance upon you, yet
   there are many notable lessons to be drawn from David's practice.

   [1.] The ardency of his devotion, or his earnest desire to praise God,
   at midnight:' then, when sleep doth most invade us, then he would rise
   up. His heart was so set upon the praising of God, and the sense of his
   righteous providence did so affect him, and urge him, or excite him to
   this duty, that he would not only employ himself in this work in the
   day-time, and so show his love to God, but he would rise out of his bed
   to worship God and celebrate his praise. That which hindereth the sleep
   of ordinary men is either the cares of this world, the impatient
   resentment of injuries, or the sting of an evil conscience: these keep
   others waking, but David was awaked by a desire to praise God; no hour
   is unseasonable to a gracious heart; he is expressing his affection to
   God when others take their rest. Thus we read of our Lord Christ, that
   he spent whole nights in prayer, Luke vi. 12. It is said of the
   glorified saints in heaven, that they praise God continually: Rev. vii.
   17, They are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in
   his temple, and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.'
   Now, holy men, though much hindered by their bodily necessities, yet
   they will come as near as present frailty will permit; we oftentimes
   begin the day with some fervency of prayer and praise, but we faint ere
   even.

   [2.] His sincerity, seen in his secrecy. David would profess his faith
   in God when he had no witness by him, at midnight, then no hazard of
   ostentation. It was a secret cheerfulness and delighting in God when
   alone; he could have no respect to the applause of men, but only to
   approve himself to God who seeth in secret. See Christ's direction,
   Mat. vi. 6, But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and
   when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret,
   and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly:' his own
   practice: Mark i. 35, Rising early in the morning, he went into a
   desert to pray.' Both time and place implied secrecy.

   [3.] We learn hence the preciousness of time. It was so to David. See
   how he spendeth the time of his life. We read of David, when he lay
   down at night, he watered his couch with his tears,' after the
   examination of his heart; Ps. cxix. 62; at midnight he rose to give
   thanks; in the morning he prevented the morning-watches, seven times
   a-day praising God, morning, noon, night. These are all acts of eminent
   piety. We should not content ourselves with so much grace as will
   merely serve to save us. Alas! we have much idle time hanging upon our
   hands; if we would give that to God it were well.

   [4.] The value of godly exercises above our natural refreshings; the
   word is sweeter than appointed food: Job xxiii. 12, I have esteemed the
   words of his mouth more than my necessary food.' David preferreth his
   praises of God before his sleep and rest in the night. Surely this
   should shame us for our sensuality. We can dispense with other things
   for our vain pleasures; we have done as much for sin, for vain sports,
   broken our rest for sin. Some monsters of mankind turn night into day,
   and day into night for their drunkenness, gaming, vain sports, &c., and
   shall we not deny ourselves for God?

   [5.] The reverence to be used in secret adoration. David did not only
   raise up his spirits to praise God, but rise up out of his bed to bow
   the knee to him. Secret duties should be performed with some solemnity,
   not slubbered over. Praise, a special act of adoration, requireth the
   worship of body and soul

   Use. Let David's example condemn our backwardness and sluggishness, who
   will not take those occasions which offer themselves. Mark, lie gave
   thanks when we fret; at midnight he rose to do it with the more secrecy
   and fervency; this not to pray only, but to give thanks.

SERMON LXXI.

   I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy
   precepts.--Ver. 63.

   IN this verse two things are observable:--

   1. A description of the people of God; they are described by their
   principle, and by the course of their lives and actions, fear and
   obedience.

   2. David's respect to them, I am a companion of all them.

   More particularly:--

   1. In the person speaking: the disparity of the persons is to be
   observed. David, who was a great prophet, yea, a king, yet saith, I am
   a companion of them that fear thee.' Christ himself called them his
   fellows:' Ps. xlv. 7, Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of
   gladness above thy fellows; and therefore David might well say, I am a
   companion.'

   2. David saith of all them. The universal particle is to be observed;
   not only some, but all: when any lighted upon him, or he upon any of
   them, they were welcome to him. How well would it be for the world if
   the great potentates of the earth would thus think, speak, and do: I am
   a companion of all them that fear thee.' Self-love reigneth in most
   men. We love the rich and despise the poor, and so have the faith of
   our Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons,' James ii. 1; therefore
   this universality is to be regarded. Hearing of your faith and love to
   all the saints,' Eph. i. 15, to the mean, as well as the greatest.
   Meanness doth not take away church relations, 1 Cor. xi. 20. There are
   many differences in worldly respects between one child of God and
   another, yea, in spiritual gifts, some weaker, some stronger, but we
   must love all, for all are children of one Father, all owned by Christ,
   He is not ashamed to call them brethren,' Heb. ii. 11. This, I say, is
   observable, the disparity of the persons--on the one side David, on the
   other all the people of God.

   First, Let us take notice of the description of the people of God. They
   are such as fear him and keep his precepts, that is, obey him
   conscientiously, out of reverence to his majesty and goodness, and due
   regard to his will delivered in his word. The same description is used:
   Acts x. 35, In every nation he that feareth God and worketh
   righteousness is accepted with him.' Note hence--

   Doct. 1. The fear of God is the grand principle of obedience: Deut. v.
   29, Oh, that there were such an heart within them, that they would fear
   me and keep my commandments always.' Here consider--

   1. What is the fear of God.

   2. What influence it hath upon obedience.

   1. What is the fear of God? There is a twofold fear of God--servile and
   filial.

   [1.] Servile, by which a man feareth God and hateth him, as a slave
   feareth his cruel master, whom he could wish dead, and himself rid of
   his service, and obeyeth by mere compulsion and constraint. Thus the
   wicked fear God because they have drawn an ill picture of him in their
   minds: Mat. xxv. 24, 25, I knew thou wast a hard man, and I was
   afraid.' They perform only a little unwilling and unpleasing service,
   and as little as they can, because of their ill conceit of God. So Adam
   feared God after his sin when he ran away from him, Gen. iii. 10. Yea,
   so the devils fear God, and rebel against him: James ii. 29, The devils
   also believe and tremble.' This fear hath torment in it to the
   creature, and hatred of God, because by the fear of his curse and the
   flames of hell he seeketh to drive them from sin.

   [2.] Filial fear, as children fear to offend their dear parents; and
   thus the godly do so fear God, that they do also love him, and obey
   him, and cleave to him, and this preserveth us in our duty: Jer. xxxii.
   40, I will put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from
   me.' This is a necessary frame of heart for all those that would
   observe and obey God. This fear is twofold:--

   (1.) The fear of reverence.

   (2.) The fear of caution.

   (1.) The fear of reverence, when the soul is deeply possessed with a
   sense of God's majesty and goodness, that it dareth not offend him. His
   greatness and majesty hath an influence upon this fear. Fear ye not me?
   saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the
   sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot
   pass it?' Jer. v. 22. His goodness and mercy: Hosea iii. 5, They shall
   fear the Lord, and his goodness;' Jer. x. 6, 7, There is none like unto
   thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might: who would
   not fear thee, O king of nations?' Both together engage us to live
   always as in his eye and presence, and in the obedience of his holy
   will, studying to please him in all things.

   (2.) The fear of caution is also called the fear of God, when we carry
   on the business of salvation with all possible solicitude and care. For
   it is no easy thing to please God and save our souls: Phil. ii. 12,
   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.' In the time of our
   sojourning here we meet with many temptations; baits without are many,
   and the flesh within us is importunate to be pleased, and our account
   at the end of the journey is very exact: 1 Peter i. 17, And if ye call
   on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to
   every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.' A
   false heart is apt to betray us, and the entertainments of sense to
   entice and corrupt us, and we are assaulted on every side, and
   salvation and eternal happiness is the thing in chase and pursuit; if
   we come short of it we are undone for ever: Heb. iv. 1, Having a
   promise of rest left with us, let us fear lest we come short of it.'
   There is no mending errors in the other world; there we shall be
   convinced of our mistakes to our confusion, but not to our conversion
   and salvation.

   2. The influence it hath upon keeping God's precepts.

   [1.] In general, this is one demonstration of it, that the most eminent
   servants of God have been commended for their fear of God: Job, chap.
   i. 1, is said to be a man perfect and upright, one that feared God, and
   eschewed evil.' He had a true godliness, or a filial awe of God, which
   kept him from sin, and the temptations whereby it might insinuate
   itself into his soul. So Obadiah, Ahab's steward, is described to be a
   man that feared God greatly,' 1 Kings xviii. 3; and of one Hananiah it
   is said, Neh. vii. 2, that he feared God greatly, above many others.'
   Men are more holy as the fear of God doth more prevail in their hearts,
   their tenderness both in avoiding and repenting of sin increaseth
   according as they entertain the awe and fear of God in their hearts,
   and here is the rise and fountain of all circumspect walking. As the
   stream is dried up that wanteth a fountain, so godliness ceaseth as the
   fear of God abateth.

   [2.] More particularly.

   (1.) It is the great pull-back and constant preservative of the soul
   against ski, as the beasts are contained in their subjection and
   obedience to man by the fear that is upon them: Gen. vii. 2, The dread
   of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, that they shall not hurt
   you;' so the fear of God is upon us: Exod. xx. 20, God is come to prove
   you, that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.' Joseph
   is an instance: Gen. xxxix. 9, How can I do this great wickedness, and
   sin against God?' Abraham could promise himself little security in a
   place where no fear of God was: Gen. xx. 11, I thought surely the fear
   of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake.'
   Therefore, Prov. xxiii. 17, Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day
   long.'

   (2.) It is the great excitement to obedience.

   (1st.) Duties of religion will not reverently and seriously be
   performed unless there be a deep awe of God upon our souls: God will be
   sanctified in all that draw nigh unto him,' Lev. x. 3. Now, what is it
   to sanctify God in our hearts, but to fear his majesty and greatness
   and goodness? Isa. viii. 13, Sanctify the Lord God of hosts in your
   hearts, and make him your fear.' Therefore David desireth God to call
   in his straggling thoughts and scattered affections: Ps. lxxxvi. 11,
   Unite my heart to the fear of thy name;' so the serious worshippers are
   described to be those that desire to fear his name,' Neh. i. 11.

   (2d.) Duties towards men will not be regarded in all times and places,
   unless the fear of God bear rule in our hearts; as servants, when their
   masters are absent, neglect their work: Col. iii. 22, Servants, obey in
   all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service,
   as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.' A Christian
   is alike everywhere, because God is alike everywhere. He that feareth
   God needeth no other theatre than his own conscience, nor other
   spectators than God and his holy angels. So to hinder us from
   contriving mischief in secret, when others are not aware of it: Lev.
   xix. 14, Thou shalt not curse the deaf man, nor lay a stumbling-block
   before the blind, but shalt fear the Lord thy God.' The deaf hear not,
   the blind seeth not; but God seeth and heareth, and that is enough to a
   gracious heart to bridle us when it is in our power to hurt others; as
   Joseph assureth his brethren he would be just to them, for I fear God,'
   Gen. xlii. 18. Nehemiah did not convert the public treasures to his
   private use: Neh. v. 15, So did not I, for I fear God.' This grace,
   when it is hazardous to be faithful to men, makes us to slight the
   danger: Exod. i. 17, The midwives feared God, and did not as the king
   of Egypt commanded them;' that kept them from obeying that cruel edict,
   to their own hazard. Neither hope of gain nor fear of loss can prevail
   where men fear God.

   (3d.) It breedeth zeal and diligence in the great and general business
   of our salvation, and maketh us more careful to approve ourselves unto
   God in our whole course, that we may be accepted of him: 2 Cor. vii. 1,
   Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.' God is a great God, and. will
   not be put off with anything, or served with a little religiousness by
   the by, but with more than ordinary care and zeal and diligence. Now,
   what inclineth us to this but the fear of God, or a reverence of his
   majesty and goodness? So Phil. ii. 12, let us work out our salvation
   with fear and trembling.' Salvation is not to be looked after between
   sleeping and waking; no, it requireth our great est attention, as
   having a sense of the weightiness of the work upon our hearts.

   Use. The use is to press us to two things:--

   1. To fear God.

   2. To keep his precepts if we would come under the character of his
   people.

   1. To fear God. Be not prejudiced against this grace; it is generally
   looked upon as a left-handed grace.

   [1.] It is not contrary to our blessedness: Prov. xxviii. 14, Blessed
   is he that feareth always.' It doth not infringe the happiness of our
   lives to be always in God's company, mindful of our duty to him. The
   angels in heaven always behold the face of our heavenly Father, and in
   that vision their supreme happiness consists. There is a fear of angels
   and a fear of devils. The angels ever fear and reverence God, the
   devils believe and tremble: the angels' fear is reverence, the devils'
   fear is torment. God doth not require that we should always perplex
   ourselves with terrors and scruples--that were a torture, not a
   blessedness; but God hath required that we should always have a deep
   sense of his majesty and goodness impressed upon our hearts. In heaven
   this fear will not cease; it is an essential respect due from the
   creature to the Creator; and as we shall love him, so fear him always;
   and if a godly man were put to his choice, he would not be without this
   fear of God. To live always in an admiration of his excellent majesty,
   a thankful sense of his goodness, and a regard to his eye and presence,
   this is our happiness.

   [2.] It is not contrary to our comfort and joy in the Lord. Fear to
   offend God, and joy in his favour may well stand together: Ps. ii. 10,
   Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.' There is a sweet
   mixture in a gracious heart of holy awe and seriousness, with a
   delightful sense of God's goodness: these graces may easily be combined
   and brought to kiss one another: Ps. cxii. 1, Blessed is the man that
   feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandments.' When we
   do most carefully abstain from what displeaseth him, we have most sense
   of his love, and do most cheerfully practise what he requireth of us.
   All other pleasures and delights are but May-games and toys to that of
   a strict obedience, which giveth the soul a continual feast: Acts ix.
   31, They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comforts of the
   Holy Ghost.' None have such a comfortable life as they who are most
   careful to avoid sin. We need this mixture: we should grow slight and
   secure without fear, and slavish without comfort: there must be fear to
   weaken the security of the flesh, and joy of faith to revive the soul.

   [3.] It is not contrary to courage and holy boldness, by which we
   should bear up under troubles and dangers. There is a spirit of fear
   opposite to a sound mind, 2 Tim. i. 7, when men are ashamed of the
   gospel, or afraid of the persecutions which accompany it: pneuma
   doulei'as, a cowardly spirit, a worldly fear of adversities, and
   dangers, losses, reproaches. So we are commanded, Fear not their fear,
   but sanctify the Lord God of hosts in your hearts, and let him be your
   fear, and let him be your dread,' Isa. viii. 12, 13. No; this is the
   fear of the world; but I press to the fear of the Lord: Luke xii. 4, 5,
   Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more
   that they can do; but I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: fear him
   which, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
   unto you, fear him.' This is the hest cure of the fear of the world, as
   one nail driveth out another. The fear to offend God inflameth our
   courage, and doth not abate it.

   [4.] It is not contrary to the grace of the gospel. No; it is the fruit
   of it: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
   feared.' The heart is shy of a condemning God, but closeth with and
   adhereth to a pardoning God; and nothing breedeth this fear to offend
   so much as a tender sense of the Lord's goodness in Christ.

   2. It presseth us to keep his precepts; that is the only evidence that
   the fear of God is rooted in our hearts. The heart must be prepared to
   keep all; they are all equally good, and they are all equally
   necessary; not one of them is in vain; and they are all joined
   together, like rings in a chain, and we are not sincere till we regard
   all: Ps. cxix. 6, Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto
   all thy commandments.' The judgment must approve all: Ps. cxix. 128,
   Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right,
   and I hate every false way.' The will must be set and fixed in a
   serious purpose to keep all, making conscience of the least as well as
   the greatest, the difficult as well as the easy: Heb. xiii. 18, I trust
   we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly.'
   Earnest endeavours must be used to grow up to a more exact conformity
   to all: Phil. iii. 14, I press toward the mark for the prize of the
   high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' Some corruption may remain after
   all our endeavours, but none must be reserved or cherished in the
   heart: Ps. lxvi. 18, If I regard iniquity in my heart.' There will be a
   secret love to some sins more than others, but it must not be indulged,
   but checked and striven against, and prayed against: Ps. cxix. 133, Let
   not any iniquity have dominion over me.' And this praying and striving
   must produce some effect, that in some measure it may be said of us
   what was said of Zachary and Elizabeth: Luke i. 6, They were both
   righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of
   the Lord blameless.' And we must increase and grow in this more and
   more: Col. i. 11, Strengthened with all might, according to his
   glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;'
   and 1 Thes. iv. 1, As ye have received of us how to walk, and to please
   God, so do you abound more and more.' The entertaining of some bosom
   sin, which we are loath to part withal, darkeneth our whole comfort.

   Secondly, David's professed respect to these sort of men, I am a
   companion of them that fear thee,' of them, and of all them.

   Doct. 2. That we should associate ourselves and keep communion with
   those who are truly gracious. Consider--

   1. In what sense we are to be companions of them that fear the Lord.

   2. Why it must be so, or the reasons.

   1. In what sense may David or any other be said to be a companion of
   those that fear the Lord, or what it importeth.

   [1.] We must join with them, or be engaged in the profession of the
   same faith and obedience unto God. The faith of all Christians is a
   common faith,' and their salvation a common salvation' to them all:
   Titus i. 4, Titus, my own son, after the common faith;' Jude 3, I gave
   diligence to write to you of the common salvation.' The communion with
   the saints which we believe in the Creed is in the first and chiefest
   place a communion in faith and charity, and this kind of communion all
   the members and parties of the catholic church have one with another.
   They are all quickened by the same Spirit, live by the same faith, wait
   for the hope of the same glory, and so they are companions in the same
   religion.

   [2.] As many as cohabit and live in a convenient nearness must often
   meet together to join in the same worship; for God hath instituted the
   assemblies of the faithful that we may openly and with mutual consent
   worship God in Christ, in prayer, thanksgiving, praises, word,
   sacraments, &c.; and the assembling of ourselves for these ends must
   not be forsaken for negligence or fear: Heb. x. 25, Forsake not the
   assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhort
   one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.' Now
   in this sense we are companions of those that fear God, as we join in
   worship with them: Ps. xlii. 4, I had gone with the multitude; I went
   with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with
   the multitude of them that kept holy-day.' To make one in the public
   assemblies and societies of the godly, whereby God may be publicly
   honoured, and souls converted, comforted, and saved, is to be a
   companion of them that fear God and keep his precepts.

   [3.] To love them, and prize them, and converse with them intimately
   upon all occasions, that by this society ye may excite one another to
   further proficiency in obedience. This is to be a companion with them
   that fear God: so the prophet kept company with those good men that he
   had described, that he himself might be confirmed by them, and that he
   might aid and confirm them. David said, Ps. xvi. 2, 3, My goodness
   extendeth not to thee, but to the saints on the earth, and the
   excellent, in whom is all my delight,' that is, his love and kindness
   was towards the godly, esteeming them more excellent and precious, how
   mean soever in condition, above the ungodly world, how great soever
   their rank and quality be, and taking pleasure in their society; them
   he valued, and them he esteemed above all the greatest men in the
   world, and in them was all his joy and delight. So Ps. xv. 4, In whose
   eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the
   Lord.' Mark these two opposite expressions, the excellent of the
   earth,' and a vile person.' Thus it is to look on things, not with the
   eye of sense, but faith and grace. So Paul longed to see the Romans, to
   be comforted by the mutual faith of him and them, Rom. i. 12. Well,
   then, to be a companion is to love tenderly, to prize and esteem one
   another for the grace of God which is in them, desiring one another's
   good, especially spiritual: Rejoicing with them that do rejoice, and
   mourning with them that mourn,' Rom. xii. 15; praying for one another,
   giving thanks for one another, preventing the evil, endeavouring the
   good of one another, by counsel, help, and mutual assistance. So that,
   I am a companion,' is that I contract a friendship with them that fear
   God.

   [4.] To be a companion with them is to own them in all conditions, and
   to take part and lot with them: Rev. i. 9, I, John, who am a brother
   and companion in tribulation, and the kingdom and patience of Jesus
   Christ.' We must have a fellowship with them not only in their
   privileges, but in their sufferings; not only companions in the
   kingdom, but companions in the tribulation and patience of Jesus
   Christ. So Heb. x. 33, Partly whilst ye were made a gazing-stock by
   reproaches and afflictions, and partly whilst ye became companions of
   those that were so used:' in the one was their passion, in the other
   their compassion, in that they not only suffered themselves, but owned
   their brethren when they suffered, and did receive them, and comfort
   them, and stand by them; so near is the union, and so dear and tender
   is the affection, of Christian brethren among themselves. So it is said
   of Moses, Heb. xi. 25, Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
   people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.' Alas!
   there are many summer friends to the gospel, painted butterflies, who
   are gone as soon as the sunshine of prosperity is gone. Brethren do
   almost forget that they are brethren, stand aloof, and are loath to own
   the afflicted.

   2. Reasons why David was a companion of all the saints.

   [1.] Our relation enforceth it: all that are in the church are of one
   kindred and lineage, descended from one common father, animated by one
   common spirit, and knit together in the profession of one common faith
   in Christ, and therefore must be companions one to another. As natural
   relation enforceth natural love, so Christian relation Christian love.
   To make this evident, let me tell you men may be considered in a
   twofold respect--as men, or as Christians and believers; and so there
   is a twofold love due to them, aga'pe, and philadelphi'a--2 Peter i. 7,
   Brotherly kindness and charity.' Our common neighbour hath the same
   nature that we have, and is of the same stock, for all come of one
   blood; besides our particular relation to them, either natural by
   kindred, consanguinity, or affinity, or political as members of the
   same kingdom, or other various respects of benefit, vicinity, or
   familiarity. As Christians and believers; this is common to all of them
   that they have spiritual kindred, as they are partakers of the same
   divine nature, or image of God, 2 Peter i. 4, which they have from the
   same stock and original, Christ, the second Adam: 1 Cor. xv. 45, The
   first Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening
   spirit;' and as they make but one family, Eph. iii. 15, Of whom the
   whole family in heaven and earth is named;' only this difference there
   is between Christ and Adam--we derive our original from Adam by the
   succession of many intervening generations; we are not his immediate
   children, as Cain and Abel were; but every believer doth immediately
   derive his life from Christ, hath it at the next hand; and besides
   this, there is an immediate communion by which every believer is joined
   to one another. There are several particular respects which do vary the
   degree of Christian love,--as men are public and private persons; some
   in remote churches, others in the same congregation; some excel in
   grace, others of a lower rank; some more, some less useful in advancing
   the kingdom of Christ. Thus you see the parallel between both these
   loves; Christian charity supposeth natural love as the foundation of
   it, for grace is built upon nature, but also it sublimateth it, and
   raiseth it to a higher degree of excellency than nature could reach;
   for the light of the gospel doth not abolish the light of nature, but
   perfecteth it, as the reasonable soul compriseth the vegetative and
   sensitive. We have other objects, see clearer arguments and reasons for
   love: Gal. vi. 10, As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good
   unto all men, especially them who are of the household of faith;' 2
   Peter i. 7, And add to godliness brotherly-kindness, to
   brotherly-kindness charity.'

   [2.] The new nature inclineth us to it, and this love floweth from an
   inward propension and cordial inclination, needing no other out ward
   allurement and provocation to procure it: 1 John v. 1, Whosoever
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and every one that
   loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.' The
   same love that inclineth us to love God inclineth us to love the
   brethren also: 1 John iv. 9, As touching brotherly love, ye need not
   that I should write unto you, for ye yourselves are taught of God to
   love one another.' God's teaching is by effectual impression, or
   inclining the heart: it must needs be so, because all believers live in
   the communion of the same Spirit As some philosophers say there is an
   anima mundi which holdeth all the parts of it together, so there is a
   spirit of communion which uniteth all the members of Christ's mystical
   body, and inclineth them one to another.

   [3.] Gratitude to Christ maketh us to prize all that belong to him, and
   to own them, and to be companions with them in all conditions: 1 John
   iii. 16-18, Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down
   his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
   But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and
   shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of
   God in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
   tongue, but in deed and in truth:' 1 John iv. 11, Beloved, if God so
   loved us, we ought also to love one another.' God loved us greatly,
   sent his own Son to die for us; now, how shall we express our
   thankfulness but by a dear and tender love to those who are Christ's?
   As David, when Jonathan was dead, inquired, Is there none of Jonathan's
   posterity to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake?' and at
   length he found lame Mephibosheth; so, is there none upon earth to whom
   we may show kindness for Christ's sake, who is now in heaven? Yes;
   there are the saints. Now these should be dear and precious to us, and
   we should be companions with them in all conditions.

   [4.] Because of the profit and utility redounding. A true friend is
   valuable in secular matters, much more a spiritual friend: Prov. xxvii.
   17, As iron sharpeneth iron, so doth a man the countenance of his
   friend.' When a man is dull, his friend puts an edge upon him; he is a
   mighty support and stay to us: Prov. xvii. 17, A friend loveth at all
   times, and a brother is born for adversity;' Prov. xxvii. 9, The
   perfume of an ointment rejoiceth the soul, so doth the sweetness of a
   man's friend by hearty counsel:' and in some cases he telleth us, A
   friend is better than a brother.' Now, if an ordinary true friend be so
   valuable, what is a Christian friend? A holy, heavenly, faithful friend
   is one of the greatest treasures upon earth; therefore we should seek
   out such and associate with them.

   Use. Let us see, then, whom we make our companions; let us avoid evil
   company lest we be defiled by them, and frequent good company that we
   may be mutually comforted and quickened: I am a companion of them that
   fear thee.' Interpreters suppose it was spoken in opposition to the
   bands of the wicked mentioned ver. 61. If they unite, so should we.
   This, then, is our business, the rejecting of evil company, and the
   choice of good companions. To enforce this, take these
   considerations:--

   1. Friendship is necessary, because man is zooo poli'tikon, a sociable
   creature. Man was not made to live alone, but in company with others,
   and for mutual society and fellowship; and they that fly all company
   and live to and by themselves are counted inhuman: Eccles. iv. 9-12,
   there the benefit of society is set forth, Two are better than one; for
   if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is
   alone when he falleth; he hath not another to lift him up again: if two
   lie together they have heat; but how can one be warm alone? and if one
   prevail against him, two shall withstand him.' Thus far Solomon. The
   Egyptians in their hieroglyphics expressed the unprofitableness of a
   solitary man by a single millstone, which alone grindeth no meal, but
   with its fellow is very serviceable for that purpose. The Lord ap
   pointed mankind to live in society, that they might be mutually helpful
   to one another: he never made them to live in deserts, as wild beasts
   love to go alone, but as the tame, in flocks and herds. The Lord hath
   given variety of gifts to the sons of men,--to all some, but to none
   all,--that one might stand in need of another, and make use of one
   another; and the subordination of one gift to another is the great
   instrument of upholding the world. Man is weak, and needeth society;
   for every man is insufficient to himself, and wants the help of others:
   and man is inclined by the bent of his nature; we have a certain desire
   to dwell together and live in society.

   2. Though man affects society, yet in our company we may use choice,
   and the good must converse with the good, for these reasons:--

   [1.] Because like will sort with like. Friendship is very much founded
   in suitableness, and maintained by it: idem velle et nolle, est
   amicitia. The godly will have special love to the godly, and they that
   fear God will be a companion of those that fear him; they are more dear
   and precious to them than others; as a wicked man easily smelleth out a
   fit companion: Ps. l. 18, When thou sawest a thief, then thou
   consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers,' Like
   will to like, and therefore the godly should be dear and precious to
   one another. Every man's company wherein he delighteth showeth what
   manner of man he is himself. The fowls of heaven flock together
   according to their several kinds. Ye shall not see doves flocking with
   the ravens, nor divers kinds intermixed. Every man is known by his
   company. They that delight in drinking, love swilling and drunken
   companions; in gaming, love such as make no conscience of their time;
   in hunting, love such as are addicted to such exercise; in arms, love
   men of a soldierly and military spirit; they that delight in books love
   scholars and persons of a philosophical breeding. That which every man
   is taken withal he loveth to do it with his friend; so certainly they
   that love and fear God delight in those that love him and fear him, and
   their company is a refreshing to one another.

   [2.] If they be not like, intimacy and converse will make them like:
   every man is wrought upon by his company. We imitate those whom we
   love, and with whom we often converse: Prov. xiii. 20, He that walketh
   with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be
   destroyed.' As a man that walketh in the sunshine is tanned insensibly,
   and as Moses' face shined by conversing with God, ere we are aware we
   adopt their manners and customs, and get a tincture from them. So Prov.
   xxii. 24, 25, Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious
   man thou shalt not go, lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy
   soul.' A man would think that of all sins, wrath and anger should not
   be propagated by company, the motions and furies of it are so uncomely
   to a beholder; yet secretly a liking of the person breedeth a liking of
   his ways, and a man getteth such a frame of spirit as those have whom
   he hath chosen for his companions. This should be the more regarded by
   us, because we are sooner made evil by evil company than good by good
   company: 1 Cor. xv. 33, Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt
   good manners;' evil words or omikli'ai kakai`, evil converses, corrupt
   good manners. We convey a disease to others, but not our health. Oh,
   how careful should we be of our friendship, that we may converse with
   such as may go before us as examples of piety, and provoke us by their
   strictness, heavenly-mindedness, mortification, and self-denial, to
   more love to God, zeal for his glory, and care of our salvation!
   Especially doth this concern the young, who, by their weakness of
   judgment, the vehemency of their affections, and want of experience,
   may be easily drawn into a snare.

   [3.] Our love to God should put us upon loving his people and making
   them our intimates; for religion influenceth all things, our relations,
   common employments, friendships, and converses; it is a smart question
   that of the prophet, 2 Chron. xix. 2, Shouldst thou help the ungodly,
   and love them that hate the Lord?' Surely a gracious heart cannot take
   them into his bosom. He loveth all with a love of good-will, as seeking
   their good, but not with a love of complacency, as delighting in them.
   Our neighbour must be loved as ourselves; our natural neighbour as a
   natural self, with a love of benevolence; and our spiritual neighbour
   as our spiritual self, with a love of complacency. In opposition to
   complacency we may hate our sinful neighbour, as we must ourselves: The
   wicked is an abomination to the righteous,' Prov. xxix. 26. The hatred
   of abomination is opposite to the love of complacency, as odium
   inimicitiae to amor benevolentiae. So David saith, Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22,
   Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am I not grieved with
   those that rise up against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred; I
   count them mine enemies;' I cannot cry up a confederacy with them. They
   that have a kindness for God will be thus affected.

   3. There is a threefold friendship--sinful, civil, and religious.

   [1.] Sinful, when men agree in evil, as drunkards with drunkards, or
   robbers with robbers: Prov. i. 14, Cast in thy lot among us; let us all
   have one purse.' When men conspire against the truth and interest of
   Christ in the world, or league themselves against his people, as Gebal,
   and Ammon, and Amalek, Ps. lxxxiii. 3, divided in interests, but united
   in hatred; as Herod and Pilate against Christ. This is unitas contra
   unitatem, as Austin, or consortium factionis, a bond of iniquity, or
   confederacy in evil. Again--

   [2.] There is a civil friendship, built on natural pleasure and profit,
   when men converse together for trade or other civil ends. Thus men are
   at liberty to choose their company as their interests and course of
   their employments lead them. The apostle saith, a man must go out of
   the world if he should, altogether abstain from the company of the
   wicked: 1 Cor. v. 9, 10, I wrote to you in an epistle not to company
   with fornicators;. yet not altogether with the fornicators of this
   world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, for then
   must ye needs go out of the world.' But--

   [3.] There is religious friendship, which is built on virtue and grace,
   and is called the unity of the Spirit:' Eph. vi. 3, Endeavouring to
   keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' Now this is the
   firmest bond of all. Sinful societies are soon dissolved; drunkards and
   profane fellows, though they seem to unite and hold together, yet upon
   every cross word they fall out and break; and civil friendship, which
   is built on pleasure and profit, cannot be so firm as that which is
   built on honesty and godliness. This is among the good and holy, who
   are not so changeable as the bad and carnal, and the ground of it is
   more lasting. This is amicitia per se, the other per accidens, from
   constitution of soul and likeness Of spirits. The good we seek may be
   possessed without envy; the friends do not straiten and intrench upon
   one another. Self-love and envy soon breaketh our friendship, but these
   seek the good of another as much as their own delight in the graces of
   one another.

   [4.] In religious friendship we owe a love to all that fear God: Acts
   iv. 32, The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one
   soul.' Love is called su'ndesmos tes teleio'tetos, the bond of
   perfectness,' Col. iii. 14. All things are bound together by a holy
   society, and preserved by it.' There is in love a desire of union and
   fellowship with those whom we love: 1 Sam. xviii. 1, Jonathan's soul
   was knit to the soul of David, and he loved him as his own soul;' and
   the apostle biddeth all Christians to be knit together in brotherly
   love,' Col. ii. 2; without this they are as a besom unbound, they fall
   all to pieces.

   [5.] Though there must be a friendship to all, yet some are to be
   chosen for our intimacy. Our Lord Christ had Peter, James, and John,
   Mat. xvii. 1; Mat. xxvi. 37, He took with him Peter, and the two sons
   of Zebedee.' When he raised Jairus' daughter, he suffered none to go in
   but Peter, James, and John,' Luke viii. 51, ekle'kton eklekto'teroi.
   This may be because of suitableness, or special inclination, or their
   excellency of grace, sicut se habet simpliciter ad simpliciter, ita
   magis ad magis.

   [6.] Our converse with these must be improved to the use of edifying,
   to do one another good by reproof, advice, counsel: Lev. xix. 17, Thou
   shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shalt in anywise reprove
   him, and not suffer sin to be upon him.' This is kindness to his soul:
   Rom. i. 11, I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
   spiritual gift, to the end you may be established.'

SERMON LXXII.

   The earth, Lord, is full of thy mercy; teach me thy statutes.--Ver. 64.

   IN this verse I observe--

   1. David's petition, teach me thy statutes.

   2. The argument or consideration which encourageth him to ask it of
   God, the earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy. The sum and substance of
   this verse will be comprised in these five propositions:--

   1. That saving knowledge is a benefit that must be asked of God.

   2. That this benefit cannot be too often or sufficiently enough asked;
   it is his continual request.

   3. In asking we are encouraged by the bounty or mercy of God.

   4. That God is merciful all his creatures declare.

   5. That his goodness to all creatures should confirm us in hoping for
   saving grace or spiritual good things.

   Prop. 1. That saving knowledge is a benefit that must be asked of God,
   for three reasons:--

   1. God is the proper author of it.

   2. It is a singular favour where he bestoweth it.

   3. Prayer is the appointed means to obtain it.

   1. God is the proper author of it. The fountain of wisdom is not in man
   himself, but God giveth it to whom he pleaseth. We were at first
   endowed by him with a reasonable soul and faculty of understanding:
   John i. 4, In him was life, and this life was the light of man.' All
   life is of God, especially that life which is light. The reasonable
   soul and the natural faculty of understanding cometh from him, and if
   it be disordered, as it is by sin, it must be by him restored and
   rectified; it is all God's gift. Now man is fallen from that light of
   life wherein he was created, his Maker must be his mender, he must go
   to the Father of lights' to have his light cleared, James i. 17, and
   his understanding freed from those mistakes and errors wherewith it was
   obscured. All knowledge is from God, much more saving grace or a sound
   knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel. Many scriptures speak to
   this: Job xxxii. 8, There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of
   the Almighty giveth understanding.' Though the dial be right set, yet
   it showeth not the time of the day except the sun shineth; so the
   spirit of man will grope and fumble in the clearest cases without a
   divine irradiation. God enlighteneth the mind, directeth the judgment,
   giveth understanding what to do or say. So he challengeth it as his
   prerogative: Job xxxviii. 26, Who hath put wisdom into the inward
   parts, or given understanding unto the heart?' The exercise of the
   outward senses is from God, who gives the seeing eye, the hearing ear,
   much more the right exercise of the internal faculties; an
   understanding heart is much more from the Lord: Prov. ii. 6, The Lord
   giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding;'
   Dan. ii. 21, He giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that
   know understanding.' Certainly all true wisdom is from above: James
   iii. 17, The wisdom that is from above is first pure,' &c. He
   distinguished there between the wisdom that is not from above and that
   which is from above. Man hath so much wisdom yet left as to cater for
   the body and the concernments of the bodily life (called thine own
   wisdom,' Prov. xxiii. 4); therefore he saith, ver. 15, This wisdom
   descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.' But for
   wisdom that concerneth the other world and our everlasting
   concernments, that is of God, that is from above; the wisdom that is
   exercised in pure, peaceable, fruitful, self-denying obedience. All
   that have any of this wisdom should acknowledge God, and all that would
   have it should depend upon him, and run to the fountain where enough is
   to be had. Man's wit is but borrowed, and he holdeth it of God. Vitia
   etiam sine magistro discuntur--he needeth no teacher in what is evil
   and carnal, but in what is holy and spiritual he needeth it.

   2. It is a singular favour to them on whom God bestoweth this heavenly
   wisdom, and so puts a difference between them and others. It is a
   greater sign of friendship and respect to them than if God had given
   them all the world: Mark xiii. 11, To you it is given to know the
   mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others it is not given.' This
   is no common benefit, but a favour which God reserveth for his peculiar
   people; so John xv. 15, I have called you friends, for all things which
   I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.' That is the
   highest argument of friendship, not to give you wealth, and honour, and
   greatness, but to give you an enlightened mind and a renewed heart. God
   may give honour and greatness and a worldly estate in judgment, as
   beasts fatted for destruction may be put into large pastures; but he
   doth not teach his statutes in judgment; it is a favour, though he
   useth a sharper discipline in teaching: Ps. xliv. 12, Blessed is the
   man whom thou chastenest, and teachest him out of thy law.' If God will
   teach his child not only by the word but by the rod, and useth a sharp
   discipline to instruct in the lesson of Christianity, it is a greater
   favour than if God did let him alone, and suffer him to perish with the
   wicked in his wrath. The prosperity of wicked men is so far from being
   a felicity to them, that it is rather the greatest judgment; and to be
   punished and rebuked by God for all that we do amiss, and thereby to be
   reduced to the sense and practice of our duty, is indeed the greatest
   favour and mercy of God, and so the most valuable felicity and evidence
   of God's tender care over us. So Prov. iii. 31, 32, Envy not the
   oppressor, and choose none of his ways; for the froward is an
   abomination to the Lord, and his secret is with the righteous.' You are
   depressed and kept bare and low, but your adversaries flourish and grow
   insolent; you cannot therefore say, God hateth you, or loveth them, If
   the Lord hath given you the saving knowledge of himself and his Christ,
   and only given them worldly happiness, it is a great token of his love
   to you and hatred to them, that you need not envy them, for you are
   dignified with the higher privilege.

   3. Prayer is the appointed means to obtain it. There are other means by
   which God conveyeth this heavenly wisdom, as by study and search. Dig
   for wisdom as for silver, and for understanding as hid treasures, Prov.
   ii. 4. Dig in the mines of knowledge: attend upon the word which is
   able to make us wise unto salvation: Mark iv. 24, Take heed what or how
   ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and
   unto you that hear shall more be given.' But all are sanctified by
   prayer: Prov. ii. 3, Cry for knowledge, and lift up thy voice for
   understanding.' Bene orasse est bene studuisse, saith Luther; so to
   pray well is to hear aright. God giveth understanding by the ministry
   of the word, but he will be sought unto and acknowledged in the gift,
   otherwise we make an idol of our own understanding: Prov. iii. 5, Trust
   in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not upon thine own
   understanding: in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.' Let us not make a God of our own wisdom; do not seek it in the
   means without prayer to the Lord. Let us not study without prayer, nor
   you hear without prayer, nor go about any business in your general and
   particular callings without prayer.

   Prop. 2. This benefit cannot be too often nor too sufficiently asked of
   God.

   1. Because of our want We never know so much but we may know more of
   God's mind, and know it better and to better purpose. To know things as
   we ought to know them is the great gift: 1 Cor. viii. 2, If any man
   thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought
   to know:' that we may be more sanctified, more prudent, and orderly in
   governing our hearts and lives, that we may know things seasonably when
   they concern us in any special business and temptation: Prov. xxviii.
   26, He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; but he that walketh
   wisely shall be delivered:' that is, he that followeth his own conceit
   soon falleth into a snare; he that maketh his bosom his oracle, and his
   own wit his counsel, thinks himself wise enough without daily seeking
   to God to order his own business, never succeedeth well, but plungeth
   himself into manifold inconveniences.

   2. From God's manner of giving; he is not weary and tired with constant
   supplicants: James i. 5, If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
   who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be
   given him.' The throne of grace lieth always open; the oftener we
   frequent it, the more welcome. We frown upon one that often troubleth
   us with his suits, but it is not so with God; we may beg and beg again.

   3. The value of the benefit itself. Saving knowledge, or the light of
   the Spirit, keepeth alive the work of grace in our hearts. Habitual
   graces will soon wither and decay without a continual influence. The
   increase of sanctification cometh into the soul by the increase of
   saving knowledge: 2 Peter i. 2, Grace be multiplied unto you, through
   the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ our Lord.' The more we grow
   thriving in knowledge, the more we grow in grace, and the heart and
   life is more engaged. As we learn somewhat more of God in Christ, our
   awe and love to him is increased: Eph. iv. 20, 21, Ye have not so
   learned Christ, if so be that you have heard him, and been taught of
   him as the truth is in Jesus;' that is, if ye are taught and instructed
   by Christ himself in the truth. It is not every sort of hearing Christ
   or knowledge which will do us good. Many learn him and know him who
   abuse that knowledge which they have of him; but if he effectually
   teach u by his Spirit, then our knowledge is practical and operative;
   we will practise what we know, be careful to please God in all things.

   4. From the temper of a gracious heart: a taste of this knowledge will
   make us desire a further supply, that we may be taught more, and the
   soul may be more sanctified; therefore doth David deal with God for the
   increase of saving knowledge. We are contented with a little taste of
   heavenly doctrine, but holy men are not so. Show me thy mind, let me
   see thy glory: Hosea vi. 3, Then shall we know, if we follow on to know
   the Lord.' They are for growth as well as truth; they experimentally
   know how good God is, and the more they know him the more they see
   their ignorance, and that there is more behind to be known of him.
   Before they had but a flying report of him, now they are acquainted
   with him, and have a nearer inspection into his ways, and this is but
   little in comparison of what they desire. We are bidden, 2 Peter iii.
   18, to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ.' Present measures do not satisfy them; they must grow in
   knowledge, as grow in grace, more love to Christ, more delight in his
   ways.

   Prop. 3. In asking any spiritual gift we are encouraged by the bounty
   and mercy of God. David signifieth both.

   1. His bounty or benignity, or that free inclination which is in God to
   do good to his creatures.

   2. His mercy respects the creature as affected with any misery. Mercy
   properly is a proneness to succour and relieve a man in misery
   notwithstanding sin. Now the larger thoughts of mercy, the more hope;
   partly because we have no plea of merit, and therefore mercy is the
   fountain of all the good which cometh to us from God. We cannot come to
   him as a debtor, and therefore we must come to him as a free
   benefactor. Wherewith can we oblige God? We have nothing to give to him
   but what is his own already, and was first received from him: All
   things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,' 1 Chron.
   xxix. 14; we pay the great governor of the world out of his own
   exchequer. The apostle maketh the challenge, Rom. xi. 35, Who hath
   given him first, and it shall be recompensed to him?' The sun oweth
   nothing to the beam, but the beam all to the sun; the fountain oweth
   nothing to the stream, but the stream hath all from the fountain: so we
   have all from God, can bring nothing to him which was not his before,
   and came from him. Partly because there is a contrary merit, an
   ill-deserving upon us, for which he might deny us any further mercies:
   Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the Lord; and therefore he will teach
   sinners in the way:' if the sinner be weary of his wandering, and would
   be directed of the Lord for the time to come, God is upright, he will
   not mislead us; and he is good, will readily lead us in a right path.
   Sin shall not obstruct our mercies, and therefore must not keep the
   penitent supplicant back from confidence to be heard in his prayer,
   when he would be directed in the ready way to happiness. If you would
   fain be reduced to a good life after all your straying, humbly lay
   yourselves at God's feet: 1 Kings xx. 31, We have heard that the kings
   of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put
   sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the
   king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.' If God were most
   tenacious, we have cause to beat his ears continually with our suits
   and supplications, such is our want; but he is good, and ready to guide
   poor creatures; nay, he is merciful; and former sins shall be no
   obstruction to us, if at length we are willing to return to our duty.

   Prop. 4. The universal experience of the world possesseth all men's
   minds with this apprehension, that God is a merciful God: The earth, O
   Lord, is full of thy mercy:' the world and everything therein sets
   forth his goodness to us. The same is said in other places: Ps. xxxiii.
   5, The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.' If earth, what is
   heaven? Ps. cxlv. 9, His tender mercy is over all his works.'

   1. Let us see that every creature is a monument and witness of God's
   mercy and goodness. Things animate and inanimate, the heavens and
   earth, and all things contained therein, declare that there is a
   powerful, wise, and good God. There is no part of the world that we can
   set our eyes upon but it speaketh praise to God, and the thoughts of
   his bounty to the creatures, especially to man; for all things were
   either subjected to man's dominion, or created for his use and benefit.
   If we look to the heavens, all serveth for the use and benefit of
   mankind: Ps. viii. 3, 4, When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
   fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man
   that thou are mindful of him, and the son of man, that thou visitest
   him?' The lowest heaven affordeth us breath, winds, rain; the middle or
   second heaven affordeth us heat, light, influence; and the third heaven
   an eternal habitation, if we serve God. In earth, all the things daily
   in our view speak to God's praise, if we had the leisure to hear them:
   these creatures and works of his that are daily in our view represent
   him as a merciful God. This is the lesson which is most legible in
   them, whether we sit at home in our houses or go abroad, and consider
   land or water. Go to the animate creatures, the beasts of the field:
   Ps. xxxvi. 6, Thou preservest man and beast:' Job xii. 7, 8, But ask
   now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air
   shall declare unto thee: or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee;
   and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in
   all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?' His providence
   reacheth to an innumerable multitude of creatures, giving them life and
   motion, and sustaining them, and relieving their necessities, and doth
   largely bestow his blessing upon them according to their nature and
   condition. And this goodness of God shineth forth in all his creatures;
   not only in what he doth to them themselves, but in what he doth about
   them for man's sake. They were defiled with man's sin, and therefore he
   might in justice have abolished them, or made them useless to man, or
   instruments of his grief; but they are continued for our comfort, that
   we might live in a well-furnished world. Now, come to man himself,
   good, bad, wicked, godly: His sun shineth, his rain falleth on the evil
   and good, just and unjust,' Mat. v. 44. Great mercy is still continued
   to the fallen creature, even to the impenitent: Acts xiv. 17,
   Neverthelesss he left not himself without witness, in that he did good,
   and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
   with food and gladness.' What was God's witness? Agathopoion, he doth
   good; much patience is used, men's lives continued while they sin, and
   means vouchsafed for their reclaiming; food, raiment, friends,
   habitations, health, ease, liberty afforded to them, and all to show
   that we have to do with a most merciful God, who is willing to be
   reconciled to the sinning creature. Go to the godly, and what is all
   their experience but a constant course of mercy? David's admiration
   declares it: Ps. cxxxix. 17, 18, How precious are thy thoughts to me, O
   Lord! how great is the sum of them! if I should count them, they are
   more in number than the sand.' He was in a maze when he thought of the
   various dispensations of God's providence; there was no getting out.
   The Lord filleth up his servants' lives with great and various mercies,
   even in their warfare and pilgrimage here in this world; abundance of
   invaluable mercies, that if we do but consider what we do receive, we
   must needs be confirmed in this truth by our own senses. Everything is
   a mercy to a vessel of mercy.

   2. Wherein God expresseth his mercy to them in creation and providence.

   [1.] In creating them. It was great mercy that, being infinitely
   perfect in himself from all eternity, and so not needing anything, he
   took the creatures out of nothing, which therefore could merit nothing,
   and communicated his goodness to them: For thy pleasure they are and
   were created,' Rev. iv. 11.

   [2.] In preserving and continuing them so long as he seeth good. The
   heavens continue according to his ordinance; the beasts, and fowls, and
   fishes continue according to his pleasure: all the living creatures
   need many things for their daily sustentation which their Creator
   abundantly supplieth to them, and therefore the whole earth is full of
   his mercy. One creature the scripture taketh notice of: Luke xii. 24,
   Consider the ravens, for God feedeth them:' and again, Job xxxvii. 41,
   He feedeth the young ravens when they cry and wander for lack of meat:'
   and Ps. cxlvii. 9, He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young
   ravens which cry.' Why is the raven made such an instance of providence
   above other fowls, or other living creatures? Some say it is animal
   sibi rapacissimum; others, other things, tou`s neo'ttous epiba'llei,
   casts its young out of the nest as soon as they are able to fly, and
   put to hard shifts for themselves. All this showeth his mercy, how
   ready he is to supply the miserable.

   Prop. 5. His goodness to all the creatures should confirm his people in
   hoping for saving grace or spiritual good things. Why, all the business
   will be to show you the force of this argument, and that it is a prop
   to faith.

   1. We may reason from the less to the greater. Our Lord hath taught us
   so for food and clothing: Mat. vi. 28-30, And why take ye thought for
   raiment? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not,
   neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all
   his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so
   clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is cast
   into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little
   faith?' For fowls and lilies, they have no arts of tilling, spinning,
   are not of such account with God as mankind, as his people. So for
   protection: Mat. x. 29-31, Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
   and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father: but
   the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not, therefore;
   ye are of more value than many sparrows.' The reasoning is good; if he
   hath mercy for kites, he hath also for children, who are not only in a
   higher rank of creatures, but in a renewed state, and reconciled to him
   by Christ, become his friends and children, whom he tendeth as the
   apple of his eye; much more when they come for spiritual benefits
   pleasing to the Lord: 1 Kings iii. 9, 10, Give, therefore, thy servant
   an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between
   good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? And
   the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.' Now
   all these amount to a strong probability, if not a certainty. It is a
   mistake to think that faith only goeth upon certainties. No; sometimes
   it is mightily encouraged by probabilities. These must not be left out;
   for if I want any spiritual blessing, is it not a great encouragement
   to remember God's merciful nature shining forth in all his works? If
   kind to his creatures, will he not be kind to me? If he causeth his sun
   to shine upon the wicked, will he not lift up the light of his
   countenance upon my soul? If his rain fall upon their fields, will he
   not let the dew of his grace fall upon my barren heart? Though the
   argument be not absolutely and infallibly conclusive, yet here is such
   a concurrence of probabilities that we should go and try what he will
   do for our souls.

   2. They in their rank have their supplies, and we in our rank have our
   supplies; therefore his kindness to all creatures should encourage new
   creatures to expect their help from him; for God doth good to all his
   creatures according to their necessity and capacity; his giving them
   sup plies convenient for them is a pawn of God's pleasure to bestow
   upon his servants greater gifts than these. All things that look to God
   have necessaries provided for them according to the condition of their
   nature; and therefore, if you have another nature, and besides the good
   things of this life do need the good things which belong to the life to
   come, he will give us gifts and graces as he giveth them their food;
   for these are as necessary for this kind of life as food for that. As
   they in their rank find mercy, so we in ours; his general goodness
   confirmeth us in expecting these more special favours; for as there is
   a general benignity to all creatures, so there is a special to his
   children: Ps. xxxvi. 6, 7, Thou preservest man and beast. How excellent
   is thy loving-kindness, O Lord! therefore the children of men put their
   trust under the shadow of thy wings.' His common kindness and his
   special love are often compared together; they agree in this, that both
   come from a good God. Therefore the argument holdeth strong, if good to
   all creatures, then good to new creatures. Why should we think that he
   would not show his goodness to us also? Again, they agree in this, that
   in doing good God doth not consider the worthiness of the creature, but
   his own goodness and self-inclination to preserve what he hath made; as
   he did not disdain to give life to the meanest creatures, so he doth
   not disdain to preserve them. As they had their life from him at first,
   so they have their life still in him, the poorest worm not excepted:
   not a worm, not a gnat, not a fly but tastes of God's bounty. God
   disdaineth not to look after the most abject things. So the plea of
   unworthiness lieth not in bar against the new creature, for necessary
   supplies God giveth out of his own goodness. Now, they differ in the
   kinds of the mercy,--one common, the other saving; and the special
   subjects of them,--one is to all creatures, the other is to God's
   peculiar people; and in the manner of conveyance,--the one floweth in
   the channel of common providence, the other is conveyed to us by the
   golden pipe of the Mediator. Well, then, the creatures have their
   mercies, and wicked men their mercies, that they prize and value; and
   the people of God have also what they prize and esteem.

   3. God doth good to every one according to their necessity and
   capacity. He doth not give meat to the trees, nor stones to the beasts,
   but provideth food and nourishment convenient for them; so to his
   people, according to their condition of nature and special capacity.
   The general capacity is the condition of their natures, the special
   capacity is want or earnest desire. If we extremely need or earnestly
   desire these blessings, then we may reason from God's general goodness
   to all the creatures to that special act of goodness which we expect
   from him. Pray, mark how God's general goodness is expressed, Ps. cxlv.
   15, 16, The eyes of all things wait upon thee, and thou givest them
   their meat in due season: thou openest thy hand and satisfiest the
   desire of every living thing.' He keepeth a constant eye of providence,
   and if the desire be great, he doth not frustrate the natural
   expectation of hungry creatures, but giveth them that sort of food
   which is fit for them. Now God expecteth the same from new creatures:
   if necessity and vehement desire meet, he promises supply: Open thy
   mouth wide, and I will fill it,' Ps. lxxxi. 10; and Ps. cxlv. 19, The
   Lord will fulfil the desire of them that fear him, he also will hear
   their cry, and will save them.' The beasts mourn and cry in their kind;
   we pray and cry in our kind: needy desires will be heard. He is in a
   capacity to receive spiritual blessings who is sensible of their
   necessity for the happiness of his immortal soul, and doth prize and
   value them, and earnestly desire them. The man of God was under a
   necessity, for he apprehended himself miserable, and at a loss without
   it; for he desired no other mercy. A gracious heart cannot be satisfied
   with low things. Be thus affected, and then this argument will be of
   use to you.

   Use 1. For reproof. Since God is so merciful, how much are they to
   blame--

   1. Who render themselves incapable of the benefit of mercy by
   impenitence persisted in against the means of grace! They slight his
   common mercy, and cut off themselves from his saving mercy. Abused
   goodness will be destructive: Rom. ii. 4, 5, Or despisest thou the
   riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing
   that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? but after thy
   hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against
   the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.'

   2. The stupid and senseless, which do not take notice of the mercy of
   God which shineth forth in all the creatures! A man can turn his eye
   nowhere but in every place and quarter of the world he shall see plain
   testimonies of God's mercy. But alas! how much of this is lost and
   passed over for want of observation! Isa. i. 3, The ox knoweth his
   owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my
   people doth not consider.' All this goodness was left in the earth to
   invite our minds and hearts to God; therefore, as the bee sucketh honey
   out of every flower, so should we still dwell on the thoughts of God's
   goodness, represented to us in everything we see and feel.

   3. That think of God's mercy with extenuating and diminishing thoughts,
   and do not raise their hopes and confidence by a serious reflection
   upon that ample discovery which he hath made of it in all his works! If
   God be good to all his creatures, why should we be left out of the
   number? Surely God will not be backward to those that earnestly desire
   his grace; therefore those that deject themselves, that say, God will
   not hear me, or regard my prayers, are to be condemned.

   Use 2. Information, the lively light of the Spirit is a special mercy,
   Our misery lieth in the ignorance of God and the transgression of his
   law; our happiness in being enlightened and sanctified by the Spirit of
   wisdom and understanding. It is God's great gift: Jer. xxiv. 7, I will
   give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my
   people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with all
   their heart.'

   Use 3. To exhort you to cherish in your souls good thoughts of God, and
   the fulness and largeness of his bounty and mercy. The devil seeks to
   weaken our opinion of God's goodness; he thought to possess our first
   parents with this conceit, that God was envious, so as to draw them
   away from God. It will be of use to you:--

   1. In all afflictive providences. Those who are poor and destitute, or
   in prison and banishment, or bereft of children, or oppressed with
   guilty fears, or assaulted with any other calamity: Job xiii. 15,
   Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:' still he is a good God.
   Here is the glory of faith, to believe him as a gracious father when we
   feel him as an enemy. Satan will be sure to put in upon these
   occasions--to tell you that God is an enemy, harsh, severe, implacable
   in his dealings, one that regardeth you not in your misery, that giveth
   you no rest nor respite in your troubles; if he did not hate you, how
   could he deal thus with you? and so striketh a terror into the minds of
   men, that they are afraid of nothing so much as of God, and of coming
   to him by Christ. No; God is love,' a father when he frowneth as well
   as when he smileth: Heb. xii. 10, He verily chastiseth us for our
   profit;' and we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned
   with the world.' And in reason should it not be so? Did your parents
   hate you because they were careful of your breeding, and sometimes
   corrected you for your faults? There is more of compassion than passion
   in his severest strokes. He hath the bowels of a mother, but yet the
   wisdom of a father. His love must not be exercised to the prejudice of
   his other attributes. He that pulleth you out of a deep gulf, though he
   breaketh your arm in pulling you out, doth not he love you? God is
   love, and the giver of all good things.

   2. It is a great motive to repentance. As the prodigal thought of his
   father, so should we return: Jer. iii. 12, Go and proclaim these words
   toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the
   Lord, and I will not cause mine auger to fall upon you; for I am
   merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.' Come,
   lie at his feet, see what mine infinite love will do for you: 1 Kings
   xx. 31, We have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are
   merciful kings.' When you first begin with God, this is an argument and
   ground of comfort, much more when you renew your repentance. Hard
   thoughts of God keep us off from him, but his loving and merciful
   nature inviteth us to him.

   3. It sweetens the duties of holiness: 1 John v. 3, This is the love of
   God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not
   grievous.' This makes our resistance of sin more serious: Ezra ix. 13,
   Seeing thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved,
   should we again break thy commandments?'

   4. To quicken and enliven your prayers for grace. You have to do with a
   merciful God: Ps. cxlv. 19, He will fulfil the desires of them that
   fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXXIII.

   Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy
   word.--Ver. 65.

   THE addresses that are made to God in this psalm are mostly prayers;
   while we are in the world we are compassed about with divers
   necessities and wants, but yet there is an intermixture of
   thanksgivings. We must not always be complaining, but sometimes giving
   of thanks. David was often exercised with various calamities; but as
   soon as he got rid of any danger, or obtained any deliverance, he is
   ready with his thanks and praises. Blessed will that time be when our
   mournings are altogether turned into triumphs, and our complaints into
   thanksgivings. But now here in the world gratulation should not wholly
   be shut out, but find a room in our addresses to God, as well as
   acknowledgments of sin and supplications for grace. None have to do
   with God but they find him bountiful, and there is no reason but
   present mercies should be acknowledged. In this Verse you have the
   working of a thankful soul, sensible of the benefits already obtained
   in prayer, and making hearty acknowledgment of them to God: Thou hast
   dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word.' Observe--

   1. An acknowledgment of some benefit bestowed, thou hast dealt well
   with thy servant.

   2. The way in which it was bestowed, according to thy word.

   First, An acknowledgment of some benefit bestowed. In it observe:--

   1. The party giving, thou, O Lord.

   2. The act of bounty, generally expressed, thou hast dealt well.

   3. The party receiving, with thy servant.

   The fountain of all that we have is the goodness and fidelity of God;
   the promise is the channel and pipe by which it is conveyed to us, and
   the object is God's servant. When all these concur, how sweet is it! A
   good God is ready to show us mercy, and this mercy assured to us by
   promise, and God's servants capacitated to receive mercy. There is an
   excellent cause, which is the benignity of God; a sure conveyance,
   which is the promise of God; and a prepared object, who are the
   servants of God.

   1. The party giving is God himself: all good is to be referred to God
   as the author of it.

   2. The benefit received is generally expressed, Thou hast dealt well.'
   Some translations out of the Hebrew, bonum fecisti--thou hast done good
   with thy servant; the Septuagint, chrestoteta epoi'esas meta` tou
   dou'lou sou--thou hast made goodness to or with thy servant: out of
   them the vulgar, bonitatem fecisti. Some take this clause generally,
   whatever thou dost for thy servants is good; they count it so, though
   it be never so contrary to the interest of the flesh: sickness is good,
   loss of friends is good, and so is poverty and loss of goods to a
   humble and thankful mind. But surely David speaketh here of some supply
   and deliverance wherein God had made good some promise to him. The
   Jewish rabbis understand it of his return to the kingdom, but most
   Christian writers understand it of some spiritual benefit, that good
   which God had done to him. If anything may be collected from the
   subsequent verses, it was certainly some spiritual good. The Septuagint
   repeats chresto'tetatwice, in this and the following verse, as if he
   acknowledged the benefit of that good judgment and knowledge of which
   there he beggeth an increase. It was in part given him already, and
   that learned by afflictions, in the third verse of this portion: Before
   I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have learned thy word.' Now
   then, go on to increase this work, this goodness which thou hast shown
   to thy servant.

   3. The object, to thy servant.' It is an honourable comfortable style;
   David delighteth in it. God is a bountiful and a gracious master, ready
   to do good to his servants, rewarding them with grace here, and
   crowning that grace with glory hereafter: Heb. xi. 6, He that cometh to
   God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him.'

   Secondly, The manner how this is assured and brought about, According
   to thy word.' That word, which is the encouragement of our prayer, is
   the rule of God's proceedings. Some things are given by a common
   providence, other things are given us as servants of God, or according
   to the promises that are made us in the word.

   Doct. 1. That God doth good to his servants.

   Doct. 2. That the good which God hath done for us should be thankfully
   acknowledged.

   Doct. 3. That in our thankful acknowledgments we should take notice of
   God's truth, as well as his benignity and goodness.

   Doct. I. That God doth good to his servants. David giveth us here his
   own experience, and every one that is a faithful servant of God may
   come in with the like acknowledgments; for what proof God giveth of his
   goodness to any one of his servants, it is a pledge of that love,
   respect, and care that he beareth towards all the rest. Jacob
   acknowledged the same: Gen. xxxiii. 11, The Lord hath dealt graciously
   with me;' that was his account of providence.

   1. From the inclination of his own nature: Ps. cxix. 68, Thou art good,
   and thou dost good.' The Psalmist concludeth this act from his nature.
   The sun doth not more naturally shine, nor fire more naturally burn,
   nor water more naturally flow, than acts of grace and goodness do
   naturally flow from God. If there be anything besides benefits in the
   world, the fault is not in God, but in us, who by sin, provoke him to
   do otherwise.

   2. The obligation of his promise; so this good cometh in as a reward,
   according to the law of his grace. He hath engaged himself by his
   promise to give us all good things: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, The Lord God is a
   sun and a shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing
   will he withhold from them that walk uprightly;' Ps. xxxiv. 9, 10, Oh,
   fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there is no want to them that fear
   him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but they that seek the
   Lord shall not want any good thing.' Therefore it is said, Micah ii. 7,
   Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?' The words
   saying good' is a doing good; when it is said, it may be accounted
   done, because of the certain performance of what is said.

   3. The preparation of his people; his servants are capable. God is
   good, and doeth good, modo non ponatur obex, except we tie his hands
   and hinder our own mercies. There are certain laws of commerce between
   God and his creatures, so between God and man; he meeteth us with his
   blessings in the way of our duty: Amos vi. 12, Shall horses run upon
   the rock? will one plough there with oxen?' Some ground is incapable of
   being ploughed; some are morally incapable of having good done to or
   for them. But when the creature is in a capacity, God communicateth his
   goodness to them, dealeth with men as they deal with him: Ps. xviii.
   25, 26, With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, with an
   upright man thou wilt show thyself upright, with the pure thou wilt
   show thyself pure, with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward;' so
   Ps. cxxv. 4, Do good to those that be good, and to them that are
   upright in their hearts.' God is and will be gracious and bountiful to
   all those that continue faithful to him, and will never leave any
   degree of goodness unrewarded; the covenant shall not fail on his part.

   Use 1. Let us be persuaded of this truth; it is one of the first things
   in religion, Heb. xi. 6, He that cometh to God must believe that he is,
   and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.' Next unto
   his being, his bounty, or else our religion will be cold or none at
   all. Many conceive amiss of God, and draw an ill picture of him in
   their minds, as if he were hard to be pleased, always frowning. Did we
   look upon him as one that is good and willing to do good, we would have
   less backwardness to duty and weariness in his service. Satan drew off
   the hearts of our first parents from God by vain surmises, as if he
   were severe and envious: Gen. iii. 5, God doth know that in the day ye
   eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
   knowing good and evil.' This first battery was against the persuasion
   of God's goodness and kindness to man, which he endeavoureth to
   discredit. Yea, God's people may have the sense of his goodness
   strangely weakened. David is fain with violence to hold the conclusion
   which Satan would fain wrest out of his hands: Ps. lxxiii. 1, Truly God
   is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart.' Therefore we
   had need to fortify our hearts and forearm ourselves with strong
   consolations and arguments.

   1. He doth good to his enemies, and therefore certainly he will much
   more to his servants: He is good to all;' Ps. cxlv. 9, The Lord is good
   to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.' The heathens
   had experience of it: Acts xiv. 17, Nevertheless he left not himself
   without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and
   fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.' And will
   he be unkind to his servants, to whom he is engaged by promise? It
   cannot be.

   2. Consider Christ's reasoning: Mat. vii. 11, If ye then, being evil,
   know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall
   your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?'
   God will not deal worse with his children than men do with theirs. We
   are natural and sinful parents: if we have any faith, or reason, or
   sense, we cannot gainsay this conclusion. A father will not be
   unnatural to his child; the most godless men will love their children,
   and seek their welfare, and do good unto them. Surely our heavenly
   Father will supply all our necessities, satisfy all our desires: he is
   more fatherly than all the fathers in the world can be; all the
   goodness in men is but as a drop to the ocean.

   3. Consider, he never giveth his people any discouragement or just
   cause to complain of him: Micah vi. 3, O my people, what have I done
   unto thee? or wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me;' Jer.
   ii. 5, Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in
   me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanities and
   become vain?' Why:--

   [1.] His commands are not grievous: Mat. xi. 30, My yoke is easy and my
   burthen is light;' 1 John v. 3, His commandments are not grievous.' He
   prescribeth and commandeth nothing but for our good: Deut. vi. 24, And
   the Lord commandeth us to do all the statutes, to fear the Lord our God
   for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this
   day.' That he may with honour perform and make good all that he hath
   promised: Gen. xviii 19, For I know him, that he will command his
   children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of
   the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon
   Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.' The obstructions removed,
   and grace flows out freely.

   [2.] Trials sent by him are not above measure: 1 Cor. x. 13, There hath
   no temptation taken you, but such as is common to men; but God is
   faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are
   able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye
   may be able to bear it;' Isa. xxvii. 8, In measure when it shooteth
   forth wilt thou debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of
   the east wind.' He dealeth with much discretion and moderation, not
   according to the greatness of his power or the heinousness of their
   sin, but observeth our strength, what we are able to bear.

   [3.] His punishments are not above deservings: Ezra ix. 13, Seeing that
   thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve;' Job
   xi. 6, Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine
   iniquity deserveth.'

   [4.] He is not hard to be pleased, nor inexorable upon every failing:
   Mal. iii. 17, And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that
   day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth
   his own son that serveth him.' Many think God watch eth occasions to
   destroy them, or at least to molest and trouble them. No; he passeth by
   many weaknesses, or else what would become of the best of his children?
   pardoneth many sins, where the heart is sincere: 2 Chron. xxx. 18, 19,
   The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek God,
   the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
   preparation of the sanctuary.'

   4. If he doth not give them the good things of this world, he giveth
   them better in lieu of them. While they are here in this world they
   have those things not only that are good, but make them good, which
   cannot be said of all the things of this world; they may easily make us
   worse, but they cannot make us better. He giveth them such things as
   tend to the enjoyment of the chiefest good, which is himself. As he is
   a good God, he pardoneth their sins: Ps. xxv. 7, Remember not the sins
   of my youth, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord;' that is one of the
   effects of his goodness to them. He directs them in the way of life:
   Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach
   sinners in the way.' He beginneth, carrieth on, and completeth their
   salvation: 2 Thes. i. 11, Wherefore also we pray always for you, that
   our God would count you worthy of his calling, and fulfil all the good
   pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power.' Thus he
   giveth the best things, though he deny some common things, which are no
   arguments of his special favour; and it is dangerous to have our eyes
   fastened upon other wants when we have these things, and to repine
   against God, who hath dealt graciously with us in the higher
   expressions of his love.

   5. The evil things of this world, which are not good in themselves, he
   turneth to good: Rom. viii. 28, All things shall work together for good
   to them that love God.' He is able to bring light out of darkness, or
   give light in darkness, or turn darkness into light; to give inward joy
   and comfort under all calamities, to support and sustain under all
   heavy pressures, and to deliver out of all distresses.

   6. He doth give them so much of the good things of the world as is
   convenient for them: Ps. xxxiv. 9, Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints,
   for there is no want to them that fear him;' Ps. lxxxiv. 11, The Lord
   God is a sun and a shield; the Lord will give grace and glory, and no
   good thing will he withhold from them that walk up rightly.' He giveth
   protection when it is necessary: Nahum i. 7, The Lord is good, a
   stronghold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth those that trust in
   him:' Ezra vi. 22, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that
   seek him.' He hath a great inclination to diffuse his benefits.

   7. His doing good is chiefly in the world to come: John xii. 26, If any
   man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my
   servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.' Here he is
   with them in troubles, there they shall be with him in glory; here he
   can put marks of favour upon them, and distinguish between those that
   serve him and those that serve him not: Mal. iii. 17, They shall be
   mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up my jewels, and I will
   spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him:' there he
   will manifest his favour in the face of all the world.

   Use 2. To persuade you to become the servants of God: you will have a
   good master if you be what you profess to be. Every Christian should
   say, as Paul did, Acts xxvii. 23, The God whose I am, and whom I
   serve.' He is God's, and serveth God. (1.) He is God's by creation, for
   he made him out of nothing: Ps. c. 3, Know ye that the Lord he is God;
   it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people and
   the sheep of his pasture;' Col. i. 16, All things were created by him
   and for him.' By redemption; 1 Cor. vi. 20, Ye are bought with a price,
   therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit, which is God's.' By
   covenant; Isa. xliv. 5, One shall say, I am the Lord's, and another
   shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe
   with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of
   Israel;' Ezek. xvi. 8, I sware unto thee, and entered into covenant
   with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine;' and so voluntarily
   he is God's. Wicked men are God's in right, but against their wills;
   the godly are willingly God's. A man will never be hearty in his
   obedience and subjection till he look upon himself as God's. See an
   instance in the wicked, whose ungodliness and rebellion against God
   cometh from looking upon themselves as their own: Ps. xii. 4, Who have
   said, With our tongues will we prevail; our lips are our own; who is
   lord over us?' Their time their own, wealth their own, interest their
   own, bodies their own, souls their own, and therefore think they may
   employ all these things as they please. On the other side, take an
   instance of self-denial. Why so careful to serve and glorify God? Rom.
   xiv. 8, For whether we live, we live Unto the Lord, and whether we die,
   we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the
   Lord's;' they have given up themselves to be employed at his command.
   (2.) Him they serve. How do they serve him? (1st.) They must serve God
   with the spirit as well as the body: Rom. i. 9, God is my witness, whom
   I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son.' So Phil. iii. 3, We
   are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit:' Rom. xii. 11,
   Fervent in spirit, serving the Lord:' Rom. vii. 6, That we should serve
   in newness of spirit.' When the heart is renewed, disposed, and fitted
   for his fear and service, there is an honest purpose and endeavour to
   serve him. (2d.) You must serve him faithfully, devoting yourselves to
   do his will, and to seek his glory. Your intention, trade, and study
   must be to honour God and please him, that if it be asked for whom are
   you at work? for whom speaking or spending your time? whose business
   are you doing? you may answer, All is for God. If the pleasing of the
   flesh be their work or scope, they are said to serve their own bellies:
   Rom. xvi. 18. They that are such serve not the Lord Jesus, but their
   own belly.' (3d.) Cheerfully; having so good a master, let us take
   pleasure in our work. Here is all good--good master, good work, good
   wages. Certainly the more good any man findeth God to be, and the more
   good he himself hath received, the more good he ought to be: the
   goodness of God should melt us and awe us. There are two questions
   every one of you should put to yourselves, What hath God done for you?
   and, What have you done for God? When you thus serve God, you may plead
   it to God, as David, Ps. cxvi. 16, O Lord, truly I am thy servant, I am
   thy servant.' You may expect relief, and protection, and maintenance.
   Servants have their dole and portion from their masters' hands: Ps.
   cxxiii. 2, As the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes
   wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.' He that
   doth God's will shall have his protection and blessing; you have a
   sanctified interest in all that falleth to your share: 1 Cor. iii. 22,
   23, Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or life, or death, or things
   present, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Christ's, and
   Christ is God's.' Lastly, God will now and then visibly put some marks
   of distinction on them: Mal. iii. 18, Then shall ye return, and discern
   between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God, and
   him that serveth him not.' For a while their glory may be clouded, they
   may be hardly dealt with in the world, but God hath his times of
   presenting all things in their own colours; but the chief time of
   manifestation is hereafter; when the servants of Christ come to receive
   their full reward, then they find him to be a good master indeed: John
   xii. 26, If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.'

   Doct. 2. That the good which God hath done for us should be thankfully
   acknowledged. We should not be always craving, always complaining;
   there should be a mixture of thanksgiving: Col. iv. 6, Continue in
   prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;' together with the
   expression of our wants and desires, there must be thanksgiving for
   favours already received.

   1. There is a time for all things, for confessing sin, for begging
   mercy, for thankful acknowledgments; though in every address to God
   there should be somewhat of all these, yet at certain seasons one is
   predominant: in a time when God is offended, confession of sin; in a
   time of great wants and straits, prayer; in a time of great receivings,
   thanks. The times that pass over us bring upon us many changes; every
   change of dispensation must be sanctified by a suitable duty. As no
   condition is so bad but a good man can find an occasion of praising God
   and trusting in him, so no condition so good but matter of humbling and
   self-abasing will arise; yet there are special occasions that require
   the one or the other. Opus diei in die suo. James v. 13, Is any among
   you afflicted? let him pray: is any merry? let him sing psalms;' Ps. l.
   15, Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify me.'

   2. It is a disingenuous spirit to ask mercy for supplying our wants or
   delivering us from troubles, and not acknowledge mercy when that supply
   or deliverance is received. Prayer is a work of necessity, but praise
   of mere duty. Self-love will put us upon prayer, but the love of God
   upon praise and thanksgiving; we pray because we need God, we praise
   because we love God, and have a sense of his goodness to us: Luke xvii.
   15, One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with
   a loud voice glorified God.' Most turn back upon the mercy-seat, do not
   give glory to God when their turn is served.

   3. It is for the glory and honour of God that his servants should speak
   good of his name. When they are always complaining, they bring an ill
   report upon the ways of God, like the spies that went to view the
   promised land; but it is a great invitation to others when we can tell
   them how good God hath been to us: Ps. xxxiv. 8, Oh, taste and see that
   the Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusteth in him.' This doth
   draw in others to come and take share with us.

   4. It is for our profit; the more thankful for mercies, the more they
   are increased upon us; as vapours return in showers, the sea putteth
   out of her fulness into the rivers, and they again refund into the sea
   the water received thence: Ps. lxvii. 5, 6, Let the people praise thee,
   O Lord; then shall the earth bring forth her increase.' When the
   springs are low, we pour in a little water into the pump, not to enrich
   the fountain, but to bring up more for ourselves. It is not only true
   of outward increase, but spiritual also: Col. ii. 7, Be ye rooted in
   the faith, and abound therein with thanksgiving.' If we give thanks for
   so much grace as we have already received, it is the way to increase
   our store; we do no more thrive in victory over corruption, or the
   increase of divers graces, because we do no more give thanks.

   5. It prevents many sins. I shall name two:--

   [1.] Hardness of heart. When we are not thankful for blessings, they
   prove an occasion to the flesh, and so our table is made a snare, Ps.
   lxix. 22, and our welfare a trap. Men go on stupidly receiving
   blessings, but do not acknowledge the donor; but when we own God upon
   all occasions, the creature is sanctified, and the heart kept humble: 1
   Tim. iv. 4, 5, Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
   refused, if it be received with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified by
   the word of God and prayer;' an acknowledgment from whom it cometh.

   [2.] It suppresseth murmuring, and that fretting, quarrelling,
   impatient, and distrustful humour which often showeth itself against
   God, even sometimes in our prayers and supplications. Nothing conduceth
   more to quiet our hearts in a dependence upon God for the future, and
   to allay our distrusts, discontents, and unquiet thoughts, than a holy
   exercise of thanksgiving: Phil. iv. 6, Be careful for no thing, but in
   everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
   requests be made known to God.' Bless him for favours already received,
   and you will leave the burden of your care upon him for the future. God
   is where he was at first, and what he hath done he can do still.

   Use. The use is, to press us to the serious and frequent discharge of
   this duty. It is a duty very necessary, very profitable, and very
   delightful; but usually we are backward, are not as careful to render
   thanks for the enjoyment of blessings as we are earnest and importunate
   in the want of them. It cometh to pass partly by the greediness of our
   desires, as a dog that swalloweth up every bit that is cast to him, and
   still looketh for more. Vidisti aliquando canem, saith Seneca, missa a
   domino frusta panis aut carnis aperto ore captantem, et quicquid
   excipit. protinus integrum devorat, et semper ad spem futuri hiat. This
   is an emblem of us; we swallow whatever the bounty of God throws forth
   without thanks, and still we look for more, as if all the former
   mercies were nothing; therefore are warm in petitions, but cold, raw,
   and infrequent in gratulations. Partly when we have mercies, we know
   not their value by the enjoyment as much as by the want. Ophthalmoi' ti
   a'gan lampro`n ouch orosi, saith Basil--a thing too near the eye cannot
   be seen, it darkeneth us with its splendour. God must set things at a
   distance to make us value them. Therefore we are more prone to complain
   than to give thanks. Partly from self-love; when our turn is served, we
   neglect God; as the raven returned to Noah no more, when there was
   floating carrion for it to feed upon, Gen. viii. 7. Wants try us more
   than blessings: Hosea v. 15, In their affliction they will seek me
   early.' Our interest swayeth us more than our duty. Partly from a dark
   legal spirit, which will not own grace when it is near us, when
   Christians look altogether in the glass of the law, to exclude the
   comfort of the gospel f and to keep themselves under the rack of
   perplexing fears.

   To remedy this--

   1. Let us acknowledge God in all we do enjoy: Hosea ii. 8, She did not
   consider that I gave her corn, and oil, and flax.' We are unthankful to
   God and man, but more to God. Comforts that come from an invisible
   hand, we look upon them as things that fall out of course, and so do
   not praise the giver; therefore let us awaken our hearts to the
   remembrance of God. Whosoever be the next hand, it is by his
   providence; and there is reason he should be praised and owned. It is
   not he that brings the present, but he that sendeth it, that deserveth
   our thanks. Beasts will own their benefactor: Isa. i. 3, The ox knoweth
   his owner, and the ass his master's crib;' and if God be our
   benefactor, he must be owned and loved. If a man give us but a small
   sum, or a parcel of land, how do we court him or observe him! Less
   reason why God should look upon us, who is so high. A small remembrance
   from a great prince, no way obliged, who no way needeth me, to whom I
   can be no way profitable, is much valued; and will not I acknowledge
   God in his gifts? When you were in distress you acknowledged, he alone
   could send you help, and had high thoughts of the mercy; then what
   promises did you make? The mercy is the same now that it was then,
   therefore you should have the same apprehensions of it.

   2. Let us not give thanks by the heap, but distinctly; acknowledge
   God's mercies in all cases. Particulars are most affective: let us come
   to an account for God, and recollect the passages of our lives, what he
   hath done for body and soul: Ps. cxxxix. 17, How precious also are thy
   thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!' What he hath
   done for us before time, in time, and provided for us when time shall
   be no more; the beginning of this treaty with us, the progress of his
   work, the many failings we were guilty of, his patience in bearing with
   us, his goodness in hearing us, his giving, forgiving, keeping us from
   dangers, in dangers, and deliverances out of dangers. What supplies and
   supports we have had, what visits of love, warnings., awakenings of
   heart!

   3. Let us trace the benefits we enjoy to the fountain of them, the love
   of God; then we will say, Ps. cxxxviii. 2, I will praise thy name for
   thy loving-kindness and truth.' This is not only to drink of the
   stream, but of the fountain; there the water is sweetest; when we see
   all this coming from the special love of God to our souls. Otherwise
   God may give in anger: Hosea xiii. 11, I gave them a king in mine
   anger;' as he gave the Israelites meat for their lusts: Isa. xxxviii.
   17, Thou hast loved me from the grave;' this commendeth all
   experiences, maketh us love God again.

   4. Compare yourselves with others your betters, who would be glad of
   your leavings,--their nature, disposition, endowments better than
   yours, yet receive less from God. He hath not dealt so with any nation.
   Whence is all this to me? John xiv. 22, Lord, how is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?' Many would be glad of
   our relics.

   5. Consider your unworthiness: Gen. xxxii. 10, I am not worthy of the
   least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast showed
   unto thy servant;' 2 Sam. vii. 18, Who am I, O Lord, and what is my
   house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?' Pride is the cause of
   discontent. Where all is received freely, there is no cause of
   discontent: much of giving thanks if we have anything. When we look to
   desert, we may wonder more at what we have than what we want: if
   afflicted, destitute, kept low and bare, it is a wonder we are not in
   hell. All this is spoken because men are not thankful, We are eager
   till we have blessings, but when we have them, then barren in praises,
   unfruitful in obedience: like little children, forward to beg favours,
   but careless to acknowledge what they have received.

   Doct. 3. That in our thankful acknowledgments we should take notice of
   God's truth, as well as his benignity and goodness. David owned the
   kindness as coming according to his word. So do the servants of God
   observe his accomplishing promises: Josh, xxiii. 14, And, behold, this
   day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts
   and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good
   things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all hath come to
   pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.' So Solomon: 1 Kings
   viii. 56, Blessed be God that giveth rest to his people Israel,
   according to all that he promised; there hath not failed one word of
   all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his
   servant.' Thus Joshua and Solomon observe how his word was made good to
   a tittle, and in the rigour of the letter; he hath not left undone
   anything, but accomplished all to the full. A great deal of benefit
   will come by it:--

   1. For yourselves.

   [1.] Your own faith will be confirmed by it, when you see that God is
   as good as his word, and bestoweth upon us the utmost that any promise
   of his giveth us to hope for: it is dictum factum with God; he is no
   more liberal in word than in deed. Look, as it confirmeth our faith in
   the truth of the threatenings, when we are punished as our congregation
   hath heard, Hosea vii. 12,--they that would not believe their danger
   are made to feel it,--so our faith in the promise. God showeth what he
   will be to his servants, and after a little waiting they find it to be
   so. Wait but a little while, and you shall find the effect of the
   promises: Ps. lvi. 8, In God I will praise his word, in the Lord I will
   praise his word:' that is, I have great cause to take notice of the
   promise; to a believer it is as good as performance: so Ps. xix. 9, The
   judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.' Former
   experience begets confidence for the time to come: the Lord doth not
   deceive us with vain words. There is an effect in them; I shall find
   it; what God saith he doth.

   [2.] Your comfort is increased; receiving things in a way of promise
   sweeteneth a blessing. It is good to see whence things come to us, from
   the bounty of common providence, or from the promises of the covenant.
   There is a providential right and a covenant right. Devils hold their
   beings by a providential right, but the saints their blessings by
   covenant. The promise is made to God's servants, and the mercy conveyed
   by the promise is sanctified: 1 Cor. iii. 23, All are yours, and ye are
   Christ's, and Christ is God's;' 1 Tim. iv. 3, they are to be received
   with thanksgiving of them that believe and know the truth.' Believers
   are called heirs of promise,' Some blessings the very nature of them
   showeth whence they come; but in others, as the deliverances and
   comforts of this life, the tenure of them is more comfortable than the
   mercies themselves; to have them not only from God's hand but heart.
   Wicked men have them as their portion, you as helps to your better
   portion: heirs of promise is an honourable title and relation. Such
   blessings are from love, and for our good.

   2. As to others, you will invite, encourage, and strengthen them in
   believing. You are witnesses of his fidelity: Ps. xviii. 30, As for
   God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried.' I can assure
   you I have found more than letters and syllables in a promise, it is a
   tried word; I can tell you what God hath done for my soul.

   Use. Let us look to the accomplishment of these promises, and trust God
   the more for the future. Make much of promises: Heb. xi. 13, These all
   died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
   afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them.' They are sure
   declarations of the purposes of God. God's purposes are immutable, but
   promises declared lay an obligation upon him to keep them. Rejoice in
   them till performance cometh. Take heed of setting sense against them:
   Rom. iv. 18-21, Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become
   the father of many, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy
   seed be: and being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
   now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
   deadness of Sarah's womb: he staggered not at the promise through
   unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully
   persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform.'
   Naturally men are all for having before them. Take heed of haste: Ps.
   cxvi. 11, I said in my haste, All men are liars;' Ps. xxxi. 22, I said
   in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes.'

SERMON LXXIV.

   Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
   commandments.--Ver. 66.

   THE man of God had acknowledged that God had done good for him; now he
   beggeth the continuance of his goodness. God, that hath showed mercy,
   will show mercy. His treasure is not spent by giving, nor hath he the
   less for communicating to the creature. Man will say, I have given you
   already, why do you trouble me any more? But God upbraideth no man; the
   more frequent our suits are for grace, the more welcome we are: Thou
   hast done good for thy servant:' and now again, Teach me good judgment
   and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.

   In the words observe--

   1. The blessing asked, Teach me good judgment and knowledge.

   2. The reason urged, for I have believed thy commandments.

   I begin with the prayer or blessing asked, Teach me good judgment and
   knowledge.' Let us consider a little the different translations of this
   clause. The Septuagint hath three words chresto'teta, paideian, kai`
   gnosin, goodness, discipline, and knowledge; others, bonitatem gustus
   et scientiae doce me, teach me goodness of taste and knowledge;
   Ainsworth, Vatablus, bonitatem sensus, learn me goodness of reason and
   knowledge. In the original Hebrew tvv tm, the Hebrew word signifieth
   taste or savour, so it is translated Ps. xxxiv. 8, Oh taste and see
   that the Lord is good.' The word also signifieth behaviour, as Ps.
   xxxiv. title, A Psalm of David when he changed his behaviour before
   Abimelech.' For a man is tasted by his carriage, and some think it may
   mean goodness of inclination or manners. I think we fitly translate it
   judgment, it being coupled with a word that signifieth
   knowledge--taste, by a metaphor from the bodily sense, being applied to
   the mind; as meats are discerned by the taste, so things by the
   judgment; and so that which David beggeth here is a good or exact
   judgment, or the faculty of judging well.

   Doct. That a judicious sound mind is a great blessing, and should
   earnestly be sought of God by all that would please him.

   The man of God renewing this request so often, and his calling it here
   good judgment and knowledge, will warrant this observation, and
   sufficiently showeth how good it is to have the mind illuminated and
   endowed with the true knowledge of things. In handling this point, I
   shall show--

   1. What is the use of a sound mind.

   2. Why this should be so often and earnestly asked.

   First, What is the use of a sound mind? There is a threefold act of
   judgment:--

   1. To distinguish.

   2. To determine.

   3. To direct and order.

   1. To distinguish and judge rightly of things that differ, that we may
   not mistake error for truth, and evil for good. So the apostle maketh
   it the great work of judgment to discern between good and evil: Heb. v.
   14, But strong meat belongeth to those that are of full age, even those
   who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good
   and bad.' The things that are to be judged are true and false, right
   and wrong, necessary or indifferent, expedient or inexpedient, fit or
   unfit; for many things are lawful that are not expedient: 1 Cor. vi.
   12, All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient,' as
   to time, place, persons. Well, then, judgment is a spirit of discerning
   truth from falsehood, good from evil, that we may approve what is good,
   and disallow the contrary. So the spiritual man judgeth all things, 1
   Cor. ii. 15; that is, though he hath not an authoritative judgment, he
   hath a judgment of discretion; and if he did stir up this gift of
   discerning, he might more easily understand his duty, and how far he is
   concerned in point of conscience and in order to salvation. So 1 Cor.
   x. 15, I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.' The spiritually
   wise, if they would awaken the gifts of grace received in regeneration
   by diligence and prayer and needfulness of soul, might sooner come to a
   resolution of their doubts than they usually do. As bodily taste doth
   discern things savoury from unsavoury, profitable from noxious, so is
   judgment given us that we may distinguish between the poisons which the
   world offereth in a golden cup to impure souls, and that wholesome
   spiritual milk which we suck out of the breasts of scripture, between
   savoury food and hurtful diet, how neatly soever cooked. The soul's
   taste is more necessary than the body's, as the soul is the better
   part, and as our danger is greater, and errors there cost us dearer.

   2. To determine and resolve, practicum dictamen. The taste of the soul
   is for God, that bindeth our duty upon us, when there is a decree
   issued forth in the soul, that after we know our duty there may be a
   resolvedness of mind never to swerve from it. First the distinguishing
   work proceedeth; there is a clear and distinct approbation of God; then
   the determining followeth; this is the pro'thesis kardi'as, Acts xi.
   23, The purpose of heart;' 2 Tim. iii. 10, Thou hast known fully my
   doctrine, manner of life,' pro'thesin, purpose. The form of this decree
   and resolution you have in Ps. lxxiii. 28, But it is good for me to
   draw near to God.' This in the soul hath the authority of a principle.
   He that meaneth to be a thorough Christian must set the bent and bias
   and purpose of his heart strongly upon it: Ps. xxxix. 1, I said, I will
   take heed to my ways.' So Ps. xxxii. 5, I said, I will confess mine
   iniquities.' These purposes have a powerful command upon the whole
   soul, to set it a-working whatever they purpose with this strong
   decree, how backward soever the heart be otherwise; they will excite
   and quicken us, and admit of no contradiction. It is our judgments lead
   us and guide and poise us. A man may have knowledge and learning, and
   play the fool if his judgment be not biassed: a man never taketh any
   course but his judgment telleth him it is best, and best for him all
   things considered. It is not men's knowledge leadeth them, but their
   judgments say to their wills, This is not for me; the other conduceth
   most to my profit, honour, or delight: but when the judgment is in some
   measure set towards God, then the man is for God.

   3. To direct as well as to decree; so good judgment and knowledge
   serveth for the right guiding of ourselves and all our affairs. Many
   are wise in generals that err in particulars, and have a knowledge of
   principles, but their affairs are under no conduct. Particulars are
   nearer to practice, and very learned men are deceived in particulars:
   Rom. ii. 20-22, An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which
   hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law: thou therefore
   which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest
   a man should not steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man should
   not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest
   idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?' Therefore, besides the general
   rule, the knowledge of God's will, it is necessary to have the gift of
   discretion, when particulars are clothed with circumstances. There is
   an infinite variety of circumstances which require a deal of prudence
   to determine them. A man may easily discourse on general truths
   concerning God, ourselves, the state of the church, the privileges of
   Christianity; but to direct them to particular cases, to govern our own
   hearts, and order our own ways, that is a harder thing: Hosea xiv. 9,
   Whoso is wise and prudent,' &c.; Prov. viii. 12, I, wisdom, dwell with
   prudence.' To direct is harder than to determine or distinguish. It is
   easier to distinguish of good and evil in the general, to lay down
   conclusions upon the evidence of the goodness of the ways of God; but
   to reduce our knowledge to practice in all cases, that is the great
   work of judgment, that we may know what becometh the time, the place,
   the company where we are, and may have that ordering of our
   conversation aright, Ps. l. 23; to know how to carry ourselves in all
   relations, business, civil, sacred, light, serious; that we neither
   offend in excess nor defect; that we judge what is due to the Creator,
   and what is to be allowed to the creature; what is good, what is
   better, what is best of all; that we know how to pay reverence to
   superiors, how most profitably to converse with equals, what compassion
   to inferiors, how to do good to them; how to behave our selves as
   husbands, wives, fathers, children. Wisdom maketh us profitable in our
   relations: 1 Peter iii. 7, Let husbands dwell with wives according to
   knowledge.' There is much prudence and wisdom required to know how to
   converse profitably and Christianly with all that we have to do with.
   In short, how to love our friends in God, and our enemies for God; how
   to converse secretly with God, and to walk openly before men; how to
   cherish the flesh that it may not be unserviceable, yet how to mortify
   it that it may not wax wanton against the spirit; how to do all things
   in the fear of God, in meats, drinks, apparel, recreations; when and
   how to pray, what time for our callings, what for worship; when to
   speak, when to hold our peace; when to praise, and when to reprove; how
   to give, and how to take; when to scatter, when to keep back or
   withhold; and to order all things aright requireth a sound judgment,
   that we carry ourselves with that gravity and seriousness, that
   exactness and tenderness, that we may keep up the majesty of religion,
   and all the world may know that he is wise by whose counsel we are
   guided. But alas! where this sound judgment an4 discretion is wanting,
   we shall soon offend and transgress the laws of piety, charity,
   justice, sobriety. Piety and godliness will not be orderly; we shall
   either be guilty of a profane neglect of that course of duty that is
   necessary to keep in the life of grace, or turn religion into a sour
   superstition and rigorous course of observances. Charity will not be
   orderly; we shall give to wastefulness, or withhold more than is meet,
   to the scandal or prejudice of the world towards religion. Not perform
   justice; we shall govern to God's dishonour, obey to his wrong, punish
   with too much severity, or forbear with too much lenity; our reproofs
   will be reproaches, our praises flattery. Sobriety will not be orderly;
   we shall deny ourselves our necessary comforts, or use them as an
   occasion to the flesh; either afflict the body and make ourselves
   unserviceable, or wrong the soul and burden and oppress it with vain
   delights. It short, even the higher acts of religion will degenerate;
   our fear will be turned into desperation, or our hope into presumption;
   our faith will be a light credulity, or our search after truth will
   turn into a flat scepticism or irresolution; our patience will be
   stupidness, or our constancy obstinacy; we shall either slight the hand
   of God, or faint under it; so that there is need of good judgment and
   knowledge to guide us in all our ways.

   Secondly, Why this is so earnestly to be sought of God. The thing is
   evident from what is said already. But further--

   1. Because this is a great defect in most Christians, who have many
   times good affections, but no prudence to guide and order them; they
   are indeed all affection, but no judgment; have a zeal, but without
   knowledge, Rom. x. 3. Zeal should be like fire, which is not only
   fervidus, but lucidus, hot, but bright. A blind horse may be full of
   mettle, but he is ever and anon stumbling. Oh! then, should we not
   earnestly seek of God good knowledge and judgment? The Spirit of God
   knoweth what is best for us. In the scriptures he hath indited prayers:
   Phil. i. 9, This I pray, that your love may abound more and more, in
   knowledge, and in all judgment;' that our love and zeal should have a
   proportionable measure of knowledge and judgment going along with it;
   and Col. i. 9, That ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in
   all wisdom and spiritual understanding;' and again, Col. iii. 16, Let
   the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom.' These places show
   that it is not enough to have warm affections, but we must have a clear
   and a sound mind.

   2. The mischief which ariseth from this defect is so great to
   themselves, to others, and the church of God.

   [1.] To themselves.

   (1.) Without the distinguishing or discerning act of judgment, how apt
   are we to be misled and deceived! They that cannot distinguish meats
   will soon eat what is unwholesome; so, if we have not a judgment to
   approve things that are excellent, and disapprove the contrary, our
   fancies will deceive us, for they are taken with every slight
   appearance; as Eve was deceived by the fruit because it was fair to see
   to, Gen. iii. 6, with 2 Cor. xi. 3, For I fear lest by any means, as
   the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be
   corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.' Our affections will
   deceive us, for they judge by interest and profit, not duty and
   conscience. The affections are easily bribed by those bastard goods of
   pleasure, honour, and profit: 2 Cor. iv. 4, In whom the god of this
   world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.' The consent of
   the world will deceive us, for they may conspire in error and,
   rebellion against God, and are usually the opposite party against God:
   Rom. xii. 2, And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed
   by the renewing of your minds.' Good men may deceive us; true and
   faithful ministers may err both in doctrine and manners, as the old
   prophet seduced the young one to his own destruction: 1 Kings xiii. 18,
   He paid unto him, I am a prophet also, and an angel spake unto me by
   the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house,
   that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.' In what a
   woful plight, then, are Christians if they have not a judgment, and a
   test to taste [4] doctrines and try things, as the mouth tasteth meats!
   How easily shall we take good for evil and evil for good, condemning
   that which God approveth, and approving that which God condemneth!

   (2.) Without the determining act of judgment, how fickle and irresolute
   shall we be, either in the profession or in the practice of godliness.
   Many men's religion lasts but for a pang; it cometh upon them now and
   then, it is not their constant frame and constitution. For want of this
   purpose and resolute peremptory decree for the profession of godliness,
   there is an uncertainty, levity, and wavering in religion: men take up
   opinions lightly, and leave them as lightly again. Light chaff is
   carried about with every wind: Eph. iv. 14, That we henceforth be no
   more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
   doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they
   lie in wait to deceive.' If we receive the truth upon the credit of
   men, we may be led off again, and we shall be ready to stagger when
   persecution cometh, especially if we see those men from whom we have
   learned the truth fall away; if we have not i'dion ste'rigmon, a
   steadfastness of our own: 2 Peter iii. 17, Beware lest ye also, being
   led away by the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.'
   Men should have a steadfastness proper to themselves, not stand by the
   steadfastness of another, the examples of others, the countenance or
   applause of the world, or the opinion of good men; but convincing
   reason, by which their minds may be enlightened, and their judgments
   set for God. So for practice; we are off and on, unstable in all our
   ways, Why? Because we content ourselves with some good motions before
   we have brought our hearts to this conclusion, to choose God for our
   portion, and to cleave to him. All in haste they will be religious, but
   sudden imperfect motions may be easily laid aside, and given over by
   contrary persuasions; but when our hearts are fixed upon these holy
   purposes, then all contrary solicitations and oppositions will not
   break us or divert us. Satan hath small hopes to seduce or mislead a
   resolved Christian; loose and unengaged men lie open to him, and are
   ready to be entertained and employed by any new master.

   (3.) Without the directing act of judgment, how easily shall we
   miscarry, and make religion a burden to ourselves, or else a scorn to
   the world! Want of judgment causeth different effects, not only in
   divers, but in the same person: sometimes a superstitious
   scrupulousness, at other times a profane negligence; sometimes making
   conscience of all things, then of nothing: as the one weareth off, the
   other succeedeth: as the devil cast the lunatic in the Gospel sometimes
   into the water, sometimes into the fire; either fearful of sin in
   everything they do, or bold to run into all sin without fear; whereas a
   truth judiciously understood would prevent either extreme. So again for
   want of judgment; sometimes men are transported by a fiery and
   indiscreet zeal, at other times settle into a cold indifferency, and
   all things come alike to them. The way to prevent both is to resolve
   upon evidence: 1 Thes. v. 21, Prove all things, hold fast that which is
   good.' Certainly the clearer our judgment is the more steadfast is our
   faith, the more vehement our love, the more sound our joy, the more
   constant our hope, the more calm our patience, the more earnest our
   pursuit of true happiness; otherwise we shall never carry it evenly
   between vain presumption and feigned reverence, between legal fear and
   rash hopes, uncomely dejections and a loose disregard of God. Wisdom is
   the faculty by which we apply that knowledge we have unto the end why
   we should have it.

   [2.] It makes us troublesome to others, by preposterous carriage, rash
   censuring, needless intermeddling: Phil. i. 9, 10, And this I pray,
   that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all
   judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be
   sincere and without offence till the day of Christ:' our corruptions
   will otherwise break forth to the offence of others. An injudicious
   Christian increaseth the reproaches of the world, as if the servants of
   God were the troublers of Israel, by unseasonable reproofs, mistiming
   of duties, meddling with that which no ways appertaineth to him. All
   lawful things are not fit at all times, nor in all places, nor to be
   done by all persons. Much folly, indiscretion and rashness remaineth in
   the best, whereby they dishonour God, and bring religion into contempt.

   [3.] They trouble the church of God; it hath suffered not only from the
   persecutions of enemies, but from the folly, rashness, and indiscretion
   of its friends. There are different degrees of light, some babes, some
   young men, some grown persons in Christ Jesus: 1 John ii. 13, I write
   unto you fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning;
   I write unto you young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one; I
   write unto you little children, because ye have known the Father.' Now,
   children have their fancies, and young men their passions, and old men
   their humours. When the one would prescribe to the other, they hurry
   all things into confusion: the injudicious generally seek to carry it,
   and would govern the world. In young ones, there are great affections
   but little knowledge and judgment; they have a great zeal, but little
   prudence to moderate it; and when this is joined with perverseness and
   contumacy, it is not easy to be said how much evil it bringeth to the
   church of God; as a fiery horse routeth the troop, and bringeth
   disorder into the army. The devil loveth to draw things into extremes,
   to set gift against gift, prudence against zeal, the youth of
   Christianity against age, and so to confound all things, and so to
   subvert the kingdom of Christ by that comely vanity which is the beauty
   of it. In the general, all overdoing in religion is undoing.

   Use. The use is, let all this press us to seek this benefit of good
   judgment and knowledge. To this end--

   1. Consider the value and necessity of it. Without it we cannot
   regularly comfort ourselves in the promises, but it will breed a
   carelessness and neglect of our duty; nor fulfil the commandments of
   God, but it will breed in us a self-confidence and disvaluing of the
   grace of God; nor reflect upon our sins, but we shall be swallowed up
   of immoderate sorrow; nor suffer for the truth, but we shall run into
   indiscreet reasoning and oppositions that will trouble all, and, it may
   be, subvert the interest of religion in the world; or else grow into a
   loose uncertainty, leaping from one opinion to another. This
   uncertainty cometh not so much, or not altogether, from vile affection,
   as want of information in religion, professing without light and
   evidence, having more of affection than principles. There is a twofold
   injudiciousness--total or partial. (1.) Total, when men are given up
   eis noun ado'kimon, into a reprobate sense, or an injudicious mind,
   Rom. i. 28: when utterly incapable of heavenly doctrine, or discerning
   the things of the Spirit. This is one of God's heaviest judgments. That
   is not the case of any of you, I hope. (2.) Partial, and that is in us
   all. Alas! we are ignorant of many things which we should know; at
   least, we have not that discretion and prudence which is necessary for
   directing our faith, tempering our zeal, ordering and regulating our
   practice, which is necessary to avoid evil, to do good, or to do good
   well. Or, if we have light, we have no sense or taste. Many never felt
   the bitterness of sin to purpose, of sweetness of righteousness;
   therefore we have need to cry to God, Lord, give me good taste and
   knowledge.

   2. If you would have it, you must ask it of God. We can have no sound
   knowledge till God teach it us. By nature we are all blind, ignorant,
   vain; after grace received, though our ignorance be helped, it is not
   altogether cured; you must still fetch it from heaven by strong hand.
   Without his Spirit we cannot discern spiritual things: 1 Cor. ii. 14,
   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
   are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned;' that is, chiefly, the main things of the
   gospel, and universally all things, so far as conscience and obedience
   to God is concerned in them. It is the unction must teach us all
   things: 1 John ii. 20, But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye
   know all things;' the things of God must be seen in the light of his
   own Spirit. The Spirit of God first giveth us the desire of these
   things, and then satisfieth us with them. It is the Spirit of God
   purifieth this desire, that it may be holy, as having a holy end, that
   we may avoid whatever is displeasing to God, and do whatever is
   pleasing in his sight; and that is the ready way to come to knowledge
   and sound judgment: John xvii. 17, Sanctify them through thy truth; thy
   word is truth;' John iii. 21, He that doeth truth cometh to the light,
   that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.' Men
   that have a mind to maintain an opinion, or suffer an evil practice,
   are prejudiced and biassed by the idol that is in their hearts, and so
   do not see what may be seen, and what they seem to search after.
   Therefore David urgeth this as an argument in the latter end of the
   text, I have believed thy commandments;' that is to say, Lord, I know
   this word is thine, and I am willing to practise all that thou
   requirest. The great thing that is to be aimed at about knowledge is,
   not only that we may know, and be able to jangle about questions, or
   that we may be known and esteemed for our knowledge, but that we may
   practise and walk circumspectly, and in evil days and times know what
   the will of the Lord is concerning us; to desire knowledge as those
   that know the weight and consequence of these things, as I shall show
   more fully hereafter. Those that would have good judgment and knowledge
   must be willing to understand their duty, and practise all that God
   requireth, that they may neither do things rashly, and without
   knowledge and deliberation, for then they are not good, how good soever
   they be in themselves: Prov. xix. 2, Also, that the soul be without
   knowledge is not good:' or doubtingly, after deliberation; for he that
   doubteth is in part condemned in his own mind: Rom. xiv. 23, And he
   that doubteth is damned if he eat.' We must have a clear warrant from
   God, or else all is naught, and will tend to evil. Then it is the
   Spirit of God satisfieth these desires, when we earnestly desire of him
   to be informed in the true and perfect way: John vi. 45, They shall be
   all taught of God.' He hath suited promises to the pure and earnest
   desire of knowledge. Then it is the Lord who sendeth means and blesseth
   means; as he sent Peter to Cornelius, Acts x., and Philip to the
   eunuch, Acts viii. All is at his disposal, and he will not fail the
   waiting soul; he hath made Christ to be wisdom for this very end and
   purpose, that he might guide us continually: 1 Cor. i. 30, But of him
   are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification and redemption.'

   3. You must seek it in the word; that maketh us wise to salvation, and
   by the continual study of it we obtain wisdom and discretion; there we
   have the best and safest counsel: It maketh wise the simple,' Ps. xix.
   7. No case can be put, so far as it concerneth conscience, but there
   you shall have satisfaction: Col. iii. 16, Let the word of God dwell in
   you richly in all wisdom.' You must not content yourselves with a
   cursory reading, but mark the end and scope of it, that you may be made
   completely wise, by frequent reading, hearing, meditation upon it, and
   conferring about it. There you find all things necessary to be believed
   and practised, therefore you must hear it with application, read it
   with meditation. (1.) Hear it with application. The Lord blesseth us in
   the use of instituted means; both light and flame are kept in by the
   breath of preaching. Where visions fail, the people perish, men grow
   brutish and wild. It is a dispute which is the sense of learning, the
   ear or the eye. By the eye we see things, but by reason of innate
   ignorance we must be taught how to judge of them: James i. 19,
   Wherefore, my brethren, let every man be swift to hear;' take all
   occasions. And we must still apply what we hear. Nunquid ego talis?
   Rom. viii. 31, What shall we then say to these things?' Job v. 27, Lo,
   this we have searched, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy
   good;' Heb. ii. 3, How shall we escape if we neglect so great
   salvation?' Return upon thine own heart. (2.) Reading scripture is
   every man's work who hath a soul to be saved. Other writings, though
   good in their kind, will not leave such a lively impression upon the
   soul. All the moral sentences of Seneca and Plutarch do not come with
   such force upon the conscience as one saying of God's word. God's
   language hath a special energy; here must be your study and your
   delight: Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his
   law doth he meditate day and night;' 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17, All scripture
   is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
   reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man
   of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.' These
   make you wise unto salvation. Your taste is not right when you relish
   and savour human writings, though never so good, more than the word of
   God. A draught of wine from the vessel is more fresh and lively; that
   conviction which doth immediately rise out of the word is more
   prevailing. We suspect the mixture of passion and private aims in the
   writings of others; but when conscience and the word are working
   together, we own it as coming from God himself. Besides, those that are
   studying, and reading, and meditating on the word have this sensible
   advantage, that they have promises, doctrines, examples of the word
   ready and familiar upon all occasions; others are weak and unsettled
   because they have not scriptures ready. In the whole work of grace you
   will find no weapon so effectual as the sword of the Spirit. Scriptures
   seasonably remembered and urged are a great relief to the soul. No
   diligence here can be too much. If you would not be unprofitable,
   sapless, indiscreet with others, weak and comfortless in yourselves,
   read the scriptures. We have Sic scriptum est against every temptation.
   Besides, you have the advantage to see with your own eyes the truth as
   it cometh immediately from God, before any art of man, or thoughts of
   their head pass upon it, and so can the better own God in what you
   find.

   4. Long use and exercise doth much increase judgment, especially as it
   is sanctified by the Spirit of God. You get a habit of discerning,
   fixing, directing, guiding your ways: dia ten hexin ta aistheteria
   gegumnasmena echontes, Heb. v. 14, Who by reason of use have their
   senses exercised to discern good and evil.' As men of full age, by long
   use and exercise of the senses of seeing, smelling, tasting, have
   acquired a more perfect knowledge to discern what food is good and
   wholesome and what is unwholesome, so by much attention, studying, and
   meditation, men who have exercised the intellectual faculty to find out
   the scope and meaning of the word of God do attain a more discerning
   faculty, and understand better the truth of the word, and can judge
   what doctrine is true and what false, and more easily apprehend higher
   points when taught unto them; they discern and know the differences of
   things to be understood. God's blessing doth accompany use and frequent
   exercise, and make it effectual to this end; by degrees we come to a
   solidness.

   5. Sense and experience doth much increase judgment. When smarted for
   our folly, tasted the sweetness of conversing with God in Christ: 1
   Peter ii. 3, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' Optima
   demonstratio est a sensibus. Col. i. 6, Which bringeth forth fruit, as
   it doth also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace
   of God in truth.' God is not taught by experience, to whose knowledge
   all things are present, and at all times, and before all times; but we
   are. God is fain to teach us by briars and thorns, as Gideon taught the
   men of Succoth.

   6. Avoid the enemies to it or hindrances of it. I shall name two:--

   [1.] A passionate or wilful addictedness to any carnal things. Most men
   live by sense, will, and passion, whereby they enthral that wisdom
   which they have, and keep it in unrighteousness. Perit omne judicium
   cum res transit in affectum--truth is a prisoner to their sinful
   passions and affections, rejecting all thoughts of their future
   happiness. A man cannot be wise to salvation, and passionately addicted
   to any temporal interest.

   [2.] Pride; that maketh us either rash or presumptuous, either not
   using a due consideration, or not humble enough to subject our minds to
   it. Besides we cast off God's assistance: The humble and meek will he
   guide in judgment; the meek will he teach his way,' Ps. xxv. 9. Men
   that lean on their own understandings reject him: Prov. iii. 5, 6,
   Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own
   understanding: in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.'

SERMON LXXV.

   For I have believed thy commandments.--Ver. 66.

   THIS latter clause may be considered absolutely or relatively; in
   itself, or as it containeth a reason of the foregoing petition.

   First, Absolutely. These words deserve a little consideration, because
   believing is here suited with an unusual object. Had it been, For I
   have believed thy promises, or, obeyed thy commandments, the sense of
   the clause had been more obvious to every vulgar apprehension. To
   believe commandments sounds as harsh to a common ear as to see with the
   ear and hear with the eye. But for all this, the commandments are the
   object; and of them he saith not, I have obeyed, but I have believed.
   To take off the seeming asperity of the phrase, some interpreters
   conceive that commandments is put for the word in general; and so
   promises are included, yea, they think principally intended, those
   promises which encouraged him to hope for God's help in all necessary
   things, such as good judgment and knowledge are. But this
   interpretation would divert us from the weight and force of these
   significant words. Therefore--

   1. Certainly there is a faith in the commandments, as well as in the
   promises, as I shall fully prove by and by.

   2. The one is as necessary as the other; for as the promises are not
   esteemed, embraced, and improved, unless they are believed to be of
   God, so neither are the precepts; they do not sway the conscience as
   the other do, nor incline the affections, but as they are believed to
   be divine.

   3. The faith of the one must be as lively as the other. As the promises
   are not believed with a lively faith unless they draw off the heart
   from carnal vanities to seek that happiness which they offer to us, so
   the precepts are not believed rightly unless we be fully resolved to
   acquiesce in them as the only rule to guide us in the obtaining that
   happiness, and to adhere to them and obey them. As the king's laws are
   not kept as soon as they are believed to be the king's laws, unless
   also upon the consideration of his authority and power we subject
   ourselves to them, so this believing noteth a ready alacrity to hear
   God's voice and obey it, and to govern our hearts and actions according
   to his counsel and direction in the word.

   Doct. That the commandments of God must be believed as well as his
   promises; or, The precepts of sanctity and holiness bind the conscience
   to obey God, as well as the promises bind us to trust in God.

   1. What we must believe concerning the commandments.

   2. The necessity of believing them if we would be happy.

   3. The utility and profit.

   1. What we must believe concerning the commandments.

   [1.] That they have God for their author, that we may take our duty
   immediately out of his hand, that these commands are his commands. The
   expressions of his commanding and legislative will, whereby our duty is
   determined and bound upon us, that is a matter of faith, not a matter
   of sense. We were not present at the giving of the law as being past,
   but we ought to be affected with it as if we were present, or had heard
   the thunderings of Mount Sinai, or had them now delivered to us by
   oracle or immediate voice from heaven. God doth once for all give the
   world sensible and sufficient satisfaction, and then he requireth
   faith. See Heb. ii. 2-4, For if the word spoken by angels was
   steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience obtained a just
   recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great
   salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness
   both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the
   Holy Ghost, according to his own will?' The apostle compareth the first
   promulgation of the law and the first publication of the gospel. After
   ages did not hear the sounding of the dreadful trumpet, nor see the
   flaming smoking mountain, were not conscious to all those circumstances
   of terror and majesty with which the law was given; yet it was lo'gos
   be'baios, a steadfast word. God owned it in his providence: the
   punishment of transgressors is proof of God's authorising the doctrine.
   So we were not present when the miracles by which the gospel law was
   confirmed were wrought; yet there is a constant evidence that these
   things were once done; and God still owneth it in his providence,
   therefore we must receive the gospel law as the sovereign will and
   pleasure of our lawgiver, as if we had seen him in person doing these
   wonders, heard him with our own ears. It is not only those that were
   present at Mount Sinai that were bound, but all their posterity. God
   giveth arguments of sense once for all. This belief is the more
   required of us as to precepts and commandments, because they are more
   evident by natural light: Rom. ii. 14, 15, For when the Gentiles, which
   have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these,
   having not the law, are a law unto themselves; which show the work of
   the law written in their hearts.' There is veritas naturalis and
   veritas mystica. Some objects of faith depend upon mere revelation, but
   the commands of the moral law are clearer than the doctrines of faith;
   they are of duties and things present, not of privileges to be enjoyed
   hereafter, such as the promises offer to us. Now, it is easier to be
   convinced of present duties than to be assured of some future things
   promised.

   [2.] That these commandments be received with that reverence that
   becometh the sovereign will and pleasure of so great a lord and law
   giver. It is the work of faith to acquaint us with the nature of God
   and his attributes, and work the sense of them into our hearts. The
   great governor of the world is invisible, and we do not see him that is
   invisible but by faith: Heb. xi. 27, By faith he forsook Egypt, not
   fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is
   invisible.' It is e'lenchos ou blepome'non, the evidence of things not
   seen,' Heb. xi. 1. Temporal potentates are before your eyes, their
   majesty may be seen, and their terrors and rewards are matter of sense.
   That there is an infinite, eternal, and all-wise Spirit, who made all
   things, and therefore hath right to command and give laws to all
   things, reason will in part tell us; but faith doth more assure the
   soul of it, and impresseth the dread and awe of God upon our souls, as
   if we did see him with bodily eyes. By faith we believe his being: Heb.
   xi. 6, He that cometh to God must believe that he is.' His power, so as
   to oppose it to things visible and sensible: Rom. iv. 21, Being fully
   persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform.' That
   there is no standing out against him who with one beck of his will can
   ruin us everlastingly, and throw the transgressor of his laws into
   eternal fire: a frown of his face is enough to undo us; he is not a God
   to be neglected, or dallied with, or provoked by the wilful breaking of
   his laws. He hath truly potestatem vitae et necis--the power of life
   and death: James iv. 12, There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and
   to destroy.' These considerations are best enforced by faith, without
   which our notions of these things are weak and languid. You are to
   charge the heart with God's authority, as you will answer it to him
   another day, not to neglect or despise the duty you owe to such a God.
   No terror comparable to his frowns, no comforts comparable to his
   promises or the sense of his favour.

   [3.] That these laws are holy, just, and good: Rom. vii. 12, Wherefore
   the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.' This is
   necessary, because, in believing the commandments, not only assent is
   required, but also consent to them, as the fittest laws we could be
   governed by: Rom. vii. 16, If, then, I do that which I would not, I
   consent to the law that it is good.' Consent is a mixed act of the
   judgment and will: they are not only to be known as God's laws, but
   owned and embraced, not only see a truth, but a worth in them. The
   mandatory part of the word hath its own loveliness and invitation; as
   the promises of pardon and eternal life suit with the hunger and thirst
   of conscience, and the natural desires of happiness; so the holiness
   and righteousness of God's laws suit with the natural notions of good
   and evil that are in man's heart. These laws were written upon man's
   heart at his first creation, and though somewhat blurred, we know the
   better how to read a defaced writing when we get another copy or
   transcript to compare with it. Especially when the heart is renewed,
   when the Spirit hath wrought a suitableness, there must needs be a
   consenting and embracing: Heb. viii. 10, This is the covenant that 1
   will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I
   will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.'
   There is a ready willing heart to obey them and conform to them in the
   regenerate, therefore an assent is not enough, but a consent; this is
   that they would choose and prefer before liberty; they acquiesce and
   are satisfied in their rule as the best rule for them to live by. But
   let us see the three attributes, holy, just, and good. (1.) They are
   holy laws, fit for God to give and man to receive. When we are
   convinced of this, it is a great help to bridle contrary inclinations,
   and to carry us on cheerfully in our work. They are fit for God to
   give, they become such a being as God is: his laws carry the express
   print and stamp of his own nature upon them. We may know how agreeable
   they are to the nature of God by supposing the monstrousness of the
   contrary. If he had forbidden us all love, and fear, and trust in
   himself, all respect and thanks to our creator, or bidden us to worship
   false gods, or change the glory of the incorruptible God into an image
   made like to a corruptible man, as birds, four-footed beasts, and
   creeping things, or that we should blaspheme his name continually, or
   despise his glory shining forth in the work of his hands, and that we
   should be disobedient to our parents, and pollute ourselves as the
   beasts with promiscuous lusts, and fill the world with adulteries,
   robberies, and thefts, or slander and revile one another, and leave the
   boat to the stream, give over ourselves to our passions, discontents,
   and the unruly lusts of our corrupt hearts; these are conceits so
   monstrous that, if the beasts were capable of having such thoughts
   transfused into them, they would abhor them, and would infer such a
   manifest disproportion in the soul as it would in the body to walk with
   our hands and do our work with our feet And they are fit for man to
   receive if he would preserve the rectitude of his nature, live as such
   an understanding creature, keep reason in dominion, and free from being
   a slave to the appetites of the body. To be just, holy, temperate,
   humble, meek, chaste, doth not only concern the glory of God and the
   safety of the world, but the liberty of the reasonable nature, that man
   may act as a creature that hath a mind to know things that differ, and
   to keep him from that filthiness and pollution which would be a stain
   to him, and infringe the glory of his being. There is no middle thing;
   either a man must be a saint or a beast, either conform himself to
   God's will, and look after the interests of his soul, or lose the
   excellency of his nature, and become as the beasts that perish; either
   the beast must govern the man, or the man ride upon the beast, which he
   doth when he taketh God's counsel. (2.) Just, because it referreth to
   all God's precepts. I take it here not strictly but largely, how just
   it is for God to command, and how reasonable it is that we should obey
   the supreme being. His will is the reason of all things; and who should
   give laws to the world but the universal sovereign who made all things
   out of nothing? Whatsoever you are, you receive it from the Lord; and
   therefore, whatsoever a reasonable creature can do, you owe it to him:
   you are in continual dependence upon him, for in him you live, and
   move, and have your being,' Acts xvii. 28. And be bath redeemed you,
   called you to life by Christ: 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, What, know you not
   that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which
   ye have of God, and ye are not your own? for ye are bought with a
   price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which
   are God's.' You owe all your time, and strength, and service unto him,
   and therefore you should still be doing his will and abounding in his
   work. (3.) He enjoineth nothing but what is good: Deut. v. 29, Oh, that
   there were such a heart in them that they would fear me, and keep all
   my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their
   children for ever:' Deut. vi. 24, And the Lord commanded us to do all
   these statutes, to fear the Lord our God for our good always, that he
   might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.' God hath tempered his
   sovereignty towards the reasonable creature, and ruleth us not with a
   rod of iron, but with a sceptre of love: He draweth us with the cords
   of a man,' Hosea xi. 4; that is, with reasons and arguments taken from
   our own happiness. Man being a rational and free agent, he would lead
   and quicken us to our duty by the consideration of our own benefit; and
   when he might say only, Thus shall ye do; I am the Lord; yet he is
   pleased to exhort and persuade us not to forsake our own mercies, or to
   turn back upon our own happiness, and to propound rewards that we may
   be encouraged to seek after him in that way of duty which he hath
   prescribed to us. The reward is ever lasting glory, with the mercies of
   this life in order to it: Heb. xi. 6, God is, and he is a rewarder of
   them that diligently seek him.'

   [4.] How indispensably obedience to his commandments is required of us.
   As long as the heart is left loose and arbitrary, such is the
   unruliness and self-willedness of man's nature, Rom. viii. 7, The
   carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of
   God, neither indeed can be.' The carnalist will not be held to his
   duty, but leaves that which is honest for that which is pleasing, and
   is governed by his appetite rather than his reason; therefore faith
   hedgeth up his way, showeth him that without holiness it is impossible
   to see God,' Heb. xii. 14; that there is no coming to the end unless we
   take the way; that there is no hope of exemption or excuse for the
   breaches of his law allowed but the plea of the gospel, which doth not
   evacuate but establish obedience to God's commands, requireth a
   renouncing of our former course, and a hearty resolution, to serve God
   in holiness and righteousness all our days,' Luke i. 74, 75. Our duty
   is the end of our deliverance. In the kingdom of grace we are not our
   own masters, or at liberty to do what we will. Christ came not only as
   a saviour, but as a lawgiver; he hath his laws to try our obedience:
   Heb. v. 9, And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
   salvation unto all them that obey him.' He came not to lessen God's
   sovereignty or man's duty, but to put us into a greater capacity to
   serve God. He came to deliver us from the curse and indispensable
   rigours of the law upon every failing; not from our duty, nor that we
   might not serve God, but serve him without fear, with peace of
   conscience and joy of heart, and requireth such a degree of grace as is
   inconsistent with any predominant lust and affection.

   [5.] That God loveth those that obey his law, and hateth those that
   despise it, without respect of persons: Acts x. 35, In every nation he
   that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted with him;' Ps.
   v. 5, Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity:' Prov. xi. 20, They that
   are of a froward heart are an abomination to the Lord, but such as are
   upright in their way are his delight.' The more obedient, the more God
   loveth us; the less obedient, the less God loveth us. Therefore, unless
   we love what God loveth, and hate what God hateth, do his commands
   carefully, and avoid the contrary, we cannot be acceptable with him,
   for God would not make a law in vain, but order his providence
   accordingly.

   S6.] That one day we shall be called to an account for our conformity
   inconformity to God's law. There are two parts of
   government--legislation and execution: the one belongeth to God as
   king, the other as judge. Laws are but a shadow, and the sanction a
   mockery, unless there shall be a day when those that are subject to
   them shall be called to an account and reckoning. His threatenings are
   not a vain scare crow, nor his promises a golden dream; therefore he
   will appoint a day when the truth of the one and the other shall be
   fully made good; and therefore faith enliveneth the sense of God's
   authority with the remembrance of this day, when he will judge the
   world in righteousness.

   2. The necessity.

   [1.] The precepts are a part of the divine revelation: the object of
   faith is the whole word of God, and every part of divinely inspired
   truth is worthy of all belief and reverence. The word worketh not
   unless it be received as the word of God: 1 Thes. ii. 13, For this
   cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the
   word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of
   men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh
   also in you that believe.' Now we cannot receive the word as the word
   of God unless we receive all. There are the same reasons to receive one
   as the other; therefore, if any part take good rooting, the whole is
   received. There may be a superficial affection to one part more than
   another; but if there be a right faith, we receive all. It is the
   engrafted word that is effectual to the saving of our souls, James i.
   21; if we would engraft the word, the precepts must stir up answerable
   affections as well as the promises. Every part must affect us, and stir
   up dispositions in us which that part is apt to produce. If the
   promises stir up joy and trust, the precepts must stir up love, fear,
   and obedience. The same word which calleth upon us to believe the free
   pardon of our sins, doth also call upon us to believe the commandments
   of God for the regulating and guiding of our hearts and ways.

   [2.] It is such a part as hath a necessary connection with the
   promises, as without which they can do us no good; therefore, if we
   mean to be happy, we must regard both; the one is as necessary and
   fundamental to our happiness as the other. Our consent to God's
   covenant is required, not as if we were to debate and alter the terms
   at our plea sure, but that we may take it as God hath stated it, and
   bind our duty upon us by our consent to God's authority. We cannot
   prescribe conditions and laws of commerce between God and us, but only
   God alone. Man did not give the conditions, or treat about the making
   of them, what they should be, but is only bound to submit to what God
   was pleased to offer and prescribe. We are not left free to model and
   bring down the terms to our own liking, to take hold of them, not to
   appoint them: Isa. lvi. 4, For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs
   that keep my sabbaths, and do the things that please me, and take hold
   of my covenant:' for though he condescendeth to treat with us, yet
   still he keepeth the place of a sovereign: and therefore, if we believe
   promises, and do not believe God's commandments, it is not God's
   covenant, but one of our own devising, when we take and leave, and part
   and mingle, and chop and change at our own pleasures. The covenant
   requireth a total, universal, unlimited resignation of ourselves to the
   will of God: I will be your God, you shall be my people.'

   [3.] The gratitude that resulteth necessarily from faith, or believing
   the promises, will put us upon this; it apprehendeth love, and leaveth
   the stamp of it upon the soul, and worketh by love, Gal. v. 6. Now, how
   are we to express our love to God? Not in a fellow-like familiarity,
   but dutiful subjection to his laws: 1 John v. 3, For this is the love
   of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not
   grievous;' and John xiv. 21, He that hath my commandments, and keepeth
   them, he it is that loveth me:' not by glavering respects, or a fond
   remembrance and esteem of his memory, Mat. vii. 11. If we live to God,
   not to the world, not to the flesh, if faith be lively, it will put us
   upon this: 2 Cor. v. 15, And that he died for all, that they that live
   should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
   them and rose again.'

   [4.] Our trust in the promises is always commensurable to our fidelity
   in the commandments. Faith in the one is maintained by faithfulness in
   the other, and assurance of acceptance with God cannot be greater than
   our care of obedience. When love to the world and the flesh tempt us to
   omit any part of our duty, then do we weaken our confidence thereby,
   and sin will breed distrust if we be serious and mind our condition:
   The fruit of righteousness is peace:' 1 John iii. 21, Beloved, if our
   hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God;' and Heb.
   vii. 2, Being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that
   also king of Salem, which is king of peace:' and Christ saith, Mat. xi.
   29, Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
   heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.' Confidence and comfort
   follow grace, as heat doth fire; and fears and doubts follow sin, as
   pain doth the pricking of a needle, or any sharp thing wherewith a man
   pierceth himself; therefore, when sensual objects oversway us, and take
   us off from obedience to the command, they will also make us doubt of
   the mercy of God, as well as transgress our duty. We cannot trust him
   when we have offended freely and without restraint; sin will breed
   shame and fear.

   At present all sinners feel it not; yet hereafter that sin that now
   weakeneth the faith we have in the commandments, will in time weaken
   the faith we have in the promises. Every part of our trust in God's
   declared will cometh to be tried one time or another: our confidence in
   God's mercy is not fully and directly assaulted till the hour of death,
   and the time of extraordinary trial. When the evil day cometh, then the
   consciousness of any one sin whereunto we have been indulgent, and of
   the delight and pleasure we took in transgressing God's commandments,
   will be of force to withdraw our assent from God's mercies: 1 Cor. xv.
   56, The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.'

   [5.] Faith in the promises, if it be not a conceit and a vain dream, is
   not only an act enforced by our necessity, but done in obedience to
   God's will; therefore we believe because God hath commanded it: 1 John
   iii. 23, And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the
   name of his Son Jesus Christ;' John vi. 29, This is the work of God,
   that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.' It sensibly appeareth many
   times, a poor soul hath no other motive or encouragement. It ventureth,
   notwithstanding all discouragements to the contrary, in the strength
   and sense of a command; as Peter, Luke v. 5, Master, we have toiled all
   the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless at thy word I will let
   down the net' Now that which is done, if rightly done, merely in
   obedience to a command, cannot be the ground of disobedience in other
   things. We must not pick and choose. Certainly if we believe the
   promises on God's command, we will make conscience of other things
   commanded also; for he is truly obedient to no precept that doth not
   obey all enforced by the same authority.

   3. The utility.

   [1.] That we may begin with God, to yield up our wills absolutely to
   his will; it is upon a belief that this is his will concerning us; for
   his will concerning our duty is revealed in his precepts: He hath
   showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
   thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
   God?' Micah vi. 8. Certainly an obedient creature desireth to know no
   more but what God will have him to do; and therefore it is needful we
   should believe what is God's will, that we may resolve upon his will:
   Rom. xii. 1, 2, I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
   God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
   unto God, which is your reasonable service; and be not conformed to
   this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye
   may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.'
   The first thing that we do in grace is to arm ourselves with a
   resolution to obey God's will, though it be never so contrary to our
   own, or to the wills of men, or the course of the world's fashions: 1
   Peter iv. 1, 2, Forasmuch, then, as Christ hath suffered for us in the
   flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
   suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should
   live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the
   will of God.' Now, that this resolution may be made knowingly and with
   the greater strength, not only with the strength of inclination or our
   own resolved, renewed will, but in the sense of God's authority, a
   strong belief is necessary that this course of life is pleasing to God.

   [2.] That we may hold on with God in an awe-ful, watchful, serious
   course of godliness, it is necessary that the belief of the
   commandments be deeply impressed upon us. Alas! otherwise we shall be
   off and on, forward and backward, according to the impulsion of our own
   inclinations and affections, and the sense of our interest in the
   world. Many of the commandments are crossing to our natural
   inclinations and corrupt humours, or contrary to our interests in the
   world, our profit, pleasure; and nothing will hold the heart to our
   duty but the conscience of God's authority: This is the Lord's will,
   then the gracious soul submitteth: 1 Thes. iv. 3, For this is the will
   of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from
   fornication;' and 1 Peter ii. 15, For so is the will of God, that with
   well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.' That is
   reason enough, and instead of all reasons, to a believer, to awe and
   charge his heart, that we may not shift and distinguish ourselves out
   of our duty, that we may shake off sloth and negligence, much more
   deceits, and fraudulency, and corrupt affections. Many shifts will be
   studied by a naughty heart that dispense with our credit, esteem,
   honour, preferment in the world for our loyalty to God. Nothing but a
   deep belief of the sovereignty of God and the sight of his will can be
   of sufficient power to the soul when such temptations arise, and our
   duties are so contrary to the inclinations of the flesh: Heb. xi. 8, By
   faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
   should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not
   knowing whither he went;' and ver. 17, 18, By faith Abraham, when he
   was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises
   offered up his only-begotten son; of whom it is was said, That in Isaac
   shall thy seed be called;' Gen. xii. 3, In thee shall all families of
   the earth be blessed.' Oh! how have believers need to bestir themselves
   upon such an occasion, and to remember no evil can be compared with
   God's wrath, no earthly good with his favour: that transitory delights
   are dearly bought if they endanger the soul to compass them: That the
   sufferings of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory
   that shall be revealed in us!' Rom. viii. 18. The ordinary experience
   of believers in lesser temptations is enough to evince this, &c.

   Use. 1. For reproof.

   1. That men do so little revive the belief of God's commandments, hence
   sins of omission: James iv. 17, Therefore to him that knoweth to do
   good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin;' of commission: Jer. viii. 6,
   I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright; no man repented him
   of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turned to his
   course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.' Would men venture to
   break a known law if they did consider that it was the command of God
   that hath power to save and to destroy? Surely want of faith in the
   precepts is a great cause of their coldness in duty, boldness in
   sinning: Prov. xiii. 13, Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed;
   but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.' Now any one
   would fear God's commandment if he did consider it in all its
   circumstances.

   2. Those that would strongly believe the promises, but weakly believe
   that part of the word that requireth their duty from them, all for
   privileges, seldom reflect upon their own qualification: it is a good
   temper when both go together: Ps. cxix. 166, I have hoped for thy
   salvation, and have done thy commandments;' so Ps. cxlvii. 11, The Lord
   taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his
   mercy.' But when asunder, all is naught. God's promises cannot comfort
   us if we be not of the number of them to whom they do belong; not only
   consider what God is, but what we are, and what is required of us--our
   qualification as well as his goodness, our duty as well as his mercy.

   Use 2. To believe the commandments with a lively faith. We should be
   tender of disobeying God's law. The law may be considered as a covenant
   of works, or as a rule of life. As a covenant of works, so it is
   satisfied by Christ for those that have an interest in him, and serveth
   to quicken us to get this interest in him. As it is a rule of life, so
   in the new covenant we give up ourselves to God to walk according to
   the tenor of it; as Israel by a voluntary submission: Exod. xix. 8, All
   that the Lord hath spoken, we will do.' So in the church of the New
   Testament we engage ourselves by a voluntary submission to walk
   according to the will of God, and confirm it by the sacraments,
   baptism, and the Lord's supper. Well, then, we are still to regard it
   as a binding rule, looking for grace to perform it. It is not only a
   rule given us for advice and direction, but for a strong obligation to
   urge and enforce us to our duty. So Ps. xl. 8, Thy law is in my heart;
   I delight to do thy will, O God.'

   Use 3. Do we believe the commandments? Then--

   1. We will not please ourselves with a naked trust in the promises,
   while we neglect our duty to God. That which God hath joined together
   no man must put asunder. The prophet saith, Hosea x. 11, Ephraim is an
   heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn;' compared with
   Deut. xxv. 4, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the
   corn.' We are addicted to our own ease, prize comforts, but loathe
   duty. Oh, make more conscience of obedience!

   2. Their faith will be lively and operative, cause to keep God's charge
   and observe his commandments; otherwise it is but an opinion and a dead
   faith: James ii. 20, Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without
   works is dead?' Many may discourse of the necessity of duty that have
   little sense of it; as the children in the furnace, the tire had no
   power over them, neither was one hair of their heads singed, nor their
   coats changed; not a lust mortified, no good by their strict notions.

   3. They must be obeyed as God's commands, abstaining from evil because
   God forbiddeth it, practising that which is good because God commandeth
   it Notitia voluntatis: 1 Thes. iv. 3, This is the will of God, even
   your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication;' 1 Thes.
   v. 8, 9, But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the
   breastplate of faith and love, and for an helmet, the hope of
   salvation: for God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
   salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ;' 1 Peter ii. 15, For so is the will
   of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of
   foolish men.' Certainly no private respect, desire of our own plea sure
   and profit, should hinder us; but we must respect one command as well
   as another, otherwise our obedience is partial. A quatenus ad omne
   valet consequentia; if we believe the commandments, we must believe
   all. Where a disposition is allowed to break any one of God's laws, the
   heart is not right. God's sovereignty, once acknowledged, is alike
   potent to restrain every inclination to acts displeasing to God and
   contrary to our duty, one as well as another.

   Secondly, The text may be considered relatively, with respect to the
   matter in hand; and so it may be conceived as a reason of asking, or as
   a reason of granting.

   1. As a reason of asking.

   [1.] It giveth a character of them that believe; they that believe
   God's commandments will desire to know them more, to be more accurate
   in knowing their duty, and the weight and consequence of it;--they are
   willing to practise all that it requireth, and so are willing to prove
   what is the acceptable will of the Lord:' Eph. v. 17, Wherefore be ye
   not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is;' they would
   not do anything doubtingly: Rom. iv. 23, He that doubteth is damned if
   he eat, because he eateth not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith
   is sin;' nor according to the wills of men: Gal. i. 10, For do I now
   persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased
   men, I should not be the servant of Christ.' They would avoid all
   appearance of evil: 1 Thes. v. 22, Occasions to evil; Rom. xiii. 14,
   Make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.' They
   know the weight and consequence of these things.

   [2.] It giveth us an intimation of the necessity of growth: none
   believe so much but they may believe more: 1 John v. 13, These things
   have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God,
   that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on
   the name of the Son of God:' and they may obey more, embrace the word
   more. David beggeth he may do so: always there is some new thing to be
   learned in the scripture.

   [3.] That faith planted in the heart is nourished and increased by more
   knowledge and understanding: 2 Peter i. 5, Add to your faith, virtue;
   to virtue, knowledge.' There is an implicit and an explicit faith;
   oportet discentem credere, swallowing pills, not chewing them.

   2. As a reason of granting. Believing God's commandments is a
   disposition that hath a promise of more knowledge to be communicated.

   [1.] God by one act of grace maketh way for another. First, he giveth
   this first favour of receiving the word by faith as divine, worthy to
   be believed and obeyed; then, to understand it and apprehend it more
   perfectly, discretion and judgment to go about duties wisely.

   [2.] God giveth according to the creatures' receptions; they that are
   dutiful and docile and willing to comply with their duty already known,
   shall know more.

   Use. The use is, if we expect more illumination, let us believe as much
   as is manifested already to us, with a mind to practise.

SERMON LXXVI.

   Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy
   word.--Ver. 67.

   IN this verse you may observe two things:--

   1. The evil of prosperity, before I was afflicted I went astray.

   2. The good of adversity, but now have I kept thy word. Before
   wandering, but now attentive to his duty. Or, if you will, here is the
   necessity of afflictions and the utility of them.

   1. The necessity, Before I was afflicted I went astray.' Some think
   that David in his own person representeth the wantonness and
   stubbornness of all mankind. If it should be so, yet the person in whom
   the instance is given is notable. If this was the disposition of the
   prophet and man of God, and he needed this discipline, we much more: if
   he could say it in truth of heart that he was made worse by his
   prosperity, we need always to be jealous of ourselves; and were it not
   for the scourge, we should forget our duty and the obedience we owe to
   God.

   2. The utility and benefit of afflictions, But now have I kept thy
   word.' Keeping the law is a general word. The use of God's rod is to
   bring us home unto God, and the affliction driveth us to make better
   use of his word: it changeth us from vanity to seriousness, from error
   to truth, from stubbornness to teachfulness, from pride to modesty. It
   is commonly said, pathe'mata mathe'mata; and the apostle telleth us
   that Jesus Christ himself learned obedience by the things which he
   suffered, Heb. v. 8; and here David was the better for the cross; so
   should we. Or rather, you may in the words observe three things:--

   1. A confession of his wandering, I went astray.'

   2. The course God took to reduce him to his duty, I was afflicted.'

   3. The success or effect of that course, I have kept thy word.'

   Theodoret expresseth this in three words, erro'stesa, etme'then,
   erro'sthenI was sick; I was cut, or let blood; I was well, or recovered
   my health again.

   1. The one giveth us the cause of afflictions; they are for sin, I went
   astray:' wherein there is a secret acknowledgment of his guilt, that
   his sin was the cause of the chastisement God brought upon him.

   2. The true notion and nature of affliction to the people of God. The
   cross changeth its nature, and is not poena, a destructive punishment,
   but remedium delinquentium, a medicinal dispensation, and a means of
   our cure.

   3. The end of them is obedience, or keeping God's word. The sum of the
   whole is, I was out of the way, but thy rod hath reduced me, and
   brought me into it again. Aben Ezra conceiveth that in this last clause
   he intimateth a desire of deliverance, because the rod had done its
   work; rather, I think he expresseth his frame and temper when he was
   delivered; and accordingly I shall make use of it by and by.

   I might observe many points, but the doctrine from the whole verse is--

   Doct. That the end of God's afflicting, is to reduce his afflicted and
   straying people into the right way.

   I shall explain the point by these considerations.

   1. That man is of a straying nature, apt to turn out of the way that
   leadeth to God and to true happiness. We are all so by nature: Isa.
   liii. 6, All we like sheep have gone astray.' Sheep, of all creatures,
   are exceeding subject to stray, if not tended and kept in the better,
   unable to keep out of error, and having erred, unable to return. This
   is the emblem by which the Holy Ghost would set forth the nature of
   mankind. But is it better with us after grace received? No; we are in
   part so still. The best of us, if left to ourselves, how soon are we
   out of the right way? into what sad errors do we run ourselves? Ps.
   xix. 12, Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
   sins.' Since grace, we all have our deviations; though our hearts be
   set to walk with God for the main, yet ever and anon we are swerving
   from our rule, transgressing our bounds, and neglecting our duty. Good
   David had cause to say, Ps. cxix. 176, I have gone astray like a lost
   sheep: oh, seek thy servant!' We go astray not only out of ignorance,
   but out of perverseness of inclination: Jer. xiv. 10, Thus have they
   loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet.' We have hearts
   that love to wander; we love shift and change, though it be for the
   worse; and so will be making excursions into the ways of sin.

   2. This straying humour is much increased and encouraged by prosperity,
   which, though it be good in itself, yet, so perverse are we by nature,
   that we are the worse for it. That the wicked are the worse for it, is
   clear: Isa. xxvi. 10, Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will they
   not learn righteousness.' The sunshine upon the dung hill will produce
   nothing but stinks, and the salt sea will turn all that falleth into it
   into salt water; the sweet dews of heaven, and the tribute of the
   rivers all becometh salt when it falleth into the sea. So wicked men
   convert all into their humour: neither God's mercies nor judgments will
   have any gracious and kindly work upon them: but, if it be well with
   them, they take the more liberty to live loosely and profanely: the
   fear of God, which is the great holdback from all wickedness, is
   lessened and quite lost in them when they see no change: Ps. lv. 19,
   Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.' That little
   slavish fear which they have, which should keep them back from
   wandering, is then lost, and the more gently God dealeth with them, the
   more godless and secure they are. When they go on prosperously and
   undisturbedly, the more obdurate ever. But is it not so with the people
   of God also? Yes, verily. David, whose heart smote him when he cut off
   the lap of Saul's garment when he was wandering in the wilderness,
   could plot the death of Uriah, his faithful servant, when he was at
   ease in his palace. We lose much tenderness of conscience, watchfulness
   against sin, much of that lively diligence that we should otherwise
   show forth in carrying on the spiritual life, when we are at ease, and
   all things go well with us. We are apt to indulge the flesh when we
   have so many baits to feed it; and to learn how to abound is the harder
   lesson of the two than to learn how to be abased, Phil. iv. 12; and
   therefore, did not God correct us, we should grow careless and
   negligent. The beginning of all obedience is the mortification of the
   flesh, which naturally we cannot endure. After we have submitted and
   subjected ourselves to God, the flesh will be seeking its prey, and be
   rebelling and waxing wanton against the spirit, till God snatch its
   allurements from us. Therefore the Lord by divers afflictions is fain
   to break us and bring us into order. We force him to humble us by
   poverty, or disgrace, or diseases, or by domestic crosses, or some
   inconveniency of the natural and animal life, which we value too much.
   Besides, our affections to heavenly things languish when all things
   succeed with us in this world according to our heart's desire; and this
   coldness and remissness is not easily shaken off. Many are like the
   children of Reuben and Gad, Num. xxxii., who, when they found
   convenient pastures on this side Jordan, were content with it for their
   portion, without seeking aught in the land of promise. So their desires
   insensibly settle here, and have less respect to the good of the world
   to come.

   3. When it is thus with us, God seeth fit to send afflictions. Much of
   the wisdom of God's providence is to be observed;--partly in the season
   of affliction, in what state and posture of soul it surpriseth us, when
   we are wandering, when we most need it, when our abuse of prosperity
   calleth aloud for it; when the sheep wander, the dog is let loose to
   fetch them in again. God suiteth his providence to our necessities: 1
   Peter i. 6, For a season ye are in heaviness, if need be.' Alas! we
   often see that afflictions are highly necessary and seasonable, either
   to prevent a distemper that is growing upon us, or to reclaim us from
   some evil course in which we have wandered from God. Paul was in danger
   to be lifted up, and then God sendeth a thorn in the flesh. This
   discipline is very proper and necessary before the disease run on too
   far. Partly in the kind of affliction. All physic doth not work upon
   the same humour; divers lusts must have divers remedies. Pride, envy,
   covetousness, wantonness, emulation, have all their proper cures. All
   sins are referred to three impure fountains: 1 John ii. 16, For all
   that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
   the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.' From the
   lusts of the flesh do arise not only the gross acts of wantonness,
   fornication, adultery, gluttony, drunkenness, which the more brutish
   and base part of mankind are taken with, but an inordinate love of
   pleasures, vain company, and vain delights, carnal complacency, or
   flesh-pleasing, wherewith the refined part of the world are too often
   captivated and bewitched. The lust of the eyes, covetousness and
   worldly-mindedness, produce wretchedness, rapines, contentions, strife,
   or that immoderate desire of having or joining house to house, field to
   field, and building up ourselves one storey higher in the world. From
   pride of life cometh ambition, lofty conceit of ourselves, scorn and
   contempt of others, affectation of credit and repute in the world, pomp
   of having multitudes of servants, or greatness of train, fineness of
   apparel, and innumerable vanities! Now God, that he may meet with his
   servants when they are tripping in any kind, he sendeth out afflictions
   as his faithful messengers to stop them in their career, that the flesh
   may not sail and carry it away with a full and clear gale. Against the
   lusts of the flesh he sendeth sicknesses and diseases; against the
   lusts of the eyes, poverty and disappointments in our relations;
   against pride, disgraces and shame: and sometimes he varieth the
   dispensation, for his providence doth keep one tenor, and every cure
   will not fit every humour; all will not work alike upon all. He sendeth
   that affliction which is sure to work; he knoweth how to strike in the
   right vein: thus he cureth Paul's pride by a troublesome disease. None
   that study providence but may observe the wisdom of God in the kind of
   affliction, and how suitable it is to the work it is to do; for God
   doth all things in number, weight, and measure. Partly by the manner
   how it cometh upon us, by what instruments, and in what sort. How many
   make themselves miserable by an imagined cross! and so, when all things
   without are well, their own humours and passions make them a burden to
   themselves, and when they are not wounded in point of honour, nor
   lessened and cut short in estate, nor assaulted in their health, nor
   their relations diminished and cut off, but are hedged round about with
   all temporal happiness, there seemeth to be no room or place for any
   affliction or trouble in their bosoms, yet, in the fulness of their
   sufficiency, God maketh them a terror and burden to themselves, either
   by their own fears or misconceit, or the false imagination of some loss
   or disgrace: God maketh them uncomfortable and full of disquiet; and
   though they want nothing, yet they are not at ease, yea, more troubled
   than those that are called out to conflict with real, yea, the greatest
   evils. Haman is an instance: he was one of the princes of the kingdom
   of Persia, flowing in wealth and all manner of delights, in degree of
   dignity and honour next the king himself, and flourishing in the hope
   of a numerous and fair issue; yet because Mordecai, a poor Jew, did not
   do him expected reverence, All this availeth me nothing,' Esther v. 19.
   So soon can God send a worm into the fairest gourd, and a
   dissatisfaction into the most flourishing estate in the world, that men
   shall have no rest night and day, especially if a spark of his wrath
   light into the conscience: Ps. xxxix. 11, When thou with rebukes dost
   correct man for his iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away
   like a moth: surely every man is vanity, Selah.' There is a secret moth
   that eateth up all their contentment; they are under terror,
   discouragement, and want of peace: God teacheth them that nothing can
   be satisfactorily enjoyed apart from his blessed self: A fire not blown
   shall consume them,' Job xx. 26. Partly in the continuance of
   afflictions. God ordereth, taketh off, and layeth on afflictions at his
   own pleasure, and as he seeth it conducible to our profit. Variety of
   afflictions may meet together on the best and dearest of God's
   children, there being in the best many corruptions both to be
   discovered and subdued, and many graces to be tried: 1 Peter i. 6,
   Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are
   in heaviness, through manifold temptations;' and James i. 2, My
   brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.' One
   trouble worketh into the hands of another, and the succession of them
   is as necessary as the first stroke. We often force God to renew his
   corrections, ab assuetis nulla fit passio--things to which we are
   accustomed do not affect us; therefore, under a general affliction
   there come in many special ones to rub up our sense, and make it work
   the better. Under public calamities we have a private one, and they
   come one in the neck of another like waves. When God hath begun he will
   make an end, and bring his discipline to some more comfortable and
   perfect issue. In all these things the wisdom of God is to be observed.

   4. The affliction so sent hath a notable use to reduce us to a sense
   and care of our duty. This is often pressed in the scripture: The fruit
   of all shall be to take away their sin.' Afflictions are compared in
   scripture to fire that purgeth away our dross: 1 Peter i. 7, Now for a
   season, if need be, ye are in manifold temptations, that the trial of
   your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
   though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour,
   and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.' To the fan that driveth
   away the chaff: Mark iii. 12, Whose fan is in his hand, and he will
   throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he
   will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.' To a pruning-hook, that
   cutteth off the luxuriant branches, and maketh the others that remain
   the more fruitful: John xv. 2, Every branch in me that beareth not
   fruit he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it
   that it may bring forth more fruit.' To physic, that purgeth away the
   sick matter: Isa. xxvii. 9, By this therefore shall the iniquity of
   Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin.' To
   ploughing and harrowing of the ground, that destroyeth the ill weeds,
   and fitteth it to receive the good seed: Jer. iv. 3, Break up your
   fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.' To the file that worketh oft'
   our rust, and the flail that maketh our husk fly off. So Heb. xii. 11,
   No affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous;
   nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   to them that are exercised therewith.' The affliction hath a necessary
   tendency to so comfortable an effect But because generals do but beat
   the air, and do not so well fit themselves in the mind, I shall show
   you it is either the means of our first conversion, or subservient to
   the reformation of those that are converted.

   [1.] It is a means of our first conversion. How many begin with God
   upon the occasion of afflictions! The time of sorrows is a time of
   loves. The hot furnace is Christ's workhouse, where he formeth the most
   excellent vessels of honour and praise for his own use. Manasseh, Paul,
   and the jailer in the Acts, were all chosen in the fire; as the Lord
   saith, Isa. xlviii. 10, I have chosen thee in the furnace of
   affliction,' where God began to discover his choice by his working on
   their affections. All men are vessels capable of any form, therefore
   God puts them into the furnace. Most of us are taken in our month, as
   the ram that Abraham offered was caught in the thickets. When stout and
   stubborn sinners are broken with want and distress, then they come to
   themselves, and think of returning to their Father: Luke xv. 17, 18,
   And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my
   father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I
   will arise and go to my father,' &c. Afflictions make us more serious;
   conscience is then apt to work. Before, we were guided by the wisdom of
   the flesh, and governed by our carnal appetite, never minded heavenly
   things, till God get us under, and then we bethink ourselves. Have you
   never known any instance in this kind? that whilst they were young,
   rich, strong, noble, all their humour was for vain pleasure, to-day
   hunting, to morrow hawking, another day feasting, and then brawling,
   fighting, drinking, carousing, dancing; all the warnings of parents,
   the good counsel of tutors and governors, the grave exhortations of
   ministers and preachers, will do no good upon them; they are always
   wandering up and down from God and from themselves, cannot endure a
   thought of God, of death, of heaven, of hell, of judgment to come; but
   when God casts them once into some grievous disease, or some great
   trouble, they begin to come to themselves, and then they that would
   hear nothing, understand nothing, despised all grave and gracious
   counsel given, as if it did not belong to them, scoffed at admonitions,
   thought the day lost in which they had not acted some sin or other,
   when the cross preacheth, and some grievous calamity is upon them, then
   conscience beginneth to work, and this bringeth to remembrance all that
   they have heard before, then they come to themselves, and would fain if
   they could come to Christ. Sharp affliction is a sound, powerful,
   rousing teacher: Job xxxvi. 8, 9, And if they be bound in fetters, and
   be holden in cords of affliction, then he showeth them their work, and
   their transgressions that they have exceeded.' Grace worketh in a
   powerful but yet in a moral way, congruously but forcibly, and by a fit
   accommodation of circumstances. One place more: Jer. xxxi. 18, Truly I
   have heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and
   I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me,
   and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.' Affliction
   awakeneth serious reflections upon our ways; therefore take heed what
   ye do with the convictions that arise upon afflictions; to slight them
   is dangerous. Nothing breedeth hardness of heart so much as the
   smothering of convictions. Iron often heated grows the harder. On the
   other side, see they do not degenerate into despair, either the raging
   despair which terrifieth, or the sottish despair which stupefieth: Jer.
   xviii. 12, They said, There is no hope, but we will walk after our own
   devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.'
   The middle between both is a holy sensibleness of our condition, which
   is a good preparation for the great duties of the gospel. The work of
   conversion is at first difficult and troublesome, but pass over this
   brunt, and all things will be sweet and easy: the bullock at first
   yoking is most unruly, and fire at the first kindling casts forth most
   smoke; so when sin is revived it brings forth death: Rom. vii. 9, For I
   was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin
   revived, and I died.' But yet cherish the work till God speak peace
   upon sound terms.

   [2.] It is a great help to those that are converted already. How many
   are reduced to a more serious, lively practice of godliness by their
   troubles! We are rash, inconsiderate, inattentive to our duty, but the
   rod maketh us cautious and diligent. We follow the world, not the word
   of God; the vanities thereof take us off from minding the promises or
   precepts of the word, till the affliction cometh. In short, there are
   none of us so tamed and subdued to God but that we need to be tamed
   more. We are all for carnal liberty; there is a wantonness in us. We
   are high-minded, earthly-minded, till God come with his scourge to
   reclaim us. He chasteneth us for our profit, that we may be partakers
   of his holiness, Heb. xii. 10; some lust still needeth mortifying, or
   some grace needeth exercising; our pride needs to be mortified, or our
   affections to be weaned from the world. The almond-tree is made more
   fruitful by driving nails into it, because that letteth out a noxious
   gum that hindereth its fruitfulness; so when God would have you thrive
   more, he makes you feel the sharpness of affliction. You have heard
   Plutarch's story of Jason of Chaerea, that had his imposthume let out
   by a casual wound. There is some corruption God would let out. We are
   apt to set up our rest here, and therefore we need to be disturbed, to
   have the world crucified to us, Gal. vi. 14, that the cumber of the
   world may drive us to seek for rest where it is only to be found, and
   to humble us by outward defects, that we may look after inward
   abundance, that, by being poor in this world, we may be rich in faith,
   James ii. 5, and having nothing in, the creature, we may possess all
   things in God, 2 Cor. vi. 10, and be enlarged inwardly as we are
   straitened outwardly; in short, that we may be oftener with God. God
   sent a tempest after Jonah. Absalom set Joab's barley-field on fire,
   and then he came to him, 2 Sam. xiv. 30. Isa. xxvi. 16, Lord, in
   trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy
   chastening was upon them;' Hosea v. 15, In their affliction they will
   seek me early.' It were endless to run out in discourses of this
   nature.

   5. The affliction of itself doth not work thus, but as sanctified and
   accompanied with the Spirit of God. If the affliction of itself and by
   itself would do it, it would do so always, but that we see by
   experience it doth not. In itself it is an evil and a pain that is the
   consequent and the fruit of sin, and so breedeth impatience, despair,
   murmuring, and blasphemy against God. As it is a legal curse, other
   fruit cannot be expected of it but reviving terrors of heart and
   repinings against the sovereignty of God. We see often the same
   affliction that maketh one humble, maketh another raging; the same
   poverty that maketh one full of dependence upon God, maketh another
   full of shifts and evil courses whereby to supply his want. No; it is
   understood of sanctified crosses, when grace goeth along with them to
   bless them to us: Jer. xxxi. 19, Surely after that I was turned, I
   repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was
   ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my
   youth;' after God had wrought a gracious change in him by his
   afflicting hand and Spirit working together. So Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed
   is he whom thou chastenest, and instructest out of thy law.' The rod
   must be expounded by the word, and both must be effectually applied by
   the Spirit. Grace is God's immediate creature and production; he useth
   subservient means and helps, sometimes the word, sometimes the rod,
   sometimes both; but neither doth anything without his Spirit.

   6. This benefit, though gotten by sharp afflictions, should be owned,
   and thankfully acknowledged as a great testimony and expression of
   God's love to us. So doth David to the praise of God. It is a branch
   that belongeth to the thanksgiving mentioned ver. 65, Thou hast done
   well with thy servant, according to thy word:'--the first of this
   octonary. We are prejudiced against the cross out of a self-love, a
   mistaken self-love; we love ourselves more than we love God, and the
   ease of the body more than the welfare of the soul, and the world more
   than heaven, and our temporal pleasure and contentment more than our
   spiritual and eternal benefit; and therefore we cannot endure to hear
   of the cross, much more to bear it. Oh! this doth not become men;
   surely it doth not become Christians! Would you have your consolation
   here? Luke xvi.; your portion here? Ps. vii. Would you value yourselves
   by the flourishing of the outward man, or the renewing of the inward
   man? 2 Cor. iv. 16. Should we be so impatient of the cross? Afflictions
   are bitter to present sense, but yet they are healthful to the soul:
   they are not so bitter in present feeling as they will be sweet in the
   after-fruits. Now, we are greatly unthankful to God, if the bitterness
   be not lessened and tempered by this fruit and profit. Consider, when
   are we most miserable? When we go astray, or when we are reduced into
   the right way? when we are engaged in a rebellion against God, or when
   brought into a sense of our duty? Hosea iv. 17, Ephraim is joined to
   idols: let him alone.' Let him alone is the heaviest judgment that can
   be laid upon a poor creature. Providence, conscience, ministry let him
   alone; the case is desperate, and we are incorrigible when we are left
   to our own ways. There needeth no more to make our case miserable and
   sad than to be suffered to go on in sin without let and restraint;
   there is no hope of such: God seemeth to cast them off, and to desert
   and leave them to their own lusts. It is evident he mindeth not their
   salvation, but leaveth them to the world, to be condemned with the
   world. Well, then, doth God do the elect any harm when he casts them
   into great troubles? If we use violence to a man that is ready to be
   drowned, and, in pulling him out of the waters, should break an arm or
   a leg, would he not be thankful? Yes, saith he, I can dispense with
   that, for you have saved my life. So may God's children bless his name.
   O blessed providence! I had been a witless fool, and gone on in a
   course of sin, if God had not awakened me. A philosopher could say that
   he never made better voyage than when he suffered shipwreck, because
   then he began to apply himself to the study of wisdom: surely a
   Christian should say, Blessed be God that he laid his chastenings upon
   me, and brought me to a serious heavenly mind: I should otherwise have
   been a carnal fool, as others are. Wicked men are left to their own
   swing. When the case of the sick is desperate, physicians let them
   alone, give them leave to take anything they have a mind unto. The
   apostle speaketh much to this purpose: Heb. xii. 6, Whom the Lord
   loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.' Sharp
   afflictions, which in their visible appearance seem tokens of God's
   hatred, are rather tokens of his love. There is a twofold love of
   God--Amor benevolentiae et complacentiae--the love of good-will,
   whereby the Lord out of the purposes of his own free grace doth
   regenerate us, and adopt us into his family; and having loved us, and
   made us amiable, he doth then delight in us. The text alleged may be
   expounded of either. Oh! then, why do not we more own God in our
   afflictions? If he use us a little hardly, it is not an argument of his
   hatred, but his love. Thou darest not pray, Lord, let me have my
   worldly comforts, though they damn me; let me not be afflicted, though
   it will do me good. And if thou darest not pray so, will you repine
   when God seeth this course necessary for us, and taketh away the fuel
   of our lusts? Is it not a good exchange to part with outward comforts
   for inward holiness? If he take away our quiet, and give us peace of
   conscience, our worldly goods, and give us true riches, have we cause
   to complain? If outward wants be recompensed with an abundance of
   inward grace, if we have less of the world that we may have more of
   God, a healthy soul in a sickly body, it is just matter of
   thanksgiving: 3 John 2, I wish, above all things, that thou mayest
   prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.' We can
   subscribe to this in the general; all will affirm that afflictions are
   profitable, and that it is a good thing to be patient and submissive
   under them; but when any cross cometh to knock at our door, we are
   loath to give it entrance; and if it thrust in upon us, we fret and
   fume, and our souls sit uneasy, and all because we are addicted so
   unreason ably to the ease of the flesh, the quiet, happiness, and
   welfare of the carnal life, and have so little regard to life
   spiritual.

   7. At the first coming of the affliction we do not see this benefit so
   well as in the review of the whole dispensation: Before I was afflicted
   I went astray; but now I have kept thy word.' So Heb. xii. 11, Now no
   chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous;
   nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   to them which are exercised thereby.' There is a perfect opposition;
   the root and the fruit are opposed--affliction and fruit of
   righteousness, the quality of the root, and the quality of the fruit:
   ou? charas einai alla` lu'pes, karpo`n eireniko`n, the appearance and
   the reality, dokei and apodi'dosis. Then the season, pro`s to` paro`n
   and u'steron. God's physic must have time to work. At first it may not
   be so, or at least not appear; for things are before they appear or can
   be observed for the present. We must tarry God's leisure, and be
   content with his blows, till we feel the benefit of them: it is first
   matter of faith, and then of feeling; though we do not presently
   understand why everything is done, we must wait. The hand on the dial
   doth not seem to stir, yet it keeps its course; while it is paving we
   see it not, but that it hath passed from one hour to another is
   evident. So is God's work with the soul; and spiritual renovation and
   increase is not so sensible at the first though it be carried on eme'ra
   kai` eme'ra, day by day, 2 Cor. iv. 16, but in view of the whole it
   will ap pear. What are we the better? Doth sin decay? and what sin? Do
   we find it otherwise with us than it was before?

   8. This profit is not only when the affliction is upon us, but after it
   is over the fruit of it must remain. Their qualms and pangs most have:
   Ps. lxxviii. 34-37, When he slew them, then they sought him, and
   returned and inquired early after God: and they remembered that God was
   their rock, and the high God their redeemer. Nevertheless, they did
   flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their
   tongues; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they
   steadfast in his covenant.' Many have a little forced religion in their
   extremities, but it weareth off with their trouble. Sin is but
   suspended for a while, and the devil chained up; they are very good
   under the rod, they are frighted to it; but after the deliverance
   cometh, the more profane. It is true many may begin with God in their
   troubles, and their necessities drive them to the throne of grace; and
   Christ had never heard of many, if -fevers and palsies, and possessions
   and blindness, deafness and dumbness, had not brought them unto him,
   thanks to the disease. But if a course of godliness begins upon these
   occasions, and continues afterwards, God will accept it; he is willing
   to receive us upon any terms. Men will say, You come to me in your
   extremity; but he doth not upbraid us, provided we will come so as to
   abide with him, and will not turn the back upon him when our turn is
   served. If you do so, take heed; God hath other judgments to reach you:
   as John said, Mat. iii. 11, 12, He that cometh after me is mightier
   than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with
   the Holy Ghost and with fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will
   throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner, but he
   will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.' So that which cometh
   after is mightier than that which went before; the last judgment is the
   heaviest: The axe is laid to the root of the tree; therefore every tree
   that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the
   fire,' Mat. iii. 10. He will not only lop off the branches, but strike
   at the root; as the Sodomites that escaped the sword of Chedorlaomer
   perished by fire from heaven. The Israelites that were not drowned in
   the Red Sea, were stung to death by fiery serpents: As if a man did
   flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned
   his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him,' Amos v. 19. When you
   avoid one judgment, you may meet an other, and find a stroke where you
   think yourselves most secure.

   Use 1. Let us consider these things, that we may profit by all the
   chastenings of the Lord. It is now a time of affliction, both as to
   public judgments and as to the private condition of many of the people
   of God. We have been long straying from God, from our duty, from one
   another; it was high time for the Lord to take his rod in his hand, and
   to scourge us home again. Upon these three nations there is somewhat of
   God's three great judgments--war, pestilence, and famine; they are all
   dreadful. The pestilence is such a judgment as turneth populous cities
   into deserts and solitudes in a short time; then one cannot help
   another: riches and honours profit nothing then, and friends and
   kinsfolks stand afar off: many die without any spiritual helps. In war,
   what destructions and slaughters, expense of blood and treasure! In
   famine, you feel yourselves to die without a disease, know not where to
   have fuel to allay and feed the fire which nature hath kindled in your
   bodies. But, blessed be God, all these are in moderation. Pestilence
   doth not ragingly spread, the war is at a distance, the famine only a
   scarcity. Before God stirreth up all his wrath, he observeth what we do
   with these beginnings. Besides, the people of God are involved in a
   heap of miseries on all hands; the op pressed, dejected party burdened
   with jealousies, and ready to be haled to prison and put under
   restraint. Holy men sometimes have personal afflictions added to the
   public calamities. Jeremiah was cast into the dungeon when the city was
   besieged. The chaff and grain both are threshed together, but the grain
   is, besides, ground in the mill and baked in the oven. Besides, who
   thinks of his strayings, and returning with a more serious resolution
   to his duty? If we would profit by afflictions we must avoid both the
   faulty extremes: Heb. xii. 5, My son, despise not thou the chastening
   of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.' Slighting and
   fainting must be avoided.

   1. Let us not slight them. When we bear them with a stupid senseless
   mind, surely that hindereth all profit. None can endure to have their
   anger despised, no more than their love: a father is displeased when
   his child slights his correction. That we may not slight it, let us
   consider:--

   [1.] Their author, God. We think them fortuitous, from chance, but they
   do not rise out of the dust,' Job v. 6. Whoever be the instruments, or
   whatever be the means, the wise God hath the whole ordering of it. He
   is the first cause; he is to be sought to, he is to be appeased, if we
   would stop evil at the fountain-head; for all creatures willingly or
   unwillingly obey him, and are subject to his empire and government:
   Amos iii. 6, Is there any evil in the city, and I have not done it,
   saith the Lord?' Isa. xlv. 7, I form the light, and create darkness; I
   make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all these things;' Job i. 21,
   The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.'

   [2.] The meritorious cause is sin: Lam. iii. 39, Wherefore doth a
   living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sin?' That first
   brought mischief into the world, and still continueth it. God never
   afflicts without a cause; either we need it, or we deserve it: Micah
   vii. 9, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
   against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he
   will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his
   righteousness.' We should search for the particular sins that provoke
   God to afflict us; for while we only speak of sin in general, we do but
   inveigh against a notion, and personate mourning; but those we can
   charge upon our selves are most proper and powerful to break the heart.

   [3.] The end is our repentance and amendment, to correct sin past, or
   prevent sin to come.

   (1.) For correction, to make us more penitent for sin past. We being in
   a lower sphere of understanding, know things better by their effects
   than their nature: Jer. ii. 19, Thine own wickedness shall correct
   thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know, therefore, and see
   that it is an evil and bitter thing that thou hast forsaken the Lord
   thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord of hosts.'
   Moral evil is represented to us by natural evil; pain showeth what sin
   is.

   (2.) For prevention of sin for time to come. The smart should make us
   cautious and watchful against sin: Josh. xxii. 17, 18, Is the iniquity
   of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed to this day,
   although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord, but that
   ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? And it will be,
   seeing ye rebel to-day against the Lord, that to-morrow he will be
   wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.' Afflictions also should
   stir up in us heavenly thoughts, heavenly desires, and more lively
   diligence in the exercise of those graces which before lay dormant in
   us through our neglect. Only I must tell you, that sometimes the
   affliction may be merely for prevention, and may go before sin. God
   hath always a cause, but he doth not always suppose a fault in act, but
   sometimes in possibility; looking into thy actions or thy tem per, what
   thou hast done, or wouldst do, to cure or prevent a distemper in thy
   spirit, as well as a disorder in thy conversation.

   2. Let us not faint. When the afflictions sit close and near, then we
   are apt to fall into the other extreme, to be dejected out of measure.
   An over- sense worketh on our anger, and then it is fretting; or on our
   sorrow, and then it is fainting. The former is the worse of the two,
   for that is to set up an anti-providence, or a being displeased with
   God's government, a practical disowning of his greatness and justice.
   All men will acknowledge God is great, yet what worm is there will
   submit to him any further than themselves please? We say we deserve
   nothing but evil from his hands, but yet are maddened like wild bulls
   in a net when the goad is in our sides. We say, Any other cross but
   this. We do not dislike trial, but this trial that is upon us. God
   thought this fittest for us; our murmuring will not ease our trouble,
   but increase and continue it. Certainly without submission troubles
   will do us no good: Patience worketh experience,' Rom. v. 4. Fainting,
   properly so taken, is when we look upon God's work through a false
   glass, and mis-expound his dispensation. God puts forth his hand, not
   to thrust us off, but pull us to himself: Hosea v. 15, I will go and
   return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my
   face: in their affliction they will seek me early.' The very affliction
   giveth us hope that he will not let us go on securely in our sins. It
   is not our being afflicted and made miserable by trouble which God
   aimeth at: Lam. iii. 33, He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the
   children of men.' Nor is it that which we should chiefly be affected
   with under affliction. We should mind another lesson taught by it,
   which if we neglect, our sense of trouble will be but perplexing. It is
   to subdue sin, to make us more mindful of heavenly things, to have our
   hearts humbled. No affliction should be counted intolerable which
   helpeth to purge our sin. We evidence our love to sin if we are
   overmuch troubled at it, or peevishly quarrel with God. Fainting
   showeth our weakness: Prov. xxiv. 10, If thou faint in the day of
   adversity, thy strength is small.'

   Use 2. Something concerning the profit of it: value it, observe it.

   1. Value it. What do you count a profit or benefit, to flow in wealth,
   or excel in grace; to live in ease, or to be kept in a holy, heavenly,
   and humble frame? Heb. xii. 10, For they verily for a few days
   chastened us after their own pleasure, but he for our profit, that we
   might be partakers of his holiness.' Not that we might have the pelf of
   this world, but that we might be partakers of his holiness. It is
   better to have holiness than to have health, wealth, and honour; the
   sanctification of an affliction is better than to have deliverance out
   of it. Deliverance taketh away malum naturale--some penal evil which
   God bringeth upon us; sanctification, malum morale--the greatest evil,
   which is sin. I am sure this is that which we should look after.
   Deliverance is God's work, the improvement of the trouble is our duty:
   do you mind your work, and God will not be wanting to do his part.

   2. Observe it, and see how the rod worketh, what thoughts it begets in
   you, what resolutions it stirreth up, what solaces you run to, and seek
   after to this end.

   [1.] In what temper and frame of heart you were when the affliction
   surprised you. Usually affliction treadeth upon the heels of some sin.
   If it be open, and in our practice, it discovereth itself; if secret,
   and in the frame of our hearts, it must be searched after. Usually it
   is some slightness and carelessness of spiritual and heavenly things;
   your hearts were grown in love with the world, you began to neglect
   your souls, grew more cold in the love of God, more formal in prayer,
   and indifferent as to your spiritual estate; you did not watch over
   your hearts; therefore the holy and jealous God cometh and awakeneth
   you by his smarting scourge. The foregoing distemper observed, will
   help you to state your profit.

   [2.] How that is cured by God's discipline, or what benefit you have
   gotten by it? You are more diligent in your duty, careful in your
   preparations for a better state. A Christian should be able to give an
   account of the methods by which God bringeth him to heaven. David could
   give an account, as here, Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now
   have I kept thy word;' and ver. 71, It is good for me that I have been
   afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes;' not good that I should be,
   as accepting the punishment, but that I have been, as owning the
   profit.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXXVII.

   Thou art good, and doest good: teach me thy statutes.--Ver. 68.

   THE Psalmist in the first verse of this portion had expressed himself
   in a way of thankfulness to God for his goodness, ver. 65; then
   interrupteth his thanksgiving a little, and beggeth the continuance of
   the same goodness, ver. 66; and after that returneth again to show how
   this good came by means of affliction, ver. 67; and therefore once more
   praiseth God for his goodness, and reneweth his suit. God is ever good
   to his people, but most sensibly they have proof of it in their
   afflictions, when to appearance he seemeth to deal hardly with them;
   yet all that while he doth them good. Sanctification of afflictions is
   a greater mercy than deliverance out of them. We may learn our duty by
   the discipline of a smart rod: Thou dealest well with thy servant;'
   for, Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now I have kept thy
   word.' And then he falleth into thanksgiving and prayer again, Thou art
   good, and doest good: teach me thy statutes.' Here is--

   1. A compilation and confession of God's goodness, both in his nature
   and actions.

   2. A petition for grace, teach me thy statutes.

   First, The compellation used to God, Thou art good, and doest good.'
   Divers have been the glosses of interpreters upon these words. Aben
   Ezra, Bonus es non petenti, et benefacis petenti--thou art good to them
   that ask not, but surely dost good to them that ask. Others, thou art
   good in this world, dost good in the world to come. Others better, God
   is good of himself and doeth good to us. Goodness is communicative of
   itself; he is good, that noteth his nature and inclination; and he
   doeth good, that noteth his work, whereby he giveth proof of his
   goodness. Unumquodque operatur secundum suam formam--every thing acteth
   according to its nature. So doth God; as is his being, so is his
   operation; he is good, and doeth good; the work must needs be
   answerable to the workman. The point is:--

   Doct. It becometh all those that have to do with God to have a deep
   sense of his goodness.

   1. What is God's goodness.

   2. How it is manifested to us.

   3. Why those that come to God should have a deep sense of it. First,
   What is God's goodness? There is a threefold goodness ascribed by
   divines to God:--

   1. His natural goodness, which is the natural perfection of his being.

   2. His moral goodness, which is the moral perfection of his being.

   3. His beneficial communicative goodness, called otherwise his
   benignity, which is of chief regard in this place. Besides the
   perfection and excellency of his nature, there is his will and
   self-propension to diffuse his benefits; the perfection of his nature
   is his natural and moral goodness, the other his bounty. All must be
   spoken to distinctly.

   1. God is naturally good. There is such an absolute perfection in, his
   nature and being, that nothing is wanting to it or defective in it, and
   nothing can be added to it to make it better. As Philo saith, Ho o`ntos
   o` to` proton agatho`n--the first being must needs be the first good.
   As soon as we conceive there is a God, we presently conceive that he is
   good. In this sense it is said, Mark x. 18, Why callest thou me good?
   there is none good but one, and that is God.' He is good of himself,
   good in himself, yea, good itself. There is none good above him, or
   besides him, or beyond him; it is all from him and in him, if it be
   good. He is primitively and originally good, auta'gathos, good of
   himself, which nothing .else is; for all creatures are good only by
   participation and communication from God. He is essentially good; not
   only good, but goodness itself: the creature's good is a superadded
   quality; in him it is his essence. He is infinitely good; the
   creature's goodness is but a drop, but in God there is an infinite
   ocean and sea, or gathering together of goodness. He cannot be better,
   he is summum bonum--the chiefest good; other things are good in
   subordination to him, and according to that use and proportion they
   bear to him. He is not good as the means, but as the end. Things good
   as the means are only good in order, proportion, measure, and respect;
   but God i absolutely good; beyond God there is nothing to be sought or
   aimed at; if we enjoy him we enjoy all good to make us completely
   happy. He is eternally and immutably good, for he cannot be less good
   than he is; as there can be no addition made to him, so no subtraction,
   or aught taken from him.

   2. God is morally good, that is, the fountain and pattern of all that
   virtuous goodness which is in the creatures. So Ps. xxv. 8, Good and
   upright is the Lord:' and Exod. xxxiii. 19, He said, I will make all my
   goodness go before thee, and proclaim my name.' As the creature hath a
   natural goodness of beauty, power, dominion, wisdom, so it hath a moral
   goodness of purity and holiness. Accordingly we must conceive in God
   his holiness, purity, veracity, justice, as his moral perfection and
   goodness, as his will is the supreme pattern and fountain of all these
   things in the creature.

   3. God is communicatively and beneficially good; that implieth his
   bounty and beneficence, or his will and self-propension to diffuse his
   benefits. It may be explained by these considerations:--

   [1.] That God hath in him whatsoever is useful and comfortable to ns.
   That is one notion we apprehend him by, that he is God all-sufficient,'
   Gen. xvii. 1, or that he hath all things at command, to do for us as
   our necessities shall require: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, For the Lord God is a
   sun and a shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing
   will he withhold from them that walk uprightly:' Gen. xv. 1, Fear not,
   Abraham; I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.' The privative
   and positive part is expressed in both these places, whether we need
   life or comfort, or would be protected from all dangers, bodily or
   spiritual. Why should we seek good out of God? Riches, pleasures,
   honours might more happily be had if we could possess all things in
   God: Jer. ii. 13, My people have committed two great evils; they have
   forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
   cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.' God is the fountain
   of all those things which are necessary to give us all good and defend
   us from all evil. Possidet possidentem omnia: 2 Cor. vi. 10, As having
   nothing, and yet possessing all things.'

   [2.] That he hath a strong inclination to let out his fulness, and is
   ready to do good upon all occasions: Thou art good and dost good.'
   Bonum est primum, et potissimum nomen Dei, saith Damascene--the
   chiefest name by which we conceive of God is his goodness. By that we
   know him, for that we love him and make our addresses to him: we admire
   him for his other titles and attributes, but this doth first insinuate
   with us, and invite our respects to him. The first means by which the
   devil sought to loosen man from God was by weakening the conceit of his
   goodness; and the great ground of all our commerce with him is that God
   is a good God: Ps. c. 4, 5, Enter ye into his courts with praise; be
   thankful unto him, and bless his name; for the Lord is good, his mercy
   is everlasting.' He presently inviteth the world to come to him,
   because he is good. As God is all-sufficient in himself, so he is
   communicative of his riches unto his creatures, and most of all to his
   own people. Goodness is communicative, it diffuseth itself, as the sun
   doth light, or as the fountain poureth out waters.

   [3.] He is the fountain of all that good we have or are. We have
   nothing but what we have from God: James i. 17, Every good gift and
   every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of
   lights:' and Jer. ii. 13, he is called the fountain of living waters.'
   As rivers are supplied by the sea, so the gathering together of all
   goodness is in God. All candles are lighted at his torch; there is
   nothing in the creature but what is derived from him: Who hath given to
   him first, and it shall be recompensed to him again?' Rom. xi. 35, as
   the sun oweth nothing to the beam, but the beam oweth all to the sun,
   and the sea oweth nothing to the river, but the river oweth all to the
   sea.

   [4.] There will a time come when he will be all in all,' 1 Cor. xv. 28,
   when God will immediately and in a fuller latitude communicate himself
   to his creatures, and there will need nothing beside himself to make us
   happy. Here we enjoy God, but not fully or immediately. We enjoy him in
   his creatures, but it is at the second or third hand; the creature
   interposeth between him and us: Hosea ii. 21, 22, And it shall come to
   pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord; I will hear the heavens,
   and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and
   the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.' In ordinances it
   is but a little strength and comfort that we get, such as is consistent
   with pain and sorrow; it is not full, because it is not immediate. A
   pipe cannot convey the whole fountain, nor the ordinances the full of
   God in Christ, only a little supply either as we need, or are able to
   receive; but then God will be all in all, he will do his work by
   himself; the narrowness of the means shall not straiten him, nor the
   weakness of the vessel hinder him to express the full of his goodness
   in full perfection.

   Secondly, How is his goodness manifested to us?

   1. In our creation, in that he did raise us up out of nothing to be
   what we are, and form us after his own image. God made us, not that he
   might be happy, but liberal, that there might be creatures to whom to
   communicate himself; our beings and faculties and powers were the
   fruits of his mere goodness. When God made the world, then was it
   verified, He is good, and doeth good.' Gen. i.; for as the goodness of
   his nature inclined him to make it, so his work was good: after every
   day's work there cometh in his approbation, Behold it was good; and
   when he had made man, and set him in a well-furnished world, and
   compared all his works together, then they were very good,' ver. 31.
   That he still fashioneth us in the womb, and raiseth us into that
   comely shape in which we afterwards appear, it is all the effect of his
   goodness.

   2. In our redemption; therein he commendeth his love and goodness in
   providing such a remedy for lost sinners. There is
   philanthropi'a--Titus iii. 4, But after that the kindness and love of
   God our Saviour towards man appeared.' In creation he showed himself
   phila'ngelos; in redemption, phila'nthropos, God is brought nearer to
   us as subsisting in our nature: 1 Tim. iii. 16, Great is the mystery
   godliness, God manifested in the flesh.' And so God had greater
   advantages to communicate himself to us in a more glorious way by the
   Redeemer, that we might for ever live in the admiration of his love.

   3. In daily providence; so the goodness of God is twofold:--

   [1.] Common and general to all creatures, especially to mankind: Ps.
   cxlv. 9, The Lord is good to all, his tender mercy is over all his
   works.' Upon all things and all persons he bestoweth many common
   blessings, as natural life, being, health, wealth, beauty, strength,
   and supplies necessary for them. There are none of God's creatures but
   taste of his bounty, and have sufficient proof that a good God made
   them and preserveth them. The young ravens: Ps. cxlvii. 9, He giveth to
   the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry,' epiba'llei
   tou`s neo'ttous e ko'rax. So the wicked: Mat. v. 45, He maketh his sun
   to shine on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and
   on the unjust;' Acts xiv. 17, Nevertheless he left not him self without
   witness, in that he did good, agathopoion, and gave us rain from heaven
   and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.' These
   common mercies argue a good God that giveth them, though not always a
   good people that receiveth them. This goodness of God showeth itself
   daily and bountifully.

   [2.] Special; God is good to all, but not to all alike. So he is good
   to his people, whom he blesseth with spiritual and saving benefits. So
   Lam. iii. 25, The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul
   that seeketh him.' So Ps. lxxxvi. 5, For thou, O Lord, art good, and
   ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon
   thee.' For this kind of goodness, a qualification is necessary in the
   receiver. Satan will tell you God is a good God, but he leaveth out
   this--to those that love and fear him, and wait upon him. This peculiar
   goodness yieldeth spiritual and saving blessings, such as pardoning of
   sins: Isa. lv. 7, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
   man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and lie will have
   mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon:'
   instruction in the ways of God in the text, Thou art good, and doest
   good: teach me thy statutes.' And, in short, all the means and helps
   that are necessary unto everlasting glory: 2 Thes. i. 11, Wherefore
   also we pray always for you, that God would count you worthy of this
   calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work
   of faith with power.' Once more, to the objects of his peculiar love
   common blessings are given in love, and with an aim at our good: Ps.
   lxxxiv. 11, No good thing will he withhold from them that walk
   uprightly.' So that the ordinary favours which others enjoy are
   sanctified to them. They are from love, and in bonum, for good. God is
   ready to help them onwards to their everlasting hopes, and that estate
   which they expect in the world to come, where, in the arms of God, they
   shall be blessed for evermore.

   Thirdly, Why ought those that come to God to have a deep sense of this?

   1. What is this deep sense?

   [1.] It must be the fruit of faith, believing God's being and bounty,
   or else it will have no force and authority upon us: Heb. xi. 6, He
   that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder
   of them that diligently seek him.' If we have but cold notions or dead
   opinions of the goodness of God, they will have little power on us. It
   is faith sets all things awork; there must be a sound belief of these
   things if we would practically improve them.

   [2.] It must be the fruit of constant observation of the effects of his
   goodness vouchsafed to us, so that we may give our thanks and praise
   for all that good we do enjoy. Careless spirits are not sensible of the
   hand of providence, never take notice of good or evil; therefore the
   Psalmist saith, Ps. cvii. 8, Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his
   goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!' He
   repeateth the same, ver. 15, 21, 31, and concludeth all ver. 43, Whoso
   is wise, and will observe those things, even they shall understand the
   loving-kindness of the Lord.' We are more backward to the observation
   of the goodness of God than we are to any duty; therefore doth the
   Psalmist stir up all sorts of persons to note the invisible hand of
   providence that reacheth out supplies to them: whether they have
   business by sea or by land, whether in sickness or in health, in all
   the varieties of the present life, he is still stirring them up to mind
   their mercies, and inviteth them by God's late favours to the praise
   and acknowledgment of his goodness, his communicating his goodness so
   freely to undeserving and ill-deserving persons, and following them
   with more and more mercies. There are none of us but have reasons
   enough and obligations enough lying upon us to make observations in
   this kind; every experience and new proof should put us upon this
   acknowledgment. Certainly they are the wisest sort of men who do
   observe God's providence.

   [3.] It is the fruit of deep and ponderous meditation. Glances never
   warm the heart; it is our serious and deliberate thoughts which affect
   us; therefore the children of God should be thinking of his goodness
   displayed in all his works, especially in redemption by Christ: Eph.
   iii. 18, 19, To comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of God which
   passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God.'
   To be ravished with love, affected with love, always thinking of love,
   speaking of love, expressing their sense of love, that is a work
   behoving saints. We should often meditate upon and set our minds awork
   upon this goodness by frequent and serious thoughts of it, for the
   strengthening of our faith and quickening of our love to God.

   [4.] It is the fruit of inward and spiritual taste: 1 Peter ii. 3, If
   so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' So Ps. xxxiv. 8,
   Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.' Do not be content with
   hearsay, but get a taste; that is, an inward and experimental knowledge
   of the goodness of God in Christ, that we may know it, not only by
   guess and imagination, but by sense and feeling: the one half of it
   cannot be told you. Optima demonstratio est a sensibus.

   2. Why we need to labour so much after a deep sense of this.

   [1.] To check our natural legalism, and the dark and distrustful
   prejudices of our own hearts. There is a secret guiltiness in us that
   breedeth misgiving thoughts of God. We have many suspicious thoughts of
   him, being guilty creatures, because we only represent him to ourselves
   as a consuming fire, or as clothed with justice and vengeance, watching
   an opportunity of doing us harm, and shut out all thoughts of goodness
   and mercy; yet when he proclaimeth his name, he telleth Moses he would
   make his goodness pass before him. God is wonderfully good in his
   nature, and he delighteth in the communications of his goodness:
   nothing pleaseth him better than his word; the business of it is to
   represent him good. Mercy pleaseth him: Micah vii. 18, Who is a God
   like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the
   transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his
   anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.' Mercy rejoiceth over
   judgment;' Ps. cxviii. 1, Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is
   good; because his mercy endureth for ever.' His works speak him good;
   there is no part of the world that we can set our eyes upon but it
   offereth matter of praise to God for his bounty to his creatures,
   especially to man: Ps. xxxiii. 5, The earth is full of the goodness of
   the Lord:' the whole earth is full of his goodness, and will you draw
   an ill picture of him in your minds, as if he were harsh and severe,
   and his service were intolerable? No; The Lord is good, and doth good.'

   [2.] That we may justify God against the prejudices of the unbelieving
   world, and invite them from our own experience to make trial of God. So
   Ps. xxxiv. 8, Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the
   man that trusteth in him.' A report of a report signifieth little; what
   we have found ourselves we can confidently recommend to others. When we
   have felt his dealing with ourselves, we can entreat them to see what
   waiting upon God will come to; let any man make the experiment, keep
   close to God in obedience and reliance, and he shall find him to be a
   gracious master; others that have dark thoughts of God, like the spies,
   they bring an ill report upon his ways.

   [3.] To humble the creature. We have not a right sight of God unless
   all created perfections vanish before him. The creatures are but some
   shadows, pictures, resemblances, or equivocal shapes of God. Whatever
   name they have of good, wise, strong, beautiful, true, or such like, it
   is but a borrowed speech from God, whose image they have; and if the
   creature usurpeth its being as originally belonging to themselves, it
   is as if the picture should call itself a true and living man. I am,
   and there is none beside me,' holdeth true of God's being, and all his
   perfections, natural or moral. The creatures may be good, or better, or
   best, compared among themselves; but we are frail and nothing if
   compared with God: There is none good but one, and that is God.' That
   goodness which we have in participation from him will appear no
   goodness in comparison of him. The heavens themselves are not clean in
   his sight: Job xxv. 5, 6, Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;
   yea the stars are not pure in his sight: how much less man that is a
   worm, and the son of man which is a worm?' And elsewhere, Job iv. 18,
   Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants, and his angels he chargeth
   with folly'--mutability in the angelical nature. When Isaiah had seen
   God, and heard the angels cry out, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
   hosts,' Isa. vi. 5, Then said I, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I
   am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
   unclean lips; and mine eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts.' The
   consideration of his goodness obscureth all the glory and praise of the
   creature; as when the sun is up the lustre of the stars is no more
   seen. When we compare ourselves with one another, one may be called
   bad, another good; but with God no man is good. He is good, but we are
   evil; he is heaven, but we are hell; he is all perfection, we are all
   weakness. In respect of his goodness, nothing in us deserveth that
   name, as lesser light in the view of a greater is darkness. When Job
   had seen God, he could not look upon himself with any patience: Job
   xlii. 5, 6, I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
   mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
   ashes.' That is a true sight of God that abaseth and lesseneth all
   things besides God, not only in opinion, but in affection and
   estimation. Alas! the best of us are scarce dark shadows of his
   goodness.

   [4.] God's goodness is the life of our faith and trust. So long as the
   goodness of God endureth for ever, we have no cause to be discouraged.
   If we want direction, in the text it is said, Thou art good, and dost
   good; teach me thy statutes.' If we want support and deliverance, Nahum
   i. 7, The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble, and he
   knoweth them that trust in him.' In every strait the people of God find
   him to be a good God. When we feel the burden of sin, and fear God's
   wrath, Ps. lxxxvi. 5, The Lord is good, and ready to forgive; and
   plenteous in mercy to all them that call upon him.' David, when his old
   sins troubled him, the sins of his youth, Ps. xxv. 7, Remember not the
   sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy
   remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord.' When his enemies
   consulted his ruin, Ps. li. 1, Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O
   mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.' They cannot take
   away the goodness of God from you, whatever they plot or purpose
   against you. Thus may faith triumph in all distresses upon the sense of
   the goodness of God. In the agonies of death, the goodness of God will
   be your support. Non sic vixi ut pudeat me inter vos vivere; nec mori
   timeo, quia bonum habeo Dominum. We have a good master, who will not
   see his servants unrewarded. The goodness of God, and his readiness to
   be gracious to every one that cometh to him, is the fountain of the
   saint's hope, strength, and consolation.

   [5.] The goodness of God is the great motive and invitation to
   repentance: Rom. ii. 4, Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
   forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God
   leadeth thee to repentance?' How so? God is good, but not to those that
   continue in their sins: Ps. lxviii. 19-21, Blessed be the Lord, who
   daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah.
   He that is our God is the God of salvation, and unto God the Lord
   belong the issues from death: but God shall wound the head of his
   enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his
   trespasses.' If goodness be despised, it will be turned into fury. How
   great soever the riches of the Lord's bounty and grace offered in
   Christ are, yet an impenitent sinner will not escape unpunished. God is
   good; oh! come, try, and see how good he will be to you, if you will
   turn and submit to him. There is hope offered, and goodness hath waited
   to save you; so that now you may seek his favour with hope to speed.
   While he sits upon the throne of grace, and alloweth the plea of the
   new covenant, do not stand off against mercies. God hath laid out the
   riches of his gracious goodness upon a design to save lost sinners; and
   will you turn back upon him, and despise all his goodness provided for
   you in Christ? In point of gratitude, the least kindness done men
   melteth them as coals of fire. The borrower is servant to the lender.
   God hath not only lent us, but given us all that we have; therefore it
   should break our hearts with sorrow and remorse that we should offend a
   God so good, so bountiful, so merciful. The odiousness of sin doth most
   appear in the unkindness of it; that infinite goodness hath been
   abused, and infinite goodness despised, and that you are willing to
   lose your part in infinite goodness, rather than not satisfy some base
   lust, or look after some trifling vanity. Saul wept at the thoughts of
   David's kindness, 1 Sam. xxiv. 16. Every man will condemn the wrongs
   done to one that hath done us no evil, but much good; and will you sin
   against God, who is so good in himself, so good to all his creatures,
   and so good to you, and waiteth to be better and more gracious; and
   return evil for all his good, and requite his love with nothing but
   unkindness and provocation? Oh, be ashamed of all these things! What
   heart is that that can offend, and so willingly offend, so good a God!
   Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you by the mercies of God (there is argument and
   endearment enough in that) that ye present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service,' that ye consecrate, dedicate yourselves to his glory, address
   yourselves cheer fully to his service. Let the soul be warmed into an
   earnest resolution to please him for the future, lest you make goodness
   your enemy, and justice take up the quarrel of abused grace.

   [6.] The goodness of God is the great argument to move us to love God.
   If he be good, he is worthy to be loved, and that with a superlative
   love; for God is both the object and the measure of love. A less good
   should be loved less, and a greater good more. All that is not God is
   but a finite and limited good, and must be loved accordingly. God only
   is infinite and eternal, and therefore he is to be loved of all, and
   above all, with our chiefest and most worthy love, by preferring his
   glory above all things that are dear to us, and being content for his
   sake to part with all that we have in the world. But if any lower thing
   prevail with us, we prefer it before God, and so contemn his goodness
   in comparison of it. If the object of love be good, none so properly
   deserveth our love as God. For (1.) He is originally good, the fountain
   of all good; therefore if we leave God for the deceitful vanities of
   this present life, we leave the fountain of living waters,' for a
   broken cistern,' Jer. ii. 13. The creatures are but dry pits and broken
   cisterns. (2.) He is summum bonum, the chiefest good. Other things,
   what good they have, they have it from him; therefore it is infinitely
   better and greater in him than in them; all the good that is in the
   creature is but a spark of what is in God. If we find any good there,
   it is not to detain our affections, but to lead us to the greater good,
   not to hold us from him, but to lead us to him, as the streams lead to
   the fountain, and the steps of a ladder are not to stand still upon,
   but that we may ascend higher. There is goodness in the creature, but
   mixed with imperfection; the good is to draw to him, the imperfection
   to drive us off from the creature. (3.) He is in finitely good. Other
   things may busy us and vex us, but they cannot satisfy us; this alone
   sufficeth for health, wealth, peace, protection, grace, glory.
   Necessities that are not satisfied in God are but fancies, and the
   desires that are hurried out after them, apart from God, are not to be
   satisfied, but mortified. If we have not enough in God, it is not the
   default of our portion, but the distemper of our hearts. In choosing
   God for our portion, one hath not the less because another enjoyeth it
   with him: here is a sharing without division, and a par taking without
   the prejudice of copartners. We straiten others in worldly things so
   much as we are enlarged ourselves; finite things cannot be divided, but
   they must be lessened; they are not large enough to be parted; but
   every one possesseth all that is good in God who hath God for his
   portion; as the same speech may be heard of all, and yet no man heareth
   the less because others hear it with him, or as no man hath the less
   light because the sun shineth on more than himself: the Lord is all in
   all; the more we possess him the better. As in a choir of voices, every
   one is not only solaced with his own voice, but with the harmony of
   those that sing in concert with him. Many a fair stream is drawn dry by
   being dispersed into several channels, but that which is infinite will
   suffice all. (4.) He is eternally good: Ps. lxxiii. 26, God is the
   strength of my heart, and my portion forever.' The good things of this
   life are perishing and of a short continuance; we leave other good
   things when we come to take full possession of God. At death wicked men
   perceive their error, when the good they have chosen cometh to be taken
   from them; but a man that hath chosen God then entereth into the full
   possession of him; that which others shun, he longeth for, waiting for
   that time when the creature shall cease, and God shall be all in all.
   Oh! let all these things persuade us to love God, and so to love him
   that our hearts may be drawn off from other things. Let us love him
   because of the goodness and amiableness of his nature, because of his
   bounty in our creation, redemption, and daily providence, and because
   he will be our God for ever.

   [7.] God's goodness is our consolation and support in all afflictions.
   God is a gracious father, and all that he doth is acts of grace and
   goodness; even the sharpest of his administrations are absolutely the
   best for us: Ps. lxxiii. 1, Truly God is good to Israel;' all his work
   is good; as in the six days, so in constant providence, it is either
   good or it will turn to good: Rom. viii. 28, All things shall work
   together for good to them that love God.' God may change our condition,
   yet he doth not change his affection to us; he is all good, and doth
   that which we shall find good at length.

   [8.] It is the ground of prayer; if we lack any good thing, he hath it,
   and is ready to communicate it. The goodness of God, as it doth stir up
   desire in us, so hope; as it stirreth a desire to communicate of his
   fulness, so a hope that surely the good God will hear us. He is not
   sparing of what he can do for us: James i. 5, If any of you lack
   wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and
   upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Our wants send us to the
   promises, and the promises to God.

   Use 1. To press us to imitate our heavenly Father; you should be good
   and do good, as he is good and doth good; for every disposition in God
   should leave an answerable character and impression upon their souls
   that profess themselves to be made partakers of a divine nature;
   therefore it should be our great care and study to be as good and do as
   much good as we possibly can. He is one like God that is good and doth
   good; therefore still be doing good to all, especially to the household
   of faith: Gal. vi. 10, As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good
   to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith;'
   with Mat. v. 44, 45, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
   good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you
   and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is
   in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
   and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;' Luke vi. 35, But love
   ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and
   your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the
   Highest; for he is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil;' 2 Peter
   i. 7, Add to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness,
   charity.' Not doing good to our own party, or those of our friendship,
   but to all. So generally all good is to be done, as well as that of
   bounty and beneficence: Luke vi. 45, A good man, out of the good
   treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things;' and it is said of
   Barnabas, Acts xi. 24, He was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost
   and of faith.' A good man is always seeking to make others good, as
   fire turneth all things about it into fire. The title signifies one not
   only of a mild disposition, but of a holy, heavenly heart, that maketh
   it his business to honour God. So Joseph of Arimathea is said to be a
   good man, and a just;' this is to be like God.

   Use 2. Direction to you in the business of the Lord's supper: God is
   good, and doeth good.

   1. Here you come to remember his goodness to you in Christ. Now the
   goodness of God should never be thought on, or commemorated, but your
   hearts should be raised in the wonder and admiration of it: Ps. xxxi.
   19, Oh, how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
   that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee!'
   and Ps. xxxvi. 7, How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore
   the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.'
   This should be delightful work to you, and not gone about with dead and
   careless hearts. We cannot express ourselves many times; strong
   passions do not easily get a vent; little things may be greatened by
   us, but great things indeed strike us dumb. However, our hearts should
   be deeply affected and possessed with this; we should be full of such
   admiring thoughts.

   2. We come for a more intimate and renewed taste. By taste, I mean
   spiritual sense, to have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by
   the Holy Ghost given to us,' Rom. v. 5. We come to the feast of the
   soul that our hungry consciences may taste of the fatness of God's
   house, Ps. lxv. 4; that our thirsty souls may drink of the rivers of
   his pleasure, Ps. xvi. 11; to have some pledge of the joys of heaven,
   if not to ravishment and sensible reviving, yet such as may put us out
   of relish with carnal vanities; some gracious experiences that may make
   us long for more, and go away lauding God.

   3. To stir up our love to God as the most lovely and suitable object to
   our souls; in him is nothing but good. God is goodness itself: he is
   one that has deserved your love, and will satisfy and reward your love.
   All the good we have in an ordinance it is from him, and to lead up our
   souls to him. Our business now is to love God, who loved us first,' 1
   John iv. 19; to love him by devoting ourselves to him, and to
   consecrate our all to his service.

   4. To desire more communion with him, and to long after the blessed
   fruition of him, when God shall be all in all, not only be chief, but
   all, when we shall perfectly enjoy the infinite God, when the chiefest
   good will give us the greatest blessings, and an infinite eternal God
   will give us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The
   word, sacraments, and prayer convey but little to you in comparison of
   that, when God is object and means, and all things. The soul is then
   all for Christ, and Christ all for the soul. Your whole employment is
   to love him, live upon him. Here we give away some of our love, some of
   our thoughts and affections, on other things; Christ, is crowded, hath
   not room to lay forth the glory of his grace; but there is full scope
   to do it.

SERMON LXXVIII.

   Teach me thy statutes.--Ver. 68.

   SECONDLY, we come to David's petition, Teach me thy statutes;' which I
   shall be brief in, because it doth often occur in the verses of this
   psalm. David's petition is to understand the word that he might keep
   it. Teaching bringeth us under the power of what is taught, and
   increaseth sanctification both in heart and life, as well as
   illumination or information.

   Doct. One chief thing which they that believe and have a sufficient
   apprehension of God's goodness should seek of him in this world, is
   understanding the way of salvation.

   This request is enforced out of the former title and compellation.

   1. Because the saving knowledge of his will is one principal effect of
   his bounty and beneficence. As he showeth love to man above other
   creatures, in that he gave him such a life as was light, John i.
   4--that is, had reason and understanding joined with it--so to his
   people above other men, that he hath given them a saving knowledge of
   the way of salvation since sin: Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the
   Lord; he will teach sinners the way.' It is a great discovery of God's
   goodness that he will teach sinners, a favour not vouchsafed to the
   fallen angels: it is more than if he gave us the wealth of the whole
   world; that will not conduce to such a high use and purpose as this.
   More of his good will and special love is seen in this, to teach us the
   way how to enjoy him. Eternal life is begun by this saving knowledge:
   John xvii. 3, And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the
   only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.'

   2. This is one principal way whereby we show our sense of God's
   goodness. That is a true apprehension of God's goodness which giveth us
   confidence and hope of the saving fruits of it, when, the oftener we
   think of it, the more of sanctification we seek to draw from this
   fountain of goodness. That is an idle speculation that doth not beget
   trust, an empty praise, a mere compliment that doth not produce a real
   confidence in God, that he will give us spiritual blessings when we
   heartily desire them. True knowledge of God's name breedeth trust: Ps.
   ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their trust in thee:' and more
   particularly for this kind of benefit. It is a general encouragement:
   Mat. vii. 11, If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
   your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
   good things to them that ask him?' But it is limited to the Spirit:
   Luke xi. 13, If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
   children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Spirit to
   them that ask it?' Without this faith there is no commerce with God.

   3. It is an argument of the good temper of our souls not to serve our
   carnal turns, but promote the welfare of our souls, when we would enjoy
   and improve the goodness of God to get this benefit.

   [1.] They are affected according to the value of the thing. Of all the
   fruits of God's goodness which a holy man would crave for himself and
   challenge for his portion, this he thinketh fittest to be
   sought--sanctifying grace to understand and keep the law. If this be
   not the only, yet it is the chiefest benefit which they desire in the
   world. For other things, let God deal with them as he will; but they
   value this among the greatest things which God bestoweth on mankind.
   Observe here how much the spirit of God's children differeth from the
   spirit of the world; they account God hath dealt well with them when he
   bestoweth upon them wealth and honour: Ps. iv. 6, Who will show us any
   good?' but the other desire grace to know God's will, and to serve and
   please him: there is the thing they desire and seek after, as suiting
   their temper and constitution of soul. A man is known by his desires,
   as the temper of his body by his pulse.

   [2.] They would not willingly sin against God, either out of ignorance
   or perverse affections; therefore, if God will direct them and assist
   them in the work of obedience, their great care and trouble is over. It
   is a good sign that a man hath a simple, honest spirit, when there is
   rooted in his heart a fear to offend God, and a care to please him. He
   may err in many things, but God accepts him as long as seeking
   knowledge in order to obedience, Eph. v. 15-17. All that God requireth,
   both for matter and manner, is, that we would not comply with sin;
   seeing the time is evil and full of snares, we should not be unwise in
   point of duty.

   [3.] They have a holy jealousy of themselves. David desired to use
   every condition well, whether he were in prosperity or trouble. The
   context speaketh of afflictions that were sanctified; but a new
   condition might bring on a new alteration in the soul. Prosperity would
   make him forget God, and trouble overwhelm him, if God did not teach
   him. In what state soever we be, we must desire to be taught of God,
   otherwise we shall fail: Phil. iv. 11, 12, For I have learned, in
   whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content: I know how to be
   abased, and how to abound; everywhere and in all things I am
   instructed.' Unless the Lord guide us, we shall be as Ephraim was, a
   cake not turned,' Hosea vii. 8, baked but on one side, quite dough and
   raw on the other side; fail in the next condition, though passed over
   one well.

   [4.] A sense of the creature's mutability. Comparing it with the former
   verse, I observe, that though he kept God's commandments, yet he
   craveth further grace, and desireth that he may be still taught,
   because he knew not all that he might know, and was ready to err both
   in practice and judgment: and this must teach us to desire God's
   guidance and direction, not only when we have erred, but when we do
   well. Many, when they have smarted for their errors, will desire God to
   teach them; but David kept this continual dependence upon God for daily
   grace, both for turning away of evil, and also for doing good: Prov.
   iii. 5, 6, Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not upon
   thine own understanding: in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
   direct thy paths:' which we are to follow in our places and callings.
   We are apt to ascribe too much to our present frame and resolutions.
   God must still be called to for his counsel and blessing in every
   business.

   [5.] An evangelical frame. He pleadeth not merit, appealeth not to
   justice, but to God's grace and goodness. This should be the special
   groundwork of our prayers. The Lord doth all to the praise of his
   glorious grace,' Eph. i. 7; and he will not have that glory in fringed,
   either in part or in whole. The Spirit of God is very tender of it in
   scripture, and we should be very tender of it in our addresses to God,
   that all conceits of our own worth be laid aside, and that we wholly
   fly to God's goodness and mercy. The whole work of sanctification, from
   its first step to its last period, is all of grace, all must be
   ascribed to God's free goodness.

   [6.] The will of God revealed in scripture is a subject that is never
   perfectly known. While we are in the way to glory there is always some
   new thing to be learned of it and from it, even by those that are the
   greatest proficients in the knowledge of it; and therefore we must be
   still scholars in this school, and when we have learned never so much
   we must still be learning more. This is continued, lasting work, for
   David is ever and anon at his old request, Lord, teach me thy
   statutes;' and not without reason, since it is not sufficient to know
   God's will in some few great and weighty actions of our lives, but in
   all, whether of greater or lesser concernments. And when we know
   generals, yet we are so apt to err in particular cases, and since the
   commandment of God is so exceeding broad, Ps. cxix. 96. Every day we
   may see more into it, and may be more fully informed of the mind of
   God. We every day see more in a promise than we did before, in a
   precept than we did before; therefore the apostle saith, 1 Cor. viii.
   2, And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing
   yet as he ought to know.'

   Use. Here is a pattern and precedent for us; especially now w& have
   engaged our souls to God, let us seek this directive grace. It implieth
   pardon, and that maketh way for joy and comfort; for God teacheth
   pardoned sinners. A sure light and direction prevents many troubles of
   spirit and anxious doubts. It is a pledge and assurance of our getting
   home to God; those whom God guideth are sure to be safe in the issue.

   1. It showeth what should be the matter of our prayers. David beggeth
   not to increase him in riches and honours, nor to flow in temporal
   delights. No; if God would show himself a good God to him, he desireth
   it may be in giving him the spirit of understanding, and some increase
   of holiness; this he would take as the principal sign of God's favour
   and grace to him. The world generally imploreth God's goodness to
   another end; they think they are dealt liberally with when every man
   hath his lust satisfied: they pray from the intemperateness of the
   flesh; but David professeth it was enough to him if he might find God
   answering him in that one thing which most others neglect and pass by
   in their prayers, or, if they mention it, it is for fashion's sake, and
   to comport with the usual way of praying. But because there is great
   deceit, and we often pray for what we have no mind to have granted, let
   us see if this be our temper.

   [1.] We must discover it in our thanksgiving and blessing God for this
   gift, though he denieth us other which make a fair show in the world:
   Mat. xi. 25-27, At that time Jesus answered and said,' I thank thee, O
   Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
   from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so,
   Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered to
   me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither
   knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
   will reveal him.' Christ showeth that the mystery of grace is at God's
   disposing, who manifests it as he seeth good; that if he hath cut us
   short in other things, and been liberal to us in this, we should not
   only be contented, but highly thankful; and how contemptible soever we
   be in the world, yet it is matter of praise and thanksgiving in that
   God hath bestowed his grace and love to us according to his will and
   pleasure.

   [2.] By our patience and contentedness in the want and loss of other
   things for this thing's sake; want, if God's providence be so; loss, if
   occasioned by our adherence to truth. Want: we have no reason to envy
   carnal men: Ps. xvii. 14, 15, From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from
   men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
   belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children,
   and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. But as for me, I
   will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I
   awake with thy likeness.' We have no reason to repine; our present
   condition of entertaining communion with God in a practice of holiness
   countervaileth all their happiness, especially our future hopes to
   increase in knowledge and abound in the work of the Lord; and to own
   and stand up for a hated and despised truth will bring more comfort to
   our souls than all the pleasure the wicked have in their sensual
   delights. Are they the happy men that go on in opposition against the
   ways of God? Prov. iii. 31-33, Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose
   none of his ways: for the froward is an abomination to the Lord, but
   his secret is with the righteous. The curse of the Lord is in the house
   of the wicked, but he blesseth the habitation of the just.' They are
   not happier than the godly; it is a greater happiness to know more of
   God's mind than anything they enjoy: John xv. 15, Henceforth I call you
   not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I
   call you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have
   made known unto you.'

   [3.] By our constancy in prayer, and earnest supplication to know more
   of the mind of God. They will not be put off with other things. God
   gave the Spirit to the rest of the apostles, but he gave the purse to
   the son of perdition. Men may have a fit of devotion in their prayers,
   but their general course is not answerable: Mat. vi. 33, First seek the
   kingdom of God.' If we seek it in good earnest we shall show it in our
   conversation and demeanour: Prov. iv. 7, Wisdom is the principal thing,
   therefore get wisdom; and with all thy getting get understanding.' This
   must be the chiefest thing that beareth sway in our endeavours, that we
   may know more of God's mind in following our suits incessantly, we must
   not be put off; though God giveth other things, you must not cease your
   importunity. Lord, I expect something else from thy goodness; see Ps.
   cxix. 132, 133, Look upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
   do to them that fear thy name. Order my steps in thy word, and let no
   iniquity have dominion over me;' and Ps. xxvii. 7, Hear me, God. when I
   cry with my voice; have mercy upon me, and answer me;' if we do not
   suffer this desire to languish and die, but still it he recommended to
   God daily. My business is rightly to understand and perfectly to do thy
   will; this is my one and great request, which I will ever and ever
   urge. I cannot give over this prayer till thou beest all in all, and
   showest me the utmost of thy bounty. We desire many things, but we are
   soon put out of the humour; as children, that seem passionately and
   pettishly to desire a thing, but by presenting other things to them
   they are diverted and stilled; but it is not so with God's people. As
   Naomi said of Boaz, Ruth iii. 18, For the man will not be in rest until
   he have finished the thing this day;' so a child of God will not be
   satisfied till his desire be in some measure accomplished.

   2. In what manner we should pray.

   [1.] With earnestness. Slight prayers bespeak their own denial: Prov.
   ii. 1-5, My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
   commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear to wisdom, and
   apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after
   knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest
   her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt
   thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.'

   [2.] With confidence: he is wont to do it for you. Ask nothing contrary
   to his nature. We should come with a confidence of speeding; there is
   in him a propensity and inclination to help us. What would ye do to a
   hunger-bitten child if he cometh to you for a knife or an apple? You
   would deny him them, but not meat to satisfy his hunger. If for bread
   to play with, or meat when he hath enough, you would deny him, not
   gratify his fancy: if he come to be taught his book, you would readily
   hear him. So when we come not for temporal things, but spiritual
   comforts, when spiritual comforts are not asked out of course, and for
   form's sake, yea, not only for comforts, but necessary grace to do his
   will, surely it cannot be that he should cast off them that love him,
   and would fain be conformed to his will, that come humbly, and long,
   and pray, and seek for his grace.

   [3.] That this confidence must be evangelical. He sets before his eyes
   God's goodness, or readiness to be gracious to all that call upon him;
   so that all the hope we have to prevail should not be taken from
   anything in us, but something in God himself. We must expect and ask
   blessings from God, for God, and because of God's sake. It is not for
   any good we deserve, or have done, or can do, that God taketh care of
   his weak foolish children, but for the glory of his name, his grace and
   constant goodness. God is our fountain, our reasons are his goodness,
   our end his glory. This is the true way of addressing ourselves to God,
   deprecating sins for which he may harden us, and remembering his
   mercies on which we ground our hope. So doth David: Ps. xxv. 5, 6, Lead
   me in thy truth, teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation; on
   thee do I wait all the day. Remember, O Lord, thy loving-kindnesses and
   thy mercies; for they have been ever of old.' His eternal love is
   assigned as the cause of all: Ps. xxiii. 3, He leadeth us in paths of
   righteousness, for his name's sake.

   3. What should be the grounds and impelling principle of prayer.

   [1.] A strong bent to please God, and that all your affections and
   actions may be ordered so as to be acceptable in his sight. Those that
   stand in awe of God are loath to offend him; they may expect direction
   and light in all difficult cases: Ps. xxv. 12, What man is he that
   feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose;'
   ver. 14, The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will
   show them his covenant.'

   [2.] A desire to enjoy him; for these things are valuable as they lead
   us to God. Our solid joy lieth not in outward things, but in our
   communion with God: Ps. cxxxix. 24, Lead me in the way everlasting;'
   and Ps. lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterward
   receive me to thy glory.' Their business is to be happy hereafter, and
   well guided here, that they may attain that happiness. Now there is an
   inseparable connection between our walking in the time of this life,
   and receiving into heaven after this life; and he that is resolved to
   walk by the rule of God's direction, may promise himself to be received
   into glory after his journey is ended. So Ps. xliii. 3, Send out thy
   light and thy truth to lead me to thy holy hill.' They would fain take
   the nearest way to heaven, and follow God's counsel in all things. We
   have his word continually to guide us in this way, but we need also the
   assistance of his Spirit. The promised rest is much in their eye, and
   doth mightily prevail with him: they would have God to be their guide
   here, that he may be their rest hereafter.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXXIX.

   It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy
   statutes.--Ver. 71.

   THE context speaketh of afflictions by occasion of persecutions. The
   proud had forged a lie against him, and involved him in many troubles,
   when in the meantime their heart was as fat as grease.' They wallowed
   in ease and pleasure, but David kept right with God; and yet his
   afflictions do not cease. God doth not presently take away opposition,
   because of our proud, unhumbled, unmortified spirits, though we hold
   fast our integrity for the main: therefore he comforteth himself in his
   spiritual protection under the affliction, though the affliction was
   not removed: It is good,' &c.

   In the words there is--

   1. An assertion, it is good for me that I have been afflicted.

   2. The reason, that I might learn thy statutes. Or, here is a general
   truth explained by a particular instance. In the general, he saith it
   is good, and then what good he got by it.

   Doct. That affliction, all things considered, is rather good than evil.

   The assertion is a paradox to vulgar sense and the ears of the common
   sort of men. How few are there in the world that will grant that it is
   good to be afflicted! Yea, the children of God can scarcely subscribe
   to the truth of it till the affliction be over. While they are under it
   they feel the smart, but do not presently discern the benefit; but in
   the review they find God hath ordered it with much wisdom and
   faithfulness; and in the issue they say, as David doth, It is good for
   me that I have been afflicted.' Carnal sense is not easily persuaded,
   but the new nature prevaileth at length, and then they readily
   subscribe to the truth of it.

   The word is clear on this point: Job v. 17, Behold, happy is the man
   whom the Lord correcteth.' The first word, behold, summoneth our
   attention and observation. What is the matter? As those that are before
   Joseph cried, Abreck, bow the knee,' Gen. xli. 43, to show some eminent
   person was at hand, so this behold calleth for reverence and
   admiration; there is some strange truth to ensue and follow. Happiness
   in the lowest notion, it includeth a freedom from misery; and yet the
   scripture pronounces the man happy whom the Lord correcteth. There have
   been among the heathens many opinions about happiness. Two hundred and
   eighty-eight Austin reckoneth up; but none ever placed it in
   correction, in sickness, disgrace, exile, captivity, loss of friends,
   much less in God's correction, who is our supreme judge, to whom we
   ultimately appeal when others wrong us. And yet the corrected man, and
   the man corrected by the Lord, is happy, though not with a consummate
   happiness; he hath not the happiness of his country, but he hath the
   happiness of the way. The man is kept by the way, that he may come to
   his country. His afflictions take nothing from him but his sin.
   Therefore his solid happiness remaineth not infringed, rather the more
   secured. So Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O
   Lord, and teachest out of thy law.' To be chastened of God for what we
   have done amiss, and by that means to be reduced to the sense and
   practice of our duty, is one of the greatest blessings on this side
   heaven that can light upon us. It is an evidence of God's tender care
   over us, and that he will not lose us, and suffer us to perish with the
   unbelieving and sinful world.

   The truth lieth clearly in the scripture; but to reconcile it with our
   prejudices--

   1. I shall show by what measure we are to determine good and evil.

   2. Prove that affliction is good.

   First, For the measure.

   1. This good is not to be determined by our fancies and conceits, but
   by the wisdom of God; for God knoweth better what is good for us than
   we do for ourselves, and foreseeth all things by one infinite act of
   understanding, but we judge according to present appearance; therefore
   all is to be left to God's disposal, and his divine choice is to be
   preferred before our foolish fancies, and what he sendeth and
   permitteth to fall out is fitter for us than anything else. Could we
   once assuredly be persuaded of this, a Christian would be completely
   fortified, and fitted not only for a patient but a cheerful
   entertainment of all that is or shall come upon him. Besides, he is a
   God of bowels, and loveth us dearly, better than we do ourselves; and
   therefore we should be satisfied with his dispensations whatever they
   are, whether according to or against our will. The shepherd must choose
   the pastures for the sheep, whether lean or fat, bare or full grown;
   the child is not to be governed by his own fancy, but the father's
   discretion; nor the sick man by his own appetite, but the physician's
   skill. It is expedient sometimes that God should make his people sad
   and displease them for their advantage: John xvi. 6, 7, Because I have
   said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your hearts:
   nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go
   away.' We are too much addicted to our own conceits: Christ's dealing
   is expedient and useful when yet it is very unsatisfactory to us: he is
   to be judge of what is good for us, his going or tarrying, not we
   ourselves, who are short-sighted and distempered with passions, whose
   requests many times are but ravings, and ask of God we know not what,
   as the two brethren, Mat. xx. 22, and seek our bane as a blessing, as
   children would play with a knife that would cut and wound them, pray
   our selves into a mischief and a snare. It were the greatest misery if
   God should carve out our condition according to our own fancy and
   desires. Peter said, Mat. xvii. 4, Master, it is good for us to be
   here:' he was well pleased to be upon Mount Tabor, but little thought
   what service God had to do for him elsewhere, how much poor souls
   needed him and the other apostles' help. We would always be in the
   mount with God, enjoy our comforts to the full, even to surfeit; but
   God knows that is not good for us. His pleasure should satisfy us
   though we do not see the reason of it. So Jer. xxiv. 5, God speaketh of
   the basket of good figs (whereby were represented the best of the
   people) whom I have sent into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
   What can there be seemingly more contrary to their good than a hard and
   an afflicted lot out of their own country? Yet God, that foresaw all
   things, knew it was for their good; worse evils would befall the place
   where they had been. So to be kept under, to have no service for the
   present, no hopes to rise again for the future, and to be laden with
   all manner of prejudices and reproaches, this is for good. We think not
   so, but God knoweth it is so, most for his glory and our benefit. So
   the selling of Joseph into Egypt, Gen. 1. 20, God meant it to good.'
   Alas! what good to have the poor young man sold as a slave, to be cast
   into prison for his chastity and continency, and exposed to all manner
   of difficulties 1 But alas! many had perished if he had not been sent
   thither. So God taketh away many beloved comforts from us; he meaneth
   it for good. We think it is all against us; no, it is for us. So Ps.
   xxxiv. 10, They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.' Many
   times they want food and raiment, want liberty, at least in some
   degree; they may want many things that are comfortable; though they
   have things sparingly, though they have of the meanest, yet they have
   that which is good for them. So Ps. lxxxiv. 11, No good thing will he
   withhold.' He may keep us low and bare, feed us cibo extemporali, as
   Lactantius; but that is good for us. If it were good for us to have
   larger revenues and incomes, we should not want them. The true and
   absolute ground of all submission is to think that which God sendeth is
   good, be it prosperity or adversity, the having or wanting children, or
   other comforts.

   2. The next measure is this, that good is to be determined by its
   respect to the chief good or true happiness. Now, what is our chief
   happiness but the enjoyment of God? Our happiness doth not consist in
   outward comforts, riches, health, honour, civil liberty, or comfortable
   relations, as husband, wife, children; but in our relation to and
   acceptance with God. Other things are but additional appendages to our
   happiness, Mat. vi. 33. Affliction taketh nothing from our essential
   solid happiness, rather helpeth us in the enjoyment of it, as it
   increaseth grace and holiness, and so we enjoy God more surely. That is
   good that sets us nearer to God, and that is evil which separateth us
   from him; therefore sin is evil, because it maketh an estrangement
   between us and God, Isa. lix. 2; but affliction is good, because many
   times it maketh us the more earnestly to seek after him: Hosea v. 15,
   In their afflictions they will seek me right early.' Therefore every
   condition is good or evil as it sets farther off or draws us nearer to
   God; that is good that tendeth to make us better, more like unto God,
   capable of communion with him, conduceth to our everlasting happiness.
   So It is good that a man bear the yoke from his youth,' Lam. iii. 27,
   that he be trained up under the cross, in a constant obedience to God
   and subjection to him, and so be fitted to entertain communion with
   him. If afflictions conduce to this end, they are good, for then they
   help us to enjoy the chief good.

   3. That good is not always the good of the flesh, or the good of
   outward prosperity; and therefore the good of our condition is not to
   be deter mined by the interest of the flesh, but the welfare of our
   souls. If God should bestow upon us so much of the good of the outward
   and animal life as we desire, we could not be said to be in a good
   condition if he should deny us good spiritual. We should lose one half
   of the blessings of the covenant by doting upon and falling in love
   with the rest: the flesh is importunate to be pleased, but God will not
   serve our carnal turns. We are more concerned as a soul than a body:
   Heb. xii. 10, He verily for our profit, that we may be partakers of his
   holiness.' Certain it is God will chasten us for our profit. What do we
   call profit? The good things of this world, the great mammon which so
   many worship? If we call it so, God will not; he meaneth to impart to
   us spiritual and divine benefit, which is a participation of his own
   holiness. And truly the people of God, if they be in their right
   temper, value themselves not by their outward enjoyments, but their
   inward, by their improvement of grace, not the enjoyment of worldly
   comforts: 2 Cor. iv. 16, Tor this cause we faint not, but though our
   outward man perish, our inward man is renewed day by day.' A discerning
   Christian puts more value upon holiness wrought by affliction than upon
   all his comforts. So that though affliction be evil in itself, it is
   good as sanctified.

   4. A particular good must give way to a general good, and our personal
   benefit to the advancement of Christ's kingdom. The good of the church
   must be preferred before our personal contentment. Paul could want the
   glory of heaven for a while, if his continuance in the flesh were
   needful for the saints: Phil. i. 24, To abide in the flesh is more
   needful for you.' We must not so desire good to our selves as to hinder
   the good of others. All elements will act contrary to their particular,
   for the conservation of the universe. That may be good for the glory of
   God which is not good for our personal contentment and ease. Now the
   glory of God is our greatest interest; if it be for the glory of God
   that I should be in pain, bereft of my comforts, my sanctified
   subjection to the will of God must say it is good. John xii. 27, 28,
   there you have expressed the innocent inclination of Christ's human
   nature, Father, save me from this hour:' and the overruling sense of
   his duty, or the obligation of his office, But for this cause came I to
   this hour.' We are often tossed and tumbled between inclination of
   nature and conscience of duty; but in a gracious heart the sense of our
   duty and the desire of glorifying God should prevail above the desire
   of our own comfort, ease, safety, and welfare. Nature would be rid of
   trouble, but grace submits all our interests to God's honour, which
   should be dearer to us than anything else.

   5. This good is not to be determined by present feeling, but by the
   judgment of faith. Affliction for the present is not pleasant to
   natural sense, nor for the present is the fruit evident to spiritual
   sense, but it is good because in the issue it turneth to good: Rom.
   viii. 28, All things work together for good.' While God is striking we
   feel the grief, and the cross is tedious, but when we see the end, we
   acknowledge it is good to be afflicted: Heb. xii. 11, No affliction for
   the present seemeth joyous, but grievous; but afterwards it yieldeth
   the peaceable fruits of righteousness.' A good present is the cause of
   joy, and an evil present is the cause of sorrow; but there are two
   terms of abatement: the sorrow is from the present sense, and the
   conceit of the sufferer. When we are but newly under the affliction, we
   feel the smart, but do not presently find the benefit; but within a
   while, especially in the review, it is good for me; it is matter of
   faith under the affliction, it is matter of sense after it. Good physic
   must have time to work. That which is not good may be good; though it
   be not good in its nature, it is good in its seasonable use, and though
   for the present we see it not, we shall see it. Therefore good is not
   to be determined by feeling, but by faith. The rod is a sore thing for
   the present, but the bitter root will yield sweet fruit. If we come to
   a person under the cross, and ask him, What I is it good to feel the
   lashes of God's correcting hand, to be kept poor and sickly, exercised
   with losses and reproaches, to part with friends and relations, to lose
   a beloved child? sense will complain. But this poor creature, after he
   hath been exercised and mortified, and gotten some renewed evidences of
   God's favour, ask him then is it good to be afflicted? Oh, yes! I had
   else been vain, neglectful of God, wanted such an experience of the
   Lord's grace. Faith should determine the case when we feel it not.

   Secondly, That according to these measures you will find it good to be
   afflicted.

   1. It is good as it is minus malum, it keepeth us from greater evils.
   Afflictions to the righteous are either cures of or preservatives from
   spiritual evils, which would occasion greater troubles and crosses.
   They prevent sin: 2 Cor. xii. 7, And lest I should be exalted above
   measure through the abundance of revelation, there was given me a thorn
   in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
   exalted above measure.' They purge out sin: Isa. xxvii. 9, By this
   shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged out.' We are apt to abuse
   prosperity to self-confidence: Ps. xxx. 6, 7, In my prosperity I said,
   I shall never be moved. Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain
   to stand strong.' And luxury: Deut. xxxii. 15, But Jeshurun waxed fat
   and kicked; thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered
   with fatness; then he forsook God that made him, and lightly esteemed
   the rock of his salvation.' The godly have evil natures as well as
   others, which cannot be beaten down but by afflictions. We are froward
   in our relations. Hagar was proud in Abraham's house, Gen. xvi. 4, her
   mistress was despised in her eyes; but very humble in the desert, Gen.
   xxi. 16. David's heart was tender and smote him when he cut off the lap
   of Saul's garment, 1 Sam. xxiv. 5; but how stupid and senseless was he
   when he lived at ease in Jerusalem! 2 Sam. xii. His conscience was
   benumbed till Nathan roused him. Before we are chastened we are
   rebellious, frail, fickle, mutable, apt to degenerate without this
   continual discipline: we are very negligent and drowsy till the rod
   awakeneth us. God's children have strange failings and negligences, and
   sometimes are guilty of more heinous sins. It is a great curse for a
   man to be left to his own ways: Hosea iv. 17, Let him alone;' so Ps.
   lxxxi. 12, I gave them up to their own hearts' lust.' Men must needs
   perish when left to themselves, without this wholesome, profitable
   discipline of the cross.

   2. It is good, because the evil in it is counterpoised by a more
   abundant good. It is evil as it doth deprive us of our natural
   comforts, pleasure, gain, honour; but it is good as these may be
   recompensed with better pleasures, richer gain, and greater honour.
   There is more pleasure in holiness than there can be pain and trouble
   in affliction: Heb. xii. 11, No affliction for the present seemeth
   joyous, but grievous, but afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness.' More gain than affliction can bring loss: Heb. xii. 10,
   But he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.'
   More honour than affliction can bring shame, surely then it is good.
   There is a threefold profit we get by affliction: --

   [1.] The time of affliction is a serious thinking time: Eccles. vii.
   14, In the day of adversity consider:' 1 Kings viii. 47, Yet if they
   bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive.' We
   have more liberty to retire into ourselves, being freed from the
   attractive allurements of worldly vanities and the delights of the
   flesh. Adversity maketh men serious; the prodigal came to himself when
   he began to be in want, Luke xv. 17. Sad objects make a deep impression
   upon our souls; they help us to consider our own ways and God's
   righteous dealings, that we may behave ourselves wisely and suitably to
   the dispensation: Micah vi. 9, The man of wisdom will hear the rod.'

   [2.] It is a special hearing time; in the text, That I might learn thy
   statutes:' and it is said of Christ, Heb. v. 8, that He learned
   obedience from the things that he suffered:' he did experimentally
   understand what obedience was in hard and difficult cases, and so could
   the better pity poor sinners in affliction: we have an experimental
   knowledge of that of which we had but a notional knowledge before. We
   come by experience to see how false and changeable the world is, how
   comfortable an interest in God is, what a burden sin is, what sweetness
   there is in the promises, what a reality in the word. Luther said, Qui
   tribulantur, &c. The afflicted see more in the scripture than others
   do; the secure and fortunate read them as they do Ovid's verses.
   Certainly when the soul is humble, and when we are refined and raised
   above the degrees of sense, we are more tractable and teachable, our
   understandings are clearer, our affections more melting. Our spiritual
   learning is a blessing that cannot be valued. If God write his law upon
   our hearts by his stripes on our backs, so light a trouble should not
   be grudged at

   [3.] It is an awakening, quickening time.

   (1.) Some are awakened out of the sleep of death, and are first wrought
   upon by afflictions. This is one powerful means to bring in souls to
   God, and to open their ears to discipline. God began with them in their
   afflictions, and the time of their sorrows was the time of loves. The
   hot furnace is Christ's workhouse, the most excellent vessels of honour
   and praise have been formed there: Isa. xlviii. 10, I have chosen thee
   in the furnace of affliction.' Manasses, Paul, the jailer, were all
   chosen in the fire; God puts them into the furnace, and chooseth them
   there, melts them, and stamps them with the image of Christ. The hog's
   trough was a good school to the prodigal. Well, then, doth God do you
   any harm by affliction when he saves you by it? If we use violence to a
   man that is ready to be drowned, and in pulling him out of the waters
   should break an arm or a leg, would he not be thankful? If you have
   broken my arm, you have saved my life. So God's children: It is good
   that I had such an affliction, felt the sharpness of such a cross. Oh,
   blessed providence! I had been a witless fool, and gone on still in a
   course of sin and vanity, if God had not awakened me.

   (2.) It quickeneth others to be more careful of their duty, more
   watchful against sin, and doth exercise and improve us in heavenly
   virtues and graces of spirit, which lay dormant in us through neglect,
   since pleasing objects, which deaden the heart, are removed. Even God's
   best children, when they have gotten a carnal pillow under their heads,
   are apt to sleep; their prayers are dead; thoughts of heaven cold, or
   none; little zeal for God or delight in him: Isa. xxvi. 16, Lord, in
   trouble they have visited thee; they pour out a prayer when thy
   chastening is upon them;' Hosea v. 15, In their afflictions they will
   seek me early.' Because they do not stir up themselves, God stirreth
   them up by a smart rod. The husbandman pruneth the vine, lest it run
   out into leaves; the baits of the flesh must be taken from us, that our
   gust and relish of heavenly things may be recovered.

   Use 1. The use is to caution us against our murmurings and taxing of
   God's providence. How few are there that give him thanks for his
   seasonable discipline, and observe God's faithfulness and the benefit
   they have by afflictions, but rather murmur, repine, and fret through
   impatience! If it be good to be afflicted, let us accept of it, for
   good is matter of choice: Lev. xxvi. 41, If their uncircumcised hearts
   be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity.'
   Now all affliction on this side hell is good, as it is a lesser evil;
   hic ure, hic seca, if God will cut here, burn here, lance here, as a
   chirurgeon, that we may not be destroyed for ever; corrected, that we
   may not be condemned, 1 Cor. xi. 32. It is good, as it is a means to
   good; for the end putteth a loveliness also upon the means, though
   things in themselves be harsh and sour. We must not consider what
   things are in themselves, but what they are in their reduction,
   tendency, and final use. So all things are yours, crosses, deaths, 1
   Cor. iii. 18; all their crosses, yea, sometimes their sins and snares,
   by God's overruling. We lose the benefit of our affliction by our
   murmurings, repinings, faintings, carnal sorrows and fears; an
   impatient distrustful mind spoileth the working of God: Tribulation
   worketh patience, and patience experience.' It is not the bare
   affliction worketh, but the affliction meekly borne. Let us not
   misconstrue God's present way of dealing with us. There may be a
   seeming harshness in some of his dealings, but yet, all things
   considered, you will find them full of mercy and truth. Murmuring is a
   disorder in the affections, misinterpreting in the understanding, to
   prevent it.

   1. Consider you must not interpret the covenant by God's providence,
   but God's providence by his covenant. Certain it is that all new
   covenant dispensations are mercy and truth, Ps. xxv. 10, our crosses
   not excepted; by them God is pursuing his covenant and eternal purpose
   concerning our salvation. There is sometimes a seeming contradiction
   between his promises and his providences, word and works; his voice is
   sweet like Jacob's, but his hand rough like Esau's. Go unto the
   sanctuary, and God will help you to reconcile things, Ps. lxxiii. 16,
   17; otherwise the difficulty will be too hard for you. The children of
   God, that have suspected or displeased him, have always found
   themselves in error, Isa. xlix. 14, 15. His promise is the light side,
   his providence the dark side of the cloud: Ps. lxxvii. 19, Thy way is
   in the sea, and thy path in the deep waters, and thy footsteps are not
   known.' We cannot trace him, nor find out the reason of everything that
   God doeth; only, in the general, that he doeth all things well,' Mark
   vii. 37; nay, what is best.

   2. We must distinguish between a part of God's work and the end of it.
   We cannot understand God's providence till he hath done his work. He is
   an impatient spectator that cannot tarry till the last act, wherein all
   errors are reconciled: John xiii. 7, What I do thou knowest not now,
   but hereafter thou shalt know.' No wonder if we are much in the dark,
   if we look only to present sense and present appearance. Then his
   purposes are hidden from us; he bringeth one contrary out of another,
   light out of darkness, meat out of the eater. God knoweth what he is
   a-doing with you, when you know not: Jer. xxix. 11, I know my thoughts,
   to give you an expected end.' When we view providences by pieces, we
   know not God's mind; for the present we see him (it may be) rending and
   tearing all things; therefore let us not judge of God's work by the
   beginnings, till all work together. Our present state may be very sad
   and uncomfortable, and yet God is designing the choicest mercies to us:
   Ps. xxxi. 22, 1 said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes;
   nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
   unto thee;' Ps. cxvi. 11, I said in my haste, All men are liars.' Haste
   never speaketh well of God nor his promises, nor maketh any good
   comment upon his dealings.

   3. We must distinguish between that which is really best for us, and
   what we judge best for us: Deut. viii. 15, 16, Who led thee through
   that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and
   scorpions and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee out
   water out of the rock of flint; who fed thee in the wilderness with
   manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that
   he might prove thee, to do thee good at the latter end.' Other diet is
   more wholesome for our souls than that which our sick appetite craveth.
   It is best with us many times when we are weakest: 2 Cor. xii. 10, When
   I am weak, then am I strong.' Worst when strongest: 2 Chron. xxvi. 16,
   When he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his own destruction.'
   Lot chose Sodom, a fair and pleasant situation, but you know what
   inconveniences he met with there. Many times the buffetings of Satan
   are better for us than a condition free from temptation; so is poverty,
   emptiness, better than fulness, loss of friends than enjoyment of them.

   Use 2. For information.

   1. By what note we may know whether God chastens us in anger, yea or
   nay; whether our crosses be curses. The cross that maketh thee better
   cometh with a blessing. It is not the sharpness of the affliction we
   should look to, but the improvement of it. The bitter waters may be
   made sweet by experiences of grace; if we are made more godly, wise,
   religious, it is a good cross; but if it leave us as careless and
   stupid, or no better than we were before, that cross is but a
   preparation to another; if it hath only stirred up our impatience, done
   us no good, God will follow his stroke, and heat his furnace hotter.

   2. It informeth us that it is our duty not only to be good in
   afflictions, but we must be good after afflictions. David, when
   escaped, saith, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.' Wicked
   men are somewhat good in afflictions, but as soon as they are delivered
   they return to their old sins; as metals are melted while they are in
   the furnace, but when they are taken out, they return to their natural
   hardness; but the godly are better afterwards.

   3. That every condition is as the heart is. Afflictions are good if we
   have the grace to make a good use of them. Look, as the good blessings
   of God by our corruption are abused to wantonness, and so made hurtful
   to us, so crosses, that are evil in themselves, when sanctified are
   good. All things are sanctified to us when we are sanctified to God.
   Other things that would be snares prove helps and encouragements, are
   great furtherances. The creature is another thing to the saints; if
   they are advanced, their hearts are enlarged to God; if afflicted, they
   grow more humble, watchful, serious. All things work together for the
   worst to the wicked. If God make Saul a king, Judas an apostle, Balaam
   a prophet, their preferment shall be their ruin. Hainan's honour,
   Ahithophel's wit, and Herod's applause turned to their hurt--if in
   prosperity, they contemn God; if in adversity, deny and blaspheme him:
   Prov. i. 32, For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and
   the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.' As the salt sea turneth
   all into salt water, so a man is in the constitution of his soul; all
   things are converted to that use.

   Use 3. To persuade us to make this acknowledgment, that affliction is
   good. There needs many graces before we can thus determine.

   1. Faith. It is not present, but it must be believed, hoped, and waited
   for. It is not fit all should be done in a day, and as early as we
   would; in the Lord's time the fruit will appear. The word doth not work
   by and by, so not the rod. Faith can see good in that in which sense
   only can find smart: Phil. i. 19, I know this shall turn to my
   salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the spirit of Jesus
   Christ:' and We know that all things shall work together for good,'
   Rom. viii. 28. Though it doth not appear, yet we know.

   2. Love. The children of God, out of their love to God and present
   submission to God, do count whatsoever he doth to be good: Ps. lxxiii.
   1, Yet God is good to Israel.' Though he seemeth to deal with his
   people hardly, yet love pronounceth the dispensation to be good; it can
   see a great deal of love in pain, and smart, and chastenings. I have
   read once and again of such a rabbi, that, when told of an affliction,
   would say, This is good, because it cometh from God.

   3. Spiritual wisdom and choice to esteem things according to their
   intrinsic worth. A high value of holiness, profiting in sanctification,
   is more than enough to recompense all the trouble we are put to in
   learning it. This will make us yield to be lessened in our worldly
   comforts for the increase of spiritual grace: as Paul would cheerfully
   part with his health that he might have more experience of Christ: 2
   Cor. xii. 10, I will take pleasure in infirmities, necessities, and
   distresses, for Christ's sake.' Surely the loss of outward things
   should trouble us the less, and we should be the sooner satisfied in
   God's dispensation, if he will take away our earthly comforts, and make
   us more mindful of that which is heavenly; if by an aching head God
   will give you a better heart, by the death of friends promote the life
   of grace.

   4. Diligence and needfulness--(1.) To observe afflictions; (2.) To
   improve them.

   [1.] To observe what falleth out, from what hand it cometh, to what
   issue it tendeth; otherwise, if we observe it not, how can we
   acknowledge it, give God the glory of his wisdom and goodness? In
   heaven, when we shall know as we are known, it will be a great part of
   our lauding of God to look back on his providence conducting us through
   troubles, as it is pleasant for travellers in their inn to discourse of
   the deepness and danger of the ways. And now, when we rather are known
   than know, Gal. iv. 9, it is useful and comfortable to take notice of
   God's dealing with us. Oh, what a deal of wisdom, faithfulness, and
   truth may we see in the conduct of his providence! Gen. xxxii. 10, I am
   not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of all the truth which
   thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this
   Jordan, and now I am become two bands;' Ps. cxix. 75, I know, O Lord,
   that thy judgments are right, and that in faithfulness thou hast
   afflicted me.' What necessity of his chastisement to prevent our pride,
   security, negligence! with what wisdom was our cross chosen! how did
   God strike in the right vein! you were running on apace in some neglect
   of God till he awakened you. This observation will help us to love God,
   who is vigilant and careful of our welfare. It will allay all the hard
   thoughts that we have of the seeming severity of his dispensations.

   [2.] Diligence to improve it for the bringing about of this good. We
   must not be idle spectators, but active under God; we must more stir up
   ourselves, and exercise ourselves to godliness. The affliction of
   itself is a dead thing; there must be help: Phil. i. 19, For I know
   this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of
   the spirit of Jesus Christ;' 2 Cor. i. 11, Ye also helping together by
   prayer for us.' It is not the nature of the cross, nor the power of
   inherent grace, without the actual influence of the Spirit, that makes
   troubles profitable. We must excite ourselves also, for the saints are
   not only passive objects, but active instruments of providence. We are
   not merely to be passive: Heb. xii. 11, It yieldeth the pleasant fruit
   of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.' God exerciseth us
   with the rod, and we must exercise ourselves under the rod. We are
   engaged to use all holy means to this end, searching, praying, rousing
   up ourselves, learning our proper lessons; then we will come and make
   our acknowledgment, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.'

SERMON LXXX.

   The law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and
   silver.--Ver. 72.

   THESE words may be conceived as a reason of what was said in the
   foregoing verse. David hath told us there that it was good for him that
   he was afflicted, because of the benefit obtained by his afflictions;
   he had learned God's statutes, knew more of his duty, and had a heart
   to keep closer to it. Now this gain was more to him than his loss by
   affliction; for he doth not value his happiness by his temporal
   interests so much as by his thriving in godliness. All the wealth in
   the world was not so much to him as the spiritual benefit which he got
   by his sore troubles; for the law of thy mouth,' &c.

   The text is a profession of his respect to the word, a profession which
   containeth in it the very spirit of godliness, a speech that becometh
   only such a man's mouth as David was, one that is sincerely godly. Many
   will be ready to make this profession, but other things do not suit;
   the profession of their mouths is contradicted by the disposition of
   their hearts, and the course and tenor of their lives. Observe here two
   things:--

   1. The things compared.

   2. The value and preference of the one above the other.

   [1.] The things compared. On the one side there is the law of God's
   mouth; on the other, thousands of gold and silver.

   [2.] The value and preference of the one above the other, it is better
   to me, it is better in itself. There was reason for his esteem and
   choice. Many will say it is better in itself, but David saith it is
   better to me. Let us explain these circumstances as they are laid.

   [1.] The things compared.

   (1.) On the one side there is the law of God's mouth:' it is God's own
   word, and we should be as sure of it as if we had heard him utter and
   pronounce it with his own mouth, or had received it immediately by
   oracle from him. And indeed that is one way to raise this esteem: 1
   Thes. ii. 13, Receiving it not as the word of men, but, as it is in
   truth, the word of God, which worketh effectually in you that believe.'
   In the word we must consider two things--the authority of it, and the
   ministry of it. If we consider the authority of it, so it cometh from
   God's mouth; if we consider the ministry of it, so it cometh by man's
   mouth, for he speaketh to us by men: 2 Peter i. 21, Holy men spake as
   they were moved by the Holy Ghost.' If we look to the ministry only,
   and not to the authority, we are in danger to slight it; certainly
   shall not profit by it. Many do so, as Samuel thought Eli called him,
   when it was the Lord, 1 Sam. iii. 7, 8; but when we consider who is the
   author of it, then it calleth for our reverence and regard.

   (2.) On the other side, thousands of gold and silver.' Where wealth is
   set out--(1.) By the species and kind of it--gold and silver; gold for
   hoarding and portage, silver for present commerce. (2.) The quantity,
   thousands,' that is, thousands of pieces, as that addition is used, Ps.
   lxviii. 30, They shall submit themselves with pieces of silver,' or
   talents, as the Chaldee paraphrase expoundeth it. Money answereth all
   things,' Eccles. x. 19. It can command all things in the world, as the
   great instrument of commerce.

   [2.] The value and preference of the one above the other, it is
   better,' and it is better to me.' It is better in itself, that noteth
   the intrinsic worth of the word; it is better to me, that implieth his
   own esteem and choice. To say, in the general only, It is better,
   implieth but a speculative approbation, which may be in carnal men:
   Rom. ii. 18, And approvest the things that are more excellent:' but to
   say, It is better to me, implieth a practical esteem, which is proper
   only to the regenerate. It is more dear, precious, and sweet to them
   than the greatest treasure. Could we have such a holy affection to the
   word, and say also, To me, and to me, we should thrive more in a course
   of godliness; for a man is carried on powerfully by his choice and
   esteem, his actions are governed and determined by it.

   Doct. The word of God is dearer to a gracious heart than all the riches
   in the world.

   Let me bring proofs: Ps. xix. 10, More to be desired are they than
   gold, yea, than much fine gold.' So speaking of spiritual wisdom, which
   is only to be had by the word of God, he saith, Prov. iii. 14, That the
   merchandise thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and the
   gain thereof than fine gold.' So Prov. viii. 11, For wisdom is better
   than rubies, and all the things which are to be desired are not to be
   compared with it.' These expressions are frequently used, because the
   greatest part of mankind are miserably bewitched with the desire of
   riches; but God's children are otherwise affected, they have a better
   treasure.

   Let me prove two things:--

   1. That the word of God, and the benefit we get by it, is better than
   thousands of gold and silver.

   2. That the children of God do so esteem it. Both must be proved; the
   one to show the worth and excellency of the word, the other to show the
   gracious disposition of the hearts of God's children. There is no
   question but that if these things were well weighed, the law of God's
   mouth, and thousands of gold and silver, we should find there is a
   great inequality between them; but all men have not a judgment to
   choose that which is most worthy. Many take glass beads for jewels, and
   prefer toys and trifles before a solid good. Gold and silver draw the
   hearts of all men to them, and their affections blind their judgment;
   and then, though the weights be equal, if the balances be not equal,
   wrong will be done. We do not weigh things with an equal balance, but
   consider them with a prejudiced mind, and a heart biassed and
   prepossessed with worldly inclinations.

   First, then, for the things themselves; surely gold and silver, which
   is digged out of the bowels of the earth, is not worthy to be compared
   with the law that cometh out of the mouth of God. If you compare the
   nature, use, and duration of these benefits that you have by the one
   and the other, you will see a vast difference.

   1. The nature. The notion of riches is abundance of valuable things.
   Now there are true riches and counterfeit riches, which have but the
   resemblance and show. The true riches is spoken of Luke xvi. 11, and is
   opposed to that mammon and pelf which the world doteth upon. Grace
   giveth us the true riches and wealth. It is good to state what are the
   true riches and the false. The more abundance of truly valuable things
   a man hath, the more he hath of true riches. A child counteth himself
   rich when he hath a great many pins and points and cherry-stones, for
   those suit his childish age and fancy. A worldly man counteth himself
   rich when he hath gold and silver in great store by him, or lands and
   heritages, or bills and bonds; but a child of God counteth himself rich
   when he hath God for his portion, Christ to his redeemer, and the
   Spirit for his guide, sanctifier, and comforter; which is as much above
   a carnal man's estate in the world as a carnal man's estate is above a
   child's toys and trifles, yea, in finitely more. Well, then, surely the
   word of God will make us rich, because it revealeth God to be our God,
   according to our necessity and capacity: Ps. xvi. 5, 6, The Lord is my
   portion: I have a goodly heritage;' and it revealeth unsearchable
   riches of grace in Christ, Eph, ii. 1, iii. 8, pardon of sins, and life
   eternal. They that have Christ want nothing, but are completely happy.
   So for the Spirit; what are all the riches of the world to those
   treasures of knowledge, comfort, and holiness which we have by the
   Spirit! What is in one evangelist, He will give his Holy Spirit to them
   that ask him,' Luke xi. 13, is in another, Mat. vii. 11, He will give
   good things to them that ask him.' The Spirit is instead of all good
   things, so that the word is able to enrich a man more than all the
   wealth of the world can. It giveth us abundance, and abundance of
   better things; so that a man is not absolutely poor that wants gold and
   silver, but he that wants the benefits which the word of God offereth
   and conveyeth to us. Gold and silver are but one sort of riches, and
   but the lowest and meanest sort You do not count a man poor if he have
   lands, though he hath not ready-money; much less is a man poor if he
   hath gold, though he hath not silver. So a Christian is not poor if he
   hath God and Christ and the Spirit, though he say, with the apostle
   Peter, Silver and gold have I none,' Acts iii. 6. Angels are not poor
   though they have not flocks and herds and yearly revenues; they have an
   excellency suitable to their natures. So a Christian is not poor while
   he possesseth him who possesseth all things. But that I may not seem
   only to say that the treasures of grace are the true riches, I shall
   prove it by two arguments:--

   [1.] That is the true riches which can buy and purchase all other
   things, but all other things cannot buy and purchase it. Now all the
   riches in the world cannot buy and purchase those benefits which the
   word offereth to us. They cannot purchase the favour of God; For what
   hope hath the hypocrite, if he hath gained, when God comes to take away
   his soul?' Job xvii. 8. Many a carnal wretch doth not make a saving
   bargain of it; but be it so, he looketh for worldly gain and hath it.
   What will this stead him when God puts the bond of the old covenant in
   suit, and demandeth his soul from him? He is loath to resign it, but
   God will have it: What can he give in exchange for his soul?' Money
   cannot purchase the grace of the Redeemer: 1 Peter i. 18, Ye are not
   redeemed with corruptible things;' and Ps. xlix. 6-8, The redemption of
   the soul is precious.' Men would, if they could, give a thousand worlds
   for the pardon of their sin, when they come to receive the fruit of it;
   but all will not do: the wrath of God must be appeased, and the justice
   of God satisfied, by another kind of ransom. They cannot purchase the
   grace of the Spirit. Simon Magus would give money for the gifts of the
   Holy Ghost, but Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because
   thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money,'
   Acts viii. 20. His request was base and carnal; yet thus far it
   yieldeth a testimony to the truth in hand, that he thought the gift of
   the Holy Ghost better than money, or else he would not have offered his
   money for it; yea, the lowest and far less necessary gift than his
   sanctifying, guiding, and comforting work. Well, then, all other things
   cannot purchase these benefits. But, on the other side, these benefits
   procure all other things. Grace giveth us an advantage in worldly
   things above others, for certainly Man doth not live by bread only,'
   Mat. iv., and his life doth not lie in worldly abundance: the natural,
   much more the sanctified and comfortable, use of the creatures
   dependeth on the favour of God and his fatherly care and providence,
   which is assured to the heirs of promise: Mat. vi. 33, First seek the
   kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these things shall be added;'
   1 Tim. iv. 8, Godliness hath the promise of this life and that which is
   to come;' Prov. iii. 15, 16, Wealth is not to be compared with wisdom;
   because in her right hand is length of days, and in her left hand
   riches and honour.' A child of God that is obedient to the word hath
   more advantage for the world than a wicked man hath: he hath a promise
   which the other hath not, a warrant to cast his care upon God; he gets
   more by the want of worldly things than a wicked man by the possession
   of them, for his want is sanctified, and worketh for good.

   [2.] The world cannot recompense and supply the want of that grace we
   get by the word, but this can easily supply the want of the world. The
   worth and value of things is known by this, what we can least want. Now
   there is no earthly thing but may be so supplied as that its want
   should be better to us than its enjoyment. Sickness may be better to us
   than health, because of experiences of grace, 2 Cor. xii. 10. Poverty
   may be better than wealth, because we may be rich in grace, James i. 9;
   so James ii. 5; so 1 Tim. vi. 6, Godliness with contentment is great
   gain.' Slender provision with a contented heart is much better than a
   great deal more wealth. Godliness can supply the room of wealth, but
   wealth cannot supply the room of godliness. If the want of wealth helps
   us to an increase of grace and communion with God, it helpeth us to
   that which is of higher and greater value than the enjoyment of wealth
   could afford. But now, on the other side, the world will not give us a
   recompense for the want of godliness: Mat. xvi. 26, What is a man
   profited if he shall gain the world and lose his soul?' What shall be
   given to the party for that loss? His soul is lost, not in a natural
   sense, but in a legal sense, forfeited to God's justice. We may please
   ourselves in our carnal choice for a while, but death bloweth away all
   our vain conceits: Jer. xvii. 11, At his latter end he shall be a
   fool.' He was a fool before all his lifetime, but now in the judgment
   and conviction of his own conscience. His conscience shall rave at him,
   fool, madman I to hazard the love of Christ for worldly things. These
   things cannot be recompensed by any other. What poor rewards can the
   world yield you for the loss of Christ and heaven! Alas! then, you lose
   your treasure, and have nothing to comfort you but rattles and baubles,
   which will no more comfort us than fine flowers will a man going to
   execution. Thus in the nature of riches.

   2. Let us come to the use and end of these things, the use of the law
   of God's mouth, and the use of wealth. The use of wealth is to support
   and maintain the present life and the bodily state during our
   pilgrimage and passage through the world; but the use of the word is to
   guide and direct us in the way to the blessedness of the world to come.
   The world supplieth our bodily necessities; But the law of God is
   perfect, converting the soul,' Ps. xix. 7. It discovereth a man's
   soul-misery and remedy, as it directeth to Christ, and enforceth our
   obedience to God, and prescribeth a universal adherence to him and
   dependence on him. Our souls are fallen off from God by sin into a most
   doleful state, and have no other way of recovery than is prescribed in
   this blessed word of God. There are three uses of the word of God, and
   they do all commend and endear it to our respects:--

   [1.] It is the great means to sanctify and convey a divine principle
   and nature in us; it is not only the rule, but the seed of the new
   life: 1 Peter i. 23, He hath begotten us, not by corruptible, but
   incorruptible seed,' &c.; James i. 18, He hath begotten us by the word
   of truth;' 2 Peter i. 4, To us are given great and precious promises,
   that we might be made partakers of the divine nature;' John xvii. 17,
   Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.' All this is said
   of the word: it is the means to sanctify us, the immortal seed, the
   beginning of the new life, the divine nature to make us live after a
   godlike manner; therefore it is better than thousands of gold and
   silver.' A child of God findeth a greater treasure in one chapter of
   the Bible than worldly men in all their lands and honours and large
   revenues. A poor Christian meeteth with more true gain in a sermon than
   others can in their trades while they live. God begetteth him at first
   by the word of truth, and giveth him there the supply of the Spirit;
   therefore be swift to hear,' much in reading, and meditation day and
   night. Oh! there is the true treasure, the pearl of price; there their
   souls become acquainted with God.

   [2.] It directeth us and keepeth us from being carried away with every
   deceit of sin: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a light unto my path, and a
   lamp unto my feet.' Here are directions for all cases: here is a
   general direction, it is a light to our path; and showeth us what to do
   in particular actions, it is a lamp to our feet. So ver. 133, Order my
   steps in thy word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me.' It is
   the word prevents the reign of any one sin. To have a sure rule to walk
   by in the midst of so many snares and temptations is a greater favour
   than to enjoy the greatest affluence of worldly felicity.

   [3.] It supporteth us in all our afflictions and extremities. All the
   wealth in the world composed and put together cannot yield us that true
   contentment and satisfaction which the word of God doth to the obedient
   soul. Wealth cannot allay a grieved mind nor appease a wounded
   conscience. The word directeth us where we may find rest for our souls:
   Jer. vi. 16, Go ask for the good old way, and you shall find rest for
   your souls.' We lose ourselves in a maze of uncertainties till we come
   to the word of God: Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all ye that are weary
   and heavy laden, and ye shall find rest for your souls.' Here is ease
   for the great wound and maim of nature. The great maim of nature is
   sin. Now where shall we have a plaster for this sore, but only in the
   word of God? So for particular afflictions: Rom. xv. 4, That ye,
   through the patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.'
   Comfort is the strengthening of the mind, or the fortifying the mind
   when it is vexed and weakened with doubts, fears, and sorrows: I had
   fainted in my affliction unless thy word had quickened me,' Ps. cxix.
   50. The comforts of the world appear and vanish in a moment, cannot
   firmly stay and revive the heart; every blast of temptation scattereth
   them. Philosophy and natural reason cannot give us true ground of
   comfort: that was it they aimed at, how to fortify the soul and keep it
   quiet notwithstanding troubles in the flesh; but as they never
   understood the true ground of misery, which is sin, so neither the true
   ground of comfort, which is Christ. That which man offereth cannot come
   with such power and authority upon the conscience as that which God
   offereth, and bare reason cannot have such an efficacy as divine
   testimony and the law of God's mouth. This moonlight rotteth before it
   ripeneth fruits; but the word acquainteth us with Christ, who is the
   foundation of comfort; with the Spirit, who is the efficient cause of
   comfort; with the promise of heaven, which is the true matter of
   comfort; with faith, the great instrument to receive it.

   3. Let us look to the duration. There is a vanity and uncertainty in
   all these outward things; they soon take the wing, and leave us in
   sorrow. If they continue with us till death, then they have done all
   their work. Wealth may bring you to the grave, but it can stead you no
   further; then wealth is gone, but horror doth continue: Luke xvi. 24,
   Son, in thy lifetime thou enjoyedst thy good things.' These good things
   are only commensurate with life. Sometimes they do not last so long;
   but when we must leave the world, and launch out to those unknown
   regions, Job xxvii. 8, how miserable shall we be! Worldly comforts will
   fail us when we have most need of them, as Jonah's gourd when the sun
   scorched him. So in the hour of death, what will bags of gold do then?
   But now, on the other side, wisdom is better than gold and silver,
   because with her are durable riches and righteousness,' Prov. viii. 18,
   19; therefore my fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold, and my
   revenue than choice silver.' If a man would labour for anything, labour
   for that which is eternal, John vi. 27. No treasure can be compared to
   eternal life, and this the word assureth us of.

   Secondly, Let us now come to examine why the children of God value it
   so.

   1. Because they are enlightened by the Spirit, when others have their
   eyes dazzled with external splendour, and their judgment corrupted by
   their senses. It is not ignorance undoes the world so much as want of
   spiritual prudence. Spiritual and heavenly things can only be seen in
   the light of the Spirit, without which we can neither discern the truth
   or worth of them in order to choice: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit:' and therefore, till we have
   this illuminating and sanctifying light of the Spirit, we shall not
   make a good choice for ourselves. Eph. i. 17, 18, the apostle prayeth,
   That the Lord would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation; the
   eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is
   the hope of his calling, and the riches of the glory of his inheritance
   in the saints.' That saving knowledge of divine mysteries which causeth
   us to prefer and choose them above other things comes from the Spirit
   of wisdom and revelation; otherwise, in seeing we see not. There is a
   perfect contradiction many times between speculative and practical
   knowledge. The common wisdom and knowledge of divine mysteries is a
   gift that cometh from the Spirit, much more the spiritual discerning.

   2. They are affected with their true necessities. Our real necessities
   are the necessities of the soul. Bodily wants are more urging and
   pressing upon us, but these are more dangerous; therefore gold and
   silver, which supplieth our bodily necessities, is not so welcome to
   them as the law of God's mouth, which provideth a remedy for their
   soul-defects. How to be justified, how sanctified, is more than what
   shall we eat and drink, and wherewith shall we be clothed. Usually
   soul-necessities are overlooked; we regard them not, or conceit we are
   well already: Rev. iii. 17, Thou thoughtest thou wast rich, and
   increased with goods, and hadst need of nothing:' and then we have no
   relish for the offered remedy. The word of God is the offered remedy to
   repair our collapsed state. The gospel is not only true, but worthy to
   be embraced, 1 Tim. i. 15; but who will embrace it but the sensible
   sinner? for it is offered as a remedy to the sick and deliverance to
   the captive: it is not enough to see the excellency of things, but we
   must see our necessity of them. There are two hindrances that prejudice
   our salvation--either the necessity and excellency of the gospel is not
   considered, or the truth and reality of it is not believed.

   3. They measure all things with respect not to this world but the world
   to come. It is a high point of religion to do all things and regard all
   things for eternal ends: 2 Cor. iv. 18, Looking not to things seen,
   that are temporal, but to the things which are not seen, which are
   eternal:' making this our scope, and doing all to this end. Gold and
   silver are the most valuable things in the world: what cannot gold and
   silver buy in this world? But there is another world, and believers
   look to things unseen. Within a while it will not be a pin to choose
   whether we have enjoyed much or little of this world's good things; but
   much will lie upon this, whether we have obeyed God, and glorified God,
   and accepted of Christ. The use of gold and silver ceaseth in the world
   to come: these things are not current in Canaan, nor accounted of in
   our heavenly country; therefore money should be a vile thing instead of
   grace. We can carry away none of these things with us when we die,
   Eccles. v. 15; and surely that which hath no power to free us from
   death, to comfort us in death, or go with us into another world after
   death, is no happiness or solid tranquillity.

   4. They have had trial and experience of the word, what a comfort and
   support it hath been to them: 1 Peter ii. 2, 3, As new-born babes
   desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be
   ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' There is an appetite
   followeth the new nature, and makes us desire spiritual food: Phil. i.
   9, 10, And this I pray, that ye may abound in all knowledge and in all
   judgment, that ye may approve the things that are excellent.' When the
   Spirit giveth us a taste of the goodness of those things offered in the
   word of God, a taste of divine truth in our souls, when we find these
   comforts verified in us, then we come to approve the things that are
   excellent above all other things: Ps. cxix. 11, Thy word have I hid in
   my heart, that I might not sin against thee.' We never know the worth
   of the word till we come to make trial of it by practice and
   experience. The pleasure of the word we find in practice, and the
   comfort and support of it in deep afflictions. It is not so with the
   world; try it, and loathe it; it is more in fancy than fruition,
   because the imperfections which formerly lay hid are discovered; but
   the more intimately acquainted with the word of God, the more we prize
   it; we see there is more to be gained there than in all the world
   besides.

   Use 1. To reprove and disprove those that prefer gold and silver before
   the word of God. This is done by four sorts:--

   1. This is grossly done by those that revolt from the profession of the
   truth for the world's sake: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, and
   embraced the present world:' that betray the cause of religion, as
   Judas sold his master for thirty pieces of silver; or by those who will
   transgress for a small hire. The devil needeth not offer great things
   to them, when they will accept of less with thanks; for two pence or
   three pence gain will profane the Sabbath or wrong their neighbour. Is
   the law of God's mouth dearer to them than gold and silver? Surely no.
   They may flatter themselves with love to the word, but when they can
   violate it for a trifle, for a pair of shoes, it is a sign that a
   little gain gotten by iniquity of traffic is sweeter to them than all
   the comforts of the promise.

   2. It is done by them that will not forsake anything for the word's
   sake but when they are put upon an apparent trial. Here is gold and
   silver, and there the law of God's mouth; what will you do? obey God,
   or comply with your interests? You show your love by leaving the one
   rather than the other; as Moses counted the reproach of Christ better
   treasure than the riches of Egypt,' Heb. xi. 26. Christ's worst is
   better than the world's best. The Thessalonians showed their love when
   they received the word in much affliction; but when you decline duty,
   and are loath to hazard your interests, it is evident what you prefer.
   To some this may be a daily temptation: If I should be conscionable in
   my calling, I should be poor; keep touch and honesty in all things, it
   would turn to my loss. How many are discouraged from the ways of God,
   and discharging a good conscience, by inconveniency!

   3. This is also in part done by them who turn back upon the word and
   ordinances of God for gain's sake, and fix their residence there, where
   they can neither enjoy God nor his people, nor the comfort of his
   ordinances; as merchants who remove for traffic, and settle their abode
   there where the true religion is not professed, it may be, suppressed
   with extreme rigour; especially when they send youth thither, and
   novices and persons not grounded in the faith. This is like turning a
   child loose among a company of contagious persons, or setting an empty
   pitcher to crack before the fire. Commerce and traffic with infidels or
   persons of a false religion is lawful; but to make our constant
   residence where there is no liberty for reading and hearing the word of
   God, no liberty of worship and ordinances, cannot be excused from sin.
   You make religion to stoop to gain. I will not urge so high and
   heroical an instance as Moses: Heb. xi. 25, Choosing rather to suffer
   afflictions with the people of God, than enjoy the pleasures of sin for
   a season;' but of a Jew since the time of their degeneration. I have
   once and again read of one Rabbi Joseph, who, being allured with the
   hope and call to a place of great gain, to teach Hebrew where there was
   no synagogue, is said to have brought forth this scripture for his
   answer and excuse, The law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands
   of gold and silver.' Let us Christians remember it, and consider the
   pertinency of it

   4. It is more refinedly done by them who by earthly things are drawn
   off from the pursuit of heavenly, and are night and day cumbered with
   much serving, and never take time to refresh their souls with the
   pleasure of the word; like Martha, cumbered about many things, while
   Mary sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word, Luke x. Felix domus, saith
   Bernard, ubi Martha queritur de Maria--it is a happy house where Martha
   complaineth of Mary. But alas! in most places it is otherwise; religion
   is encroached upon, all remembrance of God and meditation of his word
   is jostled out of doors by the cares of the world.

   Use 2. To press us to make this profession seriously, heartily.

   1. When we have wealth this profession should be made to draw off the
   heart from it to better things. When our store is increased, our hearts
   are apt to be enchanted with the love of these things: Ps. lxii. 10, If
   riches increase, set not your hearts upon them.' Our hearts are very
   apt to be set upon the world; but we must remember this is not the true
   treasure; there are other manner of riches that we should look
   after--to be rich towards God, lest I be a carnal fool, Luke xii. 21.
   Complacency in a worldly portion is a sure sign of a worldly heart,
   more than greedy desire.

   2. When we want wealth we should make this profession to induce us to
   contentment. The good disciples had the Spirit; to Judas, as the bad
   one, he gave the purse. If you have spiritual wisdom and knowledge, you
   have that which is most excellent: James ii. 5, God hath chosen the
   poor of the world to be rich in faith.'

   3. When we lose wealth for righteousness' sake, we have that which is
   better. The knowledge of a hated truth is better than to shine with the
   oppressor: Prov. iii. 31, 32, Envy not the oppressor, nor choose any of
   his ways: for the froward is an abomination to the Lord; but his secret
   is with the righteous.' You have your losses exchanged for a greater
   good.

   Use 3. Of trial. Let us examine ourselves and see what esteem and
   account we have of the word of God. If any say that we are all ready to
   profess that we esteem the word of God more than all riches, then let
   us bring it off from words to deeds. Do you prefer obedience before
   gain? do you seek after spiritual wisdom more than gain? Prov. iv. 7,
   Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom; and with all thy
   getting, get understanding.' Is this your main business, to be wise to
   salvation? How many afflict and torment themselves to get silver and
   gold, but how few to understand and embrace God's law! How little doth
   this esteem of the word control contrary desires and affections!

SERMON LXXXI.

   Thine hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that
   I may learn thy commandments.--Ver. 73.

   IN these words we have two things:--

   1. The man of God's argument, thy hands have made me and fashioned me.

   2. His request, give me understanding to keep thy commandments.

   1. For his argument. He pleadeth as God's creature. Man is God's
   immediate workmanship, both as to his body and his soul. Some apply the
   words, Thy hands have made me,' to the creation of the soul; and the
   other words, and fashioned me,' to the creation of the body; but we
   need not be so accurate. Both imply that he was wholly the work of
   God's hand, a mere creature of his framing, and a creature exactly
   made; so made that he was also fashioned, fearfully and wonderfully
   made,' Ps. cxxxix. 14. The structure of man's body darts a reverence
   and awe of God into the consciences of beholders; and he saith in the
   15th verse, I was curiously wrought:' the Vulgar reads it
   acupictus--painted as with a needle. Man's body is a curious piece of
   embroidery, that is to be seen in the bones, veins, and arteries, that
   spread and run throughout the body; which consideration increaseth the
   argument, not only as he was God's work, but framed with a great deal
   of artifice.

   2. Here is his request, Give me understanding, that I may learn thy
   commandments.' In which he beggeth grace, that the faculty might be
   well disposed, Give me understanding;' and rightly exercised, That I
   may learn thy commandments:' that he might both know and keep his
   commandments. Surely he meaneth a saving knowledge: and therefore, when
   the work of grace is expressed by knowledge, a theoretical and notional
   knowledge is not understood, but that which is practical and operative;
   such a knowledge as doth work such a change both in the inward and
   outward man, as that mind, heart, and practice do express a conformity
   to God's law. As Jer. xxiv. 7, I will give them a heart to know me,
   that I am the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be their
   God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart:' that is, all
   the blessings of the covenant he expresseth by giving them a heart to
   know him: they shall so know me as to acknowledge me for their God, and
   carry themselves accordingly in dutiful obedience to me. I will regard
   them as their God, and they shall regard me as my people. So when it is
   said, Col. iii. 10, that the new man' is renewed in knowledge, after
   the image of him that created him,' it is meant of a saving knowledge
   or acknowledgment of God, such as doth produce a perfect conformity to
   his law in both the tables; it is such a knowledge as is set out in
   righteousness; these are parallel expressions, Eph. iv. 24 Well, then,
   this new nature David prayeth for, Give me understanding;' not as
   though he were altogether a stranger to it, but as seeking further 1
   degrees of it; such a spiritual understanding of the will of God as
   might bring him into a more perfect and entire submission there unto: I
   am thy creature:' let me be thy new creature; give me a faculty so
   clearly renewed that I may know and keep thy commandments.

   Doct. That as we are creatures, we are some way encouraged to ask of
   God the grace of the new creature.

   I shall draw forth the sense of the text and the doctrine in these
   propositions.

   1. That man was made by God, or is God's immediate workman ship. We
   have the first notice of it, Gen. i. 26, Let us make man after our own
   image and likeness.' God put more respect upon him than upon the rest
   of the work of his hands. His creation is expressed in other terms than
   were used before: He said, Let there be light, and it was light;' Let
   there be dry land,' &c. But here God speaketh as if he had called a
   consultation about it, Let us make man:' not as if there were more
   difficulty, or as if creating power were at a nonplus, but to show what
   special notice he taketh of us, and to point out the excellency which
   he did stamp upon man in his creation beyond the rest of the creatures.
   There was no creature but had some impress of God upon it, for
   everything which hath passed his hand carrieth God's signature and
   mark; it showeth that it came from a being of infinite power and wisdom
   and goodness. But man hath his image and likeness stamped upon him:
   there you may discern God's track and footprint, but here his very
   face. In his first moulding of him he would plainly and visibly
   discover himself. So again, when this making of man is explained, Gen.
   ii. 7, And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
   breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
   soul.' Before we read that man was created, here we see in what sort:
   his body was framed with great art, though of base materials; a handful
   of dust did God enliven and form into a beautiful frame. But for the
   frame within, he had a more excellent and perfect soul than God gave to
   any other creature; by the union of both these, man became a living
   soul. Heaven and earth were married in his person; the dust of the
   earth and an immortal spirit, which is called the breath of God, were
   sweetly linked and joined together, with a disposition and inclination
   to one another, the soul to the body, and the body to the soul. When he
   had raised the walls of the flesh, and built the house of the body with
   all its rooms, then he puts in a noble and divine guest to dwell in it,
   and both make up one man.

   2. The making of man now is the work of God, as well as the making of
   the first man was. God's hands did not only make and fashion Adam, but
   David. He saith, Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.' The body of
   man is of God's framing: Ps. cxxxix. 15, 16, My substance was not hid
   from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the
   lowest parts of the earth: thine eyes did see my substance, yet being
   imperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.' Our
   bodies, you see there, though the matter were propagated by our
   parents, yet his hands made them and fashioned them. God is more our
   father than our natural parents are. Our parents know not whether the
   child will be male or female, beautiful or deformed cannot tell the
   number of the bones, muscles, veins, arteries: this God appointeth and
   frameth with curious artifice; so that of all visible creatures, there
   is none in any sort equalleth man in the curious composition of the
   body, whether we look upon the beauty and majesty of his person, or
   take notice of the variety, nature, and use of his several parts, with
   their composition and framing them together, with a wonderful order and
   correspondence one to another, as if they had been described by a model
   and platform set down in a book: so secretly and curiously was the
   matter framed in passing through all the changes in the womb till it
   came to a perfect formation. Then for the soul, God infuseth that:
   Eccles. xii. 7, Then shall our dust return to the earth as it was, and
   the spirit to God that gave it.' God gave the body too, but especially
   the spirit, because there he worketh singly and immediately; therefore
   he is called the Father of spirits.' They do not run in the channel of
   carnal generation or fleshly descent, Heb. xii. 9. So Zedekiah swore by
   the God that made his soul,' Jer. xxxviii. 16. So Zech. xii. 1, He
   formed the spirit of man within him.' The parent doth instrumentally
   produce man in respect of his body, yet the soul is from God, and
   immediately created and infused into the body by him, and being put
   into that dead lump of clay, doth animate and quicken it for the most
   excellent employment.

   3. Man, that was created by God, was created to serve him: He formed us
   from the womb to be his servants,' as well as the first man, Isa. xlix.
   5. Adam indeed was appointed for this use; all other creatures were
   made to serve God, but man especially by the design of his creation:
   other things ultimately and terminatively, but man immediately and
   nextly. God made all things for himself, Prov. xvi. 4; and Rom. xi. 36,
   For of him and through him are all things; to whom be glory for ever,
   amen.' Man is the mouth of the creation. Surely it is but reason that
   God should have the use of all that he gave us; that the author of life
   and being should have some glory by them; that he should dwell in the
   house he hath set up: he that made it hath most right to use it; that
   we should glorify him with our bodies and souls, which are his,' 1 Cor.
   vi. 20. Man is designed, engaged by greater mercies, furnished with
   great abilities, as at first endowed with God's image; he hath
   faculties and capacities to know and glorify his creator. There are
   natural instincts given to other things, or inclinations to those
   things which are convenient to their own nature; but none of them are
   in a capacity to know what they are, and have, and where they are: they
   cannot frame a notion of him who gave them a being. Man is the mouth of
   the creation to speak for them: Ps. cxlv. 10, All thy works praise
   thee, O Lord, and thy saints bless thee.' He was made to love, and
   serve, and glorify God. The divine image inclined him to obedience at
   first.

   4. We are not now what God made us at first, but are strangely disabled
   to serve him and please him: Eccles. vii. 29, God made man upright, but
   they have sought out many inventions:' there is man's original and his
   degeneration; what he was once made, and how far now unmade and
   departed from his primitive estate; his perfection by creation, and
   defection by sin: first made in a state of righteousness without sin,
   and now in a state of sin and misery without grace; was created with a
   holy disposition to enable and incline him to love, please, and obey
   God, but now hath found out many inventions, put to his shifts. Man was
   not contented to be at God's finding, but would take his own course,
   and hath miserably shifted ever since to patch up a sorry happiness. So
   Rom. iii. 23, All have sinned, and are come short of the glory of God.'
   By glory of God is not meant his glorious reward, but his glorious
   image. Image is called glory, 1 Cor. xi. 7, It is said of the man, that
   he is the image and glory of God, as the woman is the glory of the
   man.' So compare 2 Cor. iii. 18, We beholding the glory of the Lord in
   a glass, &c. So here, we are come short of the glory of God,' that is,
   his glorious image. Hence it is that all our faculties are perverted,
   the mind is become blind and vain, the will stubborn and perverse,
   conscience stupid, the affections pre-occupied and entangled, and we
   find a manifest disproportion in all our faculties to things carnal and
   spiritual, sinful and holy. In the understanding there is a sharpness
   of apprehension in carnal things, but dull, slow, and blind in
   spiritual and heavenly things. Thoughts are spent freely and
   unweariedly about the one, but there is a tediousness and barrenness
   about the other; a will backward to what is good, but a strange bent
   and urging to what is evil. In that which is good we need a spur, in
   evil a bridle. These things persevere with us; but how fickle and
   changeable in any holy resolution!--the memory slippery in what is
   good, but firm and strong in what is evil; the affections quick, easily
   stirred, like tinder, catch fire at every spark; but as to that which
   is good, they are like fire in green wood, hardly kept in with much
   blowing. Again, our delight is soon moved by things pleasing to sense;
   a carnal gust and savour is very natural to us, and rife with us, Rom.
   viii. 5, but averse from the chiefest good, and everything that leadeth
   to it. Surely, then, we have need to go to God and complain of
   corruption, sometimes under the notion of a blind and dark mind,
   begging the illumination of the Spirit; some times under the notion of
   a dead, hard heart, or an unpersuadable will, begging his inclining as
   well as enlightening grace. Surely they are strangely hardened that do
   not see a need of a spiritual understanding. Nay, God's children, after
   grace received, though sanctified betimes, yet halt of the old maim,
   dull in spirituals, alive and active in carnal matters. Carnal and
   worldly men act more uniformly and suitably to their principles than
   the children of God to theirs: Luke xvi. 8, The children of this world
   are wiser in their generation than the children of light:' that is,
   more dexterous in the course of affairs. Grace for the present worketh
   but a partial cure: we have the advantage in matter of motive, we have
   better and higher things to mind; but they have the advantage in matter
   of principle; their principles are unbroken, but the principles of the
   best are mixed. We cannot do what we would in heavenly things; there is
   the back-bias of corruption that turns us away; and therefore they need
   to be instant with God to heal their souls; sometimes a blind mind, and
   sometimes a distempered heart.

   5. We must be new made and born again before we can be apt or able to
   know or do the will of God; as Christ inferreth the necessity of
   regeneration from the corruption of nature--he had been discoursing
   with Nicodemus--You cannot enter into the kingdom of God; for that
   which is born of the flesh is flesh,' John iii. 5, 6. Our souls
   naturally accommodate themselves to the flesh, and seek the good of the
   flesh, and all our thoughts and care, and life, and love run that way.
   Now, what was lost in Adam can only be recovered in Christ. It is not
   enough that God's hands have once made us and fashioned us, but there
   is a necessity of being made and fashioned anew, of becoming his
   workmanship in Christ Jesus,' Eph. ii. 10; and so the words of the text
   may be interpreted in this sense: Thou hast made me once; Lord, new
   make me: thy hands made me; O Lord, give me a new heart, that I may
   obey thee. In the first birth God gave us a natural understanding; in
   the second, a spiritual understanding, that we may learn his
   commandments; first that we may be good, and then do good. The first
   birth gave us the natural faculty, the second, the grace, or those
   divine qualities which were lost by Adam's sin. Better never been born,
   unless born again; better be a beast than a man, if the Lord give us
   not the knowledge of himself in Christ. The beasts, when they die,
   their misery and happiness dieth with them, death puts an end to their
   pain and pleasure; but, we that have reason and conscience to foresee
   the end and know the way, enter into perfect happiness or misery at
   death. Unless the Lord sanctify this reason, and give us a heart to
   know him in Christ, and choose that which is good, man is but a higher
   kind of beast, a wiser sort of beast, Ps. xlix. 12; for his soul is
   only employed to cater for the body, and his reason is prostituted to
   sense; the beast rides the man. We are not distinguished from the
   brutes by our senses, but our understanding and our reason. But in a
   carnal man, the soul is a kind of sense; it is wholly employed about
   the animal life. There is not a more brutish creature in the world than
   a worldly wicked man. Well, then, David had need to pray, Lord, thou
   hast given me reason; give me the knowledge of thyself and thy blessed
   will.

   6. When we seek this grace, or any degree of it, it is a proper
   argument to urge that we are God's creatures. So doth David here. I am
   now come to my very business, and therefore I shall a little show how
   far creation is pleadable, and may any way encourage us to ask
   spiritual understanding and renewing grace.

   [1.] In the general, I shall lay down this: It is a good way of
   reasoning with God to ask another gift because we have received one
   already. It is not a good way of reasoning with man, because he wastes
   by giving; but a good way with God, and that upon a double account.
   Partly because in some cases Deus donando debet--God by giving doth in
   effect bind himself to give more; as by giving life, to give food; by
   giving a body, to give raiment, Mat. vi. 25. God, by bending such a
   creature into the world, chargeth his providence to maintain him, as
   long as he will use him for his glory. God loveth to crown his own
   gifts: Zech. iii. 2, Is not this a brand plucked out of the burnings?'
   The thing pleaded there is, was not this a brand plucked out of the
   fire? One mercy is pleaded to obtain another mercy. So God bindeth
   himself to give perseverance, 2 Cor. i. 10; but this is not the case
   here; for by giving common benefits he doth not bind himself to give
   saving graces. And partly, too, because he doth not waste by giving:
   His mercy endureth for ever." The same reason is given for all those
   mercies, Ps. cxxxvi.; why the Lord chose a church, maintaineth his
   church, giveth daily bread: His mercy endureth for ever.' God is where
   he was at first: He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not,' James i. 5.
   He doth not say, I have given already. Now, a former common mercy
   showeth God's readiness and freeness to give; the inclination to do
   good still abideth with him; he is as ready and as free to give still;
   daily bread: His mercy endureth for ever:' spiritual wisdom: His mercy
   endureth for ever.' Indeed, the giving of daily bread doth not
   necessarily bind God to give spiritual wisdom; but that which is not a
   sure ground to expect may be a probable encouragement to ask. And learn
   this, that though nothing can satisfy unbelief, yet faith can pick
   arguments out of anything, and make use of the most common benefits of
   creation to strengthen itself.

   [2.] God beareth much affection to man as he is his creature and the
   work of his hands; and the saints plead it when they would be spared
   and when they would be saved. As Job, chap. x. 3, Is it good unto thee
   that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of
   thine hands?' So ver. 8 of that chapter, Thy hands have made me and
   fashioned me, and yet thou dost destroy ma' The sum and effect of these
   pleas is, it is strange that God should despise his own workmanship,
   especially a piece of such excellency as man is. Surely God is the
   readier to do good to man because he is the work of his hands. We see
   artificers, when they have made an excellent work, they are very chary
   and tender of it, and will not destroy it and break it in pieces. An
   instinct of nature teacheth us to love that which is our own by natural
   production; so it is an argument moving the Lord to much compassion to
   tell him that we are his workman ship: Isa. lxiv. 8, 9, But now, O
   Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, thou art our potter; we are
   all the work of thine hands: be not wroth with us very sore, O Lord.'
   This raiseth in us some hope of speeding and prevailing with God. The
   words of the text are emphatical, made and fashioned. God hath bestowed
   much care upon us to make and fashion us, and therefore he will pity us
   and spare us: Job xiv. 15, Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee;
   thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.' All these places
   show there is an argument in it that may raise our faith when other
   arguments fail.

   [3.] Creation implieth some hope, because God forsaketh none but those
   who forsake him first. He might destroy us for our original sin, as we
   destroy serpents of a venomous nature before they have actually done
   any harm. Though man hath lost his goodness, God hath not. Every one of
   us in person doth actually break with God before he breaketh with us: 2
   Chron. xv. 2, If ye forsake him, he will forsake you.' 1 Chron. xxviii.
   9, David telleth Solomon, If thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
   for ever:' he will not acknowledge thee. Take this rightly: that God
   giveth grace to any is his goodness; that to one more than another, is
   his distinguishing and elective love; that he denieth grace to any, is
   along of themselves, chargeable upon the creature, who abuse that
   common grace which, if improved, might have made them better; yea,
   though all deserve to be denied the grace of the Redeemer, yet it is
   not denied till after many wilful refusals, and by gross impenitency we
   turn the back upon God, when we will not implore our Creator's bounty,
   but obstinately refuse it.

   [4.] Seeing God is our creator, and the end of our creation is to serve
   God, we may the more confidently ask the grace which is necessary to
   enable us to serve him, that the same creating mercy which layeth on
   the obligation may help to discharge the debt. God is no Pharaoh, to
   require brick and give no straw, to appoint work and not to provide
   grace. Though he hath not absolutely promised to every individual
   person converting grace, yet he hath appointed certain means for the
   ungodly which they are bound to use in order to conversion; and if we
   consider the goodness of God, and the nature of those means, it is a
   great encouragement. Surely the assistances of grace are always ready:
   Mat. xxii. 5, Come to the feast, all things are ready.' None can tax
   him of backwardness. So our Saviour taxes the Jews: Mat. xxiii. 37, I
   would have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
   wing, but ye would not.' When did God ever fail the waiting soul, or
   put away the creature that sought after grace to serve him? He is often
   beforehand with us, never behindhand; and we grossly and heinously
   forfeit all our means and helps before we lose them.

   [5.] There is encouragement to faith a pari, from the resemblance and
   likeness that is between his making us at first and his new-making of
   us in Jesus Christ. It is called a creation, Eph. ii. 10; Eph. iv. 24,
   The new man, which after God is created,' &c.; 2 Cor. iv. 6, God, who
   commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our
   hearts.' The author is the same God to whom it belongeth to create. We
   have the human nature from him, and can have it from no other, much
   less can we have the divine nature from any other but him, Ps. li. 5,
   or else we should not have it at all. It is not implanted in our
   nature, or attainable by any industry of ours: It is not of him that
   willeth, or of him that runneth,' Rom. ix. 16, but the immediate work
   of God; it is the work of his omnipotency. So dead and indisposed are
   we by nature to holiness and grace, that no less than creating power is
   required to work it in us. Besides, we were created freely, without any
   merit of ours; so we expect from the same goodness such saving
   knowledge as may change our hearts. There is this double
   encouragement--there is God's omnipotent power, and his free giving us
   his image at first, Rom. iv. 17.

   [6.] If we consider the manner of pleading, and the good frame of heart
   implied in the pleader, we may better understand the cogency of the
   argument; and though the argument itself doth not necessarily infer the
   help of grace, yet the manner of pleading showeth some preparative work
   of grace, and such meet the Lord in the stated order of commerce
   between him and his creatures, and shall receive his blessing. And then
   the argument will be strong in this petition, Give understanding, that
   I may learn thy commandments.' Here are many things implied, such as
   are wrought by God in those to whom God will vouchsafe the grace.

   (1.) An acknowledgment of the debt, that man, being God's creature, is
   obliged to serve him; as he was not made by himself, so not for
   himself; and should no more cease from intending God as an end, than he
   can cease from depending on God as a principle. Now, it is long ere we
   are brought to this. You know how the rebels are described and set out,
   Ps. xii. 4, Our tongues are our own; who is lord over us?' Now God hath
   gained one great end with us when we are sensible of our obligation to
   him, and are brought to acknowledge the debt, and that love, duty, and
   service we owe to him. Wherefore doth God press duty upon carnal men,
   who are no way competent or able to perform it? Divines tell us, to
   demand his right, as a creditor doth of a prodigal debtor, and to make
   us sensible that we stand bound to God in the debt of obedience.

   (2.) Here is a will to pay, or a heart set upon service and obedience;
   for this is a speech becoming one heartily devoted to God, Thy hands
   have made me,' &c. He would willingly return to his creator's service,
   and glorify him with what was made by him: I acknowledge that I am
   obliged, as I am the work of thine hands, to live in a faithful
   obedience to thee; Lord, I give up myself to this work. Mark, this is a
   good spirit; he doth not beg his own comfort, but ability for ser vice,
   that he might so know his master's will as to do it. Now this is
   repentance towards God, when we are heartily willing to return to our
   duty more than to our comfort, Acts ii. 21; there is more hope of that
   soul that rather seeketh obedience than comfort, and where there is a
   resolved will and purpose to devote ourselves to the Lord, to please
   him, and serve him. This was God's end in his new covenant grace, and
   Christ's end in redemption, to restore us to obedience as well as to
   favour, and put us into a capacity of service again: Heb. ix. 14, Purge
   our consciences from dead works to serve the living God;' 1 Peter ii.
   24, Who his own self bare our sins in his body on the tree, that we,
   being dead to sin, might live unto righteousness.' He died to weaken
   the love of sin in our hearts, and to advance the life and power of
   grace and righteousness.

   (3.) There is implied in it a confession of impotency, that God cannot
   be glorified and served by him unless he be renewed and strengthened by
   grace; not by him as a creature till he be made a new creature, or have
   renewed influences of grace from him. God permitted the lapse and fall
   of mankind, that they may come to him as needy creatures, and take all
   out of his hands. Man's great error, which occasioned his fall, was
   that he would live alone apart from God, be sufficient to his own
   happiness. We greedily caught at that word, Ye shall be as gods,' Gen.
   iii. 5. The meaning was, not in a blessed conformity, but a cursed
   self-sufficiency. Man would be his own god, desired to have his stock
   in his own hands, and would be no more at God's finding: Gen. iii. 22,
   The man is become as one of us,' to live as an independent being. Well,
   then, to cure this, God would reduce him to an utter necessity, that he
   might bring him to an entire dependence, and might come as a beggarly
   indigent creature, expecting all from God, putting no confidence in his
   own righteousness for his justification, nor natural power and strength
   for sanctification: Gal. ii. 19, I through the law am dead to the law,
   that I might live unto God.' The rigorous exaction of perfect obedience
   under the hazard of the curse of the law maketh them dead to the law;
   the curse of the law puts them so hard to it, that they are forced to
   fly to Christ to be freed from condemnation; and the spiritual nature
   of the law, as it is a rule of obedience, driveth them to see there is
   nothing in themselves tending to righteousness, and holiness, to the
   glory of God, without the power of his Spirit: they that serve in the
   newness of the spirit,' Rom. vii. 6. God bringeth us at last to this:
   Mat. xix. 26, With men it is impossible, but with God all things are
   possible.' Well, then, when we are brought to see our impotency, we are
   at a good pass, and lie obvious to his grace.

   (4.) It implies an earnest desire after grace; and that is a good frame
   of heart, when not satisfied with common benefits. David was not
   satisfied with his natural being, but seeketh after a spiritual being.
   What is that he prayeth so earnestly for, but an enlightened mind and a
   renewed heart, and all that he might be obedient to God? Thus we are
   more fitted to receive grace. A conscience of our duty is a great
   matter in fallen man, who is turned rebel against God and a traitor to
   his maker, who is impatient and self-willed, and all for casting off
   the yoke, Ps. ii. 3. Well, to have a heart set upon duty and obedience,
   that is the next step; the third was a sense of impotency; now this
   fourth a desire of grace: such the Lord hath promised to satisfy, Mat.
   v. 6. These open unto God, and are ready to take in his grace. Come as
   creatures earnestly desiring to do your creator's will, and in the best
   manner, and will God refuse you? Because I am thy creature, teach me to
   serve thee, who art my creator.

   (5.) There is one thing more in this plea, a persuasion of God's
   goodness to his creatures. This is the very ground and reason why this
   plea is used: Pa cxlv. 9, The Lord is good to all, and his tender
   mercies are over all his works.' There is a great deal of fatherly care
   and mercy to his creatures, till by their impenitency, persisted in
   against the means of grace, they render themselves incapable of it The
   first battery which Satan laid to man's heart tended to undermine the
   sense of God's goodness to the creature, as if God were envious: Gen.
   iii. 5, Doth not God know that in the day ye eat thereof;' as if God
   envied their happiness: this the devil would instil. To have good
   thoughts of God is a great means to reduce us and bring us back again
   to him. We frighten ourselves away from him by entertaining needless
   jealousies of him, as if he sought our destruction, or delighted in it
   Surely he will not destroy a poor soul that lieth submissively at his
   feet, and is grieved he can no better please him and serve him. The man
   that had hard thoughts of God neglected his duty: Mat. xxv. 24, 25, I
   knew thou wast an austere master, therefore I hid my talent in a
   napkin;' that is the legalism and carnal bondage that is in us, which
   makes us full of jealousies of God, and doth mightily hinder and
   obstruct our duty.

   Use. The use is to press you to come to God as creatures, to beg relief
   and help for your souls: this will be of use to us in many cases.

   1. To the scrupulous, who are upon regenerating, that are not sure that
   the work of grace is wrought in them. You cannot call God Father by the
   spirit of adoption; yet own him as a creator. Come to him as one that
   formed you: your desire is to return to him.

   2. It is of use to believers when under desertions, and God appeareth
   against them in a way of wrath, and all God's dispensations seem to
   speak nothing but wrath: yet come to him as the creator. Lord, we are
   the work of thy hands.' If you cannot plead the covenant of Abraham,
   which was made with believers, plead the covenant of Noah, which was
   made with man and all creatures: Isa. liv. 9, For this is as the waters
   of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no
   more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with
   thee, nor rebuke thee;' there may be a great storm, but no deluge. When
   all is wrath to a poor soul, let it come to him in the covenant of
   Noah.

   3. It will be of use in pleading for grace for your children, who are
   as yet, it may be, graceless and disobedient: Thy hands have made and
   fashioned them.' Desire him to renew his image upon them by the spirit
   of grace.

   In short, the sum of all is, here is encouragement: God is good to all
   his creatures, especially to man, most especially to man seeking after
   him, and seeking after him for grace, that we and ours may obey him,
   and do him better service than ever yet we have done.

SERMON LXXXII.

   They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped
   in thy word.--Ver. 74.

   THIS verse containeth two things:--

   1. The respect of the faithful to David, they that fear thee will be
   glad when they see me.

   2. The reason of this respect, because I have hoped in thy word.

   First, The respect of God's faithful servants to David, and there take
   notice of the character by which God's servants are described, They
   that fear thee;' then their respect to David, they will be glad when
   they see me;' which may bear a double sense.

   1. How comfortable it is for the heirs of promise to see one another,
   or meet together! Aspectus boni viri delectat--the very look of a good
   man is delightful; it is a pleasure to converse with those that are
   careful to please God, and awe-ful to offend him.

   2. How much affected they are with one another's mercies: They will be
   glad to see me,' who have obtained an event answerable to my hope; they
   shall come and look upon me as a monument and spectacle of the mercy
   and truth of God. This sense I prefer, though not excluding the other.
   But what mercy had he received? The context seemeth to carry it for
   grace to obey God's commandments; that was the prayer immediately
   preceding, to be instructed and taught in God's law,' ver. 73. Now they
   will rejoice to see my holy behaviour, how I have profited and
   glorified God in that behalf. The Hebrew writers render the reason,
   Because then I shall be able to instruct them in those statutes, when
   they shall see me, their king, study the law of God. It may be
   expounded of any other blessing or benefit God hath given according to
   his hope; and I rather understand it thus: they will be glad to see him
   sustained, supported, and borne out in his troubles and sufferings;
   they will be glad when they shall see in me a notable example of the
   fruit of hoping in thy grace, and this hope leaveth not ashamed.

   Secondly, The reason is, Because I hoped in thy word:' and there
   compare this with the first clause. God's children are described to be
   those that fear God, and David is described to be one that hopes in his
   word. Both together make up a good character and description of the
   Lord's people; they are such as fear God and hope in his word. They are
   elsewhere coupled: Ps. xxxiii. 18, Behold the eye of the Lord is upon
   them that fear him, that hope in his mercy:' and Ps. cxlvii. 11, The
   Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, that hope in his mercy.' A
   sincere Christian is known by both these; a fear of God, or a constant
   obedience to his commands, and an affiance, trust, and dependence upon
   his mercies. Oh, how sweetly are both these coupled; a uniform sincere
   obedience to him, and an unshaken constant reliance on his mercy and
   goodness! The whole perfection of the Christian life is comprised in
   these two--believing God and fearing him, trusting in his mercy and
   fearing his name; the one maketh us careful in avoiding sin, the other
   diligent to follow after righteousness; the one is a bridle from sin
   and temptations, the other a spur to our duties. Fear is our curb, and
   hope our motive and encouragement; the one respects our duty, the other
   our comfort; the one allayeth the other. God is so to be feared, as
   also to be trusted; so to be trusted, as also to be feared. And as we
   must not suffer our fear to degenerate into legal bondage, but hope in
   his mercy; so our trust must not degenerate into carnal sloth and
   wantonness, but so hope in his word as to fear his name. Well, then,
   such as both believe in God and fear to offend him are the only men who
   are acceptable to God and his people. God will take pleasure in them,
   and they take pleasure in one another: They that fear thee will be glad
   when they see me.' The first part of the character, They that fear
   thee:' the fear of God is an excellent grace, a strong bridle to hold
   the soul from sin; not that servile, but filial and child-like fear,
   that is afraid to sin against God or break his laws: Prov. xxviii. 14,
   Blessed is the man that feareth always;' this grace should always bear
   rule in our hearts: 1 Peter i. 17, Pass the time of your sojourning in
   fear:' our whole course must be carried on under the conduct of this
   grace. Look, as the fear of man is a bridle upon the beasts to keep
   them from hurting man, Gen. ix. 2, The fear and dread of you shall be
   upon every beast of the earth:' so when the fear of God is rooted in
   our hearts, we are kept from disobeying and dishonouring God. Joseph is
   an instance of the power of this holy fear: Gen. xxxix. 9, How shall I
   do this great wickedness, and sin against God?' Secondly, the other
   character, I hope in thy word:' a Christian liveth by faith, whereas
   the brutish worldling liveth by sense; the one liveth by bread only,
   the other by the word of God; the one is a higher sort of beast, the
   other is a kind of earthly angel, for he liveth with God, and dwelleth
   with God, and expecteth all out of God's hands: Ps. cxxx. 5, I wait for
   the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope:' there is his
   charter and inheritance, and his solace and support; he fetcheth all
   from the word. Both these graces, as they are very acceptable unto God,
   so are they most lovely and beautiful to behold by men; to be among the
   company of them that fear God, and hope in his word, is the most
   pleasant thing to a gracious heart that car* be; for while others are
   taken up about toys and trifles, they are taken up about the only
   serious matters. If Balaam was constrained to say of God's people, How
   goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!' oh, how
   pleasant is it much more to the people of God, to see one another, to
   come among them that fear God, and are loath to offend him, and also
   that hope in his word! They can speak of the life of faith, and
   blessedness to come, and take off the veil of the creature, and are
   mainly taken up with another world; their business is not to offend God
   here, and hope fully to enjoy him hereafter: Rom. i. 12, Comforted by
   the mutual faith both of you and me.'

   Doct. That God's mercies bestowed upon some of his children should be
   and are an occasion of joy and comfort to all the rest. When David was
   a pattern of God's gracious help and deliverance, he saith, They that
   fear thee will be glad when they see me.' I shall give you some
   scriptures: Ps. cxlii. 7, The righteous shall compass me about, for
   thou shalt deal bountifully with me.' When any one of God's children
   are delivered, all the rest flock about him, to assist and join in
   thanksgiving, and to help one another to praise the Lord. So Ps. xxxiv.
   2, My soul shall make her boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear
   thereof and be glad:' that God had preserved and reserved David still.
   So Ps. lxiv. 10, The righteous shall be glad in the Lord and trust in
   him, and the upright in heart shall glory:' that is, when David was
   delivered, when God had showed mercy to him, then all the upright would
   come, and make their own profit and advantage by such an experience and
   deliverance.

   The reasons of the point.

   1. They are all members of one body, they are all called into one body,
   and the good and evil of one member is common to the whole. This reason
   is rendered by the apostle: 1 Cor. xii. 25, 26, But that the members
   should have the same care one for another. And whether one member
   suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all
   the rest rejoice with it;' ver. 27, Now ye are the body of Christ, and
   members in particular.' The meaning of that place is, that the church
   altogether is the body of Christ, and every several person a member,
   and every member should be as solicitous for one another as for itself;
   they have the same common interests and concernments, whether of
   suffering or rejoicing. You know in the natural body, when the toe is
   trode on, the tongue crieth out, You have hurt me. We are concerned in
   the good or ill of our fellow-members; their joy is joy to us, and
   their sorrow sorrow to us: to this sense some expound that place, Heb.
   xiii. 3, Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them, and them
   that suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.' Some
   understand it of Christ's mystical body; when they suffer, our souls
   are bound with them. But I think it bears another sense there: to be in
   the body' is to be in the flesh, during which state we are liable to
   many vexations and miseries; and therefore, if God doth so order it
   that the whole body, or all the members of the church, should not be
   afflicted at one time, but whilst some are afflicted others are free,
   and when we are not involved by passion there may be compassion. While
   we are in the body we are obnoxious to the same adversities, and should
   pity and comfort them as ourselves, and use all means to do 4hem good;
   but if it be not the truth of the place, yet it is a truth, the more
   any partake of the spiritual life the stronger is spiritual sympathy:
   they rejoice with them that rejoice, and mourn with them that mourn,'
   Rom. xii. 15; are bound with them that are in bonds, and enlarged with
   them that are enlarged. One part of us is in bonds when they are in
   bonds, one part of us is enlarged when they are enlarged; still we
   should have common interests and affections with our brethren; and for
   those that fear God to be selfish and senseless of the condition of
   others, it is a kind of self-excommunication, or an implicit renouncing
   the body: because we are in the body, we should be affected as they
   are. Look, as there was the same spirit in Ezekiel's vision in the
   living creatures and the wheels, 1 say the same spirit was in both;
   when one moved the other moved: so there is the same spirit in Christ's
   mystical body. We should be affected as they are; it is a kind of
   depriving ourselves of the privileges of the mystical body if we are
   not.

   2. It is for the honour and glory of God; God hath most glory when
   praised by many. Therefore they flock together, 2 Cor. i. 11, That for
   the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be
   given by many in our behalf.' God loveth to have us act with joint
   consent both in prayer and praise, because he would interest us in one
   another's mercies and comforts, and so knit our hearts together in more
   holy love. Prayers made by many are mighty with God--when we come to
   God with many supplicants, make up a great party to besiege heaven: so
   praises rendered by many are the more honourable to God, and acceptable
   with him: 2 Cor. iv. 15, That the abundant grace might, through the
   thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.' When many are
   engaged, and many are affected with it, God's glory is the more
   diffused, the revenue of the crown of heaven increased. One string
   maketh no music; when there are many, and all in tune, there is
   harmony. There are three things in it--many righteous persons, and
   joining together with one spirit in the same work, then the Lord hath
   more honour than he could have in a single person. In heaven God is
   praised in concert; we are brought all together, that we may make one
   body and congregation to laud, and praise, and serve God for evermore:
   so here, they that fear God and hope in his mercy, they often flock
   together to congratulate and join in thanksgiving for the mercies which
   any one of them hath received. When Christ was born there was a whole
   concert of angels: Luke ii. 13, A multitude of the heavenly host
   praising God, saying, Glory to God on high, on earth peace, good-will
   towards men.' It is a kind of heaven upon earth when all the people of
   God are led by one spirit to praise and glorify God: a closet prayer or
   thanksgiving is not so honourable as that of the congregation.

   3. It is for the profit and comfort of all; partly because by this
   means they come to understand one another's experiences for their
   mutual support and edification. What God is to one that feareth him, he
   is to all that fear him sincerely, affected to them all; therefore the
   goodness of God to one believer bringeth joy and comfort to all the
   rest. They are spectacles and monuments of mercy for the saints to look
   upon, that they may learn thereby to depend upon God. Look, as in
   converting Paul, a persecutor, the apostle saith, 1 Tim. i. 16, Christ
   did show forth all long-suffering in me, for a pattern to them that
   should after believe on him,' in pardoning so great a sinner, in saving
   such a distressed soul, to invite others to Christ; so in all other
   cases, when God delivereth one, he inviteth others to the same hope;
   they are precedents of mercy to the rest, as David implieth here they
   would be encouraged by his example cheerfully to expect the same
   deliverance from God. In the example of one sufferer there is a pawn
   given to all the rest; it is for the edification and encouragement of
   others to be acquainted with our experiences of God's mercy to us: Ps.
   lxvi. 16, Come near, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
   hath done for my soul;' all are concerned, for they have the same
   necessities, have interest in the same God, the same promises, the same
   mediator, and the same covenant; so that to be acquainted with the
   passages of divine providence towards others is a great help to teach
   us more of God, that we may learn to magnify his power. And partly by
   this means their hearts are more knit to one another in spiritual love;
   when they pray for one another as for their own souls, and rejoice as
   in their own deliverance, it maintaineth unity among us. God loveth to
   pleasure many of his children at once, and to interest them in the same
   mercy; and so we receive the mercy others intercede for, and give
   thanks for it. Love in the spirit is seen in praying and praising God
   for one another. And partly, too, because it doth oblige us to more
   frequent acts of worship; we can never want an errand to the throne of
   grace, or an opportunity of worship for ourselves or others, to pray
   with them, or to offer praise with them and for them.

   4. Joy is communicative; mourning apart is good: Peter went out and
   wept bitterly,' Mat. xxvi. 75. And Jeremiah saith, when he would weep
   for the people, Jer. xiii. 17, My soul shall weep in secret places for
   your pride;' and Zech. xii. 12, 13, They shall mourn every family
   apart, the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart,'
   &c. Sorrow affecteth solitude and retiredness, where no eye seeth but
   God's; but joy doth best in company and in consort, as the Woman called
   her neighbours to rejoice with her, Luke xv., because she bad found the
   lost groat. So we must stir up one another to rejoice in God. Besides,
   mercies may be told to many, but not our griefs; therefore the godly
   will be flocking together to help them in praises as well as prayers.
   It is not only commendable to beg their help in prayer, but we should
   call upon them to praise God with us: Ps. xxxiv. 3, O magnify the Lord
   with me, and let us exalt his name together.' We are bound to be
   witnesses of one another's thankfulness, and to assist one another in
   the praises of God.

   Use. Information of five things:--

   1. It showeth us the lawfulness, yea, the conveniency, yea, in some
   sort, the necessity, of public thanksgiving for private mercies. It is
   lawful; we read of paying vows in the great congregation, Ps. xxii. 22,
   xl. 9. It is highly convenient and useful, partly that the people of
   God may flock together, and make a crown of praise for God: Ps. xxii.
   3, He inhabiteth the praises of Israel;' he delighteth to be in the
   midst of his people when they praise him. And partly that by the
   thankfulness of others we may be quickened to remember our own mercies,
   as one bird sets all the flock a-chirping. And partly that we may
   quicken others by our help; and partly to show a Christ-like love to
   them, by being affected with their miseries, and rejoicing in their
   mercies. Well, these things should quicken us to join with others in
   their thanksgiving for their private mercies, so to raise a spiritual
   affection in us in the performance of those duties. And as it is
   lawful, so it is necessary; other men's mercies may be our mercies as
   well as theirs; you are concerned in the mercy if you have prayed for
   it. We are to love God for hearing our prayers for others as well as
   ourselves. Eli gave thanks and solemnly worshipped God for Hannah's
   sake, because he had before prayed for her, and therefore praised God
   for her, who had heard his prayers in her behalf: compare 1 Sam. i. 28.
   When Hannah told him what the Lord had done, Eli falls a worshipping
   the Lord; he had prayed for her before in ver. 7, The Lord grant thee
   thy petition which thou askest of him.' Every answer of prayer is a new
   proof or fresh experience of God's love and special respect to us; it
   is a sign that God regardeth us and is mindful of us, nay, it is a sign
   of God's favour, when he will not only hear us for ourselves, but for
   others also. If a man come to a king, he will say, If you had asked for
   yourself I would have granted you; it is a special honour to intercede
   for others, which God putteth upon his choice servants: Gen. xx. 7,
   Abraham shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live;' Job xlii. 8, My
   servant Job shall pray for you, and him will I accept.' God will hear
   his servants for others when he will not hear them for themselves. If
   our prayers had returned into our own bosoms, as David's for his
   enemies, Ps. xxxv. 13; if God as an answer had given you only the
   comfort of the discharge of your duty: Luke x. 6, If they be not
   worthy, your peace shall return to you again:' this were matter of
   praise, much more now the mercy is obtained. All this is spoken to show
   that there should be more life and spiritual affection in those duties
   which we perform in the behalf of others.

   2. It informeth us of the excellency of communion of saints; there is
   such a fellowship and communion between all the members of Christ's
   mystical body, that they mourn together, and rejoice together; the
   grace vouchsafed to one is cause of rejoicing to all the rest; they
   drive on a joint trade for heaven, and rejoice in one another's
   comforts as if they were their own, in one another's gifts and graces
   as if they were their own, in one another's supports and deliverances
   as if they were their own. We read of joy in heaven at the conversion
   of sinners; they rejoice at our welfare, praising and lauding God; so
   there is also joy on earth when any spiritual benefit is imparted; if
   any be gotten to a godlike nature, they give thanks to God: They that
   fear thee will be glad when they see me;' Acts iv. 32, The multitude of
   them that believed were of one heart and of one soul;' there was a
   great multitude, many thousand souls. Here was the primitive
   simplicity, the Christians were so united as if they had but one heart
   and soul among them; and it was a usual saying, Aspice ut se mutuo
   diligunt Christiani--see how the Christians love one another. It was
   otherwise afterwards; no wild beasts are so fierce to one another as
   one Christian has been to another. Surely it concerneth all that fear
   God and hope in his word to be of one heart and of one mind as much as
   may be. Lesser differences should not make void this Christ-like love.
   The bonds of Christ's communion are the essentials of religion, if they
   fear God and hope in his word. Though Christians may be distinguished
   by several denominations, yet an angry brother cannot cast us out of
   our Father's family. We set up walls of partition between Christian and
   Christian, but God will not measure his fold by our enclosure: Lingua
   Petiliani non est ventilabrum Christi--it is well Petilian's tongue is
   not Christ's fan. Surely when we meet with our ever lasting companions
   they should be dear to us, and for some private differences we should
   not omit the necessary duties of Christianity. This mutual and cordial
   respect we should have for one another.

   3. It informs us of the mischief and evil of a private spirit, which
   doth not take notice of the favours of God done to others, nor is
   affected with others' mercies. Most men seek their own things,' Phil.
   ii. 21. Nature is sensible of nothing but natural bonds, the lines of
   its communication are too narrow, either their own flesh, the smart and
   ease of their own bodies, or their own kindred. Now, the saints have a
   more diffusive love, they can strive with God earnestly in prayer for
   those whose face they never saw in the flesh, Col. ii., and can be
   thankful for their mercies as far as they come to their notice. All
   Christians are not only of the same kind, but of the same body; though
   they have not a private benefit by the mercy, yet they can heartily
   praise God for it; the angels praise God for us, Luke ii., for his
   good-will to men, they are only spectators, not the parties interested.
   When the Lord set afoot that blessed design, it was good will to men,
   yet the multitude of the heavenly host rejoiced and praised God. We had
   both honour and benefit by Christ's incarnation. So to praise God for
   the good of others argueth a good spirit like the angels, but to envy
   the good of another and be grieved thereat is devilish, like the spirit
   of the devil. In heaven we shall not only rejoice in our own, but in
   one another's salvation, because there shall be no envy, no privateness
   of affection. Why are we so selfish and senseless now? Who is afflicted
   and I mourn not?' said Paul. Now to those that mourned for others'
   calamity, their deliverance is a kind of relief. Will you lose your
   evidence of being in the body for want of rejoicing in their mercies,
   gifts, and deliverances?

   4. It informeth us--(1.) How much it concerneth us to preserve an
   interest in the hearts of God's people, and to behave ourselves so that
   they that fear God may be glad of our mercies, and bless God for them.
   The communion of saints is a sweet thing; we must not forfeit this
   privilege by our inordinate walking, pride, contention, sourness and
   bitterness of spirit, unusefulness to the church, as having an interest
   divided from the church. Those whose mercies are apprehended as a
   public benefit are the strictly conscientious, those that fear God and
   hope in his word, who labour to keep themselves from the snares of the
   present world, and look for the happiness of the world to come; the one
   is the fruit of fearing God, the other of hoping in his word--the
   tender conscience and the heavenly-minded Christian. Partly because
   they are our everlasting companions; we shall live for ever with them:
   they were chosen from all eternity to be heirs of the same grace
   together with us; therefore it is sweet to praise God for any good that
   befalleth them: Ps. lxvi. 16, Come near, all ye that fear God, and I
   will tell you what he hath done for my soul;' Ps. xxii. 22, I will
   declare thy name unto my brethren.' But when a man walketh
   questionably, he obscureth the life of God in himself, or, like a
   string that is out of tune, spoileth the harmony. The saints may mourn
   for the wicked, but they cannot so easily bring their hearts to rejoice
   with them; they may give thanks for their mercies, it is true, 1 Tim.
   ii. 1, 2, but not with that cheerfulness, with that sense. The
   conscience of our duty engageth us to bless God that he hath spared
   them, reprieved them a little longer, given them more time to repent,
   and correct their errors; but it is very sweet to join with them who
   are our brethren and companions, not only now, but to all eternity. And
   partly because our mercies proceed from the covenant, upon which is
   built all our hope and all our desire, and so we are edified by the
   support and help which God affordeth to them that fear him and hope in
   his word; thereby we see that they that wait long wait not in vain on
   the word of God's promise, and so learn to wait with patience
   ourselves, because those who depended on his promised assistance are
   then answered and supported; yea, it is a ground of hope to all that so
   many will be gratified by the deliverance of one, when we so work for
   the deliverance of one that at length both he and others will have
   cause to be glad. (2.) Another thing is, it doth encourage others'
   prayers and praises for us, when we are useful and profitable, and
   bring in that supply to the body which may be justly expected from us
   according to the measure of that part which we sustain in the body.
   Look, as in the natural body the blood and the life passeth to and fro,
   there is a giving and receiving between all the members that live in
   the communion of it, so mutual obligations pass between the children of
   God. Many are interested in their mercies that are of use in the
   church: Rom. v. 7, For a good man some would even dare to die,' such as
   David or Paul; yet this is no discouragement to the meanest or weakest,
   for they have their honour and use: When ye fail they shall receive
   you,' Luke xvi. 9; they have their ministry and service: Now the head
   cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee,' 1 Cor. xii. 21. (3.)
   The humble and the meek, for the proud procure their own just dislike
   and disappointment. Solomon telleth us, Only by pride cometh
   contention,' Prov. xiii. 10. Pride is the great impediment and let to
   all Christian offices. We cannot so heartily pray for one another, nor
   praise God for one another, when pride and contention prevaileth. We
   should overcome this stomach and spleen: Bless them that curse you;' as
   David fasted for his enemies when they sought his life, Ps. xxxv. 12.
   You should not lay this stumbling-block in the way of their duty; it is
   a great discouragement.

   5. It informeth us how comfortable and how pleasant the converse and
   conference of godly persons is, and how much it excelleth the merriest
   meetings of the carnal. The special love which the godly have to one
   another doth exceedingly sweeten their converse, for the very presence
   of those we most dearly love is a pleasure to us to see, but much more
   their holy conference. When Christians meet together and find their own
   persuasions of the love, power, mercy and wisdom of God backed with the
   experience and testimony of others, it is a mutual strength and support
   to us; and therefore the apostle saith, Rom i. 12, That I may be
   comforted together with you, by the mutual faith of you and me.' When
   we converse with them that can speak, not by hearsay only, but by
   experience, of the power of the blood of Christ in purifying their
   consciences, and his Spirit to sanctify their hearts, it is a mighty
   prop: 2 Cor. i. 4, And that we may comfort others with the comforts
   where with we are comforted of God.' Report of a report is a cold
   thing, not valued, but a report of what we witness and experience
   ourselves comes warmly upon our hearts. Nay, many times it may fall out
   that people of less knowledge, but more feeling and experience, may
   abundantly confirm the more knowing, and excite them to a greater
   mindfulness of God and heavenly things. But alas! the meetings of
   carnal per sons, what are they to this? It may be they will fill your
   ears with stories of hawking and hunting, the best wine and delicious
   meats, of honours and purchases in the world, all which tend but to
   increase the gust of the flesh, and the carnal savour which is baneful
   to us; or else with idle stories, the clatter of vanity, which are
   impertinent to our great end; or else about the world, thriving in the
   world: nothing about those high and excellent and necessary things of
   the grace of God in Christ, and the truth of the promises, and the
   glory of the world to come: Ps. xxxvii. 30, 31, The mouth of the
   righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment: the law
   of God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide:' and The mouth
   of the righteous is as choice silver;' they have a sense of better
   things. But alas! from others you hear nothing but unsavoury vanity,
   which is as different from the discourse of the children of God as the
   melody of a bird from the grunting of a hog or swine.

SERMON LXXXIII.

   I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that in faithfulness
   thou hast afflicted me.--Ver. 75.

   WE have need all to prepare for afflictions, for we are to take up our
   cross daily. Now, to help you to a right carriage under them, these
   words, well considered, will be of some use to you; they are the
   confession of a humble soul abundantly satisfied with God's
   dispensations. In them observe:--

   1. A general truth or point of doctrine concerning the equity of God's
   judgments, thy judgments, O Lord, are right.

   2. A particular application or accommodation of this truth to David's
   case and person, in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.

   3. His sure and firm persuasion of both, I know. Let us explain these
   branches and parts of the text as they are laid forth.

   1. The general truth, the Lord's judgments are right. In which
   proposition there is the subject and the predicate. The subject or
   things spoken are the Lord's judgments. The word is often put in this
   psalm and elsewhere for God's statutes, or precepts, or righteous laws;
   and in this sense some take it here, and make out the sense thus: Lord,
   I know that thy judgments,' viz., thy precepts, are holy, just, and
   good; and this persuasion is not lessened in me, though thou hast
   sharply afflicted me: I have as great a value and esteem for thy word
   as ever. But rather, by the Lord's judgments are meant the pas sages of
   his providence, as the latter clause showeth; those judicial
   dispensations whereby he doth punish the wicked, or correct his
   children. And let it not seem strange that the troubles and afflictions
   of the godly should be called judgments; for though there be no
   vindictive wrath in them, yet they are called so upon a double reason:
   partly because they are acts of God's holy justice, correcting and
   humbling his people for sin, according to the sentence of his word.
   Thus it is said, 1 Peter iv. 17, that judgment shall begin at the house
   of God;' where the trials and troubles of the godly are plainly called
   judgments. And partly because the Lord judiciously measureth and
   directeth them as the state of his children requireth and their
   strength will bear. So it is said, Jer. x. 24, Correct me, but in
   judgment' The first notion implieth God's justice, the second his
   wisdom. And mark, it is said distinctly in the text, Thy judgments, O
   Lord.' His enemies might unjustly persecute him, but thy judgments;' so
   far as the Lord hath a hand in it, all was just and right: this is the
   subject or thing spoken of. Secondly, Here is the predicate, or what is
   said of it, are right;' the Hebrew, tsedec; the Septuagint, o'ti
   dikaiosu'ne ta` kri'mata sou, are righteousness itself; thy
   dispensations are wholly made up of perfect justice; how smart soever
   they be, they are right as to the cause, right as to the measure, right
   as to the end. The first of these respects concerneth God's justice,
   the two other his wisdom. First, Right as to the cause; they never
   exceed the value of their impulsive: Job xxxiv. 23, He will not lay
   upon man more than is right, that he should enter into judgment with
   him.' God never afflicteth his people above their desert, nor gives any
   just occasion to commence a suit against his providence. Secondly,
   Right as to the measure, not above the strength of the patient. In his
   own people's afflictions it is BO: Isa. xxvii. 8, In measure when it
   shooteth forth thou wilt debate it; he stayeth his rough wind in the
   day of the east wind.' God dealeth with his own with much moderation,
   meting out their sufferings in due proportion. So Jer. xxx. 11, I will
   correct thee in measure.' Thirdly, Right as to their end and use. God
   knoweth how to strike in the right vein, and to suit his providence to
   the purpose for which it is appointed: the kind of the affliction is to
   be considered as well as the measure. The Lord chooseth that rod which
   is most likely to do his work. Paul had a thorn in the flesh, that he
   might not be exalted above measure, 2 Cor. xii. 7. He was a man inured
   to dangers and troubles from without, these were familiar to him,
   therefore he could the better bear them; but God would humble him by
   some pain in the flesh, which should sit near and close.

   2. The particular accommodation of it to David, In faithfulness thou
   hast afflicted me.' Pray mark, in the general case he observeth
   justice; in his own, faithfulness. The book called Midrash Tillim
   referreth these words to David's flight from Absalom, when he went to
   Mount Olivet weeping; it was an ill time then with David, he had no
   security for his life; being driven from his house and home, He went up
   Mount Olivet, going and weeping,' 2 Sam. xv. 30. Then, when so great
   and sore trouble was upon him, then he saith, I know that in
   faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.' Mark the emphasis; lie doth not
   barely acknowledge that God was faithful, though, or not withstanding
   he had afflicted him, but faithful in sending them. Affliction and
   trouble are not only consistent with God's love plighted in the
   covenant of grace, but they are parts and branches of the new covenant
   administration. God is not only faithful notwithstanding afflictions,
   but faithful in sending them. There is a difference between these two;
   the one is like an exception to the rule, quae firmat regulam in non
   exceptis; the other makes it a part of the rule. God cannot be faithful
   without doing all things that tend to our good and eternal welfare: the
   conduct of his providence is one part of the covenant engagement: as to
   pardon our sins, and sanctify us, and give us glory at the last, so to
   suit his providence as our need and profit requireth in the way to
   heaven. It is an act of his sovereign mercy, which he hath promised to
   his people, to use such discipline as conduceth to their safety. In
   short, the cross is not only an exception to the grace of the covenant,
   but, a part of the grace of the covenant. The meaning is, God is
   obliged in point of fidelity to send sharp afflictions: Ps. lxxxix. 32,
   I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with
   stripes.' Sharp rods and sore stripes not only may stand and be
   reconciled with God's loving-kindness and truth, but they are effects
   and expressions of it; it is a part of that transaction, viz., his
   covenant love.

   3. The third thing to be explained is his sense of these truths, I
   know.' Knowing implies clearness of apprehension and firmness of
   persuasion; so that, I know, is I fully understand, or else, I am
   confident or well assured of this truth. But from whence had David his
   knowledge? how knew he all God's judgments to be right? Not from the
   flesh, or from natural sense. No; the flesh is importunate to be
   pleased, will persuade us to the contrary. If we consult only with
   natural sense, we shall never believe that, when God is hacking and
   hewing at us, he intendeth our good and benefit, and that when sore
   judgments are upon us, his end is not to destroy, but to save, to
   mortify the sin, and save the person. Sense will teach us no such
   thing, but will surely misinterpret and misexpound the Lord's dealings;
   for the peace of God is a riddle to a natural heart, Phil. iv. 7.
   Whence then had David his knowledge? Partly from the word of God, and
   partly from his own observation and particular experience.

   [1.] From the word of God; for it is a maxim of faith that God can do
   no wrong, that he is righteous in all his ways, and just in all his
   works,' Ps. cxlv. 17; and again, Deut. xxxii. 4, He is the rock, his
   work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment and truth, and without
   iniquity; just and right is he.' These are undeniable truths revealed
   in the word of God, and must satisfy us, whatsoever sense saith to the
   contrary. The causes and end of God's particular judgments are
   sometimes secret, but they are always just: Ps. xcvii. 2, Clouds and
   darkness are round about him, but righteousness and truth are the
   habitation of his throne.' Therefore when we see not the reason of
   God's particular dispensations, we must believe the righteousness and
   goodness of them.

   [2.] David knew by his own observation and particular experience: he
   had much studied his own heart, and considered his own ill-deservings
   and soul-distempers, and therefore saw the Lord's discipline was
   necessary for him. We should better understand God's work, and sooner
   justify him both in point of justice and faithfulness, if we did use
   more observation, and did consider what need and profit there is of
   affliction: Tribulation worketh experience,' Rom. v. 4, 5. We see what
   need there was of affliction, and how seasonable the Lord's work was.
   This is a more sensible way of knowledge than the former. Faith is a
   surer ground, but spiritual observation hath its benefit. Natural
   conscience doth represent our guilt, but experience showeth God's
   faithfulness, how seasonably God took us in our month, and suited his
   providence to our present condition.

   Doct. That it would much quiet the minds of the people of God about all
   the sad dispensations of his providence, if they would seriously
   consider the justice and faithfulness of them.

   So did David silence all his murmurings when the hand of God was sore
   upon him; so should we silence all our murmuring, all our suspicions of
   God's dealing, when we are under the cross. I know the Lord doth
   nothing unjust, but is faithful; he will not retract his covenant love,
   and I know his covenant love binds him to lay on us seasonable
   affliction and correction. I shall do two things:--

   First, Illustrate the point by some considerations.

   Secondly, Show that there is much of justice and faithfulness in all
   the troubles and afflictions of God's people.

   Consid. 1. We are not only to grant in the general that God's judgments
   are right, but that he hath in faithfulness afflicted us. So doth
   David, when the stroke of God was heavy upon himself. Many will assert
   the righteousness of God when they speak to others in their
   afflictions, but do not indeed justify him in the afflictions that come
   upon themselves. We are hasty to censure, but backward to humble our
   own souls before God: they will give him the praise of his justice when
   he chasteneth others, but think God dealeth harshly and rigorously with
   them when his scourge is upon their own backs. Such a difference is
   there between knowledge speculative and experimental, between that
   conscience which we have in others' concernments, and that knowledge
   which self-love giveth us in our own. David here doth not only own the
   general truth, but sees God's faithfulness when the stroke lighted upon
   himself. So Job iv. 3-5, you shall see this was objected to Job, that
   he could comfort others, but now the hand of God was upon him, his soul
   fainted. They that stand upon the shore may easily say to those that
   are in the midst of the waves and conflicting for life or death, Sail
   thus. When we are well, we give counsel to the sick; but if we were so,
   how would we take it ourselves? So can we say patiently, All is just,
   and keep silence to God?

   Consid. 2. We must not only grant this truth, that God is faithful,
   when at ease, but when under the sharpest and smartest discipline. We
   use to praise God in prosperity, but we should bless him also when he
   seemeth to deal hardly with us; speak good of God when under the rod.
   When we view a cross at a distance, or in the doctrinal contemplation
   of this truth, we say that God may exercise us with the greatest evil,
   and that we need these methods to bring us to heaven; but when
   afflictions come thick, and near, and close, and we are deprived of our
   nearest and dearest comforts, credit, liberty, health, life, children,
   then we have other thoughts. It is more easy to speak of trouble than
   to bear it. We read of Jesus Christ that he learned by experience, Heb.
   v. 8. He had an actual experience by the things lie suffered; and he
   saith, Now is my soul troubled,' John xii. 27. There is a vast
   difference between the most exact apprehension in the judgment, and the
   experimental feeling of it in the senses: the one may be without so
   much vexation as the other will produce. Though Christ understood
   perfectly what his sufferings should be, and had resolved upon them,
   yet when he came to feel it, his very righteous soul was under
   perplexity, as a glass of pure water may be tossed and shaken.
   Affliction is another thing to present sense and feeling than it is to
   guess and imagination. Much more doth it hold good in us, for we have
   not such a perfect foresight of sufferings as Christ had. We suppose
   they may be avoided, or shifted off one way or other. I speak this that
   we may not depend upon our present resolutions when out of trouble, but
   labour to be more prepared than usually we are, that when trouble
   cometh upon us, we may glorify God.

   Consid. 3. This acknowledgment must be the real language of our hearts,
   and not by word of mouth only: thus we must give unto God the praise of
   his truth and righteousness. We tip our tongues with good words, and
   learn such modesty in our language, as to say God is just, and do not
   rave against his providence in wild and bold speeches; but justice and
   faithfulness must be acknowledged not with the tongue so much as with
   the heart. It is the language of the heart which God looketh after,
   when the soul keepeth silence to God, and a due and suitable impression
   is left upon it of his justice, by a meek and humble submission: Micah
   vii. 9, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, for I have sinned
   against him.' When God is angry, and chastiseth for sin, we must stoop
   humbly under his afflicting hand, bear it patiently and submissively,
   for the rod is dipped in our own guilt; that stoppeth, our mouths and
   checketh repinings. So, seeing his faithfulness, it maketh us accept
   the punishment of our iniquities,' Lev. xxvi. 41, that is, yield to it,
   as a man would to a bitter potion, or a medicinal preparative for his
   health; so to afflict is a means to get rid of sin, which would be the
   bane of the soul.

   Consid. 4. It is not enough to acknowledge justice, but we must also
   acknowledge faithfulness; not only his just severity in the punishments
   of the wicked, but his fidelity and love in the correction of his
   children: it is not enough that we justify God, and forbear to murmur
   against his afflicting us, but we must see his love and faithfulness in
   it, and that he performeth his covenant love. His wisdom and justice,
   that suppresseth murmurings; his love and faithfulness, that giveth
   hope, and comfort, and courage: the one concerneth the honour of God,
   he righteth himself by his just judgments; the other concerneth our
   benefit and eternal welfare. Faithfulness is to us, and for our good.
   Pharaoh could own justice: Exod. ix. 27, The Lord is righteous, but I
   and my people are wicked.' But it is a higher thing to own
   faithfulness; that supposeth faith, as the other doth conviction. Guilt
   will sooner fly in our faces, and extort from us an acknowledgment of
   God's justice, than we can own the grace of the new covenant,
   especially when carnal sense and smart seemeth to speak the contrary.
   The sight of his justice checketh murmurings, the sight of his
   faithfulness fainting and discouragement. God's dispensations are just
   with respect to the sentence of the law, faithful with respect to the
   promises of the gospel. In short, the cause of all affliction is sin,
   therefore justice must be acknowledged; their end is repentance, and
   therefore faithfulness: the end is not destruction and ruin, so they
   might be acts of justice, as upon the wicked; but that we may be fit to
   receive the promises, such to whom God will perform the promise of
   eternal life, and so acts of faithfulness.

   Consid. 5. Faith must fix this as a ground not once to be questioned,
   much less to be doubted of or denied, that God is just, upright, and
   faithful in all his dealings, though weak man be not able to conceive
   the reasons of them. His justice may be dark, as when he permitteth us
   to the will of wicked men, who afflict us without a cause, and lay on
   without any mercy and pity, and God seemeth to befriend their cause, at
   least doth not restrain them, nor give check to their fury. We are apt
   to be tempted to thoughts of rigour and injustice in God's
   dispensations, but we must consider not men's dealing, but God's. It is
   unjust as to men, but we have no cause to be angry with God, and
   complain of God, as if he did not do right No; though we do not see the
   reason of it, yet it is just. God's judgments are a great deep.' We
   should believe the righteousness and goodness of God in the general,
   Ps. xxxvi. 7, before we can find it out. The people of God have
   maintained their principle, when they have been puzzled and embrangled
   in interpreting God's providence: Jer. xii. 1, Righteous art thou, O
   Lord, when I plead with thee;' and Ps. lxxiii. 1, Yet God is good to
   Israel.' In all such cases it is best to acknowledge our own.
   ignorance, and rather accuse ourselves of blindness than God of in
   justice. This is a fixed truth, that God is righteous, though we cannot
   so clearly make it out. And sometimes we are tempted to doubt of his
   fidelity and truth, when we feel nothing but the smart of the rod: the
   benefit is future, not an object of sense, but faith; and it must be
   evident to faith before it is evident to feeling: Heb. xii. 11, No
   affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous; but afterwards
   it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousness.' When all is sharp and
   hard to sense, faith can see all is for our profit, for our good. Here
   is nothing repugnant to God's truth, nothing but what is necessary to
   make good his truth. Faith must determine it to be, when sense will not
   find it so. God's works are misexpounded when we go altogether by
   present sense, whether internal or external: many times we know not
   what God is about to do, as Christ told Peter: John xiii. 7, What I do
   thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.' That which the
   Lord is doing tendeth not to ruin and wrath, though through our
   ignorance and mistake we so interpret it Alas! no wonder we are in the
   dark, when we so judge of his work, who is wonderful in counsel, and
   excellent in working;' who will not always satisfy our sense and
   curiosity, but chooseth such a way as will most suit his intent. But
   ever in all such cases faith must determine that God is just and
   faithful, and will cast all things for the best, though we see it not;
   we must assent by faith, when we cannot find it by sense internal or
   external: I know in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.'

   Secondly, I am to show you, and to prove to you, that there is much of
   justice and faithfulness to be observed in all the afflictions which
   come upon us.

   First, There is much of justice in all God's judgments. I prove it:--

   1. From God's nature: Ps. cxix. 137, Righteous art thou, O Lord, and
   upright are thy judgments;' his work is as his being is, holy and
   righteous; all his providences carry a condecency and becomingness with
   his nature. We presume it of a righteous man that he will do righteous
   things; and shall not we believe so of the holy God? We cannot be
   infallibly persuaded of a righteous man, for a righteous man may leave
   his righteousness, because the creature is mutable; and the most
   righteous and innocent man hath mixed principles, and his rule is
   without him, and sometimes he may hit it, and sometimes swerve from it:
   but God is unchangeable, his will and nature is the supreme reason and
   measure of all things; his acts are accordingly, he cannot err. A
   carpenter who hath a line in his hand may chop right or miss; but if we
   could suppose a carpenter whose hand was his rule, he would always hit
   right. We maybe confident the judge of all the earth will do right; his
   righteousness and the righteousness of men differ infinitely more than
   a candle differeth from the sun: Zeph. iii. 5, The righteous God in the
   midst of thee will do no iniquity.' God will not, yea, he cannot; it is
   contrary to his nature. Abraham might seek to wriggle out of danger by
   a shift, Noah might fall into drunkenness, Lot pollute himself with
   incest, Moses trip in his faith, David destroy his innocent servant
   Uriah, Jonah fall into fear and rash anger, the angels may depart from
   their rule, if the divine goodness should cease to support them for a
   moment; but it is impossible that God, who is holiness and
   righteousness itself, can err and fail in any of his actions.

   2. God never afflicteth or bringeth on judgment without a cause: For
   this cause many are sick,' 1 Cor. xi. 30; there is something done on
   the creature's part before punishment is inflicted. If we consider God
   as the Lord dispensing grace, he acts sovereignly, and according to his
   own will and pleasure: Even so, Father, because it pleaseth thee,' Mat.
   xi. 27, for he may do with his own as he pleaseth; it is no wrong to
   show his grace to some, and pass by others. But if we consider God as a
   judge, he never punisheth without a foregoing cause on the creature's
   part. God, who is arbitrary in his gifts, is not arbitrary in his
   judgments: there is a rule of commerce between him and his creatures,
   stated and set forth, and allowed and appointed by him, and consented
   unto by us: the directive and counselling part is the rule of our
   obedience, and the sanction or comminatory part is the rule of his
   judicial process. In acts of grace, and in dispensing with the
   violations of his law, he sometimes maketh use of his prerogative, but
   not in punishing, there he keepeth to his law; and therefore it is that
   the saints do give him the honour of his justice: Dan. ix. 7, O Lord,
   righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face; for
   we have sinned, and done wickedly, and have rebelled in departing from
   thy precepts:' Neh. ix. 33, Thou art just in all that is brought upon
   us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: all our
   trouble is the penalty of his broken law justly inflicted on us. In
   short, the breach is first on our part, there is some violation of his
   law or contempt of his grace; but God loveth us first, there he hath
   the precedency; he beginneth in all acts of grace, but the reason of
   his judicial dispensations is first with us. We are first in the
   offence, and provide fuel for his wrath before it break out upon us.

   3. When there is cause given, God doth not presently take it, but
   giveth sinners lime in his process against them, and doth not presently
   execute the sentence of his word till they are found incorrigible. He
   giveth them warning before he striketh; he wooeth and soliciteth by
   many kind messages to return to their duty, and speaketh to them
   sometimes in the rough, sometimes in the still voice: He bringeth his
   judgment to light every morning,' as the prophet speaketh, Zeph. iii.
   5; lie doth so delight in mercy, and is so tender of the workmanship of
   his hands, especially his own people, that he never proceedeth to
   severity as long as there is some way unessayed to reclaim them, not
   yet made use of. As one that would open a door, and knows not the key;
   he tries key after key, one dispensation after another; he doth not
   take the sinner at first word, but followeth him with frequent warnings
   of his danger, with offers of advantage if he return; yea, at last he
   is loath to give them up to severe judgments, even then when he can
   scarce without imputation to his holiness forbear any longer: Hosea xi.
   8, How shall I give thee up? I am God, and not man.' Such
   expostulations and speeches are very frequent in the prophets; and all
   these speeches do abundantly justify God when he judgeth: he would fain
   hold off the extremity of judgments deserved by them; the Lord maketh a
   stand, and would fain be prevented before he proceedeth to his strange
   work.

   4. The judgments inflicted are always short of the cause, surely they
   never exceed the value of it: Ezra ix. 13, Thou hast punished us less
   than we have deserved.' God doth not exact the whole debt of sinners
   which they owe to his justice. It was a heavy stroke that then lighted
   upon Jerusalem. Was their wound but a scratch, or affliction little?
   Doleful and sad ruin was brought upon that place, the city and the
   temple burnt to ashes, the people carried captive to a strange land;
   yet Thou hast punished us less than we have deserved.' They were in
   Babylon, they might have been in hell; our reward is always more than
   our desert, but our punishment is always less than our desert. We count
   it a favour if forfeiture of life be punished with banishment, or if a
   sentence of banishment be commuted into a fine, or the fine be
   mitigated and brought lower; and shall we think God dealeth rigorously
   with us? When he layeth on some heavy cross, lie might have cast us
   into hell, and laid his hand upon us for ever. See Job xi. 6, O know,
   therefore, that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity
   deserveth.' We have low thoughts of sin, and therefore have grievous
   apprehensions of God's judgments. We do but sip of the cup, when God
   might make us drink of the dregs of it.

   Secondly, I am to prove that the godly may discern much of faithfulness
   in their afflictions; this will appear to you by these
   considerations:--

   1. In the covenant of grace God hath promised to bestow upon his people
   real and principal mercies; these are promised absolutely, other things
   conditionally. God doth not break his covenant if he doth not give us
   temporal happiness, because that is not absolutely promised, but only
   so far forth as it may be good for us; but eternal life is promised
   without any such exception unto the heirs of promise. Eternal promises
   and threatenings, being of things absolutely good or evil, are
   therefore absolute and peremptory; the righteous shall not fail of the
   reward, nor the wicked escape the punishment; but temporal promises and
   threatenings being of things not simply good or evil, are reserved to
   be dispensed according to God's wisdom and good pleasure, in reference
   and subordination to eternal happiness. It is true it is said, 1 Tim.
   iv. 8, that godliness hath the promise of this life, and that which is
   to come:' but with this reference, that the less gives place to the
   greater; if the promises of this life may hinder us in looking after
   the promises of the life to come, God may take the liberty of the
   cross, and withhold these things, and disappoint us of our worldly
   hope. A man lying under the guilt of sin may many times enjoy worldly
   comforts to the envy of God's children, and one of God's children may
   be greatly afflicted and distressed in the world, for in all these
   dispensations God looketh to his end, which is to make us eternally
   happy.

   2. This being God's end, he is obliged in point of fidelity to use all
   the means that conduce thereunto, that he may attain his eternal
   purpose in bringing his holy ones to glory: Rom. viii. 28, All things
   shall work together for good to them that love God.' Good! what good?
   It may be temporal, so it falls out sometimes a man's temporal good is
   promoted by his temporal loss: Gen. l. 20, Ye thought evil against me,
   but God meant it for good:' they sold their brother a slave, but God
   meant him to be a great potentate in Egypt. It may be spiritual good:
   Ps. cxix. 71, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.' But, to be
   sure, eternal good, to bring about his eternal purpose of making them
   everlastingly happy. And in this sense the apostle saith, All things
   are yours,' 1 Cor. iii. 22. Ordinances, providences, life, death, all
   dispensed with a respect to their final happiness or eternal benefit;
   not only ordinances to work internal grace, but providences as an
   external help and means; for God having set his end, he will prosecute
   it congruously, and as it may agree with man's nature, by external
   providences as well as internal grace. See Ps. cxxv. 3, The rod of the
   wicked shall not always rest upon the back of the righteous.' God hath
   power enough to give them grace to bear it, though the rod had
   continued; and can keep his people from iniquity, though the rod be
   upon them; but he considereth the imbecility of man's nature, which is
   apt to tire under long afflictions, and therefore not only giveth more
   grace, but takes off the temptation. He could humble Paul without a
   thorn in the flesh, 2 Cor. xii. 7, but he will use a congruous means.

   3. Among these means, afflictions, yea, sharp afflictions, are some of
   those things which our need and profit requireth; they are needful to
   weaken and mortify sin: Isa. xxvii. 9, By this shall the iniquity of
   Jacob be purged;' to increase and quicken grace: Heb. xii. 10, But he
   chasteneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
   holiness.' Without this discipline we should forget God and ourselves;
   therefore, that we may return to God, he afflicts us: Hosea v. 15, In
   their afflictions they will seek me early;' and come to ourselves: Luke
   xv. 17, the prodigal came to himself.' Afflictions are necessary for us
   upon the former suppositions, namely, that God hath engaged him self to
   perfect grace where it is begun, and to use all means which may conduce
   to our eternal welfare, that we may not miscarry and come short of our
   great hopes: 1 Cor. xi. 32, When we are judged, we are chastened of the
   Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.' The carnal
   reprobate world are left to a looser and larger discipline. Brambles
   are not pruned when vines are. New creatures require a more close
   inspection than others do. Self-confidence and spiritual security are
   apt to grow upon them; therefore, to mortify our self-confidence, to
   awaken us out of spiritual sleep, we need to be afflicted, and also to
   quicken and rouse up a spirit of prayer. We grow cold and flat, and ask
   mercies for form's sake: Isa. xxvi. 16, Lord, in trouble have they
   visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon
   them.' And that we may be quickened to a greater mindfulness of
   heavenly things. The best of us, when we get a carnal pillow under our
   heads, are apt to sleep secure. God will not let us alone to our ruin,
   but afflicts us that we may be refined from the dregs of the flesh, and
   that our gust and relish of heavenly things may be recovered, and that
   we may be quickened to a greater diligence in the heavenly life. Look,
   as earthly parents are not faithful to their children's souls when they
   live at large, and omit that correction which is necessary for them:
   Prov. xxix. 15, The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to
   himself bringeth his mother to shame.' The mother is mentioned, because
   they are usually more fond and indulgent, and spare many times, and mar
   the child; but our heavenly Father will not be unfaithful, who is so
   wise that he will not be blinded by any passion, hath such a perfect
   love, and does so fixedly design our eternal welfare, that he rebuketh
   that he may reform, and reformeth that he may save.

   4. God's faithfulness about the affliction is twofold--in bringing on
   the affliction, and guiding the affliction.

   [1.] In bringing on the affliction, both as to the time and kind, when
   our need requireth, and such as may do the work: 1 Peter i. 6, Ye are
   in heaviness for a season, if need be.' When some distemper was apt to
   grow upon us, and we were straggling from our duty: Ps. cxix. 67,
   Before I was afflicted I went astray.' Some disappointment and check we
   meet with in a way of sin, which is a notable help in the spiritual
   life, where God giveth a heart to improve it.

   [2.] As to guiding the affliction both to measure and continuance, that
   it may do us good and not harm: 1 Cor. x. 13, God is faithful, who will
   not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able to bear, but will
   with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
   bear it.' Violent temptations are not permitted where the Lord seeth us
   weak and infirm; as Jacob drove as the little ones were able to bear.
   So when the temptation continued is like to do us hurt, either God will
   remove it--2 Thes. iii. 3, Faithful is the Lord, who will establish and
   keep you, apo` tou ponerou, from the evil:' the persecutions of
   unreasonable men are there intended or else support them under it: 2
   Cor. xii. 9, My grace is sufficient for thee.'

   Use 1. To check and reprove divers evils which are apt to grow upon our
   spirits in our troubles.

   1. Murmuring and repining thoughts against God's providence. Why should
   we murmur and complain, since we justly suffer what we suffer, and it
   is the Lord's condescension that he will make some good use of these
   sufferings to our eternal happiness, that we may be capable of
   everlasting consolation? His justice should stop murmurings: Lam. iii.
   39, Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of
   his sins?' If he complain, he can complain of none but himself; that
   evil choice he hath made for his own soul, which it may be he would
   never have thought of but upon this occasion. His punishment here
   carrieth no proportion with his offence; it is punishment in the
   singular number, sins in the plural; one punishment for many acts of
   sin: and a living man, on this side hell, what is this to everlasting
   torments? Life cannot be without many blessings to accompany it; while
   living we may see an end of this misery, or have time to escape those
   eternal torments which are far worse. The form of the words showeth why
   we should thus expostulate with ourselves, Wherefore doth a living man
   complain?' Why do we complain? God hath not cut us off from the land of
   the living, nor cast us into hell; it is the punishment of sin, and is
   far less than we have deserved. Again, the faithfulness of God checketh
   murmurings. God knoweth what way to take with us to bring us to glory;
   therefore trust yourselves in God's hands, and let him take his own
   methods: Commit your souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
   creator,' 1 Peter iv. 19. He is pisto`s kti'stes; as he is a creator,
   he doth not love to destroy the work of his hands; as he is faithful in
   his covenant, he will take the best and safest course to bring you to
   heaven.

   2. Let it check immoderate sorrow and uncomely dejection of spirit; he
   is just in the afflictions of his people, but yet so that he is also
   faithful; he is a father when he beateth and indulgeth, when he smiles
   and when he frowns. Afflictions do not make void our adoption, they
   rather increase our confidence of it, Heb. xii. 5. Whatever we do upon
   other reasons, we should not suspect his love because of our
   afflictions. God's strokes do not make void his promises, nor doth he
   retract his gift of pardon when he chastiseth. Mere crosses and
   troubles are not an argument of God's displeasure, but acts of his
   faithfulness; so that we have reason to give thanks for his discipline,
   rather than question his love. In the book of Job it is made a mark of
   his love, as in those words which are so frequent, Job vii. 17, 18,
   What is man that thou art mindful of him? that thou chastiseth him
   every morning, and triest him every moment?' We are not only beneath
   his anger, but unworthy of his care, as if a prince should take upon
   him to form the manners of a beggar's child; it is a condescension that
   the great God should deal with us, and suit his providences for our
   good.

   3. This should check our fears and cares; his judgments are right and
   full of faithfulness; he will bear us through all our trials, and make
   an advantage of them, and perfect that grace which he hath begun, and
   finally bring us to eternal glory. The Lord's faithfulness in keeping
   promises is often propounded as a strong pillar of the saints'
   confidence: 1 Cor. i. 9, Faithful is God, by whom ye are called;' 1
   Thes. v. 24, Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.' He
   dispenseth all things with respect to our eternal welfare. But I am
   afraid of myself; I have provoked the Lord to leave me to myself; but
   the Lord will pardon weaknesses when they are confessed: 1 John i. 9,
   If we confess our sins, he is just and faithful to forgive them,'
   speaking to reconciled believers; and when we fall, the Lord hath ways
   and means to raise us up again, that we perish not; by checks of
   conscience: 2 Sam. xxiv. 10, And David's heart smote him when he had
   numbered the people;' Ps. cxix. 59, I thought on my ways,' &c.; by the
   word, as Nathan roused up David, Thou art the man.' God, that foresaw
   all things, hath ordered them so that nothing shall cross his eternal
   purpose and promise made to us in Christ.

   Use 2. Let us acknowledge God's justice and faithfulness in all things
   that befall us. For motives, consider--

   1. It is much for the honour of God, Ps. li. 4, that, under the cross,
   we should have good thoughts of God, and clear him in all that he saith
   and doth, see love in his rebukes.

   2. It is for our profit; it is the best way to obtain grace to bear
   afflictions, or to get deliverance out of them. When God hath humbled
   his people, exercised their grace, he will restore to them their wonted
   privileges; he waiteth for the creatures' humbling, Lev. xxvi. 41, 42.

   For means:--

   [1.] You must be one in covenant with God, for to them the
   dispensations of God come marked not only with justice, as to all, but
   faithfulness: Ps. xxv. 10 All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth
   to them that keep his covenant.'

   [2.] You must examine yourselves; the Lord complains of the neglect of
   this, that when they were in affliction they would not consider: Jer.
   viii. 6, No man said, What have I done?' If you would consider, you
   would see cause enough to justify God: Lam. iii. 39, 40, Wherefore doth
   a living man complain? Let us search and try our ways, and turn to the
   Lord.'

   [3.] You must observe providence, and your hearts must be awake and
   attend to it: Ps. cvii. 43, Whoso is wise, and will observe these
   things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord;'
   Eccles. vii. 14, In the day of adversity consider.'

   [4.] You must be such as value not your happiness by the increase or
   decrease of worldly comforts, but by the increase or decrease of grace
   in your souls: 2 Cor. iv. 16, For this cause we faint not, because,
   though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by
   day.' If you value yourselves by your outward condition, you will still
   be imbrangled; you should more highly esteem of and be more solicitous
   about the welfare of your souls in a time of affliction than of all
   things else in the world: and you will more easily submit and more
   wisely consider of his doing, and the better understand your interest.
   When the main care is about your souls, you will value other losses the
   less, as long as your jewel is in safe hands.

   [5.] You must resign your souls to God entirely without exception,
   refer yourselves to his methods, and let him take his own way to bring
   you to everlasting glory. When you do with quietness of heart put
   yourselves into God's hands, as being persuaded of his love and
   faithfulness, you will be the sooner satisfied in God's providence,
   seeing he doth all things well. The apostle bids them, 1 Peter iv. 19,
   put your souls in Christ's hands, and hold on your duty with courage
   and confidence, cheerfully and constantly. You have no reason to doubt
   but Christ will take the custody and charge of the soul that is
   committed to him: 2 Tim. i. 12, I know whom I have believed, that he is
   able to keep that I have committed to him.' Venture your souls in this
   bottom; he hath power to keep it, he hath pawned his faithfulness in
   the promise.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXXXIV.

   Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to
   thy word unto thy servant.--Ver. 76.

   IN the foregoing verse he had acknowledged that God had afflicted him,
   and now he prayeth that God would comfort him. The same hand that
   woundeth must heal, and from whom we have our affliction we must have
   our comfort: Hosea vi. 1, Come, let us return unto the Lord; for he
   hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us
   up.' Affliction is God's judicial act, a kind of putting the creature
   in prison; which being done by the supreme judge, who hath an absolute
   power to save and to destroy, to ruin or pardon, there is no breaking
   prison or getting out without his leave.

   He doth there not only speak of affliction, but of the justice and
   faithfulness which God showed in it.

   1. Justice. Those that humbly confess the justice of his strokes may
   with the more confidence implore his mercy. Judgment hath done its work
   when the creature is humble and penitent, There lieth an appeal then
   from the tribunal of his justice to the throne of his grace. Though our
   sins deserve affliction, yet there is comfort in the merciful nature of
   God and the promises of the gospel. David first acknowledgeth that he
   was justly afflicted, and then he flieth to mercy and beggeth comfort.

   2. He observeth also a faithfulness in all God's dispensations; he doth
   not afflict his children to destroy them, but to prepare them for the
   greater comfort. As one of his children and servants, David sueth out
   his privilege. God, that is just and true, will also be kind and
   merciful. To have judgment without mercy, and desolation without
   consolation, is the portion of the wicked: but, Lord, saith he, I am
   thy servant,' therefore I pray thee let thy merciful kindness be for my
   comfort.'

   So that you see this request is fitly grafted upon the former
   acknowledgment. In it observe--

   1. The original cause of all the good which we expect, thy merciful
   loving-kindness.

   2. The effect now sued for, be for my comfort, or to comfort me.

   3. The instrument or means of obtaining it, which is double:--

   [1.] On God's part, the word, according to thy word.

   [2.J On our part, prayer, let, I pray thee.

   (1.) In the word there is the relief discovered and offered, and
   thereby we are encouraged and assured.

   (2.) On our part there is prayer, in which we act faith and spiritual
   desire.

   (3.) We have hope given in the word, and we sue it out by prayer.

   (4.) The subject capacitated to receive this effect, from that cause,
   in this order, thy servant.

   Doct. That the people of God have liberty, and much encouragement from
   God's merciful nature and promises, to ask comfort in their
   afflictions.

   This point will be best discussed by going over the parts and branches
   of the text as they have been laid forth to you.

   First, The primary and principal cause of all comfort is the merciful
   kindness of God. We read in 2 Cor. i. 3, that he is the father of
   mercies;' and then it presently followeth, that he is the God of all
   comfort.' The remedy of all our evils lieth in the mercy of God, and
   his kindness and goodness is the fountain of all our blessedness. I
   shall inquire--

   1. What his merciful kindness is.

   2. What special encouragement this is to the people of God.

   1. What his merciful kindness is. You see here is a compound word,
   which importeth both his pity and his bounty. Here is merci fulness and
   kindness mentioned. First, His mercifulness. Mercy hath its name from
   misery. Misericordia is nothing else but the laying of the misery of
   others to heart, with intention of affording them relief and succour.
   In God it noteth his readiness to do good to the miserable,
   notwithstanding sin. The motion cometh from within, from his own breast
   and bowels: for our God is pitiful and of tender mercy,' James v. 11;
   and the act of it is extended and reached out unto the creature in
   seasonable relief, for the throne of grace was erected for this
   purpose, Heb. iv. 11. Two things there are in mercy--(1.) A propension
   and inclination to commiserate the afflicted; (2.) A ready relief and
   succour of them according to our power, affectus et effectus. (1.)
   There is a compassion or being affected with the misery of others. This
   properly cannot be in God, in whom as there is no passion, so strictly
   speaking there is no compassion. Yet some thing analogous there is, a
   taking notice of our misery, something like a pity arising in his heart
   upon the sight of it, which the scripture frequently ascribeth to God,
   and we can best understand as we consider the divine perfections
   shining forth in the human nature of Christ: Exod. ii. 24, he heard
   their groaning:' and Isa. lxiii. 9, In all their afflictions he was
   afflicted:' Judges x. 16, His soul was grieved for the misery of
   Israel:' forms of speech taken from the manner of men, who use to be
   thus affected when they see a miserable object. God in his simple and
   perfect nature cannot be said either to joy or grieve, but he carrieth
   himself as one thus affected. Or these expressions were laid in
   aforehand to suit with the divine perfections ns manifested in Christ,
   who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities. (2.) Mercy noteth the
   actual exhibition of help and relief to the miserable. When his people
   cry to him, he runneth to the cry: Ps. lxxviii. 38, He being full of
   compassion, forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not; yea, many a
   time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.'
   Mark, there God's forgiving the iniquity was not inflicting the
   temporal punishment or destroying the sinner presently; the cause of
   all was not any good in the sinner, but pity in God, that moved him to
   spare them for the time. So he doth sometimes for those that cry to him
   but in a natural manner, as a beast maketh its moan when it is in pain.
   But much more will his compassion show itself to his people, when they
   bemoan themselves in a spiritual manner: Jer. xxxi. 18, 20, I have
   heard Ephraim bemoaning himself.' What then? My bowels are troubled for
   him, I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.' When Ephraim
   was bewailing his sins, God taketh notice of it, and returneth an
   answer full of fatherly affection, that he would surely show him mercy.
   God's compassion proceedeth from love as the cause, and produceth
   relief as the effect. Secondly, the next word is kindness; that noteth
   the bounty of God, or his free inclination to do good without our
   merit, and against our merit. The cause is not in us, but himself. We
   draw an ill picture of God in our minds, as always angry and ready to
   destroy. No; the Lord is kind, and that many times to the unthankful
   and to the evil,' Luke vi. 35. We should all enlarge our thoughts more
   about God's merciful nature, that we may love him more, that we may not
   keep off from him. As long as we think he delighteth in the creature's
   misery, or seeketh occasions of man's ruin and destruction, God is made
   hateful. No; you must conceive of him as one that is kind, that doth
   not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men,' Lam. iii. 33,
   but is ready to do good upon all occasions. We need not fear any hurt
   from God, but what we willingly bring upon ourselves. He destroyeth not
   humble souls that lie at his feet, and would have mercy upon his own
   terms.

   2. What encouragement this is to the people of God.

   [1.] It is an encouragement, because the object of mercy is misery.
   Mercy is favour shown to a miserable person. Now, the more sense of our
   misery, especially of our true misery, which is sin, the greater hopes.
   So that the broken-hearted are more capable of his mercy than others
   are. God will revive the spirit of the contrite ones,' Isa. lvii.
   15-17. He taketh care to comfort them and to look after them, whatever
   be neglected, Isa. lx. 2. None are so apt to presume of mercy as the
   careless, nor none less capable of mercy, or more deserve judgment.
   While we make nothing of sin it is easy to believe mercy. In a time of
   peace sin is nothing, vanity and carnality nothing, a negligent course
   of profession nothing, vain talk, idle mis-spence of time, pleasing the
   flesh with all it craveth is nothing, and there needeth no such
   niceness and strictness--God is merciful; but when the conscience is
   awakened, and we see our actions with their due aggravations,
   especially at the hour of death, and when earthly comforts fail, then
   it is hard to believe God's mercy. Sin is a blacker thing than they did
   imagine, and they find it another manner of thing than ever they
   thought of; and the same unbelief that now weakens their faith about
   their duty, and what belongeth to their duty, doth now weaken their
   faith about their comfort, and what belongeth to their comfort. Those
   that now question precepts will then question promises. Well, then, the
   careless and negligent are not capable objects of the tenders of mercy;
   but the sensible, and the contrite, and the serious, these are the
   fittest objects, though they think themselves farthest off from mercy.
   Those that have a deep sense of their own unworthiness most see a need
   of mercy, and most admire mercy, Gen. xxxii. 10. They see that mercy
   doth all, that there is somewhat of the pity and kindness of God in all
   things vouchsafed. They apprehend they are always in some necessity, or
   in some dependence, and they are unworthy, and that it is at God's
   mercy to continue or take away any comfort they have. Health, liberty,
   strength, all is dipped in mercy, continued in mercy, restored at
   mercy.

   [2.] It is an encouragement to us, because the scripture saith so much
   of this mercy in God. Id agit iota scriptura, ut credamus in Deum,
   saith Luther. It is natural to him: 1 Cor. i. 3, The father of
   mercies,' not pater ultionum, but misericordiarum; he is as just as he
   is merciful, but he delighteth in the exercise of one attribute more
   than the other--Micah vii. 18, the other his strange work.' There is a
   fulness and plenty, abundant mercy, 1 Peter i. 3; and Ps. li. 1,
   According to the multitude of thy tender mercies.' Our wants are many,
   and so are our sins; only plentiful mercy can supply and overcome them.
   They are tender mercies, compared with those of a father and a mother.
   Of a father: Ps. ciii. 13, As a father pitieth his children, so doth
   the Lord pity those that fear him.' We need not much entreat a father
   to pity his child in misery. An earthly father may be ignorant of our
   misery, as Jacob in Joseph's case: an earthly father pitieth foolishly,
   but God wisely, when it is most for our benefit; an. earthly father's
   pity may go no further than affection, and cannot always help his
   children and relieve their misery. But God, as he is metaphorically
   said to have the affection, so he hath an all-sufficient power to
   remove any evil present, or avert that which is imminent. With that of
   a mother: Isa. xlix. 15, Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she
   should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may
   forget, yet I will not forget thee,' saith the Lord. In the general,
   passions in females are more vehement, especially in human creatures;
   the mother expresseth the greatest tenderness and largeness of love.
   God hath the wisdom of a father and bowels of a mother. Mark, it is not
   to an adopted child, but to her own son, her sucking child that hangeth
   on her breast, cannot subsist without the mother's care. Mothers are
   wont to be most chary and tenderly affected towards them, poor helpless
   infants and children, that cannot shift for themselves; nature hath
   impressed this disposition on them. Suppose some of them should be so
   unnatural as to forget their sucking babes, which is a case rare to be
   found, yet I will not forget you,' saith the Lord. They are durable
   compassions: His compassions fail not,' Lam. iii. 22. They are
   continual mercies, supplying daily wants, pardoning daily failings,
   bestowing daily mercies. Oh, that the miserable and the wretched, those
   that find themselves so, could believe this and plead this, and cast
   themselves in the arms of this merciful Father! Surely the penitent are
   not more ready to ask than he to give: Therefore let us come boldly to
   the throne of grace,' Heb. iv. 16. Let not our sins keep us from him;
   our misery rather than our worthiness is an object of his mercy.

   [3.] His mercy is more to his people than to others. There is a general
   mercy and a special mercy. (1.) There is a general mercy by which God
   sustaineth and helpeth any creature that is in misery, especially man:
   so Christ calleth him merciful as he showeth himself kind to the
   unthankful and evil,' Luke vi. 36. Had it not been for this mercy the
   world had been long since reduced into its ancient chaos, and the frame
   of nature dissolved. (2.) There is a special mercy which he showeth to
   his people, pardoning their sins, sanctifying their hearts, accepting
   their persons. So of his mercy hath he saved us,' Titus iii. 4, 5;
   Quickened us;' Eph. ii. 4, 5, God, who is rich in mercy, for his great
   love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath
   quickened us together with Christ.' This showeth God hath more mercy
   for his people than for others. Now this is a great encouragement, he
   that took pity upon us in our lost estate, and did then pardon our sins
   freely, will he not take pity upon us now we are in a state of grace,
   and have our sins pardoned? Surely he will show mercy unto us still in
   forbearing the punishment due unto us, or in mitigating his
   corrections, or sweetening them with his love. What matter is it who
   hateth us, when the Almighty pitieth us, and is so tender over us?

   Secondly, The satisfying effect, which is comfort. Here I shall show--

   1. What is comfort.

   2. That consolation is the gift and proper work of God, to be asked of
   him.

   1. What is comfort. It is sometimes put for the object or thing
   comfortable. Sometimes for the disposition of the subject, or that
   sense and apprehension that we have of it.

   [1.] The object or thing comfortable, and so comfort may note:--(1.)
   Deliverance and temporal blessings. These things are comfort able Jo
   the senses, and in a moderate proportion and with submission they maybe
   asked of God. That comfort is put for deliverance many scriptures
   witness. Take these for a taste: Ps. lxxi. 21, After deep and sore
   troubles thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every
   side:' so Ps. lxxxvi. 17, Show me a token for good, that they which
   hate me may see it and be ashamed; because thou Lord hast holpen me and
   comforted me:' so Isa. xii. 1, In that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I
   will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger was
   turned away, and thou comfortedst me.' In all these places comfort is
   put for temporal deliverance, which is an effect of God's mercy, and
   may be an object of the saints' prayers. It is lawful to deprecate
   afflictions. There are but few of the best of God's children that can
   hold out under long troubles without murmuring or fainting. (2.)
   Another object of comfort is the pardon of sins, or a sense of God's
   special love in Christ, wrought on our hearts. This is matter of
   comfort indeed. This is the principal effect of God's merciful kindness
   in this life, and the great consolation of the saints, as offering a
   remedy against our greatest evil, which is trouble that ariseth from
   guilt and sin. This obtained filleth them with joy and peace, Ps. iv,
   6, 7, Puts gladness into our hearts.' To feel God's love in the soul,
   Rom. v. 5, is the heaven upon earth which a believer enjoyeth, which
   allayeth the bitterness of all his troubles. Heaven above is nothing
   but comfort, and the comforts of the Spirit are heaven below. God
   keepeth not all for the life to come. (3.) Another object of comfort is
   our happy estate in heaven, which puts an end to all our miseries: Rev.
   vii. 19, God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes:' Rev. xxi. 4,
   There shall he no more death nor sorrow, nor crying nor any pain:' Luke
   xvi. 19, In thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus
   evil things; but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.' We have
   not our full comfort till we come to heaven. In the world there still
   is day and night, summer and winter; here is a mixture of mourning and
   joy, but there all comfort, Mat. v. 4. (4.) The highest and chiefest
   object of our comfort is the Lord himself: 1 Sam. xxx. 6, David
   comforted himself in the Lord his God.' Though all things else fail,
   this should satisfy us. Though we have little health, no friends, no
   outward supports to rejoice in, yet thou hast God, whose favour is
   life, and who is the fountain of happiness, and the centre of the
   soul's rest. The prophet, when reduced not only to some straits but
   great exigencies: Hab. iii. 18, Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will
   joy in the God of my salvation.' The joy of sense is in the creature,
   the joy of faith is in God. Thus we may consider comfort objectively.
   All that I shall say further is this, that we should take heed what we
   make to be the object of our solid comfort, Luke x. 24. They are carnal
   men that wholly place their comfort in earthly things, in the
   pleasures, and honours, and profits of the world: Luke vi. 24, Woe to
   you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.' They have
   all here, and can look for no more, and if disappointed here, they are
   utterly miser able. There are consolations arising from good things
   exhibited, but more in good things promised. Everlasting consolations,'
   2 Thes. ii. 16.

   [2.] Let us consider it subjectively. Comfort is the strengthening of
   the mind when it is apt to be weakened by doubts, fears, and sorrows.
   As by patience we are kept from murmuring, so by comfort we are kept
   from fainting. It is the strength, stay, and support of the heart
   against any grievance whereby it is likely to be overcome. There are
   three words by which that delightful sense of God's favour as a stay
   and strengthening to the heart is expressed--comfort, peace, and joy.
   (1.) Comfort is that sense of his love by which the sorrows that arise
   from the sense of sin and the fears of God's justice are not altogether
   removed and taken away, yet so mitigated and allayed that the soul is
   not overwhelmed by them, but hope doth more prevail. This is the nature
   of comfort, that it doth not altogether remove the evil, but so
   alleviate and assuage it, that we are able to bear it with some
   alacrity and cheerfulness: and this is the common state of believers,
   answerable to the ordinary measure of faith which God giveth his
   children. Though they are assaulted with sorrows, doubts, and fears,
   yet they have that true and solid ground of comfort in the promises
   which begets some hope and expectation towards God; and when the
   conflict groweth grievous, God of his mercy allayeth the storm by the
   working of his comforting Spirit. (2.) There is peace, which is another
   notion which implieth comfort, but withal a more full degree of it; for
   peace doth so settle and calm the conscience, that they are assaulted
   either with none or very light fears. It may be explained by external
   peace. External peace is that state of things which is not troubled
   with wars from abroad, or intestine tumults and confusions at home, for
   some long space of time. A truce is a shorter respite, but a peace is a
   long calm and quiet. So when we are not assaulted with doubts and
   troubles, but have much peace and quietness of spirit in believing:
   Rom. xv. 13, Now the God of all hope fill you with all joy and peace in
   believing.' (3.) As peace exceedeth consolation, so doth joy exceed
   peace, and beget a more notable sense of itself in the soul. In peace
   all things are quiet, so as we feel no anxious tossings of mind, no
   gripes and fears of an accusing conscience; but in joy, true joy, more,
   some lively motions of heart accompanied with a more lively pleasure
   and delight. In peace the soul is in such a condition as the body is
   when nothing paineth us: but in joy,--as when the corporeal senses are
   mightily moved with such things as delight and please them, as at a
   feast,--the soul is filled with perpetual suavities, so great many
   times as cannot be told: 1 Peter i. 8, Joy unspeakable and full of
   glory.'

   Well, then, this is comfort, if you consider it with respect to the
   sense of God's love, or the hopes of glory; such a lightening and
   easing of the heart as showeth itself in alacrity in God's service, and
   courage in tribulations.

   1. These comforts, though not absolutely necessary to salvation, yet
   conduce much to the well-being of a Christian, and therefore are not to
   be despised. It is as oil to the wheels, Job xv. 11. If neglected and
   not sought after with earnest diligence, they are despised, which
   cannot be without great sin.

   2. It follows after holiness, as heat doth fire. The oil of grace will
   breed the oil of gladness. There are certain spiritual pleasures which
   do attend a course of obedience. Holiness is our work, comfort our
   reward; holiness is God's due, comfort our profit and interest: Acts
   ix. 31, Walked in the fear of God and comfort of the Holy Ghost.' Grace
   carrieth us out to honour God, love to him breedeth comfort. It is
   strange if it be not so; there is some unusual impediment.

   3. Though our main comfort be in heaven, yet whilst we are here in the
   world we have some foregoing consolation, as an earnest and pledge of
   more to ensue, and as the solace of our pilgrimage, Ps. cxvii. 54. Here
   is not only the offer, but the sealing of pardon and peace to the soul.

   4. Comfort is more needful at some time than at others, and God
   dispenseth it suitably to our trials, necessities, and wants. In great
   afflictions and temptations there is a larger allowance, because they
   need greater comforts, 2 Cor. i. 5; a drop of honey is not enough to
   sweeten a hogshead of vinegar. The Lord reserveth the comforts of his
   Spirit for such a time. The more humble and frequent in prayer, grace
   is more exercised, drawn forth into the view of conscience.

   2. Comfort is to be asked of God, for it is his proper gift. It is his
   name: The God of all comfort,' 2 Cor i. 3; and 2 Cor. vii. 6, The God
   that comforteth those that are cast down.' It is well that our comforts
   are in the hand of God; we should have little of it if it were in the
   disposal of the creature.

   Consider:--

   1. That natural comforts are the gifts of God: 1 Tim. i. 17, He giveth
   us richly all things to enjoy,' and sets forth the bounds of our
   habitation, where and how much we shall have, and giveth and taketh
   these things at his pleasure, raising up some from the dunghill,
   pulling down others from the throne of glory, 1 Sam. ii. 7, 8. That
   prosperity may never be without a curb, nor adversity without a
   comfort, God will acquaint the world with such spectacles now and then:
   all things are at his dispose.

   2. That moderate delight and contentment that we have in our earthly
   blessings is his allowance. The creature without God is like a
   deaf-nut; when we crack it, we find nothing, Eccles. ii. 24, 25, and
   Eccles. iii. 13. It is the gift of God, and it is one of the chiefest
   earthly mercies, that in this valley of tears, where we meet with so
   many causes of grief and sorrow, we take comfort in anything. Without
   this, a crown of gold will sit no easier than a crown of thorns upon
   the head of him that weareth it; yea, a palace becomes a prison, and
   every place a hell to us. It is not abundance of honour that makes a
   man happy, but comfort, Luke xii. 15. If God send leanness into the
   soul, or a spark of his wrath into the conscience, all is as the white
   of an egg, unsavoury. A secret curse eateth out all the contentment of
   it. He that liveth in a cottage is happier than he that liveth in a
   palace, if he have comfort there.

   3. For spiritual comfort, which ariseth either from the sense of his
   love, or the hope of glory, we cannot have one drop of it but from God.
   His Spirit is called the comforter.' All the world cannot give it if he
   doth not give it us: he hath an immediate and sovereign power over the
   hearts of men; if he frown, nothing can support us. When the sun is
   gone, all the candles in the world cannot make it day. We can procure
   our own sorrows quickly, but he only can comfort us. None but divine
   comforts are authentic.

   Thirdly, The means of conveying and procuring this comfort 1. The means
   of conveying it on God's part is his word. David pleadeth that where
   the remedy of his misery was discovered and offered. We read often in
   this psalm how David revived his comfort by the word; and Rom. xv. 4,
   Comfort of the scriptures.' There is the matter of true spiritual
   comfort: 1 Cor. xiv. 31, That all may learn and all be comforted.' This
   follows from the former; God is the God of comfort, and we should not
   have the heart to come to him unless he had opened the way to him by
   his promise. The world cannot give it to us; philosophy cannot. The
   word of God can. And this comfort is both strong and full, for measure
   and matter. Matter; there the death of Christ is laid down as the
   foundation of comfort. If we consider God as holiness itself, and we
   nothing but a mass of sin and corruption, you will see there can be no
   reconciliation without satisfaction given. Mercy must see justice
   contented; one attribute must not destroy another. Justice hath no
   loss, it is fully satisfied in Christ, and that is the ground of our
   comfort, 2 Cor. i. 3. There are the promises of deliverance,
   protection, support, the liberties and privileges of Christians laid
   forth. These are the breasts of comfort, Isa. lxvi.; suck of these and
   be satisfied. In short, our great comforts are, God's presence with us
   while we are in these houses of clay, our presence with God in his
   palace of glory: 1 Thes. iv. 17, 18, We shall ever be with the Lord;'
   and Comfort one another with these words.'

   2. The means on our part, receiving the sweet effects of God's mercy
   and word, and that is prayer. We cannot have it without dealing with
   God in a humble manner. Whatever God giveth he will have it sought out
   this way; Ezek. xxxvi. 37, I will yet be inquired after to do it for
   them;' so Isa. xxix. 10, 11. Now the reasons are these:--

   [1.] Because in prayer we act faith and spiritual desire, both which
   are as the opening of the soul, Ps. lxxxi. 10, to raise our confidence,
   or draw forth the principles of trust.

   [2.] We ask God's leave to apply in particular what is offered in the
   word in general: as in the next verse, Let thy tender mercies come unto
   me,' ver. 77. In everything we must ask God's leave though we have
   right; though in possession we ask leave, because we may be mistaken in
   our claim.

   [3.] It is a fit way of easing the heart and disburthening ourselves,
   Phil. iv. 6, 7. When we pray most, and most ardently, we are most happy
   and find greatest ease.

   [4.] God will be owned as the author of comfort, whoever be the
   instrument, Isa. lvii. 19; in prayer we apply ourselves to him. The
   word is a sovereign plaster, but God's hand maketh it stick; many read
   the scriptures, but are as dead-hearted when done as when they began.
   The Spirit is the comforter; we are very apt to look to the next hand,
   to the comfort, but not to the comforter, or the root of all, which is
   loving-kindness in God.

   Fourthly, The subject capable, thy servant.' Here we may ask the
   eunuch's question, Of whom speaketh the prophet this, of himself or of
   some other man?' Of himself questionless, under the denomination of
   God's servant. But then the question returneth, Is it a word of promise
   made to himself in particular, or God's servants in the general? Some
   say the former, 2 Sam. xii. 13, the promises brought to him by Nathan.
   I incline to the latter, and it teacheth us these three truths:--(1.)
   That God's servants are only capable of the sweet effects of his mercy
   and the comfort of his promises. Who are God's servants? (1st.) Such as
   own his right, and are sensible of his interest in them: Acts xxiii.
   23, The God whose I am and whom I serve.' (2d.) Such as give up
   themselves to him, renouncing all other masters. Renounce we must, for
   we were once under another master, Rom. vi. 17; Mat. vi. 24; Rom. vi.
   13; 1 and Chron. xxx. 8. (3d.) Accordingly frame themselves to do his
   work sincerely: Rom. i. 9, Serve with my spirit;' and Rom. vii. 6, In
   newness of spirit,' so as will become those who are renewed by the
   Spirit: diligently, Acts xxvi. 7, and universally, Luke i. 74, and wait
   upon him for grace to do so, Heb. xi. 28. These are capable of comfort.
   The book of God speaketh no comfort to persons that live in sin, but to
   God's servants, such as do not live as if they were at their own
   dispose, but at God's beck: if he say, Go, they go. They give up
   themselves to be and do what God will have them to be and do. (2.) If
   we would have the benefit of the promise, we must thrust in ourselves,
   under one title or other, among those to whom the promise is made, if
   _not as God's children, yet as God's servants. Then it is as sure as if
   our name were in the promise. (3.) All God's servants have common
   grounds of comfort: every one of God's servants may plead with God as
   David doth. The comforts of the word are the common portion of God's
   people; they that bring a larger measure of faith, carry away a larger
   measure of comfort.

   Oh, then, let us lift up our eyes and hearts to God this day, and, in
   as broken-hearted a manner, seek this comfort as possibly we can!
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LXXXV.

   Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my
   delight.--Ver. 77.

   THE man of God had begged mercy before, now he beggeth mercy again. The
   doubling the request showeth that he had no light feeling of sin in the
   troubles that were upon him; and besides, the people of God think they
   can never have enough of mercy, nor beg enough of mercy; they again and
   again reinforce their suits, and still cry for mercy. After he had
   said, Let thy merciful loving-kindness be for my comfort,' he presently
   addeth, Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live.'

   In the words we have two things:--

   1. His request, let thy tender mercies come unto me.

   2. A reason to back it, that I may live.

   First, The request consists of three branches:--

   1. The cause and fountain, let thy tender mercies.

   2. The influence and outgoing of that cause, or the personal
   application of it to David, let them come unto me.

   3. The end, that I may live.

   1. The cause and fountain is the Lord's tender mercies: it is
   remarkable that in this and the former verse he doth not mention mercy
   without some additament; there it was merciful kindness, here tender
   mercy. Mercy in men implieth a commotion of the bowels at the sight of
   another's misery; so in God there is such a readiness to pity, as if he
   had the same working of bowels: Jer. xxxi. 20, My bowels are troubled
   for him,' or sound for him. Now some are more apt to feel this than
   others, according to the goodness of their nature, or their special
   interest in the party miserable. We expect from parents that their
   bowels should yearn more towards their own children than to strangers;
   so God hath the bowels of a father: Ps. ciii. 13, Like as a father
   pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.' There
   needeth not much ado to bring a father to pity his children in misery,
   if he hath anything fatherly in him.

   2. The outgoing of this mercy is begged, Let it come unto me;' where,
   by a fiction of persons, mercy is said to come or find out its way to
   him.

   3. The effect, That I may live.' Life is sometimes taken literally,
   and, in its first sense, for life natural, spiritual, or eternal, by a
   metonymy for joy, peace, comfort: now which of these senses shall we
   apply to this place? Some take it for life natural, that he might
   escape the death his enemies intended to him. Certainly in the former
   verse he speaketh as a man under deep troubles and afflictions, and in
   the following words he telleth us that the proud dealt perversely with
   him, and therefore he might have some apprehensions of dying in his
   troubles, which he beggeth God to prevent. Some think he beggeth God's
   mercy to preserve him in life spiritual, and Bellarmine understandeth
   it of life eternal. But I rather take it in the latter sense, for joy
   and comfort, which is the result of life, where it is vital and in its
   perfection. Non est vivere sed valere vita. 1 Thes. iii. 8, We live, if
   ye stand fast in the truth.' A man that enjoy eth himself is said to
   live. But if we take it in this notion, a double sense may be started;
   for it may imply either a release from temporal sorrows, and so the
   sense will be, Have pity upon me, that I may once more see good and
   comfortable days in the world, for a life spent in sorrow is as no
   life. Or, he putteth life for some comfortable sense of God's mercy, or
   assurance of his love to him. Most interpreters, both ancient and
   modern, go this way. Ne'kron eauto`n egeitai tes thei'as estereme'non
   eumenei'as, saith Theodoret. He counted himself but as a dead man
   without the sense of God's favour and good-will to him, but it would be
   as a new life or resurrection from the dead if God would show him
   mercy, and cast a favourable aspect upon him. This sense suiteth well
   with the context, for David was for the present deprived of the tokens
   and effects of God's tender mercy; why else should he so earnestly beg
   for that to come to him which he had already; and it suiteth well with
   a gracious spirit such as David had.

   The points are:--

   1. That God's tender mercy is the fountain of his people's comfort and
   happiness.

   2. That it is not enough to hear somewhat of the mercy of God, but we
   should by all means seek that it may come unto us.

   3. That it is life to a believer to have a sense of God's mercy and
   love in Christ, and death to be without it.

   4. Such as would taste or have a sense of God's mercy must delight in
   his law. This was David's plea.

   The two last propositions I shall insist upon, the other being handled
   elsewhere, and so much consideration of them as is necessary for the
   opening and improving of this verse will occur in one or both of these
   points.

   That it is life to a believer to have a sense of God's mercy and love
   in Christ, and death to be without it.

   David was a dead man because he felt not God's mercy as formerly: he
   did eat, and drink, and sleep, and transact his business as others did;
   but he counted this as no life, because he felt not the wonted sense of
   God's love. Gracious spirits cannot live without divine comforts, they
   take no joy in the world unless God favourably look upon them.

   Let me illustrate this note with these observations:--

   1. Observe, he seeketh all his comfort from mercy, and tender mercy; so
   in the former, so in the present verse. I shall show you the necessity
   and utility of so doing.

   [1.] The necessity of it. The best of God's children have no other
   claim. For a publican to come and say, God, be merciful to me a
   sinner,' Luke xviii. 13, is no such wonder; but for a David to use the
   same plea, that should be noted. From first to last the children of God
   have no other claim; it is mere mercy that took us into a state of
   grace at first, and mere mercy that keepeth us in it, and furnisheth us
   with all the supplies that are necessary to keep it up in vigour and
   comfort, and mercy that giveth us the final consummation and
   accomplishment of it at last. Our first entrance into the state of
   grace is always ascribed to mere mercy. Nothing moved the Lord to
   bestow life upon dead and graceless sinners but his mere pity and
   tender compassion: 1 Peter i. 3, Of his abundant mercy he hath begotten
   us to a lively hope:' Eph. ii. 4, God, who is rich in mercy, for his
   great love wherewith he hath loved us, while we were yet dead in
   trespasses and sins, yet quickened us:' Titus iii. 5, Of his mercy he
   hath saved us, by washing us in the laver of regeneration.' Mercy was,
   then, exercised not only without our desert, but against our desert:
   God was not moved to bestow his grace by any goodness which he did
   foresee or find in us, but merely by his own pity; misery offered the
   occasion, but mercy was the cause of all the good done unto us. After
   conversion, all our supports and supplies are given us of his tender
   mercy: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according to this rule, peace and
   mercy be upon them.' New creatures and the most accurate walkers are
   not so free from sin but they still stand in need of mercy. All their
   receipts come to them not in the way of merit, but undeserved mercy.
   Our peace and comfort, when we walk most according to rule, is the
   fruit of mercy. The elect are called Vessels of mercy,' Rom. ix. 23,
   because, from first to last, they are filled up with mercy, and
   supplied by the free favour and love of God in Jesus Christ. Our final
   consummation is from mercy: the same mercy that lays the first stone in
   this building doth also finish the work: Jude 21, Looking for the mercy
   of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.' We take glory out of the
   hands of mercy, and it is mercy that sets the crown upon our heads,
   after we have done and suffered the will of God here upon earth. We can
   merit no more after grace than before.

   [2.] The utility of it; this giveth boldness and more hopeful
   expectation; that will appear if we consider what mercy is. It is God's
   propension and inclination to do good to the sinful and miserable, so
   tar as his wisdom seeth convenient. As mercy is a perfection in the
   divine nature, so God is necessarily merciful as well as just; but the
   exercise of it is, I confess, free and arbitrary: it is not necessarily
   exercised but according to his will and good pleasure, to some more, to
   some less, as his wisdom thinketh fit. Yet this advantage we have by
   it, that mercy rather seeketh a fit occasion to discover itself than a
   well qualified object, as justice doth; for it doth not consider what
   is due or deserved, but what is needed. Therefore, first, the needy and
   miserable have some hope, for misery as misery is the object of mercy;
   and therefore when our afflictions are pressing and sore, our miseries
   and straits are some kind of argument which we may plead to God: Ps.
   lxxix. 8, Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us, for we are
   brought very low;' they plead their miserable condition. Mercy relents
   towards a sinful people when they are a wasted people: he heareth the
   moans of the beasts, and therefore certainly he will not shut up his
   bowels against the cries of his people; their very misery pleadeth for
   them. Secondly, the broken-hearted that have a sense of their misery
   have a greater advantage than others, and are more capable of God's
   mercy, because they are not only miserable, but miserable in their own
   feeling, especially if this feeling be deep and spiritual; they are
   sensible of the true misery, and they are more troubled about sin than
   temporal inconvenience: Mat. ix. 13, Go learn what that meaneth, I will
   have mercy and not sacrifice.'

   3. When we flee to his mercy, and seek it in the appointed way of
   repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ: the Lord
   will not utterly destroy a sinner fleeing to his mercy; he hath engaged
   his word and oath, Heb. vi. 18; and this comfort we may make use of
   partly when the sense of guilt sits heavy upon the soul; go humble
   yourselves before the merciful God, and sue out his favour and
   reconciliation with you, as David doth, Ps. li. 1, Have mercy upon me,
   according to thy loving-kindness; according to the multitude of thy
   tender mercies, blot out my transgressions:' you know not what a
   merciful God may do for his undeserving and ill-deserving people. And
   partly when God is upon his judicial process, and calleth a people to
   an account for their sins, he still retaineth his merciful nature: Hab.
   iii. 2, In the midst of wrath he remembereth mercy:' his wrath and
   indignation doth not so far transport him as that he should forget his
   merciful nature, and deal with his afflicted people without all
   moderation. When God is justly angry for sin it is a special time
   wherein to plead for mercy.

   Secondly, He beggeth that it may come to him. Let us see the meaning of
   the request, and then what may be observed upon it. Coming to him
   noteth a personal and effectual application.

   1. A personal application, as in the 41st verse of this psalm, Let thy
   mercies come to me also, even thy salvation, according to thy word.'
   David would not be forgotten, or left out or lost in the throng of
   mankind, when mercy was distributing the blessing to them.

   2. Effectual application, that noteth--(1.) The removing of obstacles
   and hindrances; (2.) The obtaining the fruits and effects of this
   mercy. First, The removing of obstacles. Till there be way made, the
   mercy of God cannot come at us, for the way is barricaded and shut up
   by our sins. As the Lord maketh a way for his anger, Ps. lxxviii. 50,
   by removing the hindrances, eating out the staff and the stay, taking
   away that which letteth, so the Lord maketh way for his mercy, or mercy
   maketh way for itself, when it removeth the obstruction; sin is the
   great hindrance of mercy. We ourselves raise the mists and the clouds
   which intercept the light of God's countenance; we build up the
   partition wall which separates between God and us, yet mercy finds the
   way. Secondly, The obtaining the fruits of mercy. The effects of God's
   tender mercies are common or saving. We read, Ps. cxlv. 9, The Lord is
   good to all, his tender mercies are over all his works;' not a creature
   which God hath made but the Lord pitieth it and supplieth its wants.
   But there are spiritual effects of the Lord's tender mercy, his
   pardoning our sins, restoring us to his grace and favour, and repairing
   his image in us: Eph. i. 3, Who hath blessed us with spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places in Christ;' such spiritual blessings as
   are a sure effect of God's favour, never given in anger. Riches may be
   given in anger, so may also temporal deliverance, but pardon of sin is
   never given in anger, nor the Spirit of the Lord Jesus to dwell in us.
   Of spiritual blessings, some are comfortable to us, others honourable
   to God; some fall in with our interest, others suit with God's end; as
   pardon is of the first sort, and the subjection of the creature to God
   of the latter. We are willing to be pardoned and freed from the curse
   of the law and the flames of hell, but to be renewed to the image of
   God and quickened to the life of grace, and put into a capacity to
   serve our Creator and Redeemer, that we are not so earnest for; and yet
   these are the undoubted pledges of the special mercy of God to us, and
   absolutely necessary to the enjoyment of other relative benefits. We
   must suppose David to intend both in his prayer, Let thy mercy come
   unto me.' Once more, these spiritual benefits may be considered as to
   the effects themselves, and the sense that we have of our enjoyment of
   them. Our safety dependeth upon the saving effects and fruits of God's
   special mercy, and our peace, joy, and comfort upon the sense of them.
   Both are comprised in that petition, Let thy tender mercies come unto
   me.' This being stated as the full meaning of the words, let us
   observe:--

   [1.] That it is not enough to hear of somewhat of God's saving mercies,
   but we should beg that it may come unto us, be effectually and sensibly
   communicated unto us, that we may have experience of them in our own
   souls; the hearsay will do us little good without experience; the
   hearsay is the first encouragement: We have heard the kings of Israel
   are merciful kings:' that moved them to make the address in a humble
   and submissive manner for their life and safety: 1 Kings xx. 31, Let
   us, I pray thee, put on sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our
   heads, and go to the king of Israel.' We may reason at a better rate
   concerning the God of Israel. We have heard that the God of Israel is a
   merciful God, that he delights in mercy; but then, Let us try what he
   will do for us. Upon the participation of the saving effects and
   benefits of his mercy, our comfort and interest beginneth. (1.) We
   shall never have such admiring thoughts of mercy as when we have felt
   it ourselves; then we know the grace of God in truth, Col. i. 6. A man
   that hath read of honey, or heard of honey, may know the sweetness of
   it by guess and imagination, but a man that hath tasted of honey
   knoweth the sweetness of it in truth; so by hearing or reading of the
   grace and mercy of God in Christ, we may guess that it is a sweet
   thing, but he that hath had an experimental proof of the sweet effects
   and fruit of it in his own heart, and all that is spoken of God's
   pardoning and comforting of sinners is verified in himself, this giveth
   him a more sensible demonstration of the worth and value of this
   privilege, then more admiring thoughts of mercy, when he can say, as
   Paul, 1 Tim. i. 13, elee'then, I was saved by mercy. (2.) We shall more
   love God: Phil. i. 9, I pray that your love may abound in all sense:'
   the spiritual gust maketh love abound. (3.) We cannot speak of it with
   that fulness, life, sense, and affection to others, nor so movingly
   invite others to share with us, as when the effects of his goodness are
   communicated to us: Ps. xxxiv. 8, Oh, taste and see that the Lord is
   good.' A report of a report is a dead cold thing, but a report from
   experience is lively and powerful. Well, then, let it come to me.

   [2.] The sense or participation of God's saving mercies is to believers
   the life of their lives, the heaven they have upon earth, the joy and
   comfort of their souls, and the want of this is a kind of death to
   them; for so David expresseth himself, Let thy tender mercies come unto
   me, that I may live.'

   The reasons are taken partly from the object, and partly from the
   subject--from the thing itself, and from the disposition of a renewed
   heart.

   1. From the thing itself, from the object; and there, first, the value
   of this privilege, compared with all that may be called life. Life is
   either natural, spiritual, or eternal.

   [1.] Compare it with life natural, and there the Psalmist will tell
   you: Ps. lxiii. 3, Thy loving-kindness is better than life:' life is
   not life without it; without the feeling of this love, or the hope of
   feeling it, it is little worth. To have the light of the sun, which is
   the comfort of the senses, without the light of God's countenance,
   which is the comfort of the soul, is a sad and dark estate, especially
   to the children of God, that know they are made for another world, and
   for this only in their passage thither. Natural life only giveth us a
   capacity to enjoy the comforts of sense, which are base, dreggy, and
   corruptive; but the special favour of God lets us into such
   consolations as perfect the soul, and affect it with a greater pleasure
   than our natural faculties are capable of. Life natural is a frail,
   brittle thing, but these saving effects of God's mercy lay a foundation
   of eternal happiness. Life natural may grow a burden, but the love of
   God is never burdensome; the days may come in which there is no
   pleasure, Eccles. xii. 1; Job xxxiii. 20, His life abhorreth bread, and
   his soul dainty food:' in sickness and age, in troubles of conscience.
   Men do pretty well with their worldly happiness till God rebuke man for
   sin; then all the glory, profit, and pleasure of the creature doth us
   no good: Ps. xxxix. 11, When thou with rebukes dost correct man for
   iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth.' Judas
   haltered himself when filled with the sense of God's wrath: Job chose
   strangling rather than life. At death, when all worldly things cease,
   and are of no more use to us, the sense of God's love will be of great
   use to us. All the world understand the worth and value of God's love
   when death cometh; then a child of God feeleth it. Oh, saith he, I
   would not for all the world but that I had made sure of the love of God
   before this hour! How terrible else would it have been to leave all and
   leap out into an unknown world! Jer. xvii. 9, The unjust man at his
   latter end shall be a fool:' and Job xxvii. 8, What is the hope of the
   hypocrite, if he hath gained, when God cometh to take away his soul?'

   [2.] Life spiritual: the soul hath no life but in communion with God,
   who is the fountain of this new life. Now the more sensible and close
   this is, the more they live; the vitality of this life lieth in the
   sensible participation of the effects of his special grace and mercy;
   then we have it more abundantly, John x. 10; not only living, but
   lively.

   [3.] For eternal life, a comfortable sense of God's mercy is the be
   ginning and pledge of the true and heavenly life, Rom. v. 4-6. The
   shedding abroad the love of God in the heart of a believer maketh this
   his hope sure and certain, he needeth not be ashamed, for he hath
   earnest beforehand.

   (1.) God's favour furnisheth us with a remedy against all evils and
   miseries; i.e., wants, troubles, sins. The want of other things may be
   supplied by the love of God, but the want of the love of God cannot be
   supplied with anything else; if poor in the world, yet we may be rich
   in faith, James ii. 5; if afflicted, destitute, yet this loss may be
   made up by the presence of God in the soul, 2 Cor. iv. 16. As our
   outward man decayeth, our inward man is renewed day by day. If they
   want the creature they have God; there is no want of a candle when they
   have the sun; if they want health, the soul may be in good plight, 3
   John 2, as Gaius had a healthy soul in a sickly body. If they want
   liberty, they lie open to the visits of his grace; the Spirit of God is
   no stranger to them, nor can his company and comforts be shut out.
   Tertullian telleth the martyrs, You went out of the prison when you
   went into it, and were but sequestered from the world, that you might
   converse with God: the greatest prisoners are those that are at large,
   darkened with ignorance, chained with lusts, committed not by the
   proconsul, but God. If they want the favour of men, they have the
   favour of God: God smileth when the world frowneth; they may be
   banished, but every place is alike near to God and heaven. Some
   climates are nearer and some further off from the sun, but all alike
   near to the sun of righteousness. Ubi pater ibi patria, that is our
   country where God is. We are harassed, beaten, afflicted in sundry
   manners, but the sting is gone; the rod that is dipped in guilt
   smarteth most, but a pardoned man may rejoice in tribulations, Rom. v.
   1, 2. But now, on the contrary, suppose a man high in honour, wallowing
   in wealth, spending his time and wealth in ease and pleasure, but after
   all this God will bring him to judgment. The world is his friend, but
   God is his enemy and he is all his lifetime subject to bondage, Heb.
   ii. 14; not always felt, but soon awakened; and during the time of his
   comfort and delight, he is dancing about the brink of hell, liable to
   an eternal curse; and there is but the slender thread of a frail life
   between him and execution, a few serious sober thoughts undo him.

   (2.) Sin; that is the great evil, both as to the guilt of it and the
   wages of it, the guilt and obliquity of it. No creature can provide a
   plaster for this sore; to get our consciences settled and our natures
   healed, this is the special fruit of God's mercy in Christ; his
   business is to save us from sin, Mat i. 21; Acts iii. 26, God having
   raised up his son Jesus, sent him to bless you in turning away every
   one of you from your iniquity:' Rom. xi. 26, There shall come out of
   Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:' have
   God's image repaired, and restored to his grace and favour. Those that
   have felt sin a burden, nothing will satisfy till the Lord looks
   graciously upon them.

   (3.) The favour of the Lord is the fountain of all blessings. Get an
   interest in his special mercy, and then all things are yours. You have
   God for your God, who commandeth all things: 1 Cor. iii. 22, Whether
   Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
   present, or things to come, all things are yours:' Mat. vi. 33, First
   seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
   shall be added to you:' Prov. x. 22, The blessing of the Lord maketh
   rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.'

   (4.) It sweetens every comfort; a piece of bread with the love of God
   is a plentiful feast. A little that a righteous man hath is better than
   the revenue of many wicked.' Quid prodest regium alimentum si ad
   Gehennam pascal?--what profiteth it to be fatted for slaughter?

   2. Reasons from the subject, or disposition of the renewed heart.

   [1.] They have once had an apprehension of their true misery by reason
   of sin and the curse. None prize the favour of God, but they have been
   burdened with the sense of sin and misery. We speak in vain to most
   men; it is only the sick will prize the physician, the condemned be
   earnest for a pardon.

   [2.] They are renewed. Till a man be holy he cannot rejoice in
   spiritual things; the fool's heart is always in the house of mirth,
   Eccles. vii. 4. For masks, and plays, and merry meetings, feasts and
   banquets, and vain company, and idle games and pastimes, these are the
   life and joy of their souls. A fool will make a foolish choice, as
   children prefer their rattles and toys before a solid benefit: Rom.
   viii. 5, For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
   flesh, and they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit:'
   the desire showeth what is delightful and comfortable, but now the
   renewed heart, it is their all to be in favour with God. They have not
   the spirit of the world, 1 Cor. ii. 3; many have affections for
   anything but God.

   Use 1. The use is--(1.) Reproof to those that care not for this sense
   of God's mercy. David could not think himself alive till he was
   reconciled to God. Profane men are not much troubled with this care;
   though God be angry they can seek their delight elsewhere; they can
   rejoice in the creature apart from God; so they may have outward things
   they are at ease, and can sing lullabies to their souls, as that wretch
   in the parable, Luke xii. 19, Eat, drink, and be merry.' If they be in
   trouble, they seek to put away their troubles by carnal means. Let
   these consider, first, God can make the stoutest-hearted sinner who
   standeth aloof from him to see he is undone without him. It is no hard
   thing to put a sinner in the stocks of conscience, so that one
   favourable look would be valued more than all the world. Secondly, It
   may be, when punishment hath opened their eyes, God may hide his face
   and withhold the blessing from them when they seek it with bitter
   tears: Prov. i, 28, They shall call upon me, but I will not answer;
   they shall seek me early, but shall not find me.' (2.) To shame the
   people of God that have such cold and careless thoughts about that
   which true believers count as dear as their lives.

   1. This slightness cometh from carnal complacency, or inordinate
   delight in the creature, or letting out ourselves to worldly delights.
   Now this is vile ingratitude, when God's gifts, and those of the worser
   sort, draw us from himself. Will you be of a Gadarene spirit, or as one
   of the vain fellows, as Michal told David scoffingly?

   2. Consider how dangerous this is to our temporal and eternal felicity.
   Temporal felicity: The creature is blasted when our life is bound up
   with it; the world is eclipsed that the favour of God may be more
   prized, and the loss of the creature should more awaken us to seek
   after God. We most prize the evidences of God's favour and
   reconciliation with him when we are in trouble, and God taketh away our
   worldly comforts, that the consolations of his Spirit may not seem as
   small things. Many have smarted for carnal complacency. Eternal
   felicity: When any carnal thing is valued more than God, it puts our
   eternal comforts upon a hazard; it is a selling the birthright for a
   mess of pottage, Heb. xii. 15. Well, then, let us be weaned from the
   world, for while we take too much delight in the creature God is the
   less esteemed.

   Use 2. Instruction, to teach us how to carry ourselves with respect to
   this privilege, a sense of the love of God shed abroad in our hearts in
   the fruits and effects thereof.

   1. Let us make it our chiefest care to get and preserve the fresh sense
   of God's love upon our hearts, grudging at no labour: 2 Peter i. 10,
   Give diligence to make your calling and election sure,' &c. No cost:
   Mat. xiii. 46, When he had found one pearl of great price, he went and
   sold all that he had, and bought it;' Phil. iii. 8, 9, denying lusts
   and interests.

   2. Not to hazard it on cheap terms. God forbid that I should sell my
   inheritance! Will you sell away Christ and heaven for such cheap rates,
   hazard your souls for carnal satisfaction?

   3. Let us be sensible of the want of it as the greatest misery, Mat.
   ix. 15.

   4. Rejoice in it above all things, Ps. iv. 6, 7. Be glad if this be
   promoted, though by sharp afflictions.

   Doct. 2. All such as would have the comfortable effects and sense of
   God's mercy must delight in his law.

   1. Delight in the law implieth obedience, for it is not a delight that
   ariseth from speculation, or the contemplation of the truth revealed
   therein. I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my
   heart,' Ps. xl. 8; and Ps. cxii. 1, Blessed is the man that feareth the
   Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments;' not in the
   knowledge of their duty, but in the practice of it. It is in the law as
   the rule of duty, and all tendeth to practice. They that delight in the
   speculation grudge at the practice. One that is observant of God's will
   delighteth to believe and obey, as well as to know God's word.

   2. A ready and cheerful obedience must be willingly and heartily
   undertaken; love to the work for the work's sake. A man is never truly
   converted to God till God hath his love, and his law hath his love; for
   the constitution of the heart is not seen in our opinions so much as in
   our affections, love, desire, and delight. Many men's judgment is for
   God; that is, conscience is for God, but their hearts are for other
   things; when obedience is practically and cheerfully undertaken, and
   the delight of our souls in them. Men have a little compulsory
   religiousness; it is most when frightened into it. Men do something,
   but had rather leave it undone, and do not choose rather to walk holily
   if they had their own choice. A man is slavish when fear of being
   damned doth only sway him; the godly love holiness as holiness, they
   are constant with God.

   But why do they that have a comfortable sense of his mercy delight in
   his law?

   1. These are only fit to ask mercy.

   2. These are qualified to receive mercy.

   1. These are only fit to ask mercy.

   [1.] Because they are likely to ask it most feelingly. None prize the
   mercy of God, nor will ask it in such an earnest and broken hearted
   manner, as those that delight in his law. These see their want of it,
   they are sensible of more defects than others are: Rom. vii. 24, O
   wretched man that I am!' They mind their work, which others, that
   exercise themselves not unto godliness, mind not; they have greater
   light and greater discoveries, more love; much work driveth them
   oftener to the throne of grace. None rest in duties so much as they
   that have least cause: Mal. i. 13, What a weariness is it!'

   [2.] These ask more regularly; therefore it is said, Ps. xxxvii. 4,
   Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desire of thy
   heart.' Why so unlimitedly? Because delight in the Lord retrencheth
   carnal desires and moderateth earthly desire; their hearts are not so
   set upon outward things as the hearts of other men are: John xv. 7, If
   ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,
   and it shall be done unto you.' Why doth God make so large an offer? He
   trusteth such as keep communion with Christ. There is a conformity
   between their wills and God's in the matter of their desire so far as
   we are renewed and hold communion with him; their unruly lusts will be
   subdued, and their unlawful desires for matter, manner, and end be laid
   aside, and they will acquiesce in the good pleasure of God, and the
   most excellent things. Therefore God maketh them this offer, Ask what
   ye will. Not that men are warranted to pray for what they will, or to
   expect an answer in whatsoever they desire, but as their delight in his
   law is prevalent, their wills are limited by his word and will, and the
   Spirit in them maketh intercession according to the will of God,' Rom.
   viii. 26, 27.

   [3.] These may with most confidence ask mercy; others are excluded:
   Prov. xxviii. 9, He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, his
   prayer is an abomination to the Lord.' These are included: 1 John iii.
   22, And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his
   commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.' If
   we refuse God speaking to us in infinite wisdom, as he does in the
   word, no wonder if God refuse us stammering foolishly in prayer, Jer.
   ix. 21. Men that purpose to continue in their sins shall not be heard
   in other things, otherwise the grossest sinners may come to God to have
   their sins pardoned and removed, and expect to be accepted and heard
   through Christ; but the perpetual assistance and favour of God is not
   given to them. Such as would be heard and accepted, and come with
   assurance of welcome and audience, ought to be devoted to him, to
   worship him, to call on him.

   2. These are qualified to receive mercy, according to the tenor of that
   covenant in which mercy is dispensed and magnified in the covenant of
   grace or the covenant of God's mercy in Christ, Heb. v. 9, and x. 14.
   This being apt to be abused, let us explain, how obedience is a
   condition of the covenant A condition meriting and purchasing the
   blessings of the covenant it cannot be; for God giveth the ability to
   obey wholly and solely of his own grace: it is short of the rule, and
   infinitely inferior to the reward. A condition applicatory, whereby we
   apply ourselves to the covenant on our part, it is, and therefore
   necessary. It is a secondary condition, disposing us to communion, with
   God in and by the covenant. At first we must be turned by repentance
   towards God, through faith in the Redeemer, before we receive remission
   of sins, Acts xx. 18. Faith and repentance are conditions of pardon,
   and sincere obedience a condition of salvation. The first condition
   containeth a resolution of obedience for the future, though we have not
   actually so obeyed. The secondary condition, that we should make good
   our resolution. We must keep covenant as well as make covenant. Faith
   is an entering into covenant, for it is a consent to take Christ as
   lord and saviour; and constant and delightful obedience is a constant
   keeping covenant, Ps. xxv. 10, and ciii. 17, 18. The making covenant
   was necessary for our entrance, the keeping covenant for our
   continuance. Consent to take any for king, husband, master, draweth
   another condition after it, that we carry ourselves in these relations
   dutifully: besides promising there must be performing; he that is my
   sovereign must be obeyed. There must be conjugal fidelity to the
   husband, and faithful service to the chosen master; so in the covenant
   between us and God, us and Christ.

   Object. But you will say. How, then, shall we take comfort in the new
   covenant, who are so many ways faulty?

   Ans. We must consider--(1.) What it exacts; (2.) What it accepteth.

   1. What it exacts. To quicken us to more earnest endeavours and humble
   confession of failings, it exacteth perfect obedience, admits of no
   imperfection either of parts or degrees.

   2. It accepteth a perfection of parts, there being truth of godliness,
   and a single-hearted inclination to observe the whole will of God; then
   our defects and weaknesses are covered by Christ's perfect
   righteousness. The unregenerate lie under the rule of exaction, but
   being out of Christ, are denied the benefit of acceptation.

   Use 1. To inform us that petitions of mercy and the plea for new
   obedience are very consistent: Let thy tender mercies come unto me;'
   and his argument is, For I delight in thy word.' Mercy is nevertheless
   free, though the creature mind his duty; for when we have done all we
   are but unprofitable servants, Luke xvii. 10; and grace helpeth us to
   do what we do: Luke xix. 18, Thy pound,' not my industry; and 1 Cor.
   xv. 10, By the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace, which was
   bestowed upon me, was not in vain: but I laboured more abundantly than
   they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." It was
   grace to appoint such reasonable terms, to accept of them, though done
   in that sorry fashion which our frailty permitteth us to tender to God.

   Use 2. To quicken us to a delightful course of obedience, if we would
   have the sense of mercy. The same spirit that urgeth us to obey, a
   sense of God's love, urgeth us also to delight in his law. The same
   spirit that urgeth us to sue out the promise urgeth also to obey the
   precept

   1. Consider how God hath twisted his honour with our interest, and
   ordered both for his own glory. God's interest and honour is to be
   considered as well as our salvation. We must never look for such mercy
   and grace from God as shall discharge us from our duty and subjection
   to God, or give you liberty to dishonour and disobey him. No; Christ
   redeemed us to God,' Rev. v., and Luke i. 74, 75. Salvation is our
   benefit, obedience is God's right and interest. Happiness man is not
   averse from, but he sticketh at the terms. Some part of this happiness
   suiteth well enough with our natural desires, as pardon and life; but
   we care not for his law and the obedience we owe by virtue of it. We
   are naturally more willing of what maketh for ourselves, for our
   comfort, than what maketh for the honour of God.

   2. Consider, a great part of God's first mercy is expressed in healing
   our natures and preparing us for this delightful course of holiness,
   Heb. x. 16, 17; 1 Cor. i. 30; Titus iii. 4, 5.

   3. Consider, this comfortable sense of God's mercy should induce us to
   this by way of argument: 1 John iv. 19, We love him because he first
   loved us;' 2 Cor. v. 14, 15, For the love of Christ constraineth us;
   because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead;
   and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth
   live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose
   again;' and Gal. v. 6, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth
   anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith, which worketh by love.' And
   then, by way of gratitude, we ought to bend all the powers of our souls
   to holiness and obedience, and lay out our care and labour upon it.

   4. Consider, the more holiness and obedience any one hath, the more
   acceptable to God. A holy soul is an object capable of God's love; the
   holy God delighteth in holiness, as well as the merciful God pitieth
   misery. The more holy we are, the more God loves us. Let us not make
   wounds for God to cure. As we increase in holiness we increase in
   favour with God. This is true of Christ, who never had any defect of
   holiness, but only was to increase in the exercise of it.

   5. Consider how just it is with God to refuse our cries for mercy when
   we despised his precepts for duty. Besiege your hearts with these
   considerations, and press them daily upon you. We are marvellous apt to
   please ourselves with some loose apprehensions of mercy, without
   bending ourselves to our duty.

   6. Consider how reasonable it is that, when mercy hath taken us, with
   all our faults, at our first entrance into covenant with God, we should
   afterwards study to please and make it our delight so to do.

   7. Consider how impossible it is to cherish a sense of his mercy and
   love to us while we neglect duty. The soul hath two sentiments of
   religion which can never be defaced--a desire of happiness, and
   subjection to God--ut anima sit subjecta Deo et pacata in se. As we
   love our own comfort, so we will be troubled about our duty; the soul
   will not sit easy. Comfort follows holiness as light doth fire, and sin
   will cause trouble as the prick of a needle doth pain. The soul cannot
   be serious and mind things but it will be so. Indeed, at some times, by
   carelessness, our sense of the necessity of obedience is extinguished,
   and then a little serveth turn to keep the conscience quiet or stupid;
   but it will return again. Never leave till holiness and obedience be
   your delight as well as your care.

   Use 3. To press us to be earnestly dealing with this merciful God for
   comfort. We need it now in a time of judgment, when delivered over to
   judgments, Hosea xi. 8, as sometimes to sin, so to plagues; when God
   opens the floodgates, lets out judgments upon a people without
   restraint: I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end
   shall be,' Deut. xxxii. 20. So also the 30th verse, Their rock sold
   them, and the Lord hath shut them up.' Mercy can put a stop, but that
   will interpose no more. Again, when the people of God are much hated
   and maligned; now, We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
   perplexed, but not in despair,' 2 Cor. iv. 8.

   1. If it be God's nature to be merciful and kind, why should we be
   discouraged? Mercy is free, favour is shown to a miserable person.
   Mercy can recall the punishments due to us, and mitigate corrections,
   and sweeten our comforts.

   2. But, then, you must be content that mercy should issue out in its
   own way and order; first giving us principal mercies, then necessary;
   first sanctifying, and then comforting: Saving us by washing us in the
   laver of regeneration.'

   3. Reckon your comfort more by a sense of God's care than by removing
   temporal trouble. Spiritual comfort is more excellent than bodily.

   4. You must sue it out by prayer, wherein, first, it must be with
   brokenness of heart. Let true spiritual misery be discerned and
   complained of. Let us lay our sins and sores before his pity. Secondly,
   with faith, for here is the word mentioned. Why are we so disconsolate?
   is there no balm in Gilead? It is our usual fault, we pore too much
   upon our troubles. There is a God of comfort, who answereth his name
   every way, and will keep his word with his people. Let us come to him
   in all our wants. Thirdly, with resolution of more faithful obedience,
   for God's servants are only capable; renew your covenant of serving
   God.

   5. The godly have common comforts. What will serve one's turn will
   serve another's also. They have all the same fundamental work of grace
   in their hearts; they are all born of God, have his image stamped on
   them, have the same Redeemer; the same Spirit worketh in all, and the
   promises are made alike unto all, not upon personal considerations.

SERMON LXXXVI.

   Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a
   cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.--Ver. 78.

   IN these words you have--(1.) David's prayer; (2.) David's resolution.

   First, David's prayer; and there take notice of--

   1. The petition itself, let the proud be ashamed.

   2. The reason, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause.

   In the prayer he beggeth the repression of his enemies. There take
   notice of--

   [1.] The notion by which they are described, the proud.

   [2.] The event or effect of God's providence desired concerning them,
   let them be ashamed.

   The notion is considerable. The wicked, especially the persecutors of
   God's people, are usually characterised by this term in this Psalm, the
   proud,' ver. 51, 69, 122; and will give us this note:--

   Doct. That pride puts wicked men upon being troublesome and injurious
   to the people of God.

   But why are the persecutors and the injurious called the proud?

   Ans. 1. Because wicked men shake off the yoke of God, and will not be
   subject to their Maker, and therefore desist not from troubling his
   people: Exod. v. 2, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice, and
   let Israel go?' What was in his tongue is in all men's hearts; they
   contemn God and his laws. Every sin hath a degree of pride and
   depreciation of God included in it: 2 Sam. xii. 9, Wherefore hast thou
   despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight?' There
   is a slighting of God's authority, and a lifting up our will against
   the will of God.

   Ans. 2. Because they are drunk with worldly felicity, and never think
   of changes: Ps. cxxiii. 4, Our soul is exceedingly filled with the
   scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the
   proud.' When men go on prosperously, they are apt wrongfully to trouble
   others, and then to shout at them in their misery, and to despise the
   person and cause of God's people, which is a sure effect of great
   arrogancy and pride. They think they may do what they please; they have
   no changes; therefore they fear not God, and put forth their hands
   against such as be at peace with them, Ps. lv. 19, 20; whilst they go
   on prosperously and undisturbedly, they cannot abstain from violence
   and oppression. This is certainly pride, for it is a lifting up the
   heart above God and against God, and without God. And they do not
   consider his providence, who alternately lifts up and casts down, that
   adversity may not be without a cordial, nor prosperity without a curb
   and bridle. But when men sit fast, and are well at ease, they are apt
   to be insolent and scornful. Riches and worldly greatness make men
   insolent and despisers of others, and care not what burdens they impose
   upon them; they are intrenched within a mass of wealth and power and
   greatness, and so think none can call them to an account. Solomon
   speaketh of two sorts of people: Prov. xviii. 10, 11, The name of the
   Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. The
   rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own
   conceit.' Every man is as his trust is; for, as the Psalmist speaketh
   of idols in general, They that trust in idols are like unto them,' so
   it is true of spiritual idols. If a man trust in vain things, his heart
   groweth vain, proud, and insolent; promiseth him an uninterrupted
   course of felicity, from poor, perishing things, that come and go at
   God's pleasure. If a man trust in God, then he is kept holy, humble,
   carried on with a noble and divine spirit, and findeth more safety than
   another that hath all the strength and power of the world to support
   and back him. The name of the Lord is a real refuge, but wealth and
   honour and worldly greatness is but an imaginary refuge. He that hath
   nothing but the name of the Lord to trust in, worldlings think he
   buildeth castles in the air; but the godly knoweth that worldlings
   indeed build castles in the air, while they look big, and think their
   greatness shall bear them out. Alas! wealth is but a wall and a strong
   tower in their own conceit; not really so; but this puffeth them up,
   and they are quite other men when they are at top than what they were
   when they were under.

   Ans. 3. Because they affect a life of pomp and ease and carnal
   greatness, and so despise the affliction and meanness and simplicity of
   the people of God. The false church hath usually the advantage of
   worldly power and external glory, and the true church is known by the
   divine power, gifts, and graces, and the lustre of holiness: Ps. xlv.
   13, The king's daughter is glorious within;' is found out by faith,
   love, patience, sobriety, heavenly-mindedness, humility, purity, and
   the like, rather than by a splendid appearance; and holiness becomes
   God's house, Ps. xciii. 5, rather than gold and silver and costly
   furniture. The false church vaunts itself in costly temples, officers
   richly endowed with temporal revenues, and a pompous attendance; and so
   the simplicity of the gospel is corrupted and turned into a worldly
   domination. As, for instance, the church of Rome boasts of her grandeur
   and magnificence, and upbraids the Reformed with their abject
   condition. Ministris eorum nihil vilius, saith Campian. They can tell
   of the pompous inauguration of their popes, their stately train of
   cardinals, lordly prelates; whereas the poor ministers of the gospel
   live hardly and precariously. Whereas, indeed, the glory of the true
   church doth not make a fair show in the flesh, is not external,
   corporeal, and visible, but internal, incorporeal, and invisible, Cant.
   i. 5; and like its head, Jesus Christ, who, to appearance, was humble,
   poor, and afflicted; but in him were hidden all the treasures of wisdom
   and knowledge; yea, the fulness of the godhead dwelt bodily. External
   splendour pleaseth the flesh, and is not a sign of virtue so much as
   pride, Luke xvi. 19. What shall become of the primitive church for the
   first three hundred years, if outward greatness be a mark of it? The
   world is with them, but the faith with us; they have pure gold, but we
   pure doctrine (Naz. Orat. Con. Aroc.) So Hilary against Auxentius, Unum
   moneo, cavete antichristum, male enim vos parietum amor cepit, male
   ecclesiam Dei in tectis artificiisque veneramini, male sub iis pacis
   nomen ingeritis: anne ambiguum est in iis antichristum cessurum? Monies
   mihi et sylvae et lacus et carceres, et voragines sunt tutiores; in its
   enim prophetae aut manentes, aut demersi, Dei Spiritu prophetabant.
   Well, because of their affectation of worldly greatness, they are
   called proud; and so it is taken, Mal. iii. 15, Ye call the proud
   happy.' And because of this they hate and molest the people of God,
   because theirs is a contrary spirit. They hear Christ's voice: Mat. xi.
   29, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.' They hate them because they
   contemn that felicity which they affect, and so put a scorn on their
   way: 1 Peter iv. 4, Think it strange that you run not with them into
   the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.'

   Ans. 4. They are called proud because of their insolent carriage
   towards the Lord's people, partly in their laws and injunctions,
   requiring to give them more honour, respect, and obedience than in
   conscience can be afforded them; as Haman would have Mordecai to devote
   himself to him after the manner of the Persians, Esther iii. 5. The
   man, though a favourite, was an Amalekite, one that came of that stock
   whose remembrance God would have to be blotted out, Exod. xvii. 14; and
   possibly more worship and honour was required than was due to a man.
   God had forbidden to give divine honour to any but himself. Now,
   according to the custom of Persia, these honours did somewhat savour of
   divine worship--Vide Brisson, pp. 10-14, with the 18th. So Jeroboam
   would have his calves worshipped, 1 Kings xii. 32; and yet all that
   complied with him therein are charged for walking so willingly after
   the commandment, Hosea v. 11. We dare not offend God to please men; the
   good Levites are commended, 2 Chron. xi. 14. So it was pride in
   Nebuchadnezzar to command all men to bow before his image, Dan. iii.
   15, 16. God's prerogative must not be incroached upon; there is a
   superior sovereign. Partly in vexing, molesting, and oppressing them at
   their pleasure; the formal Christian hateth the spiritual, Gal. iv. 29.
   Now this cometh from their pride: Ps. x. 2, The wicked in his pride
   doth persecute the poor;' would not have their lazy course upbraided
   and disgraced by the seriousness and strictness of others: they malign
   what they cannot imitate. And it is carried on by their pride or abuse
   of power. God counteth it pride: Ps. xii. 5, For the oppression of the
   poor, for the sighing of the needy; the Lord will arise to deliver him;
   and set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.' It is the pride of
   the oppressor which God taketh notice of, his puffing, scoffing, and
   mocking at the hopes of God's despised ones; he never dreameth of any
   checks from any, but despiseth and contemneth all. And partly because
   of the insulting over their misery and low estate: Zeph. ii. 10, This
   shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and
   magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts.' But God
   taketh notice of it, and will call them to an account in due time:
   Prov. iii. 34, He scorneth the scorners, but giveth grace unto the
   lowly;' Ps. xiv. 6, You have shamed the counsel of the poor, because
   the Lord is his refuge:' i.e., mocked at a man because he is resolved
   to trust in the Lord, laughed at those that made conscience of their
   duty, that consulted whether lawful or unlawful, not whether danger and
   profit, not whether safe or unsafe, but whether pleasing to God or not.
   They trust in the Lord that, in conscience of their duty, venture upon
   hazards, expecting their security from heaven; these thoughts seemed
   foolish to worldly wisdom; you shamed his counsel, scoff at it: Isa.
   li. 7, 8, Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor their revilings: for the
   moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like
   wool.' Those that make reckoning of the ways of God need not be
   discouraged with their spiteful vaunts.

   Use. Let us take heed of pride. The Lord, that hated the pride of Moab,
   doth also hate the pride of Jacob, Amos vi. 8.

   1. Take heed of wittingly and willingly opposing any command of God:
   Ps. cxix. 21, Thou hast rebuked the proud, that are cursed, which do
   err from thy commandments:' Neh. ix. 16, But our fathers dealt proudly,
   and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to his commandments;' so
   ver. 29. These proclaim a war with the Lord of hosts, especially when
   not reclaimed by grievous judgments: Isa. xxvi. 19, I will break the
   pride of your power.' And this is that we should lay to heart at this
   day: Jer. xiii. 17, But if ye will not hear, my soul shall weep in
   secret places for your pride.' When a people will not be brought to any
   serious consideration of God's judgments, nor abate their haughty
   minds, he would bewail their foolish arrogancy, and the miseries
   ensuing thereupon. This standing out against God is the greatest pride.

   2. Take heed of murmuring against his providence. Entertaining crosses
   with anger and blessings with disdain are sure notes of unmortified
   pride; when God's dispensations still displease, and the heart swelleth
   against his sovereignty.

   [1.] To entertain crosses with anger: 2 Kings vi. 33, This evil is from
   the Lord: why should I wait any longer upon the Lord?' Words of
   desperate distrust and murmuring.

   [2.] Blessings with disdain: Mal. i. 2, I hath loved you, saith the
   Lord; and they said, Wherein hast thou loved us?' as if God owed them
   more than others, and were a kind of debtor to them: Hab. ii. 4,
   Behold, his soul, which is lifted up, is not upright in him; but the
   just shall live by his faith.' The lofty and unsound are distinguished
   from the just, who can tarry God's leisure; those men's souls are
   lifted up who cannot acquiesce in their lot and portion assigned by
   God, but censure his way of proceeding, and are loath he should have
   the disposing of them at his pleasure.

   3. Take heed of despising any of Christ's little ones, and scorning and
   mocking at those that fear the Lord: Ps. cxix. 51, The proud have had
   me greatly in derision.' To make a mock of others upon any account is a
   sign of pride, though they be meaner in gifts, though differing in
   judgment, though walking in a lower dispensation; but especially to
   scorn at them because more godly: 2 Tim. iii. 3, aphila'gathoi,
   Despisers of those that are good.' This is to reflect upon God himself,
   whose image in his saints is made a byword, and a strict obedience to
   his will matter of scorn and derision. If a slave should mock a child
   because he is like his father, would this be well taken? So the jealous
   God will not long endure this horrible indignity, that his image should
   be scorned in his children: Isa. lxiii. 9, In all reproaches he is
   reproached.' But they will say, It is not their holiness, but their
   demure hypocrisy and affected preciseness, which they reproach and
   scorn. But God seeth the heart: it is as if a leper did upbraid others
   with pimples. The infirmities of the godly do not justify your contempt
   of godliness; and because of their faults, you must not scorn at their
   holiness and expect indemnity.

   4. Take heed of moral pride, which consists in a lofty conceit of our
   selves, joined with a contempt of others. This was the Pharisees' sin:
   Luke xviii. 9, He spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
   themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.' And it is
   notably personated in the Pharisee and publican who went up to pray,
   and is daily seen in them who are speaking of their own things,
   boasting of their own excellences, elevating their own, but extenuating
   the gifts of others. Most men are too great and too good in their own
   esteem. Self-love representeth ourselves to ourselves in a feigned
   shape and likeness, much more wise, and holy, and just, than we are; it
   maketh us loathe other men's sins rather than our own, to extenuate
   other men's gifts and graces and cry up our own; but this should not
   be: Phil. ii. 3 Let each esteem another better than themselves.'
   Humility is content to sit in the meanest place: Eph. iii. 8, Who am
   the least of all the saints:' 1 Tim. i. 15, Christ came to save
   sinners, of whom I am chief.' We know our own weakness better than
   others, and they may have secret excellences which we see not. This
   moral pride discovereth itself in three things:--

   [1.] In disdain of inferiors, or contempt of those who are of meaner
   gifts or rank and place in the world. Every member hath its use in the
   body, the toe as well as the head, neither can one say to another, I
   have no need of thee,' 1 Cor. xii. 21. All Christians have their
   peculiar gifts, by which they are rendered acceptable and useful to the
   body, as every country hath its proper commodities for the maintaining
   of trade and commerce between all parts of the world; or as to the
   beauty and use of the universe, there is need of hills and valleys; so
   all ranks of men contribute to the beauty, use, and service of the
   whole. The strong should not despise the weak, nor the weak prescribe
   to the strong. Now, it is impossible to keep all in their due order and
   proportion unless every one consider their own weakness and want, and
   the usefulness of others; as, among Christians, some are useful to
   preserve order, others to keep afoot the life and power of godliness,
   some to revive the pristine purity, others the old peaceable spirit.
   God hath so counterbalanced all parties that they may be mutually
   helpful, but not that we despise and contemn any other, and seek to
   destroy and subvert another, and so make way for great mischiefs. Every
   one hath enough to humble him, and enough to render him useful to human
   society. Therefore we must not set at nought our brother, Rom. xiv. 10.
   God hath made him something which thou art not, and given him an
   ability to do something thou canst not do, or wouldst not submit unto.
   Contempt is the fruit of pride; there are none but deserve some
   respect: scorn is the bane of human society.

   [2.] It betrayeth itself in contention with equals: Wrath and
   contention cometh by pride,' Prov. xiii. 10. Every one seeks to be
   eminent, and would excel, not in graces and gifts--that is agathe'ris,
   a holy emulation--but in rank and place. We set too high a price upon
   our selves, and when others will not come up to our price we are
   troubled. We ascribe too much to ourselves; and when we meet not with
   that respect and honour which we affect, we fall into contention, and
   break out into strifes, supposing ourselves neglected. We see often
   what a makebait this is in the world, if others do not accommodate
   themselves to our sense, if they approve not all things we say, if
   their opinion differeth a little, or, it may be, nothing from ours. Men
   pertinaciously obstinate in their preconceptions will not change
   opinion upon apparent evidence; but humble men are always peaceable,
   they can better give and take those respects which are done to one
   another than others can. The apostle saith, Eph. v. 21, Submit
   yourselves to one another in the fear of God.' There is a service of
   love which every one oweth to another for their mutual good and
   advantage, and is called submission, though it be to equals, because
   our proud and lofty spirits look upon it as below us. There are none
   living whom God alloweth to live only to themselves. Now, that there
   may be an equality, we are to stoop and condescend to one another;
   others are to live to us, and we to them: 1 Peter v. 5, Be subject one
   to another, and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud,
   and giveth grace to the humble." This mutual subjection to another in
   the duties of love can never be obtained till we learn to moderate our
   esteem of ourselves, and heighten our esteem of others; we can neither
   advise nor instruct, nor esteem one another, nor maintain peace in our
   relations, and perform all Christian offices to each other, till this
   spirit prevail with us.

   [3.] By undutifulness to superiors, or those that are preferred in
   honour before ourselves. Proud men would be admired of all, well
   thought of and spoken of by all, and preferred above all; and if it be
   not so, they are discontented, and a secret enmity and malignity
   invadeth their spirits and settleth itself there; it is an apparent
   fruit of natural corruption: James iv. 5, The spirit that dwelleth in
   us lusteth to envy.' Men cannot endure either the real or reputed
   excellency of others; the proud creature would shine alone. Therefore
   we are secretly nibbling at the credit of others, blasting their
   reputation, and desire by all means to lessen them, or that they should
   be lessened; and where this disposition prevaileth into any degree of
   strength and tyranny, it groweth outrageous: Prov. xxvii. 4, Wrath is
   cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?'
   For when we are grieved at the prosperity and excellency of others, we
   seek to undermine them by all the means we can devise; as when the
   brothers of Joseph sought to put him out of the way; and when Saul
   envied David, he was still plotting his destruction. So when the
   Pharisees envied Christ, If we let him alone, all men will run after
   him.' This brought them to crucify the Lord of glory. Anger venteth
   itself in sudden flashes, and wrath in some present act of violence,
   but envy is injurious and treacherous. Anger and wrath suppose some
   offence, but envy is troubled at the goodness and excellency of others.
   Anger and wrath are assuaged by degrees, and when the raging billows
   and tempest ceaseth, there is a calm; but this groweth by time, and is
   exasperated more and more the longer those whom we envy are in good
   condition. Now this affection reigned in us in our natural estate,
   Titus iii. 3, and remaineth in some degree in the best.

   5. Another expression of pride is impatience of admonitions and
   reproofs; that is the cause of the wicked's hatred of the godly,
   because their lives are a real reproof: John vi. 7, The world hateth
   me, because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil;' Heb. xi.
   7. But surely it argueth a proud spirit when men cannot endure friendly
   counsel, and will not have their privy sores touched, but they grow
   fierce and outrageous, especially when they excel others in rank and
   power: as when the prophet reproved Amaziah, 2 Chron. xxv. 16, Art thou
   made of the king's counsel? forbear, why shouldest thou be smitten?' so
   2 Chron. xviii. 23, He smote him on the cheek, and said, When went the
   Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?' So the Pharisees hated
   Christ because of his free reproofs: John ix. 40, Are we blind also?'
   They cannot endure to hear of their faults, especially from one in an
   inferior condition, and think every reproof to be a reproach, though
   never so wisely and compassionately managed, and that it is beneath
   their rank to stoop to it; though Job despised not the cause of his
   maid-servants, Job xxxi. 13, if they had anything to say against him;
   and David stopped upon Abigail's motion, 1 Sam. xxv. 26.

   6. Take heed of building too securely upon earthly enjoyments, as if
   your estate were so firm and secure that it could not be altered,
   because you are high and great in wealth, power, honour, and esteem.
   Confidence in our outward estate is a sure note of pride: Ps. x. 4-6,
   The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after
   God: God is not in all his thoughts. His ways are always grievous; thy
   judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he
   puffeth at them. He hath said in heart, I shall not be moved; I shall
   not be in adversity.' There the Psalmist chargeth pride on the wicked,
   and such a pride as ariseth from confidence in outward prosperity; and
   mentioneth a double effect, not only slighting their adversaries, but
   God himself. It is no matter for any terms of peace or moderation
   towards their adversaries, his ways are always grievous; therefore are
   they violent, fierce and high, and severe towards them. Do not need the
   protection of God; therefore cold, flat, negligent in prayer; yea,
   scorn to implore God by prayer for any blessing. They are so high in
   place and power, that they are able to oppress their underlings, and so
   think they can bring to pass what they would have to be done in despite
   of God. Now somewhat of this may be found in the people of God: Ps.
   xxx. 6, In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.' They drink in
   some of this poison, are apt to rest and sleep on a carnal pillow. By
   this you may see that none of us have perfectly put off this sin. Plato
   saith a man doth put it off, as teleutaion chitona, it groweth out of
   the conquest of other sins. But if we would not be proud--

   [1.] Let us pray often, for in prayer we profess our subjection and
   dependence. Where prayers are fervent, earnest, frequent, it argueth
   great humility; where rare, cold, unfrequent, little humility; where
   none, no humility. Seeking to God, who is so excellent, mindeth us of
   our own baseness; seeking his daily relief and succour mindeth us of
   the changeableness of all worldly things, and the several vicissitudes
   of this life, Ps. x. 4. A man serious in prayer, living in a constant
   dependence upon God, must needs be a humble man.

   [2.] Let us be contented with a little, and not seek great things for
   ourselves; for interest is the great makebait. I am sure a worldly
   portion is the usual fuel of pride. A worm may grow in manna, but
   usually it is some worldly excellency which giveth us such great
   advantages here below which puffeth us up. If riches increase by the
   fair allowance of God's providence, we are not to grow proud of them: 1
   Tim. vi. 17, Charge them that are rich in the world, that they be not
   high-minded.' Moses saith, Deut viii. 12-14, Take heed when thou hast
   eaten, and art full, and thy gold and silver is multiplied, lest thy
   heart be lifted up.' Our hearts are mighty apt to be lifted up by a
   full estate.

   [3.] If we excel in gifts and graces, double caution is necessary; this
   is a real excellency, 2 Cor. xii. 7. Pride maketh us not only
   unthankful to God, but perverse to men: Prov. xxi. 24, Proud and
   haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath.' Men conceited
   of their gifts make their own fancy and conceit their rule; and if
   anything be done that pleaseth not them, they rend and tear all, and
   trample upon the unquestionable interest of Jesus Christ to wreak their
   spleen.

   It is a question whether real grace may make a men proud. Gifts, to be
   sure, may: Knowledge puffeth up;' yea, grace, through corruption. They
   need caution that have the great presence of God with them as to
   success when eminently employed in God's service. Credit by worldly
   eminency and esteem falleth in with their services, and secretly
   insinuates high thoughts of their own excellences.

   [4.] Consider how much pride hath cost us. They that are proud and
   burdensome to other people, God will pull down their pride: Isa. xiii.
   11, And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
   their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
   and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.' It is spoken of the
   Chaldeans, who in bravery and force offered violence to others. God
   loveth to pull down the pride and insolency of roysterers, that have
   been formidable and burdensome to other people. The Lord of hosts hath
   purposed to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt
   the honourable of the earth. What hath God been doing, not in former,
   but latter times?

   [5.] Consider that Christianity was sent into the world not to set up a
   kingdom of power, but patience. Mat. xviii. 4, Whosoever, therefore,
   shall be humble as this little child, the same is greatest in the
   kingdom of heaven;' Luke i. 51-53, He hath showed strength with his
   arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart; he
   hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
   degree; he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he
   hath sent empty away.'

   [6.] Consider who made us differ: 1 Cor. iv. 7, For who made thee to
   differ from another? and what hast thou that thou hast not received?
   Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not
   received it?' Who would be proud of a borrowed garment? he becometh the
   more in debt. Nothing is ours but sin, all other things are the free
   gift of God. Shall the wall boast itself because the sun shines upon
   it? or the pen arrogate the praise of fair writing? The more we have
   received from God the more we are obliged to acknowledge his goodness,
   and confess our own unworthiness.

   Secondly, The event, or effect of God's providence desired, together
   with the reason of it. That which he desired was that they might be
   ashamed;' the reason, because they have dealt perversely without a
   cause.' Let us explain both.

   1. The event of God's providence prayed for, that they may be ashamed;
   that is, that they may not prosper and succeed in their attempts; for
   men are ashamed when they are disappointed, and all their endeavours
   for the extirpation of God's people are vain and fruit less, and those
   things which they have subtlely devised have not that effect which they
   propounded unto themselves: Ps. lxx. 3, Let them be turned back for a
   reward of their shame, which say, Aha!'

   2. The reason urged, For they dealt perversely with me without a
   cause.' The Septuagint hath it adi'kos, unjustly. Ainsworth readeth,
   With falsehood they have depraved me. It implieth two things--(1.) That
   they pretended a cause; (2.) David avoucheth his innocency to God; and
   so, without any guilt of his, they accused, defamed, condemned his
   actions, as is usual in like cases. Elsewhere he complaineth, Ps. lvi.
   5, They every day wrest my words, and their thoughts are against me for
   evil.' They condemned him for wicked, perverted his sayings and doings.
   Men pretend causes of their oppression, heresy, schism, rebellion; but
   mere malice and perverseness of spirit incline them to seek the
   destruction of the people of God.

   Doct. That when the proud are troublesome and injurious to God's
   people, they may boldly commend their cause to God.

   The reasons:--

   1. The effects of their pride are grievous to be borne. Now, it is well
   when any grief findeth a spiritual vent, when it puts the godly upon
   praying: Phil. iv. 6, In everything, by prayer and supplication with
   thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God;' Jer. xx. 12, O
   Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the
   heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I opened my
   cause.' We may exhibit our bill of complaint at God's tribunal, carry
   the fact thither.

   2. The Lord may be appealed unto upon a double account. Partly as he is
   an enemy to the proud, and as a friend to the humble: James iv. 6, God
   resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble:' and Ps.
   cxxxviii. 6, Though the Lord be high, yet he hath a respect to the
   lowly, and the proud he knoweth afar off.' Partly as he is the portion
   of the afflicted and the oppressed: Ps. cxl. 12, I know the Lord will
   maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.' When
   Satan stirreth up his instruments to hate whom the Lord loveth, the
   Lord will stir up his power to protect and defend them. So Ps. x. 14,
   Thou hast seen it, for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it
   with thy hand: the poor committeth himself to thee; thou art the helper
   of the fatherless.' When they have laid forth their desires, poured
   forth their heart before the Lord, they quiet themselves. It is God's
   office, practice, nature, to relieve poor helpless creatures that
   commit themselves to his custody.

   3. Innocency giveth confidence in prayer, when we are molested and
   troubled without a cause. The testimony of conscience giveth boldness
   towards God and men, 2 Cor. i. 12; and Heb. xiii. 18, Pray for us; for
   we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live
   honestly.' If God's children would carry it more holily and meekly,
   they might cut off occasion from them that desire occasion, and in
   their addresses to God experience more humble confidence.

   But is not this a revengeful prayer? Ans. No.

   First, Because directly they pray for their own deliverance, that they
   may more freely serve God by consequence. Indeed, by God's showing
   mercy to his people, the pride of wicked ones is suppressed, Ps. cxix.
   134.

   Secondly, As it concerneth his enemies, he expresseth it in mild terms,
   That they may be ashamed;' that is, disappointed, their counsels,
   hopes, machinations, and endeavours. And therefore it is not against
   the persons of his enemies, but their plots and enterprises; and shame
   and disappointment may do them good. They think to bring in the total
   suppression of God's people; that would harden them in their sins.
   Therefore God's people desire he would not let their innocency be
   trampled upon, but they disappointed, that the proud may be ashamed in
   the failing of their attempts

   Thirdly, The prayers of the faithful for the overthrow of the wicked
   are a kind of prophecies; so that in praying, David doth in effect
   foretell that such as dealt perversely should be ashamed; as a good
   cause will not always be oppressed: Isa. lxvi. 5, But he. shall appear
   to your joy, but they shall be ashamed;' they met with despiteful usage
   at the hand of their brethren, for their loyalty and fidelity to God.

   Fourthly, Saints have a liberty to imprecate vengeance, but such as
   must be used sparingly and with great caution: Ps. lxxi. 13, Let them
   be confounded and consumed who are adversaries to my soul.' Malicious
   enemies may be expressly prayed against.

SERMON LXXXVII.

   But I will meditate in thy precepts. Let those that fear thee turn unto
   me, and those that have known thy testimonies.--Ver. 78, 79.

   WE now come to David's resolution, but I will meditate in thy precepts.
   The word precepts is not taken strictly, but largely, for the whole
   word of God.

   Doct. It is a blessed thing when the molestations we meet with in the
   world do excite us to a more diligent study of the word of God, and a
   greater mindfulness of spiritual and heavenly things.

   1. I shall show what advantages we have by God's word and precepts, for
   the staying and bettering of our hearts.

   2. How this cometh by deep and serious meditation.

   3. How afflictions and troubles in the flesh do quicken us to it.
   First, In the word of God there are notable comforts and supports,

   First, In the word of God there are notable comforts and supports, as
   also clear directions how to carry ourselves in every condition. I
   shall show what good thoughts do become as a ground of comfort and
   support and direction.

   1. That God hath a fatherly care over us. Be once persuaded of that,
   and trouble will not be so grievous and hard to be borne. This our
   Saviour opposeth to worldly cares and fears: Mat. vi. 32, Your heavenly
   Father knoweth that you have need of these things;' and Luke xii. 32,
   Fear not, little flock; it is your Father's good pleasure to give you a
   kingdom.' There are two notions, and they are both Christian, which are
   the great support of the heart under any trouble--adoption and
   particular providence. The heirs of promise are cared for in their
   nonage; and, by the way, once be persuaded of this, and it will allay
   our distrustful cares. Carking and shifting is a reproach to your
   heavenly Father, as if your child should beg or filch. God knoweth our
   wants, is able to relieve them, willing to supply us; this God is my
   Father.

   2. That the humble soul which casts itself into the arms of God's
   providence shall either have a full and final deliverance or present
   support: Isa. xl. 31, They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
   strength.' To wait on the Lord is with patience and tranquillity of
   spirit to expect the performance of the promises. Now these shall have
   what they wait for, or a supply of strength enabling them to bear up or
   hold out when they seem to be clean spent: Ps. cxxiii. 2, Behold, as
   the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, and the eyes
   of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon the
   Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us;' it was in a time when they
   were filled with the contempt of the proud. Let us be patiently
   submissive to God's dispensations, there is hope of help.

   3. That God doth wonderfully disappoint the designs of wicked men: Ps.
   xxxvii. 12, 13, The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon
   him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; for he seeth that his
   day is coming.' Haman's plot was destroyed, so was the conspiracy of
   them that would have killed Paul: There is no wisdom, nor counsel, nor
   understanding against the Lord,' Prov. xxi. 30. What is God now doing
   in heaven but defending his own kingdom? Ps. ii. Wherefore doth Christ
   sit at his right hand, but to promote the affairs of his church, and to
   blast the devices of the wicked? Mat. xvi. 18, The gates of hell shall
   never prevail against it.'

   4. That the proud are near a fall: Prov. xvi. 5, Every one that is
   proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand,
   they shall not go unpunished,' Sometimes they seem to be supported by
   such combined interests, so woven in the laws and constitutions of a
   nation; but who can keep up him whom God will pull down? Pride is a
   sure note and forerunner of destruction, Prov. xvi. 18; Prov. xv. 25,
   The Lord will destroy the house of the proud; but he will establish the
   border of the widow.' Weak and oppressed innocence standeth upon surer
   terms than the proud, though they excel in wealth and opulency.

   5. That God will never leave us wholly destitute, and to difficulties
   insupportable: Heb. xiii. 5, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
   thee;' and 1 Cor. x. 13, God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
   tempted above that you are able to bear; but will with the temptation
   also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.' To the eye
   of sense we are lost and gone and have no helper, but God is never
   wholly gone. Hagar set herself over against the lad, would not go too
   far from him. God seems to throw us away, but he keeps himself within
   sight, he will not totally or finally forsake us.

   6. That God's usual way is by contraries. The gospel way to save is to
   lope, John xvi. 25; Mat. xvi. 25, He that will save his life, shall
   lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, shall find it.'
   Joseph was made a slave that he may be made governor of Egypt; his
   brethren sell him that they may worship him; and he is cast into prison
   that he may be preferred at court. Thus God by shame bringeth to
   honour, by misery to happiness, by sorrow to comfort, and by death to
   life, to teach us to hope against hope, Rom. iv. 18, and to trust in
   him though he kill us, Job xiii. 15; for death is ours, as well as
   other things. If calamities shorten our lives, they hasten our glory.
   Persecution is the nearest way to heaven in the eye of faith, and the
   sword of the enemy is but the key to open the prison doors and let out
   the soul, which hath long desired to be with Christ.

   7. That it is better to suffer than to sin. In suffering, the offence
   is done to us; in sinning, it is done to God. The evil of suffering is
   but for a moment; the evil of sin for ever. In suffering we lose the
   favour of men; in sinning we hazard the favour of God. Suffering
   bringeth inconvenience upon the body, but sinning upon the soul. The
   sinful estate is far worse than the afflicted, Heb. xii. 28; the evil
   of sufferings for the present, the evil of sin for afterwards.

   8. That holiness, faith, meekness, and patience are better treasures
   than any the world can take from us. Certainly a Christian is to reckon
   himself by the inward man; if he have a healthy soul, he may the better
   dispense with a sickly body, 3 John 2. If the inward man be renewed, 2
   Cor. iv. 16, if sore troubles discover reality of grace. Sound and
   saving faith discovered to the soul is better worth than the world's
   best gold, 1 Peter i. 9. If carnal sense were not quickest and
   greatest, we would judge so, and not look to the sharpness of the
   affliction, but to the improvement of it. If the bitter water be made
   sweet; if you be more godly, wise, and religious, it is enough: Heb.
   xii. 11, No affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous;
   nevertheless, afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.' If the loss of
   worldly comforts make us apply ourselves to heavenly consolations; if,
   being disburdened of worldly incumbrances, we go on in our way of
   serving God with more liberty and delight, and, when our dangers are
   greatest, we draw near to God, and adhere to him most closely, and
   being persuaded of his love, vigilancy, and power, with these and such
   kind of thoughts will a man be stocked who is with seriousness and
   delight conversant in the scriptures, and so will go on undisturbed in
   the course of his obedience.

   Secondly, These things must be improved by meditation; so saith David,
   I will meditate on thy precepts.'

   1. Sleepy reason is unuseful to us, and truths lie hid in the heart
   without any efficacy or power till improved by deep, serious, and
   pressing thoughts. Non-attendancy is the bane of the world: Mat. xiii.
   19, When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it
   not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown
   in his heart.' Those invited to the wedding, Mat. xxii. 5, made light
   of it. Men will not suffer their minds so long to dwell upon holy
   things as to procure a good esteem of them; then in seeing they see
   not, and in hearing hear not:' as when you tell a man of a business
   whose mind is taken up about other things. A sudden carrying a candle
   through a room giveth us not so full a survey of the object as when you
   stand a while beholding it. A steady contemplation is a great
   advantage. Attending is the cause of believing, when we grow serious:
   Acts xvi. 14, Whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the
   things spoken by Paul;' Acts xvii. 11, And these were more noble than
   they of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness
   of mind.' If people would often return to consider, they would not be
   hardened in sin: Ps. iv. 4, Commune with your own heart upon your bed:'
   Hag. i. 5, Now, therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your
   ways.' God's complaint was, they would not consider his ways, Job
   xxxiv. 27; Isa. i. 3, My people doth not consider.' Running thoughts
   never work upon us, nor leave any durable impression, like the glance
   of a sunbeam on a wave. When the soul is besieged by a constant battery
   of truths, it yieldeth; but a mind scattered upon impertinent vanities
   groweth not up to any considerable strength of faith, or joy, or
   comfort, or holiness.

   2. God will not be served by the by and at hap-hazard. David taketh a
   resolution to study his duty. The more deliberate our resolutions are
   the better: Ps. cxix. 59, I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto
   thy testimonies.' We shall never stumble upon a good course by chance:
   Isa. lvi. 4, And choose the things that please me;' not take them upon
   some sudden motion, but after mature and serious deliberation.

   3. To divert the mind from other things. Afflictions and troubles stir
   up a multitude of thoughts in us: Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my
   thoughts.' Sometimes self-oppressing thoughts, carking thoughts,
   envious thoughts, and repining at God's providence; the object of our
   trouble is ever before us. Now, there is no way to get rid of these but
   by exercising them upon better things. Troubles make us concerned about
   matters of weight; they employ our minds usefully, which before were
   scattered to impertinent vanities: Ps. xxxix. 3, My heart was hot
   within me; whilst I was musing the fire burned.' That our minds may not
   be a prey to inordinate passions; we pore upon the trouble, and the
   heart is heated like an oven stopped up; and therefore keep the mind
   well employed.

   4. Frequent meditation keepeth our principles in view and memory. We
   are apt to forget in our sorrows: Heb. xii. 5, And ye have forgotten
   the consolation.' It is not ready at hand to support us in the time of
   trouble. A seasonable remembrance of truths is a great relief to the
   soul; it is the Spirit's office.

   Thirdly, That afflictions and molestations have a great tendency and
   subserviency to promote and advance these holy thoughts where they are
   sanctified and work the right way.

   1. They make us understand the word more fully and clearly than before.
   Vexatio dat intellectum; qui tribidantur, saith Luther, sacras literas
   melius intelligunt; securi et fortunati eas legunt, sicut Ovidii
   carmen. A full third part of the scriptures are lost to the secure and
   fortunate.

   2. As they clear the sight, so they purge the taste, and give us a
   spiritual relish. Carnal comforts cloy the spiritual appetite; when,
   they are removed from us, then we taste heavenly things: Ps. xciv. 19,
   In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my
   soul.'

   3. They quicken the heart to our duty, and so make us more awe-ful and
   watchful: Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou chasteneth, O
   Lord, and teachest him out of thy law;' Ps. cxix. 167, My soul hath
   kept thy testimonies, and I love them exceedingly.' If God write his
   law upon our hearts by his stripes on our backs, it is a blessed
   effect. Our happiness is to be measured by our great end, which is
   conformity to God and enjoyment of God; and therefore it doth not
   consist in outward comforts, riches, honour, health, civil liberty, and
   comfortable protection, but acceptance with God, and enjoyment of God.
   Now, as afflictions increase grace and holiness, we are the more
   approved of God, and enjoy more of God.

   Use. Let all our troubles drive us to the word of God; there we shall
   find--

   1. Grounds of comfort and support.

   2. Hopes of deliverance.

   3. Quickenings to duty, which being concocted by serious thoughts, and
   blessed to us by the Spirit of God, will enable us to ride out the
   storm cheerfully, and allay our cares and fears, and then we shall put
   ourselves into the way wherein God hath engaged his protection, and so
   shall not be afraid of what man can do unto us.

   I now come to the 79th verse, let those that fear thee turn unto me,
   and those that have known thy testimonies. When troubled by the wicked,
   he prayeth for the help and comfort of the godly. There is an elegant
   allusion between the two words, yvsv, Let the proud be ashamed; and
   ysvvv, Let the godly be turned to me; that is, let them desert the
   society of these proud men, and join to me.

   In these words God's people are described by a double character--(1.)
   Those that fear thee;' (2.) Those that have known thy testimonies.'
   David's petition concerning those, that they may turn to him. I shall
   deliver the importance of these words in certain propositions.

   1. Observe the godly are described by two properties--the fear or
   worship of God, and the knowledge of his word. Those are godly who fear
   to offend God, and have the sound knowledge of his will; those are
   fittest for God's use in the general, and for David's use in the
   particular condition in which he was. For God's use: Fear and knowledge
   do make up a godly man. Knowledge without fear breedeth presumption,
   and fear without knowledge breedeth superstition and blind zeal, as a
   blind horse may be full of mettle, but is ever and anon stumbling.
   Knowledge must direct fear, and fear must season knowledge, then it is
   a happy mixture and composition. Deum cognoscere et colere--to know
   God, and worship him, is the whole duty of man, saith Lactantius. When
   we know God's testimonies so as to regard, love, and believe them, and
   dare not dispense with our duty to him for all the world, this is a
   good frame; our knowledge and fear of God must be according to his
   word. And these were fittest for David's case; fit comforters and
   strengthened of the godly in persecution. There are many whom we cannot
   exclude from all fear of God, who yet know not his testimonies, run
   into error, darken and blemish a good cause; but those that know and
   fear understand their duty, and are loath to violate it; with these
   should our souls close. Well, then, David doth in effect say, Those
   whom thou hast joined to thyself, let them join to me; they will
   acknowledge the equity of that cause which God owneth, and will
   converse with him whom thou disdainest not to take into favour; because
   they reverence thy providence, and are taught out of thy testimonies;
   and so, weighing the cause, as well as regarding the event, will be
   sooner won to the truth when God showeth mercy to his people; other
   godly ones will be allured to join themselves to those whom they find
   to be so dear to God.

   2. Friendship and fellowship with such godly ones is a great blessing.
   Partly as it conduceth to mutual spiritual strength: Rom. i. 12, That I
   may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and
   me.' It is a comfort to see our Father's children wherever we come, and
   to behold their faith, zeal, self-denial, mortification; the godly are
   a strength to one another in evil times: Mal. iii. 16, Then they that
   feared the Lord spake often one to another.' There are many advantages
   attend the communion of saints; their very sight and presence is a
   confirmation to us. Many times that temptation befalleth' us which
   befell Elias; we think we are left alone, 1 Kings xix. 10, that
   godliness is gone out of the world. To have company is an
   encouragement; but we have not only company, but help. Every one hath
   his peculiar gift to help others, 1 Cor. xii. One hath quickness of
   parts, but not so solid a judgment; another is solid, but not of so
   ready, present, and good utterance: one is zealous, but ungrounded;
   another well-principled, but timorous: 1 Cor. xii. 21, The eye (the
   knowing man) cannot say to the hand (the active man in God's cause), I
   have no need of thee.' All have their use, by mutual gifts and graces,
   to profit one another, as the curtains of the tabernacle were coupled
   to one another by loops, Exod. xxvi. 3, or as a body fitly joined and
   compacted by that which every joint supplieth, Eph. iv. 16. Every
   Christian hath need of another's help. And partly as it conduceth more
   to public safety and honour: Phil. i. 27, 28, Only let your
   conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ, that whether I come
   and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye
   stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the
   faith of the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries,
   which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of
   salvation, and that of God.' When the members are cut off, the body is
   less powerful: Acts iv. 33, And with great power gave the apostles
   witness of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus,' when they were met with
   one heart. And the apostle prayeth, Rom. xv. 5, 6, Now the God of
   patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards
   another, according to Jesus Christ; that ye may with one mind and one
   mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:' as if God
   could not be glorified by them where there is not this amen. Well,
   then, if David did so earnestly desire the company of God's children,
   so should we.

   3. Though it be so great a blessing, yet often it falleth out that
   there are great discords and estrangements between those that fear God
   and know his testimonies; godly men may be strange one to another.
   David complaineth, Ps. lxix. 8, I am become a stranger to my brethren,
   and an alien to my mother's children:' and Ps. xxxviii. 11, My lovers
   and friends stand aloof from my sore;' they stood afar off then when
   wicked men had wounded him. Now this may come to pass--

   [1.] Through carnal fear, as the godly may be deterred by the fear of
   the proud; therefore he desireth they may recover their courage. An
   afflicted condition, as it might increase the violence of the proud, so
   it might diminish the affections of the godly. Affliction is harsh to
   flesh and blood, and good men in their sharpest conflicts may be
   deserted, not only of those who make fair profession, but are really
   godly, and stand in the gap alone. Christ himself hath paved the way;
   he was left alone; so Paul complaineth, 2 Tim. iv. 16, At my first
   answer no man stood with me, but all did forsake me: I pray God it be
   not laid to their charge.' The godly may forsake our fellowship, though
   they wish well to us when we are persecuted, as the rest of the herd
   forsake the wounded deer; they may shrink from us and our afflictions.
   It will be a great mercy if owned in our troubles. Paul took notice of
   Onesiphorus's noticing ashamed of his chain, when some turned away, 2
   Tim. i. 15, 16.

   [2.] They may be alienated by prejudice. Persons truly godly may be
   deceived by the proud. His enemies had depraved his cause; as in the
   former verse, his enemies represented him as a strange person: so they
   might be seduced by their slanders, and so engage against him, till
   they were disabused and reduced, as now he beggeth God in mercy to do
   for him. The equity of my cause being known, let them join themselves
   to me; as Job to his friends: Job vi. 29, Return, I pray you, let it
   not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it;' that
   is, in this matter. Every good man would desire this; but David was the
   head of the party, and chief of the godly's sight. Often it falleth out
   that the godly may take distaste and offence at us.

   [3.] There may be some offence given by us. Chrysostom and Theodoret
   think it relateth to David's sin after he had committed adultery with
   Bathsheba, and plotted the murder of Uriah. Theodoret thinks that he
   was withdrawn or separated from the communion of the church, according
   to his foul act; and therefore prayeth for a redintegration, and that
   they might return to intimacy with him again, and lie gathereth it from
   Symmachus's translation, who doth not read it, Let them turn unto me,
   but Let them converse with me as freely as before. Thus the disciples
   were offended with Paul, till God hardened [5] their hearts towards
   him, Acts ix. 13. Saul was ashamed to see any of those whom he had
   persecuted; Ananias was afraid, as the lamb to come near the wolf, till
   God prepared both by an internal vision; so ver. 21-27.

   [4.] From difference in judgment about lesser things. We should, Phil.
   iii. 15, 16, Be thus minded; and if in anything ye be otherwise minded,
   God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereto we have
   already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same
   things.' There should be a union in heart, way, and scope, Rom. xiv.,
   but often it doth fall out that passion, because of lesser differences,
   may occasion an unkindness between very brethren: Acts xv. 37-39, And
   Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. But
   Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them
   from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. And the contention
   was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the
   other; and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus.' That
   paroxysm between Paul and Barnabas.

   [5.] From the providence of God permitting it for wise reasons. Job
   owneth God in it: Job xix. 13, 14, He hath put my brethren far from me,
   and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have
   failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.' So doth Heman: Ps.
   lxxxviii. 8, Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou
   hast made me an abomination to them.' Partly to humble us and try us,
   for our depending too much upon man, and making us ourselves again with
   our party. A winnowing storm may be sent to this purpose. We think our
   faith and resolution strong, now God will try how we can stand alone.
   And partly to drive us to God: 1 With thee the fatherless find mercy,'
   Hosea xiv. 3; Ps. lx. 11, Give us help from trouble; for vain is the
   help of man;' Ps. xii. 1, Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth; the
   faithful fail from among the children of men.' We shall not have too
   much comfort by any creature, to turn us to believe in God alone. We
   are prone to look to the creature, and to have our hearts drawn away
   from God. And partly to conform us to Jesus Christ: John xvi. 32,
   Behold the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered,
   every man to his own, and shall leave me alone:' Mat. xxvi. 56, But all
   this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
   Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.' This is part of the
   bitter cup.

   4. When this falleth out, we should use all due means to recover those
   that have deserted us, and draw them unto us again; the favour is worth
   diligence. A man would not be cast out of the hearts of God's people.
   The apostle saith, Heb. xii. 14, Follow peace with all men,' dio'kete
   eire'nen, not only embrace it when it is offered to us, and fairly
   droppeth into our mouths, but pursue it with earnestness;. we must
   pursue it as a man pursueth something running from him to take it. It
   is explained, Ps. xxxiv. 14, Seek peace, and pursue it.' If the issue
   answer not our first attempt, we must seek it again; not giving up the
   cause for desperate, lest despair quench our endeavours.

   5. One great means to recover a good understanding among God's people
   is prayer. David goeth to God about it, Lord, let them turn to me.' The
   Lord governeth hearts and interests, both are in his hands, and useth
   this alienation or reconciliation either for judgment or mercy. God,
   when he pleaseth, can divert the comfort of godly friends, and when he
   pleaseth he can bring them back again to us. The feet of God's children
   are directed by God himself: if they come to us it is a blessing of
   God; if not, it is for a correction. He made Jacob and Laban meet
   peaceably, Gen. xxxi., and in the next chapter Jacob and Esau.

   Use. The use is direction to us in these times, when there are such
   distances and alienation of hearts and affections between the people of
   God.

   1. Let us not be troubled at it over-much. Godly men were estranged
   from David, either being misled by delusions and false reports, or
   loath to come to him because of his troubles and low condition. And
   partly because it is no strange thing for a good man to be forsaken of
   his friends; so Job, chap. vi. 15-17 Mv brethren have dealt deceitfully
   as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away, which are
   blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: what time
   they wax warm, they vanish; when it is hot, they are consumed out of
   the way;' so David: Ps. xxxi 11 I was a reproach among all mine
   enemies, and a fear to mine acquaintance;' yea, so Christ himself. I
   know the temptation is very great. Man is zoon poli'tikon, a sociable
   creature. To go alone in our duty is very hard; but we ought not to
   look on ourselves to be alone while God is with us, John xvi. 32.
   Christ is a pattern of all dispensations as well as trials: Heb. xiii.
   5, I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.' He is so far from
   forsaking, that he will not leave us.

   2. Let us recommend the case to God: Zeph. iii 9, That they may call
   upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent;' Rom. xv. 6,
   7, That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God: wherefore
   receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of
   God.' Non sunt ista litigandi, sed orandi tempora. Beg a coalition of
   all those that fear God, that, laying aside prejudice, they may turn
   one to another. The spirit of concord is God's gift. Christ prayeth,
   John xvii. 21, 22, That they may be one, as thou, Father, art in me,
   and I in thee; that they also may be one in us, that the world may
   believe thou hast sent me: and the glory which thon gavest me, I have
   given them, that they may be one as we are one.'

   3. Let us carry it so that the children of God may have no occasion to
   turn from us. Scandalous sins are roots of bitterness: Heb. xii. 15,
   Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many
   be defiled.' Encourage the godly to pray for you: Heb xiii. 18, Pray
   for us; for we trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing
   to live honestly.' To love you. Good men are not unworthy of our
   prayers, and incapable of the benefit of them; the more you excel in
   grace the more they will delight in you: Ps. xvi. 3, But to the saints
   that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my
   delight.'

SERMON LXXXVIII.

   Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.--Ver. 80.

   IN this verse we have--(1.) a petition, let my heart be sound in thy
   statutes; (2.} An argument from the fruit and effect of granting it,
   that I be not ashamed; that is, then I shall not, otherwise I
   certainly, shall, be ashamed. He would avoid that inconveniency that
   was so grievous to him in the eyes of wicked men.

   First, In the petition I shall take notice--

   1. Of the person praying, David.

   2. His qualification, intimated in the word my heart.

   3. The person prayed unto, intimated in the word thy.

   Secondly, Here is the benefit asked, a sound heart; in which you have--

   1. The nature of it.

   2. The value of it.

   Doct. That sincerity and soundness in a holy course is a great
   blessing, and earnestly to be sought of God in prayer.

   First, This will appear if we consider the benefit asked, the nature
   and value of it.

   First, The nature of it, what is a sound heart? It noteth reality and
   solidity in grace. The Septuagint hath it, Let my heart be without spot
   and blemish; what is here, Let my heart be sound. It implieth the
   reality of grace, opposed to the bare form of godliness, or the fair
   shows of hypocrites, and the sudden and vanishing motions of
   temporaries.

   1. I shall briefly show what it is not, by way of opposition.

   [1.] It is opposed to the form of godliness: 2 Tim. iii. 4, Having a
   form of godliness, but denying tire power thereof.' Their religion is
   only in show and outside, as apples, that may be fair to see to in the
   skin, but rotten at the core; so their hearts are not sound within.
   When we are sound within as well as beautiful without, this is the
   sound heart; when not only in show and appearance we are for God, but
   in deed and truth. Solinus telleth us that the apples of Sodom are to
   sight very beautiful and fair, but the compass of the rind doth only
   contain a sooty matter, which flitters into dust as soon as touched.
   This is a fit emblem of a hypocrite, or a heart not sound with God. Or,
   as the priests under the law, they were to look whether the sacrifices
   were sound at heart, otherwise they were to be rejected, Lev. xxii. 22,
   23. So David here begs a sound heart in God's statutes, lest it should
   be rejected of God. The world thinketh, if there be a little external
   conformity to the law of God, it is enough. Oh, no! There must be a
   sound heart; no other principle of obedience pleaseth God.

   [2.] This sound heart is opposed to the sudden pangs and hasty motions
   of temporaries. The graces of temporaries are for matter true, but
   slightly rooted, and therefore are not sound. There wanteth two things
   in the graces of temporaries--(1.) A deep and firm radication; (2.) A
   habitual predominancy over all lusts.

   (1.) A deep and firm indication. Temporaries are really affected with
   the word of God, and the offers of Christ, and life by him; but the
   tincture is but slight, and soon worn off; they have the streams of
   grace, but not the fountain; a draught, but not the spring: John iv.
   14, The water that I shall give him shall be a well of water springing
   up to everlasting life.' A dash of rain or a pond may be dried up, but
   a fountain ever keepeth flowing. They have something to do with Christ;
   he giveth them a visit, but not that constant communion; he doth not
   dwell in their hearts by faith,' Eph. iii. 17, nor take up his abode
   there; it is but a slight tincture, not a deep and permanent dye of
   holiness, or a constant habitual inclination to that which is holy,
   just, and good. There is not the remaining seed, 1 John iii. 9. There
   is a great deal of difference between sudden motions stirred up m us by
   the Spirit, and the remaining seed; that is, a constant disposition of
   heart to please God.

   (2.) A habitual predominancy over all lusts. Temporaries still, with
   those kind graces which they have, retain their interest in the world,
   and their inclinations to the pleasures, honours, and profits thereof,
   unbroken and unsubdued; as Simon Magus cherisheth the same corruptions
   under his new faith that he did under his old sorceries, Acts viii.;
   still he did desire to be thought some great one among the people. You
   must not think that he altogether dissembled, but he had some sense
   upon him, for he believed, and beheld the miracles, and wondered; but
   the same inclinations remained with him. Evermore some temporal
   interest or worldly advantage is laid closer to the heart, and hath a
   deeper rooting therein than the word of promise; and this m time
   prevaileth over the interest of God. And therefore, whatever good
   affections we have, till we get a command over our base and carnal
   delights, our hearts can never be sound with God.

   2. Positively. What the sound heart is not, or to what it is op posed,
   we have seen. You may from hence easily gather what it is; it is such a
   receiving of the word into the heart that it is rooted there, and
   diffuseth its influence for the seasoning of every affection, and
   beareth a universal sovereignty over us. Sometimes it is described by
   its radication, and sometimes by its sovereign prevailing efficacy.

   [1.] Sometimes it is described by its radication, and so it is called
   lo'gos e'mphutosThe engrafted word, that is able to save our souls,'
   James i. 21. The root of the matter is within; it is not tied on, but
   engrafted: so m that promise of God, Heb. viii. 10, I will put my law
   into their minds, and write it upon their hearts.' There is something
   written: I will write my law; and there are tables, and they are the
   hearts and minds of men; that is, the understanding and the will, or
   the rational appetite; and this with God's own finger: I will write
   upon their hearts and minds. There where is the spring and original of
   all moral operations, of all thoughts, affections, and inward motions,
   there is the law of God written; in those parts of the soul where the
   directive counsel and the imperial commanding power of all human
   actions lieth, there doth God write his laws, and engrave them in
   lively and legible characters. And what is the effect of this, but that
   a man becometh a law to himself? He carrieth his rule about with him
   and as ready and as willing a mind to obey it. So Ps. xxxvii. 31, The
   law of God is m his heart; none of his steps shall slide.' The truth is
   rooted m him, and his heart is suited and inclined to it. He knoweth
   and loveth what is commanded of God, and hateth what is forbidden of
   him: thus a man becometh a bible to himself. Indeed this planting and
   engrafting the law upon our hearts, it sometimes made our work, because
   we use the means. God doth not write his law upon our hearts by
   enthusiasm, rapture, and inspiration, as he wrote m the hearts of the
   apostles and prophets, but maketh use of our reason, reading, hearing,
   meditation, conference, and prayer. It is made our work, because we
   work under God: Ps. cxix. 11, Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I
   might not sin against thee:' and Prov. vi. 21, 22, Bind his
   commandments upon thy heart; tie them upon thy neck.' When we look for
   the deep implanting of the word in our hearts, this is the sound heart
   here described.

   [2.] The efficacy of this word so radicated, and the power and do
   minion it hath over the soul to subdue it to the will of God, and that
   is when the heart is transformed into the nature of God: Rom. vi. 11,
   Ye have obeyed from the heart the form of sound doctrine that was
   delivered unto you.' When the form of the word is delivered to him, he
   delivereth up himself to be moulded and assimilated to the nature of
   it; as that which is cast into the fire is changed into the colour,
   heat, and properties of fire. Thus where the word is incorporated and
   rooted in us, the heart is assimilated to the object seen and discerned
   therein; the image of God is stamped and impressed upon us: 2 Peter i.
   4, Having these great and precious promises, that we might be partakers
   of the divine nature:' and 2 Cor. iii. 18, We are changed into his
   image' (or likeness) from glory to glory, by the Spirit of our God.'
   Well, then, you see what the sound heart is.

   But yet more distinctly, if you would have me untold what this sound
   heart is, there is required these four things:--

   1. An enlightened understanding; that is the directive part of the
   soul; and it is sound when it is kept free from the leaven and
   contagion of error: Prov. xv. 21, A man of understanding walketh
   uprightly.' A sound mind is a good help to a sound heart. Light
   breedeth an awe of God, and mindeth us of our duty upon all occasions:
   1 Chron. xxviii. 9, And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy
   fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind.' First
   know him, and then serve him. He can never shoot right that taketh his
   aim contrary. The understanding doth direct all the inferior powers of
   the soul; if that be infected with error, the affections must
   necessarily move out of order. A blind horse may be full of mettle, but
   is ever and anon apt to stumble; and therefore, Without knowledge the
   heart is not good,' Prov. xix. 2.

   2. There is required an awakened conscience; that warneth us of our
   duty, and riseth up in dislike of sin upon all occasions: Prov. vi. 22,
   When thou goest it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest it shall keep
   thee; when thou walkest it shall talk with thee:' to have a constant
   monitor in our bosoms to put us in mind of God; when our reins preach
   to us in the night season, Ps. xvi. 7. There is a secret spy in our
   bosoms, that observes all that we do, and think, and speak, a
   domestical divine that is always preaching to us; his heart is his
   bible. Such an awakened conscience is a bridle before sin, to keep us
   from doing things contrary to God; and a whip after sin. If we keep it
   tender, so it will do. Indeed it is easily offended, but it is not
   easily pleased; as the eye, the least dust soon offends it, but it is
   not so easily got out again. Till men have benumbed their consciences,
   and brought a brawn and deadness upon their hearts, their conscience,
   according to its light, will warn them of their danger, and mind them
   of their duty. It is a great mercy to have a speaking, stirring
   conscience, otherwise it is stupid and senseless.

   3. There is required a rightly disposed will, or a steadfast purpose to
   walk with God in all conditions, and to do what is good and accept able
   in his sight: Acts xi. 23, He exhorted them with full purpose of heart
   to cleave to the Lord.' Many have light inclinations or wavering
   resolutions, but their hearts are not fixedly, habitually bent to
   please God. Therein chiefly lieth this sound heart, that doth
   inseparably cleave to God in all things: 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now set
   your hearts to seek the Lord God of your fathers.' This is the
   obediential bent, when the heart is set and fixed. So David speaketh of
   it: Ps. cxix. 112, I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes
   always to the end.' When the heart is poised this way, not compelled by
   outward force, but inclined; and this always, not by fits and starts.
   Many have good motions, and temporise a little, but their righteousness
   is like the morning dew. Many approve what is good, and condemn
   themselves for not doing of it, but their hearts are not inclined; nay,
   further, they can wish it were better with them, but the heart is not
   swayed and overpowered by grace. Here is the ground of a cheerful,
   uniform, and constant obedience, when we do not force ourselves now and
   then to good actions, but the heart hath a habitual tendency that way.

   4. There is required that the affections be purged and quickened; these
   are the vigorous motions of the will, and therefore this must be
   needfully regarded: purged they must be from that carnality and
   fleshliness that cleaveth to them. This is called in scripture the
   circumcision of the heart, Deut. xxx. 6: The Lord thy God shall
   circumcise thy heart, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   with all thy mind, that thou mayest live.' It was figured in the
   cutting of the foreskin, or the circumcision of the flesh, which,
   because it was an action done with pain, sometimes noteth the humbling
   of the heart and soul-affliction, Lev. xxvi. 41; but because it was
   done not only with pain, but the foreskin was cut off, so it noteth the
   purging the heart from that fleshliness and carnality that cleaveth to
   us: Acts xv. 9, Purifying their hearts by faith.' Sin is wrought out
   more and more by the blood of Christ applied to the conscience. And
   some times this is expressed in scripture by ploughing up the fallow
   ground, Jer. iv. 4. There are perverse inclinations, like briars and
   thorns, that grow in us, and the strength of vile affections; now
   unless these be abated and broken we shall soon be transported by them.
   It is an allusion to ground broken up for tillage: till the ground be
   ploughed, and the noisome weeds destroyed, the good seed will not grow.
   Secondly, the affections must be quickened, acted, and set a work by
   the love of God: Gal. v. 6, Prepared ready to serve the Lord,' Eph. ii.
   20. Amor meus est pondus meum--love and delight in God's ways go
   together.

   Thus much of the nature of the sound heart.

   Secondly, Let me now come to show you the value and worth of this
   privilege. It is a great blessing; that will appear by two things:--

   1. The respect that God hath to it.

   2. The evil it freeth us from, That I be not ashamed.'

   1. The respect that God hath to it. This is the thing that God delights
   in and looks after: 1 Chron. xxix. 17, I know also, my God, that thou
   triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.' He can discern
   integrity, and preferreth it before all manner of service and pomp in
   worship that is yielded to him. Now this delight of God is not only in
   the thing itself, in the uprightness, but in the persons of the
   upright, upon account of their uprightness: so Prov. xi. 20, The
   upright is his delight.' That person that is upright for the main,
   though otherwise he hath many failings, is of great esteem with God.
   But can the holy God delight in any of the sinful sons of Adam? Before
   the fall God rejoiced in us, as in the work of his hands. But since sin
   marred us and defiled us, how can God take pleasure in us? The love of
   good-will may fall upon sinful unworthy creatures, but the love of
   complacency cannot fall upon these. A fit object the sinner is not, and
   exactly perfect none can be; there is therefore a middle person, the
   upright and sincere man; and this delight of God passeth from the
   person to his actions: The prayer of the upright is his delight,' Prov.
   xv. 8. Alas! our prayers are, as our persons, poor slender things at
   the best; yet a little findeth acceptance with God; it is welcome for
   the person's sake, who is accepted in Christ. Now, how will God
   manifest this delight? In his providence: 2 Chron. xvi. 9, The eyes of
   the Lord run to and fro, that he may show himself strong in the behalf
   of those whose hearts are upright with him.' He looks up and down in
   the world to find out such persons to do them good, that he may employ
   all his power and grace for them: so God shows it in his word. God's
   work is to assure them of a blessing: Micah ii. 7, Do not my words do
   good to them that walk uprightly?' There he comforts, and strengthens,
   and revives their hearts. He doth not only speak good, but doth good to
   them that walk uprightly. Nay, that is not all, but by his Spirit and
   internal grace he doth more encourage them, and renew strength upon
   them in their way to heaven: Prov. x. 29, The way of the Lord is
   strength to the upright.' The more they walk with God, the more easy
   and sweet they find it so to do. So that if all these promises will
   encourage us, we had need to look after this sound heart. What honour
   and esteem soever others purchase with men, these obtain favour with
   the Lord, and are more regarded in all his dispensations.

   2. Let us come to the evil it freeth us from; in the argument of the
   text, That I may not be ashamed.' They whose hearts are not sound with
   God, one time or other they shall be put to shame; but others shall be
   kept from this effect, which is so grievous to nature. Let me open
   this. A man may be ashamed either before God or men, ourselves or
   others.

   [1.] Before God, either in our addresses to him at the throne of grace,
   or when summoned to appear at the last day before the tribunal of his
   justice.

   (1.) If you understand it of our present approach to him, we cannot
   come into his presence with confidence if we have not a sound heart: I
   John iii. 21, If our hearts condemn us not, then have we boldness
   towards God.' We lose that holy familiarity and cheerfulness, when we
   are unbosoming ourselves to our heavenly Father, when our hearts are
   not sound. An unsound heart, through the consciousness of its own
   guilt, groweth shy of God, and stands aloof from him, and hath no
   pleasure in his company. But when we sincerely set ourselves to keep a
   good conscience in all things, we have this liberty towards God; though
   our failings humble us, yet they do not weaken our confidence of our
   Father's mercy. St Paul thought himself a fit object of others' prayers
   on this account: Heb. xiii. 18, Pray for us; for we trust we have a
   good conscience, willing in all things to live honestly.' That is his
   argument to prove that he was not altogether unworthy of their prayers,
   nor incapable of the benefit of their petitions. There are some whom no
   prayers or intercession can help or profit, some that have no
   encouragement to pray for themselves, or give others an encouragement
   to pray for them. But Paul was none of these. Why? Because the reason
   of his request is modestly expressed. He doth not say, I have, but I
   trust I have, a good conscience:' and he doth not justify himself in
   all things, but appeals to the bent of his will, Willing in all things
   to live honestly.' He was willing so to do, that is, to direct his life
   according to the will of God in all things; his heart was willingly
   disposed and predominantly bent unto righteousness, and he knew it to
   be so. Such may, without blushing, come into God's presence, and have
   encouragement to pray for themselves, and encourage others to pray for
   them.

   (2.) When we are summoned to appear before the tribunal of his justice.
   Many now with a bold impudence will obtrude themselves upon the worship
   of God, because they see him not, and have not a due sense of his
   majesty; but the time will come when the most impudent and outbraving
   sinners will be astonished, even then, when the secrets of all hearts
   shall be laid open and made manifest, and hidden things brought to
   light,' 1 Cor. iv. 5. And every one is to receive his judgment from
   God, according to what he hath done, either good or evil. Conscience
   now, like a clock when the weights are down, is silent, and makes no
   noise; but then it shall speak, and tell men their own, and then they
   will be ashamed; unsound hearts will not be able to stand in the
   judgment. When God sets any judicial judgment afoot in the world now,
   it reviveth men's guilty fears: Isa. xxxiii. 14, The sinners in Zion
   are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrite: who among us
   shall dwell with devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with
   everlasting burnings?' In some terrible judgments that are a foregoing
   pledge of judgment to come, men of an unsound heart are soon possessed
   with fears and frights, as the unsound parts of the body are pinched
   most in searching weather. When God's wrath is once kindled, none so
   terrified and amazed as they. Much more at the great day, when there is
   no allaying of their fear, and they must undergo the final judgment of
   the most impartial God. Who will be able to hold up the head, and to
   say, Then shall I not be ashamed'? They that unfeignedly give up
   themselves to do the whole will of God: Ps. cxix. 6, Then shall I not
   be ashamed when I have respect to all thy commandments.' A man that
   desires to do the whole will of God will not be confounded and amazed
   with terror before the judge of all the earth. The philosopher defines
   shame to be a fear of a just reproof. Who more just than the. judge of
   all the earth? and when is there a greater reproof in the conviction of
   sinners than at the last judgment?

   [2.] Before men a man may be ashamed; and so before ourselves and
   others.

   (1.) Ourselves. It was a saying of Pythagoras, Reverence thyself. Be
   ashamed of thyself. God hath a spy and deputy within us, and taketh
   notice of our conformity and inconformity to his will, and after sin
   committed, lasheth the soul with the sense of its own guilt and folly,
   as the body is lashed with stripes: Rom. vi. 21, What fruit have ye in
   those things whereof ye are now ashamed?' There is an emphasis in the
   particle now; that is, now after grace received, or now after the
   commitment of sin. Take either sense. Sin enticeth us before we fall
   into it, but afterwards it flasheth terror in the face of the sinner,
   and filleth his soul with horror and shame; or now, after grace
   received, a Christian cannot look back upon his past life without shame
   and blushing. Tertullian hath a saying, that a man's heart reproacheth
   him when lie doth evil. As soon as our first parents had sinned, they
   were ashamed of it, and sought fig-leaves to cover it; they seek to
   hide with the leaves what the fruit had uncovered. Well, then, there is
   an eye and an ear that seeth and heareth our secret sins, and lasheth
   the soul for them till we grow into a sturdy impudence. But now the
   upright man, that sets his heart to serve the Lord and do his will,
   hath comfort and peace in himself: 2 Cor. i. 12, This is our rejoicing,
   that, in simplicity and godly sincerity, we have had our conversation
   in the world.' He can look his conscience in the face without fear and
   amazement. He hath sorrow for his failings, but can look upon himself
   as sound before God for the main.

   (2.) Before others; and so our shame may be occasioned by our scandals
   or our punishment: it is hard to say which is intended here.

   (1st.) By scandals. When the heart is not sound with God, disorders
   break out before men, and many that make a fair show for a while
   afterwards shipwreck themselves and all their credit; for God will at
   length uncase the hypocrite, Prov. xxvi. 26; God will pull off his
   disguise one time or other, and that which is counterfeit cannot long
   be hidden; there will a time of dissection come, when that which is
   hidden shall' be made manifest. The apostle telleth us that that which
   is lame is soon turned out of the way,' Heb. xii. 13. Men of an unsound
   heart have some temptations or other to carry them quite off from God,
   and then, as old Eli, they fall back, and break the neck of their
   profession, whereby they dishonour God and shame themselves. As Christ
   telleth us of the builders, that the house fell, and great was the fall
   of it; so these, by some shameful and scandalous fall, discover
   themselves to the world.

   (2d.) There is a shame before others by their punishment and
   disappointment of their hopes. God's punishment, in the language of
   scripture, is a putting to shame: Ezek. xxxvi. 7, When the heathens
   that are about you shall bear their shame.' So Jer. xiii. 26, I will
   discover thy skirts that thy shame may appear.' So when God visits his
   people for scandalous and enormous offences: Ps. xliv. 9, Thou hast
   cast us off, and put us to shame.' The reason of that expression is
   this: A man in misery is a laughing-stock to others, and exposed to
   contempt and ignominy. Especially is this a shame to God's people, when
   they seem to be disappointed in the hope of protection and assistance
   which they expected from God; then God puts them to shame, makes them
   to be a despised people. And this is their portion whose hearts are not
   sound and upright with God; they are rejected of the Lord, and grow
   despicable. Well, then, the point is made good by what hath already
   been said; but now the other circumstance.

   Secondly, Here is the qualification of the person asking, David.

   1. David was a holy, good man, Acts xiii. 22. He goes and begs Let my
   heart be sound.' The hearts of the best men are so perverted with
   natural corruption, which is not fully abolished in any, that they have
   need to pray for a sound heart: Eph. iv. 22, Put off the old man with
   his deceitful lusts.' The old man is not so put off but there will be
   many warpings and deceitful workings still, and therefore David prays
   thus. The more upright any man is, the more sensible of his weakness,
   and the more suspicious of his own heart's deceitfulness. The best have
   lodged sin, vanity, and pleasures, and the world in their hearts, which
   are the closets that should be kept entirely for the Lord. They find
   their purposes towards that which is good very weak, their resolutions
   variable, their inclinations to evil very strong: Prov. xx. 9, Who can
   say, My heart is clean?' And therefore they go to God, if there be any
   degree of insincerity, any spared sin, any remainings of lust not
   striven against and not bewailed, that lie would discover it, and
   mortify it, that they may be more steadfast, being sensible of their
   fickleness and turning aside in the several conditions they pass
   through.

   2. This was the request of David, who was so much in the knowledge and
   study of God's law, and had so often said, Teach me thy statutes,' now
   Make me sound in thy statutes.' Sound knowledge of the statutes of God,
   and a sound purpose of heart to follow them, must be joined together.
   Affection without knowledge is not good, much less knowledge without
   affection and practice. All our knowledge will but increase our
   punishment, Luke xii. 48, and take away all pretences of excuse. First
   a heart enlightened, and then a heart bent: David often prays for both
   in this psalm; so must we pray, that as we have greater knowledge than
   others, so we may have better affections than others, and our hearts
   more upright. If ye know these things, happy are you if you do them,'
   John xiii. 17. God's scope in giving the law, was not to make trial of
   men's wits, who could most sharply conceive; nor of their memories, who
   could most faithfully retain; nor of their eloquence, who could most
   neatly discourse; but of their hearts, who could most obediently submit
   to his statutes. Stars were not made for sight only, but influence. So
   man was not created to know only, but to walk according to his
   knowledge. God's precepts are best learned when most circumspectly
   practised.

   3. This was the request of David, a man afflicted, opposed, and
   persecuted. Compare the text with the 78th verse, Let the proud be
   ashamed; for they have dealt perversely with me.' Let my heart be sound
   in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.' Above all things we should
   study to be sincere in our carriage and defence of a good cause. An
   unsound heart will not bear out, but fall off to its own shame: James
   i. 8, The apostle telleth us, that a double-minded man is unstable in
   all his ways.' Between God's supplies and carnal shifts he goeth
   backward and forward, or this way and that, as occasion requireth. We
   need truth of grace, that we may be able to endure all weathers; and
   when we are put to trial we should be the more earnest with God for
   soundness of heart.

   Thirdly, Here is the person of whom it is asked--of God: Make my heart
   sound in thy statutes.' Uprightness is the gift of God, and the work of
   his Spirit: Ps. li. 10, Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right
   spirit within me.' We are like a pewter vessel, battered by the fall;
   and till we be cast anew we cannot be right with God. God worketh it in
   us at first, and still keepeth us and guideth us by his Spirit, or else
   we shall soon turn aside to our old bent and bias again. God beginneth
   the work of holiness, and maintaineth it against remaining corruption
   and outward temptations; he still keepeth afoot a constant purpose, and
   steady endeavour in the heart, to walk so as may please God. Men of
   themselves have a kind of humour towards good for a fit; but to go on
   sincerely to the end needeth grace from above.

   Use. To press us to look after this firm established spirit. Now to
   this purpose--

   1. Heartily resign yourselves to be directed and guided by God in all
   things whatsoever: Ezra vii. 10, He prepared his heart to seek the
   Lord.' To do it needeth such a fixed purpose.

   2. Let us offer ourselves to God's trial. Ps. cxxxix. 23, 24, Search
   me, O Lord, and try me, know my heart and know my thoughts, see if
   there be any way of wickedness in me.' We must not only rest upon the
   testimony of our own consciences, but desire our hearts may be searched
   by God over and over. Besides, there are many ill humours mixed with
   our best affections, which we see not, and a secret approbation and
   indulgence we give to them. We are apt ever to deal favourably with
   ourselves; and therefore desire God to pry into your most retired and
   reserved thoughts.

   3. Let us walk still as in God's eye: Ps. cxix. 168, I kept thy
   precepts and thy testimonies, for all my ways are before thee.'
   Whatever praise we have with men, we must see that our hearts be right
   with God, who is witness, approver, and judge, and searcheth the heart,
   and trieth the reins, and will not be put off with shadows; God's
   all-seeing eye is a special means to make a man upright.

   4. Observe how often we step awry, Jer. xvii. 9, in those actions we
   perform. How careless are we of the spiritual part; we regard the
   outside of the duty, but slightly pass over that affection that should
   accompany it. In resistance of our corruption, we rather deal with the
   fruit of it, that it break not out to our disgrace, than the root of it
   that secretly lurketh in our hearts. There is a great deal of guile of
   spirit in the best, and therefore we had need to make straight steps to
   our feet,' Heb. xii. 13. There is some defect in matter, manner, or
   aim. We are many times set awork by others, yet expect wages of God.

   5. Let us be often and earnestly dealing with God for this sincere
   heart; it is called godly sincerity,' 2 Cor. i. 12. Why? Because it
   comes from God, and carries the soul to God again. The new man is
   created in righteousness and true holiness, after the image of God,'
   Eph. iv. 24, and hath a tendency in it to draw us to God again.

SERMON LXXXIX.

   My soul fainteth for thy salvation; but I hope in thy word.--Ver. 81.

   THIS verse is wholly narrative, and consists of two branches:--

   1. The first clause showeth how he stood affected to God's salvation,
   my soul fainteth for thy salvation.

   2. His support till that affection was satisfied, but I hope in thy
   word.

   Before we can make any further progress in explaining and applying this
   scripture, we must first see what is this salvation which is here
   spoken of. Salvation in scripture hath divers acceptations; it is put--

   1. For that temporal deliverance which God giveth, or hath promised to
   give, to his people. So it is taken Exod. xiv. 13, Stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord that he will show you to-day:' that is, the
   wonderful deliverance which he will work for you. So Lam. iii. 26, It
   is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation
   of the Lord:' meaning by salvation, their recovery out of captivity. It
   was their duty to wait for this deliverance; and though it were long
   first, yet, having a promise, they were to keep up their hope.

   2. For the exhibition of Christ in the flesh: Ps. xcviii. 2, 3, The
   Lord hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly
   showed in the sight of the heathen. He hath remembered his mercy and
   truth to the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the
   salvation of our God.' Clearly that psalm containeth a prediction of
   the setting up of Christ's kingdom, and a bringing of the Gentile world
   into subjection to it; which was first to be offered to the people of
   the Jews, and from thence to be carried on throughout all the regions
   of the world. So old Simeon expresseth himself, Luke ii. 29, 30, Lord,
   now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
   for mine eyes have seen thy salvation:' meaning thereby Christ actually
   exhibited or born in the flesh, which was the beginning of the kingdom
   of the Messiah.

   3. For the benefits which we have by Christ on this side heaven; as the
   pardon of sin, and the renovation of our natures; these are called
   salvation, as Mat. i. 21, He shall save his people from their sins;'
   and Titus iii. 5, He hath saved us by washing in the laver of
   regeneration:' and in the Old Testament, Ps. li. 12, Restore unto us
   the joy of thy salvation:' that is, the joy which we have because God
   hath freed us from our sins.

   4. For everlasting life: Heb. v. 9, He is become the author of eternal
   salvation to all them that obey him:' and 1 Peter i. 9, Receiving the
   end of your faith, the salvation of your souls:' meaning thereby our
   final reward.

   The text is applicable to all these. But (1.) Most simply we must
   expound it of salvation in the first sense, because the drift of the
   man of God in this octonary is to show how he was affected; since God
   heard him not at the first cry, or as soon as he prayed for
   deliverance: though he prayed for deliverance, yet the help promised
   and hoped for was delayed so long, till he was ready to faint, and had
   fainted altogether, but that the promise revived and kept up his hopes.
   (2.) If these words be supposed to be spoken by the church, and in her
   name, they fitly represent the longings of the Old Testament fathers
   after Christ's coming in the flesh. For as David expresseth himself
   here, so doth old Jacob: Gen. xlix. 18. I have waited for thy
   salvation, O Lord.' That speech cometh in there by way of interruption,
   for as he was blessing his children, he turneth to the Lord, desiring
   his salvation by Christ, of which Samson, be longing to the tribe of
   Dan (the tribe which he was then blessing), was a special type. So it
   is said of Abraham, John viii. 56, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
   my day; and he saw it, and was glad.' Abraham knowing him to be the
   true Messiah, did earnestly desire to see that day, and to his great
   contentment got a sight of it by faith; it was a sweet and blessed
   sight to him. So Luke x. 24, Many prophets and kings have desired to
   see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear
   those things which ye hear, and have not heard them:' that is, David, a
   king, and other prophets longed for this day. So Heb. xi. 13, Having
   seen the promises afar off, they were persuaded of them, and embraced
   them.' Oh! they hugged the promises, saying, These will one day yield a
   saviour to the world. So it is said of all the serious believers of the
   Old Testament, Luke ii. 25, that they waited for the consolation of
   Israel;' that is, for the redemption of the world by the blood of
   Christ, and the pouring out of the Holy Ghost, upon which followed the
   calling of the Gentiles and the setting up of the kingdom of God in the
   world. These things the saints longed for, waited for; and because the
   Lord suspended the exhibition of them till the fulness of time, and did
   not presently satisfy their desires, they might be said to faint; but
   the promise kept up their faith in waiting and confidence. I cannot
   wholly exclude this sense, because the salvation promised at the coming
   of the Messiah was the greatest, and common to all the faithful. They
   had many discouragements in expecting it from the wickedness and
   calamities of that people from whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ
   was to descend. But though they were ready to faint, they did not give
   over the hope of that salvation, having God's word for it, and the
   remembrance of it kept afoot by the sacrifices and types of the law.
   (3.) Since Christ hath appeared in the flesh, and hath wrought
   salvation for us, we must wait, and long, and look for that part of
   salvation which is yet to be performed; as the deliverance of the
   church from divers troubles, the freedom of particular believers from
   their doubts and fears, and finally our eternal salvation, which shall
   be completed at Christ's second coming. All that have the first-fruits
   of the Spirit are groaning for this and hoping for this, Rom. viii.
   23-25. We are to desire heaven, yet patiently to stay God's time, for
   here is fainting and hoping, or, as the apostle saith, hastening to and
   yet waiting for the coming of the Lord, 2 Peter iii. 12. One is the
   effect of desire, the other of hope; desire hastening, and hope
   waiting.

   These things being cleared, let us first apply the words to temporal
   deliverance. Observe--

   Doct. 1. The afflictions of God's people may be long and grievous
   before any comfort and deliverance cometh. For the affliction continued
   so long upon David that his soul even fainted.

   There are three agents in the afflictions of the saints--(1.) God; (2.)
   Satan; (3.) Wicked men.

   1. God hath many wise reasons why he doth not give audience, or a
   gracious answer at the first call.

   [1.] Because he will try our faith, to see if we can depend upon him
   when it cometh to an extremity. Thus by silence and rebukes Christ
   tried the woman of Canaan, that her faith might appear the more
   gloriously: Mat. xv. 28, Then Jesus answered, and said unto her, O
   woman, great is thy faith.' And by extremities he still trieth his
   children: our graces are never exercised to the life, till we are near
   the point of death; that is faith which can then depend upon God: Job
   xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;' and Ps. xxiii.
   4, Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.' Many of his children are reduced to great straits; there may be no
   meal in the barrel nor oil in the cruse before God helpeth them. There
   may be many mouths to eat little food: John vi. 5, 6, when there was a
   great deal of company, and little provision, Christ asketh one of his
   disciples, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? and this he
   said to prove him, for he himself knew what he would do.' So many a
   poor believer is put to it. Children increase, trading groweth dead,
   supplies fail, what shall they do? They pray, and God giveth no answer.
   This he doth to prove them. It is a strong faith which can hold out in
   such straits and difficulties.

   [2.] To awaken our importunity: Luke xviii. 1, And he spake a parable
   to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint:'
   compared with Luke xi. 8, with the parable ensuing. So again an
   instance in the woman of Canaan, she turneth discouragements into
   arguments. When Christ said, It is not meet to take the children's
   bread, and to cast it to dogs,' she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat
   of the crumbs which fall from their master's table,' Mat. xv. 26, 27.
   So the blind men, Mat. xx. 31, the more they were rebuked, cried the
   more. Rather than his people shall neglect prayer, or grow formal in
   it, God will cast them into great afflictions; as Christ suffereth the
   storm to continue till the ship was almost overwhelmed, that his
   disciples might awaken him, Mat. viii. 25.

   [3.] To make us sensible of our weakness; as Paul, 2 Cor. i. 9, But we
   had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
   ourselves, but in God, which raiseth the dead. We are much given to
   self-confidence, therefore God will break it, and ere he hath done with
   us, make us trust in him alone. There is a twofold strength--natural
   and spiritual.

   (1.) Natural; which ariseth from that courage that is in man as he is a
   reasonable creature. This will hold out till all probabilities be
   spent: Prov. xviii. 14, The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity,
   but a wounded spirit who can bear?' Till a man be struck at the heart,
   his reason will support him.

   (2.) Spiritual; faith, hope, patience. These may be spent when the
   affliction is deep and pressing, and God's help is long delayed. Faith
   is the strength of the soul; as faith decayeth or is tired, the soul
   faints. Faith may be damped, and give up our case for gone, Ps. cxvi.
   11; Ps. xxxi. 22, they throw up all, and think it is in vain to wait
   any longer. Thus will God discover our weakness to ourselves; the
   weakness of our reason, the weakness of our faith. I remember Solomon
   saith, Prov. xxiv. 10, If thou faintest in adversity, thy strength is
   small.' Grievous or long afflictions discover our strength or weakness.
   Some are of a poor spirit, give up at first assault, before their
   strength faileth them; before the probabilities which sense and reason
   offereth are spent. They are lazy, and love their ease. Some are
   negligent, do no make use of the helps of faith; but when evils
   continue long and sit close, the strongest faith is seen to be too
   weak; God by this will humble us.

   [4.] God doth this for his own glory, and that his work may be the more
   remarkable and conspicuous: John xi. 6, 7,' Jesus loved Lazarus, and
   when he heard that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same
   place where he was.' Little love in that, you will say; a man would
   hasten to his dying friend. Christ may dearly love his own, and yet
   delay to help them even in their extremity, till the fit time come
   wherein the mercy may be the more conspicuous. It is said, Eccles. iii.
   11, God hath made everything beautiful in his time.' Before its time,
   God's work seemeth harsh and rough; as a statue when it is first hewn
   out, but in its time it is a curious piece of workmanship. God in his
   own time and way knoweth best how to comfort his people.

   2. It is the devil's design to tire and weary out the people of God,
   and therefore stirreth up all his malice against us: Luke xxii. 31, 32,
   Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
   you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.' The
   devil, if he might have the shaking of us, and liberty to do his worst,
   he would drive us from the faith of Christ, and all hopes by him.

   3. Men are unreasonable in their oppositions, and will not relent nor
   abate anything of their rigour: Zech. i. 15, I was a little displeased,
   and they helped forward the affliction.' They are still adding to the
   church's trouble, and would destroy those whom God would only correct
   and purge, as the slave layeth on unmercifully. Till God restrain it,
   their wrath never ceaseth. Well, then--

   Use 1. Let it not seem strange to us that godly men, in their
   afflictions, though they fly to God and implore his mercy, are not
   presently delivered, nor always at the first instance. God hath many
   discoveries to make, much work to do. Would you have faith rewarded
   before it be tried? or the beautiful frame and link of causes disturbed
   for your sakes? Faith is not tried to purpose till the thing we believe
   is not seen, nor have any probability that ever we shall see it; yea,
   till we see nothing but the contrary, and hope against hope; we must
   stay till the mercy be ready for us, and we ready for it; a hungry
   stomach would have the meat ere it be roasted; our times are always
   present with us, when God's time is not come.

   Use 2. Let us prepare for grievous and tedious sufferings. We would
   turn over our hard lesson before we have sufficiently learned it; we
   love the ease of the flesh, would have no cross, or a very short one.
   Things will not be so soon or so suddenly effected as we imagine. We
   make greater provision for a long voyage. We should be strengthened to
   long-suffering, Col. i. 11, as for all sort of crosses, so for long and
   tedious crosses.

   Use 3. If your affliction be long, observe your carriage under it. Doth
   faith and hope keep you alive still? Heb vi. 12, Be not slothful, but
   followers of them who, through faith and patience, inherit the
   promises.' Do you keep up your prayerful affections? Rom. xii. 12,
   Continue instant in prayer.' We pray as men out of heart, for fashion's
   sake, and with little life, rather satisfying our consciences than
   expressing our hope and confidence. A damp on the spirit of prayer is
   an ill presage. Can you love God though you be not feasted with
   self-comforts and present benefits? Isa. xxvi. 8, Yea, in the way of
   thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee,' &c. Our affections are
   bribed when desired comforts are presently obtained; God will see if we
   purely love him.

   Use 4. For a close to this point. Our sufferings are like to be long; I
   speak not as determining, but to awaken a spirit of prayer that they
   may be shortened. When Christ made as if he would go further, they
   constrained him to tarry, Luke xxiv. 28, 29. These are sad symptoms of
   it.

   1. When reformation is rejected, and corruptions are settling again
   upon their own base: Hosea vii. 1, When I would have healed Israel,
   then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered,' &c.; Ezek. xxiv. 13, In
   thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast
   not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till
   I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.' This crime is not only
   chargeable on them who opposed the Reformation, but on those who, by
   multiplied scandals, dishonoured the cause of God. Instance in the
   Papists in Queen Mary's time, who got in by fraud and violence, not by
   miscarriage of the Protestants. Then it was sharp and short, ours is
   like to be tedious and long.

   2. When our deliverance is likely to prove a mischief and a misery,
   when we are not prepared to receive it. God will not give us things for
   our hurt. And we may fear as much from our brethren, our mutual
   bickerings, as from enemies; when God promises restoration he promiseth
   unity: Zeph. iii. 9, For then will I turn to the people a pure
   language, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him
   with one consent;' Zech. xiv. 9, And the Lord shall be king over all
   the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.' The
   dog is let loose when the sheep scatter.

   3. When there is a damp upon the spirit of prayer, and men give over
   seeking to God for deliverance as a hopeless thing. God is near when
   the spirit of prayer is revived: Ezek. xxxvi. 37, Thus saith the Lord
   God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do
   it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock:' and Jer.
   xxix. 12, 1.3, Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray
   unto me, and I will hearken unto you: and ye shall seek me and find me,
   when ye shall search for me with all your heart;' Dan. ix. 19, 20; and
   Ps. x. 17, Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt
   prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.' Et passim
   alibi.

   4. When God is upon his judicial process, and there is not any course
   taken to reconcile ourselves to him. God hath been judging his people,
   judging the nation wherein they live. Judgment began at the house of
   God. What notable humiliation and reformation hath it produced there?
   There is God's whole work to be done upon Mount Sion, Isa. x. 12. What
   fruit of all those terrible judgments? Incorrigibleness showeth our
   stripes will be many, our judgments long.

   5. When dispensations tend to the removing of the candlestick, or look
   very like it: Rev. ii. 5, Remember therefore from whence thou art
   fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto
   thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except
   thou repent.' That is done either by destroying judgments, taking away
   the subject-matter of the church, or by their own apostasy and
   spiritual fornication, or sad errors and confusions; ill treatment of
   God's people, opposing his interests by his enemies, and the sinful
   miscarriages and apostasies of professing friends, will help to wear
   out an unthankful, murmuring generation.

   Doct. 2. When salvation is delayed, or deliverance long a-coming, the
   soul fainteth.

   I shall show--(1.) The nature of this fainting; (2.) The causes of
   fainting; (3.) The kinds of fainting; (4.) The considerations which may
   preserve us from fainting.

   1. For the nature of this fainting. Here we must inquire what is meant
   by the fainting of the soul. Fainting is proper to the body, but here
   it is ascribed to the soul, as also in many other places. The apostle
   saith, Heb. xii. 3, Lest ye be weary, and faint in your minds;' where
   two words are used, weariness and fainting, both taken from the body.
   Weariness is a lesser, fainting a higher degree of deficiency. In
   weariness, the body requireth some rest or refreshment, when the active
   power is weakened, and the vital spirits and principles of motion are
   dulled; but in fainting, the vital power is contracted, and retireth,
   and leaveth the outward parts lifeless and senseless. When a man is
   wearied, his strength is abated; when he fainteth, he is quite spent.
   These things, by a metaphor, are applied to the soul or mind. A man is
   weary when the fortitude of his mind, his moral or spiritual strength,
   is broken or begins to abate, when his soul sits uneasy under
   sufferings; but when he sinketh under the burden of grievous, tedious,
   or long affliction, then he is said to faint; when all the reasons and
   grounds of his comfort are quite spent, and he can hold out no longer.

   2. The causes of fainting. The fainting of the body may arise either
   from labour, sickness and travel, or else from hunger and thirst. So
   the fainting of the soul is either, first, from the tediousness of
   present pressures; or, secondly, from a fervent and strong desire.

   [1.] From the tediousness of present sorrows and pressures; as Jer.
   viii. 18, When I would comfort myself against my sorrow, my heart
   fainteth within me.' And why? Because of the length of their
   afflictions, ver. 20, The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we
   are not saved.' Sorrow doth so invade their spirits, that they are by
   no means able to ease themselves: expectations of this side, and that
   side, are cut off; they long look for help and relief, but none
   appeareth. So Lam. i. 22, My sighs are many, and my heart is faint.'
   They are overwhelmed with grief, and cannot bear up with any courage.

   [2.] It may be caused by a fervent and strong desire: Ps. lxxxiv. 2, My
   soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of God.' Vehement
   desires cause a languor. So it is taken here: It is long, O Lord, that
   I have waited and attended with great desire for deliverance from thee.
   Those who vehemently desire anything are apt to faint. Where love is
   hot, desire cannot be cold. The benefit of the church, liberty to serve
   God, do strongly move the saints; yea, the Spirit of God increaseth the
   vehemency of these motions; For he maketh intercession for the saints
   with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered,' Rom. viii. 20. He
   concurreth to the vehemency of the desire; but the fainting is from
   ourselves, from our weakness. The soul is so earnestly fixed in the
   expectation of God's salvation that it can no longer keep any equal
   tenour; so that this fainting is one of the love-errors of the children
   of God, like a disease which is incident only to the best tempers.

   3. The kinds of fainting. (1.) There is a fainting which causeth great
   trouble and dejection of spirit. (2.) There is a fainting which causeth
   apostasy and defection from God and the cause of religion.

   [1.] There is a fainting which causeth dejection and trouble; this is
   spoken of Heb. xii. 5, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the
   Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him.' There are the two
   extremes, slighting and fainting. Now this is a fault in the children
   of God, to be much perplexed in their troubles; but yet this may be
   incident to them, religion heightening their sense of evils, and their
   vehement desires of the comforts of God's presence increasing their
   trouble.

   [2.] There is a fainting which causeth defection and falling off from
   God, out of cowardice and carnal fear, and casting off the profession
   of Christianity when they find it troublesome; they grow weary, incline
   to apostasy: this is not incident to the children of God: Rev. ii. 3,
   Thou hast borne, and hast patience, and hast laboured, and hast not
   fainted,' not given over the cause of God. There is a fainting which is
   a slacking or remitting somewhat in our spiritual course, when men
   begin a little to relent, and to give way to coldness and lukewarmness,
   and do not keep up their former zeal and fervency or diligence in
   heavenly things. This may befall sometimes the servants of God, abate
   somewhat of their former forwardness, Eph. iii. 13, when either they
   suffer themselves, or those who are primarily instrumental in the work
   of the gospel are cast into a suffering condition. And there is a
   fainting which makes totally and finally to abandon the ways of God:
   Gal. vi. 9, He shall reap in due time, if he faint not' There it is not
   taken for some remissness, which may befall the best of God's servants,
   but a total defection.

   4. The considerations which may preserve us from fainting.

   [1.] It argueth that you are lazy, love the ease of the flesh, have
   small strength, if you faint upon every appearance of difficulty and
   trouble: Prov. xxiv. 10, If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy
   strength is small.' Sinners are not discouraged with every
   inconvenience occasioned by their sin, but can deny themselves for
   their lusts' sake; and shall we be soon discouraged in God's service?

   [2.] Others that have borne far heavier burthens, do not sink under
   them. The Lord Christ: Heb. xii. 3, For consider him, who endured such
   contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied, and faint
   in your minds.' Nay, many of his precious servants: Heb. xii. 4, Ye
   have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.' If against
   sin, are we only to praise their courage, never show our own? or do we
   think to go to heaven without conflicts, when it doth cost them so
   dear?

   [3.] We have given counsel to others: Job iv. 5, But now it is come
   upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.'
   It is an easier matter to instruct others than to carry it well
   ourselves. The well will give counsel to the sick, and those that stand
   on land direct those that are apt to sink in deep waters. But should
   not we remember these things ourselves?

   [4.] God promises to moderate the afflictions of his people, and to
   sweeten the bitterness of them, to take off the oppressing weight of
   their troubles, lest their souls faint: Isa. lvii. 16, For I will not
   contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit should
   fail before me, and the souls which I have made.' The consideration of
   man's infirmity and weakness, unable to hold out, causeth the Lord to
   stay his hand; he will not utterly dishearten and discourage his people
   that wait for him. A good man will not overburden his beast.

   [5.] When reason is tired, faith should supply its place, and we should
   hope against hope, Rom. iv. 18; for faith can fetch one contrary out of
   another, and get water out of the rock, as well as out of the fountain.
   When probable means miscarry, then it is a time for God to work; and
   faith should bear us out when sense and reason cannot.

   [6.] Give vent to the ardour of your desires in prayer: Luke xviii. 1,
   He spake a parable to them, to this end, that men ought always to pray,
   and not to faint:' and Jonah ii. 7, When my soul fainted within me, I
   remembered the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy
   temple.' Keep up the suit, it will come to a hearing one day; though it
   be long ere God ariseth to the judgment, yet then make sure work of it.

   [7.] By waiting upon God we learn to wait more: Isa. xl. 31, They that
   wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with
   wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk,
   and not faint.' Eternal blessings eyed and prepared for will support a
   fainting soul in the worst evil: 2 Cor. iv. 16, For this cause we faint
   not; though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day
   by day.' The greatest troubles cannot make void our hope, if our
   spiritual state increase and our eternal hopes thrive.

   Doct. 3. Though the soul be in a fainting condition, yet it will accept
   of nothing but God's salvation, Thy salvation:' Ps. xciv. 18, When I
   said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O Lord, held me up;' and ver. 19, In
   the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.'
   Men may seek to get out of their troubles from wicked men two
   ways--either by carnal compliance, or by the use of indirect means.

   [1.] By carnal compliance, when men violate and prostitute their
   consciences for their peace's sake. It is said of some, Heb. xi. 35,
   that They accepted not deliverance, that they might obtain a better
   resurrection.' They might upon certain conditions have been freed from
   those cruel pains and tortures, but those conditions were contrary to
   the law of God. We have God's deliverance upon better terms than man's,
   and it is better in itself

   [2.] By using indirect means to get off the trouble; this is making too
   much haste: Isa. xxviii. 16, He that believeth shall not make haste.'
   Ravishing the blessing, rather than waiting for the issues of God's
   providence. Those that do so, God will reckon them with the workers of
   iniquity: Ps. cxxv. 5, As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways,
   the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
   shall be upon Israel.' They that shift for themselves lose the benefit
   of God's protection. These are dealt with as open enemies. Now the
   reasons of the point are these:--

   1. Because they are satisfied in God's providential government. God
   never puts power in the hands of wicked men but for his own holy ends.
   Therefore, while God continueth them, they are observing what God will
   do by them: 2 Sam. xvi. 11, Let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden
   him.' God hath work for them to do, to mortify our wantonness, to break
   our stubborn humours.

   2. Because God's salvation will come in the best time and in the best
   way: Ps. lxii. 1, Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my
   salvation;' Isa. xxx. 18, God is a God of judgment: blessed are they
   that wait for him.' God doth all things with wisdom, and in the best
   manner.

   Use. How afflicted soever we be, let us not seek to be delivered in a
   way not allowed by God, nor take any sinister courses, nor use any base
   shifts to rid ourselves out of danger. This is to distrust God, and to
   entangle ourselves the more, and to miscarry in a long voyage, after we
   are about to enter into the port. See the story of Saul's sacrificing,
   in 1 Sam. xiii., from the 8th verse to the 15th. If he had tarried a
   little longer all had been well. Before the day was quite over, Saul
   would sacrifice, and then Samuel cometh and telleth him God had rent
   the kingdom from him for his distrust and disobedience. So many will
   forestall the blessing.

   Doct. 4. Hope keepeth us alive in the midst of faintings: My soul
   fainteth; but I hope.'

   1. Observe here, that though the faith of God's children seems to
   faint, yet it doth not die nor wholly fail. Some seem greedily to catch
   at promises at first, but their ardour is soon spent; and when it is a
   troublesome business to wait upon God, they give it over. This is the
   faith and hope of temporaries, but the good ground bringeth forth fruit
   with patience,' Luke viii. 15. God's children tarry his leisure; and
   though now and then they are ready to faint, yet they recover. Their
   faith, hope, and patience seemeth to be almost spent, yet it is not
   utterly put out; as David here was not broken with long and tedious
   difficulties; though he saw no end of his miseries, yet he would still
   depend upon God. There is an abiding seed, 1 John iii. 8. Their state
   is secured by God's covenant, that there shall be no total rupture nor
   utter deficiency. Perseverance is a condition of the new covenant, not
   only required, but given, as all conditions of the new covenant are.
   There is donum perseverantiae, not only a power to persevere, but
   perseverance itself.

   2. That which keepeth our faith from dying, and sustaineth the soul of
   the faithful, and keepeth life in them, is the resuscitation of our
   hopes. What doth hope to the supporting of a fainting soul?

   [1.] It draweth off the mind from things present to things future; and
   diversion is one way to cure trouble. While we pore only on our
   grievous troubles, they prove a temptation to us; but hope lifts up the
   head, and looketh above these things. That poring on the affliction and
   trouble causes fainting; see Lam. iii. 18-20; but remembering God's
   mercies and promises reviveth us. The remembering the great depth of
   affliction and extremity overwhelmeth us: I have them in mind
   continually, and so am dejected; but when I begin to call to mind God's
   infinite mercies, I conceive some hope of recovery. That which was
   remembered is in ver. 22-26.

   [2.] Hope representeth the excellency and certainty of these future
   things, and so causeth earnestness and patience.

   (1.) The excellency. It is a question among divines what is the
   difference between faith and hope, because they are much of a like
   nature. One difference is, faith looks to the truth of the promise,
   hope to the goodness of the thing promised; for faith respects the
   person giving his fidelity, and hope the person receiving the benefit,
   and exciteth them to look for it. It is something worth the looking and
   waiting for, and such as will recompense present troubles, 2 Cor. v.
   17, 18.

   (2.) The certainty; for though it mainly comforts itself with the
   goodness of the thing promised, yet it causeth patience in waiting,
   because of the sureness. It seeth things that cannot be seen and
   perceived by sense: Rom. viii. 25, If we hope for that which we see
   not, then do we with patience wait for it.' It is good, and it will not
   fail; therefore we may and must tarry God's leisure.

   (3.) The most noble and principal object of -hope is the great promise
   of eternal salvation. This must in chief be hoped for; partly because
   temporal salvation is not so surely promised, but under sundry cautions
   and reservations; as if it be for our good, if God's glory will permit
   it, and the beauty of his work, and the many things God hath to do
   before the deliverance be brought about; especially if it be a common
   salvation, wherein others are concerned as well as we; as if their
   hearts be prepared, &c. Partly because Christians are to be at a point
   of greater indifferency about outward things than the believers of the
   Old Testament, now life and immortality is brought to light, 2 Tim. i.
   10. They were trained up by sensible things both in their worship and
   promises. The cross is one of our conditions: Mat. xvi. 24, If any man
   will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
   follow me.' We must look for afflictions, and those not ordinary
   afflictions, but the loss of all, or else we do not count the charges
   aright; we must refer all to God's will. Christ may let some slip
   through at a cheaper and easier rate, but all must resolve on it.
   Partly because this is propounded as the great comfort, Luke xii. 32,
   Fear not, little flock; it is your Father's good pleasure to give you
   the kingdom:' and accordingly used by the saints. David in his
   disappointments: Ps. xxxix. 7, And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope
   is in thee.' He meaneth the hope of immortality, opposite to that vain
   show and false appearance which is in worldly things. This was that Job
   comforted himself with, that ancient believer: Job xix. 26, Though
   after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
   God:' and the Maccabees, Heb. xi. 35, They were tortured, not accepting
   deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.' Partly
   because that which God hath promised in the world to come is only
   satisfactory, and able to quiet a man's mind, and make him patiently
   wait upon God in all his troubles. Here is enough to countervail all
   difficulties, to support us under them, to recompense us for them; it
   is not long ere it will come to hand, it cannot enough be desired; it
   may be hoped for by the righteous in their greatest extremities: Prov.
   xiv. 32, The righteous hath hope in his death.'

   Use. For instruction. When your souls are apt to faint, let hope look
   out for better times or better things.

   1. For better times. God will not always chide: Ps. ciii. 9, He will
   not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever.' Nor shall
   the rod of the wicked always rest on the back of the righteous, Ps.
   cxxv. 3. Therefore rouse up yourselves, and say, as David, Ps. xlii. 5,
   Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me?
   Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him,' &c. Let us not always
   pore on our grievous miseries. Observe the season, when apt to be
   corrupted with ease and prosperity, and to carry it negligently to God,
   and proudly and oppressingly to men. There may come a change. So when
   apt to faint, seek out arguments of encouragement, and hope that God
   will be good to us: Ps. lvi. 3, At what tune I am afraid, I will trust
   in thee.' That is our business at such a time, to strengthen our
   dependence, for still we must oppose the prevailing corruption.

   2. Better things. That is the true Christian spirit that mainly looks
   after the world to come; that hope is freest from snares. An earthly
   hope maketh men carnal, often enticeth them to use ill means to get it
   accomplished. Desires and hopes of temporal happiness, that the world
   may smile upon us, doth not breed so good a spirit. This hope goeth
   upon* surer grounds, meeteth with fewer disappointments.

   Well, then, hope for these things. We shall hear of few in whom the
   former part of the text is verified, if understood of eternal
   salvation, My soul fainteth for thy salvation.' This temper is very
   rare, and few have such a spirit as Paul had: Phil. i. 23, I desire to
   be dissolved, and to be with Christ,' &c. But all Christians should
   hope for eternal life, and prepare for it, and make this the great
   cordial and solace of their souls. God's people do too much please
   themselves with thoughts of temporal happiness; this is no good spirit.
   The ap petite of temporal honour, wealth and peace, is natural to us;
   we should be at a greater indifferency about these things, so as not to
   be very solicitous about them.

   Doct. 5. This hope is bred or nourished in us by the word of God.

   1. Because that is the law of commerce between us and God. In the
   promissory part it showeth what salvation and deliverance we may expect
   from him; and in the mandatory part, upon what terms, and who are the
   persons qualified to receive this deliverance: and without heeding of
   these things, hope is a groundless presumption, as if we expect things
   not promised, or not in the way wherein they are promised. We must have
   an eye both on the promises and the precepts--the one to encourage us,
   the other to direct us. It showeth our hope is of the right
   constitution; Ps. cxix. 166, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done
   thy commandments;' Ps. cxlvii. 11, The Lord taketh pleasure in them
   that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy;' and Ps. xxxiii. 18,
   Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that
   hope in his mercy:' as a man that consulteth with his charter and
   conveyance is more assured of his right and title. The scripture is
   cast into the nature of a covenant or mutual indenture drawn up between
   us and God. There we find God hath deeply and strongly engaged himself
   to us, and we to him. This we have to show under his hand.

   2. We should give such credit to the word of God as to believe it, when
   to sense there is no likelihood of the performance of it; for what is
   impossible to appearance, is not impossible to God, and the certainty
   of the promises doth not depend upon the probabilities of sense, but
   upon the all-sufficiency of God. Firmia [6] dicta tanti existimantur,
   quantus est ipse qui diceret. If God promise anything, who is almighty
   and who is faithful, it will be accomplished, and we may rest upon it
   in the greatest extremities, perplexities, and seeming impossibilities.
   We must not confine God within the bounds of created power.

   3. God's word should be as good as deed, for his word and the beck of
   his will doth all things: Do not my words do good to him that walketh
   uprightly?' Micah ii. 7. Not say good, but do good; when it is said, it
   may be accounted done, the performance is so certain.

   4. The best holdfast we can have upon God is by his word. What ever his
   dispensations be, though he withhold comfort and deliverance from us.
   yet it will do well in time. Therefore, whether he smileth or frowneth,
   his word should be our support. His dispensations vary, but his word is
   firm.

   Use. Let the promises of God strengthen and revive our hearts.

   If God hath said anything, his people should believe him. His word is a
   word of truth, Heb. xi. 11. Sarah's faith was built upon this; She
   judged him faithful who had promised.' His word is a word of power, for
   he is a God of all power and might: Heb. xi. 17-19. So Abraham's faith:
   By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had
   received the promises offered up his only-begotten son, of whom it was
   said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called; accounting that God was
   able to raise him up, even from the dead.' His power, as is his being,
   is infinite. Therefore, having his word, this should give us rest and
   contentment of soul, though there be no appearance of performance; the
   promise is yea and amen, and continueth in one invariable tenour. Let
   not faith die.

SERMON XC.

   Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me.--Ver.
   82.

   IN this verse the man of God expresseth--(1.) His earnest expectation
   of the comfort of the promises; (2.) His longing desire after it; as
   hope is wont to vent itself by serious thoughts, intermixed with strong
   desires of the blessing promised. His earnest expectation is expressed
   in the first clause, mine eyes fail for thy word. His longing and
   strong desire in the following words, saying, When wilt thou comfort
   me?

   His earnest hope and expectation is first to be considered; and here
   his hope is described

   1. By the effect, his looking after the accomplishment of the promise;
   as, Judges v. 28, when Sisera's mother expected him, She looked out at
   a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in
   coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?' and Rom. viii. 19, The
   earnest expectation of the creature waiteth,' &c.--apokaradoki'a tes
   kti'seos, the lifting up or stretching out of the head, as we use to do
   when we look for anything, to see if we can spy it coming.

   2. By the incident weakness, because of the delay of help, Mine eyes
   fail for thy word.' He had looked and looked long, till he was weary of
   looking; what he said before of the soul, here he speaketh of his eyes.
   There the object was salvation, here the word.

   Observe, first, that hope keepeth the eye of the soul so fixed upon the
   promise, that it is ever looking for deliverance and salvation.
   Hezekiah useth almost, the same manner of speech, Isa. xxxviii. 14,
   Mine eyes fail with looking upward,' that is, to God for ease and
   relief; as when we expect anybody's coming, we send our eyes towards
   the place from whence he cometh. Reasons:--

   1. The children of God make more of a promise than others do, and that
   upon a double account--partly because they value the blessing promised,
   partly because they are satisfied by the assurance given by God's word;
   so that whereas others pass by these things with a careless eye, their
   souls are lifted up to the constant and earnest expectation of the
   blessing promised. It is said of the hireling, that he must have his
   wages before the sun go down, Deut. xxiv. 15, Because he is poor, and
   hath set his heart upon it:' or, as it is in the Hebrew, lifted up his
   soul to it,' meaning thereby both his desire and hope. He esteemeth his
   wage for it is the solace of his labours, and the maintenance of his
   life; and he assuredly expecteth it, upon the promise and covenant of
   him who setteth him awork. So it is with the children of God; they
   esteem the blessings promised, and God's word giveth them good
   assurance that they do not wait upon him in vain: 1 Tim. iv. 10,
   Therefore we both labour, and suffer reproach, because we trust in the
   living God, who is the saviour of all men, especially of those that
   believe.' They know God is good to all, much more to his covenant
   servants. They value his salvation, and venture their all upon his
   salvation and the truth of his word; and therefore lift up their souls
   to him in the midst of their pressures and difficulties.

   2. It is some satisfaction to enjoy the blessing in idea and
   contemplation, before we have it indeed. Hope causeth a kind of
   anticipation and pre-union of our souls with the blessedness expected:
   as heirs live upon their lands before they have them. And that is the
   reason why joy is made to be the fruit of hope, though it be proper to
   fruition and enjoyment: Rom. xii. 12, Rejoicing in hope of the glory of
   God.' It refresheth them in their pilgrimage, and affecteth them in
   some measure as if it were in hand. So Rom. xv. 13, The God of hope
   fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in
   hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.' While believing, waiting,
   hoping, while conflicting with difficulties, the; carry themselves as
   if they had already obtained the thing promised; for by eying the
   promise they are cheered and revived. Hope giveth a foretaste,
   especially when the comforting Spirit addeth his impression thereunto.

   3. The opening of the eye of faith argueth a closing of tie eye of
   sense, which giveth a double benefit--(1.) That we are not withdrawn by
   vain objects; (2.) Not discouraged with contrary appearances.

   [1.] That we are not withdrawn by vain objects. Nothing doth quench
   zeal and holiness and joy in the Lord, nor cast water upon that sacred
   fire which should be kindled and kept ever burning in our bosoms, so
   much as keeping the eye of sense always open to behold the lustre and
   beauty of worldly vanities. Alas! then hope of heaven and salvation
   from God is a cold heartless thing; we think of it carelessly, desire
   and press after it very weakly. But now, when the eye of sense is shut,
   and the eye of faith kept always open, then hope advanceth itself with
   life and vigour, and present things seem less, and things to come
   greater and more glorious in our eyes: 1 Peter i. 13, Be sober, and
   hope to the end,' &c. Sobriety is the moderation of our affections in
   the pursuit and use of earthly things. The delights of the present life
   burden the soul, glue it to the earth, and to base and inferior
   objects; but when our souls are kept in the fresh, lively, and serious
   expectation of better things, all the things of the world appear more
   contemptible. It is not for eagles to catch flies, nor for the heirs of
   promise to be captivated by the delights of sense; so that every day
   our hope is more certain and powerful, our pursuit more earnest. The
   mind is not darkened with the fumes of lust, nor diverted from those
   noble objects.

   [2.] The eye of sense being shut, we are not discouraged with contrary
   appearances, nor with fears and troubles ad the trials of the present
   life, because hope seeth sunshine behind the back of the storm. We have
   a notable emblem of the eye of faith an the eye of sense in the prophet
   and the prophet's man: 2 Kings vi. 15-17, When the servant of the man
   of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the
   city, both with horses and chariots: and his servant said to him, Alas,
   my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not; for they that be
   with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and
   said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord
   opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain
   was full of horses and chariots of fire round about.' Elisha's man is
   affrighted with the dreadful appearance of enemies encompassing them
   round about, and is at his wit's end. What shall we do?' But his master
   Elisha had the eye of faith, and could see great preparations which God
   had sent for their defence, which the servant could not see; therefore
   encourageth him, and in a prophetical vision showeth not only more
   horses and chariots, but chariots of fire, which were no other than the
   angels of God come together in the manner of a host, to rescue the
   prophet of God. What was represented to him in a prophetical vision is
   always evident to faith and to the eyes of a believing soul; they see
   God and his holy angels set for their deliverance. When God openeth the
   eyes of the mind, they can see the glory and power of the other world;
   and then, though troubled on every side, yet not distressed; though
   perplexed, yet not in despair; though persecuted, yet not forsaken;
   though cast down, yet not destroyed,' 2 Cor. iv. 8, 9, though wrestling
   with difficulties, yea, brought to some extremities, yet this invisible
   assistance supporteth them; and though they have little human means,
   yet God carrieth them on to their expected end and issue.

   Use 1. To reprove us for poring so much upon present things, and
   neglecting those to come, especially the great recompense of reward.
   Alas! men have either none, or cold thoughts of that blessed estate
   which is offered in the promises. Our thoughts fly up and down like
   dust in the wind; they may sometimes light upon good things, but they
   vanish, and abide not. We may have some cold ineffectual glances upon
   heaven and heavenly things, which fly away, and never leave the soul
   better. This argueth hope is very weak, if there be any at all; for
   hope is always longing and looking out for the blessing, sending spies
   into the land of promise, to bring it tidings thence; it will discover
   itself not by glances and wishes; for the worst men may have some of
   these in their good mood and sober thoughts; but by frequent, deep, and
   ponderous meditations: you do not eye the mark, Phil. iii. 14, nor mind
   your scope and great end, 2 Cor. iv. 18. Certainly that which must be
   intended in every righteous action, either formally or virtually--that
   is, by some noted explicit thought, or by the unobserved act of some
   potent habit--should be oftener thought of and longed for; you do not
   live by faith else. For what is living by faith, but with drawing the
   mind from present things to things to come, looking beyond and above
   the world to eternity? 2 Cor. v. 7; Heb. xi. 11. You are not acquainted
   with the influence of the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, for he
   openeth the eyes of the mind. Why? That you may look above the mists
   and clouds of the lower world to those good things which we are to
   enjoy in heaven, Eph. i. 17, 18, and 1 Cor. ii. 12. Alas! we are taken
   up with trifles and childish toys, have our thoughts little exercised
   about these nobler objects. Therefore is it that our diligence is so
   little; for if they were oftener minded, they would be more diligently
   sought after: Phil. iii. 14, I press towards the mark for the prize of
   the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' Therefore is our patience so
   little; for the bitterness of the cross would be more sweetened if our
   minds and meditations were oftener set about heaven and heavenly
   things, Rom. viii. 18. Therefore are our conversations so worldly,
   Phil. iii. 19, our desires and longings so cold and weak, so little
   mind to get home, Phil. i. 23, pollo mallon kreisson.

   Use 2. To press us to eye the promised blessedness more than we do. The
   promise is our warrant, and the thing promised is the comfort, solace,
   and support of our souls. The promise must be laid up in the heart with
   a firm strong assent, and the thing promised ever kept in view. I shall
   give you the qualifications of this expectation.

   1. It must be a serious and earnest expectation: Phil. i. 20, According
   to my earnest expectation, that in nothing I shall be ashamed.' Earnest
   expectation is that which exciteth the heart to be ever looking and
   longing for the things promised. Our eyes are always looking to heaven,
   which is the seat and solace of our happiness. David describeth his
   earnestness notably: Ps. cxxx. 5, 6, I wait for the Lord; my soul doth
   wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than
   they that watch for the morning; I say, more than they that watch for
   the morning.' The priests, that officiated in their turns, never missed
   the performance of their daily offices there. So David was still
   awakening his desires, continuing his daily attendance on God, and
   renewing his longings and hopes.

   2. It is a lively expectation: 1 Peter i. 3, Begotten again unto a
   lively hope.' It is called lively from the effect, such as will put
   life into us in our damps of spirit and greatest discouragements,
   quickeneth us to hasten home apace, being animated by some cheerful
   foretastes of what we expect.

   3. It is a constant and unconquerable expectation, not broken with
   present difficulties, but sustaineth the soul, till our full and final
   deliverance cometh in hand: Ps. cxxiii. 2, As the eyes of servants look
   unto the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a maiden unto the
   hands of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the Lord our God, until he
   have mercy on us.' They never give over waiting and looking till God
   show mercy: 1 Peter i. 13, Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be
   sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto
   you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;' and Heb. vi. 11, And we desire
   that every one of you do show the same diligence, to the full assurance
   of hope unto the end.'

   4. It is a sure and certain hope, as being built on God's truth and
   faithfulness: it is compared to an anchor sure and steadfast,' Heb. vi.
   18. Why? Because of God's word and oath. God is the supreme verity, who
   can neither deceive or be deceived; therefore we should rest satisfied
   with his promise. To a promise, that it be certain and firm, three
   things are required,--that it be made seriously and heartily, with a
   purpose to perform it; that he that promiseth continue in this purpose,
   without change of mind; that it be in the power of him that promised to
   perform what is promised. Now of all these things there can be no
   doubt, if we believe the scriptures to be the word of God.

   [1.] Certainly God meaneth as he speaketh when he promiseth to give
   eternal life to the faithful servants and disciples of Jesus Christ.
   There is no question but that he is so minded, when he who is truth
   itself hath told the world of this; for what needed God to court the
   creature, or tell them of a happiness which he never meant to bestow
   upon them? If an honest man hath promised anything in his power, we
   look he should be as good as his word. Yea, we have his oath, which is
   pe'ras antilogi'as, and megi'ste para` anthro'pois pi'stis. He sent his
   Son with a commission from heaven to assure us; he is, Amen, the
   faithful witness,' Rev. iii. 14. He wrought miracles to confirm his
   message, died, rose again, and revived: 1 Peter i. 21, Who by him do
   believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory,
   that your faith and hope might be in God.' This message afterwards was
   confirmed by all kinds of signs and wonders, wrought by them who went
   abroad in his name to assure the world of this. Not to believe God is
   serious, is to make him a liar.

   [2.] That God doth continue his purpose, there can be no doubt in them
   who consider his unchangeable nature; he may change his dispensation,
   but not his purposed will: James i. 17, Every good gift and every
   perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,
   with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning;' Mal. iii. 6,
   I am the Lord, I change not; therefore the sons of Jacob are not
   consumed.'

   [3.] That he is able to perform it, since he can do what he will: Rom.
   iv. 21, And being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also
   able to perform.' So Phil. iii. 21, According to the working whereby he
   is able even to subdue all things to himself.' The most difficult thing
   in our hope is the raising of our bodies after being eaten by worms and
   turned to dust. It is a thing incredible, and to flesh and blood wholly
   impossible; but nothing is impossible to God. It is within the reach
   and compass of divine omnipotency. Well, then, the thing is sure in
   itself; let us labour and suffer reproach, wait with patience, renounce
   the desires and delights of the flesh, and with patience continue in
   well-doing, and then we may lift up our souls to it. Our reward is
   sure.

   The second point is from the incident weakness, because of the delay of
   help: Mine eyes fail for thy word.' He had his eyes fixed upon the
   promise till they were quite wearied.

   Doct. 2. Though his people wait for him, yet God may so long delay and
   suspend the performance of the promises till they count it a hopeless
   business.

   First, Suspend. The reasons are these:--

   1. Not because he is unwilling to give, but because he will have us
   better prepared to receive: Ps. x. 17, Thou wilt prepare their heart,
   thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.' We understand it usually of
   preparing the heart for prayer, to ask the mercy; but it is also meant
   of preparing the heart to receive the mercy: 2 Chron. xx. 33, The high
   places were not taken away, because the people had not yet prepared
   their heart to the God of their fathers;' they were not fit to have a
   thorough reformation accomplished in their days. The baker watcheth
   when the oven is hot, and then puts in the bread. At another time it
   went on roundly, for God had prepared the people, 2 Chron. xxix. 36.
   When we are in a posture, mercy will not be long a-coming. Heaven, the
   great mercy, is not given us till prepared; as heaven is prepared for
   us, so we for it: Rom. ix. 23, That he might make known the riches of
   his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto
   glory;' and Col. i. 12, Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made
   us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.' So
   other mercies; our unpreparedness lieth as a block in the way, and
   hindereth the free passage of God's mercy to us, till he send his work
   before him, &c.; Isa. xl. 10, Behold, the Lord God will come with
   strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with
   him, and his work before him.'

   2. To awaken fervency of prayer, and that the blessing may be the more
   earnestly sought after and highly valued. A thing easily come by doth
   not stir up such a desire after it. To` e'toimon eis exousi'an argo`n
   eis epithumi'an. We despise easy-gotten favours, but that which is long
   and earnestly sought is dearer to us. Therefore the Lord, to commend
   his favours to us, and to set a price upon them, will have us pray much
   and long: 1 Sam. i. 27, For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath
   given me the petition which I asked of him.'

   3. God doth it to prove and exercise our faith. Many of his servants
   have gone to the grave and his promises not yet accomplished, and yet
   have gone to the grave in hope: Heb. xi. 13, These all died in faith,
   not having received the promises' (that is, things promised), but
   having seen them afar off, were persuaded of them, and embraced them.'
   Then is faith tried when we can wait for the fulfilling of the
   promises: when we have no present enjoyment, and know not when we shall
   have, yea, likely never to see it in our days. The patriarchs lived and
   died believers; delay and non-enjoyment did not break their hearts, nor
   could death itself extinguish their faith. Death might bereave them of
   their friends, and their temporal estate, and all their earthly
   comforts, but of faith it could not.

   4. That patience may have its perfect work. It is marvellous patience
   that can yet wait for the word, when it will yield us the expected
   comfort, though our eyes fail in waiting. Then is the greatest
   discovery of its perfection, when difficulties are many, hope long
   delayed. It hath but a part of its work before, to still the mind under
   lesser or shorter evils. The perfection of a thing is never discovered
   till it be put to a full trial. Patience is seen in waiting as well as
   suffering. To bear a little while is but the imperfect work of
   patience, some lesser degree of it; as to know a letter or two in the
   book is but an imperfect kind of reading; but to bear much and long,
   that is the perfect work. To lift up some heavy thing from the ground,
   argueth some strength; but to carry it for an hour, or all day, is a
   more perfect thing.

   5. God delayeth the accomplishment of his promises, because many times
   the frame of his providence requireth it. All God's works have their
   appointed hour and time, and God will not disturb the order of causes,
   or work sooner or later; but as the beautiful frame of his providence
   doth permit: John ii. 4, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour
   is not yet come.' Our time wherein we would have him work, and his time
   wherein he will work, are often very different: for he will not
   manifest his help when it will please us best, but when his glory in
   working may be best seen: John vii. 6, My time is not yet come, but
   your time is always ready.'

   Secondly, The other branch is, that God may delay so long till they be
   disheartened, and give it over as a hopeless business. David saith his
   eyes failed for the word. When a man is disappointed of the things he
   looketh for, then his eyes are said to fail. So the captive Jews
   complained, Lam. iv. 17, As for us, our eyes have yet failed for our
   vain help: in our watching, we have waited for a nation that could not
   save us.'

   1. God may delay so long, till his enemies wax high and proud, as if
   above the reach of all evil, and God had forgotten them, or approved
   their ways: Ps. l. 21, I keep silence, and thou thoughtest I was
   altogether like thyself.' So long till all their fears are over: Job
   xxi. 9, Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon
   them.' And their oppressions are multiplied: Ps. x. 5, 6, His ways are
   always grievous, for he hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved.'

   2. God may delay so long, till a land be wasted by sundry successive
   common judgments that light upon good and bad, Jer. xii. 4. After the
   complaint of the prosperity of the wicked, the prophet subjoineth, How
   long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the field wither?' When
   they relent not, the land may fare the worse for them; and the godly,
   among the rest, suffer in these general calamities. God may plague the
   nation with dearth and famine, plague and pestilence, war and sword,
   fire and burning; and all this while no ceasing of their iniquities or
   oppressions.

   3. God may delay so long till his people be strangely perplexed, and
   know not what to make of his providence. They wonder how his justice
   can endure it: Jer. xii. 1, Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead
   with thee; yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments; where fore doth
   the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal
   very treacherously?' Hab. i. 12, 13, Art thou not from ever lasting, O
   Lord my God, mine holy one? We shall not die. O Lord, thou hast
   ordained them for judgment, and O mighty God, thou hast established
   them for correction. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and
   canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
   treacherously, and boldest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man
   that is more righteous than he?' They cannot reconcile his attributes
   and providences. We that are short-sighted, and short-spirited
   creatures, see not God's reasons; yea, God may delay so long, till
   their hearts faint, and their eyes fail, as in these two verses; till
   their faith and patience be quite spent, and they have left looking for
   it: Luke xviii. 8, Shall he find faith on the earth?' God loveth to
   show his people their infirmity, and to weaken all their courage,
   before he will do anything for them.

   4. God may delay so long in some cases, that there is no hope that God
   will do anything for them in this life; but all reasons for patience
   are only taken from the general judgment: James v. 7, 8, Be patient
   therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord; and stablish your
   hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.' They are put off till
   then, till the general harvest and restitution of all things; and in
   the mean time they must be content to sow in tears, that they may reap
   the fruit of their labours and sufferings at that time, and have their
   cause judged at his tribunal. He useth the similitude of an husbandman:
   Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and
   hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.'
   In some cases there may be no hope of our release till then, as the
   husbandman hath no profit by his seed until the harvest.

   Secondly, I shall speak of this failing of the eyes.

   1. Certainly the failing of the eyes is a fault, because it argueth the
   limiting of God, which is a great sin: Ps. lxxviii. 41, They limited
   -the holy one of Israel.' They limit God to times, means, instruments,
   present likelihood, and when these fail, their hearts fail. God cannot
   endure that his people, who ought wholly to depend upon him, and submit
   to him, should prescribe to him how or when he should help, as if they
   had a power of God, or could set bounds to his wisdom, mercy,
   omnipotency: all which are, as if he could do no more than what they
   conceive probable, or should act when they conceive fitting; and if he
   doth not then, that he never will, or can do it. They prescribe to his
   wisdom, control his power, question his love and truth.

   2. As it is a fault, so it is a punishment. Though David here saith,
   Mine eyes fail with waiting,' for that salvation and mercy which thou
   hast promised in the word, yet it is the usual judgment of the wicked,
   one of the curses of the law. It is said, Deut. xxviii. 32, Thy sons
   and daughters shall be given to another people, and thine eyes shall
   fail, in looking and longing for them all the day long.' They should
   look and long for some help, for the rescuing of their children, even
   till their eyes did fail in waiting, but all in vain: so Job xi. 20,
   The eyes of the wicked shall fail them, they shall not escape, but
   their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.' They may look for
   good, but never get the sight of it. Again, Deut. xxviii. 65, The Lord
   shall give thee trembling of heart and failing of eyes.' But though
   failing of eyes be a curse of the law, yet Christ became a curse for
   us. It is said in his name, Ps. lxix. 3 (for that psalm belongeth to
   Christ), Mine eyes fail in waiting for my God.' And so it is altered to
   us; it is a correction to humble us, and fit us for better -things.

   3. Though it be a sin and punishment, yet the fault is not in God's
   delay, but in the weakness and faintness of our hope. There was a fault
   in our first resolution for faith and patience. The children of God
   usually set to themselves a shorter period than the Lord doth. And so
   God is not slack, but we are hasty: 2 Peter iii. 9, The Lord is not
   slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is
   long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance.' And there is a weakness in the exercise
   of our faith and patience. They that look long for good, and the
   succour of his promises, the delay is troublesome to them. Hope
   deferred maketh the heart sick,' Prov. xiii. 12. Hope belongeth to
   love; and the affections of pursuit and love maketh absence tedious
   when afflicted in the interim; but faith and dependence upon God should
   keep us waiting, and patience should enable us to tarry his leisure:
   Jonah ii. 4, I said, I am cast out of thy sight, yet I will look again
   toward the holy temple.' There is our fault, that we give over hope and
   calling upon God, and depending on him, and holding fast on his
   covenant and promise, which we should not do. When God seemeth to turn
   his back on the saints, yet they will not forsake him.

   4. The hopes of God's children fail them long, though not for ever. He
   many times bringeth his children to a low ebb, and doth for a long time
   withhold his aid, yet he doth not altogether forsake them: Isa. liv. 7,
   8, For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will
   I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment,
   but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord
   thy redeemer.'

   Use. Well, then, let us not be over-troubled at the delay of the
   promised and expected blessings.

   1. We are hasty for mercy, slow to duty: Ps. cii. 2, When I call,
   answer me speedily.' We cry, How long? But how justly may God cry, How
   long? We complain of the delay of the promise; God may more justly
   complain of the delay of our obedience. How long do we make God stay
   and wait till our leisure come? Jer. iv. 14, O Jerusalem, wash thine
   heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy
   vain thoughts lodge within thee?' and Jer. xiii. 27, O Jerusalem, wilt
   thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?' To-day, now is the time
   we set God for mercy, to-morrow for duty. God must tarry our sinful
   leisure, and we will not tarry his holy leisure. God is our sovereign,
   we are debtors to him. Ours is a debt, his a free gift. If God had been
   as quick with you as you with him, where had you been?

   2. It argueth weakness; a short walk is a long journey to the weak and
   sickly. It is the impatience of our flesh and the weakness of our
   faith. We would make short work for faith and patience, but God seeth
   then our graces would not be found to any praise and honour. God is the
   best judge of opportunities, therefore all must be left to his will and
   pleasure. Faith will not count it long; for to the eye of faith things
   future and afar off are as present: Heb. xi. 1, Faith is the substance
   of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.' It is said, Isa.
   xxviii. 16, He that believeth shall not make haste.' Sense and carnal
   confidence must have present satisfaction, but faith contents itself
   with promises. Love will not count it long; for seven years to Jacob
   seemed as a few days, Gen. xxix. 20. Sufferings for Christ would not be
   so tedious, where love prevaileth. Patience would not count it long.
   Cannot we tarry for him a little while? Heb. x. 37, Yet a little while,
   and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry,' e'ti ga`r
   mi'kron o'son o'son. We love our own ease, and therefore the cross
   groweth irksome and tedious.

   3. God is a God of judgment: Isa. xxx. 18, And therefore will the Lord
   wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be
   exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the Lord is a God of
   judgment; blessed are all they that wait for him.' Mercy will not come
   one jot too soon nor one jot too late; in the fittest time for God to
   give and us to receive: Heb. iv. 16, eu'kairon boe'theian, In the time
   of need.' We think we stay for God, but he stayeth for us. If we were
   ripe for mercy, God is always ready, for he is a present help: Ps.
   xlvi. 1, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
   trouble.'

   I come now to the second clause, his longing desire after it, saying,
   When wilt thou comfort me? that is, David was ever and anon repeating
   and saying, Lord, when?' The Hebrews express their wishes by way of
   question: Oh, that thou wouldest comfort me!

   Doct. 3. When our hope and help is delayed, we may complain to God for
   want of comfort.

   1. What is the comfort which David intendeth? In the general,
   consolation is opposed to grief and mourning. Sin hath woven calamities
   into our lives, and filled us with. griefs, troubles, and sorrows, so
   that we need comfort. Comfort is either eternal, spiritual, or
   temporal.

   [1.] Eternal: 2 Thes. ii. 16, Everlasting consolation and good hope
   through grace:' Luke xvi. 25, Remember that thou in thy life time
   receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus evil things; but now he is
   comforted, and thou art tormented.'

   [2.] Spiritual, which is of two sorts:--

   (1.) Comfort against the trouble of sin; in which respect the Holy
   Ghost is called the Comforter. In this respect the Holy Ghost biddeth
   them comfort the penitent incestuous person, 2 Cor. ii. 7.

   (2.) Against affliction: so God is said to comfort those that are cast
   down,' 2 Cor. vii. 6; and Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my thoughts
   within me thy comforts delight my soul:' 2 Cor. i. 3, 4, Blessed be
   God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,
   and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation,
   that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the
   comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.'

   [3.] Temporal; so God is said to comfort those whom he freeth from
   afflictions: Ps. lxxi. 21, after deep and sore troubles, Thou shalt
   increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.' So the Lord
   comforteth his people, not by word only, but also by deed; not only by
   speaking comfort to them, but also by relieving them, and refreshing
   them, and freeing them from their troubles. So Isa. lii. 9, Sing, ye
   waste places, for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed
   Jerusalem.' Though God's people lay low for a time, yet his blessing
   can exalt them beyond all expectation, and bring about such happiness
   as may make them forget their sorrows and miseries. This is intended
   here: Lord, when wilt thou give that deliverance which I pray for, and
   wait for at thy hands? Let it not seem strange that temporal
   deliverance should be owned as a comfort to God's people. Partly
   because they are acts of God's providence and dispensations of his
   grace, sought not [7] in a way of faith and prayer: Zech. i. 17, The
   Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.' Partly
   because by these he seemeth to own them, and confirm them in the
   privilege of his peculiar care, and that they have an interest in his
   favour; which by sad afflictions seemed to be an nulled and made void.
   But hereby God giveth proof of his favour to them: Ps. lxxxvi. 17, Show
   me a token for good, that they which hate me may see it, and be
   ashamed; because thou, Lord, hast holpeu me, and comforted me:' that in
   their affliction godliness may not suffer, nor wicked men be hardened
   in their insolency. Partly as hereby promises are made good, and so
   faith confirmed: Isa. lvii. 18, I will heal him, and restore comforts
   to him, and to his mourners.' Partly as they are helps and
   encouragements to love and praise God, and to live in a thankful course
   of holiness, when not stopped or diverted by fear of enemies: Isa. xii.
   1, In that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou
   wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst
   me.' We may serve God more cheerfully then. Partly because as they have
   seen his wisdom and justice in their troubles, so now his power and
   grace and truth in their deliverance. They are more comfortable,
   because there is much of God discovered in them, Ps. cxv. 1. Lastly,
   because they are comfortable to the natural life. They are not so
   divested of all human respects. Yet therein the saints moderate
   themselves; they do not count these things their highest consolation.
   So it is said of the wicked, Luke vi. 24, Woe unto you that are rich,
   for ye have received your consolation:' and Luke xvi. 25, Thou
   receivedst thy good things.' Yet a sense they have, otherwise how can
   we be humbled under crosses, or give thanks for blessings?

   2. We may complain of the delay of comfort. God's children have done
   so: Ps. vi. 3, But thou, O Lord, how long?' Ps. xiii. 1, How long wilt
   thou forget me, Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from
   me?' so ver. 2, How long shall mine enemies triumph over me?' Ps. xciv.
   3, 4, Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
   triumph? How long shall they utter, and speak hard things? and all the
   workers of iniquity boast themselves?' Reasons:--

   [1.] Partly because prayer giveth ease; it is a vent to strong
   affections.

   [2.] It reviveth the work of faith, hope, and patience.

   [3.] Though God knoweth when to bestow blessings, yet he will not blame
   the desires of his children after them.

   Use. Well, then, let us seek comfort, and complain not of God, but to
   God. Complaints of God give a vent to murmurings; but complaints to
   God, to faith, hope, and patience.

   1. Refer the kind of comfort to God, whether he will give temporal
   deliverance, a comfortable sense of his love, or hopes of glory, a
   clearer right and title to eternal rest.

   2. Yea, refer the thing itself. Comfort is necessary, because a great
   part of our temptations lie in troubles as well as allurements. Sense
   of pain may discompose us, as well as pleasure entice us. The world is
   a persecuting as well as a tempting world. The flesh troubleth as well
   as enticeth. The devil is a disquieting as well as an ensnaring devil.
   But yet comfort, though necessary, is not so necessary as holiness.
   Therefore, though comfort is not to be despised, yet sincere love to
   God is to be preferred; and though it be not dispensed so certainly, so
   constantly, and in so high a degree in this world, we must be
   contented. The Spirit's comforting work is oftener interrupted than the
   work of holiness; so much as is necessary to our employment for God in
   the world we shall have.

   3. Comfort is raised in us by the Spirit of God: Acts ix. 31, Then had
   the churches rest, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the
   Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.' For means
   we have his word, his promises, and also his providence. His word: Rom.
   xv. 4, Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our
   learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
   have hope.' His promises: Ps. cxix. 50, This is my comfort in my
   affliction: for thy word hath quickened me:' Heb. vi. 17, 18, Wherein
   God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us.' And also his providence, protection, and
   defence: Ps. xxiii. 4, Thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
   comfort me.' The rod and staff are spoken of as instruments of defence.

   4. Consider how ready God is to comfort his people: Isa. xl. 1 , 2,
   Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably
   to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that
   her iniquity is pardoned.' When time serveth, God sendeth these
   messages.

SERMON XCI.

   For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy
   precepts.--Ver. 83.

   HERE is rendered a reason why he doth so earnestly beg for comfort and
   deliverance. The reason is taken from his necessity, he was scarce able
   to bear any longer delay of comfort. Not only his faith and hope was
   spent, but his body was even spent through the trouble that was upon
   him. He had told us, in the 81st verse, My soul fainteth for thy
   salvation:' in the 82d verse, Mine eyes fail for thy word:' and now, I
   am become like a bottle in the smoke,' &c.

   Observe here--(1.) His condition represented; (2.) His resolution
   maintained. Or--

   First, The heat of tribulation, I am become like a bottle in the smoke.

   Secondly, His constant perseverance in his duty, Yet do I not forget
   thy precepts.

   1. His condition is represented by the similitude of a bottle in the
   smoke, alluding therein to a bottle of skin, such as the Jews used; as
   in Spain their wine is put into borachos, or bags made of hog-skins,
   a'sko en aigei'o; in Homer; in a vessel or bottle of goat-skin. And
   Christ's similitude of old bottles and new bottles relateth thereunto,
   Mat. ix. 17; for he meaneth it of skin-bottles or bladders, if such a
   bottle be hung up in the smoke, and by that means becometh black,
   parched, and dry. The man of God thought this a fit emblem of his
   condition. The Septuagint reads en pa'chne, in the frost.' Kitor
   signifieth any fume or vapour, whether of smoke or mist; as Ps.
   cxlviii. 8, Fire and hail, snow and vapour.' The word for vapour is the
   same with this which is here rendered smoke. Here it signifieth smoke
   rather than vapour or mist.

   2. His resolution, Yet do I not forget thy precepts.' I do not forget;
   that is, I do not decline from or neglect my duty; as Heb. xiii. 16, To
   distribute and communicate forget not,' that is, neglect it not. As on
   God's part, when he will not perform what belongeth to him, being
   hindered by our disobedience, he threateneth to forget his people, Jer.
   xxiii. 39, that is, will not deliver them; so we forget God's precepts
   when we do not fulfil, or neglect, our duty. Now, forget God's precepts
   he might either as his comfort or his rule; both ways must the word be
   improved and remembered by us; yet because the notion of precepts is
   here used, I understand the latter. Often is this passage repeated in
   this psalm; as ver. 51, The proud have had me greatly in derision, yet
   have I not declined from thy law.' Though scorned and made a mockage by
   those that were at ease, and lived in pomp and splendour, yet his zeal
   was not abated. Ver. 61, The bands of the wicked have robbed me; yet
   have I not forgotten thy law.' Though plundered by the violence of
   soldiers; so ver. 109, My soul is continually in my hand; yet do I not
   forget thy law:' that is, though he was in danger of death continually.
   We have it again, ver. 141, I am small and despised; yet do I not
   forget thy law:' though contemned and slighted as a useless creature,
   and one that might be well spared in the world. So in the text, I am
   become like a bottle in the smoke,' though wrinkled and shrivelled with
   age and sorrow. Thus in all temptations David's love to God and his
   ways was not abated.

   Doct. That though our trials be never so sharp and tedious, yet this
   must not lessen our respect to God or his word.

   In handling this point I shall show you three things:--

   1. That God may exercise his children with sharp and tedious
   afflictions.

   2. That these afflictions are apt to draw us into manifold sins and
   errors of practice.

   3. That yet this should not be; a gracious heart should withstand the
   shock of temptations.

   For the first, David is an instance, whose sad complaint we have had
   continued for three verses together. I shall only now open the
   similitude in the text, whereby he representeth his condition.

   1. A bottle in the smoke is dry and wrinkled and shrunk up; so he was
   worn out and dried up with sorrow and long suspense of expectation.
   This noteth the decay of his bodily strength. So also elsewhere: Ps.
   cii. 3, My days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burnt as an
   hearth.' And he saith, Ps. xxxii. 4, Thy hand was heavy upon me; my
   moisture is turned into the drought of summer.' His chief sap, oil, was
   spent, humidum radicale. As a leathern sack, long hung up in a smoking
   chimney, so was he dried up, and shrivelled and wrinkled by
   long-continued troubles and adversity. We are told, Prov. xvii. 22,
   that a merry heart doth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit
   drieth the bones.' A cheerful heart helpeth well to recover health
   lost, but a sad one breedeth diseases, as we see grief is often the
   cause of death. Now so it may often be with God's children. God may so
   follow them with afflictions that sorrow may waste their natural
   strength, and they may have such hard and long trials as to make them
   go into wrinkles, and what by temporal sorrows, troubles of conscience
   or sickness, the infirmities of age may be hastened upon them.

   2. A bottle in the smoke is blacked and smutched, whereby is meant that
   his beauty was wasted as well as his strength; and as he was withered,
   so he was black with extreme misery: Job xxx. 30, My skin is black upon
   me, and my bones are burnt with heat.' So Lam. v. 10, Our skin was
   black as an oven, because of the terrible famine.' So Lam. iv. 8, Their
   visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their
   skin cleaveth to their bones, it is withered, it is become like a
   stick.' So here like a bottle in the smoke.' And you must consider that
   this was spoken of David, that ruddy youth, of whom it was said, 1 Sam.
   xvi. 12, Now he was ruddy, of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to
   look to.' But great sorrows had made an alteration, and afflictions do
   quickly cause the beauty of the body to fade: Ps. xxxix. 11, When thou
   with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to
   consume away like a moth.' God's rod may leave sad marks and prints
   upon the body, which do not only waste our strength, but deface our
   beauty. Ob serve here the difference between the beauty and strength of
   the body and of the soul. The beauty of the soul groweth fairer by
   afflictions, whereas that of the body is blasted. David was a bottle
   shrivelled and shrunk up, yet the holy frame of his soul was not
   altered; his beauty was gone, but not his grace. Outward beauty is but
   skin-deep; turn it inside out, it is but blood and rawness. It fadeth
   by sickness, age, troubles of conscience, and great and manifold
   afflictions. Once more; in the sight of God a man is never the more
   uncomely, though he be as a skin-bottle in the smoke, if he doth not
   forget his statutes:' if he be outwardly deformed, but yet the hidden
   man of the heart be well adorned, even with the ornament of a meek and
   quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price, 1 Peter iii.
   3, 4. Any great affliction soon maketh an impression upon the skin.
   This flower of beauty is soon blown off; age or sickness will soon
   shrivel it up, and make it look like a bottle in the smoke; but let us
   regard the beauty of the soul, which fadeth not.

   3. A dried bottle in the smoke is contemned and cast aside and of no
   use; so was David no more esteemed and regarded among men than such a
   bottle would be; and to this Christ alludeth, Mat. ix. 17, Men do not
   put new wine into old bottles, lest the bottles break, and the wine
   runneth out and perisheth.' An old, dry shrivelled bottle is good for
   nothing, the force of wine will soon break and rend it, therefore it is
   cast away as a thing of no use. So many times, to the great grief of
   their hearts, may God's children be laid aside as useless vessels. The
   world may cast them off as unworthy to live among them: It is not for
   the king's profit to suffer them,' Esther iv. 8; and 1 Cor. iv. 13,
   perikatha'rmata, We are made as the filth of the world, and are the
   offscouring of all things.' So Heb. xiii. 13, Let us go forth therefore
   unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.' At that time they
   were cast out of the synagogues, or cities and societies. Was not
   Christ himself cast off, despised and rejected of men'? Isa. liii. 3,
   The stone which the builders refused:' though he were the corner stone
   of the building, yet they laid him aside as if he were of no use, as
   rubbish, or a refuse stone. So are his people thrust out by the world,
   laid by, as not deemed worthy to be employed for any use: Acts xxii.
   22, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he
   should live.' This is the judgment which the world maketh on God's
   servants.

   Secondly, What are the usual sins which are incident to such sharp and
   tedious afflictions?

   1. Impatience and murmuring against God. When our wills are crossed we
   cannot bear it. To be sick of the fret is a disease very incident to
   such as have not learned to deny their own wills, and entirely to give
   up themselves to the conduct of God's providence: Gen. xxx. 1, Give me
   children, or I die;' Ps. xxxvii. 1, Fret not thyself because of
   evil-doers.' We should not vex and fret, but we are apt to do so, to
   murmur and repine against God, and that for small matters, as Jonah for
   a gourd: I do well to be angry,' Jonah iv. 9. So strangely are men
   transported! Pettish desires earnestly solicited, and finally
   disappointed, breed this impatience in us. In every frame of heart,
   when notably stirred, we should say, Is this well? God puts the
   question to Jonah, Dost thou well to be angry?' What! to be
   discontented with Gods own providence, especially in small matters? But
   we let loose the reins to our passions, and if we be crossed a little,
   then Let me die.' Some of this impatience was in good David, for it
   presently followeth the text, ver. 84, How many are the days of thy
   servant?' If the affliction must last yet longer, then even let me know
   when I shall die.

   2. A spirit of revenge against the instruments of our trouble. When we
   dare not let fly against God, we vent our passions freely against men,
   and seek their hurt and loss, and think we are safe. Whereas
   Christianity establisheth a universal and diffusive charity, even to
   enemies, that we should pray for them, and seek their good: Mat. v. 44,
   Love.your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
   you, pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.' The
   command of love doth not extend only towards kindred and friends and
   acquaintance, but even to enemies. I say unto you, Christ will try our
   sincerity and obedience by this precept, by forgiving wrongs, and
   forbearing all unjust and unmerciful revenge, and our love by loving
   our enemies. It is hard to bring the revengeful heart of man to it. The
   faults they have committed against us do not exempt us from the general
   law of charity, from doing good to them according to our power. As we
   must not hate or curse, or requite injury with injury, so we must love,
   bless, do good, and pray for them, wishing them all the good in the
   world, especially that which they most want, the good of their souls;
   returning friendly words for railing and evil speaking; feeding and
   clothing them when hungry, thirsty, or naked; desiring pardon and
   grace. This is our rule; but how few Christians comply with it, and
   conquer their unruly passions 1 No; rather justify them by the
   greatness of their temptations, and if they be kept from retaliating of
   injuries, that is rare. Most have too great a coldness and indifference
   for enemies: Prov. xxiv. 29, I will do so to him as he hath done to me;
   I will render to the man according to his work.' This is to take the
   work out of God's hands, to review [8] the arrogance of Adam, Be as
   gods.' Generally men are vindictive and transported with uncomely
   passions when wronged by men: 2 Sam. xvi. 9, Why should this dead dog
   curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his
   head.' This was the ruffling humour of Abishai; but David was in a
   calmer, cooler frame and temper of spirit: No; God bid him curse.' Many
   a man can bear afflictions, but not injuries. No man is troubled at a
   shower of rain, but if one cast a bucket or basin of water upon us, we
   shall not let it pass, if it be in the power of our hands, without
   revenge.

   3. Using indirect means for our relief. It is better to pine away in
   affliction than to be freed from it by sin, to be as a bottle in the
   smoke than to forget our duty; therefore no trouble should drive us to
   sin, or to use sinful means for our escape; though worn out with
   expectation, let our duty hold our hands from evil. Whatever our
   trouble be, from the hand of God or men, we have no reason to go to the
   devil to ease us of it; as Saul goeth to the witch of Endor: 1 Sam.
   xxviii. 7, Seek me out a woman that hath a familiar spirit.' And to the
   devil we go when we use bad means. Carnal shifts are very natural to
   us, and when we cannot trust God, and depend upon him, we presently are
   apt to take some indirect course- of our own. Affliction is often
   compared to a prison, and the sorrows which accompany it to fetters and
   chains. Now, God, that puts us into prison, can only help us out again,
   for he is the governor and judge of the world. Now, to use carnal
   shifts is an attempt to break prison. We are not able to hold out till
   God send a happy issue, but take some carnal course of our own. If the
   heart be not the better resolved, thus it will be. The devil will make
   an advantage of our afflictions, if he can; he tempted Christ when he
   was hungry, Mat. iv. 3, so he tempteth us when he seeth us needy,
   disgraced, reproached, trampled under foot. No; though our estate be
   low, and the fountain of our supplies be dried up, though our credit be
   smutched and blacked with slander and reproach, though we be cast out
   as useless things, as an old withered skin-bottle, counted unfit to
   hold wine, yet we must not forget God's precepts. We need not take a
   sinful course for the vindication of our credit from unjust reproaches:
   Isa. li. 7, Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
   whose heart is my law: fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be
   afraid of their revilings.' You that make reckoning of keeping close to
   my word, that have my law not only in your heads, but in your hearts,
   God hath his times to vindicate you; you need not distrust the
   providence of God under straits. When Jacob was low, he tells Laban, My
   righteousness shall answer for me,' Gen. xxx. 33. The hand of God will
   help us and reward honest labours, without our being false or
   unfaithful to men. We need not make a foul retreat in the day of trial,
   nor shift for ourselves by complying with the lusts of men, nor wax
   weary of our duty as quite discouraged and disheartened, Heb. xii. 3,
   as we are apt to do when troubles are grievous, and long continued.

   4. Another evil is desponding and distrustful thoughts of God. David,
   after all his experiences, was surprised with this kind of thoughts: 1
   Sam. xxvii. 1, I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul.' He had a
   particular promise and assurance of the kingdom, and had seen much of
   God's care over him, and yet after all this David doubted of the word
   of God, and bewrayed his weakness of faith and affiance in him, who had
   watched over him, and delivered him out of many great and imminent
   dangers in a marvellous manner, when there was less appearance of hope
   than now, 1 Sam. xxii. 5; so Ps. xxxi. 22, I said in my haste, I am cut
   off from before thine eyes: nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my
   supplications, when I cried unto thee.' God hath no more care and
   thought of me than if I were not. This was said at the very time when
   deliverance was coming. Here David yielded a little to foolish haste,
   and lost the staidness of his faith: so Ps. lxxvii. 7, 8, Will the Lord
   cast off for ever? will he be favour able no more? is his mercy clean
   gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?' Questions to
   appearance full of despair and despondency, yet there is some faith
   couched under them. Will the Lord cast off? It implieth the soul cannot
   endure to be thrust from him. Will he be favourable no more? It
   implieth some former experience, and desire of new proof. Is his mercy
   clean gone? I have deserved all this, but God is merciful. Will not
   mercy help? To appearance indeed despair carrieth it from faith; that
   is upper most

   5. Questioning our interest in God merely because of the cross. Our
   Lord hath taught us to say My God in the bitterest agonies; but few
   learn this lesson: Judges vi. 13, If God be with us, why is all this
   befallen us?' As if they were never exercised with trouble who have God
   with them. Sometimes we question the love of God because we have no
   afflictions, and anon because we have nothing but afflictions; as if
   God were not the God of the valleys as well as of the mountains, and
   his love did change with our outward condition, and worldly prosperity
   were a mark of grace, which, when lost, our evidence were gone. How
   hardly soever God dealeth with his people, yet he loveth them: Heb.
   xii. 6, Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth:' so Rev. iii. 19, As many
   as I love, I rebuke and chasten.' A father is a father when he smileth
   and when he frowneth; he may have love in his heart when a rod in his
   hand; and we have no reason to question our adoption merely because we
   are put under the correction and discipline of the family.

   6. Not only despairing thoughts do arise, but atheistical thoughts, as
   if there were no God, no providence, no distinction between good and
   evil, and it were in vain to serve him: Ps. lxxiii. 13, I have cleansed
   my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.' The flesh is
   importunate to be pleased, and therefore, when it meeteth not with
   desired satisfaction, we are apt to question all, and to cast off the
   fear of God, and all regard of his service: Mal. iii. 14, Ye have said,
   It is in vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his
   ordinance, and walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?' When
   temptations are sore, and afflictions tedious, thoughts of so horrid a
   complexion may float in our minds.

   These are the distempers which are incident to those who have been long
   afflicted, and are often disappointed in the issue which they expect.

   Thirdly, That this should not be. David omitted not his duty for all
   this, though his troubles were long and tedious. How great soever our
   trials be, they should not weaken our love to God and our respect to
   his word. God's precepts must not be forgotten, though we are withered
   and dried up with sorrows, as a skin-bottle is shrivelled in the smoke.

   1. Because then we plunge ourselves into a greater evil, if we fall
   into sin because of trouble and affliction, and so make our condition
   so much, the worse. Job's friends charged this upon him, that he had
   chosen sin rather than affliction, Job xxxvi. 21, when he would rather
   give way to impatience than patiently bear what God had laid upon him.
   Many are so transported with their pains and grievances that they care
   not what they say or do, as if they were loosed from all bands of duty.
   On the contrary, it is said of Moses, Heb. xi. 25, Choosing rather to
   suffer afflictions,' &c. The least sin is worse than the greatest
   suffering. Suffering is an offence done to us; sin is an offence done
   to God. By suffering we lose some worldly comfort, but by sinning
   hazard the favour of God. Suffering is only an inconvenience to the
   bodily or animal life; sinning bringeth a blot and blemish upon the
   soul. The sinful state is far worse than the afflicted. And therefore,
   how calamitous soever our condition be, we must take great care it be
   not sinful. Wormwood is bitter, but not poison.

   2. A sincere love to God will make us adhere to him when he seemeth to
   deal most hardly with us. Among all his corrections, God hath not a rod
   smart enough to drive away a gracious and loving soul from himself: Ps.
   xliv. 17, All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor
   dealt falsely in thy covenant.' God is the same, and his ways are the
   same, though his dispensations be changed; so different a thing it is
   to love the ways of God upon foreign and upon intrinsic and proper
   reasons; and the intent of such dispensations is to put us upon
   trial,--what be our reasons and motives why we love God and his ways,
   and whether our love be strong enough to encounter with difficulties,
   whether it can overcome temptations from sense and the world. Till all
   probabilities be spent, and our afflictions grow long and tedious, we
   are not tried to the purpose. Our covenant vow to God bindeth us to own
   him in all conditions, whatever our portion be in the world.

   3. By forgetting God's precepts we put away our own comfort from
   ourselves, and make our afflictions the more grievous. Take the word
   precepts either strictly, for his commandments or statutes, or more
   largely, as it may also include his promises. If any faint and fail in
   trouble, it is because they trust not the promises, or keep not the
   commandments of God: these two mutually strengthen one another. If you
   would not have your faith broken, labour to keep the commandments. In
   the 166th verse of this psalm, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done
   thy commandments.' And if you would keep the commandments, confirm your
   faith in the promises of forgiveness of sin, of God's providence, and
   eternal life; for if thou canst believe these, no pleasure or pain
   shall make thee forsake thy obedience, Ps. cxxx. 4. A child of God
   dareth not warp and turn away from God, in part or in whole, nor
   slacken any part of his diligence in God's service. Faith in God's
   promises breedeth obedience, and obedience confirmeth faith in God's
   promises. We apprehend promises to check that sensitive lure which
   would entice us from God and our obedience to him. A greater benefit is
   offered to counterbalance the baits and troubles of the flesh. The more
   we obey the precepts the more we believe the promises; for together
   with our obedience, our confidence and sound comfort increaseth: so
   that to forget the word is to throw away our strength from ourselves.

   4. Afflictions rightly improved are a means to make us remember God's
   precepts rather than to forget them, Heb. xii. 11. The baits of the
   flesh are removed that the spirit may be more at liberty, 2 Cor. iv.
   16. God seeth fit to afflict the bodies of his people sometimes. The
   body, being in good plight, is a clog to the soul; therefore they are
   withered and wrinkled that the soul may thrive the more. Our worldly
   portion is blasted that our heavenly treasure may be increased. When we
   are at full we wax wanton, neglectful, forget his precepts. Now, that
   we may remember them the more, God sendeth such afflictions which sit
   near and close. The moon is never eclipsed but when it is at full; so
   many have eclipsed the glory of the spiritual life when full and at
   ease: therefore in afflictions we should not forget his word.

   Use 1. To reprove us who are so soon discouraged in the ways of God. If
   we surfer but a little sickness, and a little trouble and contempt in
   the world, a little loss of honour and interest, the mocks and scorns
   of foolish men, we cannot bear it, but murmur and are impatient. David
   could submit himself to the Lord, and find sweetness in the word,
   though he were like a bottle in the smoke.' Few now-a-days suffer any
   great matter for Christ. Surely when God's people have endured harder
   things, we should be ashamed of our tenderness. Were we only appointed
   to escape the afflictions and inconveniences of our pilgrimage? And
   must God make a new way to heaven for our sakes, wherein we shall meet
   with no difficulty in our passage? Or rather, in defiance of all sense,
   would we abide here for ever, and flourish in ease and plenty, and
   never see change? No; it becometh us betimes to prepare for the cross.
   None so strong now but they shall wither, so ruddy and beautiful but
   their beauty shall consume as a moth; nor so happy and flourishing in
   honour and esteem but they will be laid aside as a dried, withered
   bottle. We must look to have our turn, and bear it patiently.

   2. Let us not for any afflictions and troubles whatsoever abate of our
   zeal and diligence and respect to God's service.

   First, It is not obedience to God's precepts or godliness that is the
   cause of our sufferings and chastenings, but our sin and folly: Micah
   ii. 7, Are these his doings? do not my wools do good to him that
   walketh uprightly?' God delighteth not in dealing harshly with his
   people. The rod is not that he taketh pleasure in, if our case do not
   call for it: Lam. iii. 33, He afflicts not willingly.' We provoke him
   to it. And shall we grow weary of his service because we suffer justly
   for our sins? There is reason indeed why we should grow weary of sin,
   Jer. ii. 19; we find the bitterness of it; but no reason why we should
   grow weary of duty. Sin less and suffer less. Provoke not God, and
   nothing will proceed from him but what is good and comfortable; he doth
   not punish or chasten men for holiness and well doing; no, it is for
   want of holiness. Shall the physician be blamed for the trouble of
   physic, when the patient hath contracted a surfeit that makes it
   necessary? It was sin in general brought us into a state of suffering,
   and particular errors that actually bring it on.

   Secondly, The benefits and fruit of afflictions should allay and
   abundantly recompense the trouble of them, that they should not be a
   hindrance or a snare, but a help to godliness. They prevent our surfeit
   of worldly prosperity, which would cost us dearer than all the troubles
   of the flesh which we meet with. Alas! what sad work doth honour and
   wealth and power make in the world! Blessed be God that he keepeth us
   under, low, humble, and contemned, like bottles in the smoke. Shall a
   little affliction, which saveth us from these opportunities of
   discovering our corruption, be so resented by us as that we should wax
   weary of God and forget his precepts? Great and long prosperity would
   be a sorer temptation to us than sharp and tedious affliction; the one
   keepeth us modest and humble, whereas the other would make us vain and
   proud and wanton. When Jeshurun waxed fat he kicked:' Deut. xxxii. 15,
   He forsook God that made him, and lightly esteemed the rock of his
   salvation;' slighted God, and grew cold in duty, ready to sin. As a
   rank soil breedeth weeds, a pleasant estate doth but fill us with
   vanity and folly.

   Thirdly, God in good time will send help and deliverance. If we
   remember to plead the promise, God will remember to fulfil the promise.
   And those who are not unmindful of their duty, God will not be
   unmindful of their safety: Mal. iii. 16, The Lord hearkened and heard;
   and a book of remembrance was written before him, for those that feared
   the Lord, and thought upon his name.' You see there that God will not
   forget those that forget not his word. Those that keep their feet in
   the worst times, when others reel and stagger, God hath a great care of
   them. Every word you speak for God, every inconvenience you suffer for
   him, every duty you perform to him, it is all upon record.

   Fourthly, We may with the more confidence recommend our case to God:
   Ps. cxix. 153, Consider mine affliction, and deliver me, for I do not
   forget thy law.' They that do not make haste to deliver themselves, God
   will deliver them. The same God that requireth duty doth assure them of
   comfort

SERMON XCII.

   The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.--Ver.
   85.

   THIS verse containeth a complaint against his enemies, whereas most of
   the other verses express his affection to the law of God. Yea, this
   verse strongly implieth it; for he censureth and condemneth his enemies
   mainly upon this ground, because they did what they pleased, without
   any regard to that law which he himself took to be the rule of his
   duty, and the charter of his hopes and happiness. Observe three
   things:--

   1. The character of David's enemies, the proud.

   2. Their practice, or subtle and treacherous dealing with him, they
   have digged pits for me.

   3. David's censure of that practice, or their manifest iniquity, which
   are not after thy law.

   Let us explain the words.

   The proud.--In the scripture it signifieth--(1.) Either the wicked in
   general: Ps. cxix. 21, Thou hast rebuked the proud which are cursed,
   which do err from thy commandments.' It is a horrible arrogancy to
   oppose God's laws and interests in the world. (2.) More particularly
   such as are puffed up with worldly happiness and success, and so either
   Saul's or Absalom's counsellors may be intended.

   Have digged pits for me.--A metaphorical phrase, usual in scripture, to
   represent the secret plots and treacherous dealings of wicked enemies;
   an allusion to them who dig pits to take wild beasts. In the Greek it
   is, They have told me tales.' Though this rendering was occasioned by a
   mistake of the word, yet it agreeth well enough with the sense, for
   this digging of pits by false pretences and ensnaring counsels: Prov.
   xvi. 27, An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is as a
   burning fire.' But let us keep to the translation we have. The manner
   of toils among the Jews was digging pits, and covering them over, and
   hiding snares in them, that as the beast pressed the clod, and fell
   therein, he might be caught, and kept from getting out again. Therefore
   David saith, Ps. xxxv. 7, Without cause have they hid for me their net
   in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.'

   Which are not offer thy law.--Heb., Not after thy law.' It may refer to
   the men or the practice; who walk not according to thy law, or which
   fraudulent practices of theirs are not agreeable to thy law. The law of
   God condemned pits for tame beasts: Exod. xxi. 33, 34, If a man open a
   pit, or dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or ass fall therein, the
   owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money to the owners of
   them.' Though it was lawful for hunters to take wild beasts, yet they
   were to take heed that a tame beast fell not therein, at their peril.
   Yet not for men innocent, and holy men. But there is a litotes in the
   words. That is said not to be good or well done which is extremely
   evil, very contrary to thy law. Thus we are wont to speak of a tiling
   horrid in terms of extenuation; as when we speak of a fact, It is not
   very commendable, when we mean it is extremely abominable. So crafty
   and subtle dealing consenteth not with the truth of God's word; that
   is, it is extremely opposite to it. This is produced by David as a
   ground of his confidence, why he hoped he should not be taken in these
   pits. These practices were not only injurious to himself, but
   contemptuous of the law of God. He layeth forth his enemies' carriage
   before God. Note--

   1. That secret plottings against the interests of God and his people in
   the world are an ancient practice.

   2. That these plots usually begin in pride.

   3. That God can, when he will, and usually doth, protect his people
   against the plots of the proud, or the fraud as well as the violence of
   enemies.

   4. That God's law forbiddeth all mischievous, ungodly, treacherous
   designs, attempts, and actions.

   5. That the innocent should not be much troubled to be maligned and
   hated by them who contemn God's laws, as well as oppose his people.

   I shall gloss on these points, and then close all with application.

   First point. That secret plottings against the interest of God and his
   people are an ancient practice.

   David here complaineth that the proud had digged pits for him; and Ps.
   xxxvii. 12, The wicked plotteth against the just;' yea, ver. 7, it is a
   description of a wicked man, The man who bringeth wicked devices to
   pass.' It is so known a practice that it is gotten into their name and
   style. A wicked man's brain is a forge that is always hot. So Ps. vii.
   14, Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,
   and brought forth falsehood.' Wicked men conceive, and then travail,
   but usually the birth proveth abortive. To represent the truth to you,
   I shall give you a draught of some of the designs of wicked men:--(1.)
   For the suppressing of God's interest and people in the world. (2.)
   Private persons.

   For the first, you cannot imagine that I should unravel all the secrets
   of the kingdom of darkness, and break open the devil's cabinet. I shall
   only point at some few plots and contrivances for the ruin of God's
   interest in the world.

   First, Plots to foment and promote divisions, either between them and
   themselves, them and their rulers, or them and God himself.

   1. Them and themselves. Ever since God had a people in the world, the
   devil and his instruments have sought to divide them, that they may
   first ruin one another, and then become a prey to their common
   adversaries. Nothing hath hindered the growth of Christianity so much
   as the spirit of division. Pollou`s christiani'zein ape'trapen
   (Sozomen). And Chrysostom's elthen e'thnikos ti`s, in his homilies upon
   the Acts: there came a certain ethnic to him, and told him, I would
   fain be a Christian, but there are so many parties among you that I
   know not to whom I should join myself. And Christ's prayer intimates,
   John xvii. 21, That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me,'
   &c. The world are apt to look upon Christ as an imposter, and his
   religion as a fond superstition, when they see his people so divided
   and scattered one from another. Divisions in the church breed atheism
   in the world. Now Satan and wicked men have endeavoured all they can to
   keep up these divisions and hatred among Christians. This was Julian
   the apostate's design. When he had a mind to suppress Christianity, he
   did not openly persecute it, but took the worst sort of Christians and
   upheld them, that they might still maintain a quarrel between them and
   others. In Germany the Jesuits go over to the Lutherans to keep up the
   difference; they blow the coals, and then warm themselves by the flame.
   And among us the envious man hath sown tares: Is not the hand of Joab
   in all this?' By what spirit are the Quakers and others acted, and why
   are these things kept up, but to render Christianity odious? Sanballat
   and Tobias set up a party among the Jews to hinder the work of their
   restoration, Ezra iv. 4, that they might foment division among them,
   and so hinder the growth of the people's prosperity, for they had now
   the countenance of the king of Babylon, and by this means they thought
   to do so.

   2. To divide between them and their rulers. The devil knoweth what an
   advantage it is to religion to have the countenance of princes, and, on
   the other side, how jealous they are of their authority and
   prerogative; and therefore by his instruments seeketh to prejudice and
   prepossess them against it, and those that profess it in strictness and
   power. Thus Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
   Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the
   house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words,' Amos vii.
   10. He chargeth him with treason and open rebellion, that he withdrew
   subjects from their duty, and excited the people against his authority,
   and this by clancular insinuation, when Amos was not called or heard.
   Thus they pretend great friendship to authority, to sharpen the rage of
   princes against God's servants. So Ezra iv. 12, Be it known unto the
   king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto
   Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city,' &c. So Saul
   against David, as appears by his expostulation with him about it: 1
   Sam. xxiv. 9, Wherefore nearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David
   seeketh thy hurt?' So Haman against the Jews: Esther iii. 8, Haman said
   unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad, and
   dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and
   their laws are diverse from all people, neither keep they the king's
   laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.' So in
   primitive times; thus did they take the Christians, who were most
   innocent, though they were more numerous; yet still they were faithful
   to their prince: Bibamus pro salute imperatoris; they would rather
   endure to die than venture upon it, for they did apprehend it as a
   heathen sacrifice. Thus whisperers make princes conceive an ill opinion
   of religious men.

   3. To divide between them and God. The devil turneth every stone. Would
   you ever think malice should rise so high as to disengage God from the
   protection of his people, and to disaffect him against them? How can it
   be? Have Satan and his instruments a plot upon God himself? What else
   should be the meaning of all his temptations? But see Balaam's plot,
   Micah. vi. 5, O my people, remember what Balak the king of Moab
   consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered from Shittim unto
   Gilgal,' &c. Balak and Balaam are framing a project how to overcome the
   Israelites, and that can never be as long as God is with them; and how
   shall they do to get away God from them? Jehovah was not as a heathen
   god, to be called out by sacrifices and enchantments, as they had their
   charms and rites among the heathens to call out their tutelar gods from
   among the nations against whom they came to fight. Macrobius hath a
   chapter, De Ritu evocandi Deos. They were now to deal with the God of
   Israel, who would not be moved with such deceits and blandishments;
   therefore they will have a plot to disengage him from his people. It is
   insinuated, Num. xxiv. 14, Come now, and I will advertise thee what
   thou shalt do.' Moses doth not express the counsel given, because it
   was whispered secretly into Balak's ear; therefore you see the sense is
   imperfect in that place, and indeed there is a pause in the Hebrew, to
   show that something must be supplied. But what the plot was may be
   known by the effect, in the 25th of Numbers, and is in brief set forth,
   Rev. ii. 14, where it is said of Balaam, that he caused Balak to lay a
   stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed
   to idols, and to commit fornication.' This was the plot, to send some
   beautiful women of Midian to wander about the camp of Israel, to tempt
   their lusty youth and martial men first to uncleanness and then to
   idolatry, that so God might be provoked against them--a plot so full of
   refined malice, that it can hardly be paralleled. Thus the devil and
   his instruments play their part sufficiently, to divide God's people,
   to prejudice their rulers, yea, to disaffect God himself.

   Secondly, Plots to discourage and suppress religion. So there are many
   ways which wicked men take. Who can name them all? I shall only
   instance in two policies of Julian the apostate, the most refined
   instrument the devil used either for wit or malice; two ways especially
   did he seek to undermine religion.

   1. One was to forbid the use of schools to the Christians, and sup
   press human learning. To make a people irreligious, the way is to make
   them ignorant; discourage learning, and piety will not be long in
   fashion, not able long to maintain itself: in the dark men will adore
   any fancy. This was like Nahash his condition to Jabesh Gilead, Put out
   their right eye.' God's two famous instruments who wrote most both of
   the Old and New Testament, Paul and Moses, were both excellently
   skilled in secular learning.

   2. Another was to put none to death for religion, but to oppress them
   with all manner of vexations and discouragements. To put them to death
   he apprehended to be glorious; but sometimes banished them towns. As
   Athanasius [9] deprived them of all offices civil and military, wasted
   them with burdensome levies and exactions: Let us make them poor, saith
   he scoffingly, for it is a hard matter for the rich to enter into the
   kingdom of heaven.

   The devil doth his work more cleverly and handsomely when Christians
   are not called out to the fire and gibbet, but are wasted by lingering
   inconveniences and loss of privileges.

   Thirdly, Plots to introduce persecution.

   1. Defamation. Infamy is the forerunner of more trouble, and the
   showers of slander are but presages of grievous storms of persecution.
   The devil is first a liar and then a murderer, John viii. 44. When the
   children of God are represented as criminal, they are more easily
   destroyed. It was a fashion in the primitive persecutions to invest
   Christians with a bear's skin, and then to bait them as bears. And it
   is a usual practice of Satan and his instruments to blast the repute of
   religious persons, to clothe them with the livery of reproach, and then
   prosecute them as offenders: Ps. v. 9, Their throat is an open
   sepulchre.' The slanders of the wicked are preparatives to death, as
   the sepulchre when opened is prepared to receive the dead carcase. Men
   first slander and then molest The devil is afraid to meddle with
   unstained innocency. A good report is a great security against open
   violence.

   2. To destroy the church, under the pretence of the church; as the
   beast in the Revelations pushed with the horns of the lamb, Rev. xiii.
   11. It was a proverb, All evil began in the name of the Lord--In nomine
   Domini incipit omne malum. And it hath been a false pretended zeal for
   the church that hath of later years raised and fomented all or most of
   the persecutions of Christians.

   3. To destroy Christians upon the pretence of civil quarrels and laws,
   and to disguise hatred against religion under a pretence of public
   peace; kill you, as well as cast you out of the synagogue. Dan. vi. 4,
   the Persian noblemen sought to find occasion against Daniel because of
   the kingdom, though they found none.'

   4. To make way for errors and falsehoods; so many pits do the wicked
   dig to beguile unwary and unstable souls, sometimes by more than
   ordinary pretences of love, meekness, and sweetness. They come to you
   in sheep's clothing,' saith our Lord, but inwardly are ravening
   wolves,' Mat. vii. 15. Sheep's clothing, that is, all for love and
   kindness, and so steal away the hearts of the people, as Absalom by his
   submission and servile flattery. And then by debasing, opposing, and
   crying down a faithful ministry. Demosthenes' fable of the wolves
   agreeing with the sheep in lusu [10] would send away their dogs. Now
   thus they do by questioning their calling, as the false teachers did
   Paul's; and we have been so long unministering one another, that all
   ministry is hated in the hearts of many an anti-ministerial spirit.
   Sometimes by decrying maintenance. The lamp is starved when not
   supplied with oil. Some, to gain credit and entrance, and to disgrace
   Paul and the true evangelic ministers, whose poverty needed a supply,
   will take no maintenance; therefore Paul saith, 2 Cor. xi. 12, That
   wherein they glory we might be as they;' but there is no end of raking
   in this puddle.

   Secondly, Private persons. Cain against Abel, drew him into the field,
   disputed with him about God and providence and the world to come, Gen.
   iv. The princes of Darius against Daniel, Dan. vi. The kingdom was but
   newly subdued by the Medes: this would try the affection of his
   subjects; no request to be made to God or man for thirty days. The
   Medes and Persians were wont to ascribe divine honours to their kings,
   as Brissonius proveth. The report of this reverence would be glorious.
   Religion was at stake; therefore Daniel would venture the lions' den.
   Judas's treason against Christ: Luke xxii. 3, The devil entered into
   Judas.' The Jews' laying in wait for Paul: Acts xxiii. 12-14, Certam
   Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, or oath of
   execration, that they would not eat or drink till they had killed Paul:
   and they were more than forty that had made this conspiracy.' And this
   they would do with the consent of the chief priests, as he was coming
   to the Sanhedrim. A parallel in the fifth of November. So Jezebel's
   plot against Naboth for his vineyard; makes use of God's name and
   worship to bring it about, 1 Kings xxi. 8-10. But I must stop, being
   carried beyond my first intention: plotted mischiefs are an ancient
   practice.

   Use of all. How much are we obliged to God's providence, who doth not
   only defend us against open violence, but secret machinations f It is
   the Lord taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and disappointeth the
   counsels of wicked men against his people, Job v. 12. Many things are
   contrived against us in the dark that we know not and see not, but the
   eye of the Lord watcheth for us: Isa. viii. 10, Take counsel together,
   and it shall come to nought: speak the word, and it shall not stand,
   for God is with us.'

   Second point. That these plots usually begin in pride; for David saith
   here, The proud have digged pits for me.' Therefore it is pride that
   puts men upon designs of mischief and ruin to others. Pride showeth
   itself in the envy of superiors, contention with equals, or the disdain
   of inferiors.

   1. Take pride as it venteth itself by envy at any excellency, or sup
   posed excellency, in others. Search the scriptures, and you will say
   this puts men upon plotting the mischief of their neighbours' religious
   eminency. Man cannot endure to be outstripped in religion; therefore
   men malign and hate what they will not imitate, and then seek to
   destroy and undermine God's people. It was Abel's goodness that made
   Cain plot against him, to draw him into the field that he might kill
   him, 1 John iii. 12. The power of godliness is an eyesore to those that
   would look no further than the form of it. Or it may be the men of the
   world do envy the godly should thrive by them. This made the presidents
   lay a snare and gin for Daniel. When the gospel is likely to get
   credit, the Jews, moved with envy,' seek to suppress it, Acts xvii. 5.
   Pride is loath to stoop, or to see opposites in any honour and request.
   The Pharisees conspired to take Christ: John xii. 19, Perceive ye how
   ye prevail nothing? the whole world is gone after him.' They were
   galled to the heart to see such flocking and resorting to Christ after
   he had raised Lazarus from the dead. Some men will neither serve Christ
   themselves, nor endure that others should do it, therefore Christ must
   be taken out of the way. The plots of Sanballat and Tobias were their
   envy at the Jews.

   2. As pride venteth itself by contention with equals; for only by pride
   cometh contention.' Thus the Jews conspired to kill Paul; they looked
   upon him as one that had cried down the customs of their nation. This
   made Absalom plot the death of Amnon, because of the quarrel he had
   with him, and the dishonour he had done his sister: he bids him to
   dinner, and plieth him with cups till he is merry, and then killeth
   him, 2 Sam. xiii. 22.

   3. As it venteth itself by the disdain of underlings. Haman could not
   endure to see Mordecai in the king's gate, Esther v. 13, and therefore
   contriveth how to root him out and all his nation. Pride disdaineth the
   meanness of God's people, and that they should have any subsistence,
   and think they may oppress them freely, and root them out: Ps. cxxiii.
   4, We are filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with
   the contempt of the proud.' They scorn the people of God, and think
   they may do what they please with them without control.

   Well, then, this informeth us how much we should look to things
   betimes. The wickedness of David's enemies began in pride, went on in
   malicious plotting, and then they stick at no iniquity. When once we
   are engaged in a course of sin, there is usually no stop. Pride in some
   sense is the original of all wickedness, but more especially of
   malicious dealing with the people of God: Ps. x. 2, The wicked, in the
   pride of his heart, doth persecute the poor.' The godly many times are
   in a mean condition when their adversaries are in power, and can easily
   oppress them as underlings; but men forget the great God, who is their
   defender, and whose work and business it is to cast down the proud:
   James iv. 6, antita'ssetai, he standeth in battle array. And proud they
   are certainly who use their power to oppression, and care not what
   terms they put upon them.

   Third point. That God can, when he will, and usually doth, protect his
   people against the plots of the proud; for therefore David bringeth the
   cause before God.

   First, That God can, when he will, protect his people against the fraud
   and violence of their enemies. There are two grounds of trust--his
   wisdom, and the vigilancy of his providence.

   1. His wisdom. As we have God's power to trust in against their
   violence, so God's wisdom against their frauds and deceits: Job xii.
   13, With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
   understanding.' Wisdom implieth his accurate knowledge of things;
   counsel, his advised government of them; wisdom, his disposing and
   ordering things aright with respect to their ends. He hath
   understanding to find out all secrets, counsel to know fit means to
   bring his purposes to pass, and wisdom to order the means for attaining
   these ends.

   Observe there, first, how wisdom and strength are there coupled; as in
   that text, so elsewhere: Job ix. 4, He is wise in heart, and mighty in
   strength.' As he hath wisdom to judge, so power to execute or effect
   all his counsels. So Job xxxvi. 5, Behold God is mighty in strength and
   wisdom.' There is no standing out against supreme wisdom and invincible
   power; both together make God the most dreadful enemy and the most
   desirable friend.

   Observe, again, how God's wisdom is set forth by these three words,
   understanding, counsel, wisdom, to assure the hearts of the faithful
   that the gates of hell shall not prevail against' the church of God,
   Mat. xvi. 18. In the gates anciently was their strength, and there
   their magistrates and council sat. Now, they that believe that God is
   wise, of whom should they be afraid? Prov. xxi. 30, There is no wisdom
   nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord.' There may be wisdom,
   counsel, and understanding in the enemies of the gospel; and in the
   Lord there is wisdom and strength, counsel and understanding. Only
   against him there is the wisdom, counsel, and understanding of the
   creature; in him, of the creator. Surely the wisdom, counsel, and
   understanding of the creature can do nothing without him, nothing
   against him. Not without him, for it is dependent; whatever the
   creature hath it cometh from him; otherwise our understanding is but
   ignorance, our counsel rashness, our wisdom folly. Pharaoh thought to
   go wisely to work, Exod. i. 10; but that wisdom costs dear when it
   tends to suppress God's interest. Ahab, when God threatened to cut off
   his posterity, begets seventy sons, bestowed them in fenced cities, 2
   Kings x. 1; but those seventy sons were slain. Herod thought to go
   wisely to work, to destroy him that was born king of the Jews in the
   cradle; but Christ was preserved for all that. The synagogue of Satan
   is hatching crafty counsels to destroy the spouse of Christ, but with
   what effect? The man of sin is consumed more and more. We are afraid of
   our subtle enemies, but are we in such straits as God knoweth not how
   to bring us out? They cannot outwit the Lord. Whatever is plotted in
   Rome or hell against us, God knoweth it, for he hath understanding; God
   counter-worketh it, for he hath counsel; therefore they will but play
   the fool, for he hath wisdom. He heareth every word they say, knoweth
   their secret juggling, is at work for those that depend upon him;
   therefore let us rest in God's wisdom, and not be disquieted with every
   rumour.

   2. The care and vigilancy of his providence. It is emphatically
   expressed in two places: Heb. xiii. 5, 6, He hath said, I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee; so that we may boldly say, The Lord is my
   helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me;' and Ps. cxxi.
   4, Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.' In
   both there is a negative gradation. His eyelids try the children of
   men; the Lord waketh for us all.

   Secondly, That usually he doth protect his people against the plots of
   the proud, and bringeth the mischief they intend to others upon their
   own heads: Job xv. 35, They conceive mischief and bring forth vanity,
   and their belly prepareth deceit.' But to keep the notion of the text:
   Ps. vii. 15, He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
   which he made;' Ps. ix. 15, 16, The Lord is known by the judgment which
   he executeth: the wicked is snared by the work of his own hand: they
   are sunk down into the pit they digged; in the net which they hid is
   their own feet taken.' So Ps. xxxv. 7, 8, For without cause have they
   hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for
   my soul. Let destruction come upon him at unawares, and let his net
   that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him
   fall;' and Ps. x. 2, Let them be taken in the device they have
   imagined;' and Ps. lvii. 6, They have prepared a net for my step; my
   soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, in the midst
   whereof they are fallen themselves.' All these places show how usual it
   is that their devices do not succeed; yea, that the wicked cannot take
   a nearer course to ruin themselves than to seek the overthrow of God's
   church and people. All their machinations turn to their own loss, and
   the mischief they design to others falls constantly on themselves. As a
   stone thrown up or an arrow shot up against heaven returneth upon the
   head of him that throweth it, their acts and attempts of hurting others
   are converted to their own ruin, and destruction seizeth upon them by
   that very means by which they thought to bring it upon other men. This
   God doth, partly as they are proud, as they despise God and his people:
   Ps. x. 4, The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek
   after God; God is not in all his thoughts.' They are so confident of
   all they design, that they will not so much as call upon God for a
   blessing: this is so firmly laid, that all things shall succeed. They
   will not seek after God through the pride of their countenance; or
   suppose they should pray, it is but as Balaam offering sacrifice to
   entice God to curse his own people. The Lord telleth us, Prov. xxi:27,
   The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more when he
   bringeth it with a wicked mind?' Partly because of God's care and
   respect to his people: The poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art
   the helper of the fatherless,' Ps. x. 14. He trusts his all with God,
   who is the patron of the innocent and oppressed.

   Use 1. To direct us to carry the cause to God, as David in the text:
   Ps. lxxxiii. 2-4, For lo, thine enemies make a tumult, and they that
   hate thee have lift up the head: they have taken crafty counsel against
   thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones: they have said,
   Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of
   Israel may be no more in remembrance.' You must make the Lord the party
   still against the wicked. So Ps. xxxvii. 12, The wicked plotteth
   against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.' The wicked
   plotteth; but do the just countermine him? No; the Lord interposeth; he
   laugheth at him. It is a mighty support to the soul to oppose his
   justice to their wickedness, his omnipotency to their power, his wisdom
   to their craft, his love to their enmity. They are in God's hands, and
   cannot stir without him: as if one designed to poison me, but cannot do
   it without my father's consent. Wicked men are full of their boasts,
   but their brags and threats are but as the brags of a man on the
   scaffold, who is ready to be executed. Their day is coming.

   2. When God doth so it must be acknowledged with thankfulness and
   praise; yea, though an old mercy, Micah vi. 5. The godly are preserved
   though there be pits digged for them. Surely such experiences ought
   much to engage his people's hearts to him, for it showeth how mindful
   he is of their safety and welfare. Blessed be God that yet we subsist,
   that their devices are disappointed, and their designs brought on them,
   what they had projected against others.

   Fourth point. That God's law forbiddeth all ungodly, treacherous
   designs, attempts, and actions.

   As contrary to justice. To design mischief and treachery against the
   life of any is the guise of wicked men.

   As contrary to sincerity and godly simplicity: 2 Cor. i. 12, For our
   rejoicing is this, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with
   fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
   in the world, and more abundantly to you-wards.' Crafty and subtle
   dealings consenteth not with those that profess to direct their ways by
   the word of God.

   As contrary to charity and mercy, which we owe to all men. How God hath
   guarded the life of the innocent by his precepts, and what a base
   perverse spirit it is to dig pits for them.

   Use. Here is some plea for religion. It is not feralis superstitio.
   Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum? It is not a false, unnatural,
   unkind superstition, when men, under pretence of it, commit such evils,
   digging pits, laying mines and barrels of gunpowder, that religion
   should persuade all this. The world thinks that religion is a sour
   superstition, that it makes men ill-natured. No; it is the peaceablest
   and meekest thing that can be. A false religion indeed efferates the
   mind, begets a bloody spirit: Jude 11, Gone in the way of Cain;' in the
   way of blood and murder. They that have either a false religion, or are
   false in the true religion, indeed they are ill-natured and possessed
   with a rough spirit, unfit for human society. The true religion, which
   God hath established in his law, is the meekest thing in all the world.

   Fifth point. That the innocent should not be much troubled to be
   maligned and hated by them who contemn God's laws. Why?

   For their wickedness, fraudulency, and cruelty is a certain prognostic
   of their ruin. The more their sins are aggravated, their judgment
   cometh the sooner. God's law is wronged, as well as our interest
   endangered.

   It is a great ease to the conscience of the godly that they dig pits
   for us without a cause, Ps. xxxv. 7. The most godly and innocent may
   have pits digged for them. It encourageth us in our addresses to God,
   that we have no enemies but those who are enemies to God also and his
   ways; and the most wicked men are most violent against God's people.
   Who was it first raged against the Christians but Nero? And what a
   beast was Nero! That must needs be some great good that was condemned
   by Nero, but it was an honour and credit to religion to have such an
   enemy as Nero: Ps. v. 10, Let them fall by their own counsels; cast
   them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have
   rebelled against thee.' It is some argument of confidence that their
   ruin is coming.

   Use. What use shall God's people make of the whole for themselves?

   1. Never to engage in any design but what will suit with God's word,
   and you may commend to God in prayer. Do not dig pits which are not
   after God's law. Examine it according to rule. Never break a law for
   safety, nor for the best ends in the world dispense with your duty to
   God or man. It is horrible distrust of God's promises to venture upon
   the breach of his precepts for our pretended safety. Take heed of doing
   anything or carrying any plot against God's law, unless you would be
   like the enemies of the gospel.

   2. Walk with greater simplicity, without that guile and double-dealing
   and serpentine wisdom that is so proper to wicked men. He that walketh
   uprightly walketh safely. Protection holds good for the road and not
   for byways, 2 Cor. i. 12. The proud are those that dig pits; the
   character of those that shall have pardon for their sins is this, In
   whose spirit there is no guile.' A guileful spirit ill suits with the
   gospel and the grace of God.

   3. Take heed of carnal affections. Pride, envy, contempt of others, we
   know not how far these lusts may transport us, to what horrid,
   unnatural designs. When once the devil hath a man upon the hip, when
   engaged in an evil design, it is hard to stop; pride then digging pits,
   and then casting off God's law; and then he never cares whether to
   please or displease, honour or dishonour God, is not troubled with such
   kind of thoughts.

   4. Take heed how you engage against God's people, or dig pits for them
   that fear the Lord. God's interest usually goeth along with them: Isa.
   viii. 9, 10, Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken
   to pieces: take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.' As the
   captain's servant said, Take heed what ye do, for this man is a Roman.'
   So these men are children of God, he is their patron and protector; God
   is interested in their protection; they are little ones, but they have
   a great God, Mat. xviii. 10. Therefore take heed of having any interest
   opposite to the strict people of God, for this is but to ruin
   yourselves.

SERMON XCIII.

   For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.--Ver. 89.

   THESE words are usually rendered as making but one proposition; but the
   accent athnah showeth there are two branches, the one asserting the
   eternity of God, the other the constancy and permanency of his word.
   Thus--(1.) For ever art thou, O Lord;' (2.) Thy word is settled in the
   heavens.' So the Syriac version readeth it; and Geierus, and after him
   others, prove and approve this reading. And so this verse and the
   following do the better correspond one with another, if we observe
   beginning and ending, as Thou art for ever, O Lord,' and Thy
   faithfulness unto all generations,' which are exactly parallel. And
   then the last clauses, Thy word is settled in the heavens,' Thou hast
   established the earth, and it abideth.' And implieth, as God is
   eternal, so is his word, and hath an emblem and fit representation both
   in heaven and in earth: in heaven, in the constant motion of the
   heavenly bodies; in earth, in the consistency and permanency thereof;
   that as his word doth stand fast in heaven, so doth his faithfulness on
   earth, where the afflictions of the godly seem to contradict it

   First, Of the first clause, Thou art for ever, O Jehovah.'

   1. That Jehovah is the one, only, eternal, and everlasting God. What
   eternity is passeth our skill exactly to define. As we understand it,
   it is the duration of a being that is without beginning or end.
   Duration is a continual tract of being; and eternal duration implieth
   an immutable and unterminable abode in being. So it is here.

   [1.] It is an infinite, unterminable duration, without beginning or
   ending: Ps. xc. 2, From everlasting to everlasting thou art God.' God
   never was nothing, never shall be nothing. All the generations past
   were, but now are not. We heretofore were not, but now are. God is the
   beginning and end of all things, yet himself without beginning or end.
   He had an infinite, incomprehensible being before any part of the world
   was framed, and will remain the same still when the world shall be no
   more. The soul, in viewing God, is enclosed between infiniteness before
   and infiniteness behind, and which way soever it looketh it seeth
   infiniteness round about it.

   [2.] Immutable; as without beginning and end, so without any change:
   Ps. cii. 25-27, Of old thou hast kid the foundation of the earth, and
   the heavens are the work of thy hands: they shall perish, but thou
   shalt endure, yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a
   vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
   the same, and thy years shall have no end.' God from the mount of
   eternity beholdeth all the successions and changes of the creature; but
   he is not changed, his nature is one and the same from everlasting to
   everlasting. We change every day; we are not that to-day which we were
   yesterday; we have left some part of our life behind us, which is gone,
   and cannot be recovered; and our duration lesseneth every day; but God
   abideth for ever one and the same, though all things be in continual
   flux and motion about him.

   2. Now, that God is eternal I shall prove by scripture and reason.

   [1.] By scripture: Gen. xxi. 33, Abraham called there on the name of
   the Lord, the everlasting God.' The gods of the nations were upstart
   gods, but lately found out and soon destroyed; but he is the eternal
   God, who ever was, and is, and ever will be: Job xxxvi. 26, Behold, God
   is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be
   searched out.' He speaketh of God's eternity in such terms as man is
   capable of; for God's being is not to be measured by days and years,
   but so we express it for our understanding, for his duration is far
   above our reach and capacity. So Isa. lvii. 15, God is said to inhabit
   eternity.' Thus the scripture propounds God's eternity as matter of our
   faith, reverence, and admiration.

   [2.] By reason, because the perfection of the first cause requireth
   that his duration should be without beginning or ending, or, which is
   all one, eternal. He is Jehovah, that hath his being from himself, and
   all other things have their being after him and from him. Some thing
   must be eternal, or else there would be nothing made. It is certain
   that if there had been a time when nothing was, there never would be
   anything, for something cannot come out of nothing; therefore we must
   stop in some first Cause and eternal being.

   3. That eternity belongeth to God is to be seen in all his attributes;
   for if God be eternal, his wisdom, power, and goodness are eternal
   also.

   [1.] His wisdom is eternal, for all things are present to the knowledge
   of God. Things come to our knowledge successively, some before, and
   some after. We see and know things according to their duration and
   existence. We compute by days and years, yesterday, to-morrow, last
   year, and next year. One generation passeth and another cometh, but in
   God's understanding there is no succession of before and after: Known
   to God are all his works from the beginning,' Acts xv. 18. God, that
   doth all things in time, knew them all before time, otherwise his
   knowledge was not infinite and eternal; they are all present to his
   understanding. Hence is that expression: 2 Peter iii. 8, One day is
   with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.'
   All those differences of duration, which to the creatures are longer or
   shorter, are all alike to God; for all things are constantly present to
   God, and under his view and prospect. Indeed the Lord is pleased to
   condescend to our shallow capacities, and to give us leave to express
   his duration in our own terms, whilst he calleth himself Yesterday,
   to-day, and for ever,' Heb. xiii. 8; and Rev. i. 4, From him which is,
   which was, and which is to come.' Yet in proper speaking, God always
   is. I am is his name; and all things to him are present, either past,
   present, or to come. Time hath no succession to him: he beholdeth at
   once what is not at once, but at several times; there is nothing past
   to him, to come to him, but all present. He knoweth the end of all
   things before he giveth them a beginning.

   [2.] His power is eternal; therefore it is said, Rom. i. 20, that his
   eternal power and godhead is clearly understood from the creation of
   the world, and seen in the things that are made. How else could so many
   things be educed out of nothing, and still kept from returning into
   their original nothing, if there were not an infinite and eternal power
   then and still at work? So Isa. xxvi. 4, Trust ye in the Lord for ever,
   for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.' We may depend upon
   him, for his arm is never dried up, nor doth his strength fail; there
   is no wrinkle upon the brow of eternity. God is where he was at first;
   he continueth for ever a God of infinite power, able to save those that
   trust in him.

   [3.] His goodness and mercy are eternal: Ps. cxxxvi., it is often
   repeated, For the mercy of the Lord endureth for ever.' It is true a
   parte ante his mercy did not begin of late, but was towards us before
   we or the world were; from all eternity we were thought upon, that he
   might do us good himself. It is said, With an everlasting love have I
   loved thee, and therefore with loving-kindness I have drawn thee,' Jer.
   xxxi. 3. Whomsoever God draweth to himself in time, he loved them
   before all time. And a parte post it holdeth good; his love and
   affection continueth the same, and shall do for ever; he is not weary
   of doing good, nor is his mercy spent. You have both, Ps. ciii. 17, The
   mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that
   fear him.' The mercy was decreed and prepared before the beginning of
   the world, and we shall have the fruits and effects of it when the
   world shall be no more. It was from everlasting; for God, foreseeing
   the fall of Adam, provided us a remedy in Christ; and having all lapsed
   in his prospect and view, did out of his free love choose some, whilst
   others are passed by, to life and salvation by Christ. That God did
   from eternity decree and purpose this is manifest, because he doth in
   time effect it, otherwise he should not work all things according to
   the counsel of his will,' Eph. i. 11, or else his will would be
   mutable, willing that in time which he willed not from eternity;
   whereas in him there is no variableness or shadow of turning. And that
   his mercy is to everlasting appeareth because he doth in time convert
   and sanctify them, and so bring them to glory and blessedness; for the
   eternal God will make his people eternally happy with himself.

   4. That God showeth himself as an eternal being, both as a governor and
   benefactor.

   [1.] As a governor. His eternity is seen in his government, in
   threatening eternal misery to the wicked, and appointing eternal
   happiness to the godly: Mat. xxv. 46, These shall go away into ever
   lasting punishment, and the righteous into life everlasting.' The joys
   of the blessed are everlasting; there shall never be a change of nor
   interruption in their happiness, but after millions of years they are
   to continue in this life as if it were the first moment. Thy crown will
   be thy crown for ever; thy kingdom thy kingdom for ever; this glory
   will be thy glory for ever; thy God will be thy God, and thy Christ,
   for ever. We affect the continuance of this life, though it be a life
   of pain and misery: Skin for skin, and all a man hath, he will give for
   his life.' Oh, how much more valuable should this eternal life be,
   which is a life of uninterrupted joy and felicity! On the other side,
   the punishment is everlasting, the loss is eternal, the wicked are
   everlastingly deprived of the favour of God. The disciples wept when
   Paul said, Ye shall see my face no more.' Oh, how much more terrible
   will it be to be banished everlastingly out of God's presence! Mat.
   xxv. 41. Besides, the pain will be eternal, as well as the loss. This
   worm never dieth, this fire shall never be quenched, Mark ix. 44.
   Neither heaven nor hell hath any period or end, either of them are
   eternal. Now this way God ruleth and governeth the creature, as
   becoming his infinite and eternal majesty. The laws of kings and
   parliaments can reach no further than some temporal punishment; their
   highest pain is the killing of the body; their highest reward is some
   vanishing and fading honour, or perishing riches; but God's law
   concerneth our everlasting estate, our eternal well or ill-being;
   eternal life or eternal death is wrapped up in these commandments.
   These are rewards suitable to the eternal majesty of the lawgiver; and
   if thou do evil there is an eternal loss of heaven, and an eternal
   sense of the wrath of God. If you believe and obey the gospel there is
   eternal salvation provided for you; for Christ is the author of eternal
   salvation unto all them that obey him,' Heb. v. 9.

   [2.] As a benefactor he showeth himself also an eternal being. There is
   a double beneficial goodness of God--common and special. His common
   goodness runneth in the channel of creation and common providence; his
   special goodness in the channel of redemption and renovation by Christ.

   (1.) He is a benefactor to all men; he hath given them an immortal
   spirit that shall abide for evermore: Eccles. xii. 7, The dust shall
   return to the earth as it was, and the spirit to God that gave it.'
   There is an immortal soul that dwelleth in a mortal body. The body was
   made of corruptible principles, was dust in its composition. It is
   true, God can annihilate it; but the soul, as it is a spirit, hath no
   corruptible principles in it; it is a thing that cannot be killed or
   destroyed by any created power. Now this divine spark, which cannot be
   quenched, is a pledge and effect of God's eternity; for he that giveth
   immortality certainly is immortal himself: nothing can give what it
   hath not. And besides, because our souls are immersed and sunk into
   matter, and forget their divine original, therefore God by the
   blessings of his providence seeks to raise them up to look after this
   supreme and spiritual being, and giveth us all kind of comforts and
   mercies, whose creatures we are, that we may seek the Lord, if haply we
   may feel after him, and find him,' Acts xvii. 27; that we may own him
   as the first cause or father of lights, by whom this spark was kindled
   in us; or seek him as the chief good, in whom alone this rest less soul
   of ours can find contentment and satisfaction.

   (2.) He is a benefactor in a way of grace and recovery by Christ. This
   also sets forth his eternity. The first rise and bottom cause of all
   this grace and favour that stirred and set all the causes on work which
   concurred to it, was God's everlasting love, John iii. 16. And Christ
   saith, Prov. viii. 31, I was set up from everlasting;' and this grace
   was given us in Christ before the world began,' 2 Tim. i. 9. Before the
   foundation of the world was laid this business was transacted with
   Christ for our benefit. And then the way how it was brought about, it
   was by an everlasting redemption, Heb. ix. 12, of an eternal force,
   value, and efficacy. And the grace wrought in us; it is called
   incorruptible seed,' 1 Peter i. 23. There is an eternal principle in
   our hearts, and that is the reason why a believer is so often said to
   have eternal life abiding in him, because of the beginning, seed, and
   principle of it that is sown in his heart; and the comfort and fruit of
   it that we have here is called everlasting consolation,' 2 Thes. ii.
   16, He hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good
   hope, through grace.' It is not bottomed on any poor fading thing, but
   on matters of an eternal duration; the happiness itself is the eternal
   fruition of the ever-blessed God: 1 Thes. iv. 17, We shall be ever with
   the Lord.' So that we are made eternal also both in body and soul;
   whence you see how abundantly God discovereth his eternal being, in all
   his gifts and graces by Christ.

   5. When the creatures are spoken of as eternal, it must be understood;
   it is a communicated, dependent, half eternity, and so no derogation to
   this perfection which is proper to God.

   [1.] It is communicated to us, for originally God only hath
   immortality, 1 Tim. vi. 16. We have it by derivation, God hath it
   originally in himself and from himself. God dispenseth and measureth
   out the duration and continuance of all other things, their races and
   stages, when they shall begin and when they shall end. And that
   immortality which the angels and the souls of men have is ascribed to
   us by participation; we have it from God, because he was pleased to
   give it to us.

   [2.] It is a dependent eternity, for every moment we depend upon God;
   if he take away his Spirit we are gone, man or angel. We assert the
   immortality of the soul because it hath not the principles of
   corruption in it as the body hath; but yet we cannot, must not cut off
   the dependence upon the first cause and fountain of being. In his hand
   is the breath of all living, and he is often called the God of your
   life,' and the God of the spirits of all flesh.'

   [3.] It is but a half eternity: we sometimes were not, God is from
   everlasting to everlasting; but we are appointed to eternal life, and
   time was when we lay in the womb of nothing. We are but of yesterday,
   poor upstarts, that had but an existence and a new being given us of
   God; if he will lengthen it out, and continue it to all eternity, it is
   not such an eternity as he hath, but a half eternity; not an eternity
   without beginning, but only without ending.

   6. This eternity of God is not seriously and sufficiently enough
   thought of and improved, till it lessen all other things in our opinion
   and estimation of them and affection to them. Two things should
   especially be lessened--the time we spend in the world, and the things
   that we enjoy in the world.

   [1.] The time we spend in the world. Alas! what is this to God's
   eternity! Ps. xxxix. 5, Behold, thou hast made my days as an
   handbreadth, and mine age is nothing before thee.' Whether our days be
   spent in prosperity or adversity they are but short, a hand-breadth, a
   mere nothing, compared with God's eternity: Ps. ex. 4, A thousand years
   in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the
   night.' A thousand years, compared to eternity, are but as a drop spilt
   and left in the ocean, or as time insensibly past over in sleep. Forty,
   fifty, or seventy years seemeth a great time with us; yet with God, who
   is infinite, ten thousand years is no considerable space, but a very
   short and small duration.

   [2.] As time, so the things of the world: 2 Cor. iv. 18, The things
   which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
   eternal.' They are short as to continuance and use. As to continuance,
   he calleth the honours and delight of Pharaoh's court, Heb. xi. 25, The
   pleasures of sin for a season.' Whatsoever is temporal a man may see
   the end of it. Be it evil: a man in the deep waters is not discouraged
   as long as he can see banks; but in eternity there are neither banks
   nor bottom. If good: Ps. cxix. 96, I have seen an end of all
   perfection.' The most shining glory will shortly be burnt out to a
   snuff; it wastes every day. Eternity maketh good things infinitely
   good, and evil things infinitely evil. If it be temporal, whatever
   paineth us is but a flea-bite to eternal torments. Whatever pleaseth or
   delights, it is but a may-game to eternal joys. So for use too, it is
   but for a season, Deut. xxiii. 24; the law gave an indulgence to eat of
   his neighbours' grapes for refreshment; But thou shalt not put any in
   thy vessel:' 1 Tim. vi. 7, For we brought nothing into this world, and
   it is certain we can carry nothing out.' The manna was useful and
   refreshing when used in the day, but if kept all night it perished and
   was useless; it was useful in the wilderness, but ceased when they came
   to Canaan.

   The uses are many.

   Use 1. First, Comfort to the godly, for their own particular. He is an
   eternal God that ordereth and guideth all things, that he may bring
   them to their eternal felicity, and will in time admit them into it:
   Ps. xlviii. 14, For this God is our God for ever and ever, and he will
   be our guide even unto death.' After death he will be their God still;
   death doth not put an end to this relation; for God is Abraham's God
   when he is dead, Mat. xxii. 32. God is the same still, both in himself
   and to those that believe in him: he will constantly guide them all the
   days of their life, and after death receive us to the ever lasting
   enjoyment of himself, and revive our dust. Oh, what a blessedness is
   this, to have an interest in such an eternal God! Secondly, As to the
   community and society to which they do belong. God's eternity is the
   church's stability; and so it is urged in scripture: Mal. iii. 6, For I
   am the Lord; I change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
   consumed;' Ps. cii. 27, 28, Thou art the same, and thy years shall have
   no end; the children of thy servants shall continue.' So when the
   flourishing of the wicked is spoken of, when they spring as grass: Ps.
   xcii. 8, But thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.' If they be
   high, God is higher, and they are but upstarts to him; their power is
   of a late rise and short continuance. So Ps. xciii. 2, Thy throne is
   established of old; thou art from everlasting.' God's throne is as
   eternal as his being. So Lam. iii. 17, Thou, O Lord, remainest for
   ever, and thy throne from generation to generation.' Is the life of thy
   enemies long? God endureth for ever. Is their power great? It is but
   dependent. God had power before them, and will have power when they
   shall be no more.

   Use 2. Terror to the wicked: Heb. x. 31, It is a fearful thing to fall
   into the hands of the living God.' They may outlive other enemies, but
   they cannot outlive God, who abideth for ever, to avenge his quarrel
   against them. And judge you if his controversy against them be not
   just, since they are such impious fools and brutes as that they prefer
   the creature before the creator, and choose temporal things rather than
   everlasting, and prefer earth before heaven, and the satisfaction of
   their bodily lusts before the saving of their souls. Can you blame God
   of any injustice in dooming them to everlasting misery? What part of
   the punishment would you have relaxed? the loss, or the pain? The loss
   is double--of God's favour or their natural comforts. Would you have
   God admit those to the sight and everlasting fruition of him self who
   never cared for him? Or return again to their natural comforts, that
   they may eternally run riot with them, or abuse them to an occasion of
   the flesh? Or is it the pain? Would you have God take off that when the
   sin and impenitent obstinacy doth still continue, since they preferred
   a temporal good before that which is eternal, and would sell their
   birthright for one morsel of meat'? Heb. xii. 16. How just is it for
   God to make them everlastingly to lie under the fruits and effects of
   their own evil choice!

   Use 3. To press us to seek after the everlasting fruition of this
   blessed and ever-glorious God, because many live as if they had never
   heard of things eternal; most live as if they did not believe any such
   thing; the best do not improve those things as they ought: therefore I
   shall a little insist upon a quickening exhortation, to stir you up to
   seek an eternal happiness in God.

   1. As we are reasonable creatures, we were made for eternity; for God
   hath given us an immortal spirit, and there is no proportion between an
   immortal soul and temporal things. It cannot be content with anything
   that shall have an end, for then we may survive our happiness. If we
   had souls that would perish, it would be more excusable to look after
   things that perish. What will you do when your souls shall be turned
   out of doors, when ye fail? Luke xvi. 9. To what region will the poor,
   shiftless, harbourless soul betake itself when you die? All your
   thoughts that concern the present world perish; and if you did perish
   too, it were no such great matter. But you shall live; and what will
   you have to comfort yourselves if you have not an interest in the
   eternal God? In whose hands will you be if you have slighted him while
   you were upon earth, and the eternal happiness he offereth to us, and
   could not find enough in God and his eternal salvation to take off your
   hearts from the pleasures and vanities of the world? Can you expect
   that he will favour you and be kind to you?

   2. Eternity is made known to us Christians, and clearly set before us
   in the doctrine of the gospel: 2 Tim. i. 10, He hath brought life and
   immortality to light through the gospel.' Nature hath but guesses at
   it, the law but shadows; but here it is clearly, certainly, and fully
   revealed. You know that you have an eternal God to please, and an
   infinite and eternal reward to expect. The whole drift of our religion
   is to call us off from time to eternity, from this world to a better.
   Christ came not to settle us here in a state of prosperity, nor to make
   this world our rest and portion, but to draw us up to God and heaven.

   3. The same religion showeth that we are already involved in an eternal
   misery, and stand under a sentence binding us over to the curse and
   everlasting wrath of God: John iii. 18, He that believeth not is
   condemned already: and this is the condemnation, that light is come
   into the world, and men love darkness more than light, because their
   deeds are evil.' God hath offered life and immortality to them who have
   so miserably lost it, and involved their souls in eternal death.
   Therefore, if we know what it is to be liable to the wrath of an
   eternal God, and to be interested in the hopes of eternal glory, we
   should awaken and be more serious in a business of such concernment.

   4. You will shortly be summoned to give an account, Luke xvi. 2. You
   have received so much from me, such riches, honours, parts,
   sufficiencies, such invitations to draw you home to me, what will you
   answer? Nay; there is not only a little time between you and judgment,
   but a little time between you and execution; nothing but the slender
   thread of a frail life, which is soon fretted asunder. And will you,
   can you sleep in sin so near eternity, and laugh and dance over the
   brink of hell? You cannot soon enough flee from wrath to come.

   5. Consider what poor deluded wretches, who are in that everlasting
   estate, would give, if they might be trusted with a little time again,
   that they might provide for eternity. How happy would they think
   themselves if God would but try them once more! If careless creatures
   would but anticipate the thoughts of another world, how soon would they
   discern their mistake! How miserably will you bewail yourselves when
   you have lost eternity for poor temporal trifles! What comfort will it
   be to you that you have been merry here, lived in pomp and ease, when
   you must endure the wrath of God for evermore, and wish for any allay
   of your torments? Luke xvi. 24, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
   send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool
   my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.' It is better to believe
   than try; provide against it, than try.

   6. If you be Christians indeed, you have not the spirit of this world.
   Christianity, as it is acted by us, is but the exercise of faith, hope,
   and love. Now, the eternal fruition of God is the matter that all these
   graces are conversant about. Faith believeth that there is an eternal
   being, and that our happiness lieth in the fruition of him, Heb. xi. 6.
   Love is that which levelleth and directeth all our actions to this
   blessed end, that we may see God and enjoy him as our portion and
   felicity: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is
   none upon earth I desire beside thee.' Our desires are after him, our
   delights in him; it is our work to please him, our happiness to enjoy
   him. The truth of his eternal being is the object of our faith; so the
   apprehension of him as our chief good and felicity is the object of our
   love, so as he is capable of being enjoyed; and our participated
   eternity is the object of our faith: this is the end of all our desires
   and labours, and the expectation of this fortifieth us against all the
   difficulties of our pilgrimage, and so directeth us what to mind, be,
   and do: 2 Cor. v. 9, Therefore we labour, that, whether present or
   absent, we may be accepted of the Lord.'

   Directions what we shall do.

   Direct. 1. Meditate often and seriously of eternity. There is a great
   deal of profit gotten by this meditation; nothing doth more promote the
   great ends of the gospel than this meditation.

   1. For Christ. Nothing makes Christ precious but serious thoughts of
   eternity, he being the only means to deliver us from wrath to come,
   which is the great evil of the other state, and procure for us the
   eternal enjoyment of God, which is the good of that estate: Ps. lxxxiv.
   11, He is a sun and a shield, and no good thing will he withhold from
   them that live uprightly.' You can make a shift without Christ in this
   world, you are by ordinary means well provided against the evils of
   this life, and well fortified with the good things thereof; but in
   death, Christ will be to thee gain and advantage.

   2. It would promote the great change. What will make a proud man
   humble, a vain man serious, a covetous worldling heavenly, a wicked man
   a good man? Let him think of eternity, where only the humble, the
   heavenly, are favoured and accepted, 2 Cor. iii. 11.

   3. What would check temptations, either from the pleasures, riches, or
   honours of the world? These are not eternal riches, nor eternal
   pleasures, nor eternal honours; transitory things are not our business,
   nor our scope, Heb. xi. 25.

   4. What would quicken diligence, and put life into our endeavours but
   the meditation of eternity? Everything should be laboured for that hath
   an everlastingness in it; the travail of your souls should be laid out
   upon those things: Isa. lv. 2, Wherefore do you spend your money for
   that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfies not?'
   So John vi. 27, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but that which
   endureth to life everlasting.' Surely serious diligence is necessary.
   Shall I trifle away that time which I am to improve for eternity?

   Direct. 2. Let the enjoyment of an eternal God be your end and scope: 2
   Cor. iv. 18, While we look not to things which are seen, but to things
   that are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the
   things which are not seen are eternal.' When you have set eternal
   things before you, then make your choice. On the one side there are
   eternal joys, on the other eternal torments. Now vain pleasures lead to
   the one, solid godliness to the other. By the neglect of God you run
   the hazard of a miserable eternity. By the choice of God for your Lord
   and portion, you get an interest in a blessed eternity: only let me
   warn you--

   1. To choose end and means together: Mat. vii. 13, 14, Enter ye in at
   the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth
   to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat. Because strait is
   the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be
   that find it.' They must be coupled; both quicken each other, the
   intention of the end quickens to a diligent pursuit and an earnest use
   of means; and the use of means will sooner give you to understand what
   your condition will be than a bare reflection upon the end.

   2. Do not confound principal and subordinate means, so as one should
   jostle out the other. The primary means of going to the Father is
   Christ: John xiv. 6, Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth,
   and the life: no man cometh to the Father but by me.' The secondary
   means is holiness: Heb. xii. 14, Without holiness no man shall see the
   Lord.'

   Direct. 3. Be resolvedly true to your end, which is the enjoyment of
   God, and that will quicken you the more, and direct you; for the end is
   both our measure and our motive. In short, do all things from eternal
   principles to eternal ends. The eternal principle is the grace of the
   Spirit; the eternal end is the pleasing, glorifying, and enjoying of
   God: Phil. i. 11, Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which
   are by Jesus Christ unto the praise and glory of God.' Actions carried
   on from eternal principles, according to an eternal rule, for an
   eternal end, cannot miscarry.

SERMON XCIV.

   Thy word is settled in heaven.--Ver. 89.

   THIS will bear two senses--(1.) Relating to God's decree, made in
   heaven; (2.) An emblem of its constancy, is in heaven.

   1. It may be referred to God's decree, Thy word is settled in heaven,'
   in thy mind and will. The words of temporal kings are on earth, and
   therefore their laws and edicts are subject to many changes, and are
   often revoked and altered, either by themselves or by their successors;
   but the word of God is above all changes and alterations, as being
   decreed in heaven. It is preached on earth, believed on earth,
   fulfilled on earth; but decreed in heaven, fixed and settled there by
   God's unalterable purpose and will.

   2. That in heaven there is an emblem of it. It is usual in scripture to
   set forth the stability and constancy of God's word by this similitude;
   as Ps. lxxxix. 2, Mercy shall be built up for ever, thy faithfulness
   hast thou established in the very heavens.' So when it is compared with
   the covenant of day and night: Jer. xxxiii. 20, 21, Thus saith the
   Lord, If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the
   night, that there should not be day and night in their seasons; then
   may also my covenant be broken with David my servant.' So Jer. xxxi.
   35-37. This sense I incline to, because in the next verse it is
   compared with the stability of the earth. Well, then, his word is
   settled in heaven, partly because the heavens stand fast by the same
   word by which they were first made: Gen. i. 3, 6, And God said, Let
   there be light, and there was light; Let there be a firmament in the
   midst of the waters, and divide the waters from the waters; and it was
   so.' So Midrash Tillim. And partly because the being and order of
   heaven showeth the settledness of God's word, as the heavens were
   created and settled in a course, which they constantly observe in their
   motions; and this duration and equability in the motion is so exact,
   that men can foresee eclipses long before they happen; therefore the
   Psalmist saith, Ps. cxiv. 19, The sun knoweth his going down;' that is,
   keepeth so to the just points of his compass as if he were an
   intelligent agent, and knew the exact time when to set and rise. Now
   when we lift up our eyes to heaven, and see how punctually and exactly
   the order is observed which was once settled by God's will; even from
   the beginning of the world to this day no remarkable change hath been
   observed; the heavenly bodies keep their tenor and course, and by their
   constant motions distribute their light and influence to the world, and
   this from their first creation, and all because he hath said, It shall
   be so; in the strength of his word they abide. This continuance of the
   heavens showeth the permanency of his word.

   Doct. That God's word is of an eternal truth and immutable constancy.

   By his word is principally meant the gospel covenant. It is said by the
   prophet Isaiah, chap xl. 8, The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth,
   but the word of our God shall stand for ever.' And the apostle Peter,
   quoting and improving the same place, saith, The word of God is the
   gospel preached unto you,' 1 Peter i. 24, 25. And more especially the
   promise of eternal life; for that is opposite to the fading glory of
   the present life, and is the eternal effect of the word of God abiding
   in our hearts. When all other things fade and decay, this blessed
   estate, offered in and conveyed by the gospel, will not fail us.

   1. I shall give you the reasons.

   2. The emblem and representation.

   3. The profit and usefulness of this meditation.

   First, The reasons. In every promise, that it be certain and firm,
   three things are required:--

   1. That it may be made seriously and heartily, with a purpose to
   perform it.

   2. That he that hath promised continue in his purpose without change of
   mind.

   3. That it be in the power of him that promiseth to perform what he
   hath so promised. Now of all these things there can be no doubt

   [1.] Certainly God meaneth as he speaketh, when he promiseth to give
   eternal life to those that believe and obey the gospel. There is no
   question but he is so minded, when he hath written a book to assure the
   world of it; for what need God to court the creature with an imaginary
   happiness, or to tell them of a glorious estate which he never meant to
   bestow upon them? Yea, why should Amen, the faithful witness, come from
   heaven further to assure us of it by his doctrine, die the death to
   purchase it for us, and afterward rise again, and enter into that
   happiness which he spake of, That our faith and hope may be in God?' 1
   Peter i. 21. Why should he, as soon as he was ascended, give gifts unto
   men, send forth messengers into the world to preach this doctrine, and
   give notice, of this blessed estate to he had on these terms, and
   attest it by divers signs and wonders, partly to alarm the drowsy world
   to regard it, and assure the incredulous world of the truth of this
   salvation? Heb. ii. 3, 4. Not to believe that God is serious in all
   this, is to make him a liar indeed, yea, to establish a lie and
   falsehood with great solemnity.

   [2.] That God doth continue his purpose is beyond doubt, if we consider
   his eternal and unchangeable nature: Mal. iii. 6, For I am the Lord; I
   change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed:' and James i.
   17, With him is neither variableness nor show of turning.' And what
   should alter his purpose? Doth he meet with anything that he foresaw
   not, and knew not before? God doth never repent, and call back his
   grant, that he hath by this act of grace insured eternal happiness to
   the saints on such terms: 1 Sam. xv. 29, For the strength of Israel
   will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent;'
   Ps. ex. 4, I have sworn, and will not repent: thou art a priest for
   ever, after the order of Melchisedeck.' Christ is instated in full
   power of entertaining and blessing his faithful servants, which shall
   never be retracted. To take off all doubt, he hath given us double
   assurance--his word and his oath: Heb. vi. 17, 18, God being willing
   more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his
   counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, wherein
   ii was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation who
   have fled for refuge,' &c. God hath ever been tender of his word; above
   all that is famed or believed of God, this is most conspicuous: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 2, Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.' Now this
   needed not, for an oath is interposed in a doubtful matter; but it
   showeth God's extra ordinary care for our satisfaction; his good-will
   is seen in the promise, his solicitude in the oath. In short, God would
   never be so fast bound, but that he doth continue his purpose.

   [3.] That he is able to perform it: Mat. xix. 26, With God all things
   are possible;' Rom. iv. 21, Being fully persuaded that what God had
   promised he was able to perform:' Phil. iii. 21, According to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.' He is
   able to find out a way whereby sinners may be reconciled, sanctified,
   subdued by his Spirit; whereby his interests may be preserved in them
   against the assaults of the devil, the world, and the flesh; finally,
   able to raise our bodies after eaten out by worms and turned into dust.
   Matters of faith being chiefly or mainly future and to come, and
   difficult to be performed, therefore an express belief of God's power
   is necessary. To convert such an obstinate, and to sanctify such a
   sinful creature, and to raise the dead, are no slight things.

   Secondly, The emblem of this immutable constancy is settled in the
   heavens; it is not measured by the floating estate of things here upon
   earth, but by the perfection of the heavens, which are free from all
   changes and chances.

   1. They are fit emblems of the stability of the word, for they continue
   to be what his word once made them to be. There is no jostling among
   the stars, but all obey God's word and law: Ps. cxlviii. 4-6, Praise
   him, ye heavens of heavens, and waters that be above the heavens: let
   them praise the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were
   created: he hath also established them for ever and ever; he hath made
   a decree which shall not pass.' So that when a believer looketh up to
   heaven, there he seeth the book of the creatures opened, wherein he
   beholdeth God's constancy and certainty written in indelible
   characters. God's powerful voice did first separate the waters from the
   waters, and those celestial bodies move in that order wherein God hath
   set them. Now is not this a help to us, when we open the book of
   scriptures, and compare the one with the other, how the stated course
   of nature, and the stated course of grace, agree with his power? For as
   long as you trust God's word you can never fail, for both heaven and
   earth are sustained by it: Heb. i. 3, He upholdeth all things by the
   word of his power.' All is easy to God, for he preserveth the heavens
   in that estate wherein they are governed, and can preserve his people
   in the most difficult cases.

   2. God's constancy and truth doth appear in the heavens also; there is
   a witness there of his eternal truth; for when he had once said, Let
   there be heavens,' &c., they presently were, and ever since have kept
   one constant tenor and course. Yea, heaven shall sooner fail than God's
   word fail; he will not retract what he hath once said; and therefore
   his word is more firm and stable than the frame of heaven and earth:
   Mat. v. 18, Till heaven and earth pass, not one jot or tittle shall
   pass from the law till all be fulfilled;' Mat. xxiv. 35, Heaven and
   earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.' So that God's
   word is more stable than heaven and earth.

   Thirdly, The profit of this meditation.

   1. That we may set the sureness of this word against the diffidence and
   distrustfulness of our own hearts: Luke xxiv. 25, Slow of heart to
   believe.' Though God hath so firmly bound himself to the creature by
   his own word, yet the promise to us seemeth doubtful and uncertain,
   especially when men are clouded with troubles and temptations; for we
   look only to present sense, and would not be put on any trial. Now it
   is comfortable to remember that the order and course of nature is not
   so settled as the grace of the covenant is: let it have its course,
   resolved and patient obedience will at length end in eternal happiness;
   and therefore we should build surely upon a firm foundation, that we
   may not stagger through unbelief, but give glory to God,' Rom. iv. 20.

   2. To comfort us when our hopes are delayed. In due time the promise
   cannot want the effect, Heb. vi. 12. There will be day and night,
   summer and winter, in their season; therefore as in the night we wait
   for day, and in the winter for summer, so must we wait for our eternal
   consolation.

   3. To support us against the various changes in the state of worldly
   things. Many things fall out in this world that breed trouble in us,
   therefore if we should only look to the present state of things, our
   hearts would float up and down; but we must look to the immutable
   constancy of God's word, that is a sure rock for the anchor of hope to
   take hold on. There is a sure rule to walk by, sure promises to build
   upon, if we would be everlastingly happy. There are the sure mercies of
   David,' Isa. lv. 3. The changes of this world perplex our faith;
   therefore we should not look to the instability of things below,
   wherein there are continual vicissitudes, but to the sure covenant.

   4. Not only when our hopes are delayed and obscured by the changes and
   chances of this world, but contradicted by contrary appearances; God
   seemeth to cast us off, to have no pleasure in us. Now to bear up our
   faith in the hardest condition, that we may say, Job xiii. 15, Though
   he slay me, yet will I trust in him,' and believe in hope against hope,
   we should remember the settledness and constancy of his word. The
   promises stand firm in heaven, when they seem to fail on earth. God may
   cover himself with frowns, and his dispensations may seem contrary to
   his intention; as Joseph spake roughly to his brethren, when he meant
   to discover himself to them, or as Christ dealt with the woman of
   Canaan, Mat. xv. But when there seemeth to be such a contradiction
   between the word and works of God, when his voice is sweet like
   Jacob's, and his hand rough like Esau's, we must remember that the
   smart rod is consistent with covenant love, Ps. lxxxix. 32. And we must
   not interpret the promise of God by his providential dealing with us,
   but rather his dealing by his promises; his promise being as the light
   part of the cloud, and his dealing as the dark part of it. God is
   fulfilling promises by hard dispensations, and sharp afflictions belong
   to his faithfulness, Ps. cxix. 75. Many times that is best for us, not
   what we think best, but what God thinks best. The buffetings of Satan
   and oppositions of the world may be most wholesome to us, though not
   most pleasing to the flesh.

   5. To wean us from the fading vanities of the world, Isa. xl. 8, and 1
   Peter i. 24. There is nothing firm and lasting in this world till we
   lift up our eyes to heaven, and seek an happiness in the promises, 1
   John ii. 17. Our happiness lieth not in the present life, but in the
   everlasting enjoyment of God: in the covenant all is settled and sure,
   but in the world all is unstable and uncertain. God's covenant
   provideth for us eternal joy and bliss.

   Use 1. To show what contrary and different conclusions the carnal and
   spiritual will draw from the same principles. The scoffers said, 2
   Peter iii. 4, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
   fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
   creation.' Because the whole frame of nature had kept one constant
   tenour and course, they plead for the eternity of the world and the
   falsehood of the promises. Now David reasoneth quite the contrary way.
   They see the mercy of God, that the things of nature keep ordinarily
   one constant course, and are not terrified with the frequent change
   thereof; yea, they are thereby confirmed in the belief of the Lord's
   constancy and faithfulness. But men in love with their lusts make a
   woful use of this consideration, hardening themselves in their conceit,
   that there shall never be a change, and so sin more securely. See the
   like in other things: 1 Cor. vii. 29; 1 Cor. xv. 32; Jude 24; Rom. vi.
   2; 2 Sam. vii. 2; with Hag. i. 2; 1 Sam. iii. 18; 2 Kings vi. 33.

   Use 2. Whenever you look to heaven, remember that within you have a God
   who hath fixed his residence and shown his glory there, and made it the
   seat both of his mercy and justice. You have also there a Saviour, who,
   after he had died for our sins, sat down at the right hand of majesty,
   to see his promises accomplished, and by his word to subdue the whole
   world. There are angels that fulfil his commandment, hearkening to the
   voice of his word,' Ps. ciii. 21. There are glorified saints, who see
   God face to face, and dwell with him for evermore, and came thither by
   the same covenant which is propounded to us as the charter of our peace
   and hope. Without, we see the sun and moon and all the heavenly bodies
   move in that fixed course and order wherein God hath set them; and will
   God show his constancy in the course of nature, and be fickle and
   changeable in the covenant of grace, wherein he hath disposed the order
   and method of his mercies?

   Use 3. To cure our unbelief, by considering how God's grace is settled
   in the covenant, so as to leave no cause or occasion of doubting or
   suspecting the truth and certainty of those blessings which he hath
   promised us; and shall we live in jealousy, as if we were not upon such
   sure terms with God? If we transact with another about certain
   benefits, the transaction may prove to no purpose, if the matter about
   which we contract with them hath no being, or the terms be impossible,
   or the conveyance be not firm and strong, so as to hold good in law.
   Now, none of these can be imagined in our entering into covenant with
   God. For--

   1. Eternal life is not a chimera, or a thing that hath no being. You
   might run uncertainly, 1 Cor. ix. 24, if it were a dream or a
   well-devised fable. No; it is the greatest reality in the world, Heb.
   iv. 9, we cannot be mistaken; we see it before us in the promises so
   confirmed.

   2. It is not upon impossible terms, but such as are performable by the
   grace of God: Eph. ii. 8, By grace ye are saved through faith, and that
   not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.' And the apostle telleth us,
   Rom. iv. 16, It is of grace, that it may be sure to all the seed.' It
   is grace maketh it sure. God giveth what he requireth. There are
   conditions that concern making covenant and keeping covenant. First,
   conditions for making covenant: Jer. xxiv. 7, I will give them an heart
   to know me, that I am the Lord;' Ezek. xxxvi. 26, A new heart will I
   give you, and a new spirit will I bestow upon you.' After this, for
   keeping covenant: This is a covenant that keepeth us as well as we keep
   it: Jer. xxxii. 40, 41, I will put my fear into their hearts, that they
   shall not depart from me;' so Ezek. xxxvi. 27, there is a promise of
   influence, I will put my spirit into you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.' This to prevent
   the danger of discovenanting.

   3. Or that the conveyance be not strong and firm, so as to make n plea
   in law; for it is as strongly confirmed as anything can be by God's
   word and oath, as before it is upon record in heaven among the ancient
   decrees of God. It is written in the word for our comfort; yea, upon
   our hearts. It is sealed by the blood of Christ, Heb. ix. 16, 17;
   sealed by the Spirit, Eph. i. 13. And therefore the conveyance will
   bear a plea, both now in prayer, and hereafter before the tribunal of
   God. We may show him his promises, plead the satisfaction of Christ, as
   he pleadeth it in heaven, Heb. ix. 24. But where is there room for any
   doubt? If any, it must be of your qualification; for on God's part all
   is ordered and sure; and there two things: First, That all the
   qualifications of the gospel must be evangelically interpreted, not
   legally; not in absolute perfection, but prevalent degree, Mark ix. 29,
   and Can. v. 2. Secondly, Your only way to obtain comfort is to make the
   qualification more explicit: 1 John ii. 5, Whosoever keepeth his word,
   in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby we know that we are
   in him;' and 1 John iii. 19, Hereby we know that we are of the truth.'

   4. Let nothing that is uncertain keep you from this blessed and sure
   covenant. All things without it are uncertain. Riches are uncertain, 1
   Tim. vi. 17. The like may be said of honours, they are slippery places;
   of friends, health, life itself. Now, do not forsake your own mercies
   for lying vanities. Some vain thing or other taketh us off from God and
   seeking his favour, which will certainly prove a lie to you; therefore
   employ your time, care, and thoughts about these things.

   5. If the covenant be settled, never expect to alter it, or model it,
   and bring it down to your fancies and humours. It is God only that can
   prescribe conditions and laws of commerce between us and him; man is
   not allowed to prescribe the conditions, or treat about the making of
   them, but is only bound to submit to what God was pleased to prescribe,
   and to fulfil the conditions without disputing. They are not left free
   and indifferent for us to debate them, and modify, and mitigate, and
   bring them down to our own liking and humour. We are to take hold, not
   to appoint, Isa. lvi. 4, and Rom. x. 3; so that it bindeth our duty as
   well as assureth our comfort. Our vote cometh too late to retract and
   alter God's eternal decrees. What would you have to be done for your
   freedom from hell and the wrath of God? Oh, that God would alter those
   severe constitutions which he hath made, and not insist so strictly on
   the self-denying duties required in the gospel covenant for the
   salvation of sinners! You may as well ask that God should repeal the
   ordinances of nature, turn night into day, and day into night for your
   sakes. But if the gospel covenant were repealed, that you may be more
   secure, what then? In what a case are you then? What will you hold by
   then? You have no hope if the gospel stand in force; but what hope
   would you have if the gospel were abolished? Must the whole world be
   ruined to establish your security and indulgence to sin? Oh! surely
   this gospel thus stated hath more stability than the foundations of
   heaven and earth. Therefore, expect nothing to be altered for thy sake.
   The gospel constitution was settled long before thou wert born, and it
   is an unalterable decree, which cannot be reversed. All this is spoken
   to confute them that look upon the gospel as true and to be believed,
   till they meet with something which crosses them, and then they hope it
   is not so. In short, God is true when he promises, true when he
   threatens, true when he commandeth. Or thus, if the gospel covenant be
   false, thou has no ground of hope; if true, it doometh licentious
   sinners to eternal destruction.

SERMON XCV.

   Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the
   earth, and it abideth.--Ver. 90.

   THESE words contain a truth which is--(1.) Asserted; (2.) Represented
   by a fit and lively emblem, thou hast established the earth, and it
   abideth. He had before said, Thy word is settled in the heavens:' now
   he speaketh of it as manifested in the earth. There the constancy of
   God's promises was set forth by the duration and equal motion of the
   heavenly bodies, now by the firmness and immovableness of the earth.
   God's powerful word and providence reacheth to the whole world, this
   lower part here upon earth, as well as the upper part in heaven.

   Doct. That in all ages God ever showed himself a true God, and faithful
   in all his promises. It is here confirmed by experience, and
   represented by an emblem.

   1. God's faithfulness relateth to some promise wherein he hath engaged
   himself to his people: Heb. xi. 11, She judged him faithful who had
   promised.' It is his mercy to make promises, but it is his faithfulness
   and truth to fulfil them. His truth is pawned with the creature till he
   discharge it, Micah vii. 20.

   2. His truth dependeth upon his unchangeable nature, but it is
   confirmed to us by experience. His unchangeable nature, Heb. vi. 18. If
   a promise can be made out to be of God, we have no more reason to doubt
   of it than of the nature and being of God. Yet, quoad nos, it is
   confirmed by experience: Ps. xviii. 30, The word of the Lord is a tried
   word.' We are led by sensible things, and what hath been done doth
   assure us of what shall be done, or may be expected from God.

   3. That therefore God hath been ever tender of his truth, that the
   event may answer the promise, and we might know that God that hath been
   faithful, and kept touch with the world hitherto, will not fail at
   last. The heathens ascribed a double perfection to their gods--
   aletheu'ein kai` eurgetein. So the true God is known by his mercy and
   his fidelity; he never failed to perform his part of the covenant with
   any: Ps. cxxxviii. 2, 1 will praise thy name, for thy lovingkindness
   and thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.' As
   he hath made us admirable and great promises of giving his Son, and
   with him all things, so he will certainly perform all to the utmost
   importance of them. The matter of his word is mercy and
   loving-kindness, and in the performance thereof there is great truth
   and fidelity; as he hath made great and excellent promises, so he
   performeth them most punctually. So that in fulfilling his word, God
   will be known above all that is named, or famed, or believed, or
   apprehended, and spoken of them. Here is his great glory and
   excellency.

   4. That the experience of all generations doth confirm God's
   faithfulness in his promises; for it is said in the text, His
   faithfulness is unto all generations.' In the Hebrew it is, From
   generation to generation.'

   The point may be amplified by two considerations:--

   First, That some promises have been received by one generation, and
   fulfilled in another.

   Secondly, That the same common promises have been fulfilled to the
   faithful in all ages.

   First, That some promises have been received by one generation, and
   fulfilled in another, when the matter so required; as, for instance,
   Israel's going out of Egypt: Gen. xv. 13, 14, And he said unto Abraham,
   Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is
   not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four
   hundred years: and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge;
   and afterwards they shall come out with great substance.' Compare now
   Exod. xii. 41, and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and
   thirty years, even the self-same day it came to pass, that all the
   hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.' Thirty years were
   added, because of their fathers dwelling in Canaan; but God kept touch
   to a day. So for the promise of the Messiah and calling the Gentiles;
   that God fulfilled in due time, and sent a Saviour into the world: Gal.
   iv. 4, In the fulness of time God sent his son.' When the sceptre was
   gone from Judah, Gen. xlix. 10, when the crown was possessed by Herod,
   a tributary and foreigner, during the Roman monarchy, which at length
   Christ should utterly destroy. Dan. ii. 35, Nebuchadnezzar had a vision
   of an image of four different metals, the head of gold, arms and
   breasts silver, belly and thighs brass, and the feet part iron and
   clay. While he beheld the image, and surveyed it from head to foot, he
   saw a stone hewn out of the mountain without hands, which stone smote
   the image, not upon the head, breast, or belly, but upon the feet of
   iron and clay, upon which it vanished away, and the stone became a
   great mountain, and filled the whole earth. This vision Daniel
   expounded of four Gentile kingdoms, which should succeed one another
   with great extent of dominion. The first of the Babylonians, which then
   was; the second of the Medes and Persians; the third of the Grecians;
   the fourth of the Romans, which subdued all the others, and because
   possessed of the riches and glory of the former; during this last
   kingdom was the stone hewn out of the mountain, and smote the iron
   feet. This stone was the kingdom of the God of heaven, which Christ set
   up. But not to trouble you with mysteries and nice debates, the apostle
   telleth us, Rom. xv. 8-10, That Jesus Christ was a minister of the
   circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the
   fathers: and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
   is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles,
   and sing unto thy name. And again, it is said, Rejoice, ye Gentiles.'
   The event in all these cases afterwards did speak for itself; so in all
   that is yet to come, we should depend upon the veracity of God; as the
   calling of the Jews, the destruction of antichrist, a more ample
   effusion of gifts on the church, together with a dilation of its
   borders; as the patriarchs all died in faith:' Heb. xi. 13, Having not
   received the promises, but having seen them afar off, were persuaded of
   them, and embraced them.'

   Secondly, That the same common promises have been fulfilled to the
   faithful in all ages; there is but one and the same way to eternal life
   in necessary things, and the dispensations of God to every age are
   still the same; and so in every generation the promises of God are
   still fulfilled as if they were directed to that time only. God's
   faithfulness hath been tried many ways and at many times, but every age
   furnisheth examples of the truth of his promises. From the beginning of
   the world to the end, God is ever fulfilling the scripture in his
   providential government, which is double--external or internal.

   [1.] External, in the deliverance of his people, the answers of prayer,
   and manifold blessings vouchsafed to believers and their seed See Ps.
   xxii. 4, 5, Our fathers trusted in thee; they trusted, and thou didst
   deliver them: they cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
   thee, and were not confounded.' The godly in former times trusted God,
   and trusted constantly in their troubles, and in their trusting they
   cried, and did never seek God in vain; which should support us in
   waiting upon God, and to depend on his mercy and fidelity; for they
   that place their full affiance in God, and seek his help by constant
   and importunate addresses, shall never be put to shame.

   [2.] Internal, in conversion to God, the comforts of his Spirit,
   establishment of the soul in the hopes of the gospel, as to the pardon
   of sins and eternal life. Certainly God, that hath blessed the word
   throughout many successions of ages, to the converting and comforting
   of many souls, showeth that we may depend upon the covenant for pardon
   and eternal life. How many have found comfort by the promises! Now, as
   the apostle speaketh of Abraham, It was not written for himself alone,
   but us also,' Rom. iv. 23, 24; so these comforts were not dispensed for
   their sake alone, but for our benefit, that we might be comforted of
   God; having the same God, the same Redeemer, the same covenant and
   promises, and the same Spirit to apply all unto us. If they looked to
   God and were comforted, why should not we? His faithfulness is to all
   generations; he is alike to believers, as they be alike to him: Rom.
   iii. 22, There is no difference.'

   5. That the experience of God's faithfulness in former ages is of use
   to those that follow and succeed, to assure them of God's faithfulness;
   for God's wonderful and gracious works were never intended merely for
   the benefit of that age in which they were done, but for the benefit
   also of those that should hear of them by any creditable means
   whatsoever. It is a scorn and vile contempt put upon those wonderful
   works, which God made to be had in remembrance, if they should be
   buried in oblivion, or not observed and improved by those who live in
   after ages; yea, it is contrary to the scriptures: Ps. cxlv. 4, One
   generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy
   mighty acts;' Joel i. 3, Tell ye your children of it, and let your
   children tell their children, and their children another generation;'
   Josh. iv. 6-8, That this may be a sign among you, that when your
   children ask their fathers in time to come, What mean you by these
   stones? then shall you answer them, that the waters of Jordan were cut
   off from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God.' So Ps.
   lxxviii. 3-7, That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have
   told us. we will not hide them from their children, showing to the
   generations to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his
   wonderful works that he hath done. For he established a testimony in
   Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers
   that they should make them known to their children; that the generation
   to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who
   should arise and declare them to their children; that they might set
   their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his
   commandments.' From all which I observe:--

   [1.] That we should tell generations to come what we have found of God
   in our time, and more especially parents should tell their children;
   they are bound to transmit this knowledge to their children, and they
   to improve it, either by word or deed. By word, by remembering the
   passages of providences, and publishing his mercies to posterity: Ps.
   lxxxix. 1, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever: with my
   mouth I will make known thy faithfulness to all generations.' Or by
   deed, putting them in possession of a pure religion, confirmed to us by
   so many providences and instances of God's goodness and truth.

   [2.] That this report of God's gracious works, and owning his covenant,
   is a special means of edification. Why else should God enjoin it, but
   that the ages following should receive benefit thereby? Surely it is an
   advantage to them to hear how God hath owned us in ordinances and
   providences.

   [3.] And more particularly I observe, that this tradition is a great
   means and help to faith; for it is said, ver. 7, That they may set
   their hope in God.'

   6. That to be satisfied in point of God's faithfulness is of great
   importance to believers. Partly because their fidelity to God is much
   encouraged by his fidelity to us. They that do not trust God cannot be
   long true to him: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed lest there be found in any of
   you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;' and
   James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways,'
   di'psuchos ane`r, one that doth not stick fast to God, and is ever
   unresolved, being divided between hopes and fears concerning his
   acceptance with God. A wavering Christian is divided between God and
   some unlawful course for his safety, divided between God's ways and his
   own, and cannot quietly depend upon his promises, but is tossed to and
   fro, doth not entirely trust himself in God's hands, but doth wholly
   lean upon his own carnal confidence. And partly because God is
   invisible, and dealeth with us by proxy, by messengers, who bring the
   word to us. We see not God in person: Heb. xiii. 7, Remember them which
   have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God, whose
   faith follow, considering the end of their conversations;' their manner
   of living, their perseverance till death in this faith and hope. And
   partly because the promises are future, and the main of them is to be
   accomplished in another world. Now, nothing will support us but the
   faithfulness of God: Prov. xi. 18, The wicked worketh a deceitful work,
   but to him that soweth righteousness there shall be a sure reward.' Men
   think to be happy by their sin, but find themselves deceived at last;
   but none can be deceived that trust in the living and true God. Partly
   because many of the promises contradict sense; as when the soul is
   filled with anguish because of the guilt of sin: 1 John i. 9, If we
   confess our sins, be is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
   cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' And the power of sin: 1 Thes. v.
   24, Faithful is he who calleth you, who also will do it.' Supported in
   great distress: 1 Cor. x. 13, He will not suffer you to be tempted
   above that you are able.' That we may be able to stand in the judgment:
   1 Cor. i. 9, God is faithful, by whom ye are called into the fellowship
   of his son Jesus Christ.' Here is a Christian's great security and
   support, God's faithfulness, testified by Christians now and in all
   ages, confessing they have found by their experience the word of God to
   be true; for they have transmitted religion to us by their constant
   consent, and left it to us under a seal of God's faithfulness; and
   therefore we should persevere in our duty to God.

   Secondly, As represented by an emblem. We should consider it, for it is
   a help to frequent meditation, as being always before our eyes; and
   they are without excuse who see not God in this thing; every time we
   set foot on the ground we may remember the stability of God's promises.
   And it is also a confirmation of faith, thus:--

   1. The stability of the earth is the effect of God's word, this is the
   true pillar upon which the earth standeth; for he upholdeth all things
   by the word of his power:' Ps. xxxiii. 9, Tor he spake, and it was
   done; he commanded, and it stood fast.' Now his word of power helpeth
   us to depend upon his word of promise. God, that doth what he pleaseth,
   never faileth in what he promiseth. We see plainly that whatever
   standeth by God's will and word, cannot be brought to nought. Whence is
   it? how came this world to have a being? It is the work and product of
   that God whose word and promise we have in scripture. Certainly the
   power of this God cannot fail, it is as easy for him to do as to say.

   2. Nothing appeareth whereon the globe of the earth and water should
   lean and rest: Job xxvi. 7, He stretcheth out the north over the empty
   place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.' Now, that this vast and
   ponderous body should lean upon the fluid air as upon a firm foundation
   is matter of wonder. The question is put. in the book of Job, chap,
   xxxviii. 6, Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who hath
   laid the corner-stone thereof?' Yet firm it is, though it hang as a
   ball in the air. The globe of the earth is encompassed with the regions
   of the air and the celestial spheres, and hath no visible support to
   sustain so heavy a body hanging in the midst of so vast an expansion;
   yet God hath settled and established it so firm as if it rested on the
   most solid basis and foundation; fitted so strange a place for it that,
   being a heavy body, one should think it would fall every moment; yet
   which, whensoever we would imagine it, it must, contrary to the nature
   of such a body, fall upwards, and so can have no possible ruin but by
   falling into heaven. Now since his word beareth up such a weight, all
   the church's weight, and our own burden leaneth on the promise of God;
   he can, by the power of his word, do the greatest things without
   visible means: Luke vii. 7, But say in a word, and my servant shall be
   healed.' Therefore his people may trust his providence; he is able to
   support them in any distresses, when no way of help and relief
   appeareth.

   3. The firmness and stability offereth itself to our thoughts. The
   earth abideth in the same seat and condition wherein God left it, as
   long as the present course and order of nature is to continue: Ps. civ.
   5, He hath laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
   moved for ever.' God's truth is as immovable as the earth: Ps. cxvii.
   2, The truth of the Lord endureth for ever.' Surely, if the foundation
   of the earth abideth sure, the foundation of our salvation laid by
   Jesus Christ is much more sure: Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
   not one tittle of the word and law of God, till all be fulfilled,' Mat.
   v. 18. If the law given by Moses be so sure, much more the promises of
   salvation by Christ: 2 Cor. i. 20, For all the promises of God in him
   are yea and amen.'

   4. The stability in the midst of changes: Eccles. i. 4, One generation
   passeth away and another cometh, but the earth abideth for ever.' When
   man passeth away, the earth stayeth behind him, as a habitation for
   other comers, and abideth where it was, when the inhabitants go to and
   fro, and can enjoy it no more. All things in the world are subject to
   many revolutions, but God's truth is one and the same. The vicissitudes
   in the world do not derogate from his fidelity in the promises; he
   changeth all things, and is not changed. Though there be a new face of
   things in the world, yet we have a sure rule to walk by, and sure
   promises to build upon. And therefore, in all conditions, we should be
   the same to God, and there is no doubt but he will be the same to us.

   5. In upholding the frame of the world, all those attributes are seen
   which are a firm stay to a believer's heart, such as wisdom, power, and
   goodness. Wisdom: Prov. iii. 19, The Lord by wisdom hath founded the
   earth, by understanding hath lie established the heavens,' Look on it,
   it is the work of a wise agent. So for power: This great fabric is
   supported by his almighty power. His goodness is seen in that he hath
   made the earth to be firm and dry land, that it may be a fit habitation
   for men; this is a standing miracle of goodness. Luther saith we are
   always in medio rubri maris--kept, as the Israelites were, in the midst
   of the Red Sea. The Psalmist telleth us, Ps. xxiv. 2, He hath founded
   the earth upon the seas, and established the world upon the floods.'
   That part of the world whereon we dwell would suddenly be overwhelmed
   and covered with waters were it not for the goodness of God, for this
   the order of nature showeth in the beginning of the creation, Gen. i.
   7, that next under the air were the waters covering the whole surface
   of the earth. But God made such cavities in the earth as should receive
   the waters into them, and such banks as should bound and bridle the
   vast ocean, that it might not break forth, Gen. i. 9; and so now by his
   providence the water is beneath the earth, and the earth standeth firm
   upon that fluid body as upon the most solid foundation; which, as it is
   a work of wise disposal and contrivance, so an effect of the goodness
   of God for the preservation of mankind. And though once, for the sins
   of the world, these waters were appointed to break out and overwhelm
   the earth, yet God hath firmly promised that they shall never be so
   again; wherein his truth is also verified, and applied to the covenant
   of grace: Isa. liv. 9, For this is as the waters of Noah to me; for as
   I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth;
   so have I sworn that I would not be wrath with thee, nor rebuke thee.'
   The covenant of grace is as sure as the covenant made after the deluge;
   so that we cannot look upon this earth but as an emblem of those
   attributes which confirm our faith in waiting upon God till his
   promises be fulfilled to us.

   Use. Let us be then more firmly persuaded of God's faithfulness, that
   we may depend upon it both for his preserving the church and ourselves
   in the way of our duty, till we enjoy our final reward.

   1. For the preservation of Christ's kingdom, God's faithfulness chiefly
   appeareth in the government of his church or spiritual kingdom, and
   this is a kingdom that cannot be moved when all things else are shaken:
   Heb. xii. 28, Having received a kingdom that cannot be shaken.' Christ
   cannot be a head without members, a king without subjects. And we are
   told. Mat xvi. 18, That the gates of hell cannot prevail against it.'
   Many disorders happen, but let us depend upon the faithful God. The
   world was well guided before we came into it, and other generations
   have had experience of God's faithfulness, though we complain that we
   see not our signs, nor any tokens for good.

   2. For the preservation of our bodies to the heavenly kingdom. We have
   many discouragements within and without, but while we persevere in our
   duty, God will not fail us; his word is as sure as the earth: 2 Thes.
   iii. 3, The Lord is faithful, who shall establish and keep you from
   evil.' God hath promised not only to give us our final reward, but to
   secure and defend his people by the way, that they be not overcome by
   the evils they meet with in their passage.

SERMON XCVI.

   They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy
   servants.--Ver. 91.

   THE prophet is proving the immutability of God's promises from the
   conservation and continuance of the whole course of nature. He had
   spoken of it by parts, now conjunctly; apart, first of the heavens,
   ver. 89; of the earth, ver. 90; now both together, they continue, &c.

   In the words we have two things:--

   1. An observation concerning the continuance of the courses of nature;
   they, that is, the heaven and the earth. Heaven doth continue in its
   motion, and earth in its station, according to the ordinance of God,
   that is, by virtue of that order wherein he placed things at first: Ps.
   cxlviii. 6, He hath established them for ever and ever: he hath made a
   decree which shall not pass.' As he ordained at first by his powerful
   decree, so heaven and earth is still continued. God's laws are fixed
   for the government of all creatures, and in the manner and to the end
   for which God appointeth them they stand and continue.

   2. The reason, for all are thy servants. The reason saith more than the
   assertion, and therefore doth over and above prove it; not only the
   heavens and the earth, but all things which are contained therein, from
   the angel to the worm, they all serve God; they attend upon him as
   their supreme Lord and master every moment.

   Doct. That it is a great help to faith to consider God as the omni
   potent creator, preserver, and absolute governor of the world,
   disposing of all things as he pleaseth.

   This is the meditation which the Psalmist produceth and exposeth to our
   view in this verse.

   His creation is implied in that, thine ordinances; when God first
   settled the course of nature by a wise and powerful decree.

   His preservation, in those words, they continue this day. The course of
   nature is so settled that it doth not fail to go on according to God's
   decree; everything standeth or falleth according to God's command, and
   the order first settled by God still obtaineth; his decree is not yet
   out of date.

   His being the absolute governor of the world, in these words, for all
   are thy servants, which implieth his sovereign dominion and empire over
   all the creatures as his servants, who are at the beck of his will. To
   evidence this to you more fully, consider there are in God two
   things--power and authority, might and right.

   First, By power we mean a liberty and sufficiency in God to do whatever
   he will: With God all things are possible,' Mat. xix. 26. Or take the
   negative, which bindeth it the stronger: Luke i. 37, With God nothing
   shall be impossible.'

   Secondly, Authority or dominion, or a right over all things to dispose
   of them at his own pleasure. In this right there are three branches:--

   1. A right of making or framing anything as he willeth, in any manner
   as it pleaseth him, as the potter hath power over his own clay to form
   what vessel he pleaseth of it. This right God exercised in his
   creation: Rev. iv. 11 , Thou hast created all things, and for thy
   pleasure they are and were created.' This was his absolute freedom and
   sovereignty, to create all things according to his own pleasure.

   2. A right of having or possessing all things so made and framed by
   him, for God is owner and possessor of whatever he made, since he made
   it out of nothing. Heaven is his, earth is his; so angels, man, beasts,
   gold, silver; all things he challengeth as his right: Ps. cxv. 16, The
   heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's.' It is the Lord's to dispose
   of, not only the lower, but the highest heavens, which he hath provided
   for his own palace and court of residence. So the earth is the Lord's,
   and the fulness therefore,' Ps. xxiv. 1. This whole lower world is his
   by right of creation and providential preservation, and so are all the
   sorts of creatures with which he hath replenished it: it was by him
   produced at first, and every moment continued and preserved. And so the
   angels are his; they are called his ministers or servants: Ps. civ. 4,
   He maketh his angels spirits, his ministers a flame of fire.' Though he
   is able to do all things by himself, or administer the whole world as
   he at first created by a word, by saying, and it was done; yet he
   pleaseth to make use of the ministry of angels, who some of them in
   subtle bodies of air, others of fire, come down to execute his commands
   upon earth. Men are his creatures and his possession; we are not lords
   of anything we have, neither life, nor limb, nor anything; our bodies
   and our souls are his, 1 Cor. vi. 20. Christ had power to lay down his
   life and take it up again, but no mere man hath; he is accountable to a
   higher Lord, who hath an absolute, uncontrollable right to dispose of
   us according to his own pleasure: He killeth and maketh alive, bringeth
   low and lifteth up; for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's,' 1
   Sam. ii. 6-8; meaning that God is the Lord of the dwellers upon earth,
   from the one pole to the other: Dan. iv. 35, None can stay his hand,
   and say unto him, What doest thou?' None can call him to an account,
   for his will is absolute. So for the beasts: Ps. l. 10, Every beast of
   the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.' He hath a
   plenary dominion over all the cattle on earth, wild and tame, and the
   fowls of the air, and a certain knowledge where every one of them
   resideth, that he can readily command any or all of them whensoever he
   pleaseth; all is the Lord's by primitive right. So for gold and silver,
   and those precious things which are most valued by men: Hag. ii. 8, The
   silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.' The
   absolute dominion of the riches or the splendour of the world belongeth
   to the Lord of hosts, to dispose of them as he pleaseth; and therefore
   is to be owned, acknowledged, and submitted unto by every man in his
   lot and portion. All that we want he hath at his command, and would not
   withhold it, if it were not for our good.

   3. He hath a right of using and disposing, and governing all things
   thus in his possession, according to his own pleasure. Certainly the
   use and benefit and utility of anything belongeth to him whose it is.
   Now God, who is the disposer of all things, made them for himself; he
   governeth them ultimately and terminatively for himself, immediately
   for man: Prov. xvi. 4, God hath made all things for himself.' But he
   considereth man's good subordinately in all sublunary things; for the
   earth he hath given to the children of men,' Ps. cxv. 16, chiefly to
   his people, Rom. viii. 28. But this government of God is
   twofold--either natural or moral.

   [1.] I begin with the last. His moral government is by laws; so he
   governeth angels and men, who are rational and free agents, but in the
   relation of subjects to God, and therefore are under his command; which
   if they decline, they are rebels, yet cease not to be under God, H3 the
   devils and wicked men, who have disturbed the order of the creation,
   and withdrawn themselves from God's government, yet they cease not to
   be under his power. Of the devils, we read they sinned, 2 Peter ii. 4,
   and therefore were thrown down into chains of darkness:' meaning
   thereby, their unappeasable horrors, and the restraints of God's
   invisible providence'. Of men, that they withdrew their allegiance, and
   would not be subject to his laws: Ps. xii. 4, Our tongues are our own:
   who is lord over us?' Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is not subject to
   the law of God.' But yet they are under the restraints of his
   providence, and he governeth all their actions to his glory: Ps. lxxvi.
   10, Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee;' and serveth himself and
   the designs of his providence of their sins.

   [2.] His natural government is that order into which by his positive
   decree God hath necessitated and disposed all creatures for the benefit
   of the world. Rational creatures he ruleth by moral means, as subjects,
   requiring duty from them, under the sanction of penalties and rewards,
   where the law is the rule of our duty, the sanction of his process; but
   other creatures he ruleth by natural motions and inclinations or
   tendency, according to the decree and order which he hath settled in
   their creation. Surely such a kind of empire he hath over all his
   creatures, for if he had made creatures which he cannot rule, he could
   not carry on his providence, for there would be something beneath him
   which might resist his will, and that will not suit with the perfection
   of God. Now this natural government is twofold--ordinary or extra
   ordinary.

   (1.) Ordinary is that which is according to the course of second
   causes, or that order of nature which God hath established in the
   world, which is nothing else but his preserving the creatures, and
   working by them according to their natural motions. So it is said in
   the text. ' They continue this day according to thine ordinance;' and
   is confirmed by the apostle, Heb. i. 3, He upholdeth all things by the
   word of his power;' that is, in that course wherein he hath set them.
   The being and motion of every creature is ordered by the will of God;
   they move as he hath set them, and can move no further nor longer than
   he supplieth them with power.

   (2.) Extraordinary is when God doth things above or beside nature; as
   when he made the sun stand still upon Gibeon, and the moon in the
   valley Ajalon, Josh. x. 12, 13; or made the sun to go back ten degrees
   in Ahaz's dial, Isa. xxxviii. 8; his interdicting the Red Sea that it
   should not flow, Exod. xiv. 22; causing iron, which is a heavy body,
   that it should swim upon the top of the water at the prayer of Elisha,
   2 Kings vi. 5; the fiery furnace not to burn, Dan. iii. 22; shutting
   the mouths of hungry lions, Dan. vi. 22; making ravens, which are by
   nature birds of prey, to be caterers for Elijah, 1 Kings xvii. 6; the
   cleaving of the earth and swallowing up Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Num.
   xvi. 32, 33. Often in the New Testament we find the creatures acting
   contrary to their common nature, as the star that directed the wise men
   to Christ, Mat. ii. 2; the opening of the heavens at Christ's baptism,
   Mat. iii. 16; the eclipse of the sun at his death, Mat. xxvii. 45; the
   fishes that came to net, Luke v. 5; and furnishing money, Mat. xvii.
   26; the sea to be as firm ground to Peter, Mat. xiv. 24-29; Christ
   stilling the tempest of a sudden, Mat. viii. 26; the earth quake at
   Christ's death, Mat. xxvii. 51; the tree suddenly withered, Mat. xxi.
   14. When the will of God is so that the creatures shall depart from
   their own private nature for a common good, we see how readily they
   obey him.

   Now I shall prove to you that no creature can decline or avoid this
   dominion. The text saith, They are all his servants;' that is, all at
   the beck and will of God.

   1. The celestial bodies are his servants: Isa. xlviii. 13, Mine hand
   also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath
   spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together;'
   where they are compared to. servants that stand attending on great
   persons, ready at a word or beck to obey their Lord and master, and go
   instantly about whatever he doth enjoin them.

   2. The angels, the inhabitants of heaven, are said to be his ministers
   and hosts; and therefore he is called the Lord of hosts;' and it is
   said, They fulfil his pleasure, hearkening to the voice of his word,'
   Ps. ciii. 21.

   3. The winds and seas, and storms: Ps. cxxxv. 6, Whatsoever the Lord
   pleased that did he in heaven, and in earth, and in the seas, and all
   deep places;' again, Ps. cxlviii. 8, Fire and hail, snow and vapour,
   stormy wind fulfilling his word.' So Job xxxvii. 12, The clouds are
   turned about by his counsels.' The changes in the air by storms and
   tempests are not by chance, but are all directed by God for some intent
   of his; and in what work he doth employ them they fail not to execute
   his will, and by these things many times God hath executed great
   matters in the world: Judges v. 20, The stars in their course fought
   against Sisera.' By their influence, Josephus saith, caused a great
   storm of hail and rain, that they could not hold up their targets.

   4. Sickness and disease: Mat viii. 9, Speak but the word, and my
   servant shall be healed.' Christ wondered at his faith. So that all
   things contained in heaven and earth are at God's beck, and do
   whatsoever he hath ordained.

   Use 1. To teach us to increase our faith by this meditation. There are
   two things by which we glorify God--by subjection and dependence; or,
   the two bonds by which we adhere to him are faith and obedience: faith,
   by which we trust ourselves in his hands; obedience, by which we submit
   to his will; to his commanding will by holiness, to his disposing will
   by patience. Now the one increaseth the other. Faith doth mightily
   befriend obedience; if we can depend upon God, we will subject
   ourselves, and be faithful to him. The first cause of man's warping was
   that he would be at his own finding. God taunted him with it: Gen. iii.
   22, And the Lord said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know
   good and evil.' While man contented his mind in the wisdom, goodness,
   and all-sufficiency of God, he kept innocent; but when he grew
   distrustful of God, and desired, as the prodigal, to have the stock and
   portion in his own hands, he presently fell from God, and would
   preserve himself by his own shifts and skill. The reason why we are not
   faithful to God is want of faith and trust in his fatherly care, and
   will be at our own finding Heb. iii. 12. Trust him, and you will adhere
   to him; distrust him, and you will depart from him. Man would have his
   safety and comfort in his own hand rather than God's; and this is a
   deadly blow to our obedience.

   2. There is one consideration feedeth and encourageth both our
   dependence upon God and our subjection to him, and that is a sound and
   thorough persuasion of God's all-sufficiency: Gen xvii. 1, I am God
   Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.' We will trust God in
   the way of our duty, and not fly to our own carnal shifts. Now that
   which doth assure us of God's power and all-sufficiency to effect his
   promises and do us good is that which is here represented.

   p.] His power is implied, which made the world out of nothing. Other
   artificers must have matter to work upon, or else their art will fail.
   The mason must have timber and stones prepared to his hand, or he
   cannot build a house. The goldsmith must have gold and silver, or he
   cannot make so much as a cup or a ring. But God made the world out of
   things that did not appear, Heb. xi. 4, yet it standeth fast. Now this
   power is engaged to us in the promises.

   [2.] Here is a power which placeth and maintaineth all things in their
   order, both in heaven and earth, and causeth every part of nature to do
   its office; and therefore, why should not we live in a total dependence
   upon God for life and being every moment? What God hath once settled,
   it doth and shall continue in the order that he hath appointed; the
   same power that created them upholdeth them; the same wisdom directeth
   and ordereth them still. Therefore, when he hath settled grace in the
   established order of a covenant with his people, the word of God is a
   foundation that cannot fail; for God needeth no other means to effect
   anything but his own word and will. The word of God is as powerful in
   the work of grace as in the works of nature, to renew, convince,
   subdue, and comfort the heart: Heb. iv. 12, For the word of God is
   quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even
   to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:' 2
   Cor. x. 4, 5, For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
   through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down
   imaginations, and everything that exalteth itself against the knowledge
   of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
   Christ.' Depend upon that word, Ps. cxxx. 5, I wait for the Lord; my
   soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.' It is as unchangeable as
   powerful: Isa. xlv. 23, The word is gone out of my mouth in
   righteousness, and shall not return;' Ps. lxxxix. 34, I will not alter
   the thing that is gone out of my lips.'

   [3.] Here is a power to which they are subject, For they are his
   servants;' and be they never so averse and opposite to God, they cannot
   hinder his work, for he performeth what he will, and who can let?
   Certainly what God hath engaged himself to do he will not fail to bring
   it to pass, to give grace at present and glory hereafter, Ps. lxxxiv.
   11. Look neither upon the weakness of the means, nor the greatness of
   the work, but the truth and power of him that promised.

   3. Here is something offered to each apart, both to feed trust and
   dependence, and to engage to subjection and obedience.

   First, For trust and dependence.

   [1.] We see here that God is a great God, who taketh the care and
   charge upon him of the sustentation and government of all things to
   their proper ends and uses. How soon would the world fall into
   confusion and nothing without his power and care! Now this should
   recommend him to our esteem and love. Oh, what a blessed thing is it to
   have an interest in this powerful and almighty God! All his strength
   and power is engaged for the meanest and weakest of his children: 1
   Peter i. 5, We are kept by the power of God to salvation:' and
   therefore we are bidden to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
   his might.' Surely they are blessed that have such a mighty God on
   their side, and engaged with them against their enemies: 1 John iv. 4,
   Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.' He can
   enable them to do their work, satisfy their desires, maintain them in
   the midst of opposition: John x. 29, My father, which gave them me, is
   greater than all.' Such is the efficacy of his providence, that he can
   subject ail things to himself, make them servants, to do what he would
   have them. Oh, how safe is a Christian in the love and covenant and
   arms of an almighty God, whom he hath made his refuge! Our trials are
   many, and grace received is small in the best; but our God is great; he
   that made all things, and sustaineth things and governeth all things,
   and possesseth all things, is our trod; surely his grace is sufficient
   for us,' 2 Cor. xii. 9, and his ever lasting arms can bear us up: Deut.
   xxxiii. 27, The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
   everlasting arms.' He can recover us from our falls, and lift us over
   all our difficulties. If we could but rest upon his word and lean upon
   his power, why should we be discouraged? Oh, let us rejoice, then, not
   only in the goodness but greatness of that God whom we have chosen for
   our portion!

   [2.] We see here that God is an unchangeable God in goodness They
   continue this day according to thine ordinance.' The stability of his
   works showeth how stable the workman is. Heaven and earth continue by
   virtue of his word, that man may have the use and benefit of it from
   generation to generation, that the continual vicissitudes of day and
   night may be continued, that man may have light to his labour and
   darkness drawn about him as a covering for his rest, and also that
   there might be a constant succession of summer and winter to prepare
   and ripen the fruits of the earth. Now, if God forsake not the world
   will he forsake his people? For the benefit of mankind he preserveth
   the courses of nature, and keepeth all things in their proper place for
   their roper end and use; and will he not keep one way with his
   children? there be a failure in the covenant, when there is not a
   failure in common providence? as if he would satisfy the expectation of
   heathens that look for a constant succession of day and night and
   summer and winter, and would not satisfy the expectation of his
   children, when they look for a blessed morning after a dark night of
   trouble and conflict, and the light of his countenance after the storms
   of temptation

   Secondly, For subjection, which I made to be double.

   [1.] Submission to his disposing will. God's appointment giveth laws to
   all; there is not the least thing done among us without his prescience,
   providence, and wise disposal, to which all things in the world are
   subjected. The Lord's will and pleasure is the only rule of his
   extending his omnipotency, and is the sovereign and absolute cause of
   all his working, for all is done in heaven or in earth according to his
   ordinance and no creature can resist his will; therefore let us submit
   to this will of God. If God take anything from us, let us bless the
   name of the Lord; he doth but make use of his own: It is the Lord let
   him do what seemeth him good,' 1 Sam. iii. 18; it is none of ours, but
   God's, and let him do with his own as it pleaseth him. God is the
   disposer of man as well as other creatures, and must choose their
   condition, and determine of all events wherein they are concerned. We
   usually dislike God's disposal of us, though it be so wise and gracious
   lit consider his sovereignty; you cannot deliver yourselves from the
   will of God, and get the reins into your own hands. And alas! we are
   unfit to be disposers either of the world or ourselves, as an idiot is
   to be the pilot of a ship: therefore let God govern all according to
   his own pleasure. Say, Lord, not my will, but thine be done.' We are
   safer by far in God's hands than our own.

   [2.] Obedience to his commanding will. All creatures do serve God as
   his word hath ordained; so should we do. We have law and ordinances
   too. Shall man only be eccentric and exorbitant and transgress his
   bounds? Winds and sea serve him, only man, made after his image,
   disobeyeth him: they serve God for our benefit; the heavens continue
   their motion to convey light, heat, and influence to us, and the air to
   give us breath and motion, and the earth to be a sure fixed
   dwelling-place. When all things are created and continued for our use,
   shall not we serve our bountiful creator? We are sensible of the
   disturbance of the course of nature when these confederances are
   dissolved, when the floods increase, or rains fall in abundance. Oh, be
   moan rather thy own irregular actions, which are a greater deformation
   of the beauty of the universe!

   In short, no creatures are sui juris; they are subject to God, by whose
   word and commandment they must rule their actions. Surely none of us
   are too great or too good to submit to God. Angels enjoy immunities,
   yet are not exempted from service. The creatures have acted contrary to
   their common nature for God's honour; let us obey God, though contrary
   to our own wills and inclinations.

SERMON XCVII.

   Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in
   mine affliction.--Ver. 92.

   IN the verses before the text, David meditateth upon the constancy of
   the course of nature, whereby is represented God's constant fidelity in
   performing all his promises to his people. Now he produceth his own
   experience, and showeth that all this had been matter of most pleasant
   meditation to support him under his afflictions; when all other
   comforts failed, he found sufficient consolation in the word of God,
   unless thy law had been, &c.

   In which words observe--

   1. David's condition; he was afflicted.

   2. His bitter sense of that condition; he was ready to perish in his
   affliction.

   3. His remedy; the word of God.

   4. The way of application; it was his delights.

   1. For his condition. Though he was a man after God's own heart, yet he
   had his troubles: Ps. cxxxii. 1, Remember David, Lord, and all his
   afflictions.'

   2. For his sense and apprehension, I should then have perished.' Then;
   that is, long since. If you suppose him now under trouble, probably he
   should have sunk under the weight of it; or if out of trouble, he
   remembereth from experience what did comfort him when he was ready to
   perish. But how perished? It may be understood--

   [1.] Either as given over to the will of his enemies, if he had not
   confided in God; for all human help and comfort was cut off, and then
   did divine help appear.

   [2.] Died for sorrow; for worldly sorrow worketh death,' 2 Cor. vii.
   10. We are apt to despond and despair in great and sore troubles.
   Affliction worketh heaviness, 1 Peter i. 6, and heaviness drieth the
   hones and wasteth our strength. What kept him?

   3. His remedy was the word of God; for he saith, Unless thy law had
   been my delights,' Some take the word law strictly, for the precepts of
   the law, which keepeth us from sin, which doth involve us in danger.
   But rather it is taken for the whole word of God, and chiefly for the
   promises of support and deliverance. I had despaired if I had not
   consulted with thy word. He doth not here speak of direction, but of
   support; elsewhere he found nothing but sorrow, but in the word of God
   joy and comfort.

   4. The way of application, my delights. The word is plural, and
   increaseth the sense, in what way soever it may be interpreted. Now it
   may be interpreted passively or actively.

   [1.] Passively, that the word of God refreshed him, and afforded him
   matter of delight, and so renewed his strength. David had many sorrows,
   but here he found delights, as many comforts as troubles. The word of
   God yieldeth comfort for every state of life; if there be many sorrows,
   there are many delights; but with advantage, heavenly comforts for
   earthly afflictions, eternal comforts for temporal sorrows.

   [2.] Actively. He delighted in the word of God, yea, counted it his
   delights. It increaseth the sense.

   (1.) It was his chief delight. Other things might be thankfully
   accepted and acknowledged, but this was the solace and delight of his
   soul.

   (2.) His continual delight and comfort, to which he retreated upon all
   occasions.

   (3.) His whole, or only delight; when deprived of all other things,
   this was instead of all delights to him: all which show his high esteem
   of the word.

   Doct. That the afflicted man's true consolation is in the word of God.

   I will pursue the point in the method that I have laid forth in the
   parts of the text.

   First, A man after God's own heart, such as David was, may be
   afflicted. Why?

   1. Because God hath chosen another way of expressing his love to his
   people than by outward things; for he will govern the spiritual part of
   the world by faith, and not by sense: therefore None shall know love
   and hatred by things that are before him,' Eccles. ix. 1; that is, by
   mere outward events, or things obvious to outward sense; the
   significations of his love are more hidden. Prov. iii. 31, 32, Solomon
   supposeth that the oppressor may be in a flourishing condition, yet all
   this while the Lord hates him; his secret is with the righteous. We
   know his fatherly love to us, not by things without us, but things
   within us, Rom. viii. 16; 1 John iii. 2, 4, Hereby we know that he
   abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us:' Gal. iv. 6, He
   hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts.' Outward things
   would soon be overvalued, and we should take them as our whole felicity
   and portion, if, besides their suitableness to our present needs and
   appetites, they should come to us as special evidences of God's love.

   2. Afflictions are necessary to the best. Certain it is God will
   conduct his people to glory, not only by his internal, but external
   providence. Now to humble us, to wean us from the world, there is need
   of afflictions: 1 Peter i. 6, Ye are in heaviness for a season, if need
   be.' We are wanton, vain, neglectful of God, unmindful of heavenly
   things; if God did not put us under the discipline of the cross, our
   minds and hearts would be more alienated from God and heavenly things:
   Ps. cxix. 67, Before I was afflicted I went astray.' Now, since the
   best need it, God will not be wanting in any part or point of necessary
   government to them.

   3. That they may know the worth and benefit of God's word, and the
   comfort of it may be seen and felt by experience, how able it is to
   support us, and to uphold a sinking heart under any trouble whatsoever,
   Rom. xv. 4. In full prosperity, when we seem to live upon the creature,
   we know not the benefit of God's promise, nor how to live by faith; as
   the use of bladders in swimming is not known while we are upon firm
   land. The word of God provideth comforts for the obedient, not only at
   the end of the journey, but for their support at present, while they
   are in the way. These comforts would be useless if never put upon the
   trial; therefore none of God's children must look to be exempted: 1
   Peter v. 9, All these afflictions are accomplished in your brethren
   that are in the world.' Our condition is no harder than the rest of the
   saints of God that have passed through the world.

   Secondly, David was ready to sink under his burden; and so are other
   the people of God ready to perish, when they look to the bare
   afflictions. This may come:--

   1. From the grievousness of the affliction, which staggereth and
   amazeth them: Ps. lx. 3, Thou hast showed thy people hard things; thou
   hast made us to drink of the wine of astonishment.' Their thoughts are
   confounded, as a man that has taken a poisonous potion. They know not
   to what hand to turn, are wholly dispirited, and put out of all
   comfort.

   2. It comes from the weakness of the saints. There is some weakness and
   imbecility in the best, more than they are aware of; as when David was
   ready to faint under the cross before troubles came. We are like unto
   Peter, we think we can walk upon the sea; but some boisterous wind or
   other assaults our confidence, and then we cry out, Help, Master, we
   perish,' Mat. xiv. 30. We reckon only upon the sea, but do not think of
   the wind, and so our weakness is made evident by proof. Whence cometh
   this weakness?

   [1.] Partly because we look more to the creature than to God, and to
   our dangers than to the power that is to carry us through them: Isa.
   li. 12, 13, I, even I, am he that comforteth thee: who art thou, that
   thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man
   that shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that
   hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
   earth; and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of
   the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of
   the oppressor?' We that have the immortal and almighty God to be our
   protector and saviour, why should we be afraid of a frail, mortal man?

   [2.] If they look to God, yet God doth not seem to look to them. If a
   thin curtain be drawn between God and us, we are presently dismayed, as
   if he were wholly gone; and because of our hardships, question the love
   of God: Ps. lxxvii. 9, Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in
   anger shut up his tender mercies?' Isa. xlix. 14, Zion hath said, The
   Lord hath forsaken me, my God hath for gotten me;' though our condition
   be everyway consistent with the fatherly love of God: Heb. xii. 5, Have
   you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh to you as children?' We
   are children, though under discipline; and God is a father, though he
   frowneth as well as smileth.

   [3.] Impatiency of delay; if we question not his love, yet cannot tarry
   his leisure. Certainly it is very good to wait God's leisure; though he
   seemeth asleep, he will awake for our help. Faith makes us like people
   that dig the pit, and wait for the rain to come down and fill it; to
   lay the cloth, though we know not whence the provision will be sent.
   But the people of God have not always the strength of faith, and
   therefore faint, and are ready to perish: I said in my haste, I am cut
   off,' Ps. xxxi. 22.

   [4.] Religion itself entendereth the heart; a father's anger is no
   slight thing to a gracious soul. When we are afflicted, and God is
   angry, the trouble is the more grievous, and it is hard to steer right
   between the two rocks of slighting and fainting. Well, then, pity poor
   creatures under their burden, and help them, but censure them not.

   Thirdly, His remedy, God's word; there is the paradise of delights, and
   the only requies to allay the bitter sense of all our troubles. Why?

   1. As to the main blessings, there is represented to us the true
   fountain of all comfort, who is God, the Father of mercies, and the God
   of all comfort, 2 Cor. i. 13; who distributeth comfort when and where
   and to whom he pleaseth.

   2. There is discovered to us the meritorious and procuring cause, who
   is Jesus Christ: Who hath given us everlasting consolation and good
   hope through grace,' 2 Thes. ii. 16.

   3. The Spirit, who is the applier of all comfort, therefore called the
   Comforter; and he giveth us peace and joy in believing, Rom. xv. 3.

   4. The true instrument, means, or condition whereby we receive comfort,
   and that is faith, John xiv. 1.

   5. The true matter of comfort, and that is pardon and life.

   [1.] Pardon and reconciliation with God, Rom. v. 10. No solid cause of
   rejoicing till then, when reconciled to God; then true peace, and peace
   that passeth all understanding, which will guard both heart and mind,
   Phil. iv. 7; then all miseries are unstinged. Solid peace of conscience
   is your best support and comfort under afflictions, the intrinsic evil
   of afflictions is then taken away: Lam. iii. 39, Wherefore doth a
   living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?' While sin
   remaineth unpardoned. the thorn still remaineth in the sore.

   [2.] The promise of eternal life, Rom. v. 2. There is the crown set
   against the cross, heavenly comforts against earthly afflictions; the
   afflictions of God's children comparatively are light and short: 2 Cor.
   iv. 17, This light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
   us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' Nothing should be
   grievous to them that know a world to come, where all tears shall be
   wiped from our eyes, and we shall enjoy fulness of joy and pleasure for
   evermore.

   6. It showeth us who are the parties capable--the renewed or
   sanctified: Ps. xxxii. 11, Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye
   righteous, and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.' To all
   Christ's sincere, faithful, and obedient servants, these promises are
   matter of abundant joy.

   As to particular comforts concerning afflictions, it is endless to in
   stance in all, but take a few instances.

   1. The word of God teaches us not only how to bear them, but how to
   improve them. As it teaches us how to bear them, it breedeth quietness
   and submission; but as it teaches us how to improve them, it breedeth
   peace and joy. To bear: Micah vii. 9, I will bear the indignation of
   the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause,
   and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I
   shall behold his righteousness.' To improve them: Heb. xii. 11,
   righteousness brings peace along with it. The fruit is better than the
   deliverance, as we get spiritual advantage by them, as they promote
   repentance, purge out sin, bring us home to God. They rid us of the
   matter -of our trouble, and bring us to the centre of our rest.

   2. The word teaches to depend upon God for the moderating of them, and
   deliverance from them, 1 Cor. x. 13. Before he giveth a passage out of
   our pressures, he vouchsafeth present support to us, and will not
   permit his servants to be tempted beyond what they are able to bear.

   3. His people have most experience of God under the cross; they have a
   more peculiar allowance from God for sufferings than for ordinary
   services. Paul was strongest when weak, 2 Cor. xii. 9, 10. The greater
   pressures, the more sensible the divine assistance. And when ordinary
   means fail, and they are pressed above their own strength, the more
   visible the proof of God's help. When they are most apt to have
   jealousies of God's love, they have had the highest manifestations of
   it; never more liberty than in the house of bondage; most of God's
   smiles when all things seem to frown upon them. In short, have had more
   understanding, not only of God's word, but his love.

   4. God's governing all things for the benefit of his people: Rom. viii.
   28, And we know that all things work together for good to them that
   love God;' sure, then, afflictions. Now they submitting, and being
   exercised under sharp dispensations, may find it verified to them; many
   things seem for our hurt intendedly, many thought so by ourselves, but
   God knoweth how to bring good out of them, Cant. iv. 16.

   Fourthly, David saith, My delights.' They that seek their solace and
   delight in the word shall find it there. It is an excellent frame of
   heart to be satisfied with the comforts which the word offereth; every
   one cannot be thus affected. To raise this delight:--

   1. Faith is necessary; for the comforts of the word are received and
   improved by faith. Unless we expect the sure accomplishment of God's
   promises, how can we be supported by them? Ps. xxvii. 13, I had fainted
   unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
   the living:' that is, without a full assent to the promises which God
   had made him of his restoration, for he had particular assurance of the
   kingdom, as we have of the kingdom of heaven. So for the consent, as
   well as assent, to take the happiness contained in the promises as our
   whole felicity: Ps. cxix. 111, Thy testimonies have I taken as an
   heritage for ever; they are the rejoicing of my heart.' There is
   heritage and portion rich enough in God's promises, and this breedeth
   joy in all afflictions.

   2. Meditation is necessary; for thereby the sweetness of the word is
   perceived and tasted, and the promises laid before us. It is the fruit
   of delight: Ps. i. 2, But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in
   his law doth he meditate day and night.' And it is the cause of it: Ps.
   civ. 34, My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the
   Lord.' They who delight in a thing will often view it and consider it,
   and thereby their delight is increased. The most lively truths work not
   on us for want of serious consideration.

   3. There must be mortification and self-denial, or prizing spiritual
   favours before temporal benefits. The cross will not be grievous to a
   mortified spirit, when, they compare their gain with their loss, 2 Cor.
   iv. 16. To others we speak in vain, whose hearts are set upon worldly
   advantages; but they who value all things in order to the chief good,
   and have weaned their hearts from the false happiness, they have their
   end if they be brought nearer to God, though by a bitter and sharp
   means.

   Use 1. Reproof to four sorts.

   1. To those that know no comfort but what ariseth from the enjoyments
   of sense. Alas! these comforts are dreggy and base, and leave a taint
   upon the soul, Jude 19. Again, they leave us destitute when we most
   need comfort, Job xxvii. 8. When other comforts forsake us, and have
   spent their allowance, the comforts of the word abide with us. Again,
   these comforts increase our grief, though for a time they seem to
   mitigate and allay it. They are like strong waters, that warm the
   stomach for the present, but destroy the true temper and natural heat
   of it, and leave it the colder afterwards; they cheer us a little, but
   the end of that mirth is heaviness. Oh! how much better are the
   comforts of God's word, which giveth us matter of joy in the saddest
   condition; and do not only save us from desperation in troubles, but
   make us rejoice in tribulation, and can bring pleasure to us in our
   bitterest afflictions! There are breasts of consolation for every
   distressed creature to suck at and be saved.

   2. It reproves them that think philosophy as good, or a better
   institution than Christianity. Certainly we should own the wisdom of
   God, by what hand soever it is conveyed to us; as Elijah refused not
   his meat though brought by ravens. But when this is done by men of a
   profane wit, in a contempt of God, we must convince them of their
   dangerous error and mistake, and show how complete we are in Christ,
   that we be not spoiled by the rudiments of vain wisdom or philosophy,
   Col. ii. 8. Surely God's comforts have greatest authority over the
   conscience to silence all our murmurings, Ps. xciv. 19. Man speaks to
   us by the evidence of reason, but in scripture God himself speaks to
   us, and impawneth his truth with us to do us good. They knew not the
   true cause of trouble, sin; nor the true remedy, Jesus Christ. And
   surely those great mysteries of Christ as procurer of comfort, the
   Spirit as the applier, heaven as the matter, the word as the warrant,
   faith as the means to receive, all these are a more accommodate means
   to settle the conscience than those little glimmerings of light which
   refined nature discovered. They speak of submitting out of necessity,
   little of reducing the heart to God; and their very doctrines for
   comfort were rather a libel against providence than a sure ground of
   peace and tranquillity of mind; and they taught men to eradicate the
   affections rather than to govern and quiet them; and therefore keep up
   your reverence to the scriptures. A Seneca may speak things more
   neatly, and to the gust of carnal fancy, but not with greater power and
   efficacy; this is reserved for the word.

   3. It reproves them that undervalue the consolations laid down in the
   word, as if they were but slender, empty, and unsatisfactory, and would
   have some singular and extraordinary way of getting comfort: Job xv.
   11, Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret
   thing with thee?' God's ordinary way is the sure way, the other layeth
   us open to a snare; therefore they who undervalue the ordinary comforts
   of the word, obtained in a way of faith and repentance, and close
   walking with God (as Naaman undervalued the waters of Jordan), and
   would have signs and wonders to comfort them, they may long sit in
   darkness, because if God comfort them not in their way, they will not
   be comforted at all. Now, though God hath sometimes, in condescension
   to his people, granted them their desires--as to Thomas--yet it is with
   an upbraiding of their weakness and unbelief, John xx. 28. We should
   acquiesce in the common allowance of God's people, lest we seem to
   reflect on the wisdom and goodness of God, and lay open ourselves to
   some false consolation and dream of comfort, while we affect new means
   without the compass of the word; especially when we find not our
   expectations there speedily answered, like hasty patients, readier to
   tamper with every new medicine they hear of, than submit to a regular
   course of physic. Gregory tells us of a lady of the emperor's court
   that never ceased importuning him to seek from God a revelation from
   heaven that she should be saved. He answers, Rem difficilem et inutilem
   postulas--it was a thing difficult and unprofitable; difficult for him
   to obtain, unprofitable for her to ask, having a surer way by the
   scriptures, 2 Peter i. 19, than oracles. The adhering of the soul to
   the promises is the unquestionable way to obtain a sound peace. Luther,
   as he confesseth, was often tempted to ask a sign of the pardon of his
   sins, or some special revelation. He tells also how strongly he
   withstood these temptations--Pactum feci cum Domino meo ne mihi mittat
   visiones, vel somnia, vel etiam angelos: contentus enim sum hoc dono,
   quod liabeo scripturam sanctam; quae abunde docet et suppeditat omnia,
   quae necessaria sunt tam ad hanc vitam, quam ad futuram,--I indented
   with the Lord my God, that he would never send me dreams and visions; I
   am well contented with the gift of the scriptures.

   4. It shows how much they are to blame that are under a scripture
   institution and do so little honour it by their patience or comfort
   under troubles. Wherefore were the great mysteries of godliness made
   known to us, and the promises of the world to come, and all the
   directions concerning the subjection of the soul to God, and those
   blessed privileges we enjoy by Christ, if they all be not able to
   satisfy and stay your heart, and compose it to a quiet submission to
   God, when it is his pleasure to take away his comforts from you? Is
   there o balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Will not the whole
   word of God yield you a cordial or a cure? It is a disparagement to the
   provision Christ hath made for our comfort.

   [1.] Surely this comes either from ignorance or forgetfulness; you do
   not meditate in the word, or study the grounds of comfort, and remember
   them: Heb. xii. 5, Have you forgotten the exhortation which. speaks
   unto you as unto children?' Hagar had a well of comfort nigh at hand,
   yet ready to die for thirst.

   [2.] You indulge a distemper, and the obstinacy and peevishness of
   grief: Jer. xxxi. 15, A voice was heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter
   weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, and refused to be comforted.'
   Certainly you do not expostulate with yourselves, and cite your
   passions before the tribunal of reason, Ps. xlii. 5; or else look
   altogether to the grievance, not to the comfort; aggravate the
   grievances, extenuate the comforts; you pitch too much upon temporal
   happiness, would have God maintain you at your own rate: Heb. xiii. 5,
   6, Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with
   such things as you have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor
   forsake thee.' A man must be purged from inordinate affection when he
   would trust in God. Do not pitch too doatingly upon temporal happiness.

   Use 2. Let us get these comforts settled upon our hearts. Was this
   peculiar to David alone? No; every godly man, as Theodoret observeth,
   may say in his trouble, Unless thy word had been my delights, 1 had
   perished in mine affliction. So Daniel when forbidden to pray; so the
   three children in the furnace; all the martyrs; yea, all the afflicted
   servants of God. Therefore let us--

   1. Prize the scripture, and be more diligent in hearing, reading,
   meditating on the blessed truths contained therein. The earth is the
   fruitful mother of all herbs and plants; yet it must be tilled,
   ploughed, harrowed, and dressed, else it bringeth forth little fruit.
   The scripture containeth all the grounds of comfort and happiness, but
   we have little benefit unless daily versed in reading, hearing,
   meditation. Surely if we prize it as we should we would do so: Ps.
   cxix. 97, Oh, how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.'
   There is the only remedy of sin and misery, the offer of true
   blessedness, the sure rule to walk by.

   2. If you would have these comforts, you must get such a spirit of
   application under afflictions: Job v. 27, Lo this, we have searched it,
   so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.' All efficacy is
   conveyed by the touch; the nearer the touch, the greater the power and
   efficacy; bring it down to your hearts: Rom. viii. 31, What shall we
   then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?'

   3. The law of God must be your delight in prosperity, if you would have
   it your support in adversity: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp unto my
   feet, and a light unto my paths.' That which is our antidote against
   our lusts is our best cordial against our passions: 2 Peter i. 4,
   Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises, that by
   these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
   corruption that is in the world through lust.' When afflictions come
   upon you, consider what is your greatest burden and what is your
   greatest comfort, for then you are best at leisure to consider both;
   your greatest burden, that you may avoid it, your greatest comfort,
   that you may apply yourselves to it.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XCVIII.

   I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened
   me.--Ver. 93.

   IN these words observe two things:--

   1. David's thankful resolution, I will never forget thy precepts.

   2. The reason of it, for with them thou hast quickened me.

   First, In his thankful resolution, take notice:--

   1. Of the object, thy precepts.

   2. The duty promised, and negatively expressed, I will never forget.

   1. For the object, Thy precepts:' thereby may be meant the word in
   general; he had found benefit by it, and the word of God should ever be
   dear and precious to him, especially the gospel part of it. Surely that
   is the great means of quickening; that may be comprised in the term,
   thy precepts, if not principally intended; or else most especially some
   particular truth which God had blessed to the use and comfort of his
   soul: I shall never forget that truth, those precepts of thine.

   2. The duty promised, I will never forget.' Forgetting or remembering
   is sometimes taken in scripture for a notional remembrance or notional
   forgetting, when we retain the notions of such a truth, or the notions
   of it vanish out of our minds. And sometimes it is taken practically,
   when we are suitably affected, as the thing or truth remembered
   deserves. Both may be intended; I remember, retain, feel the fruit of
   thy word. That which hath done us good, the very notions of it will
   stick in our minds. Or else it may be for the practical remembrance; so
   it signifies, I will prize, I will cleave fast to it as long as I live.
   To remember is to esteem, and to forget is to neglect; as Heb. xiii.
   16, To do good, and to communicate, forget not;' that is, neglect not.
   I may remember to communicate, yet not perform; but forget not, that
   is, neglect not. In this sense we usually say, You forget me, that is,
   you neglect to do that which I desired of you. So David saith, 1 will
   never forget thy precepts.' The remembrance of his promises is
   effectual and perpetual. It is effectual; for I will remember it, prize
   it, and lay it up in my heart with thankfulness. And it is perpetual; I
   will never;' the Hebrew is, not to all eternity;' I will not forget thy
   precepts for ever,' as we render it fitly.

   Secondly, The reason, For with them thou hast quickened me.' The reason
   is taken from his experience of the benefit of this word; and there we
   have the benefit received, quickening; the author, thou hast quickened;
   the means, with them. God by this means had quickened his soul.

   1. The benefit, quickened. There is a double quickening, when from dead
   we are made living, or when from cold and sad and heavy we are made
   lively. One sort of quickening the word speaks of is when from dead we
   are made living, Eph. ii. 1. Another when from cold, sad, heavy, we are
   made lively, and so not only have life, but enjoy it more abundantly,
   according to Christ's gracious promise, John x. 10, that they may be
   living, lively, kept still in vigour. Now this second quickening may be
   taken either more largely for the vitality of grace, or strictly for
   actual comfort. Largely taken; so God quickens by increasing the life
   of grace, either internally by promising the life of grace, or morally
   and externally by promising the life of glory. More strictly; his
   quickening may be taken for comfort and support in his affliction; so
   it is likely to be taken here: he had said before, ver. 92, immediately
   before the text, Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have
   perished in mine affliction:' and now, I will never forget thy
   precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.' It was great comfort
   and support to him, and therefore he should prize the word as long as
   he lived. This is the benefit received, thou hast quickened me.

   2. Here is the author, thou. God put him, by the inspiration of grace,
   upon the meditation of his word, and then he blessed that meditation;
   his assistance and grace doth all. We receive all degrees of life from
   the fountain of life. The word was the means, but thou hast quickened
   me.

   3. The means, by them; that is, by his precepts; the word was spirit
   and life to him. By the Spirit God makes his word lively in operation,
   and conduceth very much to quickening, comforting, and supporting of
   the saints.

   Doct. Those that have received comfort, life, and quickening by the
   word of God, find themselves obliged to remember it for ever.

   I shall illustrate this proposition by these considerations:--

   1. That God's children are sometimes under deadness.

   2. That in such deadness the word of God is the only means to quicken
   them.

   3. Though the word be quick and lively and powerful, yet it is God that
   must bless it, that must make it a support to the soul.

   4. That whenever we have received these comforts, quickenings, and
   supports from him, they should ever be recorded and treasured up in the
   registers of a thankful memory, for the great uses of Christianity.

   First, God's children are under deadness sometimes, which happeneth to
   them for many causes.

   1. By reason of some sin committed, and not repented of, or not fully
   repented of. God smites them with deadness and hardness of heart, and
   the spiritual life for awhile is greatly obstructed and impaired, that
   it cannot discover itself, and they have not those lively influences of
   grace as formerly. Thus it was with David when he had strayed so
   greatly from God, and begs God not to cast him off: Ps. li. 11, Cast me
   not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.' As a
   wound in the body lets out the life, blood, and spirits, so these
   grievous sins are as a wound in the soul. Sin against the conscience of
   a renewed man defaceth the work of the Holy Spirit, so that for a while
   he seems to be shut out from God's favour, and his gracious abilities
   are lessened and impaired; he is like a wounded man, till he be cured
   and made whole again. The Spirit being grieved and resisted, withdraws,
   and the strength of the soul is wasted; and therefore be very tender,
   stand in awe not only of greater, but smaller sins.

   2. By reason of some good omitted, especially neglect of the means
   whereby we may be kept alive, fresh and lively in God's service. Lazy
   fits of indisposition and omissions of duty do more frequently steal in
   upon believers than positive outbreakings and commissions of sin, and
   they are more ready to please themselves in them, and lie still under
   them, and so by this means contract much deadness of heart. As a lute
   that is not played upon, but hangs by the wall, and not used, it soon
   grows out of keller for want of use; so if we do not diligently and
   constantly exercise ourselves in godliness, our hearts grow dead and
   vain. It is the complaint of the church, Isa. lxiv. 7, There is none
   that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.' If we do not stir up
   ourselves to keep on a constant commerce with God and respect to God,
   alas! deadness creeps upon the heart unawares; and we are commanded,
   anazopurein, 2 Tim. i. 6, To stir up the gift of God which is in us.'
   Surely a slothful servant will soon become an evil servant: Mat. xxv.
   26, Thou evil and slothful servant.' Therefore our sinful sluggishness
   is one cause of our deadness; for he that doth not trade with his
   talents will necessarily become poor: and if we do not continue this
   holy attendance upon God, the heart suffers loss: 1 Thes. v. 19, 20,
   Despise not prophecy; quench not the Spirit.' The coupling of these two
   things together shows, that if we despise prophecy, we quench the
   Spirit; as fire goes out not only by pouring on water, but by not
   stirring and blowing it up. To expect help from God when we are
   sluggish is to tempt Christ, and put him still upon a miraculous way to
   heal and cure our distempers. Who will bring bread and meat to a
   sluggard's bed, who will not arise to labour for it, or will not rise
   at least to fetch it? Therefore, if we will not attend upon God in the
   means of grace, he will not bring us that help, comfort, and supply
   that otherwise we might have. God worketh, but so that we work also:
   Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
   for it is God that worketh,' &c. God's working is not a ground of
   laziness, but for more strict observance. Since all depends upon God,
   therefore take heed you do not offend God, and provoke him to suspend
   his grace. We must not lie upon a bed of ease, and cry, Christ must do
   all; for this is to abuse the power of grace to laziness. It is notable
   that God bids his people do that which he promiseth to give them, Ps.
   xxxi. 24; Ps. xxvii. 14, Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
   your heart.' As if he had said, Strengthen thine heart, and he will
   strengthen thy heart. The courage of faith is both commanded and
   promised. Why? God by this would show how we should shake ourselves out
   of our laziness and idleness; that though God gives us grace and power,
   yet he will have us to work; as a father that lifts up his child's arm
   to a burden, and bids him lift it up. Usually we complain of deadness
   with a reflection upon God; he quickens the dead, and therefore I am
   dead. Ay! but what hast thou done to quicken thyself? for grace was
   never intended that we might be idle. You must complain of yourselves
   as the moral faulty cause; God is the efficient cause. You do not
   meditate, pray, draw life out of the precious promises. When the spouse
   sleeps and keeps her bed, then Christ withdraws, Cant. v. 6.

   3. Another cause is unthankfulness for benefits received, especially
   spiritual benefits; for God loves to have his grace acknowledged. He
   stops his hand, and suspends the influences of his grace, when the
   creature doth not acknowledge his bounty: Col. ii. 7, Be established
   and rooted in the faith, abounding therein with thanksgiving.' The way
   to grow in faith, and get by faith, is to be thankful for what we have
   received; that is an effectual means both to keep it and to get more.
   Therefore if we be always querulous, and do not give thanks for the
   goodness of God to us for what he hath already vouchsafed to us in
   Christ, no wonder that deadness and discouragement creep upon our
   hearts.

   4. Pride in gifts; for we are told, James iv. 6, God resisteth the
   proud, but giveth grace to the humble.' The garland we put on our own
   heads soon withers, and those gifts which we are puffed up with are
   presently blasted, and have deadness upon them; for he will teach us to
   ascribe all to himself.

   5. Some great and heavy troubles. We read, ver. 107 of this psalm, I am
   afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word.' Oh!
   when we are afflicted sore, there is a deadness upon the heart, the
   spiritual life clogged. With what alacrity did they go about good
   things before! But then there is a damp; worldly sorrow deadens the
   spirit, as godly sorrow quickens it, and is a means to keep us alive to
   God.

   6. Another cause is carnal liberty, or intermeddling with worldly
   vanities. So much we may learn from that prayer, Ps. cxix. 37, Turn
   away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way.'
   Oh! when the children of God let loose their minds to vanity, and take
   immoderate liberty in the delights of the flesh, there is a deadness
   comes upon them, for therefore he goes to the cause: Turn away mine
   eyes from beholding vanity.' Immoderate liberty in earthly things, or
   in gratifying the flesh, brings on a deadness upon the heart. The
   Spirit withdraws when the soul is taken off from other comforts, and is
   more addicted to vain pleasures: Jude 19, Sensual, not having the
   Spirit.' As we are enlarged to the flesh, we are straitened to the
   spirit. As sensuality increaseth, so the life and vitality of grace
   decays.

   Secondly, In such cases, the word of God is the only means to quicken
   us. Why the word? For two reasons:--

   1. Because the word contains the most quickening considerations, and
   the affections are wrought upon by serious and ponderous thoughts; for
   there God interposeth in the way of the highest authority, straitly
   charging and commanding us, under pain of his displeasure: and there he
   reasons with us again in the most potent and strong way of
   argumentation, from the excellency of his commands, their suitableness
   to us as we are reasonable creatures; from his great love to us in
   Christ, whom he hath given to die for us; from the danger if we refuse
   him, which is no less than everlasting torment; from the benefit and
   happiness in complying with his motions, which is no less than eternal
   and complete blessedness both for our bodies and souls; and all this is
   bound upon us by a strict day of impartial accounts. Oh, what a company
   of quickening considerations are there, to set us awork with life,
   vigor, and seriousness, when we are to answer for our neglects, or else
   to receive the reward of our diligence! Now what will quicken us if
   this will not? If the high and glorious authority of the supreme
   lawgiver awe us not, if the reasonableness of God's commands invite us
   not, if the wonderful love of God in Christ constrain us not, if the
   joys of heaven do not allure us, and the horrors of ever lasting
   darkness do not preserve upon us a lively sense of our duty, what will
   work upon us if this do not, and gain us to a constant diligent care
   and serious preparation for our own happiness and salvation? Out of
   what rock was the heart of man hewn, that all this shall be brought to
   him in the most persuasive way, as it is in the word of God, and will
   not work upon him? Again, if the deadness should arise from our
   negligence in our duty, the word of God how powerfully doth it quicken
   us! But if the deadness should arise from sorrow and discomfort, is not
   the word as powerful to raise and quicken the soul to a delight in God
   as to inforce our duty? What puts a damp upon us? Is it fury of men? We
   have a living God to trust to, who will remain when they are gone, who
   will pardon our sins, help us in all our straits, who will lay upon us
   no more than we are able to bear, who will never leave us utterly
   destitute, but will sanctify all, and make all work together for the
   best, for our everlasting salvation, and finally bring us into his
   glorious presence, that we may live for ever with him. Here is comfort
   enough, whatever our heaviness be; such a powerful God to stand by us
   in all our troubles, and make all work for good, that at length we may
   be brought home to God. If this word did but dwell richly in our souls,
   it would keep us fresh and lively, and we need not fear man or devil,
   Col. iii. 16. Again, 1 John ii. 14, The word of God abideth in you, and
   ye have overcome the wicked one.' We need fear nothing, for whoever
   trouble us, they are something under God. Whatever is our misery, and
   whatever befalls us, it is something less than hell, which we have
   escaped by Christ, and will all be made up in heaven. The first sight
   of God and the first glimpse of everlasting glory will recompense all
   the sorrows of the present life, and as soon as we step into heaven,
   all shall be forgotten. In short, God's particular providence, fatherly
   love and care, the example of Christ, the promise of the comforting
   Spirit, the hopes of glory, should revive us in all our languishings.
   So that if deadness comes from backwardness and slowness in our duty,
   in the word there are most quickening considerations; or if from
   troubles, we have enough in God, Christ, the covenant, the promise of
   eternal life to support us. This is the first reason; the word of God
   is the only means to comfort us, because it contains proper quickening
   considerations, that may keep life and vigour in us, if either carnal
   distemper invade the heart, or worldly sorrow and fear, which is apt to
   perplex us.

   2. The quickening Spirit delights to work by this means. The ordinary
   chariot, that carrieth the influences of grace, is the word of grace.
   The Spirit that speaks in the word speaks his own lively comforts to
   us. Alas! they are but cold comforts we can find else where. The Spirit
   of God rides most triumphantly in his own chariot. The word and the
   Spirit are often associated, to show they go together. The word goes
   with the Spirit: Isa. lix. 21, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my
   words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart,' &c. Isa. xxx.
   20, when God promiseth, Their eyes shall see their teachers;' it is
   promised also, They should hear a voice behind them, saying, This is
   the way;' God would afford the word and Spirit in times of their
   affliction. The Spirit works still in concomitancy with the word, that
   it may the better be known to be a revelation from God. If God will set
   up a word and revelation of his mind distinct from the light of nature,
   it is fit it should be owned; and that is done by a concomitancy of his
   grace, and powerful operations of his Spirit, that goes along with his
   word: John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.' We
   find the word to be truth, because it is associated and accompanied
   with the operations of the Spirit: 1 Peter i. 22, Ye have purified your
   souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.' The Spirit still goes
   along with the truth of the gospel, and with God's word. His word is
   the sword of the Spirit. God will not bless any other doctrine so much
   as the word to quicken, revive, and comfort the soul; and therefore
   here we should busy ourselves, for it contains the surest grounds of
   comfort, and the Spirit is associated with it, and goes along with it,
   to bless it to our souls.

   Thirdly, Though the word be the means, yet the benefit comes from God,
   for with them thou hast quickened me.' Life comes from the fountain of
   life. The gospel is a sovereign plaster, but it is God's hand that must
   apply it and make it stick, make it to be peace, comfort, and
   quickening to our souls. It is said, 1 Tim. vi. 13, That he that
   quickeneth all things is God.' The quickening of life natural or life
   spiritual is to be ascribed to God alone. Let me evidence this by three
   considerations:--

   1. The life of grace is begun and carried on in a constant way of
   dependence upon God; he will not trust us with a stock of grace in our
   own hands, but our life is in Christ's hands: 1 John v. 12, He that
   hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.'
   He hath it in his own hands, and he gives and conveys it to us. And
   Gal. ii. 20, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' Christ made
   the purchase, and therefore it pleased the Father that the purchased
   treasure should be put into his hands, and not immediately into ours.
   We have so foully miscarried already, that God will trust his honour in
   our hands no more, as at first he did. We have nothing but what we have
   daily from Christ and in Christ: he must influence us, and without him
   we can do nothing: John xv. 5, chori`s emou. Apart from him we can do
   nothing, therefore we cannot quicken our selves; for God hath reserved
   this life of grace, and kept it in his own hands, that we may have our
   daily supplies from Christ.

   2. The vitality or liveliness of grace is not dispensed by a certain
   law, but according to the sovereign will and good pleasure of God. God
   gives life to his people, but the activity of it is only from his good
   pleasure: Phil. ii. 13, For it is God that worketh in you to will and
   to do of (or according to) his good pleasure.' He gives out comfort,
   and he gives degrees of quickening as he pleaseth, to some more, to
   some less, and not always in the same degree to the same persons;
   therefore we must look up unto God if we would have this life and
   quickening; it is very necessary to our well-being, but it is a favour,
   he worketh in us according to his good pleasure.'

   3. The means cannot work without the principal agent. As the word could
   not convert us at first but by the power of God, or as his grace works
   by it, quickening a dead soul, purifying a defiled heart, humbling a
   proud mind; so when the conscience grows sleepy, you need quickening
   excitations to duty. The same grace which caused a spiritual life doth
   give us spiritual strength, and maintain that life, by inclining the
   mind and will, by stirring up the affections by longing desires after
   Christ and glory; so the soul is still kept alive in the same way as it
   was begotten by God at first: 1 Cor. iii. 7, Paul may plant, and
   Apollos may water, but it is God that giveth the increase.' All is of
   God, who only hath the supreme power over men's hearts, to enlighten
   the mind, incline the will, and enlarge the affections. Though we use
   the means (and we sin if we do not), yet it is God that quickeneth us;
   he hath the supreme power over the heart of man.

   Fourthly, These powerful experiences in this kind will be and should be
   recorded and remembered by us; for, saith David, I will never forget
   thy precepts.'

   1. They will be remembered if we have met with any powerful experiences
   of the Lord's quickening and awakening the heart. (1.) We will remember
   what most concerns us. (2.) We will remember all those things which
   make notable impressions upon our souls.

   [1.] Things that concern us will be remembered by us. Every one's
   memory is as his affections are. Let a child read the scripture, that
   chapter wherein mention is made of Joseph's parti-coloured coat, that
   will stick in his mind more than better things, because it suits with
   his childish fancy, and his desires that his parents should make such a
   garment for himself. And it is usually observed that youth is most
   taken with the histories of the Bible, because of their desire to know
   things past. And if once they come to manly age, they are more taken
   with the doctrines of the Bible, because when they grow men they begin
   to form their opinions of religion. And elder persons are taken with
   psalms, and holy devotional strains in scripture, because then, as they
   grow in age, it is time to address themselves to God. Persons in doubts
   and fears by reason of sin will be most affected with tenders of grace,
   as suiting best with their condition; persons in affliction, with the
   consolations appointed for the afflicted; persons in conflict with any
   sin, with those passages which afford most direct help against them.
   Still that which more especially concerns us should and will be most
   observed and remembered by us, for there it speaks to our very hearts.
   Now, saith the soul, in such a point, in such extremity, the word of
   God did my heart good; I shall remember it as long as I live; when a
   seasonable word is spoken to their case; their judgment was not passed
   over by the Lord: I was dead, and it revived me; disconsolate, and it
   comforted me; ready to stray, and it reduced me; under such a
   temptation, and it relieved me. I should transcribe the whole
   scripture, especially the psalms, if I should tell you how often David
   takes notice what the word of God did to him in such and such a
   condition; for still things that nearly concern us, they will affect
   us, and be remembered by us.

   [2.] Those things will be remembered that make any notable impression,
   that leave a lively sense upon the heart; they impress a notice of
   themselves, and will not be forgotten: Luke xxiv. 32, Did not our heart
   burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened
   to us the scriptures?' If opening of the scriptures causeth any burning
   of heart, or any strange workings of soul, when the heat is gone and
   past yet the burning cannot be forgotten; they remembered Christ still,
   and can speak of the actings of the Spirit, not only when they are on,
   but when they are over and past Christ was vanished out of sight and
   gone, yet they cannot forget the warmness of heart they felt while he
   opened the scriptures to them: Cant. v. 4, He put in his hand by the
   hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him;' and ver. 6, My
   soul failed when he spake.' Oh! if we be soundly humbled or soundly
   comforted, or be effectually moved and stirred to the remembrance of
   God, then heavenly things that occasion this will not be forgotten.

   2. These things should be remembered to confirm our faith, to increase
   our love.

   [1.] To confirm our faith. Faith is taken either for a general assent
   to the word, or for a dependence upon God for some blessing that we
   want or stand in need of.

   (1.) If we take it for a general assent to the word, why, these notable
   quickenings and experiences of the convincing or comforting or
   converting power of the word, they are a secondary confirmation of the
   truth of the word to us. I tell you why I put in that word, a secondary
   confirmation; they are not a primary, for we must believe the word
   before we can feel its efficacy and find it to be effectual to us; and
   therefore the primary grounds of faith are the impressions of God upon
   the word, the secondary are the impressions of God upon the heart. Now
   I have felt the virtue and power of the truth upon my soul, and all the
   world shall not draw me from it. I must have a primary confirmation of
   the truth of the word before I can believe, and before it can work in
   me. The apostle saith, 1 Thes. ii. 13, Ye received the word, not as the
   word of man, but as the word of God, which effectually worketh in you
   that believe.' First I receive it as the word of God by some marks, and
   notes, and characters, some impress of God upon his word; some what God
   hath left of himself in the word, and that awes my heart to reverence
   it, there I receive it upon my heart; but when it works in me mightily,
   I have a secondary confirmation. When I have eyes to see the impress of
   God upon the word, then I feel the power of it; and when I have felt
   the power of it, it is confirmed in my soul, 1 Cor. i. 6. When we feel
   the blessed effects, the quickenings and comforts of the word, it is a
   mighty help to faith. So 1 John v. 10, He that believeth on the Son of
   God hath the witness in himself.' What is that witness in himself? Why,
   the witness of the Spirit, applying the blood of Christ to the
   conscience, sanctifying and quickening the heart; then he hath the
   witness in himself, and is more confirmed that Jesus is the Christ, and
   the word of God is true, and cannot easily be divorced from it; he hath
   felt the effects of it in his own heart: Col. i. 5, 6, For the hope
   that is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word
   of the truth of the gospel, and knew the grace of God in truth.' We
   guess at things before, and have but a wavering faith, such as may let
   in some work upon the soul; then we know it in truth, then it is more
   fully made good to us, by the convincing, comforting, and sanctifying
   Spirit, that evidenceth it to our souls, and this can be no other but
   the truth of God; this makes our faith more strong and rooted, and we
   may be confirmed in the hope and belief of the gospel, and may not
   easily be removed therefrom.

   (2.) Take faith in the other notion, for a dependence upon God, for
   something that we stand in need of. Every manifestation of his grace
   should be kept as an experience by us for afterwards, when that frame
   may be away, when God may hide his face, and all dead in the soul; as
   David in his infirmity remembered the years of the right hand of the
   most high,' and former experiences of God, Ps. lxxvii. 10. As he, in an
   outward case, for outward deliverances, remembered the former help and
   succours he had from God, so we may remember former grace and former
   quickening. There are many ups and downs in the spiritual life, for
   even the new creature is changeable, both in point of duty and in point
   of comfort. Now it is a mighty confirmation when we remember what God
   hath done:--

   (1st.) In point of duty. Sometimes you shall find you are dull and
   heartless under the ordinances of God; in reading and hearing you find
   little life, lazy, and almost indifferent, whether you call upon God in
   secret, or hear the word, or join in the communion of saints; no relish
   in any duty, do it almost for custom's sake, or at best but to please
   your consciences: you must do it, and you drive on heavily, not for any
   great need you feel of them, or good you find by them, or hope you
   expect from them. Now it is of great use to remember how I have waited
   upon God formerly, and he hath quickened, refreshed, and comforted me;
   and therefore it is good to try again, to keep up our dependence upon
   his ordinances, when this dulness seizeth upon the soul, and this
   listlessness; when conscience is sleepy, and the heart hangs off from
   God, remember I have been quickened.

   (2d.) If it be in point of comfort, fears and sorrows, why! is there no
   balm in Gilead? no physician there? Hath not God relieved in like
   straits before, and given in fresh consolations, when you have bemoaned
   yourselves and opened your case before him? There are none acquainted
   with the spiritual life but have many experiences both of deadness and
   comfort. Now one is a great help against the other, that our hands may
   not wax faint and feeble. God, that hath comforted, may comfort again,
   and why should I neglect his appointed means? No; I will continue
   there, and lie at the pool where the waters have been stirred.

   [2.] They are of use, again, to stir up our affections to God and his
   word.

   (1.) To increase our love to God. Oh! we should keep the impression of
   his kind manifestation still upon the heart, that the mercy may be
   continually acknowledged. Surely it is a favour that God will manifest
   himself to us, and own us in our attendance upon his word and other
   duties. The Lord Jesus promiseth it as a great blessing: John xiv. 21,
   He that loveth me, and keepeth my commandment, shall be loved of my
   father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.' Now,
   then, when any such sensible favour is vouchsafed to us, we should not
   forget it, but lay it up as a continual ground of thankfulness and love
   to God: Cant. i. 4, We will be glad, and rejoice in thee; we will
   remember thy love more than wine.' When God hath treated us most
   magnificently in his ordinances, either at his table or word, and hath
   refreshed and revived our souls, oh I we will remember this, and lay it
   up for the honour of God, and knit our hearts in a greater love to God.

   (2.) It is of great use to increase our love to the word, for the
   excellency and worth of the word is found experimentally by believers,
   HO that their love and estimation of it is more fixed and settled upon
   their hearts, so that they purpose to make use of it always for their
   comfort and direction; it is a great encouragement when formerly they
   have found comfort and life thereby. The apostle, to settle the
   Galatians that began to waver, that were apt to be overcome by their
   Judaizing brethren, to settle them in love to the gospel, he puts them
   to the question, Gal. iii. 2, This only would I learn of you, Received
   ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?' The
   Spirit of regeneration, with all his comforts and graces, is not
   conveyed to you by the doctrine of the law, but the doctrine of the
   gospel. As if he had said, Stick to that doctrine where you have been
   quickened, comforted, revived, and your hearts settled, for God hath
   owned that doctrine. He appeals to their own conscience, and to their
   own known experience, that they should not quit the doctrine of faith,
   but prize and keep close to it; for surely that which hath been a means
   of be getting grace in our souls should be highly prized by us. If God
   hath wrought grace, and any comfort and peace, stick there, and own God
   there, and be not easily moved from thence. Another apostle reasons,
   James i. 18, 19, God hath begotten us by the word of truth, where fore
   be swift to hear;' that is, Oh! do not neglect hearing; take heed of
   forsaking or neglecting the word, for then you go against your own
   known experience. You know here you had your life, quickening, comfort,
   strength, and will you be turned off from this?--for many times a
   seducer may turn off a believer from the word which hath given him his
   first knowledge of Christ.

   There are three causes which carry saints to the word and other
   ordinances--viz., necessity, natural appetite and inward inclination,
   and experience. Necessity; they cannot live without the word. Natural
   appetite and inward inclination; they have hearts suited to this work;
   the Spirit, which wrought in the heart, hath put a nature in them
   suitable to the work. And experience; they have found benefit by it.
   These are the three grand causes of respect to the word, and they are
   all implied or expressed in that, 1 Peter ii. 2, As new-born babes
   desire the sincere milk of the word,' there is natural appetite for the
   word; we have them come as new-born babes. And there is necessity; you
   cannot live, nor keep, nor increase what you have, unless you keep to
   the word. And there is experience; if so be you have tasted, you have
   had powerful impressions and quickenings by this word. We should engage
   our hearts upon experience, the comfort, life and light that we have
   had by the word of God.

   Our own spiritual estate will sooner be discerned by these experiences,
   the comfort and quickening received from the word, in the way of duty;
   for experience worketh hope,' Rom. v. 4. If your experiences be
   observed and regarded, this works a hopeful dependence upon God for
   everlasting glory; your evidences will be more ready, and sooner come
   to hand. The motions of our souls are various, and, through corruption,
   very confused and dark; and this is that which makes it so difficult
   upon actual search to discern how it stands between us and God; it is
   for want of observation. But now, if there be constant observation of
   what passeth between us and God, how he hath quickened, comforted, and
   owned us in our attendance upon him, and what he hath done to bring on
   our souls in the way of life, these will make up an evidence, and will
   abundantly conduce to the quickening and comforting of our hearts.

   Use 1. For information. It shows us--

   1. The reason why so many neglect and contemn God's word; because they
   never got benefit by it, they find no life in it, therefore no delight
   in it. Those that are quickened acknowledge the mercy and improve it;
   they esteem the word, and have a greater conscience of their duty. It
   is not enough to find truth in truth, not to be able to contradict it,
   but you must find life; then we will prize and esteem it, when it hath
   been lively in its operations to our souls.

   2. It shows the reason why so many forget the word, because they are
   not quickened. You would remember it by a good token if there were a
   powerful impression left upon your souls; and the reason is, because
   you do not meditate upon it, that you may receive this lively influence
   of the Spirit: for a sermon would not be forgotten, if it had left any
   lively impression upon your souls.

   3. If we want quickening we must go to God for it; and God works
   powerfully by the influence of his grace, and so he quickens us by his
   Spirit; and he works morally by the word, both by the promises and
   threatenings thereof: and so, if you would be quickened, you must use
   the means, attend upon reading and preaching, and meditating upon the
   word. As he works powerfully with respect to himself, so morally by
   reasonings.

   Use 2. By way of reflection upon ourselves.

   Have we had any of these experiences? David found life in God's word,
   therefore resolves never to forego it or forget it. Therefore, what
   experience have you had of the word of God? s Surely at least at first
   conversion there was the work of faith and repentance, at first you
   will have this experience. How were you brought home to God? What I
   have you had no quickening from the word of God?

   Case. But here is a case of conscience: Doth every one know their
   conversion, or way of their own conversion? Christians are usually
   sensible of this first work. There is so much bitter sorrow, and
   afterwards so much rejoicing of hope which doth accompany, that surely
   this should not be strange. But though you have not been so wary to
   mark God's dealings with you, and the particular quickenings of your
   souls, yet at least when the Lord raised you out of your security, and
   brought you home to himself, you should have remembered it: 1 Thes. i.
   9, They themselves show of us what manner of entering we had unto you.'
   The entrance usually is known, though afterward the work be carried on
   with less observation. Growth is not so sensible as the first change.
   God's first work is most powerful, meets with greater opposition, and
   so leaves a greater feeling upon us; and therefore it were strange if
   we were brought home to Christ, and no way privy and conscious to the
   way of it, as if all were done in our sleep. I say, to think so were to
   give security a soft pillow to rest on. And therefore, what quickenings
   had you then? Can you say, Well, I shall never forget this happy season
   and occasion, when God first awakened me to look after himself? Many of
   God's children cannot trace the particular footsteps of their
   conversion, and mark out all the stages of Christ's journey and
   approach to their souls, for all are not alike thus troubled. But yet,
   that men may not please themselves with the supposition of imaginary
   grace wrought in them without their privity and knowledge, let me speak
   to this grand case, this manner of entrance of Christ into our souls,
   how we are quickened from the dead and made living.

   1. None are converted but are first convinced of their danger and evil
   estate; God's first -work is upon their understandings: Jer. xxxi. 19,
   After I was instructed I smote upon the thigh,' &c. There is some light
   breaks in upon the soul which sets them seriously a considering, What
   am I? whither am I going? what will become of me? And Rom. vii. 9, When
   the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.' The commandment, the
   law of God, breaks in with all its terrors and curse upon the soul by
   strong conviction, and the man is given for gone, lost and dead. You
   know the way to the bowels is by the mouth and the stomach, and so by
   other passages. There is no way to the affections but by the ear, then
   to the understanding, and then passeth to the apprehension, the
   judgment, and conscience, and heart; from the apprehension to the
   grammatical knowledge, then they come to the judgment, then to the
   conscience; and when conscience is set awork, usually there is some
   feeling.

   2. Conviction, where it is strong and serious, where it is not levis et
   niollis, it cannot be without some compunction. The eye affects the
   heart. Can a man be sensible of a lost condition, and of the necessity
   of a change, without being troubled at it, without making a serious
   weighty business of it? Are heaven and hell such slight matters that a
   man can think of the one or the other without any commotion of
   heart?--(pray do but bethink yourselves; I shall solve the particular
   cases, but I must establish the general one) especially if he be
   convinced of his being obnoxious to one, and doth not know whether he
   shall have the other, yea or nay? Certainly whoever is instructed or
   convinced will smite upon his thigh and bemoan himself as Ephraim, Jer.
   xxxi. There is none ever came to Christ, the spiritual physician, but
   they were in some degree heart-sick; none ever came for ease but they
   felt a load upon their back. If there be conviction and compunction,
   this will be felt.

   3. But then the degrees are various, some are more, some less, some
   earnestly solicitous, or deeply in horror. Some are brought to God by
   the horrors of despair, and are convinced with a higher and more smart
   degree of sorrow, before ever they come to settle; but all are serious
   and anxious. There is certainly a difference; some men's conversion is
   more gentle, others more violent. To some, Christ comes like an armed
   man, and doth powerfully vanquish Satan in their hearts; to others,
   there is a great deal of difficulty and conflict, which must needs
   impress a notice of itself. Some are sweetly drawn, others are snatched
   out of the fire. To some the Spirit comes with a mighty rushing wind,
   to others by a gentle blast, sweetly and softly blows open the door.
   God opened the heart of Lydia; we read of no more, Acts xvi. 14. But
   when he comes to the jailer, he had more horror of conscience, and more
   sorrow and desperation, and was ready to kill himself, saying, What
   shall I do to be saved?' ver. 31. The Lord bids us to put a difference,
   to have compassion of some, and to pluck others more violently out of
   the fire, Jude 23. So here, the Lord's work is various, it is to some
   more gentle, but to others it is with a greater horror.

   4. I answer--That no certain rule can be given as to this different
   dispensation, why some are so gently used, and others so violently
   brought home to God. Sometimes they which have had good education, and
   less errors of life, have less terrors of heart, as being restrained
   from gross sins; at other times they have had most terrors, because
   they have withstood so many means, and because they do not know when
   God works upon them. Sometimes those which are called to greatest
   services have had most terrors, that they may speak more of the evil of
   sin, having felt the bitterness of it: 2 Cor. v. 11, Knowing the terror
   of the Lord, we persuade men.' Sometimes it is quite otherwise; they
   which have been called to some eminent public service for God may not
   drink so deeply of this cup, but are spared, that they may be kept more
   entire for their public work, which serves instead of sorrow and
   trouble of conscience. Again, sometimes men and women of most excellent
   and acute understandings are most humble, as having clearest
   apprehensions of the heinousness of sin and terror of wrath. At other
   times, on the contrary, these horrors and fears come from ignorance, as
   fears arise in the dark, and weak spirits are apt to be terrified, and
   have a knowledge of the remedy as soon as they know their disease; the
   work may be more gentle. Sometimes these terrors fall on a strong body,
   as being best able to bear them; sometimes on a weak, the devil taking
   advantage of their weaknesses and manifold infirmities. Many times in
   hot and fiery natures their changes are sudden, carried on with
   extremities; but sometimes soft natures, whose motions are slow and
   gentle, by degrees are surprised, and impressions of grace are made
   insensibly. Thus God acts as he will, but in the general all are
   serious and solicitous.

   5. Because no certain rule can be given, the measure must not be looked
   after, but the effects; we are not so much to look to the deepness of
   the wound, as the soundness of the cure. The means only respect the
   end, therefore the end must be considered; and many times the effects
   are visible and more evident in fruit and feeling. Now, if we give
   sound proof that we are converted, I am contented. If the work be done,
   that sufficeth, which way soever it be done, though usually it is done
   by some notable and powerful impression upon the heart. Look, as the
   blind man said, John ix. 25, Which way my eyes were opened I know not;
   but this I know, that whereas I was blind, I now see.' So if the
   renewed soul can say, How the work was done, I cannot tell; I have been
   waiting upon God, and have felt the fruits of his grace upon my heart.

   6. The effects of this first work are these:--

   [1.] A hearty welcoming of Christ Jesus into the soul; they do not take
   up with comfort on this side Christ. Men's troubles are known by their
   satisfaction. If honour satisfied men, then disesteem and disrespect
   were their trouble, however they did palliate it with religious
   pretences. If riches satisfied men, then poverty pinched them. If the
   prosperity of the world satisfied men, it was worldly adversity was
   their trouble, though it crept under religious pretences. But if we see
   the necessity of a saviour, receive him into our hearts, and believe in
   him with all our heart's desire, and delight, and all is carried after
   Christ and after the refreshings of his grace, and are satisfied with
   none but Christ, and our hearts pant for him as the hart panteth after
   the water-brooks,' you ought to bless God that he hath left the
   impression of the effect, though he hath not left the impression of the
   way, Ps. xlii. 1. But now, when desires after Christ are either none at
   all, or cold and faint, and easily put out of the humour, and only
   provoke you now and then to put up a cold prayer, or express a few
   faint wishes or heartless sighs; that though you have a desire after
   Christ, yet it is easily diverted, and controlled by other and higher
   desires, and you can be satisfied, and take up with something beneath
   Christ, and Christ is not the precious and only one of your souls, you
   have not that impression which amounts to a hearty work.

   [2.] Another impression is a thorough hatred of sin, and serious
   watchfulness and striving against it; when you seek to cast it out of
   your soul with indignation, Hosea xiv. 8; to hate every false way,' Ps.
   cxix. 104; when you are continually groaning under it, Rom. vii. 24,
   and seek to weaken it more and more; for they that are Christ's, have
   crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts thereof,' Gal. v.
   24. This is a sensible impression left upon the soul.

   [3.] A lively diligence in the spiritual life. Though you cannot tell
   how God brought you in, yet if you keep up a lively diligence in
   serving God, and with the twelve tribes instantly serving God day and
   night,' Acts xxvi. 7, and you are always working out your own salvation
   with fear and trembling,' Phil. ii. 12, and you are hard at work for
   God; if this holy care be the constant business and drift of your
   lives, you have the effect of this conversion, though the first
   impression of it not so sensible.

SERMON XCIX.

   I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.--Ver. 94.

   IN these words you have--(1.) David's plea, I am thine. (2.) His
   request, save me. (3.) His argument to make good his plea, I have
   sought thy precepts. His plea is taken from God's interest in him, I am
   thine.' His request is for safety, to be saved either from wrath to
   come or from temporal danger, rather the latter; for he seeth trouble
   lie in wait for him, therefore save me.' And then the evidence of that
   interest, which may serve as an argument to set on the request, I have
   sought thy precepts.'

   Let me speak of these in their order, and first of David's plea, I am
   thine.'

   Doct. 1. That God hath a special people in the world, whom he will own
   for his.

   David, as one of this number, saith to God, I am thine.' By a common
   right of creation all things are God's: 1 Chron. xxix. 11, Heaven and
   earth is thine, and all that is therein.' He made all, and therefore by
   a just right he is lord of all: Ps. xxiv. 1, The earth is the Lord's,
   and the fulness thereof.' Now, as to this general right, God is no more
   bound to one than to another; there is no great privilege in this to be
   God's in this sense, for so are the cattle upon a thousand hills, as we
   are his by creation. We cannot say with David, I am thine; save me;'
   for he that made them will not save them, if they have no other title
   and interest in him, Isa. xxiii. 11. Thus by creation all things are
   God's, but more especially men: Ezek. xviii. 4, All souls are mine.'
   God hath a peculiar interest in the reasonable creatures, as their
   maker, governor, and judge. And yet further, his church is his by
   general profession; all the members of the visible church may say,
   Lord, we are thine; and that is some kind of plea for their safety and
   protection: Isa. lxiii. 19, We are thine; thou never barest rule over
   them, they were not called by thy name.' So may all the members of the
   visible church speak to God. Yet more particularly there is a remnant
   in the world that are his by a nearer interest, and they are the saints
   or new creatures, who are his peculiar people, Titus ii. 14, lao's
   periou'sios. All the world else are but as the lumber of the house, but
   these are his treasure. A man is more chary of his treasure than of his
   lumber; yea, they are his jewels,' Mal. iii. 17, precious and dear to
   him, and of special interest in his heart and affection; they are the
   first-fruits of his creatures,' James i. 18. The first-fruits were the
   Lord's portion. Now these God doth peculiarly take to be his portion,
   and valueth them more than all the world besides.

   Let us see the grounds of his special interest in them; wherefore are
   they his?

   He hath elected them before all the world: John xvii. 6, Thine they
   were, and them thou gavest me.' They were his by eternal election and
   choice, and they are purchased and bought by Christ, therefore called a
   purchased people, bought with a price, 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, and upon this
   ground they are said to be Christ's, 1 Cor. iii. 23. Now, as they are
   Christ's and God's by purchase, they are also his by conquest and
   rescue from Satan. Prisoners in war belong to the conqueror, Luke xi.
   21. The strong man that holdeth captive the carnal part of the world,
   they are his goods; but the stronger than he shall come and bind him
   and take away his goods. They were Satan's, but by rescue and conquest
   the prey falls to Christ: Col. i. 13, Who hath delivered us from the
   power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.'
   Once more, they are his by effectual calling and work of his grace:
   Eph. ii. 10, We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works,' &c. So the title is changed by the right of the new creation.
   Again, they are his by covenant; we choose him to be our God, and the
   Lord chooseth us to be his peculiar people, Hosea ii. 23. They
   acquiesce in him as their all-sufficient portion, and surrender and
   give up themselves to his use and service. This is that which is
   chiefly intended here, namely, that we are his by contract and
   resignation; for so David saith, Lord, I am thine.' All this doth
   abundantly make good God hath a special people in the world whom he
   will own for his. The grace by which we are inclined to resign up
   ourselves to God, that flows from election, through the redemption of
   Christ, by sanctification of the Spirit; but the grounds, reasons, and
   motives for which we dedicate ourselves to God, they are his right in
   us by creation and redemption. It is but fit God should have what he
   hath made and bought; we are his creatures, his purchase, therefore we
   are his.

   Use 1. For trial. Are we of the number of God's peculiar people? As
   David paid to the Egyptian, To whom belongest thou? whence art thou?' 1
   Sam. xxx. 13. So, if the question should be put to you, Whence are you?
   to whom do you belong? Can you answer, Lord, I am thine.' I belong to
   thee? If it be so, then:--

   1. When did you solemnly dedicate yourselves to him? If you be God's,
   can you remember when you first took your oath of allegiance to him?
   There is a solemn time of avouching one another, when God avouched you
   to be his people, and you avouched God to be your God: Deut. xxvi. 17,
   18, Thou hast avouched this day the Lord to be thy God, and to walk in
   his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and judgments,
   and to hearken to his voice: and the Lord hath avouched thee this day
   to be his peculiar people.' When did you give up the key of your hearts
   to God, and lie at God's feet, and say, Lord, here I am, what wilt thou
   have me to do?' Acts ix. 6. They that are God's come in this way, by
   resignation or spiritual contract, by entering into covenant with him.

   2. What have you that is peculiar? Have you the favour of his people?
   Have you the conversation of his people? God's peculiar people have
   peculiar mercies; at least their hearts and spirits are carried out
   after them: Ps. cvi. 4, Lord, remember me with the favour of thy
   people.' Common mercies will not serve their turn, but they must have
   renewing and sanctifying mercies, and special pledges of his love; not
   increase of estate, honour, or esteem in the world; these are not
   things their hearts run upon; but, Lord, the favour of thy people; or,
   Ps. cxix. 132, Do good unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that
   love thy name.' There is a goodness which God vouchsafeth to all his
   creatures; to the men of the world he gives a plentiful portion; their
   bellies are filled with thy hid treasure; but, Lord, let me have the
   comforts of thy Spirit, the manifestations of thy love and good-will to
   my soul in Christ Jesus. As Luther said and protested, God should not
   put him off with gold nor with honours; I must have his grace, his
   Christ, his Spirit; Valde protestatus sum me nolle his satiari. If you
   have such peculiar spirits, your hearts would be carried out after
   these distinguishing mercies. A man may have common mercies and go to
   hell and be cast away; but God's peculiar people have peculiar mercies;
   then they will not be contented with a common conversation: Mat. v. 47,
   If you love them that love you, what do you more than others?' There is
   ti' perisso`n, something over and above, that should be seen in a
   Christian's life. It is a fault, 1 Cor. iii. 3, Ye walk as men.' In the
   new creature there should be something more excellent. God's peculiar
   people, as there is a difference between them and others in point of
   privileges, so also in point of conversation; they should live at a
   higher rate, more heavenly, meek, mortified, more charitable than
   others. Christians should walk so as to convince the world, and make
   them wonder at the beauty, majesty, and strictness of their lives. You
   harden carnal men when you profess yourselves to be God's peculiar
   people, and there is no difference between you and others.

   3. Doth your resignation appear in your living and acting for God? Is
   holiness to be written in visible characters upon all you do? Zech.
   xiv. 19, 20. The impress of God is upon his people, it is upon the
   horse bells, upon all the pots of Jerusalem; it is upon all they have,
   all they enjoy, Holiness to the Lord:' they spend their time as being
   dedicated to God, they spend their estates as being dedicated to God.
   Do you use yourselves as those that are Christ's, improving your time,
   relations, talents, interests for his glory? This may be discovered
   partly by checking temptations upon this account: 1 Cor. vi. 15, Shall
   I take the members of Christ, and make them to be the members of an
   harlot?' This body is Christ's, and therefore must be kept in
   sanctification and in honour; this time I misspend, this estate is
   Christ's; and so you dare not give way to the folly and sin with which
   others are transported, for you look upon all that you have as
   Christ's. And so also are your contrivances and projects for God's
   glory; you will be casting about how you may honour Christ by your
   estate and relations, and everything you have: Neh. i. 11, Grant me
   mercy in the sight of this man: for I was the king's cup-bearer:' that
   is, he was considering what use he might make of this authority and
   esteem which he had with the king of Babylon, and what use he might
   make of it for God. God hath advanced me to such honour and place; what
   honour hath God had? Look, as David, 2 Sam. xvii. 2, I dwell in a house
   of cedar, and the ark of God dwells within curtains.' Here the Lord
   hath abundantly provided for me, but what have I done for God? When you
   are in all things seeking the things of God, and laying out yourselves
   for the glory of God, and if God needs anything that is yours, you
   freely and willingly part with it.

   Use 2. To persuade us to resign up ourselves to God, and to live as
   those that are God's.

   First, To resign up ourselves to God: Isa, xliv. 5, One shall come and
   say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the name of
   Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and
   surname himself by the name of Israel.' Come and subscribe to the God
   of Jacob, give it under hand and seal, enter your names in his
   muster-roll, that you are one of his subjects and servants. Motives are
   these:--

   1. You owe yourselves to God, and therefore should give up yourselves
   to him: Philem. 19, Thou owest unto me even thine own self.' It is true
   with respect to God; thou owest all that thou hast to him, thou hast
   nothing but what he gave thee first. God calls it a gift, My son, give
   me thy heart:' but it is indeed a debt, for God gave it, not to
   dispossess himself and divest himself, but gave it for his use and
   service. He gave you yourselves to yourselves, as a man gives an estate
   to a factor to trade with, or as a husbandman scatters his seed upon
   the ground, not to bury it there, but expecting a crop from thence. So
   God scatters his gifts abroad in the world, gives life and all things;
   not to establish a dominion in thy person, but only a stewardship and a
   course of service. Hast thou life? Man is not dominus vitae, but
   custos--not lord of his life, but only the guardian and keeper for God.
   Now what is said of life is true of estates and all things else; there
   is no proper dominion we have.

   2. God offers himself to thee, and therefore it is but reasonable thou
   give up thyself to God. In the covenant there is a mutual engaging
   between God and the creature to be each other's, according to their
   several capacities; I will be their God, and they shall be my people.'
   The great God, Quantus quantus est, totus noster est, as great as he
   is, lie becomes ours; all in him ours, his wisdom, power, strength;
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are our everlasting portion. God the Father
   will be our portion for ever, he will give his Son to be our redeemer,
   and his Spirit to be our guide; all the persons, with all their power
   and strength, are engaged for our use. Look, as when Jehoshaphat made a
   league with the king of Israel, this was the manner of it: 1 Kings
   xxii. 4, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
   horses.' They mutually made over their strength one to another. So when
   God offereth to make over himself to us, this is the tenor, I will be
   for thee, and thou shalt be for me,' as Hosea iii. He makes over
   himself with all that is his. Now, when God offers to make over himself
   to us, and all that belongs to him to our use, his strength, power, and
   love, shall we stand demurring upon so blessed a contract, and not give
   up ourselves to the Lord? God, that needs us not, will engage himself
   to us to be for us, if we will be for him. Oh, then, let us resign up
   ourselves, and put ourselves under the power and sovereignty of God!

   3. You never enjoy yourselves so much as when you give up yourselves to
   God; it is not your loss, but your gain; it is a kind of receiving: for
   you give up yourselves to become his people, to be sanctified, to be
   preserved by his grace, and governed by his Spirit; and all these are
   privileges, they are rather a gift for us. For a beggar to give up
   herself to match with a prince, she gets by giving; you give up your
   hearts to God to be better. Other things that are dedicated to God are
   only altered in their use, as gold and silver dedicated to the
   sanctuary; but when a man is given to God, he is altered in his nature,
   he is governed and fitted for God's use. If there be any pretence of
   loss, it is this, a right or power to live according to your own will.
   Ay! but that you never had by virtue of your creation. You are bound to
   live according to the will of God; God's precepts bind as a law where
   they are not received as a covenant; and therefore you have no power to
   dispose yourselves; you are God's, whether you give up yourselves to
   him or no. When you consider how much you gain, you are interested in
   all the privileges of the Lord's grace; it not only establisheth your
   duty, but your comfort and encouragement. If there were nothing but
   this free leave to go to God in all our straits and dangers, I am
   thine, save me,' this were a benefit not to be valued. If God be yours,
   you may expect salvation, temporal, eternal; therefore the benefit of
   this gift is not God's, but ours; you give up yourselves, not to bring
   aught to God, but receive from God.

   4. You cannot give other things to him unless you give up yourselves to
   him. 2 Cor. viii. 4, it is rendered as a reason of their forwardness in
   a good work, They first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us
   by the will of God.' When a man hath given himself to God, all things
   else will succeed more easily in the spiritual life; as a woman and man
   in the conjugal relation, they are easily kind one to another when they
   have bestowed themselves one upon another. As Quintus Fabius Maximus,
   answering to the ambassador that offered him gold, that it was not the
   fashion of the Romans to have gold under their power, but they were
   under a power that were owners and possessors of their gold. Apply it;
   the first thing God looks after is the person.

   5. It is your honour to be in relation to God, therefore give up
   yourselves: Ps. cxvi. 16, O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy
   servant, and the son of thy handmaid.' He repeats it thrice, as if he
   were wonderfully pleased with the relation. Mean offices about a prince
   are accounted honourable in the world; so to be in the meanest degree
   of service about God is a great honour; therefore give up yourselves to
   God.

   Secondly, Live as those that are God's. The first thing we should do is
   to determine whose we are, then to make good that relation. You are not
   your own, that is clear, 1 Cor. vi. 19; therefore not to live to your
   own will, your own ends, your own interest. All the disorder that is in
   the world comes from a man's looking upon himself as his own: Ps. xii.
   4, Our tongues are our own:' and therefore they take liberty to speak
   what they please. And saith Nabal, My bread and my wine.' When we are
   so eager to establish our own dominion and propriety, then we miscarry.
   As Bernard saith, Horreo quicunque de meo ut sim meus--we should be in
   utter detestation of living to ourselves, and rather be God's bondmen
   than our own freemen. And as they are not their own, so not the
   world's: John xv. 19, Because ye are not of the world, therefore the
   world hates you.' The world hates the godly because they have other
   principles and other ends. You should not conform to the world in
   judgment or practices, for you are not of the world; you are not of the
   flesh: Rom. viii. 12, We are not debtors to the flesh:' therefore this
   should not be your care and study to pamper and please the flesh. You
   are not Satan's, for you are taken out of his power, Col. i. 13. Whose
   are you? You are the Lord's; therefore your business should be to
   please God and honour God. It is easy to say, I am thine; do we make it
   good in our practice? This may be known two ways:--

   1. When we make his glory to be the scope of our lives: Phil. i. 21, To
   me to live is Christ:' that is my business and employment, not to seek
   my own things, but the things of Christ Jesus. Do you give up
   yourselves to be governed and ordered by his Spirit, acting and living
   for his glory?

   2. When we walk so as God may own us with honour; take his law for our
   rule, as well as to fix his glory for our scope. Exod. xxxii. 7, saith
   God to Moses, Thy people whom thou hast brought up out of Egypt:' thy
   people; God would not own them when they had corrupted their ways. We
   would say to God, Lord, I am thine; but alas! we act not as the Lord's,
   but as if we were of the flesh, as if we belonged to Satan, to lust,
   and passion, and anger; by those cursed influences are we acted and
   swayed in our conversations. It is as sweet an argument and as forcible
   a reason as you can use to God in prayer to say, Lord, I am thine, if
   we could use it in good conscience, saith Chrysostom. All men are so,
   but how few can thus speak to God; for, saith he, his servants you are
   whom you obey; and the servant of sin lieth when he saith, I am thine.
   Alas! most every kind of sin may say, Thou art mine; lust and
   covetousness and ambition may challenge us. It is not words, but
   affections and actions that must prove us to be the Lord's; then we are
   his when we seek to please him in all things. Judas was Christ's in
   profession, but the devil's in affection. David saith, I am thine,' but
   presently adds, I seek thy precepts,' I endeavour to do thy will. Oh!
   then, live not as your own, as of Satan and the flesh, but as the
   Lord's.

   Let us come to the ground of his plea, Save me.' David doth not say,
   Thou art mine, save me,' but, I am thine.' These two are correlates; he
   that speaks the one speaks both; if we be God's, God is ours: I am my
   beloved's, and my beloved is mine:' and yet David saith, I am thine,'
   but doth not say, Thou art mine, for four reasons:--

   1. Because this is first in our apprehension. We know God to be ours by
   giving up ourselves to be his. His choice and election of us is a
   secret till it be evidenced by our choice of him, till we choose him
   for our portion. Well, then, a believer cannot always say God is his,
   but a believer is always resolved to be the Lord's by his own choice
   and dedication; they resolve to be his, and not their own. Though you
   cannot discern your election, that God hath chosen you, yet it is
   comfortable to renew your resignation of yourselves to God.
   Resignation, that is our act, and is more sensible to conscience than
   God's election: Lord, I have none in heaven but thee, and whom do I
   desire in comparison of thee?' God will not refuse such a soul that is
   thus willing to tack himself upon God, will not be put off: I am
   thine.' As the Campani, when they begged the Romans to help them, and
   they refused, they came and gave themselves and their whole estates to
   be vassals to the Romans, with this plea, If you will not defend us as
   your allies, defend us as your subjects. Thus a gracious soul will tack
   himself upon God, and will not be put off: I will not be my own, but
   thine.

   2. I am thine:' he saith so, because this was the best check to the
   present temptation. David was then in fear of his life when he spoke
   this, when the wicked lay in wait to destroy him, ver. 95; they wanted
   neither malice nor power to do it; then saith David, I am thine.' In
   afflictions God seems to break down the hedge, and lay his people open,
   in common with others, to the fury of the judgment that is then upon
   them. In regard of God's outward dealings, little appearance different
   between us and them; but then we must say, Lord, I am thine; though
   involved in the same judgment, yet, Lord, thou canst put a difference,
   I am thine.' 2 Peter ii. 9: The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out
   of temptation,' how to put a distinction and difference between his own
   and others; so that our distinct interest, I am thine,' is a relief to
   the soul.

   3. Saints observe a difference when they speak to God and when they
   plead with their own hearts; when they speak to God, then they mention
   their own resignation, Lord, I am thine; but when they would revive
   their own drooping souls, then they say, God is mine. Compare the text
   with Ps. xlii. 11, Why art thou cast down, O my soul?' &c. He is my
   God; God is mine, and wilt thou be troubled? But when they speak to
   God, I am thine:' so they raise their hearts in a holy confidence. The
   interest is mutual. In dealing with our own unbelief, it is best to
   urge our interest in God: He is mine; but when in prayer, God's
   interest in us: Lord, I am thine.

   4. This is the more humbling way, to urge our own resignation. See Ps.
   cxvi. 15, 16, Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his
   saints;' then presently, Ah, Lord, truly I am thy servant,' &c. God's
   children may be exposed to hazards alike, but their blood is precious
   to God. Now though the world thinketh lightly of their death, yet God
   doth not think so. How doth David apply this comfort, Precious in the
   sight,' &c. He doth not say, as the force of the words would seem to
   carry it, Lord, I am one of thy saints; but, Lord, I am thy servant; he
   takes a more humble title. There is many a man fears and doubts to
   apply the privileges of God's children under some higher title, yet
   they should apply them in a title suitable to their condition and
   measure. So did David; he presumeth not to say, Thou art mine; that
   were a higher challenge, but yet such as God's condescension will
   warrant him; but he doth aver and assert his own resignation, which is
   a more dutiful and humble way of confidence. Again, he doth not. say, I
   am thus and thus, but, I am thine. He doth not plead property or good
   qualification, but he pleads God's property in him; Lord, I cannot say
   I am perfect and upright as I should be, yet I am thine. It is good to
   own God in the humbling way, and take hold of promises on the dark
   side; so doth Paul, 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a faithful saying,' &c.; as
   if he had said, Nay, if that be a faithful saying, then I can put in a
   plea, I am sinner enough for Christ to save. Thus by these lower ways
   of application we may derive and take out to ourselves the comfort of
   the promises.

   Doct. 2. God's interest in his people is the ground of his care for
   their safety.

   It may be pleaded as a ground of his care for their safety, Lord, I am
   thine, and therefore save me; this is David's plea in a time of danger.
   And so Christ, when he was to leave his disciples to the troubles of a
   furious opposite world, how doth he plead for them! John xvii. 6, Thine
   they were, and thou gavest them me; therefore keep them through thine
   own name.' We may pray to God with more confidence for our safety in a
   time of danger when we can plead his interest in us.

   How doth his interest prove a ground of confidence and plea for prayer
   in a time of danger?

   1. God's knowledge of them: 2 Tim. ii. 19, The Lord knows those that
   are his.' He hath a particular exact knowledge of all the elect, and
   who they are that shall be saved; they are engraven as it were upon the
   palms of his hands; he takes notice of them, and of the condition in
   which they are: John x. 3, He calleth his own sheep by name.' Christ
   knows them by head and poll.

   2. His care over them and his affection to them. Interest in general is
   a very endearing thing. That which is mine doth more affect me than
   that which is another man's: 1 Tim. v. 8, He that careth not, and
   provideth not for his own, is worse than an infidel.' It is an
   unnatural thing for a man not to affect his own; and will God suffer
   that which is his own to be snatched out of his hands, and used by evil
   men according to their pleasure? A man is careful of his own children,
   to dispose of them in a safe place, and careful of his own jewels: the
   saints are not as God's lumber, but as his jewels; they are dearer to
   God than all things else: Isa. xliii. 3, 4, I am the Lord thy God, thy
   saviour; I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee; since
   thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have
   loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy
   life;' that is, if the sword must drink blood, let it go to Seba and
   Ethiopia, to Arabia, and to Egypt; he strikes the king of Assyria in
   his wrath, and the sword shall be diverted that way, rather than they
   should be given up to be destroyed. But this is not all. The way how we
   come to be his own doth exceedingly endear us to him; as, for instance,
   we come to be God's by eternal election; now this must needs endear us
   to God. A woman that carries her child in her womb but nine months,
   what a tender affection hath she to it! Isa. xlix. 14, 15, Can a woman
   forget her sucking child?' &c.; Eph. i. 4, He chose us from the
   foundation of the world.' We lay in the womb of his decree from all
   eternity, and therefore we are very dear to God, namely, as we are his
   by election. Again, as we are his by redemption; they were bought with
   a dear price, therefore they are a precious people; God hath a high
   esteem and value for them. That which cost dear, we will not lose it
   lightly. The saints are valuable, not so much in themselves, as in
   Christ, by whose precious blood they are purchased with God, 1 Peter i.
   18. Adam sold us for a trifle, but Christ did not redeem us at a cheap
   rate. Then the work of the Spirit, who hath drawn the image of God upon
   us; God will not suffer his own work to be destroyed, Ps. lxxiv. 6.
   They came to God, and complained of the defacing of the material
   temple, that the carved work, the curious work which was wrought by the
   special direction of God's own Spirit, was destroyed (for the Spirit of
   God directed Bezaleel to work in brass and all manner of curious
   works); certainly the temples of the Holy Ghost, which are formed for
   God's praise, God will not suffer them to be destroyed and never look
   after them. Again, as they are God's by dedication, so they are dear to
   him. Common gold and silver was not so valued as consecrated gold and
   silver. Goat's-hair that was consecrated to the uses of the temple was
   more excellent than all other things that was for common use. We are
   dedicated, consecrated to God, set apart for himself: Ps. iv. 3, The
   Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself.'

   3. He hath a peculiar eye to his own. Why? Because he expects more work
   from them than from others, therefore they have more protection; God is
   known, glorified and owned among them. His revenues to the crown of
   heaven from the world come to little in regard of what he hath from his
   people and his church: Ps. cxlv. 10, All thy works shall praise thee, O
   Lord, and thy saints shall bless thee.' God hath most of his praise
   from his saints. His creatures show forth his glory, but his saints
   bless him. The common sort of people smother the glory of God in their
   atheism, security, and unbelief; but those only are the people that
   keep up his praise in the world, therefore he preserves them.

   4. Because by covenant all that is God's is theirs, for their use. His
   strength is theirs: Eph. vi. 10, Be strong in the Lord, and in the
   power of his might.' And his salvation is theirs: Ps. lxviii. 20, He
   that is our God is the God of salvation.' If God be a God of salvation,
   he is our God. If he hath salvation to bestow, it is ours. A believer
   hath full right to make use of all that God hath.

   Use 1. To press you to get this interest in times of danger. We should
   now be more careful than at other times to get and clear up our
   interest in God. Oh, it will be no advantage to say, This and that is
   mine, but a great advantage to say, God is mine. When desolations are
   on the earth, there is great havoc made of great estates, and outward
   supplies will come to nothing; but this will be an ever lasting comfort
   to say, God is mine. See 1 Sam. xxx. 6, But David comforted himself in
   the Lord his God;' Hab. iii. 18, I will rejoice in the Lord; I will joy
   in the God of my salvation.'

   2. It presseth you to make your interest more evident by fruits of
   obedience; as David, I am thine.' How makes he it good? I sought thy
   precepts.' We would have mercy, but neglect duty. Therefore saith
   David, I sought thy precepts.' It is an emphatical expression. To seek
   God's precepts is more than barely to do them; to seek them, that is,
   with all diligence. We labour after the knowledge of them, and grace to
   practise them; it is to give up our minds and hearts; it notes earnest
   study and affection to them, will, and care, and all to the practice of
   God's will. Where there is an honest and earnest endeavour to obey
   God's command in all things, this proves a believer's interest. In
   times of trouble you must expect your confidence will be assaulted. Now
   when Satan or conscience represent God as putting thee off thus. What!
   come you to me? thou art a grievous sinner; but, Lord, I am thine. How
   prove you that? I seek to know thy will. How to perform that which is
   good, I find not,' Rom. vii. We cannot always find it; that is, serve
   God with exactness of care; but if this be the bent of our hearts, if
   we seek it, we may come with confidence, and look God in the face, and
   say. Lord, I am thine.

   3. We may improve it with confidence in prayer, I am thine, save me.
   God saves man and beast, Ps. xxxvi. 6, therefore will save his own, he
   that is our father and our God: I know that my God will save me,' saith
   David, Ps. xx. 6-8. There are some God will not save: They are not
   mine, therefore I will break down their bulwarks.' In the Book of
   Chronicles it is said, Why transgress you the commandment of God, that
   you cannot prosper?' There is an utter incapacity when men will be
   sinning away their protection. Here is your great plea in time of
   danger, in adversity, go to God and say, I am thine; Lord, save me.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON C.

   I have seen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding
   broad.--Ver. 96.

   IN this verse the scripture, as the charter of our hopes, and the seed
   and principle of our spiritual being, is recommended above all things
   in the world as that which doth chiefly deserve our respect and care.
   Consider the word by itself, and you will find it excellent; but
   consider it by way of comparison with the vanity and insufficiency of
   other things, and the excellency thereof will much more appear. As in a
   pair of balances, when things come to be weighed together, you will
   soon see the difference, and which is heaviest; so here in the text
   both scales are filled; on the one side there is the world and the
   perfections thereof, and on the other side the word of God and the
   benefit that we have thereby, and sensibly the beam breaketh on the
   word's side; in the one scale there is limited perfection, which will
   soon have an end; in the other, a happiness that hath length and
   breadth, I have seen an end,' &c.

   In the words there is a thesis or proposition, and then an antithesis,
   or something said by way of opposition to that position. The thesis, I
   have seen an end of all perfection:' and the antithesis, But thy
   commandment is exceeding broad.' Both together will yield us this
   point:--

   Doct. That the serious consideration of the frailty and fadingness of
   all natural and earthly perfections should excite and quicken us to
   look after that better and eternal estate which is offered to us in the
   word of God.

   I shall make good this proposition by going over the circumstances of
   the text as they are offered to us.

   First, I begin with the thesis or proposition, I have seen an end of
   all perfection; and there you may take notice--

   1. Of the subject or matter here spoken of, it is perfection;
   understand it in a natural and worldly sense, the most excellent of all
   the creatures, and the greatest glory of all natural accomplishments.

   2. The extent, all perfection, whatever it be.

   3. The predicate, hath an end.

   4. The confirmation from sense, I have seen. It is either dictum
   experientiae, I have often seen it fall out before my eyes; or dictum
   fidei, I could by faith easily see to the bottom of the creature, see
   vanity in it whilst in its greatest glory. Let us open these things.

   Mark, it is not said in the concrete, I have seen an end of perfect
   things; but in the abstract, I have seen an end of all perfection
   itself. The most perfect of worldly things are but imperfect; man, in
   his best estate, is altogether vanity, Ps. xxxix. 11.

   And then mark the extent of it, it is all perfection;' not only some
   but all perfection; wisdom and learning, as well as beauty and
   strength, wit and wealth, honour and greatness; I have seen an end of
   all of it. Many will readily grant that some kind of perfections are
   slight; but all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Here is a meditation
   fit for per sons of all sort and conditions. For great ones that they
   presume not; for mean ones, that they repine not; for the old, whose
   vigour and strength is gone, in whom it is verified; and for the young,
   or those that are in the vigour and freshness of youth, in whom within
   a little while it will be verified; for the rich, that they trust not
   in uncertain riches; for the poor, that they be not over-dejected; for
   the honoured, that they please not themselves overmuch with the blasts
   of popular breath and vain applause; the disgraced, that they may make
   a sanctified use of their afflictions. All perfection, first or last,
   will wither and decay.

   And then here is the predicate, hath an end; the word also signifieth
   limit or bound; there is an end in regard of length, duration, and
   continuance, and an end in regard of breadth and use; that also must be
   taken in; for the narrowness of worldly comforts and the breadth of the
   commandments are often opposed one to the other. I will show you--

   First, That all earthly perfections have their bounds and limits as to
   their use and service; they are good for this and that, but not for all
   things; but godliness is profitable for all things,' 1 Tim. iv. 8. They
   are not able to bear full contentment to the mind, or give full
   satisfaction to the heart, at least in all conditions and sorts of
   afflictions; riches will help against poverty, and health against
   sickness, but godliness is profitable to all things.' There are many
   difficulties and dangers in which the limited power of the creatures
   cannot help us; but the word of God, applied and obeyed, and followed
   with his mighty Spirit, will yield us relief and comfort in all cases
   and conditions. All the pleasures and profits, and honours of the world
   are nothing to this. As, for instance, all these perfections cannot--

   1. Give us any solid peace of conscience and rest to our souls; in the
   midst of all our fulness there is something wanting; carnal affections
   must be mortified before they can be satisfied. Grace must do that for
   you; it is godliness that brings contentment to the heart of man: 1
   Tim. vi. 6, Godliness with contentment is great gain.' Alas! wealth can
   never do it; our desires are increased the more we have; and the way to
   contentment is not to increase our substance, but to limit our desires;
   as in a dropsy, the way to cure the man is not to satisfy him with
   drink, but to open a vein to take away his thirst. We expect too much
   from the creature, and then the disappointment breedeth trouble; and
   therefore, Eccles. i. 14, why do you spend your money for that which is
   not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not? Outward
   things do not bear a thorough proportion with all the wants and desires
   and capacities of the soul, and therefore cannot give solid peace to
   our souls.

   2. It cannot make you acceptable to God, neither wealth nor beauty, nor
   honour, nor strength; it is grace that is of great price in the sight
   of God: 1 Peter iii. 4, The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in
   the sight of God of great price.' This is a beauty that doth never fade
   nor wax old: Since thou wert precious in my sight, thou wast
   honourable, and I have loved thee,' Isa. xliii. 4. God loveth his
   people for the grace he putteth into them, not for the outward gifts he
   bestoweth upon them. It is grace that makes us amiable to God, and fit
   objects of the divine complacency; you are not a jot the more pleasing
   to God when rich than when poor. No; but the more hateful to him, if
   you are not rich towards God, Luke xii. 21.

   3. It cannot stead you in your greatest and deepest necessities, and
   therefore they are but limited. There are two great necessities wherein
   all creature comforts will fail:--

   [1.] In troubles of conscience. Men do pretty well with their worldly
   portion and happiness till God sets their consciences awork, and begins
   to rebuke man for sin, and reviveth the sense of their own guilt and
   liableness to the curse. In such a case, all the glory and profit and
   pleasure of the creature will do no good; it cannot allay the sense of
   God's wrath scorching the soul for sin: Ps. xxxix. 11, When thou with
   rebukes doth chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume
   like a moth.' Tell him of honours, friends, estates, pleasures, all is
   nothing; the virtue of that opium wherewith he laid his soul asleep is
   now quite spent. Trouble of conscience arrests the stoutest and most
   jovial sinners, and layeth them under sadness and horror. Judas threw
   away his thirty pieces of silver when his guilt stared him in the face:
   I have sinned in betraying innocent blood,' Mat. xxvii. 4. When God is
   angry the creatures cannot pacify him and make you friends. As when a
   man is going to execution with a drooping and heavy heart, bring him a
   posy of flowers, bid him smell them, and comfort himself with them, he
   will think you upbraid his misery; so in troubles of conscience, what
   good will it be to tell a man of riches and honours. The remedy must be
   according to the grief; so that if outward things could satisfy the
   heart, they cannot satisfy the conscience; our sore will run, among all
   the creatures, and there is no salve for it.

   [2.] They will not stead us at the hour of death, when a man must
   launch out into eternity, and set sail for an unknown world. Can a man
   comfort himself then with outward things, that a man is great, rich,
   and honourable, beautiful or strong, or that he hath wallowed in all
   manner of sensualities? If men would look to the end of things, they
   would sooner discern their mistake: Deut. xxxii. 29, Oh, that they were
   wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter
   end!' So Jer. xvii. 9, At his latter end he shall be a fool.' He was a
   fool before, all his life-long, but now he is so in the account of his
   own heart. So Job xxvii. 8, What hope hath the hypocrite, though he
   hath gained, when God cometh to take away his soul?' The poor man would
   fain keep his soul a little longer; no, but God will take it now; and
   he doth not resign it, but God takes it by force. And 1 Cor. xv. 56,
   The sting of death is sin.' The dolours and horrors of a guilty
   conscience are revived by death, and then the weakness of worldly
   things doth best appear; our wealth and honour and pleasure will leave
   us in the dirt. When the soul is to be turned out of doors, our vain
   conceits are blown away, and we begin to be sensible of our ill choice.
   If conscience did not do its office before, death will undeceive them:
   Ps. xlix. 17, When a man dieth he shall carry nothing away with him,
   his glory shall not descend after him.' He shall be eaten out by worms
   as others are, when he cometh to go the way of all the earth; then for
   one evidence for heaven, one drachm of the favour of God, as Severus
   the emperor cried out, I have been all things, but now it profits me
   nothing.

   4. It is of no use to you in the world to come. Gold and silver, the
   great instruments of commerce in this world, are of no value there. All
   civil distinctions last but to the grave. Some are high and others low,
   some are rich and others poor; these distinctions will last but a
   while, but the distinction of good and bad lasts for ever. Their works
   follow them, but not their wealth; outward things cannot save your
   souls, or bring you to heaven.

   5. In this world it will not prevent a sickness or remove it. The
   honourable and the rich have their diseases as well as the poor; yea,
   more, they are bred upon them by their intemperance. All your houses
   and lands and honours and estates cannot ease you of a fit of the gout,
   or stone, nor ah aching tooth, nor keep off judgments when they are
   epidemical. There were frogs in Pharaoh's bed-chamber as well as among
   the meaner Egyptians, and all the king's guard could not keep them out.

   Well, then, all these things show it is of a limited use; indeed they
   serve to make our pilgrimage comfortable, and to support us during our
   service--that is the best use we can put them to; but the use the most
   put them to is to satisfy a sensual appetite or please a fleshly mind,
   Ps. xvii. 14. The utmost that these things can procure is a back well
   clothed, and a belly well filled. This is but a sorry happiness, to
   feed a little better than others, to provide a richer feast for the
   worms, yea, a prey for hell. Take all created perfections, not as
   subordinate to grace, but separate from it, it serveth but to please
   the appetite or the fancy, make the most or best of it.

   Secondly, by their time and period as to continuance. All these things
   perish in the using; like flowers, they wither in our hands while we
   smell at them: The fashion of this world passeth away,' 1 Cor. vii. 31;
   and whosoever liveth here for a while must look for changes, and reckon
   to act several parts in the world. Whatsoever was wonderful in former
   ages is lost and past with age; things that now are are not what they
   once were: Ps. cii. 26, 27, They shall perish, but thou shalt endure
   for ever,' saith the Psalmist, speaking to God; yea, all of them shall
   wax old like a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they
   shalt be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years have no end.'
   Christ, he hath no end, but men will soon see the end of all
   perfection. The world and all things were made ea lege ut aliquando
   pereant--that they might at length fail and come to an end. That which
   you now have you cannot say it shall be yours this time twelvemonth, or
   it may be a month hence; we hold all things by an uncertain tenure. God
   may take away these things from us; for man is compared to grass, and
   the glory of man to the flower of grass, 1 Peter i. 24. What is the
   glory of man? Riches, wisdom, strength, beauty, credit, all these
   things are called the flower. Now the flower fadeth before the grass,
   and withers; the neglected stalk remaineth. When the leaves of the
   flower are shed, you may be gone and they gone. If they continue with
   you till death, then you must take your final farewell of all your
   comforts. Thus you see all perfection will have an end.

   And then, here is the confirmation from sense, I have seen. Consider
   it--(1.) As it is matter of sense or experience; (2.) As it is an
   observation upon experience.

   1. The vanity of the creature is matter of sense and plain experience.
   We have seen, and others have seen, all outward things come to their
   final period; goodly cities levelled with the earth, mighty empires
   destroyed, worldly glory blasted, honours vanished, credit and esteem
   shrunk into nothing, beauty shrivelled with age, or defaced by
   sickness; yea, all manner of greatness laid in the dust. We trample
   upon the graves of others, and within a little while others will do the
   same over ours. All things have their times and turns, their rise and
   ruin; there is no man that converseth with the world, but he will soon
   see the vanity of it David found it not only by clear reason, but by
   his own experience, I have seen,' saith he; and so will you say too
   within a while; these things will fail when you have most need of them.
   Credit and honour before the world; what is more uncertain than the
   people's affections? They that cry, Hosannah,' to-day, will cry Crucify
   him,' to-morrow. Pleasures are gone as soon as they come; and when they
   are gone, they are as a thing of nought, but that they leave a sting in
   the conscience, and a sadness in the heart: Riches take wings and flee
   away,' Prov. xxiii. 5. You can be no more confident of them than of a
   flock of wild fowl that pitcheth in your field. Honour is soon gone.
   Haman is one day high in favour, the next day high upon the gallows.
   Strength and beauty are soon assaulted by diseases. It will be matter
   of sense; better believe it than try it; then it will prevent a great
   deal of vexation, and the shame of disappointment Seldom doth a man act
   the same part in the world for a year together; now joyful, anon sad;
   now children, then none; now married, anon in a widowhood condition. It
   is much in the desire and thoughts of natural men to have a perpetual
   enjoyment of this life and the comforts of it; but it will never be.
   They perish, and we must die; and when we are gone, our glory will not
   be remembered. Solomon, recordeth his experience of the vanity of all
   earthly things. Oh, that we would believe it r without trying
   conclusions! You that are so eager after the world, what will you think
   of it when it is parting from you, or you from it? Will they then be
   found to be such excellent things as you once deemed them to be? Oh,
   no! At last you must come to this, I have seen an end of all
   perfection;' and then you will say, Oh, how hath the world deceived me!
   I have laboured for nought!

   2. I have seen:' that is, with a spiritual eye; this should be observed
   and improved by faith. Many are sensible of the vanity of the creature,
   but are not a jot the wiser: Ps. xlix. 13, This their way is their
   folly, yet their posterity approve their sayings.' They are sensible of
   the folly of their ancestors, but yet do not mend by it. We should not
   only see with our eyes, but understand with our hearts. When the wise
   man went by the field of the sluggard, he saw it over grown with thorns
   and nettles, and the stone wall thereof broken down: Prov. xxiv. 32, I
   saw it, and considered it well; I looked upon it, and received
   instruction.' We should profit by everything. In this sense we may
   gather figs off thistles and grapes off thorns. Especially should we
   observe the vanity of all sublunary things: Eccles. vii. 2, It is
   better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting;
   for this is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to heart.'
   We should make a good use of these occasions; a man seeth his own end
   in the end of others, and by their death is admonished of his own
   frailty and mortality. It is a sad sign when this is not considered:
   Isa. xlii. 25, Yet he laid it not to heart;' Isa. xxvi. 11, Lord, when
   thy hand is lifted up, they will not see, but they shall see.' They
   shall be forced to take notice of what now they will not, when God's
   hand is upon them to their utter confusion.

   3. I have seen.' Happy they that have such eyes! But alas! there is a
   great deal of difference between the sight of the senses and the sight
   of the understanding. When we see things with our eyes, there is a
   natural blindness or brutishness, or a veil upon our hearts, that we
   mind them not. Men have eyes to see, but they have not a heart to see.
   So God complains, Jer. v.'21, They have eyes and see not, ears and hear
   not.' So Deut. xxix. 3, 4, The great temptations which thine eyes have
   seen, and the signs and those great miracles: yet the Lord hath not
   given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear unto
   this day.' So Isa. vi. 9, 10, And he said, Go and tell this people,
   Hear ye indeed, but understand not, and see ye indeed, but perceive
   not: make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
   shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their
   ears.' Though things be never so plainly delivered, so power fully
   pressed, so apparently verified; and so they see and hear, and receive
   no more benefit than if they had never heard nor seen it, God
   withholding and withdrawing the efficacy of his Spirit, whereby it
   might be beneficial to them for good. So Isa. xlii. 20, Seeing things,
   but thou observest not; opening the ears, but thou nearest not.' They
   see the wonderful works of God, but do not consider them as wise people
   ought to do: Isa. i. 3, The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his
   master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider;'
   Ezek. xii. 2, Thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which
   have eyes to see, and see not, they have ears to hear, and hear not:'
   that is, they make no use of them, but strive and endeavour to put it
   out of their minds. So John ix. 39-41, And Jesus said, For judgment I
   am come into this world, that they which see not might see, and they
   that see might be made blind. And some of the Pharisees which were with
   him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? Jesus said
   unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say we
   see, your sin remaineth.' There is a great deal of difference between
   the sight of believers and unbelievers; the one sees with an
   understanding heart, the other without it. In the one there is a free,
   ready, and sincere use of their disciplinable senses, that they may
   learn his word and walk in his ways, that they may profit in the
   knowledge of God, and so get understanding and spiritual prudence. The
   other are brutish, ignorant, or idle, negligent, and forgetful; they
   shut their eyes, and their ears are uncircumcised, and so they know not
   what they know. The causes of this are, first, non-attendancy or
   inadvertency, prejudicate opinions and rooted lusts, hinder their
   profiting. Look, as the sun, moon, and stirs, though they move with a
   most swift and rapid motion, seem to a vulgar eye to stand still, or at
   least to move very slowly, so these sublunary things, though they are
   always passing, yet the inward thought of worldlings is that they shall
   endure for ever. Oh, labour then for this spiritual and heart-affecting
   sight! If a man could behold this world in the light of a divine
   knowledge, he would find it to be but a vanishing shadow. Though the
   vanity of the creature be a plain truth, and taught by daily
   experience, and is easily and commonly acknowledged, yet it is not easy
   to make this truth have a deep impression upon the hearts of men. They
   are naturally unwilling to admit thoughts of a change, Amos vi. 2,
   because they are unable to sanctify themselves and look after a better
   and spiritual estate. But let us not grieve the Spirit of God by our
   unteachableness in so plain a point. When we are told of the frailty
   and slipperiness of worldly comforts, we shake our heads and confess it
   to be true, but improve it not, at best conceive some weak and faint
   resolutions, but they soon vanish, and we are as worldly and carnal as
   ever we were; and therefore pray as David, Ps. xc. 12, So teach us to
   number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.' You have seen
   the first part of the text--here is perfection, all perfection; then
   all perfection hath an end; and this is to be seen, it is liable to
   sense; and it should be improved by grace. If all creature perfection
   hath an end:--

   Use 1. Let it moderate our desires; for who would court a flying
   shadow, especially when these pursuits hinder us from looking after
   better and eternal things? Jonah ii. 8, They that seek lying vanities
   forsake their own mercies:' that is, they might have been their own, if
   they had chosen them. Within a while the world will be but a stale
   jest, and the laughing fit is over, and then our sorrow cometh; the
   feast will be at an end, and then we begin to feel the gripes of a
   surfeit.

   Use 2. Let it moderate our sorrows and fears. Our sorrows; when these
   things befall us, it is no strange thing. 1 Peter iv. 12; it is no more
   strange than to see the night succeed the day, or to see a shower come
   after sunshine; it is no wonder to see a light thing move up ward, nor
   a heavy thing to move downward. So our fears; when the power and
   strength of the world is turned upon us, there will be an end of all
   our evils, but not of the word of God. We shall everlastingly find the
   effects of his truth and promise, though our enemies excel in worldly
   pomp, and seem to be grounded upon an immutable foundation; but as
   powerful as they seem to be, they shall at length come to an end: Job
   v. 3, I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his
   habitation:' when the foolish, that is, the wicked, seemed to get
   rooting, then I cursed, not by way of imprecation, but by way of
   prediction.

   Use 3. It serves to moderate our delights. No day so pleasant but the
   night puts an end to it, no summer so fruitful but a barren winter
   overtaketh it. The Philistines were sporting on their holiday, but
   their banqueting-house became their grave and place of burial; and
   Jonah's gourd was soon withered and dried up. Worldly riches serve men
   as long as they live, and after death do some service in conveying
   their bodies to the grave by a pompous funeral; but there it leaves
   them. But the word of God supports us against all temptations while we
   live, and conveys us to death with comfort, and the fruit of it abideth
   with us; after we are dissolved the soul immediately hath benefit by
   it, and afterwards, at the resurrection, the body. We do not hold
   worldly things durante vita--during our life, nor quamdiu bene se
   gesserint--as long as we shall behave ourselves well in our places; but
   only durante beneplacito--as long as God pleaseth. How often is the
   most shining glory burned into a snuff, turned into ignominy, and
   honour into contempt, and our fulness into the want of all things! A
   cobweb that has been long a-spinning is soon swept down. Yea, the time
   will come when the lust of these things shall be gone, 1 John ii. 17,
   and the time will come when we shall take no pleasure in them. As soon
   as we have the creatures, many times we are weary of them, 2 Sam. xiii.
   8; as Amnon hated Tamar when he had satisfied his lusts; and David
   longed for the waters of Bethlehem, and when he had it, he would not
   drink it. When we come to consider these things, the imperfections that
   before lay hid are discovered by fruition.

   Secondly, Let us now come to the antithesis, but thy commandments are
   exceeding broad.

   Before I come to discuss the words in particular, I observe--

   First, that the stability of the word of God is often opposed to the
   vanity of the creature: Isa. xlvi. 8, The flower fadeth and the grass
   withereth, but the word of God abideth for ever.' So 1 Peter i. 25, All
   flesh is grass, and the glory of man is as the flower of grass; but the
   word of God liveth and abideth for ever:' and 1 John ii. 17, The world
   passeth away, and the lusts thereof; but he that doth the will of God
   abideth for ever.' So Luke x. 41, 42, Martha, thou art careful and
   troubled about many things; but one thing is needful, and Mary hath
   chosen the good part, which shall never be taken away from her.' Now,
   what doth this teach us, but that when we see the vanity of earthly
   things, we should be informed what better things to set our hearts
   upon? The hearts of men cannot be idle, their oblectation must be upon
   something; when pleasures, and riches, and honours are found vain and
   perishing, there is a more enduring substance to be looked after.

   Secondly, That these better things are discovered by the word of God,
   now life and immortality is brought to light through the gospel,' 2
   Tim. i. 10, and he that doth the will of God shall increase his
   knowledge, he that doth the will of God shall know what doctrine is of
   God. This doth direct us in making our choice; the independent heart of
   man will choose something to adhere to. Now, in the word of God we have
   direction what to choose. The use of all things present is temporal,
   but the use and benefit of the word is ever lasting; this will do us
   good another day. All things visible have their own perfection in their
   kind, and do extend, some of them to one temporal use and some to
   another; but the word of God extendeth in its kind to all uses; as
   godliness is profitable to all things; it bringeth blessedness in this
   life and in the world to come, 1 Tim. iv. 8. A man may satisfy himself
   in the contemplation of any truth and virtue that is visible; but here
   are unsearchable riches, such deep wisdom, such rich comforts, perfect
   directions, that we cannot see to the bottom of them. Every perfect
   thing in the world hath an end, but the word endureth for ever.

   More particularly in this antithesis I observe--

   1. The subject, or thing spoken of, thy commandment; that is, the whole
   word of God.

   2. The predicate or attribute, what is said of it; it is broad.

   3. The amplification of this attribute, it is exceeding broad; you
   cannot easily understand the use and benefit of it.

   1. The subject, or thing spoken of, Thy commandment is exceeding
   broad.' This breadth must be spoken of with respect to the former
   clause; it is broad for its use, and then it is broad for its duration
   and continuance.

   [1.] It is broad for use. A man may soon see to the bottom of the
   creatures, but the wisdom and purity and utility of the word of God,
   and the mysteries therein contained, and the spiritual estate that we
   have thereby, you cannot see to the end of that; it extendeth to all
   times, places, persons, actions, and circumstances of actions; it hath
   an inconceivable vastness of purity and spirituality. But you will say,
   There is a set number of precepts, how say you then it is exceeding
   broad'? Their use is large; and it is here put for the whole word of
   God. Adoro plenitudinem scripturarum tuarum, saith Tertullian. Here are
   remedies for every malady, and a plentiful storehouse of all comforts,
   satisfaction to every doubt; nothing pertaining to the holiness and
   happiness of man is wanting; nothing more requisite to direct, comfort,
   and support men in all conditions, prosperity, adversity, health,
   sickness, life, death. What shall I say? It is the word that sanctifies
   all our comforts, 1 Tim. iv. 5; it is the word that maintaineth our
   lives, Mat. iv. 4; it is the word that fitteth us to an immortal being,
   1 Peter i. 23. We cannot easily express the comprehensiveness of it,
   and the benefit we have by it. When all earthly things fail, the word
   will be a sure comforter and counsellor to us; it doth not only tell us
   what we should do, but what we shall be. In short, the word of God
   describeth the whole state of the church and the world, and what shall
   become of it in the world to come. There is a foolish curiosity that
   possesseth many in the world, who desire to know their destiny, and
   what is in the womb of futurity; as the king of Babylon stood upon the
   headways to make divination. Now, let this curiosity be turned to some
   profitable use; nothing deserves to be known so much as this, What
   shall become of us to all eternity? If the question were, Shall I be
   rich or poor, happy or miserable in this world? it were not of such
   great moment, for these distinctions do not outlive time; but the
   question is of great moment, whether I shall be eternally miserable or
   eternally happy? It is a foolish curiosity to know our earthly state,
   the misery of which cannot be prevented by our prudence or foresight;
   but it concerneth us much to know whether we are in a damnable or
   saveable condition, while we have time to remedy our case; and this the
   word of God will inform you of assuredly. Well, the commandment is
   exceeding broad.' This is the word that discovereth to you the nature
   of God and the holy angels, the souls of men, the state of the world to
   come. Who is the author of scripture? God: thy commandments.' The
   matter of scripture? God; it was not fit that any should write of God
   but God himself. What is the end of this word? God. Why was this word
   written but that we might ever lastingly enjoy the blessed God? As
   Caesar wrote his own commentaries, so God, when there was none above
   him of whom he could write, he wrote of himself; by histories, laws,
   prophecies and promises, and many other doctrines, hath he set himself
   forth to be the creator, preserver, deliverer, and glorifier of
   mankind; and all this is done in a perfect manner. Men mingle their
   imperfections with their writings; though holy and laudable for their
   names, yet they discover themselves in all they do; their words and
   speeches are never so perfect but there is something wanting, and here
   you can find nothing but God; here God hath written a book whose words
   are perfect, nothing can be added, nothing taken away. To say there is
   an idle word in scripture, is great blasphemy, saith Basil. We have no
   reason to run to human inventions, for the word prescribeth every duty,
   everything that is to be believed and done in order to salvation. Open
   the gap once, and there is no end; one brings in one thing, and then
   another, and from hence comes all the ceremonies that do abound in the
   church. It is not only most perfect, but most profitable, and
   containeth all kinds of learning. Common crafts will teach us how to
   get our bread, but this how to get the kingdom of heaven. Law
   preserveth estates, the testament of men; this the testament of God,
   the charter of our in heritance. Physic cureth diseases of the body;
   this afflicted minds and distempered hearts. Natural philosophy raiseth
   men to the contemplation of the stars, but this to the contemplation of
   God their maker. By history we come to know of the rise and ruin of
   kingdoms, states, and cities; by this, the creation and consummation of
   the world. Rhetoric serves to move affection; this to kindle divine
   love. Poetry causeth natural delight; this delight in God: no writing
   like this.

   [2.] As it hath a breadth for use, so for duration and continuance; it
   is the eternal truth of God, that shall live for ever: Mat. v. 18,
   Heaven and earth shall pass away, but not one jot or tittle of the law
   shall fail.' So Mat. xxiv. 35, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
   thy word shall not pass away.' But how doth the word continue for ever?
   Not the word itself, but--

   (1.) The obligation and authority of the word continueth for ever. It
   is an eternal rule of faith and righteousness to the church, that is
   more stable than heaven and earth. Let me show you how the doctrine is
   perpetual. The original draught is in God himself. The substance and
   matter of the moral law is perpetual, namely, the perfect love of God
   and of our neighbour; but the form is not; we shall have no need of
   precepts, and prohibitions, and promises, and threatenings in the light
   of glory, which we have need of in the light of grace. Fierce horses
   need a bridle, and there is other kind of discipline for children when
   grown up than when young. When they are young, we correct their bodies;
   but when they are grown up, we correct and punish them by
   disinheritance. The prop is removed when the thing standeth fast upon
   its own basis. When we come to heaven, we have intuitive apprehensive
   knowledge; we shall have no other bible but the Lamb's face. Many
   things that are necessary by the way are not necessary when faith is
   changed into vision and hope into fruition. Scripture is necessary, as
   letters to the spouse from her beloved while absent, when present there
   is no such need. We need not a bond when payment is made; so scripture
   is the indenture between us and God here; but when that is past, we
   shall not need scripture.

   (2.) It is eternal in the fruit; it bringeth forth the blessing of
   eternal life to them that keep it and obey it: 2 John 2, For the
   truth's sake that dwelleth in us, and shall be in us for ever.' So John
   viii. 51, He that believeth in me shall never see death.' Why I holy
   men die as well as others; but they have a being in the world to come;
   and therefore the word of God is called the word of eternal life,' John
   vi. 68; that is the end and use of it, it maketh them capable of
   eternal life that obey it. So 1 Peter i. 25, The word of God abideth
   and continueth for ever.' It is the seed and principle of eternal life;
   it is the charter of their everlasting privileges they shall enjoy in
   the world to come. But how doth the word endure for ever? It is not
   meant subjectively, but effectively, because it assures us of eternal
   life upon obeying it, and threatens eternal death to all that reject
   it.

   Use 1. Oh! then, let us be much in hearing, reading, studying, and
   obeying this word, that makes us everlastingly happy. If the
   commandment be so exceeding broad, why do we make no more use of it?

   1. Let our hearts be more taken up about it; that should be our main
   care wherein to busy ourselves day and night, Ps. i. 1. Our delight
   should not be in vain books and empty histories, but in the law of God:
   we should often look into the charter of our great hopes.

   2. Be directed by the word of God, it will direct you in every
   business: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to
   my path.' Here is direction for you in prosperity and adversity.

   3. Study it that you may be sanctified by it: John xvii. 17, Sanctify
   them by thy truth; thy word is truth.' This is the great benefit that
   we have by the word, it is the instrument of sanctification.

   4. Be much in the study of the word, that you may be assured by it,
   that you may make out your own qualification to the kingdom of heaven:
   Acts xiii. 46, Since you put away the word of God from you, you judge
   yourselves unworthy of eternal life.' When you let God's book lie by
   neglected, and never hear it, nor read it, nor meditate on it, the
   thing is past all question, you judge yourselves unworthy of eternal
   life.

   Use 2. Let this commend the word of God to us, that eternal life is in
   it. Other writings and discourses may tickle the ears with some
   pleasing eloquence, but that is vanishing, like a musician's voice.
   Other writings may represent some petty and momentary advantage, but
   how soon shall an end be put to all that? so that within a little time
   the advantage of all these books shall be gone. The statutes and laws
   of kings and parliaments can reach no further than some temporal reward
   or punishment; their highest pain is killing of the body, their highest
   reward is some vanishing and fading honour, or perishing riches. But
   God's word concerning our everlasting estate, our eternal well or ill
   being, eternal life and death, is wrapt up in these laws and
   commandments; these are rewards and punishments suitable to the eternal
   majesty of the lawgiver. Here is life and immortality brought to light,
   and offered to them who have so miserably lost it, and involved their
   souls in an eternal death; therefore let us have a precious esteem of
   the scripture, which shows us the way of escaping that misery into
   which we have plunged ourselves, and a way of obtaining eternal
   blessedness. Do not, then, go to a wrong guide and rule; nothing more
   necessary to be known than what our end is, and the way that leadeth to
   that end. The most part of men walk at random, and run an uncertain
   race; they have neither a certain scope nor a sure way. Men's
   particular inclinations and humours are an ill guide, for they incline
   us to please the flesh, and so we shall miss of everlasting
   blessedness, and wander in a by-path that leadeth to destruction.
   Naturally man is more addicted to temporal things than spiritual, and
   to worldly vanities than to spiritual enjoyments; and it is in vain to
   persuade men to look after better things till the carnal affections be
   mortified; and one way and great means to mortify carnal affections and
   inclinations is to consider the vanity of the creature; and when our
   affections are weaned from the world, we must look after some better
   things to set our hearts upon. That good which satisfieth all the
   desires and capacities of man had need to be an infinite and an eternal
   good. Now, these better things are only discovered in the word of God.
   The word of God discovers that there is such an estate as ever lasting
   glory and blessedness. The word telleth us plainly and peremptorily who
   shall go to heaven and who to hell. Well, then, if you would have this
   comfort, you must see whether you have embraced it with that reverence,
   faith, and obedience which the importance of it doth require.

SERMON CI.

   Oh, how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.--Ver. 97.

   IN this psalm you have a perfect character of a regenerate man, what he
   is, and what he ought to be, in his meditations, his exercises, his
   affections; and all this recommended to us from the frame of David's
   heart and example, and course of his way. Men of spiritual experience
   can best judge of these affections; for as face answereth face in a
   glass,' so doth the heart of one believer to another.

   In these words you have--(1.) His love asserted; (2.) Demonstrated from
   the effect.

   1. His love asserted, oh, how love I thy law!

   2. Demonstrated from the effect of it, it is my meditation all the day.

   This is an effect, for we are wont to muse upon what we love; therefore
   David, loving the law of God, is always thinking of it.

   First, For the assertion. Observe the matter asserted, and the
   vehemency of the assertion. The matter asserted is love to the law; the
   vehemency of the assertion, Oh, how I love thy law!' It is an
   admiration with an exclamation. David is not contented with a naked
   affirmation, I love thy law;' but useth a pathetical protestation of
   it, How love I thy law!' The interrogation expresseth wonder, How I
   love thy law!' And the exclamation, oh, how!' that gives vent to strong
   affection, as if he had said, It is more than I am able to express. The
   law is taken for the whole scripture, as often in this psalm.

   Secondly, For the demonstration of this affection, It is my meditation
   all the day;' that is, I do often meditate thereof, and can spend whole
   days therein. The words may signify frequency of such thoughts; they
   were not such as did come now and then, but all the day his heart was
   working on holy things, as the blessed man is described, Ps. i. 2; that
   is, every day he is working something out of the word of God. Or, it is
   my meditation all the day,' may note the depth and ponderousness of
   these thoughts; his mind did not run out upon the law with flighty
   sallies, but he had such thoughts as were solid and serious, and did
   abide with him.

   The points from hence are two:--

   1. That God's people have a great love to his word; yea, such a hearty
   affection as cannot easily be expressed.

   2. They that love the word will be meditating therein continually, It
   is my meditation all the day.'

   Doct. 1. That God's people have a great love to his word; yea, such a
   hearty affection as cannot easily be expressed.

   I will evidence that by two considerations--(1.) The word deserves this
   love; (2.) The saints are ready to yield it.

   First, The word deserves it in respect of the author, the matter, and
   the use; in all these respects is the word of God lovely.

   First, For the author; it is God's word, and they love it for the
   author's sake, the signification of his mind, as a letter from a
   beloved friend is very welcome to us. Aristotle, in his Rhetorics,
   mentioning the cause of delight, saith thus, They that love much, when
   they are speaking of what they love, or when they hear anything of the
   party beloved, or receive anything from them, it is a mighty delight
   and pleasure to them. So it is in this spiritual love. The word is
   God's epistle and love-letter to our souls, therefore for his sake it
   is the more welcome to us. And upon this ground God complains of it
   that when he had written the great things of his law to a people, they
   were neglected and slighted and counted a strange thing.' Hosea viii.
   12. I have written; God is the author, whosoever is the penman. The
   scriptures are a writing from him to us. Now for us to be strangers to
   it, and little conversant about it, argues some contempt of God; as to
   slight a letter of a friend shows little esteem of the writer. The
   saints they put it into their bosoms, and it gains upon their hearts.
   Why? It is God's epistle, it is my best friend's letter. This is
   certain, love God and you love his law; for the author's sake it will
   be dear and precious to you.

   Secondly, The saints have such a strong love to the word of God,
   because of the matter in it revealed, for it hath all the properties of
   a thing to be beloved; it is true, good, profound, and full of depth
   and mysteries. What would you desire in a doctrine to draw your hearts
   to it? Truth, goodness, and profoundness of knowledge.

   1. If certainty of truth will draw love, it is be found in the holy
   scriptures, for they are vouched by God himself to be true: Ps. xix. 9,
   The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.' And the
   gospel is called the word of truth,' Eph. i. 13, After ye had received
   the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation:' and John xvii. 17,
   Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.' To improve these places
   thus. Truth is the good of the understanding, and without the knowledge
   of which we can have no tranquillity of mind. Now of all truths this is
   the chiefest; it is not human, natural, or inferior truth, but a
   supreme divine truth, ratified by God's authority, such as nature could
   never have found out; yea, such a truth as carries its own evidence
   with it, and shows how it comes from God, and discovers itself to be of
   God. As the sun is seen by its own beams, so the word of God needs no
   other testimony than itself to commend it to the consciences of men.
   Certainly it is such a truth as doth sufficiently evidence itself to be
   of God; all God's works discover their author, and carry about with
   them their own demonstration; not only his greater works, upon which he
   hath impressed most of his wisdom and power, but even his lesser works:
   every worm and pile of grass shows who made it. To an attentive and
   discerning eye, a man cannot look upon a worm, or consider a gnat or
   any contemptible creature, but he shall see this was made by a wise
   God. God hath left his stamp upon every one of his works, and certainly
   upon his word much more; for he hath magnified his word above all his
   name,' Ps. cxxxviii. 2. There is a more clear discovery of the
   goodness, wisdom, and power of God than can be in any of his works; for
   upon this he hath laid forth all the riches of his wisdom and goodness.
   Therefore, if there be in all creatures and works of God a
   self-evidencing light to discover their author, and that invisible
   Godhead and power by which they were made, certainly there is somewhat
   in the word of God to discover its author; because of this objective
   evidence which it hath in itself it is more sure than an oracle or
   voice from heaven: 2 Peter i. 19, We have also a more sure word of
   prophecy.' More sure than what? Than that voice which he heard from
   heaven, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' This was a
   continuation indeed, you will think; and yet Peter, that heard that
   voice, telleth us that comparatively we have greater security from and
   by the word of God; not more sure in itself, but as it is given in
   evidence to us; so we have a more sure word of prophecy. A transient
   voice is more easily mistaken and forgotten than a standing authentic
   record; therefore we have a more sure ground to rest upon than ever
   hath been or can be given to sinners, subject to forgetfulness,
   jealousies, and mistakes. A voice from heaven speaking to us by name
   might more easily be suspected to be another's than the Lord's voice;
   as when God called Samuel, he suspected that it was the voice of Eli.
   Therefore an oracle cannot be so sure, safe, and self-evidencing as
   this word of God that he hath commended to us. For if God should speak
   to us still from heaven, how should we be able to distinguish it from
   delusion, or to know it was a voice from God? Might not Satan cause a
   voice to be heard in the air, and deceive us? Indeed the holy men of
   God that immediately received those voices and oracles were certified
   that it was of God, because there was some divine evidence which did
   accompany the revelation; and if there be the same impressions of God
   upon the written word, we have as much certainty as they; yea, more, as
   we view the whole revelation of God together, and more deliberately
   consider the character and signature of God that is stomped upon it. In
   short, the word when preached by Christ himself in person came in upon
   the hearts of men chiefly by this self-evidencing light; therefore it
   is said of Christ, Mat. vii. 29, that he taught them as one having
   authority, and not as the scribes.' His hearers were convinced of a
   sovereign majesty in his speech, proper to the divinity of his person;
   and when the officers were sent to apprehend him, there was such an
   evidence in his doctrine, that they cried out, Never man spake like
   this man,' John vii. 46. And still there is the same evidence in his
   doctrine written, for the voice could add nothing to it, and the
   writing can take nothing from it. The voice is but a circumstance, the
   word written not a dead letter, but can sufficiently evidence itself to
   be of God de jure; it hath the same power still, though de facto not
   always so received and so owned by the sons of men, but only by those
   that are enlightened by the Spirit to see this evidence. You find by
   daily experience every ingenious author leaves an image and impress of
   his own spirit, the mark of his genius upon every work that he doth. We
   can say of an exquisite painting, by some secret art in it, this is the
   hand of such a great master. Now, can it be imagined that God should
   put his hand to any work, and leave no signature or impress of it upon
   that work? It cannot be imagined, for it must be either because he
   could not, or he would not That God could not, cannot be said without
   blasphemy. Can men show the wisdom and learning they have attained to
   in every work, and cannot God, who is the father of lights and the
   fountain of wisdom, insinuate such secret marks and notes of his wisdom
   and divine authority into that writing he took care should be penned
   for the use and comfort of the world, that it might be known to be his?
   And that he would not, that cannot be believed neither. He that is so
   willing to show man what is good,' so willing to reveal himself to the
   reasonable creature, can we imagine he would so wholly conceal himself
   that there should be no stamp of himself upon that doctrine, to move
   our reverence and obedience, but receive it from the testimony of such
   a church? Therefore surely there is enough in the word to discover God
   to be the author. The apostles, when they went abroad to work faith,
   all the fruit that they expected from their preaching was from this
   self-evidencing light which was discovered in their doctrine; therefore
   doth the apostle say, 2 Cor. iv. 2, Not handling the word of God
   deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to
   every man's conscience in the sight of God.' They did not commend
   themselves to the consciences of men merely by the miracles which they
   wrought, though that also was some seal of their commission, and that
   they were authorised and sent by God to preach those things to the
   world, but by the manifestation of the truth commending themselves to
   every man's conscience.' So the apostle reckons up many things,
   approving ourselves as the ministers of God by the word of truth,' 2
   Cor. vi. 4. Therefore certainly there is somewhat in the truth
   delivered that will sufficiently make out itself to be of God. And when
   they render the reason why this word was not received, it was not for
   want of evidence, as if this truth could not sufficiently be known to
   be of God, but because men were blinded with their lusts and carnal
   affections; for so he saith, 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4, If our gospel be hid, it
   is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not,' &c. Which shows there is
   a light in the gospel by which it can discover itself, and if this
   light be hidden from the eyes of men, it is because their minds are
   blinded by their own lusts and carnal affections. Now, if the certainty
   of truth will draw affection, certainly those truths which are conveyed
   in the word of God should gain upon our hearts and draw affection. Why?
   Because these are sublime, supreme, and weighty truths, and come in
   with a great deal of evidence upon the hearts of men.

   2. If goodness can gain the hearts and affections of men, the word of
   God is good as well as true. There is a double desire in man--a desire
   of truth and a desire of immortality; to know the truth, and to enjoy
   the chiefest good; the happiness of the intellect, of the
   understanding, that lies in the contemplation of truth; and the
   happiness of the will, in the enjoyment of good. In the state of
   innocency, this was represented by the tree of life and the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil, to suit these two capacities and desires
   that were in the heart of man: the tree of life, to suit his desires of
   happiness; and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, to suit his
   desires of truth. Under the law, this is set forth by the candlestick
   and the table of shewbread; and in the gospel by the sacrament of
   baptism, which is called an enlightening--Heb. x. 32, After you were
   enlightened:' that is, after you were baptized--and the Lord's supper.
   Light and life are the two great things man looks after as a reasonable
   creature; to get more light, and then life, that he may enjoy God. Now,
   we are still at a loss for satisfaction of these desires until we meet
   with the word of God, where there is primum verum, the supreme truth,
   and summum bonum, the chiefest good; and therefore the directions of
   the word are called true laws' and good statutes,' Neh. ix. 13: true
   laws, all words of truth, so to perfect the understandings of men; and
   good laws, very suitable to their will and inclination, and so bear a
   full proportion with the desires of a reasonable creature. So 1 Tim. i.
   15, This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.' The
   gospel is a faithful saying; there is truth to perfect the
   understanding, and then worthy of the chiefest embraces of our wills
   and affections. As there is plain, certain, clear truth in the word of
   God, a satisfaction to the understanding in the view of truth, so there
   is also a full compliance with the motions of the will which the
   scripture offereth. Now two things there are the scriptures do reveal
   which are good for men, and cannot be found elsewhere, and all the
   world have been puzzled about them how to find them out:--(1.)
   Reconciliation with God; (2) Salvation, or eternal happiness.

   [1.] Reconciliation with God: this is the grand inquiry of the guilty
   creature, Wherewith shall God be appeased, satisfied, and we reconciled
   to him, he being offended by our sin? Micah vi. 8. How justice shall be
   satisfied, and men, that are obnoxious to the wrath of God, may come to
   have delightful communion with him, this is the great scruple that
   troubleth the creature, and all the false religions in the world were
   invented for the removing and assailing this doubt and scruple, and
   appeasing the hearts of men as to these fears of divine justice. Now,
   we can nowhere be satisfied but in the way of reconciliation and peace
   which is tendered by God himself to repenting sinners, through the
   mediation of Christ Jesus. Natural conscience will make us sensible of
   sin and wrath, and we have no ransom to pay it; and all other creatures
   cannot help us, for they are debtors to God for all they have and can
   do. How then shall God be satisfied? How shall we escape this
   vengeance? This fear would have remained upon us to all eternity, but
   that we have relief from the word of God: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in
   Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
   trespasses.' There is more glory in these few words, and more of God
   discovered in them, than there is in all the world. Oh, what a deal of
   comfort, and what a foundation for the rejoicing of our faith, is there
   laid in this reconciliation in and by Christ Jesus our Lord! That short
   sentence discovers more of God's intentions and good-will to man than
   all the bounty of his providence in and by all the creatures put
   together. Here was a secret which could never enter into man's heart,
   nor do we find a syllable of it written in any heathen book as to the
   way of it, how it shall be brought about; a truth so incredible to
   flesh and blood, that the prophet, when he speaketh of this wonder,
   asketh, Who hath believed our report?' Isa. liii. 1; who hath believed
   that he should bear our sorrows, and be wounded for our transgressions,
   and bruised for our iniquities, and that the chastisements of our peace
   should be upon him, and by his stripes we should be healed? Here is the
   great secret God hath revealed to you in his word. This must needs be a
   secret in nature, for this was a work which merely proceeded from the
   free motion of God's will; and therefore, being not opus naturae
   divinae, but opus liberi consilii, that work which God did not do by
   any necessity of nature, but by the free motion of his own will, will
   never be found out unless God will discover it himself; for how could
   any man divine what God purposed in his heart before he brought it to
   purpose, until he himself had revealed it? Therefore it is a good word,
   because it reveals reconciliation by Christ.

   [2.] There is something more to draw our hearts to the word--that is,
   eternal salvation. We grope and feel about for an immortal good. Nature
   will give us some presages of a state after this world, some kind of
   guesses; and we are groping and feeling about for an eternal good, Acts
   xvii. 27. Man, who hath a soul that will not perish, must have some
   happiness that will last as long as his soul shall last; he would fain
   be eternally happy. Now, it is the word of God only reveals both the
   thing and the way to God; the thing itself, that there is such a state,
   and what it is: 2 Tim. i. 10, Christ hath brought life and immortality
   to light through the gospel.' It lay in darkness before, hidden under
   some guesses and representations to the old people of God, but now it
   is brought to light in the gospel. Heathens in their dark notions did
   stumble upon the immortality of the soul, which they did rather dream
   of than understand distinctly; but now all is open and clear, and God
   hath manifested to you that there is a rest for the children of God,'
   and a happiness after this life. And also God hath revealed the way how
   to seek it, and how to attain and get this eternal happiness; therefore
   the holy scriptures are said to be able to make wise to salvation,' 2
   Tim. iii. 15: it doth direct you in this way; that is wisdom indeed, to
   be wise to salvation. To be able to turn and wind in the world, to be
   wise only in the present generation, as the children of this world are,
   it is folly rather than wisdom; as when children can set forth their
   toys, we do not look upon it as any piece of wisdom, but folly. Wisdom
   lies in fixing a right end, in a choice of fit means, and in a
   dexterous prosecution of those means for the attainment of this end.
   Now the holy scriptures make you wise to salvation--that is, to fix
   upon a right end, for they discover that there is a happiness that we
   may fix upon, and they direct us in the way; and then by mighty and
   potent methods of reasoning they quicken and awaken us to look after
   this business, that we may dexterously pursue it as the great care that
   lies upon us; therefore the children of God delight in the word,
   because this makes them wise to salvation. Here they have a perfect
   blessedness, and a powerful way of argumentation, and the soul is
   quickened to look after these great and everlasting hopes.

   3. The doctrines of the word are profound truths: Thy testimonies are
   wonderful, therefore doth my soul keep them,' Ps. cxix. 129. They are
   remote from vulgar and ordinary knowledge. The word of God is not only
   called a doctrine according to godliness,' 1 Tim. vi. 3, but a mystery
   of godliness.' I Tim. iii. 16. Since the fall there is a curiosity of
   knowledge, a desire whereby man not only seeks what is true and good,
   but what is rare and profound; we have no need to run to other books.
   True depth and true profoundness are to be found in the word of God.
   There are wonders in God's law, if we had eyes to see them: Ps. cxix.
   18, Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
   law:' things indeed so profound and so mysterious that the angels
   desire to pry into them, 1 Peter i. 12. Those spirits that live in the
   blessed vision and constant fruition of God, yet they did find a depth
   of wisdom in salvation by Christ, such a ravishing mystery, that they
   curiously are taken up in the study of it, and they delight in the view
   of those things which are commended to us for our study: Eph. iii. 10,
   To the intent that now, unto the principalities in heavenly places,
   might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.' God's word is
   a glass wherein those glorious creatures do, as in a mirror, behold his
   wisdom, and are in some sort bettered by it. The state of angels is a
   happy state, but it is finite, capable of being improved and bettered,
   and that by the doctrine of the holy scriptures. Well, then, such are
   the depths and various excellences of the word of God, that the saints
   know not how more pleasantly and contentedly to spend their thoughts
   and time than in the search and view of those truths, where such
   notable mysteries are revealed about the nature of God, creation,
   providence, the story of man's fall, redemption by Christ, the way to
   true happiness, and the like. Both the grounds of faith and rules of
   practice are all such as are above the pitch of human understanding;
   natural reason cannot find them out, and now they are revealed by God,
   the mind doth not fully apprehend them.

   Thirdly, The use of scripture, the ends for which God hath appointed
   it, and the uses for which it was given.

   1. To increase the knowledge of God. Now, the saints would know more of
   God, and better their notions of him; as Moses, his great request to
   God is, Tell me thy name:' when he learned that, Show me thy glory;' he
   would fain know more of God. So the saints would fain know more of God;
   therefore the word is dear and precious to them, because it discovers
   so much of God, Hosea vi. 3. This is their property, they follow on to
   know the Lord.' They do not content themselves with their first and
   infant notions, but aspire to know him more and more; for their love,
   fear, and trust, and all, doth depend upon the knowledge of God. If we
   had more knowledge of God, we should love him more and trust him more:
   Ps. ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.' We
   know God but as men born blind know the fire; they know there is such a
   thing as fire, for they feel it warm them, but what it is they know
   not; so that there is a God we know, but what he is we know little, and
   indeed we can never search him out to perfection; a finite creature can
   never fully comprehend that which is infinite. The saints are following
   on to know the Lord; they desire to know more and more, and there is no
   such means to discover God to them as this way.

   2. The use of the word is to convert the soul and to bring it home to
   God: Ps. xix. 7, The law of God is perfect, converting the soul.' There
   is the perfection of God's word, it is God's instrument for converting
   of souls, or turning of them back to him again. For conversion, take it
   in its whole latitude, compriseth this, to humble us, to cleanse us, to
   bind up our broken hearts. Because of all these uses, the children of
   God love his word. It serves--

   [1.] To humble us for sin: Jer. xxiii. 29, Is not my word like as a
   fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in
   pieces?' He appeals to it as things that we may find by experience,
   that the word of God is not only a hammer to break, but afire to melt.
   As a battered vessel, when it is to be new formed, must be melted, that
   it may be capable of this new form, so no such way to melt the heart,
   and make it capable of God's purpose, as the word of God; no such thing
   to break the heart, no such terrors and agonies like those the word
   works; and to melt the heart, to make it pliable to God's use, no such
   thing as the word of God to affect us for sin, for sin as it is a
   breach of God's law, or an offence to God.

   [2.] It hath this use, to cleanse the heart, and subdue it to the
   obedience of Christ: Ps. cxix. 9, Wherewith shall a young man cleanse
   his way? By taking heed thereunto according to thy word.' Young men,
   who more stubborn and boisterous than they, that are carried on with
   great strength and fervour in the very heat of their rebellion against
   God? Well, the word of God can cleanse the heart of a young man. As
   Plato saith of youth, that it is such a beast as will not easily come
   to hand. Now for cicurating and taming this beast, for the captivating
   those rebellious affections in youth, and cleansing and working out the
   filthiness that is in us, nothing like the word. And it is by these
   spiritual weapons that every thought is brought into captivity to
   Christ, 2 Cor. x.; and then, as it is obstinate, the power of the word
   breaks the force of our lusts.

   [3.] For comforting and binding up the broken-hearted. Human wisdom and
   eloquence can do nothing to purpose this way; but when God by the word
   reveals to a man his righteousness, then his flesh shall come again as
   a child's, he shall return to the days of his youth,' Job xxxiii. 25.
   Though a man before did walk up and down as a ghost, was, as it were, a
   walking skeleton, and his marrow was sucked out of his bones by the
   terrors of the Lord that were upon him, yet when he hath God's word to
   show, under God's hand, for his pardon, this brings his comfort; his
   flesh shall revive, he shall return fresher than a child, and shall
   return to the days of his youth; his strength, joy, and comfort shall
   come again. Therefore, oh, how they love the law! because they have
   felt in their heart it must be God's word; for that which wounds must
   also heal.

   3. To make us perfect as well as to begin the work: 2 Tim. iii. 17, it
   is said, The word of God is able to make the man of God perfect,
   thoroughly furnished to all good works:' so that in this perfection
   there are three uses for which the word serves:

   [1.] For building up in faith, or increasing in internal grace. The
   word of God is not only for novices, but for grown persons, that there
   may be a continual dropping into the lamps, as it was in the vision of
   Zechariah: Acts xx. 32, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
   grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance
   among all them which are sanctified.' It is not enough to lay a
   foundation, but there must be a building up. Now, what is that which
   builds us up? The word of his grace;' that is, God's blessing upon the
   reading and hearing the word; for the apostle speaks it when he was
   taking leave of the Ephesians: I commend you to God, and the word of
   his grace:' that is, the word of grace sent among them, by their
   ordinary officers continued to them, blessing the reading and hearing
   the word by their ordinary officers; there would be no need of Paul,
   the room should be supplied. Habits of grace must still be maintained
   by fresh influences, and they always come into us by the word of God;
   therefore, after we are converted and born again, the word is useful,
   that we may grow thereby,' 2 Peter ii. 2.

   [2.] To direct our practice; that is one use the word serves for; so it
   is said, 2 Peter i. 19, We have also a more sure word of prophecy,
   thereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in
   a dark place:' in this state of ignorance wherein we are, for that is
   figured by those words, in a dark place.' Sure it is a great blessing
   to have a light shining to us that we may not wander, and fall into the
   snares wherewith we are encompassed. We are apt to forget and mistake
   our way; we are very forgetful, and our way is narrow, hardly found and
   hardly kept; and Satan is full of wiles and deceits, like an ignis
   fatuus, ready to lead us out of the way; therefore we had need have a
   sure guide and a sure light: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp to our
   feet and a light to our paths.' It is a light not only to our paths,
   for the choice of our general way, but for all our steps, to direct us
   in all our ways.

   [3.] To comfort us in all conditions, under our crosses, confusions,
   and difficulties; we have all from the word of God: Ps. cxix. 50, This
   is my comfort in my affliction; for thy word hath quickened me.' Oh!
   when a child of God is even dead, and hath many damps and
   discouragements upon his heart, when he goes to the word, there he hath
   quickening, reviving, and is encouraged to wait upon God again. All our
   discomfort comes from forgetting what God hath spoken in his word: Heb.
   xii. 5, Ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
   unto children.' There is abundant consolation in the word, but we
   forget it, and do not carry it always in our mind, and then we lie
   under much dejection of heart; if we do not study it, discomfort will
   come upon us. In the word there is a remedy for every malady and an
   ease for every smart; and therefore this is that which makes it
   precious to the children of God.

   Secondly, The saints readily yield this love to the word. Why?

   1. Because their hearts are suited to the word. The word is every way
   suited to the sanctified nature, and the sanctified nature is suited to
   it; for that which is written in God's book is written over again upon
   their hearts by the finger of the Spirit. While we are in our natural
   state there is an enmity to the law of God: For we are not subject to
   the law of God, neither indeed can be,' Rom. viii. 7. Ay! but when they
   come to be written upon the heart and mind, then our affections are
   suited to the word. Carnal men do not love the word. Why? Because it is
   contrary to them; as Micaiah to Ahab, He prophesieth nothing but evil
   to me.' It only rubs their sores and discovers their spots to them, and
   that is grievous; and proud spirits think it to be a simple, plain
   doctrine. Worldly spirits love it not, for it draweth them off wholly
   to think of things to come; but they whose hearts, are suited to it,
   they have a mighty love to it.

   2. They have tasted the goodness of the word, therefore they love it: 2
   Peter ii. 3, As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word.'
   Why? If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:' if you have
   felt any benefit: Jer. xv. 16, Thy words were found, and I did eat
   them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.'
   When they come to taste, digest, and have experience of the benefit in
   comforting, changing, supporting their own hearts, then they love the
   word of God that hath been the instrument of it: James i. 18. He hath
   begotten us by the word of truth.' Then what follows? Be swift to
   hear.' If a man be begotten, if he hath felt the benefit of the word,
   then he will be taking all occasions to delight himself, and refresh
   his soul in the word of God, in reading, hearing, meditating, because
   he hath found sensible benefit.

   Use 1. To shame and humble us that we are so cold in our love. It is an
   admirable and an incredible affection David here speaks. Consider who
   it was that speaks thus. David, he that was encumbered with the
   employments of a kingdom, he that had so many courtly pleasures, so
   many great businesses to divert and draw him aside; yet all his
   employment could not withhold him from delighting him self in the word
   of God. It was David, that was a king, and mark how he doth express
   himself; he doth not say, I endeavour to keep thy word, but I love thy
   word.' Nay, he saith more, he speaks of it as a thing he could not
   express, How I love thy law!' No great wonder that we cannot express
   the excellency of the word; but that our affections, which are so
   finite, that these should not be expressed, this is wonderful. Then he
   speaks of it with exclamation too, Oh, how I love thy law!' and he
   speaks this to God. The Septuagint reads it, Lord, how have I loved thy
   law!' He makes God himself to be, judge not only of the truth of his
   love (as Peter makes Christ the judge of the truth of his love: I have
   many failings, I have fallen foully of late; but, Lord, thou knowest
   all things; thou knowest I love thee') but he makes God the judge of
   the strength of his love, Lord, how do I love thy law!' Have we
   anything answerable? Heart should answer heart. Are there such
   affections wrought in us as David expresseth to be in himself? This
   should shame us, for we have more reason, there is more of the word of
   God revealed to us, more of the counsel of God discovered, the canon of
   scripture being enlarged, more discovered than ever was to David, yet
   our affections so cold.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CII.

   Oh, how love I thy law! &c.--Ver. 97.

   I COME now to a second use, to press us to get this love. Take three
   arguments:--

   1. This will wean us from sinful delights, that are apt to insinuate
   with us and take our hearts; it will draw us off from carnal pastimes,
   curious studies, vain pamphlets: if you had this love, here would be
   your recreation in the word of God. Castae deliciae meae sunt
   scripturae tuae, saith Austin--here are my chaste delights, thy holy
   scripture, to be ruminating and meditating there. Here you will be
   employing your time and strength of your thoughts. There are two things
   mightily concern us--to make religion our business and recreation; our
   business in regard of the seriousness, and our recreation and delight
   in regard of the sweetness. Now, if you have a word from God, here will
   be your delight; you will be exercising yourselves contemplating the
   height, depth, and breadth of God's love in Christ Jesus, and turning
   over this blessed book: Job xxiii. 12, I have esteemed the words of thy
   mouth more than my necessary food.' Your very food for sustentation of
   your bodies will not l&gt;e so sweet to you as the word of God for the
   comfort and refreshing of the soul. When the promises are as dry
   breasts and withered flowers, when men have little or no feeling of the
   power of it upon their hearts, no wonder they are besotted with the
   pleasures of sin. Men's minds must have some pleasure and oblectation,
   but their hearts are chained to carnal delights, so that they cannot
   mind the business of their souls.

   2. Your hearts will be more stable and upright with God, more constant
   in the profession of godliness, when you come to love the word and love
   the truth for the truth's sake: 2 Thes. ii. 12, Because they received
   not the truth in the love of it, therefore God gave them up to strong
   delusions, that they might believe lies.' The Lord hath seen it fit
   ever to continue this dispensation in the course of his providence, to
   suffer seducing spirits to go forth to try how we have received the
   truth, whether only in the bare profession of it, or received it in the
   love of it. Many have received the truth in the light of it; that is,
   compelled by conscience, human tradition, current opinions, and custom
   of the country to profess it; but they do not love it, therefore they
   are easily carried away. There may be knowledge where there is not
   assent; there may be assent where there is not love; there may be some
   slight persuasion of the truth of evangelical doctrine, but if the
   heart be biassed with lust and sin, a man doth but lie open to
   temptations to apostasy. Therefore, until the heart be drawn out unto
   love to the truth it can never be stable with God.

   3. This is that which will give you a clearer understanding in the
   mysteries of godliness. The more we love the word the more we study it,
   and the deeper insight and more spiritual discerning we have in the
   mysteries thereof. It is not acute parts, but strong affections to
   divine things, that maketh us to understand them in a spiritual manner.
   If a man hath acute parts, but yet hath vile affections and carnal
   passions, these will becloud the mind and fill us with prejudicate
   opinions, so that we cannot discern the mind of God in many cases, nor
   spiritually discern it in any. Men are darkened with their own lusts,
   their minds are darkened with carnal lusts; then in seeing they see
   not, in hearing they hear not:' they do not hear what they hear. Let me
   set it forth by this similitude. A blunt iron, if it be thoroughly
   heated in the fire, will sooner pierce through a thick board than a
   sharper tool that is cold; so in the order of the affections; when a
   man's heart is heated and warmed with love to divine things, then it
   pierceth through; he hath such a sight of divine things as they shall
   affect and change his heart more than he that hath great parts. It is
   not acuteness of parts, so much as entireness of affection, which gives
   us a spiritual discerning of the mysteries of godliness; for when the
   heart is wedded to carnal lusts, the judgment is corrupted and partial,
   but when we have an affection to holiness we shall sooner discern the
   mind of God. Knowledge breeds love, and love increaseth knowledge, for
   it fortifieth and strengthened the other faculties of the soul, that
   they may be more ready in operation. Let this persuade you to get this
   love to the word of God.

   Ay! but how shall we do to get this love?

   Direct. 1. I told you before it is the fruit of regeneration; yet a
   little to quicken you hereunto, consider all the arguments which are
   brought. As whose word it is; it is God's word, and if you love God,
   will you not love the word of God? Surely your best affections are due
   to him, and if you bear any affections to him you will bear an
   affection to his word: Isa. xxvi. 8, Our desires are to thee, and to
   the remembrance of thy name.' First to thee, and then to the
   remembrance of thy name; or, as it is in the original, to thy memorial.
   If you have desires to God, then you will love that blessed book
   wherein you shall read and hear of God, where God hath displayed his
   name to you. And then consider what benefits you have by the word. It
   serves--

   1. To enlighten us and to direct us. This is our light in a dark place,
   and to guide us on all occasions. Solomon saith, Eccles. xi. 7, Light
   is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.'
   If light natural be so pleasant, what is light spiritual? And therefore
   the Psalmist compares the word of God to the sun, Ps. xix. First he
   speaks of the sun when he displayeth his beams upon the earth, then
   presently he comes to speak of the word of God. The world can no more
   be without the one than the other, without the word of God no more than
   without the sun; for as one doth revive the drooping plants, and cheer
   and refresh nature by his comfortable beams, so the word of God doth
   rejoice, refresh, and revive the hearts of God's people by its light
   and influence, Ps. xix. 7, 8. Oh! it is a comfort to have light to see
   our way. When men begin to have a conscience about heavenly things they
   will judge so. Paul and his companions in the great storm at sea, when
   they saw no sun for many days, and when they were afraid to fall upon
   rocks and shelves, with what longing did they expect to see the sun! So
   a poor bewildered soul doth experiment such another case, when his way
   is dark, and hath no direction from the word of God what course to
   take; but when he can get a little light from the testimonies of the
   Lord to guide him in his way, how sweet, refreshing, and reviving is
   this to his heart!

   2. It serves to comfort us in all straits. The word of God is, as Basil
   saith, a common shop of medicaments, where there is a salve for every
   sore, and a remedy for every malady, a promise for every condition. God
   hath plentifully opened his good-will and heart to sinners; whatever
   the burden and distress be, still there is some remedy from the word of
   God. Look, as David, Ps. xlviii. 2, 3, bids them to view Zion on all
   sides, to see if there were anything wanting necessary for ornament and
   defence, so we may say of the word of God, Go round about, see if there
   be anything wanting for the comfort of a Christian. There are promises
   of wisdom to manage our business, James i. 5; promises of defence in
   the midst of all calamities, Heb. iii. 5; promises of sustentation and
   support in God's storehouse, blessings enough for every poor soul. Then
   the word of God serves to support and strengthen us in our conflicts,
   either with sins or with afflictions, to strengthen us against
   corruptions, and quicken us to duties; the sword of the Spirit, which
   is the word of God, the choicest weapon in the spiritual warfare, Eph.
   vi. 18. Here a Christian fetcheth his all from hence. Therefore, if you
   would have these affections to the word, think what a great deal of
   benefit is to be had by it, light, comfort, and strength.

   Direct. 2. Be in a capacity to love the word. If you would have this
   strong affection David speaks of, you must be renewed and reconciled.

   1. Renewed, for this love is an affection proper to the new nature:
   Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the spirit do mind the things of the
   spirit.' It is in vain to think of any such love to God's word until we
   be renewed by God's grace. A man, as a man, may delight in the
   knowledge of the word; but to receive the word of God as the word of
   God, there must be somewhat of the divine nature, or you will not have
   such a relish and savour to spiritual things.

   2. Be reconciled to God. A guilty creature, what comfort can he take in
   the word of God, where he can see nothing but his accusation and his
   doom? When he looks into it, it shows him his natural face. A natural
   man cannot delight in the word of God, for it only revives his fears,
   and offers to his mind a sense of his misery. Therefore God's witnesses
   are said to torment them that dwell on the earth,' Rev. xi. 10. God's
   word is a torment to them; to come to the word, and study the word of
   God, and consider his mind revealed therein, this nothing but
   increaseth fears. It is a vexation to them, when they would sleep
   securely, to have their consciences rubbing up and reviving their
   fears. Therefore they are not in a capacity to delight in the word of
   God.

   Direct. 3. If you would delight in the word of God, you must get an
   esteem of spiritual enjoyments. Why are wicked men so greedily carried
   out after worldly comforts? These are the only things which they value.
   But until a man learns to value knowledge, and spiritual comforts, and
   subjection to God, and conversion of his heart to God, he will not love
   the word, which is the instrument of all these benefits. When he counts
   these as the greatest blessings, then his heart will be carried on to
   them, for the word only hath a subserviency to these things. Poor low
   creatures value themselves by plentifulness of worldly accommodations;
   they will not be so much longing after them. But when they value
   instruction above silver, and knowledge more than their gold, as Prov.
   viii. 10, when the heart is set upon spiritual things, then they love
   the word by which they might be made partakers of it.

   Direct. 4. Let a man live in awe of the word, and make it his business
   to maintain communion with God; for this will show him the necessity of
   his word to comfort and to strengthen him upon all occasions. A lively
   Christian, that in good earnest minds his work, must have the word by
   him for his strength and support, as he that labours must have his
   meals, otherwise he will faint. Painted fire needs no fuel, and when we
   content ourselves with a loose and careless profession, then we will
   not so delight ourselves in God's book and in his statutes, and run to
   those things for the support of our souls. But when we make it our
   business, then naturally we will be carried out in love to the word.

   Use 3. For trial. Have we this love to God's word? God's people love
   his word exceedingly. There are many do not hate it, do not oppose it,
   or have some cold affections this way; but have you that order of
   affection which the children of God do express?

   1. If you have a true love to the word of God, you will much exercise
   yourselves therein in reading, hearing, praying, conferring, and
   meditating; these will be constant exercises of your souls. You will be
   much in reading the word, as the eunuch returning from public worship
   was reading a portion of scripture, Acts viii. 28. It is good to see
   with our own eyes, and drink out of the fountain; not barely to attend
   upon deductions from the word, and discourses built thereupon, but to
   read the book itself; and if it seem dark, God will s*end you an
   interpreter. Then you will be delighted in hearing the word. Certainly
   the saints will take all meet occasions for this. If he hath begotten
   you by the word of truth, you will be swift to hear, James i. 19. They
   which have experimented the power of it, there needs not much ado to
   press them to come and wait upon the dispensation of the word: Ps.
   cxxii. 1, I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go up unto the
   house of the Lord.' You should be glad of these occasions of hearing
   God's word. Look, as in heaven all our comforts and all grace comes in
   there by vision, by sight, so now it comes in here in the church by
   hearing. Hearing is the sense exercised in the church, and therefore
   God's children will be much in hearing the word. Then much in
   conferring of it; what a man delights in he will be talking of, and so
   should you at home and abroad: Deut. vi. 7, Thou shalt be talking of
   them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest in the
   way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.' When you are
   at home you should be conferring of these holy things, and abroad
   seasoning your journey and business with gracious conference.

   2. If you have this love to the word of God, you will delight to get it
   into your hearts. There is the great business of a Christian, that it
   may not only be in the Bible, but may be impressed on the heart, and
   expressed by a sincere, uniform, impartial obedience, when we study
   conformity thereto in heart and life. Hypocrites may delight in
   speculation, but a child of God is delighted in the obedience and in
   conformity to his word: Ps. cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way of thy
   testimonies as much as in all riches.' Not only in the testimonies
   themselves, in the naked contemplation of these blessed truths,
   reconciliation with God, and the way to true happiness, but in the way
   and practice of these things. He that loves his rule will study an
   exact conformity thereunto. The love a child of God hath to the word
   differs from the love of a hypocrite or a temporary believer thus, by
   this similitude: in a rare piece of painting, an ordinary beholder
   takes a great deal of comfort when he seeth it or looks upon it, but
   this is nothing to that contentment which an artist takes in imitating
   and copying it out, in expressing it, when he can by his own pencil
   copy it out to the life; so that which a child of God delights in is
   when he can copy out tins word of God, get it into his heart, and hold
   it forth in his conversation, for the scripture speaks of both. Of the
   word got into the heart: James i. 21, Receive with meekness the
   ingrafted word:' when it is not only an external rule, but an ingrafted
   word. So Ps. xxxvii. 31, The law of God is in his heart,' and Ps. xl.
   8, Thy law is in my heart.' Here is the great testimony of our love to
   God's law, when we strive to have it impressed on the heart and
   expressed in the conversation: Phil. iii. 16, Let us walk by the same
   rule.' This is a double contentment when it comes to that, not only to
   the view of truth, but when the heart is a ready transcript of the word
   of God, when these things are not only revealed to him, but revealed in
   him: Gal. i. 16, It pleased God to reveal his Son in me.' There is a
   revealing things to us and a revealing things in us. Now, when this is
   our business, that all this may be revealed in us, and we may be cast
   into the mould of this doctrine, then indeed do we love the law of God:
   Rom. vi. 17, Ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which
   was delivered unto you,' or whereto ye were delivered.'

   3. They which love the word of God, love the whole word, even that
   which thwarts their natural desires, and discovers their sin to them.
   Paul saith, Rom. vii. 12, The law is holy, and the commandment holy and
   just and good.' What is the meaning of this disjunctive, the law and
   the commandment? By the commandment he means that particular law which
   had so strangely affected him, that had wrought such tragical effects
   upon his heart, made sin revive, disturbed him, discovered himself to
   himself; he loves that law which broke in upon his heart with so much
   power and evidence, and stirred up his affections. Carnal men love the
   comfortable part of the word, to be feasted with privileges; but that
   part which urgeth them to unpleasing duties, or discovers their sins,
   they love not: 1 Kings xxii. 8, He doth not prophesy good concerning
   me, but evil:' therefore I will not hear him. Though he was a prophet
   of the Lord, and came with the word of the Lord, yet, He never
   prophesied good to me; that is, such things as did please him. Do you
   think that was the temper of that wicked king alone? No; it is the
   temper of every wicked man's heart: Amos v. 10, They hate him that
   rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.' All
   wicked men have such a disposition; they hate that part of the word
   which doth stir up their fears, revive their doubts, and is contrary to
   their lusts. It is their general disposition: John iii. 20, Every one
   that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his
   deeds should be reproved.' They shun that part of the word whereby they
   might come to know themselves; either they could wish such things were
   not sins, or that they did not know them to be sins: 2 Peter iii. 5,
   For this they willingly are ignorant of.' A guilty soul hath a secret
   enmity to the word of God, being loath to read his own doom there, and
   be much occupied and employed in that which condemns and accuseth him;
   as a man that hath light ware is loath to come to the balance, or a man
   that hath counterfeit coin is loath to come to the touchstone; so they
   are loath to come too close and near the word of God, that their whole
   course may be discovered to themselves. None but a pure sincere heart
   can have such a universal love to God's law.

   4. If you love the word, you will ever love the word; for the same
   reasons that drew your heart at first continue still: Ps. cxix. 20, My
   soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all
   times.' By judgments is meant the word of God, which is the rule of
   God's proceeding with sinners. It was not for a pang only that he had
   that strong and vehement affection, but it was a constant thing at all
   times, it was the ordinary frame of his heart. Many men have good
   affections for a while, but they i abide not with them; for some have
   an adulterous affection only:' they may love the word of God while it
   is new, for novelty sake: John v. 35, Ye rejoiced for a season in his
   light:' and Acts xvii. 20, they flocked about Paul, because he seemed
   to be a setter forth of new doctrine.' This is but carnal love, that is
   soon altered. Or else it may be they have some love to the word during
   some qualm of conscience, and they may find some savour in it when they
   have a little trouble upon them, as we desire strong water in a pang,
   not as a constant diet. When they are under some working of conscience,
   then they run to the word; but as soon as they can lick themselves
   whole again, they slight it, and their love to the word is gone. As
   their trouble wears off, so their affection is worn off. These are
   driven by fearing the word, and not by the love of it. For a great
   while men are carried on pleasingly in their love to the word, but when
   it grates hard, bears hard upon conscience, and meets with their lusts,
   then they go away in discontent; as Herod heard John gladly' for a
   while, Mark vi. 20, until his Herodias was touched, and then follows
   his darling sin again. Their love is to the word if carnal credit
   accompany it, as John was welcome to the Jews until he fell under
   Herod's displeasure. The stony ground received the word with much joy,
   until the sun arose with a burning heat,' Mat. xiii. There are certain
   times when it is a credit to be religious, and when the gospel is
   befriended in the world; then men will have some seeming affection, but
   it dies away. God's children love the word for its own sake, therefore
   they ever love it. They which love the truth for foreign reasons,
   because of novelty, merely out of present necessity, public
   countenance, because it is in fashion and repute, or because they
   thought the word would flatter them more in their sins than it doth,
   these do not love the word. Thus David's affection is asserted.

   Secondly, We have David's assertion demonstrated, It is my meditation
   all the day.'

   Doct. 2. They that love the word will be meditating therein
   continually.

   There are two grounds for this--love causeth it, and love is in creased
   by it.

   1. Love causeth it. We are continually thinking of whatsoever we love.
   Rich men, that affect worldly things, are always thinking of gathering
   substance and increasing their worldly portion; as that man, Luke xii.
   17, 18, was dialogising and discoursing with himself. Carnal lovers are
   thinking of that they love, and ambitious men are feasting their souls
   with imaginations and suppositions of worldly greatness, pleasing
   themselves by framing images in their minds; and warriors are thinking
   of battles and wars, and voluptuaries are thinking of sports and
   pastimes, and a child of God is thinking of holy things. Love causes
   the soul to be more where it loves than where it lives; it is the best
   entertainment they can find for themselves to frame images of things
   loved in their minds.

   2. As love begets meditation, so meditation cherishes love. Meditation
   is the life of all the means of grace, and that which makes them
   fruitful to our souls. What is the reason there is so much preaching
   and so little practice? For want of meditation. Constant thoughts are
   operative. If a hen straggleth out from her nest, she brings forth
   nothing, her eggs chill; so when we do not sit abrood upon holy
   thoughts, if we content ourselves with some few transient thoughts and
   glances about divine things, and do not dwell upon them, the truth is
   suddenly put off, and doth no good. All actions require time and space
   for their operation; if hastily slubbered over, they cool; if we give
   them time and space we shall feel their effects. So if we hold truths
   in our mind, and dwell upon them, there will be an answerable
   impression; but when they come like a flash of lightning, then they are
   gone, and we run them over cursorily. That truth may work there is
   required three things--sound belief, serious consideration, and close
   application: Job v. 27, Lo, this we have searched it; so it is, hear
   it, and know thou it for thy good.'

   [1.] A sound belief, for it is reality that will work upon us.
   Affection is always according to the strength of the persuasion.

   [2.] There must be application. Every kind of operation is by the
   touch. The nearer the touch the greater the virtue; so the more close
   they are upon the heart, and touch, and concern us, the more they work
   upon us.

   [3.] There must be consideration: we must seriously revolve these
   things in our mind, and debate with ourselves; as, for instance, what a
   strict and precise account we are to give at the day of judgment, the
   inexpressible pains of hell and ineffable joys of heaven. Generally we
   do not believe these things. If we were persuaded there is a heaven and
   hell, if we did think of them with application, and say, Soul, thou
   must one day go either to heaven or hell, thou must one day appear
   before God, and be put under a sentence of everlasting death, or
   receive a sentence of everlasting life; if we did consider them with
   serious and with inculcative thoughts: Is it indeed so? then let me
   consider what I must do; this reasoning and debating, and whetting
   these truths upon the heart, would work upon us, and we should sooner
   see the fruit. As Elisha stretched himself often upon the Shunamite's
   son, and kept stretching himself till the child began to wax warm and
   sneezed, and then he opened his eyes, so we should spread truth upon
   the heart till affection begin to quicken it.

   Use 1. Reproof, and that of three sorts of persons:--

   1. Those that go musing of vanity all the day, and never can find a
   thought for God, for Christ, for the covenant, or for the great truths
   of the word. They have thoughts and to spare for other things. Do those
   love the word of God, and never spend a thought about it? Prov. vi. 21.
   If the word were bound upon us as a jewel and chain, then when thou
   goest it would lead thee, when thou sleepest it would keep thee, and
   when thou awakest it would talk with thee. The word would ever be
   running upon our minds if we had any hearty affections to it.
   Christians, think with yourselves; have you thoughts for other things,
   and none for God, Christ, heaven, and everlasting glory? Would you
   count him to be a charitable man that should throw away his meat and
   drink into the kennel, rather than give to him that needs and asks it?
   So, would you count him to be a godly man, one that hath a sincere love
   to God, that hath thoughts he knows not what to do with, but casts them
   away upon every idle toy and base inconsiderable thing, and not a
   thought for God? to suffer his thoughts to run waste; yea, run riot in
   envious ripenings, or unclean glances, or revengeful or proud
   imaginations; that can have thoughts for such trifles, and never a
   thought for God, and forget him days without number? Jer. ii. 32. Have
   these affections to the word of God?

   2. It reproves those persons to whom good thoughts are looked upon as a
   burden and melancholy interruption, and when they rush into their
   minds, are thrown out again like unwelcome guests. These seem to be
   described by those words, Rom. i. 28, They did not like to retain God
   in their knowledge;' when men like not to entertain thoughts of God. If
   they fasten upon our hearts we soon grow weary of them. Christians, to
   a gracious heart, one that loves God and his word, thoughts of God and
   holy things are very comfortable and sweet: Ps. civ. 34, My meditation
   of him shall be sweet.' But when they are so unwelcome, and seem so
   troublesome to your souls, have you a love to them? To be weary of the
   thoughts of God is to degenerate into devils; for it is part of the
   devils' torment to think of God: they believe and tremble; the more
   explicit thoughts they have of God, the more is their horror increased.
   If it be so with you, judge whether you have this affection.

   3. Those that read and hear, but do not meditate in order to affection
   and practice. This duty must have its turn too. If you will ever
   manifest affection, and increase affection, you must take some time to
   meditate and season your thoughts: James i. 24, For he beholdeth
   himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of
   man he was.' They lay aside thoughts of what they hear and read, and so
   go into their old course again. When you hear or read anything of the
   word of God, the greatest part of the task is yet behind; you are to
   meditate, to exercise your thoughts therein. When men hear and do not
   meditate, it is like the seed which fell upon the pathway: Mat. xiii.,
   The fowls of the air came and picked it up.' When you do not labour to
   cover it, to get it into your heart by deep and ponderous thoughts, the
   devil comes and takes it away again, when you work it not into your
   souls. Bare hearing leaves but little impression, unless we debate and
   revolve it in our minds. God spake once, and I heard it twice,' saith
   Job. He had it not only at the first delivery, but at the rebound; he
   went it over again in his thoughts.

   Use 2. Information. It informs us why we are so backward to meditate;
   it is for want of love: Oh, how love I thy law!' and then, It is my
   meditation all the day.' You think it is want of time, and want of
   parts and abilities. I tell you, it is want of love. It is but a vain
   boasting, and the greatest hypocrisy, to say we love the law of God,
   and never exercise our minds therein; for where there is love it will
   command our thoughts; and if once you have found a heart, you will find
   time, abilities, and thoughts to bestow upon holy things. Love sets all
   the wheels of the soul awork; and therefore the great reason why
   meditation is so difficult is we have not such strength and such ardour
   of affections to the things of God. The difficulty doth not lie in the
   duty itself, but in the awkwardness of our hearts to the duty. You can
   muse upon other things, why not muse upon that which is holy?

   Use 3. To press you to show love to the word of God this way by often
   meditating upon it; meditate upon the doctrines, promises,
   threatenings, man's misery, deliverance by Christ, necessity of
   regeneration, then of a holy life, the day of judgment. Fill the mind
   with such kind of thoughts, and continually dwell upon them. A good man
   should do so, and will do so. He should do so, Josh. i. 8; and he will
   do so, Ps. i. 2. Oh, do not begrudge a little time spent this way! for
   hereby we both evidence our love to the word and increase it.

   But to quicken you hereunto:--

   1. The more the heart is replenished with holy meditation, the less
   will it be pestered with worldly and carnal thoughts. The mind of man
   is restless, and cannot lie idle, therefore it is good to set it awork
   upon holy things. It will be working upon somewhat, and if you do not
   feed it with holy thoughts, what then? All the imaginations of the
   heart will be evil, only evil, and that continually,' Gen. vi. 5. These
   are the natural products and births of our spirits. And Mat. xv. 19,
   Out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts,' &c. When the heart is left to
   run loose, then we shall go musing of vanity and sin; therefore by
   frequent meditation this evil is prevented, because the mind is
   pre-occupied, and possessed already by better things; nay, the mind is
   seasoned, and vain and carnal thoughts grow distasteful to us when the
   heart is stored with good matter.

   2. The more these thoughts abide with us, the more the heart is
   seasoned and fitted for all worldly comforts and affairs. It is hard to
   touch pitch and not be defiled, to go up and down with a serious heart
   in the midst of such temptations. Nothing makes you aweful and serious
   so much as inuring your minds with holy thoughts, so that you may go
   about worldly businesses in a heavenly manner. God's children are
   sensible of this, therefore they make it their practice to begin the
   day with God: Ps. cxxxix. 18, When I awake, I am still with thee.' As
   soon as they are awake they are seasoning their minds with somewhat of
   God. And they not only begin with God, but take God along with them in
   all their comfort and business: Prov. xxiii. 17, They are in the fear
   of the Lord all the day long.' Why do vain thoughts haunt us in duty?
   Because it is our use to be vainly occupied. A carnal man goes about
   heavenly business with an earthly mind, and a godly man goes about
   earthly business with a heavenly mind. A carnal man's thoughts are so
   used to these things that he cannot take them off; but a godly man hath
   inured his mind to better thoughts.

   3. Thoughts will inflame and enkindle your affections after heavenly
   things. It is beating the steel upon the flint makes the sparks fly
   out. So by serious inculcative thoughts we beat out affections; these
   are the bellows to blow up the coals. It is a very deadening thing to
   be always musing on vanity: Cant. i. 3, Thy name is as ointment poured
   forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.' When a box i& broken, and
   the ointment poured out, when the name of God is taken in by serious
   thoughts, that stirs up affection.

   4. By holy thoughts we do most resemble the purity and simplicity of
   God. We do not resemble God so much by speech and course of our actions
   as we do by our serious and holy thoughts, for his spiritual nature and
   being is best expressed by these operations of our own spirits. You can
   conceive of God as a spirit, always beholding him self, and loving
   himself; and so you come nearer as to the being of God, the more your
   thoughts are exercised and drawn out after holy things.

   5. By these holy meditations the soul is present with God, and can
   solace itself with him. The apostle saith, We are absent from him in
   the body, but present with him by the spirit; present with him by the
   workings of our thoughts. This is the way to get into the company of
   the Spirit, to be with him, Ps. cxxxix. 18. How with him? By our
   thoughts, and by serious calling him to mind. God is not far from us,
   but we are far from him. God is not far from us in the effects of his
   power and goodness, but we are far from God, because our thoughts are
   so seldom set awork upon him. This is the way to solace ourselves with
   God, to be much in these holy things.

SERMON CIII.

   Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies;
   for they are ever with me.--Ver. 98.

   IN the former verse you shall find the man of God had expressed his
   affections to the word, Oh, how I love thy law!' Now he renders the
   reason of his great affection, because he got wisdom thereby; a benefit
   of great value, as being the perfection of the reasonable nature, and a
   benefit highly esteemed in the world. Those which care not for the
   reality of wisdom yet affect a reputation of it: Job xi. 12, Vain man
   would be accounted wise, though he be born like the wild ass's colt;'
   though he be rude and brutish, yet he would fain be accounted wise.
   Knowledge was the great bait laid for our first parents; and so much of
   that desire is still left with us, that we had rather be accounted
   wicked than weak, and will sooner entitle ourselves to the guilt of a
   vice in morals than own any weakness in intellectuals. No man would be
   accounted a fool. Well, then, David's affection is justified; he might
   well say, Oh, how I love thy law!' because he got wisdom thereby, and
   such wisdom as carried him through all his trouble, though he had to do
   with crafty adversaries, as Doeg, Achitophel, and others, that excelled
   for worldly policy; yet, Oh, how I love thy law!' For, through thy
   commandments,' &c. In which words you have

   1. The benefit gotten by the word, wisdom.

   2. The original author of this benefit, thou.

   3. The means, through thy commandments.

   4. The benefit amplified, by comparing it with the wisdom and craft of
   his enemies, the politicians of Saul's court, men advanced for their
   great wisdom and subtlety, Thou hast made me wiser than mine enemies.

   5. The manner how he came to obtain this benefit, for they are ever
   with me.

   Doct. That God, through his commands, doth make his people wiser than
   their enemies.

   It is but David's experience resolved into a proposition. I shall--

   1. Illustrate the point by explaining the circumstances of it.

   2. Then prosecute it.

   First, The benefit obtained is wisdom. Mark--

   1. It is not craft, or wisdom to do evil--that is to be learned in the
   devil's school--but divine wisdom, such as is gotten by study and
   obedience of God's laws: Gen. iii. 1, The serpent was the subtlest of
   all the beasts in the field.' Satan's instruments are very acute in
   mischief, wise to do evil, but to do good have no knowledge,' Jer. iv.
   22; cunning enough in a way of sin, but to seek in every point of duty;
   your souls must not enter into their secrets. This wisdom should rather
   be unlearned; better be fools and bunglers in a way of sin, than wise
   to do evil: 1 Cor. xiv. 22, Brethren, in malice by ye children, but in
   understanding be ye men;' and Rom. xvi. 19, I would have you wise unto
   that which is good, and simple concerning evil.' Simplicity here is the
   best wisdom.

   2. It is not worldly policy, or a dexterous sagacity in and about the
   concernments of this life. There are some which have the spirit of the
   world,' 1 Cor. ii. 12, and a genius or disposition of soul which wholly
   carrieth them out to riches, honours, and pleasures, and are notable in
   this kind of skill, in promoting their secular ends in these things. A
   child of God may be a fool to them for this kind of wisdom; for it is
   our Saviour's observation, Luke xvi. 8, The children of this world are
   in their generation wiser than the children of light.' Though David was
   wiser than his enemies, yet the children of this world are wiser in
   their generation, that is, as to carnal fetches and devices to
   accomplish their worldly purposes; in their generation, that is, about
   the course of their affairs. Thus David is not wiser than his enemies.

   3. It is not great skill in arts and civil discipline. This is indeed a
   gift of God, but given promiscuously, sometimes to the good and some
   times to the bad; sometimes to the good, for Solomon could unravel all
   the secrets of nature, and dispute of everything from the cedar to the
   hyssop, 1 Kings iv. 23, 29-31; and sometimes to the bad, as the heathen
   philosophers, many of whom knew all things almost within the circuit of
   the world. Yet how little this wisdom is to be valued in regard of that
   wisdom which we get by God's commandments, God hath in some short
   shown, in that he hath suffered those books which Solomon wrote
   concerning trees, plants, beasts, to be lost; whereas to this day the
   writings of the heathens are preserved, as Aristotle's book De
   Animalibus, &c. But now those books in which Solomon taught the fear of
   God and true wisdom, which is godliness, are, by the singular care of
   God's providence, conserved for our use and benefit. God hath herein
   shown that we might want those other books without the loss of true
   wisdom, but those books that indeed make us wise to salvation, these
   are kept. Learning is a glorious endowment indeed, but God would give
   us that gift by the writings of heathens; but grace, which is true
   wisdom, he would give us that by the holy scripture. A man may excel in
   learning, yet, after all the profound researches and inquiries of his
   high-flown reason into the mysteries of nature, he may be a very fool,
   and be damned for ever; for Paul saith of the philosophers: Rom. i. 22,
   Professing to be wise, they became fools;' since they had not the true
   knowledge of God and the way of salvation.

   4. It is not a bare knowledge of God's will, but wisdom. Knowledge is
   one thing, and wisdom another: I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,' Prov.
   viii. 12. Many are knowing men, well skilled with notions, but they
   want prudence or practical direction for the governing of their hearts
   and ordering of their ways. In the scripture you shall find faith is
   not only opposed to ignorance, but to folly: Luke xxiv. 25, O ye fools,
   and slow of heart to believe.' Every natural man is a fool, Titus iii.
   3, though never so notionally wise and skilled in the theory of divine
   knowledge: Prov. xiv. 8, The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his
   way;' not to soar aloft in speculation, abstract from practice, and
   remote from spiritual influence, but to direct his course so as he may
   attain to the chiefest good; not only to know what is to be done, but
   to do what is to be known. Carnal men have great knowledge, and yet are
   spiritual fools for all that; they may lick the glass, and never taste
   the honey; or, like negroes, dig in mines of knowledge while others
   enjoy the gold; they may search out the mysteries of that religion
   which the godly man lives upon, dispute of heaven while others surprise
   it and take it by force; or, like the lark, soar high, but fall into
   the net of the fowler. A careful strict walking, that is the true
   wisdom; and thus we have stated the benefit.

   Secondly, Here is the author of this benefit, which is God, Thou,
   through thy commandments:' which I note, not only to show to whom we
   must go for this wisdom: If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of
   God,' James i. 5; nor to show to whom we must ascribe the glory of it;
   if we get any benefit by the word, praise belongeth to God, who is the
   father of lights, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift,' James
   i. 17. All candles are lighted at his torch, and all the stars owe
   their brightness to this sun; to the father of lights we owe all the
   light, wisdom, and direction that we have. I say, not only for these
   ends do I note it, but to show the main and principal reason why a
   child of God is far more safe by his godly wisdom than his enemies by
   all their worldly policy. Why? God is of his side, counselling,
   directing, and instructing him what to do; whereas they are acted and
   influenced by Satan: Ps. xxxvii. 12, 13, The wicked plotteth against
   the just; the Lord shall laugh at him, for he seeth that his day is
   coming.' The wicked plotteth against him, but there is a wise God that
   acts for him. He doth not say the just countermineth the wicked, and
   strains himself to match his enemy with policy and craft, but God
   watcheth for him. If it were only this policy against piety, it were
   not so much, but it is men's craft against God's wisdom: Prov. xxi. 30,
   There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord.'
   These three words express the sum and height of all natural abilities:
   wisdom notes a quick apprehension; understanding, a wise foresight
   grounded upon experience; counsel, a designation of some rare artifice
   and device. Now neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel, none of
   these can stand against the Lord. God's children are sometimes dismayed
   when they consider the advantages of their enemies, their wisdom,
   learning, malice, experience. But here is their comfort, that they may
   set God against all these--God, who is the fountain of wisdom; for he
   is interested in their cause, his wisdom against their craft; and so,
   having the direction of the mighty counsellor, they are safe.

   Thirdly, Here is the means, Through thy commandments,' or through the
   directions of the word. You will say, What can we learn from the word
   to match our enemies in policy? what wisdom will that teach us for our
   safety and preservation against the malice of our wicked enemies? There
   is our rule, and the more close and punctual we are in the observance
   of it, the more safe we are. A double wisdom we learn from the word of
   God, which is our security against the malice and craft of our enemies.

   1. This wisdom we get by the commandment; it directs us how to keep in
   with God, which is our great wisdom; this is to stop danger at the
   fountain-head: Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's ways please the Lord, he
   maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.' The way to get peace
   and safety in evil times is not to comply with enemies, but to comply
   with God. All our danger lies in his anger, not in their wrath and
   rage; for God can bridle them or let them loose upon us as he sees
   good. He hath the hearts of all men in his hands as the rivers of
   water; the creature is but God's instrument, and wholly at his dispose.
   We have no need to fear the sword, if we do not fear him that wears the
   sword; nor need we fear the creature if we do not break with God. Many
   are troubled with the ill-will of men, or about the rage of men, and
   are full of fears when they meet with any opposition in their
   profession of godliness, and how soon men may be let loose upon them in
   time of danger, but look not to the cause of it, which is their
   offending God; therefore our chief wisdom is to serve him and study to
   please him. When a war is begun between two nations, the way to end it
   is not by a treaty with this or that private soldier, or to seek their
   favour, but to treat with those that employ them; so it is not to fawn
   and crouch and court the favour of men, but to be reconciled to God,
   and get him made a friend, then we need not fear man's enmity. Now this
   wisdom the word of God teacheth us, how to walk with all-pleasing
   before God, and then the creature cannot meddle with us without his
   leave. Another place is, Prov. x. 9, He that walketh up rightly walketh
   safely; but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.' There is no
   one seems to be more exposed to danger than he that is sincere, that
   is, strictly severe to a godly purpose, that walks uprightly, that
   stands strictly and precisely upon his duty to God; and yet there is no
   man usually more safe. But he that turneth and windeth to avoid
   dangers, and runs to his shifts and studied arts to provide for his own
   security, usually is left in the mire, and comes off with some notable
   blemish; he is cast from God's protection. There are but two sorts of
   men in the world that usually do carry their purpose; they are either
   those that are perfectly honest through out, without daubing and
   warping, or those that are perfectly dishonest, that wholly give up
   themselves to a course of fraud and sin, that are resolved to boggle at
   nothing, neither checks of conscience nor rules of honesty or equity
   will stop them; these, in judgment, are permitted to carry their
   purpose in worldly things. So the plain, downright, upright man, that
   will not for fear or favour step a jot out of God's way, but keeps
   close to God's direction, is the truest and most perfect politician in
   the world. They that are thus severe to their purpose will be found the
   wisest men at length, not only in the world to come, but in this world;
   for it is our warping and going out of God's way that causeth our
   trouble and confusion of thoughts.

   2. The word teacheth us how to give the enemy no advantage and needless
   provocation. It is not enough to do good, but we must do it well, well
   timed and well ordered for every circumstance. Now God by his word
   teacheth his people so to do: Eccles. viii. 5, 6, Whoso keepeth the
   commandment shall feel no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth
   both time and judgment. Because to every purpose there is time and
   judgment; therefore the misery of man is great upon him.' To open this:
   The case there spoken of is provoking rulers and men that have power in
   their hand. Now a man that desires to keep the commandments of God
   shall be taught to walk so circumspectly that he shall not needlessly
   provoke the wrath of men to his own ruin, nor draw down the displeasure
   of God upon his head. God will show him the season when to act and when
   to forbear, a right time and a right manner, when to oppose by way of
   reproof and admonition, and when to hold his peace; he will find the
   fit time for doing of every business which God hath stated, and the
   ignorance of this time costs a man a great deal of misery; for he goes
   on, To every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery
   of man is great upon him.' When men are self-confident, or distempered
   with passion and prejudice, and consult not with God, they are carried
   on by headlong counsels, or moved with the impulsion of their own
   interest and corrupt affection into the mouth of danger. But he that
   makes conscience of his duty, and comes to the word of God without any
   private affection, he shall find time and judgment, those important
   circumstances, stated and determined, when to act and when not; they
   shall find a fair opportunity of providence either checking or leading
   them on to complete their resolutions. Many a good action miscarrieth
   for want of observing time and judgment, or consulting with God and his
   word about it; when to speak, when to hold our peace, to do or not do.
   Another scripture that speaks to this purpose, Eccles. vii. 16-18, Be
   not over-wise, over-foolish, over-just, over-wicked, that is the sum of
   what is spoken there; But he that feareth the Lord shrill come forth of
   them all.' A man may many times do a thing conscientiously and upon an
   opinion of duty, and thereby involve himself in trouble and danger when
   indeed there is no necessity so to do (that is it which Solomon means);
   therefore, to moderate zeal with prudence, that he may neither be
   remiss in his own interest nor passionately violent in the concernments
   of God; to preserve his heart from faulty and imprudent extremes, that
   we may sincerely keep unto duty, yet wisely decline danger. The word of
   God will teach us, if, in the fear of God, without being biassed and
   prepossessed with any corrupt aims, we come to take the direction of
   it, how to walk without offence. Well, then, you see this is the wisdom
   God teacheth those that give up themselves to the direction of the
   word; they are wiser than their enemies, and this is policy enough for
   a Christian. It teacheth us how to please God, and how to govern and
   order all our affairs, that we need not needlessly exasperate and
   provoke men to our own ruin. So that the word of God hath more wisdom
   to guide him than his enemies have subtle craft to ruin and ensnare
   him.

   Fourthly, The manner how we come to receive this benefit by the word,
   in that clause, They are ever with me.' These words may be interpreted
   as implying frequency of meditation, or presentness of counsel and
   direction, the one as the fruit of the other.

   1. Frequency of meditation, They are ever with me:' that is, often
   thought of by me, for my comfort and direction. A man that exerciseth
   himself in the commandments of God, there is his study and business.
   The king of Israel, for his comfort and direction, was to have the book
   of the law ever before him, Deut. xvii.; and Josh. i. 8, Thou shalt
   meditate therein day and night.' They are ever with me,' the law is
   always in my eye and heart. It is not a slight looking into them that
   will give us this wisdom, but an intimate constant acquaintance, when
   we are much in studying out God's mind.

   2. They are ever with me.' This may imply also that they should be a
   ready help. Such as derive their wisdom from without, they cannot have
   their counsellors always with them to give advice. But when a man hath
   gotten the word in his heart, he finds a ready help; lie hath a
   seasonable word to direct him in all difficulties, in all straits, and
   in all temptations, to teach him what to do against the burden of the
   present exigence, to teach him what to do and what to hope for.

   Having illustrated the words of the text, I now address myself to make
   good the proposition, that a child of God is wiser than his enemies. I
   shall do it in a twofold consideration:--

   1. They are wiser in their general choice.

   2. Wiser as to the particular controversy or enmity that is carried on
   against them by their enemies, as to those contests they have with
   their carnal enemies about the things of God; for I suppose these
   enemies here are not only such as had a private grudge, or carnal
   quarrels, but upon a public account; they have more wisdom by God to
   guide them than their enemies have craft to ruin them.

   First, Supposing these enemies to be carnal men (for such are the
   enemies of God's people), they are wiser than their enemies in their
   general choice and course of life. To determine this, let us see what
   is wisdom and what is folly. Saith Solomon, Eccles. vii. 25, I gave my
   heart to seek out wisdom, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of
   foolishness and madness.' Wisdom lies in three things--(1.) In fixing a
   right end; (2.) In the choice of apt and proper means; (3.) In the
   accurateness and diligence of our prosecution. And as to degrees of
   comparison, he is wiser than another that hath a better end, a better
   way, and is more dexterous and vigorous in pursuing the means that he
   may accomplish his ends. For instance, if we speak of worldly wisdom,
   the wisdom of the world is to fix the world for our scope: He that will
   be rich,' saith the apostle, and accordingly he that busieth himself
   with such means as will conduce to that purpose, that wholly gives up
   himself to worldly pursuits, and that with all his heart and vigour
   makes haste to be rich; this is the wisdom of the world: He shall not
   be innocent,' saith Solomon. Then there is heavenly wisdom when we make
   the enjoyment of God to be our scope, take the law of God for our rule,
   and make religion to be our business, avoiding evils, improving all
   occasions, sparing no cost nor trouble to compass such a holy end, that
   we may come to the enjoyment of the blessed God; this is spiritual
   wisdom. Then, among the children of God one is wiser than another as
   his intention is more fixed, as his means are more regular, or as his
   prosecution is more exact, uniform, and industrious. He that keeps
   close to his purpose of glorifying God and enjoying God, and he that
   understands more of his rule, he is the wiser man; and he that is more
   accurate and industrious, and with greater self-denial doth give
   himself up to God; as there are some that are more heavenly, more
   watchful, more diligent in the spiritual life than others. Well, then,
   if wisdom be to be determined by these things, the children of God,
   that are taught by the word of God, will be found to be wiser than
   their enemies and all carnal men.

   1. They are wiser as they have a nobler end, even the great end for
   which they were created, which is the enjoyment of God. Surely the
   higher ends any man hath, the wiser he is. Now there is none higher
   than God, for that which is the chiefest good that should be our utmost
   end. There is nothing good in itself and for itself, but only God. When
   we have God, we need not consider what further good to get by him, for
   to get him is enough. To look at anything as good in itself, without
   looking further what it is good for, is to put it in the place of God.
   Of all other things besides God we may say, What doth it serve for?
   what use may I put it to? what am I the better for it? But now, beyond
   God there is nothing to be sought; food and raiment, that is for
   health; and health, that is for service; and service for the glory of
   God. Everything riseth higher and higher, till it terminate in God.
   Certainly he is a wise man that lives up to the highest end, and makes
   this his scope to enjoy God. Well, now, he is a wise man that doth not
   mind trifles, but doth promote his proper, necessary, and great
   interest. This is our proper, great, and necessary interest, to make
   God our friend and heaven our portion; beyond these there is nothing
   more, for God is the chiefest good. Let me pursue it by another medium.
   Certainly a higher end is to be preferred before a subordinate, a
   general good before a particular, that which will yield all things,
   before that which will only yield us a limited or particular comfort.
   So he is the wiser man that chooseth God for his portion, for he that
   hath God shall inherit all things,' Rev. xxi. 7; and Mat. vi. 33, Seek
   ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all things shall
   be added:' that is a more universal good. Again, a profitable good is
   to be preferred before a pleasing. He that prefers a little pleasure
   before a solid good, you count him a fool; as Esau, that sold his
   birthright for a mess of pottage. And to part with all for a little
   temporal satisfaction, certainly that is a main folly. In short, a
   spiritual good is to be preferred before a corporal. Why? Because a man
   is more concerned as a soul than a body; therefore that wisdom that is
   only earthly, sensual, devilish,' as the wisdom is that is not from
   above, James iii. 15, this is all for the body or outward man; and he
   is called a fool that only provideth for his body, Luke xii. Why a
   fool? He had provided but for half his self, for the worser and more
   brutish part, and for that half but for a little while; therefore, Thou
   fool, this night,' &c. Then an eternal good should be preferred before
   a temporal. Man, that lives for ever, must have a happiness that lasts
   for ever. We live longer in the other world by far than here, therefore
   our care should be Tor that. Indeed, if a man did not live after death,
   and there were an end of him when he dies, it were the greatest wisdom
   to make the best use of his time here, to look no further than temporal
   things. Ay! but now to look after the world and neglect things to come
   is to be wise for the present, and be fools to all eternity. We cannot
   count that wisdom. Again, a necessary good is to be preferred before an
   arbitrary. Now one thing is necessary,' Luke x. 42. It is not necessary
   to be rich, to live in pleasure, to wallow in delights; within a while
   we shall not be a penny the better for these things. It is not
   necessary to have so great a plenty of worldly accommodations; it is
   not necessary to our happiness hereafter, nor to the comfort of our
   lives for the present to have so much here. Now, see who is the wiser
   man, he that looks no higher than to some subordinate end, or he that
   fixeth upon the last end? He that pitcheth upon some limited good, or
   he that pitcheth upon the most universal good that will yield him all
   things? He that pleaseth his fancy with toys, or he that looketh after
   a solid benefit? He that taketh care for his body, or he that minds his
   soul? He that mindeth that which is accessary or indifferent to his
   happiness, or he that mindeth that which is mainly necessary? He that
   looketh after a perishing vanity, or he that mindeth eternal happiness?
   Certainly if there be a God, and this God can do all things, and our
   happiness lies in the enjoyment of him, he is the wisest man that takes
   God for his portion, and makes it his business to keep in with him; and
   so doth a child of God. Thus wisdom is seen in fixing our aim.

   2. Wisdom lies in the choice of apt and proper means, and that is, to
   take the word for his rule; first God for his portion, then the word
   for his rule. To presume of the end, without using the means, is folly;
   therefore, next to a good end and scope, there must be a good path.
   Now, that we might not grope blindfold, and wander up and down in fond
   superstitions, God hath given us his word to instruct us in all things
   which concern our duty and our danger, and to make us every way wise to
   salvation, 2 Tim. iii. 15. If our happiness lies in the enjoyment of
   God, it is meet God should appoint the way how we should come to him.
   We should have been at a great loss if the Lord had given us grace to
   fix upon him as our end, if he had not given us a rule; we would not
   find out our way. But now God hath so exactly chalked it out, that a
   fool shall not err therein,' Isa. xxxv. 5; such plain directions as
   make wise the simple,' Ps. xix. 7; a plain rule, found out by the
   wisdom of God, and so stated for all, and peremptorily commanded to
   all, that the most simple that will give up themselves to God's
   direction they shall find it. Now who are wise? they that walk in the
   way of their own hearts, or they that will take God's direction in his
   word? those that will live according to the counsel of God's word, or
   those that will fashion their lives according to the course of this
   world, or according to the customs and examples of carnal men like
   themselves? Who is wiser? they that will inquire after the mind of God,
   who is wisdom itself, and can best judge of wisdom and folly? or they
   which shape their course according to the secular wisdom that prevails
   in the world, and which hath often failed in its end? Who the wiser
   man? he that hath taken God's counsel, and can never be deceived, or
   those that walk according to the course of this world, and find
   themselves wholly to be deceived? Ps. xlix. 13, This their way is their
   folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings.' They will imitate
   that folly which hath been so fatal and so mischievous to others, and
   think themselves happy. Many carnal men when they died, they
   all-to-be-fooled themselves, and lamented it that they had taken no
   more care to please God, and walked no more closely with him; that they
   had been more busy about worldly things than they had been for their
   precious and immortal souls. Therefore surely the children of God are
   wiser than their opposites, that give up themselves to the vanity of
   carnal pursuits.

   3. Wisdom lies in a vigorous prosecution of fit means to the best end,
   without which all is nothing. It is in vain to be sensible of our end
   and to be convinced of our way unless we mind to walk in it. Many
   carnal men will say that their happiness lies in the enjoyment of God,
   that the scriptures are the word of God, and his directions to attain
   that happiness; but their folly lies in this, that they have not a
   hearty consent to take this word for their rule, and give up themselves
   to the directions thereof: Prov. xvii. 16, Wherefore is there a price
   in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?'
   that is, such means and such opportunities given them to be happy, but
   that is a price in the hands of a fool, his heart hangs off from the
   way; and therefore here is the great effect of wisdom, when we do with
   all our hearts give up ourselves to God, that he may take his own way
   with us to make us happy for ever. Wisdom lies in obedience: Deut. iv.
   6, 7, Keep, therefore, and do them; for this is your wisdom,' &c. The
   world will say it is a simple course to be so nice, scrupulous, and
   precise; but God tells you it is your wisdom; and they that keep his
   statutes are a wise and understanding people. The devil fills us with
   all kind of prejudices against religion. To such as love ease, he
   represents difficulty, and the yoke of Christ to be a tedious yoke. If
   they love honour, he tells them of reproaches and disgrace. If they
   affect wisdom, he telleth them it is a low doctrine, beneath the
   sublimity of their parts and abilities. Now God assureth you this is
   your wisdom and understanding. So Job xxviii. 28, And unto man he said,
   Be hold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil
   is understanding.' There is an inquiry there in that chapter where
   wisdom is to be found; and it is resolved that it is nowhere to be
   found but in a strict obedience; not in the knowledge of the secrets of
   nature, not in the crafts and policies of the world, not in the plots
   and contrivances of the wicked, not in dexterity to get wealth, but in
   keeping God's commandments with all preciseness and care. Briefly, this
   dexterous and effectual prosecution of the means which lead to our end
   lies in three things, and so accordingly we may know wisdom: all these
   are called wisdom in scripture.

   [1.] In diligence and constant labour in the spiritual life. When a man
   makes religion his work, then he is a wise man, true to his end. There
   are a company of notional fools in the world that make religion their
   talk but do not make it their work, that can talk at as high a rate as
   others; they have a naked approbation of the things of God, but do not
   lie under the power and dominion of them: Eccles. x. 2, A wise man's
   heart is at his right hand.' A speech which seems to be contrary to the
   natural posture of the heart in the body, for the heart both of the one
   and the other is towards his left, but a wise man's heart is at his
   right hand. The right hand is that which is ready for action, so a wise
   man is ready and prepared to obey every good work. When men are
   diligent, serious, and hard at work for God, working out their
   salvation with fear and trembling,' then are they thoroughly wise.

   [2.] It lies in circumspection and watchfulness, when we are very
   heedful lest we be turned out of the way, and that we do not anything
   that is contrary to the will of God; therefore it is said, Eph. v. 15,
   See that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise.' When is a
   man a fool and when a wise man? When we are careful in all things to
   practise according to our light, to walk exactly according to the rules
   of God's word; these are the only true wise, whatever the world thinks
   of them. The more circumspect men are the more the world counts them
   fools, crazy brains, and judge it to be a fond scrupulosity to expose
   themselves to scorning and trouble, for that which they call a nicety;
   but the less circumspect, the more foolish; and the more wary and more
   desirous to see God's word, this is wisdom. That is the reason why it
   is said, The fear of the Lord prolongeth days,' Prov. x. 27. When men
   once come to stand in awe of God, when they are afraid to do anything
   that may displease God, and look for a warrant and rule, and desire to
   know the mind of God in every action, these are wise men.

   [3.] This wisdom lies in self-denial, or being at some cost or charge
   to compass our end. A godly man knows his end will recompense him
   sufficiently at last, the enjoyment of God will pay for all. It is a
   part of folly, not wisdom, to have great aims and designs, and loath to
   be at charges. He that will not be at the cost will never bring any
   weighty matter to pass. So he is called a wise merchant that sold all
   for the pearl of price, Mat. xiii. 46. Surely heaven is worth
   something; therefore, if you are called to despise the delights of the
   flesh, the honours of the world, to part with them, to be dead to
   temporal interests, it seems the greatest folly in the world, but
   indeed it is the truest wisdom. Saith Lactantius, Usually wisdom dwells
   at the sign of folly. Why? Because all wisdom puts men upon some
   self-denial. Carnal men count it folly for a man to be dead to his
   conveniences and worldly concernments, and that upon the pursuit of
   invisible things that lie in another world: but this indeed is the
   greatest wisdom. There is no wisdom without some self-denial. Carnal
   men have a self-denial, a cursed one; none deny themselves so much as
   they; they part with heaven, Christ, peace, and serenity of conscience,
   all the hopes, all the comforts of the Spirit, merely to please the
   flesh and gratify their interest in the world; all is to compass the
   pleasure, profits, and honours of the world, and so to dig for iron
   with mattocks of gold, waste precious things to compass them that are
   vile and contemptible.

   Well, then, let us see who are wise, they that are working out their
   salvation, or those that are pleasing the flesh? they that are wary and
   circumspect, and loath to break with God, or those that run blindfold
   upon the greatest dangers, and go like an ox to the slaughter, or as a
   fool to the correction of the stocks'? Prov. vii. 22. Who are wise?
   those that sell all for the pearl of price, or those that part with
   their birthright, all their hopes in God, and present sense of his
   love, for a little temporal convenience?

   Thus I have proved the first thing, namely, that the children of God
   are wiser than their enemies as to their general choice.
