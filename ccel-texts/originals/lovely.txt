Christ is to be Loved
     __________________________________________________________________

  "Yes, He is altogether lovely." Song of Songs 5:16.

   At the ninth verse of this chapter, you have a question put forth by
   the daughters of Jerusalem, "What is your beloved more than another
   beloved?" The spouse answers, "He is the chief among ten thousand." She
   then recounts many of the things she finds so excellent in her beloved
   and then concludes with these words that I have read: "Yes, he is
   altogether lovely."

   The words set forth the transcendent loveliness of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and naturally resolve themselves into three parts:

   1. Who he is.

   2. What he is.

   3. What he is like.

   First, Who he is: the Lord Jesus Christ, after whom she had been
   seeking, for whom she was overcome by love; concerning whom these
   daughters of Jerusalem had enquired: whom she had struggled to describe
   in his particular excellencies. He is the great and excellent subject
   of whom she here speaks.

   Secondly, What he is, or what she claims of him: That he is a lovely
   one. The Hebrew word, which is often translated "desires," means "to
   earnestly desire, covet, or long after that which is most pleasant,
   graceful, delectable and admirable." The original word is both in the
   abstract, and plural in number, which says that Christ is the very
   essence of all delights and pleasures, the very soul and substance of
   them. As all the rivers are gathered into the ocean, which is the
   meeting-place of all the waters in the world, so Christ is that ocean
   in which all true delights and pleasures meet.

   Thirdly, What he is like: He is altogether lovely, the every part to be
   desired. He is lovely when taken together, and in every part; as if she
   had said, "Look on him in what respect or particular you wish; cast
   your eye upon this lovely object, and view him any way, turn him in
   your serious thoughts which way you wish; consider his person, his
   offices, his works, or any other thing belonging to him; you will find
   him altogether lovely, There is nothing disagreeable in him, there is
   nothing lovely without him." Hence note,

   DOCTRINE: That Jesus Christ is the loveliest person souls can set their
   eyes upon: "Thou art fairer than the children of men." Psalm 45:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

  He is "Altogether Lovely"

   Here it is said of Jesus Christ, which cannot be said of any mere
   creature, that he is "altogether lovely." In opening this point I
   shall,

   1. Examine the importance of this phrase "altogether lovely."

   2. Show you in what respect Christ is so.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

What is Meant by "Altogether Lovely"

   Let us consider this excellent expression, and particularly reflect on
   what is contained in it, and you shall find this expression "altogether
   lovely."

   First, It excludes all unloveliness and disagreeableness from Jesus
   Christ. As a theologian long ago said, "There is nothing in him which
   is not loveable." The excellencies of Jesus Christ are perfectly
   exclusive of all their opposites; there is nothing of a contrary
   property or quality found in him to contaminate or devaluate his
   excellency. And in this respect Christ infinitely transcends the most
   excellent and loveliest of created things. Whatsoever loveliness is
   found in them, it is not without a bad aftertaste. The fairest pictures
   must have their shadows: The rarest and most brilliant gems must have
   dark backgrounds to set off their beauty; the best creature is but a
   bitter-sweet at best: If there is something pleasing, there is also
   something sour: if a person has every ability, both innate and
   acquired, to delight us, yet there is also some natural corruption
   intermixed with it to put us off. But it is not so in our altogether
   lovely Christ, his excellencies are pure and unmixed. He is a sea of
   sweetness without one drop of gall.

   Secondly, "Altogether lovely," i.e. There is nothing unlovely found in
   him, so all that is in him is wholly lovely. As every ray of God is
   precious, so every thing that is in Christ is precious: Who can weigh
   Christ in a pair of balances, and tell you what his worth is? "His
   price is above rubies, and all that thou canst desire is not to be
   compared with him," Prov. 8:11.

   Thirdly "Altogether lovely," i.e. He embraces all things that are
   lovely: he seals up the sum of all loveliness. Things that shine as
   single stars with a particular glory, all meet in Christ as a glorious
   constellation. Col. 1:19, "It pleased the Father that in him should all
   fullness dwell." Cast your eyes among all created beings, survey the
   universe: you will observe strength in one, beauty in a second,
   faithfulness in a third, wisdom in a fourth; but you shall find none
   excelling in them all as Christ does. Bread has one quality, water
   another, raiment another, medicine another; but none has them all in
   itself as Christ does. He is bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty,
   a garment to the naked, healing to the wounded; and whatever a soul can
   desire is found in him, 1 Cor. 1:30.

   Fourthly, "Altogether lovely," i.e. Nothing is lovely in opposition to
   him, or in separation from him. If he truly is altogether lovely, then
   whatsoever is opposite to him, or separate from him can have no
   loveliness in it. Take away Christ, and where is the loveliness of any
   enjoyment? The best creature-comfort apart from Christ is but a broken
   cistern. It cannot hold one drop of true comfort, Psalm 73:26. It is
   with the creature--the sweetest and loveliest creature--as with a
   beautiful image in the mirror: turn away the face and where is the
   image? Riches, honours, and comfortable relations are sweet when the
   face of Christ smiles upon us through them; but without him, what empty
   trifles are they all?

   Fifthly, "Altogether lovely," i.e. Transcending all created
   excellencies in beauty and loveliness. If you compare Christ and other
   things, no matter how lovely, no matter how excellent and desirable,
   Christ carries away all loveliness from them. "He is (as the apostle
   says) before all things," Col. 1:17. Not only before all things in
   time, nature, and order; but before all things in dignity, glory, and
   true excellence. In all things he must have the pre-eminence. Let us
   but compare Christ's excellence with the creature's in a few
   particulars, and how manifest will the transcendent loveliness of Jesus
   Christ appear! For,

   1. All other loveliness is derived and secondary; but the loveliness of
   Christ is original and primary. Angels and men, the world and all the
   desirable things in it, receive what excellence they crave from him.
   They are streams from the fountain. The farther any thing departs from
   its fountain and original, the less excellency there is in it.

   2. The loveliness and excellency of all other things, is only relative,
   consisting in its reference to Christ, and subservience to his glory.
   But Christ is lovely, considered absolutely in himself. He is desirable
   for himself; other things are desirable because of him.

   3. The beauty and loveliness of all other things are fading and
   perishing; but the loveliness of Christ is fresh for all eternity. The
   sweetness of the best created thing is a fading flower; if not before,
   yet certainly at death it must fade away. Job 4:21. "Doth not their
   excellency, which is in them, go away?" Yes, yes, whether they are the
   natural excellencies of the body, acquired endowments of the mind,
   lovely features, graceful qualities, or anything else we find
   attractive; all these like pleasant flowers are withered, faded, and
   destroyed by death. "But Christ is still the same, yesterday, today,
   and for ever," Heb. 13:8.

   4. The beauty and holiness of creatures are ensnaring and dangerous. A
   man may make an idol out of them, and indulge himself beyond the bounds
   of moderation with them, but there is no danger of excess in the love
   of Christ. The soul is then in the healthiest frame and temper when it
   is most overwhelmed by love to Christ, Song of Songs 5:8.

   5. The loveliness of every creature is of a confining and obstructing
   nature. Our esteem of it diminishes the closer we approach to it, or
   the longer we enjoy it. Creatures, like pictures, are fairest at a
   certain distance, but it is not so with Christ; the nearer the soul
   approaches him, and the longer it lives in the enjoyment of him, still
   the sweeter and more desirable he becomes.

   6. All other loveliness cannot satisfy the soul of man. There is not
   scope enough in any one created thing, or in all the natural universe
   of created things for the soul of man to reach out and expand; but the
   soul still feels itself confined and narrowed within those limits. This
   comes to pass from the inadequacy and unsuitableness of the creature to
   the nobler and more excellent soul of man. The soul is like a ship in a
   narrow river which does not have room to turn. It is always running
   aground and foundering in the shallows. But Jesus Christ is in every
   way sufficient to the vast desires of the soul; in him it has sea-room
   enough. In him the soul may spread all its sails with no fear of
   touching bottom. And thus you see what is the importance of this
   phrase, "Altogether lovely."
     __________________________________________________________________

How Christ is "Altogether Lovely"

   Secondly, Next I promised to show you in what respects Jesus Christ is
   altogether lovely:
     __________________________________________________________________

  He is Lovely in His Person

   First, He is altogether lovely in his person: he is Deity dwelling in
   flesh, John 1:14. The wonderful, perfect union of the divine and human
   nature in Christ renders him an object of admiration and adoration to
   both angels and men, 1 Tim. 3:16. God never presented to the world such
   a vision of glory before. Consider how the human nature of our Lord
   Jesus Christ is overflowing with all the graces of the Spirit, in such
   a way as never any of the saints was filled. O what a lovely picture
   does this paint of him! John 3:34, "God gives the Spirit [to him]
   without limit." This makes him "the most excellent of men and [his]
   lips have been anointed with grace," Psalm 45:2. If a small measure of
   grace in the saints makes them sweet and desirable companions, what
   must the riches of the Spirit of grace filling Jesus Christ without
   measure make him in the eyes of believers? O what a glory must it fix
   upon him!
     __________________________________________________________________

  He is Lovely in His Offices

   Secondly, He is altogether lovely in his offices: let us consider for a
   moment the suitability, fullness, and comforting nature of them.

   First, The suitability of the offices of Christ to the miseries of men.
   We cannot but adore the infinite wisdom of his receiving them. We are,
   by nature, blind and ignorant, at best but groping in the dim light of
   nature after God, Acts 17:27. Jesus Christ is a light to lighten the
   Gentiles, Isa. 49:6. When this great prophet came into the world, then
   did the day-spring from on high visit us, Luke 1:78. By nature we are
   alienated from, and at enmity against God; Christ comes into the world
   to be an atoning sacrifice, making peace by the blood of his cross,
   Col. 1:20. All the world, by nature, is in bondage and captivity to
   Satan, a miserable slavery. Christ comes with kingly power, to rescue
   sinners, as a prey from the mouth of the terrible one.

   Secondly, Let the fullness of his offices be also considered, which
   make him able "to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him,"
   Heb. 7:25. The three offices, comprising in them all that our souls do
   need, become an universal relief to all our distresses; and therefore,

   Thirdly, Unspeakably comforting must the offices of Christ be to the
   souls of sinners. If light be pleasant to our eyes, how pleasant is
   that light of life springing from the Sun of righteousness! Mal. 4:2.
   If a pardon be sweet to a condemned criminal, how sweet must the
   sprinkling the blood of Jesus be to the trembling conscience of a
   law-condemned sinner? If a rescue from a cruel tyrant is sweet to a
   poor captive, how sweet must it be to the ears of enslaved sinners, to
   hear the voice of liberty and deliverance proclaimed by Jesus Christ?
   Out of the several offices of Christ, as out of so many fountains, all
   the promises of the new covenant flow, as so many soul-refreshing
   streams of peace and joy. All the promises of illumination, counsel and
   direction flow out of Christ's prophetic office. All the promises of
   reconciliation, peace, pardon, and acceptation flow out of his priestly
   office, with the sweet streams of joy and spiritual comforts which
   accompany it. All the promises of converting, increasing, defending,
   directing, and supplying grace, flow out of the kingly office of
   Christ; indeed, all promises may be reduced to these three offices, so
   that Jesus Christ must be altogether lovely in his offices.
     __________________________________________________________________

  He is Lovely in His Relations.

   First, He is a lovely Redeemer, Isa. 61:1. He came to open the
   prison-doors to them that are bound. Needs must this Redeemer be a
   lovely one, if we consider the depth of misery from which he redeemed
   us, even "from the wrath to come," 1 Thess. 1:10. Consider the numbers
   redeemed, and the means of their redemption. Rev. 5:9, "And they sang a
   new song, saying, 'You are worthy to take the book, and to open the
   seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your
   blood, out of every kindred and tongue, and people and nation.'" He
   redeemed us not with silver and gold, but with his own precious blood,
   by way of price, 1 Pet. 1:18,19. with his out-stretched and glorious
   arm, by way of power, Col. 1:13. he redeemed us freely, Eph. 1:7, fully
   Rom. 8:1, at the right time, Gal. 4:4, and out of special and
   particular love, John 17:9. In a word, he has redeemed us for ever,
   never more to come into bondage, 1 Pet. 1:5. John 10:28. O how lovely
   is Jesus Christ in the relation of a Redeemer to God's elect!

   Secondly, He is a lovely bridegroom to all that he betroths to himself.
   How does the church glory in him, in the words following my text; "this
   is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem!"
   Heaven and earth cannot show anyone like him, which needs no fuller
   proof than the following particulars:

   1. That he betroths to himself, in mercy and in loving kindness, such
   deformed, defiled, and altogether unworthy souls as we are. We have no
   beauty, no goodness to make us desirable in his eyes; all the origins
   of his love to us are in his own breast, Deut. 7:7. He chooses us, not
   because we were, but in order that he might make us lovely Eph. 5:27.
   He came to us when we lay in our blood, and said unto us, "Live"; and
   that was the time of love, Ezek. 16:6.

   2. He expects no restitution from us, and yet gives himself, and all
   that he has, to us. Our poverty cannot enrich him, but he made himself
   poor to enrich us, 2 Cor. 8:9. 1 Cor. 3:22.

   3. No husband loves the wife of his bosom, as much as Christ loved his
   people, Eph. 5:25. He loved the church and gave him self for it.

   4. No one bears with weaknesses and provocations as Christ does; the
   church is called "the Lamb's wife," Rev. 21:9.

   5. No husband is so undying and everlasting a husband as Christ is;
   death separates all other relations, but the soul's union with Christ
   is not dissolved in the grave. Indeed, the day of a believer's death is
   his marriage day, the day of his fullest enjoyment of Christ. No
   husband can say to his wife, what Christ says to the believer, "I will
   never leave you, nor forsake you," Heb. 13:5.

   6. No bridegroom enriches his bride with such honours by marriage, as
   Christ does; he makes them related to God as their father, and from
   that day the mighty and glorious angels think it no dishonour to be
   their servants, Heb. 1:14. The angels will admire the beauty and glory
   of the spouse of Christ, Rev. 21:9.

   7. No marriage was ever consummated with such triumphal proceedings as
   the marriage of Christ and believers shall be in heaven, Psalm
   45:14,15. "She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needle-work,
   the virgins, her companions that follow her, shall be brought unto
   thee; with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; they shall
   enter into the king's palace." Among the Jews, the marriage-house was
   called the house of praise; there was joy upon all hands, but nothing
   like the joy that will be in heaven when believers, the spouse of
   Christ, shall be brought there. God the Father will rejoice to behold
   the blessed accomplishment and confirmation of those glorious plans of
   his love. Jesus Christ, the Bridegroom will rejoice to see the travail
   of his soul, the blessed birth and product of all his bitter pains and
   agonies, Isa. 53:11. The Holy Spirit will rejoice to see the completion
   and perfection of that sanctifying design which was committed to his
   hand, 2 Cor. 5:5, to see those souls whom he once found as rough
   stones, now to shine as the bright, polished stones of the spiritual
   temple. Angels will rejoice: great was the joy when the foundation of
   this design was laid, in the incarnation of Christ, Luke 2:13. Great
   therefore must their joy be, when the top-stone is set up with
   shouting, crying, "Grace, grace." The saints themselves shall rejoice
   unspeakably, when they shall enter into the King's palace, and be
   forever with the Lord, 1 Thes. 4:17. Indeed there will be joy on all
   hands, except among the devils and damned, who shall gnash their teeth
   with envy at the everlasting advancement and glory of believers. Thus
   Christ is altogether lovely, in the relation of a Bridegroom.

   Thirdly, Christ is altogether lovely, in the relation of an Advocate. 1
   John 2:1, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous, and he is the Propitiation." It is he that pleads
   the cause of believers in heaven. He appears for them in the presence
   of God, to prevent any new alienation, and to continue the state of
   friendship and peace between God and us. In this relation Christ is
   altogether lovely. For,

   1. He makes our cause his own, and acts for us in heaven, as if for
   himself, Heb. 4:15. He is touched with a most tender understanding of
   our troubles and dangers, and is not only one with us by way of
   representation, but also one with us in respect of sympathy and
   affection.

   2. Christ our Advocate tracks our cause and business in heaven, as his
   great and primary design and business. For this reason in Hebrews 7:25.
   he is said to "live for ever to make intercession for us." It is as if
   our concerns were so attended to by him there, that all the glory and
   honour which is paid him in heaven would not divert him one moment from
   our business.

   3. He pleads the cause of believers by his blood. Unlike other
   advocates, it is not enough for him to lay out only words, which is a
   cheaper way of pleading; but he pleads for us by the voice of his own
   blood, as in Heb. 12:24, where we are said to be come "to the blood of
   sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel." Every wound
   he received for us on earth is a mouth opened to plead with God on our
   behalf in heaven. And hence it is, that in Rev. 5:6 he is represented
   standing before God, as a lamb that had been slain; as it were
   exhibiting and revealing in heaven those deadly wounds received on
   earth from the justice of God, on our account. Other advocates spend
   their breath, Christ spends his blood.

   4. He pleads the cause of believers freely. Other advocates plead for
   reward, and empty the purses, while they plead the causes of their
   clients.

   5. In a word, he obtains for us all the mercies for which he pleads. No
   cause miscarries in his hand, which he undertakes, Rom. 8:33, 34. what
   a lovely Advocate is Christ for believers!

   Fourthly, Christ is altogether lovely in the relation of a friend, for
   in this relation he is pleased to acknowledge his people, Luke 12:4, 5.
   There are certain things in which one friend manifests his affection
   and friendship to another, but there is not one like Christ. For,

   1. No friend is so open-hearted to his friend as Christ is to his
   people: he reveals the very counsels and secrets of his heart to them.
   John 15:15. "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knows
   not what his Lord does; but I have called you friends; for all things
   that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.

   2. No friend in the world is so generous and bountiful to his friend,
   as Jesus Christ is to believers; he parts with his very blood for them;
   "Greater love (he says) has no man than this, that a man lay down his
   life for his friends," John 15:13. He has exhausted the precious
   treasures of his invaluable blood to pay our debts. O what a lovely
   friend is Jesus Christ to believers!

   3. No friend sympathizes so tenderly with his friend in affliction, as
   Jesus Christ does with his friends: "In all our afflictions he is
   afflicted," Heb. 4:15. He feels all our sorrows, needs and burdens as
   his own. This is why it is said that the sufferings of believers are
   called the sufferings of Christ, Col. 1:24.

   4. No friend in the world takes that contentment in his friends, as
   Jesus Christ does in believers. Song of Songs 4:9. "You have ravished
   my heart, (he says to the spouse) you have ravished my heart with one
   of your eyes, with one chain of your neck." The Hebrew, here rendered
   "ravished," signifies to puff up, or to make one proud: how the Lord
   Jesus is pleased to glory in his people! How he is taken and delighted
   with those gracious ornaments which himself bestows upon them! There is
   no friend so lovely as Christ.

   5. No friend in the world loves his friend with as impassioned and
   strong affection as Jesus Christ loves believers. Jacob loved Rachel,
   and endured for her sake the parching heat of summer and cold of
   winter; but Christ endured the storms of the wrath of God, the heat of
   his indignation, for our sakes. David manifested his love to Absalom,
   in wishing, "O that I had died for you!" Christ manifested his love to
   us, not in wishes that he had died, but in death itself, in our stead,
   and for our sakes.

   6. No friend in the world is so constant and unchangeable in friendship
   as Christ is. John 13:1, "Having loved his own which were in the world,
   he loved them unto the end." He bears with millions of provocations and
   wrongs, and yet will not break friendship with his people. Peter denied
   him, yet he will not disown him; but after his resurrection he says,
   "Go, tell the disciples, and tell Peter." Let him not think he has
   forfeited by that sin of his, his interest in me. Though he denied me,
   I will not disown him, Mark 16:7. how lovely is Christ in the relation
   of a friend!

   I might further show you the loveliness of Christ in his ordinances and
   in his providences, in his communion with us and communications to us,
   but there is no end of the account of Christ's loveliness: I will
   rather choose to press believers to their duties towards this
   altogether lovely Christ, which I shall briefly conclude in a few
   words.
     __________________________________________________________________

APPLICATION

   1. Is Jesus Christ altogether lovely? Then I beseech you set your souls
   upon this lovely Jesus. I am sure such an object as has been here
   represented, would compel love from the coldest breast and hardest
   heart. Away with those empty nothings, away with this vain deceitful
   world, which deserves not the thousandth part of the love you give it.
   Let all stand aside and give way to Christ. O if only you knew his
   worth and excellency, what he is in himself, what he has done for you,
   and deserved from you, you would need no arguments of mine to persuade
   you to love him!

   2. Esteem nothing lovely except as it is enjoyed in Christ, or used for
   the sake of Christ. Love nothing for itself, love nothing separate from
   Jesus Christ. In two things we all sin in love of created things. We
   sin in the excess of our affections, loving them above the proper value
   of mere created things. We also sin in the inordinacy of our
   affections, that is to say we give our love for created things a
   priority it should never have.

   3. Let us all be humbled for the corruption of our hearts that are so
   eager in their affections for vanities and trifles and so hard to be
   persuaded to the love of Christ, who is altogether lovely. O how many
   pour out streams of love and delight upon the vain and empty created
   thing; while no arguments can draw forth one drop of love from their
   stubborn and unbelieving hearts to Jesus Christ! I have read of one
   Joannes Mollius, who was observed to go often alone, and weep bitterly;
   and being pressed by a friend to know the cause of his troubles, said
   "O! it grieves me that I cannot bring this heart of mine to love Jesus
   Christ more fervently."

   4. Represent Christ to the world as he is, by your behaviour towards
   him. Is he altogether lovely? Let all the world see and know that he is
   so, by your delights in him and communion with him; zeal for him, and
   readiness to part with any other lovely thing upon his account.
   Proclaim his excellencies to the world, as the spouse did in these
   verses. Persuade them how much your beloved is better than any other
   beloved. Show his glorious excellencies as you speak of him; hold him
   forth to others, as he is in himself: altogether lovely. See that you
   "walk worthy of him unto all well pleasing," Col. 1:10. "Show forth the
   praises of Christ," 1 Pet. 2:19. Let not that "worthy name be
   blasphemed through you," James 2:7. He is glorious in himself, and he
   is sure to put glory upon you; take heed that you do not put shame and
   dishonours upon him; he has committed his honour to you, do not betray
   that trust.

   Never be ashamed to be counted as a Christian: he is altogether lovely;
   he can never be a shame to you; it will be your great sin to be ashamed
   of him. Some men glory in their shame; do not let yourself be ashamed
   of your glory. If you will be ashamed of Christ now, he will be ashamed
   of you when he shall appear in his own glory, and the glory of all his
   holy angels. Be ashamed of nothing but sin; and among other sins, be
   ashamed especially for this sin, that you have no more love for him who
   is altogether lovely.

   6. Be willing to leave every thing that is lovely upon earth, in order
   that you may be with the altogether lovely Lord Jesus Christ in heaven.
   Lift up your voices with the bride, Rev. 20:20 "Come Lord Jesus, come
   quickly." It is true, you must pass through the pangs of death into his
   intimacy and enjoyment; but surely it is worth suffering much more than
   that to be with this lovely Jesus. "The Lord direct your hearts into
   the love of God, and the patient waiting for Jesus Christ," 2 Thes.
   3:5.

   7. Let the loveliness of Christ draw all men to him. Is loveliness in
   the creature so attractive? And can the transcendent loveliness of
   Christ draw none? O the blindness of man! If you see no beauty in
   Christ that causes you to desire him, it is because the god of this
   world has blinded your minds.

   8. Strive to be Christ-like, if ever you would be lovely in the eyes of
   God and man. Certainly, my brethren, it is only the Spirit of Christ
   within you, and the beauty of Christ upon you, which can make you
   lovely persons. The more you resemble him in holiness, the more will
   you show of true excellence and loveliness; and the more frequent and
   spiritual your communication and communion with Christ is, the more of
   the beauty and loveliness of Christ will be stamped upon your spirits,
   changing you into the same image, from glory to glory. Amen.
