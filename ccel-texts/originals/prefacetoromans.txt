Translator's Note

   The material between square brackets is explanatory in nature and is
   not part of Luther's preface. The terms "just, justice, justify" in
   this piece are synonymous with the terms "righteous, righteousness,
   make righteous." Both sets of English words are common translations of
   German "gerecht" and related words. A similar situation exists with the
   word "faith"; it is synonymous with "belief." Both words can be used to
   translate German "Glaube." Thus, "We are justified by faith" translates
   the same original German sentence as does "We are made righteous by
   belief."

Preface to the Letter of St. Paul to the Romans

   This letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It
   is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian's while not only to
   memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as
   though it were the daily bread of the soul. It is impossible to read or
   to meditate on this letter too much or too well. The more one deals
   with it, the more precious it becomes and the better it tastes.
   Therefore I want to carry out my service and, with this preface,
   provide an introduction to the letter, insofar as God gives me the
   ability, so that every one can gain the fullest possible understanding
   of it. Up to now it has been darkened by glosses [explanatory notes and
   comments which accompany a text] and by many a useless comment, but it
   is in itself a bright light, almost bright enough to illumine the
   entire Scripture.

   To begin with, we have to become familiar with the vocabulary of the
   letter and know what St. Paul means by the words law, sin, grace,
   faith, justice, flesh, spirit, etc. Otherwise there is no use in
   reading it.

   You must not understand the word law here in human fashion, i.e., a
   regulation about what sort of works must be done or must not be done.
   That's the way it is with human laws: you satisfy the demands of the
   law with works, whether your heart is in it or not. God judges what is
   in the depths of the heart. Therefore his law also makes demands on the
   depths of the heart and doesn't let the heart rest content in works;
   rather it punishes as hypocrisy and lies all works done apart from the
   depths of the heart. All human beings are called liars (Psalm 116),
   since none of them keeps or can keep God's law from the depths of the
   heart. Everyone finds inside himself an aversion to good and a craving
   for evil. Where there is no free desire for good, there the heart has
   not set itself on God's law. There also sin is surely to be found and
   the deserved wrath of God, whether a lot of good works and an honorable
   life appear outwardly or not.

   Therefore in chapter 2, St. Paul adds that the Jews are all sinners and
   says that only the doers of the law are justified in the sight of God.
   What he is saying is that no one is a doer of the law by works. On the
   contrary, he says to them, "You teach that one should not commit
   adultery, and you commit adultery. You judge another in a certain
   matter and condemn yourselves in that same matter, because you do the
   very same thing that you judged in another." It is as if he were
   saying, "Outwardly you live quite properly in the works of the law and
   judge those who do not live the same way; you know how to teach
   everybody. You see the speck in another's eye but do not notice the
   beam in your own."

   Outwardly you keep the law with works out of fear of punishment or love
   of gain. Likewise you do everything without free desire and love of the
   law; you act out of aversion and force. You'd rather act otherwise if
   the law didn't exist. It follows, then, that you, in the depths of your
   heart, are an enemy of the law. What do you mean, therefore, by
   teaching another not to steal, when you, in the depths of your heart,
   are a thief and would be one outwardly too, if you dared. (Of course,
   outward work doesn't last long with such hypocrites.) So then, you
   teach others but not yourself; you don't even know what you are
   teaching. You've never understood the law rightly. Furthermore, the law
   increases sin, as St. Paul says in chapter 5. That is because a person
   becomes more and more an enemy of the law the more it demands of him
   what he can't possibly do.

   In chapter 7, St. Paul says, "The law is spiritual." What does that
   mean? If the law were physical, then it could be satisfied by works,
   but since it is spiritual, no one can satisfy it unless everything he
   does springs from the depths of the heart. But no one can give such a
   heart except the Spirit of God, who makes the person be like the law,
   so that he actually conceives a heartfelt longing for the law and
   henceforward does everything, not through fear or coercion, but from a
   free heart. Such a law is spiritual since it can only be loved and
   fulfilled by such a heart and such a spirit. If the Spirit is not in
   the heart, then there remain sin, aversion and enmity against the law,
   which in itself is good, just and holy.

   You must get used to the idea that it is one thing to do the works of
   the law and quite another to fulfill it. The works of the law are every
   thing that a person does or can do of his own free will and by his own
   powers to obey the law. But because in doing such works the heart
   abhors the law and yet is forced to obey it, the works are a total loss
   and are completely useless. That is what St. Paul means in chapter 3
   when he says, "No human being is justified before God through the works
   of the law." From this you can see that the schoolmasters [i.e., the
   scholastic theologians] and sophists are seducers when they teach that
   you can prepare yourself for grace by means of works. How can anybody
   prepare himself for good by means of works if he does no good work
   except with aversion and constraint in his heart? How can such a work
   please God, if it proceeds from an averse and unwilling heart?

   But to fulfill the law means to do its work eagerly, lovingly and
   freely, without the constraint of the law; it means to live well and in
   a manner pleasing to God, as though there were no law or punishment. It
   is the Holy Spirit, however, who puts such eagerness of unconstained
   love into the heart, as Paul says in chapter 5. But the Spirit is given
   only in, with, and through faith in Jesus Christ, as Paul says in his
   introduction. So, too, faith comes only through the word of God, the
   Gospel, that preaches Christ: how he is both Son of God and man, how he
   died and rose for our sake. Paul says all this in chapters 3, 4 and 10.

   That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law; faith
   it is that brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ. The
   Spirit, in turn, renders the heart glad and free, as the law demands.
   Then good works proceed from faith itself. That is what Paul means in
   chapter 3 when, after he has thrown out the works of the law, he sounds
   as though the wants to abolish the law by faith. No, he says, we uphold
   the law through faith, i.e. we fulfill it through faith.

   Sin in the Scriptures means not only external works of the body but
   also all those movements within us which bestir themselves and move us
   to do the external works, namely, the depth of the heart with all its
   powers. Therefore the word do should refer to a person's completely
   falling into sin. No external work of sin happens, after all, unless a
   person commit himself to it completely, body and soul. In particular,
   the Scriptures see into the heart, to the root and main source of all
   sin: unbelief in the depth of the heart. Thus, even as faith alone
   makes just and brings the Spirit and the desire to do good external
   works, so it is only unbelief which sins and exalts the flesh and
   brings desire to do evil external works. That's what happened to Adam
   and Eve in Paradise (cf. Genesis 3).

   That is why only unbelief is called sin by Christ, as he says in John,
   chapter 16, "The Spirit will punish the world because of sin, because
   it does not believe in me." Furthermore, before good or bad works
   happen, which are the good or bad fruits of the heart, there has to be
   present in the heart either faith or unbelief, the root, sap and chief
   power of all sin. That is why, in the Scriptures, unbelief is called
   the head of the serpent and of the ancient dragon which the offspring
   of the woman, i.e. Christ, must crush, as was promised to Adam (cf.
   Genesis 3). Grace and gift differ in that grace actually denotes God's
   kindness or favor which he has toward us and by which he is disposed to
   pour Christ and the Spirit with his gifts into us, as becomes clear
   from chapter 5, where Paul says, "Grace and gift are in Christ, etc."
   The gifts and the Spirit increase daily in us, yet they are not
   complete, since evil desires and sins remain in us which war against
   the Spirit, as Paul says in chapter 7, and in Galations, chapter 5. And
   Genesis, chapter 3, proclaims the enmity between the offspring of the
   woman and that of the serpent. But grace does do this much: that we are
   accounted completely just before God. God's grace is not divided into
   bits and pieces, as are the gifts, but grace takes us up completely
   into God's favor for the sake of Christ, our intercessor and mediator,
   so that the gifts may begin their work in us.

   In this way, then, you should understand chapter 7, where St. Paul
   portrays himself as still a sinner, while in chapter 8 he says that,
   because of the incomplete gifts and because of the Spirit, there is
   nothing damnable in those who are in Christ. Because our flesh has not
   been killed, we are still sinners, but because we believe in Christ and
   have the beginnings of the Spirit, God so shows us his favor and mercy,
   that he neither notices nor judges such sins. Rather he deals with us
   according to our belief in Christ until sin is killed.

   Faith is not that human illusion and dream that some people think it
   is. When they hear and talk a lot about faith and yet see that no moral
   improvement and no good works result from it, they fall into error and
   say, "Faith is not enough. You must do works if you want to be virtuous
   and get to heaven." The result is that, when they hear the Gospel, they
   stumble and make for themselves with their own powers a concept in
   their hearts which says, "I believe." This concept they hold to be true
   faith. But since it is a human fabrication and thought and not an
   experience of the heart, it accomplishes nothing, and there follows no
   improvement.

   Faith is a work of God in us, which changes us and brings us to birth
   anew from God (cf. John 1). It kills the old Adam, makes us completely
   different people in heart, mind, senses, and all our powers, and brings
   the Holy Spirit with it. What a living, creative, active powerful thing
   is faith! It is impossible that faith ever stop doing good. Faith
   doesn't ask whether good works are to be done, but, before it is asked,
   it has done them. It is always active. Whoever doesn't do such works is
   without faith; he gropes and searches about him for faith and good
   works but doesn't know what faith or good works are. Even so, he
   chatters on with a great many words about faith and good works.

   Faith is a living, unshakeable confidence in God's grace; it is so
   certain, that someone would die a thousand times for it. This kind of
   trust in and knowledge of God's grace makes a person joyful, confident,
   and happy with regard to God and all creatures. This is what the Holy
   Spirit does by faith. Through faith, a person will do good to everyone
   without coercion, willingly and happily; he will serve everyone, suffer
   everything for the love and praise of God, who has shown him such
   grace. It is as impossible to separate works from faith as burning and
   shining from fire. Therefore be on guard against your own false ideas
   and against the chatterers who think they are clever enough to make
   judgements about faith and good works but who are in reality the
   biggest fools. Ask God to work faith in you; otherwise you will remain
   eternally without faith, no matter what you try to do or fabricate.

   Now justice is just such a faith. It is called God's justice or that
   justice which is valid in God's sight, because it is God who gives it
   and reckons it as justice for the sake of Christ our Mediator. It
   influences a person to give to everyone what he owes him. Through faith
   a person becomes sinless and eager for God's commands. Thus he gives
   God the honor due him and pays him what he owes him. He serves people
   willingly with the means available to him. In this way he pays everyone
   his due. Neither nature nor free will nor our own powers can bring
   about such a justice, for even as no one can give himself faith, so too
   he cannot remove unbelief. How can he then take away even the smallest
   sin? Therefore everything which takes place outside faith or in
   unbelief is lie, hypocrisy and sin (Romans 14), no matter how smoothly
   it may seem to go.

   You must not understand flesh here as denoting only unchastity or
   spirit as denoting only the inner heart. Here St. Paul calls flesh (as
   does Christ in John 3) everything born of flesh, i.e. the whole human
   being with body and soul, reason and senses, since everything in him
   tends toward the flesh. That is why you should know enough to call that
   person "fleshly" who, without grace, fabricates, teaches and chatters
   about high spiritual matters. You can learn the same thing from
   Galatians, chapter 5, where St. Paul calls heresy and hatred works of
   the flesh. And in Romans, chapter 8, he says that, through the flesh,
   the law is weakened. He says this, not of unchastity, but of all sins,
   most of all of unbelief, which is the most spiritual of vices.

   On the other hand, you should know enough to call that person
   "spiritual" who is occupied with the most outward of works as was
   Christ, when he washed the feet of the disciples, and Peter, when he
   steered his boat and fished. So then, a person is "flesh" who, inwardly
   and outwardly, lives only to do those things which are of use to the
   flesh and to temporal existence. A person is "spirit" who, inwardly and
   outwardly, lives only to do those things which are of use to the spirit
   and to the life to come.

   Unless you understand these words in this way, you will never
   understand either this letter of St. Paul or any book of the
   Scriptures. Be on guard, therefore against any teacher who uses these
   words differently, no matter who he be, whether Jerome, Augustine,
   Ambrose, Origen or anyone else as great as or greater than they. Now
   let us turn to the letter itself.

   The first duty of a preacher of the Gospel is, through his revealing of
   the law and of sin, to rebuke and to turn into sin everything in life
   that does not have the Spirit and faith in Christ as its base. [Here
   and elsewhere in Luther's preface, as indeed in Romans itself, it is
   not clear whether "spirit" has the meaning "Holy Spirit" or "spiritual
   person," as Luther has previously defined it.] Thereby he will lead
   people to a recognition of their miserable condition, and thus they
   will become humble and yearn for help. This is what St. Paul does. He
   begins in chapter 1 by rebuking the gross sins and unbelief which are
   in plain view, as were (and still are) the sins of the pagans, who live
   without God's grace. He says that, through the Gospel, God is revealing
   his wrath from heaven upon all mankind because of the godless and
   unjust lives they live. For, although they know and recognize day by
   day that there is a God, yet human nature in itself, without grace, is
   so evil that it neither thanks nor honors God. This nature blinds
   itself and continually falls into wickedness, even going so far as to
   commit idolatry and other horrible sins and vices. It is unashamed of
   itself and leaves such things unpunished in others.

   In chapter 2, St. Paul extends his rebuke to those who appear outwardly
   pious or who sin secretly. Such were the Jews, and such are all
   hypocrites still, who live virtuous lives but without eagerness and
   love; in their heart they are enemies of God's law and like to judge
   other people. That's the way with hypocrites: they think that they are
   pure but are actually full of greed, hate, pride and all sorts of filth
   (cf. Matthew 23). These are they who despise God's goodness and, by
   their hardness of heart, heap wrath upon themselves. Thus Paul explains
   the law rightly when he lets no one remain without sin but proclaims
   the wrath of God to all who want to live virtuously by nature or by
   free will. He makes them out to be no better than public sinners; he
   says they are hard of heart and unrepentant.

   In chapter 3, Paul lumps both secret and public sinners together: the
   one, he says, is like the other; all are sinners in the sight of God.
   Besides, the Jews had God's word, even though many did not believe in
   it. But still God's truth and faith in him are not thereby rendered
   useless. St. Paul introduces, as an aside, the saying from Psalm 51,
   that God remains true to his words. Then he returns to his topic and
   proves from Scripture that they are all sinners and that no one becomes
   just through the works of the law but that God gave the law only so
   that sin might be perceived.

   Next St. Paul teaches the right way to be virtuous and to be saved; he
   says that they are all sinners, unable to glory in God. They must,
   however, be justified through faith in Christ, who has merited this for
   us by his blood and has become for us a mercy seat [cf. Exodus 25:17,
   Leviticus 16:14ff, and John 2:2] in the presence of God, who forgives
   us all our previous sins. In so doing, God proves that it is his
   justice alone, which he gives through faith, that helps us, the justice
   which was at the appointed time revealed through the Gospel and,
   previous to that, was witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets.
   Therefore the law is set up by faith, but the works of the law, along
   with the glory taken in them, are knocked down by faith. [As with the
   term "spirit," the word "law" seems to have for Luther, and for St.
   Paul, two meanings. Sometimes it means "regulation about what must be
   done or not done," as in the third paragraph of this preface; sometimes
   it means "the Torah," as in the previous sentence. And sometimes it
   seems to have both meanings, as in what follows.]

   In chapters 1 to 3, St. Paul has revealed sin for what it is and has
   taught the way of faith which leads to justice. Now in chapter 4 he
   deals with some objections and criticisms. He takes up first the one
   that people raise who, on hearing that faith make just without works,
   say, "What? Shouldn't we do any good works?" Here St. Paul holds up
   Abraham as an example. He says, "What did Abraham accomplish with his
   good works? Were they all good for nothing and useless?" He concludes
   that Abraham was made righteous apart from all his works by faith
   alone. Even before the "work" of his circumcision, Scripture praises
   him as being just on account of faith alone (cf. Genesis 15). Now if
   the work of his circumcision did nothing to make him just, a work that
   God had commanded him to do and hence a work of obedience, then surely
   no other good work can do anything to make a person just. Even as
   Abraham's circumcision was an outward sign with which he proved his
   justice based on faith, so too all good works are only outward signs
   which flow from faith and are the fruits of faith; they prove that the
   person is already inwardly just in the sight of God.

   St. Paul verifies his teaching on faith in chapter 3 with a powerful
   example from Scripture. He calls as witness David, who says in Psalm 32
   that a person becomes just without works but doesn't remain without
   works once he has become just. Then Paul extends this example and
   applies it against all other works of the law. He concludes that the
   Jews cannot be Abraham's heirs just because of their blood relationship
   to him and still less because of the works of the law. Rather, they
   have to inherit Abrahams's faith if they want to be his real heirs,
   since it was prior to the Law of Moses and the law of circumcision that
   Abraham became just through faith and was called a father of all
   believers. St. Paul adds that the law brings about more wrath than
   grace, because no one obeys it with love and eagerness. More disgrace
   than grace come from the works of the law. Therefore faith alone can
   obtain the grace promised to Abraham. Examples like these are written
   for our sake, that we also should have faith.

   In chapter 5, St. Paul comes to the fruits and works of faith, namely:
   joy, peace, love for God and for all people; in addition: assurance,
   steadfastness, confidence, courage, and hope in sorrow and suffering.
   All of these follow where faith is genuine, because of the overflowing
   good will that God has shown in Christ: he had him die for us before we
   could ask him for it, yes, even while we were still his enemies. Thus
   we have established that faith, without any good works, makes just. It
   does not follow from that, however, that we should not do good works;
   rather it means that morally upright works do not remain lacking. About
   such works the "works-holy" people know nothing; they invent for
   themselves their own works in which are neither peace nor joy nor
   assurance nor love nor hope nor steadfastness nor any kind of genuine
   Christian works or faith.

   Next St. Paul makes a digression, a pleasant little side-trip, and
   relates where both sin and justice, death and life come from. He
   opposes these two: Adam and Christ. What he wants to say is that
   Christ, a second Adam, had to come in order to make us heirs of his
   justice through a new spiritual birth in faith, just as the old Adam
   made us heirs of sin through the old fleshy birth.

   St. Paul proves, by this reasoning, that a person cannot help himself
   by his works to get from sin to justice any more than he can prevent
   his own physical birth. St. Paul also proves that the divine law, which
   should have been well-suited, if anything was, for helping people to
   obtain justice, not only was no help at all when it did come, but it
   even increased sin. Evil human nature, consequently, becomes more
   hostile to it; the more the law forbids it to indulge its own desires,
   the more it wants to. Thus the law makes Christ all the more necessary
   and demands more grace to help human nature.

   In chapter 6, St. Paul takes up the special work of faith, the struggle
   which the spirit wages against the flesh to kill off those sins and
   desires that remain after a person has been made just. He teaches us
   that faith doesn't so free us from sin that we can be idle, lazy and
   self-assured, as though there were no more sin in us. Sin is there,
   but, because of faith that struggles against it, God does not reckon
   sin as deserving damnation. Therefore we have in our own selves a
   lifetime of work cut out for us; we have to tame our body, kill its
   lusts, force its members to obey the spirit and not the lusts. We must
   do this so that we may conform to the death and resurrection of Christ
   and complete our Baptism, which signifies a death to sin and a new life
   of grace. Our aim is to be completely clean from sin and then to rise
   bodily with Christ and live forever.

   St. Paul says that we can accomplish all this because we are in grace
   and not in the law. He explains that to be "outside the law" is not the
   same as having no law and being able to do what you please. No, being
   "under the law" means living without grace, surrounded by the works of
   the law. Then surely sin reigns by means of the law, since no one is
   naturally well-disposed toward the law. That very condition, however,
   is the greatest sin. But grace makes the law lovable to us, so there is
   then no sin any more, and the law is no longer against us but one with
   us.

   This is true freedom from sin and from the law; St. Paul writes about
   this for the rest of the chapter. He says it is a freedom only to do
   good with eagerness and to live a good life without the coercion of the
   law. This freedom is, therefore, a spiritual freedom which does not
   suspend the law but which supplies what the law demands, namely
   eagerness and love. These silence the law so that it has no further
   cause to drive people on and make demands of them. It's as though you
   owed something to a moneylender and couldn't pay him. You could be rid
   of him in one of two ways: either he would take nothing from you and
   would tear up his account book, or a pious man would pay for you and
   give you what you needed to satisfy your debt. That's exactly how
   Christ freed us from the law. Therefore our freedom is not a wild,
   fleshy freedom that has no obligation to do anything. On the contrary,
   it is a freedom that does a great deal, indeed everything, yet is free
   of the law's demands and debts.

   In chapter 7, St. Paul confirms the foregoing by an analogy drawn from
   married life. When a man dies, the wife is free; the one is free and
   clear of the other. It is not the case that the woman may not or should
   not marry another man; rather she is now for the first time free to
   marry someone else. She could not do this before she was free of her
   first husband. In the same way, our conscience is bound to the law so
   long as our condition is that of the sinful old man. But when the old
   man is killed by the spirit, then the conscience is free, and
   conscience and law are quit of each other. Not that conscience should
   now do nothing; rather, it should now for the first time truly cling to
   its second husband, Christ, and bring forth the fruit of life.

   Next St. Paul sketches further the nature of sin and the law. It is the
   law that makes sin really active and powerful, because the old man gets
   more and more hostile to the law since he can't pay the debt demanded
   by the law. Sin is his very nature; of himself he can't do otherwise.
   And so the law is his death and torture. Now the law is not itself
   evil; it is our evil nature that cannot tolerate that the good law
   should demand good from it. It's like the case of a sick person, who
   cannot tolerate that you demand that he run and jump around and do
   other things that a healthy person does.

   St. Paul concludes here that, if we understand the law properly and
   comprehend it in the best possible way, then we will see that its sole
   function is to remind us of our sins, to kill us by our sins, and to
   make us deserving of eternal wrath. Conscience learns and experiences
   all this in detail when it comes face to face with the law. It follows,
   then, that we must have something else, over and above the law, which
   can make a person virtuous and cause him to be saved. Those, however,
   who do not understand the law rightly are blind; they go their way
   boldly and think they are satisfying the law with works. They don't
   know how much the law demands, namely, a free, willing, eager heart.
   That is the reason that they don't see Moses rightly before their eyes.
   [In both Jewish and Christian teaching, Moses was commonly held to be
   the author of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the bible. Cf.
   the involved imagery of Moses' face and the veil over it in 2
   Corinthians 3:7-18.] For them he is covered and concealed by the veil.

   Then St. Paul shows how spirit and flesh struggle with each other in
   one person. He gives himself as an example, so that we may learn how to
   kill sin in ourselves. He gives both spirit and flesh the name "law,"
   so that, just as it is in the nature of divine law to drive a person on
   and make demands of him, so too the flesh drives and demands and rages
   against the spirit and wants to have its own way. Likewise the spirit
   drives and demands against the flesh and wants to have its own way.
   This feud lasts in us for as long as we live, in one person more, in
   another less, depending on whether spirit or flesh is stronger. Yet the
   whole human being is both: spirit and flesh. The human being fights
   with himself until he becomes completely spiritual.

   In chapter 8, St. Paul comforts fighters such as these and tells them
   that this flesh will not bring them condemnation. He goes on to show
   what the nature of flesh and spirit are. Spirit, he says, comes from
   Christ, who has given us his Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit makes us
   spiritual and restrains the flesh. The Holy Spirit assures us that we
   are God's children no matter how furiously sin may rage within us, so
   long as we follow the Spirit and struggle against sin in order to kill
   it. Because nothing is so effective in deadening the flesh as the cross
   and suffering, Paul comforts us in our suffering. He says that the
   Spirit, [cf. previous note about the meaning of "spirit."] love and all
   creatures will stand by us; the Spirit in us groans and all creatures
   long with us that we be freed from the flesh and from sin. Thus we see
   that these three chapters, 6, 7 and 8, all deal with the one work of
   faith, which is to kill the old Adam and to constrain the flesh.

   In chapters 9, 10 and 11, St. Paul teaches us about the eternal
   providence of God. It is the original source which determines who would
   believe and who wouldn't, who can be set free from sin and who cannot.
   Such matters have been taken out of our hands and are put into God's
   hands so that we might become virtuous. It is absolutely necessary that
   it be so, for we are so weak and unsure of ourselves that, if it
   depended on us, no human being would be saved. The devil would
   overpower all of us. But God is steadfast; his providence will not
   fail, and no one can prevent its realization. Therefore we have hope
   against sin.

   But here we must shut the mouths of those sacriligeous and arrogant
   spirits who, mere beginners that they are, bring their reason to bear
   on this matter and commence, from their exalted position, to probe the
   abyss of divine providence and uselessly trouble themselves about
   whether they are predestined or not. These people must surely plunge to
   their ruin, since they will either despair or abandon themselves to a
   life of chance.

   You, however, follow the reasoning of this letter in the order in which
   it is presented. Fix your attention first of all on Christ and the
   Gospel, so that you may recognize your sin and his grace. Then struggle
   against sin, as chapters 1-8 have taught you to. Finally, when you have
   come, in chapter 8, under the shadow of the cross and suffering, they
   will teach you, in chapters 9-11, about providence and what a comfort
   it is. [The context here and in St. Paul's letter makes it clear that
   this is the cross and passion, not only of Christ, but of each
   Christian.] Apart from suffering, the cross and the pangs of death, you
   cannot come to grips with providence without harm to yourself and
   secret anger against God. The old Adam must be quite dead before you
   can endure this matter and drink this strong wine. Therefore make sure
   you don't drink wine while you are still a babe at the breast. There is
   a proper measure, time and age for understanding every doctrine.

   In chapter 12, St. Paul teaches the true liturgy and makes all
   Christians priests, so that they may offer, not money or cattle, as
   priests do in the Law, but their own bodies, by putting their desires
   to death. Next he describes the outward conduct of Christians whose
   lives are governed by the Spirit; he tells how they teach, preach,
   rule, serve, give, suffer, love, live and act toward friend, foe and
   everyone. These are the works that a Christian does, for, as I have
   said, faith is not idle.

   In chapter 13, St. Paul teaches that one should honor and obey the
   secular authorities. He includes this, not because it makes people
   virtuous in the sight of God, but because it does insure that the
   virtuous have outward peace and protection and that the wicked cannot
   do evil without fear and in undisturbed peace. Therefore it is the duty
   of virtuous people to honor secular authority, even though they do not,
   strictly speaking, need it. Finally, St. Paul sums up everything in
   love and gathers it all into the example of Christ: what he has done
   for us, we must also do and follow after him.

   In chapter 14, St. Paul teaches that one should carefully guide those
   with weak conscience and spare them. One shouldn't use Christian
   freedom to harm but rather to help the weak. Where that isn't done,
   there follow dissention and despising of the Gospel, on which
   everything else depends. It is better to give way a little to the weak
   in faith until they become stronger than to have the teaching of the
   Gospel perish completely. This work is a particularly necessary work of
   love especially now when people, by eating meat and by other freedoms,
   are brashly, boldly and unnecessarily shaking weak consciences which
   have not yet come to know the truth.

   In chapter 15, St. Paul cites Christ as an example to show that we must
   also have patience with the weak, even those who fail by sinning
   publicly or by their disgusting morals. We must not cast them aside but
   must bear with them until they become better. That is the way Christ
   treated us and still treats us every day; he puts up with our vices,
   our wicked morals and all our imperfection, and he helps us
   ceaselessly. Finally Paul prays for the Christians at Rome; he praises
   them and commends them to God. He points out his own office and the
   message that he preaches. He makes an unobtrusive plea for a
   contribution for the poor in Jerusalem. Unalloyed love is the basis of
   all he says and does.

   The last chapter consists of greetings. But Paul also includes a
   salutary warning against human doctrines which are preached alongside
   the Gospel and which do a great deal of harm. It's as though he had
   clearly seen that out of Rome and through the Romans would come the
   deceitful, harmful Canons and Decretals along with the entire brood and
   swarm of human laws and commands that is now drowning the whole world
   and has blotted out this letter and the whole of the Scriptures, along
   with the Spirit and faith. Nothing remains but the idol Belly, and St.
   Paul depicts those people here as its servants. God deliver us from
   them. Amen.

   We find in this letter, then, the richest possible teaching about what
   a Christian should know: the meaning of law, Gospel, sin, punishment,
   grace, faith, justice, Christ, God, good works, love, hope and the
   cross. We learn how we are to act toward everyone, toward the virtuous
   and sinful, toward the strong and the weak, friend and foe, and toward
   ourselves. Paul bases everything firmly on Scripture and proves his
   points with examples from his own experience and from the Prophets, so
   that nothing more could be desired. Therefore it seems that St. Paul,
   in writing this letter, wanted to compose a summary of the whole of
   Christian and evangelical teaching which would also be an introduction
   to the whole Old Testament. Without doubt, whoever takes this letter to
   heart possesses the light and power of the Old Testament. Therefore
   each and every Christian should make this letter the habitual and
   constant object of his study. God grant us his grace to do so. Amen.
