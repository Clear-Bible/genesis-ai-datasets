   1. Lord's Day

   Question 1.
   What is thy only comfort in life and death?
   Answer.
   That I with body and soul, both in life and death, (a)
   am not my own, (b)
   but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; (c)
   who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, (d)
   and delivered me from all the power of the devil; (e)
   and so preserves me (f)
   that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from
   my head; (g)
   yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, (h)
   and therefore, by his Holy Spirit,
   He also assures me of eternal life, (i)

   this comfort, mayest live and die happily?
   Answer.
   Three; (a)
   the first, how great my sins and miseries are; (b)

   Lord: walk as children of light:

   righteousness and truth;)

   people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
   mercy.
   Rom. 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
   may abound?
   Rom. 6:2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
   longer therein?
   Rom. 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
   should obey it in the lusts thereof.
   Rom. 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
   unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that

The First Part - Of The Misery Of Man

   2. Lord's Day

   Question 3.
   Whence knowest thou thy misery?
   Answer.
   Out of the law of God. (a)

   (a)
   Rom. 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
   justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

   Question 4.
   What does the law of God require of us?
   Answer.
   Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40,
   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
   soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
   This is the first and the great commandment; and the second is like
   unto it,
   Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
   On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." (a)

   (a)
   Deut. 6:5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart,
   and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
   Lev. 19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
   children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:
   I am the LORD.
   Mark 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:
   this is the first commandment.
   Luke 10:27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
   all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and
   with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

   Question 5.
   Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?
   Answer.
   In no wise; (a)
   for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour.(b)

   (a)
   Rom. 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
   Rom. 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
   justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
   Rom. 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
   1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
   truth is not in us.
   1 John 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and
   his word is not in us.
   (b)
   Rom. 8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
   subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
   Eph. 2:3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
   the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
   mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
   Tit. 3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
   deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
   envy, hateful, and hating one another.
   Gen. 6:5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
   and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually.
   Gen. 8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
   heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for
   the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I
   again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
   Jer. 17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
   wicked: who can know it?
   Rom. 7:23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
   of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is
   in my members.

   3. Lord's Day

   Question 6.
   Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?
   Answer.
   By no means; but God created man good, (a)
   and after his own image, (b)
   in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his
   Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to
   glorify and praise him. (c)

   (a)
   Gen. 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
   very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
   (b)
   Gen. 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
   likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
   the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
   over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
   Gen. 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
   created he him; male and female created he them.
   (c)
   Col. 3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
   man with his deeds;
   Col. 3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
   after the image of him that created him:
   Eph. 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
   Eph. 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.
   2 Cor. 3:18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
   glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
   even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

   Question 7.
   Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?
   Answer.
   From the fall and disobedience of our first parents,
   Adam and Eve, in Paradise; (a)
   hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all conceived and
   born in sin. (b)

   (a)
   Genesis 3.
   Rom. 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
   sinned:
   Rom. 5:18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
   to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
   upon all men unto justification of life.
   Rom. 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
   by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
   (b)
   Ps. 51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
   conceive me.
   Gen. 5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
   his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:

   Question 8.
   Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good,
   and inclined to all wickedness?
   Answer.
   Indeed we are; (a)
   except we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. (b)

   (a)
   Gen. 8:21 The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;
   John 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
   born of the Spirit is spirit.
   Gen. 6:5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
   and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually.
   Job 14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
   Job 15:14 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
   a woman, that he should be righteous?
   Job 15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
   iniquity like water?
   Job 15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
   belly prepareth deceit.
   Isa. 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
   to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
   (b)
   John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
   thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
   John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
   be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
   God.
   1 Cor. 12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
   the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that
   Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
   2 Cor. 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing
   as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

   4. Lord's Day

   Question 9.
   Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his
   law, that which he cannot perform?
   Answer.
   Not at all; (a)
   for God made man capable of performing it;
   but man, by the instigation of the devil, (b)
   and his own wilful disobedience, (c)
   deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.

   (a)
   Eph. 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.
   Eccl. 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
   but they have sought out many inventions.
   (b)
   John 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
   ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
   truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he
   speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
   2 Cor. 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
   through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
   simplicity that is in Christ.
   Gen. 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
   (c)
   Gen. 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
   that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
   wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
   her husband with her; and he did eat.
   Rom. 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
   sinned:
   Gen. 3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
   hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
   1 Tim. 2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
   1 Tim. 2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was
   in the transgression.

   Question 10.
   Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?
   Answer.
   By no means; but is terribly displeased (a)
   with our original as well as actual sins;
   and will punish them in his just judgment temporally and eternally, (b)
   as he has declared,
   "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are
   written in the book of the law, to do them." (c)

   (a)
   Gen. 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
   not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
   surely die.
   Rom. 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
   sinned:
   (b)
   Ps. 5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
   workers of iniquity.
   Ps. 50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
   thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will
   reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
   Nah. 1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
   and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he
   reserveth wrath for his enemies.
   Exod. 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for
   I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
   fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
   that hate me;
   Exod. 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
   transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty;
   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the
   children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
   Rom. 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
   unrighteousness;
   Eph. 5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
   things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
   Heb. 9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
   the judgment:
   (c)
   Deut. 27:26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law
   to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
   Gal. 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
   curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

   Question 11.
   Is not God then also merciful?
   Answer.
   God is indeed merciful, (a) but also just; (b) therefore his justice
   requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of
   God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting
   punishment of body and soul.

   (a)
   Exod. 34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
   The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in
   goodness and truth,
   Exod. 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
   transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty;
   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the
   children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
   Exod. 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
   keep my commandments.
   (b)
   Ps. 7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
   establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
   Exod. 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for
   I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
   fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
   that hate me;
   Exod. 23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
   righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
   Exod. 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
   transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty;
   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the
   children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
   Ps. 5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
   workers of iniquity.
   Ps. 5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor
   the bloody and deceitful man.
   Nah. 1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
   and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he
   reserveth wrath for his enemies.
   Nah. 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
   all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in
   the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

The Second Part - Of Man's Deliverance

   5. Lord's Day

   Question 12.
   Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and
   eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that
   punishment, and be again received into favour?
   Answer.
   God will have his justice satisfied: (a)
   and therefore we must make this full satisfaction, either by ourselves,
   or by another. (b)

   (a)
   Gen. 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
   not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
   surely die.
   Exod. 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for
   I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
   fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
   that hate me;
   Exod. 23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
   righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
   Ezek. 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so
   also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
   Matt. 5:26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
   thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
   2 Thess. 1:6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
   tribulation to them that trouble you;
   Luke 16:2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
   this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no
   longer steward.
   (b)
   Rom. 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
   Rom. 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   Question 13.
   Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?
   Answer.
   By no means; but on the contrary we daily increase our debt. (a)

   (a)

   God?

   world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for
   his soul?

   Question 14.
   Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to
   satisfy for us?
   Answer.
   None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin
   which man has committed; (a) and further, no mere creature can sustain
   the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others
   from it. (b)

   (a)
   Ezek. 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so

   sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

   fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the
   rocks are thrown down by him.
   Ps. 130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
   stand?

   Question 15.
   What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?
   Answer.
   For one who is very man, and perfectly (a) righteous; (b) and yet more
   powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God. (c)

   (a)

   after the power of an endless life.

   virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
   Immanuel.

   6. Lord's day

   Question 16. Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?
   Answer.
   Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which
   has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; (a)
   and one, who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others. (b)

   (a)
   Ezek. 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so
   also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
   Ezek. 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
   the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity
   of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and
   the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
   Rom. 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
   sinned:
   Rom. 5:15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
   through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
   and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
   unto many.
   Rom. 5:18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
   to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
   upon all men unto justification of life.

   Heb. 2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage.
   Heb. 2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
   took on him the seed of Abraham.

   flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

   acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
   despised, and we esteemed him not.

   we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

   our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
   his stripes we are healed.
   Isa. 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
   grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see
   his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall
   prosper in his hand.
   Isa. 53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
   satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;
   for he shall bear their iniquities.
   (b)

   undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
   Heb. 7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
   sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this
   he did once, when he offered up himself.
   Ps. 49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
   God a ransom for him:
   Ps. 49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
   for ever:)
   1 Pet. 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for
   the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
   flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

   Question 17.
   Why must he in one person be also very God?
   Answer.
   That he might, by the power of his Godhead (a)
   sustain in his human nature, (b)
   the burden of God's wrath; (c)
   and might obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life. (d)

   (a)

   will stain all my raiment.

   satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;

   Acts 2:24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
   because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.

   wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of
   the root and fatness of the olive tree;
   Rom. 11:19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I
   might be graffed in.
   Rom. 11:20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
   standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
   Rom. 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
   Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
   difference:
   Heb. 4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
   the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in
   them that heard it.
   Heb. 4:3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said,
   Answer.
   I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although
   the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
   Heb. 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
   salvation unto all them that obey him;
   Heb. 10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
   them that believe to the saving of the soul.
   Heb. 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
   cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
   them that diligently seek him.

   Question 21.
   What is true faith?
   Answer.
   True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth
   all that God has revealed to us in his word, (a)
   but also an assured confidence, (b)
   which the Holy Ghost (c)
   works by the gospel in my heart; (d)
   that not only to others, but to me also,
   remission of sin, everlasting righteousness and salvation, (e)
   are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's
   merits. (f)

   (a)
   James 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
   devils also believe, and tremble.
   (b)
   2 Cor. 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
   written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and
   therefore speak;
   Eph. 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
   his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   Eph. 2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
   Eph. 3:12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
   faith of him.
   Gal. 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
   but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
   Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
   the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
   justified.
   Heb. 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
   of things not seen.
   Heb. 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
   moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
   which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
   which is by faith.
   Heb. 11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
   which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went
   out, not knowing whither he went.
   Heb. 11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
   country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
   him of the same promise:
   Heb. 11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
   builder and maker is God.
   Heb. 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
   we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
   James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
   wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

   Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
   my Father which is in heaven.
   Philip. 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through
   your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
   Rom. 4:17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many
   nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
   dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
   Rom. 4:21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
   able also to perform.
   Rom. 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ:
   Rom. 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
   power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
   first, and also to the Greek.
   Rom. 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and
   with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
   Rom. 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
   God.
   Rom. 4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
   end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which
   is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who
   is the father of us all,
   Rom. 4:18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
   father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall
   thy seed be.
   Rom. 4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
   now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
   deadness of Sara's womb:
   Rom. 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
   was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
   Rom. 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus:
   Rom. 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
   are past, through the forbearance of God;
   (c)
   Gal. 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
   longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   Matt. 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou,
   Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
   my Father which is in heaven.
   2 Cor. 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
   written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and
   therefore speak;
   John 6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
   that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   Philip. 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through
   your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
   Acts 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
   city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord
   opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
   (d)
   Rom. 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
   power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
   first, and also to the Greek.
   Rom. 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
   God.
   1 Cor. 1:21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom
   knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save
   them that believe.
   Acts 10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on
   all them which heard the word.
   Acts 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
   city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord
   opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
   (e)
   Rom. 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith
   to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
   Gal. 3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
   it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
   Heb. 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
   the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
   Heb. 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back,
   my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
   Gal. 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
   but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
   Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
   the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
   justified.
   (f)
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   Rom. 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus:
   Rom. 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
   by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
   Luke 1:77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
   remission of their sins,
   Luke 1:78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
   from on high hath visited us,

   Question 22.
   What is then necessary for a christian to believe?
   Answer.
   All things promised us in the gospel, (a) which the articles of our
   catholic undoubted christian faith briefly teach us.

   (a)
   John 20:31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is
   the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
   through his name.
   Matt. 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
   Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
   at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

   Question 23.
   What are these articles?
   Answer.
   1. I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:
   2. And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord:
   3. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:
   4. Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead, and buried: He
   descended into hell:
   5. The third day he rose again from the dead:
   6. He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the
   Father Almighty:
   7. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:
   8. I believe in the Holy Ghost:
   9. I believe a holy catholic church: the communion of saints:
   10. The forgiveness of sins:
   11. The resurrection of the body:

   8. Lord's Day

   Question 24.
   How are these articles divided?
   Answer.
   Into three parts; the first is of God the Father, and our creation;
   the second of God the Son, and our redemption;
   the third of God the Holy Ghost, and our sanctification.

   Question 25.
   Since there is but one only divine essence, (a)
   why speakest thou of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?
   Answer.
   Because God has so revealed himself in his word, (b)
   that these three distinct persons are the one only true and eternal
   God.

   (a)

   What believest thou when thou sayest,
   "I believe in God the Father,
   Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth"?
   Answer.

   (who of nothing made heaven and earth, with all that is in them; (a)
   who likewise upholds and governs the same by his eternal counsel and
   providence) (b)
   is for the sake of Christ his Son, my God and my Father; (c)
   on whom I rely so entirely, that I have no doubt, but he will provide
   me with all things necessary for soul and body (d)
   and further, that he will make whatever evils he sends upon me, in this
   valley of tears turn out to my advantage; (e)
   for he is able to do it, being Almighty God, (f)
   and willing, being a faithful Father. (g)

   (a)
   Genesis 1 and 2.

   them. Are ye not much better than they?
   Matt. 6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
   stature?
   Matt. 6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of

   was not arrayed like one of these.
   Matt. 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
   day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more

   shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is
   the evil thereof.
   Matt. 7:9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
   he give him a stone?
   Matt. 7:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

   LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and

   as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He
   made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He
   had no understanding?
   Ezek. 8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the

   hath forsaken the earth.

   What advantage is it to us to know that God has created, and by his
   providence does still uphold all things?
   Answer.
   That we may be patient in adversity; (a) thankful in prosperity; (b)
   and that in all things, which may hereafter befall us, we place our
   firm trust in our faithful God and Father, (c)
   that nothing shall separate us from his love; (d)
   since all creatures are so in his hand, that without his will they
   cannot so much as move. (e)

   (a)

   nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
   Rom. 8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord.
   (e)
   Job 1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in

   Of God The Son

   11. Lord's Day

   Question 29.
   Why is the Son of God called "Jesus", that is a Saviour?
   Answer.
   Because he saveth us, and delivereth us from our sins; (a) and
   likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in
   any other. (b)

   (a)
   Matt. 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his
   name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
   Heb. 7:24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an
   unchangeable priesthood.

   other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

   itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in

   and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can

   1 John 5:11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
   life, and this life is in his Son.

   Question 30.
   Do such then believe in Jesus the only Saviour, who seek their
   salvation and welfare of saints, of themselves, or anywhere else?
   Answer.
   They do not; for though they boast of him in words, yet in deeds they
   deny
   Jesus the only deliverer and Saviour; (a)
   for one of these two things must be true, that either Jesus is not a
   complete Saviour; or that they, who by a true faith receive this
   Saviour, must find all things in him necessary to their salvation. (b)

   (a)
   1 Cor. 1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
   baptized in the name of Paul?

   to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
   things in earth, or things in heaven.
   Col. 2:10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all

   cleanseth us from all sin.

   12. Lord's Day

   Question 31.

   Ghost, (a)
   to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, (b)
   who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God

   and to be our only High Priest, (d)
   who by the one sacrifice of his body, has redeemed us, (e)

   Luke 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed

   (b)

   midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall
   hearken;

   sanctified.

   hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now
   to appear in the presence of God for us:

   them before our God day and night.
   Rev. 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
   word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

   Question 32.
   But why art thou called a Christian? (a)
   Answer.
   Because I am a member of Christ by faith, (b)
   and thus am partaker of his anointing; (c)
   that so I may confess his name, (d)
   and present myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to him: (e)
   and also that with a free and good conscience I may fight against sin
   and Satan in this life (f)
   and afterwards I reign with him eternally, over all creatures. (g)

   (a)
   Acts 11:26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And

   church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called
   Christians first in Antioch.
   (b)

   hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

   shall dream dreams:
   (d)

   1 Pet. 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
   nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him

   saints.

   (f)
   1 Pet. 2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
   abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
   Rom. 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
   should obey it in the lusts thereof.
   Rom. 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
   unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
   are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
   righteousness unto God.
   Gal. 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
   the lust of the flesh.

   against the wiles of the devil.
   1 Tim. 1:18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to
   the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest
   war a good warfare;
   1 Tim. 1:19 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
   away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
   (g)
   2 Tim. 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him,
   he also will deny us:
   Matt. 25:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
   all these things be fulfilled.

   13. Lord's Day

   Question 33.
   Why is Christ called the "only begotten Son" of God, since we are also
   the children of God?
   Answer.
   Because Christ alone is the eternal and natural Son of God; (a) but we
   are children adopted of God, by grace, for his sake. (b)

   (a)
   John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
   the Word was God.
   John 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.
   John 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
   made that was made.
   John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
   beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
   full of grace and truth.
   John 1:18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,
   which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
   Heb. 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
   past unto the fathers by the prophets,
   Heb. 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
   hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
   John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life.
   1 John 4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because
   that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through him.
   Rom. 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
   all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
   (b)
   Rom. 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
   but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
   Father.
   Rom. 8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
   are the children of God:
   Rom. 8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
   with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also
   glorified together.
   John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
   the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
   Gal. 4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
   Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
   Eph. 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
   Eph. 1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
   us accepted in the beloved.

   Question 34.
   Wherefore callest thou him "our Lord"?
   Answer.
   Because he hath redeemed us, both soul and body, from all our sins, not
   with silver or gold, but with his precious blood, and has delivered us
   from all the power of the devil; and thus has made us his own property.
   (a)

   (a)
   1 Pet. 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers;
   1 Pet. 1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot:
   1 Pet. 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
   nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him
   who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
   1 Cor. 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in
   your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
   1 Cor. 7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
   1 Tim. 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
   time.

   14. Lord's Day
   Question 35.
   What is the meaning of these words
   "He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary"?
   Answer.
   That God's eternal Son, who is, and continues (a)
   true and eternal God, (b)
   took upon him the very nature of man, of the flesh and blood of the
   virgin Mary, (c)
   by the operation of the Holy Ghost; (d)
   that he might also be the true seed of David, (e)
   like unto his brethren in all things, (f)
   sin excepted. (g)

   (a)
   Rom. 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
   spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
   Rom. 9:5 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh
   Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
   (b)
   1 John 5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us
   an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
   that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and
   eternal life.
   John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
   the Word was God.

   true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
   Rom. 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
   the seed of David according to the flesh;
   Col. 1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
   creature:
   (c)
   Gal. 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
   Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
   Luke 1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
   a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
   Luke 1:42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
   thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

   come to me?
   (d)
   John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
   beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
   full of grace and truth.
   Matt. 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
   mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
   found with child of the Holy Ghost.
   Matt. 1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
   the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
   David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is
   conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
   Luke 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost
   shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
   thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall
   be called the Son of God.
   (e)
   Ps. 132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn
   from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
   Rom. 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
   the seed of David according to the flesh;
   2 Sam.7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with
   thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out
   of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
   Luke 1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the
   Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
   David:
   Acts 2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn
   with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the
   flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
   (f)
   Philip. 2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the
   form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
   Heb. 2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
   death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil;
   Heb. 2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
   his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
   things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
   people.
   (g)
   Heb. 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
   the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as
   we are, yet without sin.

   Question 36.
   What profit dost thou receive by Christ's holy conception and nativity?
   Answer.
   That he is our Mediator; (a) and with His innocence and perfect
   holiness, covers in the sight of God, my sins, wherein I was conceived
   and brought forth. (b)

   (a)
   Heb. 7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
   undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
   Heb. 7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
   sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this
   he did once, when he offered up himself.
   Heb. 2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
   his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
   things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
   people.
   (b)
   1 Pet. 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers;
   1 Pet. 1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot:
   1 Pet. 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for
   the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
   flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
   1 Cor. 1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
   us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
   1 Cor. 1:31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
   glory in the Lord.
   Rom. 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for

   Question 37.
   What dost thou understand by the words, "He suffered"?
   Answer.
   That he, all the time that he lived on earth, but especially at the end
   of his life, sustained in body and soul, the wrath of God against the
   sins of all mankind: (a)

   he might redeem our body and soul from everlasting damnation, (c)
   and obtain for us the favour of God, righteousness and eternal life.
   (d)

   1 Tim. 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
   time.
   (b)
   Isa. 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to

   prosper in his hand.
   Isa. 53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he

   only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
   1 John 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved

   blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
   redemption for us.
   1 Pet. 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation

   Heb. 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
   holiest by the blood of Jesus,

   Question 38.
   Why did he suffer "under Pontius Pilate, as judge"?
   Answer.
   That he, being innocent, and yet condemned by a temporal judge, (a)
   might thereby free us from the severe judgement of God to which we were
   exposed. (b)

   (a)

   accuse him:
   Luke 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
   worthy of death is done unto him.

   Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault
   in him.
   (b)

   Question 39.
   Is there anything more in his being "crucified", than if he had died
   some other death?
   Answer.
   Yes there is; for thereby I am assured, that he took on him the curse
   which lay upon me; (a)
   for the death of the cross was accursed of God. (b)

   (a)

   shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed

   thee for an inheritance.

   16. Lord's Day

   Question 40.
   Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even "unto death"?
   Answer.
   Because with respect to the justice and truth of God, (a)
   satisfaction for our sins could be made no otherwise, than by the death
   of the Son of God. (b)

   (a)
   Gen. 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
   not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
   surely die.
   (b)
   Rom. 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
   Rom. 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
   Heb. 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
   for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by
   the grace of God should taste death for every man.
   Heb. 2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
   death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil;
   Heb. 2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage.

   Question 41.
   Why was he also "buried"?
   Answer.
   Thereby to prove that he was really dead. (a)

   (a)
   Matt. 27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a
   clean linen cloth,
   Matt. 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in

   departed.

   John 19:38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of
   Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might
   take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came
   therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

   preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
   Acts 13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him,
   they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

   Question 42.
   Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?
   Answer.
   Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, (a)
   but only an abolishing of sin, and a passage into eternal life. (b)

   (a)
   Mark 8:37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
   Ps. 49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
   God a ransom for him:
   (b)

   believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
   come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

   depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:

   of this death?

   Question 43.
   What further benefit do we receive from the sacrifice and death of
   Christ on the cross?
   Answer.
   That by virtue thereof, our old man is crucified, dead and buried with
   him; (a)
   that so the corrupt inclinations of the flesh may no more reign in us;
   (b)
   but that we may offer ourselves unto him a sacrifice of thanksgiving.
   (c)

   (a)
   Rom. 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
   body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
   sin.
   (b)
   Rom. 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
   body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
   sin.
   Rom. 6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.
   Rom. 6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
   live with him:
   Rom. 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
   sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
   Rom. 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
   should obey it in the lusts thereof.
   Col. 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
   him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from
   the dead.
   (c)

   that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
   God, which is your reasonable service.

   Question 44.
   Why is there added, "he descended into hell"?
   Answer.
   That in my greatest temptations, I may be assured, and wholly comfort
   myself in this, that my Lord Jesus Christ, by his inexpressible
   anguish, pains, terrors, and hellish agonies, in which he was plunged
   during all his sufferings, (a)
   but especially on the cross, has delivered me from the anguish and
   torments of hell. (b)

   (a)

   grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see
   his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall
   prosper in his hand.
   Matt. 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,

   hast thou forsaken me?

   Isa. 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
   our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
   his stripes we are healed.

   17. Lord's Day

   Question 45.
   What does the "resurrection" of Christ profit us?
   Answer.
   First, by his resurrection he has overcome death, that he might make us
   partakers of that righteousness which he had purchased for us by his
   death; (a)
   secondly, we are also by his power raised up to a new life; (b)
   and lastly, the resurrection of Christ is a sure pledge of our blessed
   resurrection. (c)

   our justification.

   which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a

   say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
   1 Cor. 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the

   resurrection of the dead.

   Question 46.
   How dost thou understand these words, "he ascended into heaven"?
   Answer.
   That Christ, in sight of his disciples, was taken up from earth into
   heaven; (a)
   and that he continues there for our interest, (b)
   until he comes again to judge the quick and the dead. (c)

   Question 47.
   Is not Christ then with us even to the end of the world,
   as he has promised? (a)
   Answer.
   Christ is very man and very God;

   Question 48.
   But if his human nature is not present,
   wherever his Godhead is,
   are not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?
   Answer.
   Not as all,
   for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent, (a)
   it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the
   human nature he assumed, (b)
   and yet is nevertheless in this human nature,
   and remains personally united to it.

   place where the Lord lay.

   Question 49.
   Of what advantage to us is Christ's ascension into heaven?
   Answer.
   First, that he is our advocate in the presence of his Father in heaven;
   (a)
   secondly, that we have our flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that he,
   as the head,
   will also take up to himself,
   us, his members; (b)
   thirdly, that he sends us his Spirit as an earnest, (c)

   and not things on earth." (d)

   equal with God:
   Philip. 2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the
   form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
   Philip. 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
   and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

   Question 56.
   What believest thou concerning "the forgiveness of sins"?

   of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is
   in my members.

   of this death?

   mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
   (c)
   Rom. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in

   free from the law of sin and death.
   Rom. 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for

   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the

   mortal must put on immortality.

   neither has it entered into the heart of man" to conceive,
   and that to praise God therein for ever. (b)

   (a)

   Only by a true faith in Jesus Christ; (a)
   so that,
   though my conscience accuse me,
   that I have grossly transgressed all the commandments of God,
   and kept none of them, (b)
   and am still inclined to all evil; (c)
   notwithstanding, God,
   without any merit of mine, (d)
   but only of mere grace, (e)
   grants and imputes to me, (f)
   the perfect satisfaction, (g)
   righteousness and holiness of Christ; (h)
   even so, as if I never had had, nor committed any sin:
   yea, as if I had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ has
   accomplished for me; (i)
   inasmuch as I embrace such benefit with a believing heart. (j)

   (a)
   Rom. 3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is
   manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
   Rom. 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
   Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
   difference:
   Rom. 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
   Rom. 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus:
   Rom. 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
   are past, through the forbearance of God;
   Rom. 3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
   without the deeds of the law.
   Rom. 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ:
   Rom. 5:2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
   we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
   Gal. 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
   but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
   Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
   the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
   justified.
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   Eph. 2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
   Philip. 3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness,
   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
   the righteousness which is of God by faith:
   (b)
   Rom. 3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
   have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
   (c)
   Rom. 7:23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
   of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is
   in my members.
   (d)
   Tit. 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
   Deut. 9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
   this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
   stiffnecked people.
   Ezek. 36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
   GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy
   name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
   (e)
   Rom. 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus:
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   (f)
   Rom. 4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
   but of debt.
   Rom. 4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
   justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
   2 Cor. 5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
   himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
   unto us the word of reconciliation.
   (g)
   1 John 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
   only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
   (h)
   1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye
   sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
   Jesus Christ the righteous:
   (i)
   2 Cor. 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
   (j)
   Rom. 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
   Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
   difference:
   John 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
   believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
   name of the only begotten Son of God.

   Question 61.
   Why sayest thou,
   that thou art righteous by faith only?
   Answer.
   Not that I am acceptable to God,
   on account of the worthiness of my faith;
   but because only the satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of
   Christ,
   is my righteousness before God; (a)
   and that I cannot receive and apply the same to myself any other way
   than by faith only. (b)

   (a)
   1 Cor. 1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
   us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
   1 Cor. 2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
   Christ, and him crucified.
   (b)
   1 John 5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
   himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he
   believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

   24. Lord's Day

   Question 62.
   But why cannot our good works be the whole,
   or part of our righteousness before God?
   Answer.
   Because, that the righteousness,
   which can be approved of before the tribunal of God,
   must be absolutely perfect, (a)
   and in all respects conformable to the divine law;
   and also, that our best works in this life are all imperfect and
   defiled with sin. (b)

   (a)
   Gal. 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
   curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
   Deut. 27:26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law
   to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
   (b)
   Isa. 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and
   our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

   Question 63.
   What! do not our good works merit,
   which yet God will reward in this and in a future life?
   Answer.
   This reward is not of merit, but of grace. (a)

   (a)
   Luke 17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things
   which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
   done that which was our duty to do.

   Question 64.
   But does not this doctrine make men careless and profane?
   Answer.
   By no means:
   for it is impossible that those,
   who are implanted into Christ by a true faith,
   should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness. (a)

   (a)
   Matt. 7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
   corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
   John 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
   and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
   do nothing.

   Of The Sacraments

   25. Lord's Day

   Question 65.
   Since then we are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by
   faith only,
   whence does this faith proceed?
   Answer.
   From the Holy Ghost, (a)
   who works faith in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel,
   and confirms it by the use of the sacraments. (b)

   (a)
   Eph. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God:
   Eph. 2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
   Eph. 6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
   Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
   John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
   be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
   God.
   Philip. 1:29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
   to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
   (b)
   Matt. 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
   Matt. 28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
   commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
   world. Amen.
   1 Pet. 1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
   through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye
   love one another with a pure heart fervently:
   1 Pet. 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

   Question 66.
   What are the sacraments?
   Answer.
   The sacraments are holy visible signs and seals,
   appointed of God for this end, that by the use thereof,
   he may the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel,
   viz., that he grants us freely the remission of sin,
   and life eternal,
   for the sake of that one sacrifice of Christ,
   accomplished on the cross. (a)

   (a)
   Gen. 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
   shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
   Rom. 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
   righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that
   he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
   circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
   Deut. 30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
   heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
   with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
   Lev. 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
   the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall
   the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.
   Heb. 9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every
   year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the
   errors of the people:
   Heb. 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
   of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet
   standing:
   Heb. 9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
   offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the
   service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
   Heb. 9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
   hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now
   to appear in the presence of God for us:
   Ezek. 20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between
   me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify
   them.
   Isa. 6:6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
   his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
   Isa. 6:7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
   thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
   Isa. 54:9 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have
   sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have
   I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

   Question 67.
   Are both word and sacraments, then,
   ordained and appointed for this end,
   that they may direct our faith to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the
   cross,
   as the only ground of our salvation? (a)
   Answer.
   Yes, indeed:
   for the Holy Ghost teaches us in the gospel,
   and assures us by the sacraments,
   that the whole of our salvation depends upon that one sacrifice of
   Christ which he offered for us on the cross.

   (a)
   Rom. 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
   Christ were baptized into his death?
   Gal. 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
   on Christ.

   Question 68.
   How many sacraments has Christ instituted in the new covenant, or
   testament?
   Answer.
   Two: namely,
   holy baptism,
   and the holy supper.

   Of Holy Baptism

   26. Lord's Day

   Question 69.
   How art thou admonished and assured by holy baptism,
   that the one sacrifice of Christ upon the cross is of real advantage to
   thee?
   Answer.
   Thus: That Christ appointed this external washing with water, (a)
   adding thereto this promise, (b)
   that I am as certainly washed by his blood and Spirit from all the
   pollution of my soul,
   that is, from all my sins, (c)
   as I am washed externally with water,
   by which the filthiness of the body is commonly washed away.

   (a)
   Matt. 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
   (b)
   Matt. 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
   Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
   of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye
   shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
   Matt. 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
   cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
   bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
   Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he
   that believeth not shall be damned.
   John 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with
   water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
   descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with
   the Holy Ghost.
   Rom. 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
   Christ were baptized into his death?
   Rom. 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
   like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
   even so we also should walk in newness of life.
   (c)
   1 Pet. 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
   us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a
   good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
   Mark 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
   repentance for the remission of sins.
   Luke 3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
   baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

   Question 70.
   What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?
   Answer.
   It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely,
   for the sake of Christ's blood,
   which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross; (a)
   and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost,
   and sanctified to be members of Christ,
   that so we may more and more die unto sin,
   and lead holy and unblamable lives. (b)

   (a)
   Heb. 12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
   blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.
   1 Pet. 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
   through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of
   the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
   Rev. 1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
   first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
   Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
   Rev. 7:14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
   These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
   their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
   Zech. 13:1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
   David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
   Ezek. 36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
   clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
   cleanse you.
   (b)
   John 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with
   water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
   descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with
   the Holy Ghost.
   John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
   be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
   God.
   1 Cor. 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
   sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
   the Spirit of our God.
   1 Cor. 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,
   whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
   been all made to drink into one Spirit.
   Rom. 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
   like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
   even so we also should walk in newness of life.
   Col. 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
   him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from
   the dead.

   Question 71.
   Where has Christ promised us,
   that he will as certainly wash us by his blood and Spirit,
   as we are washed with the water of baptism?
   Answer.
   In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed:
   "Go ye, therefore,
   and teach all nations,
   baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost", Matt. 28:19.
   And
   "he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved;
   but he that believeth not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16.
   This promise is also repeated, where the scripture calls baptism
   "the washing of regenerations" and the washing away of sins. Tit. 3:5,
   Acts 22:16. (a)

   (a)
   Tit. 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
   Acts 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
   away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

   27. Lord's Day

   Question 72.
   Is then the external baptism with water the washing away of sin itself?
   Answer.
   Not at all: (a)
   for the blood of Jesus Christ only,
   and the Holy Ghost cleanse us from all sin. (b)

   (a)
   Matt. 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
   cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
   bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
   1 Pet. 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
   us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a
   good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
   Eph. 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
   water by the word,
   Eph. 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
   having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy
   and without blemish.
   (b)
   1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth us from all sin.
   1 Cor. 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
   sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
   the Spirit of our God.

   Question 73.
   Why then does the Holy Ghost call baptism
   "the washing of regeneration,"
   and "the washing away of sins"?
   Answer.
   God speaks thus not without great cause,
   to-wit, not only thereby to teach us,
   that as the filth of the body is purged away by water,
   so our sins are removed by the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; (a)
   but especially that by this divine pledge and sign he may assure us,
   that we are spiritually cleansed from our sins as really,
   as we are externally washed with water. (b)

   (a)
   Rev. 1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
   first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
   Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
   Rev. 7:14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
   These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
   their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
   1 Cor. 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
   sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
   the Spirit of our God.
   (b)
   Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he
   that believeth not shall be damned.
   Gal. 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
   on Christ.

   Question 74.
   Are infants also to be baptized?
   Answer.
   Yes:
   for since they,
   as well as the adult,
   are included in the covenant and church of God; (a)
   and since redemption from sin (b)
   by the blood of Christ,
   and the Holy Ghost,
   the author of faith,
   is promised to them no less than to the adult; (c)
   they must therefore by baptism,
   as a sign of the covenant,
   be also admitted into the christian church;
   and be distinguished from the children of unbelievers (d)
   as was done in the old covenant or testament by circumcision, (e)
   instead of which baptism is instituted (f)
   in the new covenant.

   (a)
   Gen. 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
   seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be
   a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
   (b)
   Matt. 19:14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them
   not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
   (c)
   Luke 1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
   drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the
   Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
   Ps. 22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
   mother's belly.
   Isa. 44:1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
   chosen:

   womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou,
   Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
   Isa. 44:3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
   upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my
   blessing upon thine offspring:
   Acts 2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
   that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
   (d)
   Acts 10:47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
   which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
   (e)
   Gen. 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin
   is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath
   broken my covenant.
   (f)
   Col. 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
   without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
   circumcision of Christ:
   Col. 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
   him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from
   the dead.
   Col. 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
   your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you
   all trespasses;

   Of The Holy Supper Of Our Lord Jesus Christ

   28 Lord's Day

   Question 75.
   How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper,
   that thou art a partaker of that one sacrifice of Christ,
   accomplished on the cross,
   and of all his benefits?
   Answer.
   Thus: That Christ has commanded me and all believers,
   to eat of this broken bread,
   and to drink of this cup,
   in remembrance of him,
   adding these promises: (a)
   first,
   that his body was offered and broken on the cross for me,
   and his blood shed for me,
   as certainly as I see with my eyes,
   the bread of the Lord broken for me,
   and the cup communicated to me;
   and further,
   that he feeds and nourishes my soul to everlasting life,
   with his crucified body and shed blood,
   as assuredly as I receive from the hands of the minister,
   and taste with my mouth the bread and cup of the Lord,
   as certain signs of the body and blood of Christ.

   (a)
   Matt. 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,
   and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this
   is my body.
   Matt. 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
   saying, Drink ye all of it;
   Matt. 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed
   for many for the remission of sins.
   Mark 14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
   brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
   Mark 14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave
   it to them: and they all drank of it.

   testament, which is shed for many.
   Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
   unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
   remembrance of me.
   Luke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
   new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
   1 Cor. 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
   communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
   the communion of the body of Christ?
   1 Cor. 10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread.
   1 Cor. 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I
   delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
   betrayed took bread:
   1 Cor. 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
   eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance
   of me.
   1 Cor. 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
   supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye,
   as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
   1 Cor. 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,
   whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
   been all made to drink into one Spirit.

   Question 76.
   What is it then to eat the crucified body,
   and drink the shed blood of Christ?
   Answer.
   It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and
   death of Christ and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin,
   and life eternal; (a)
   but also, besides that,
   to become more and more united to his sacred body, (b)
   by the Holy Ghost,
   who dwells both in Christ and in us;
   so that we,
   though Christ is in heaven (c)
   and we on earth,
   are notwithstanding "flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone" (d)
   and that we live, and are governed forever by one spirit, (e)
   as members of the same body are by one soul.

   (a)
   John 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
   cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
   never thirst.
   John 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
   which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life:
   and I will raise him up at the last day.

   everlasting life.

   John 6:50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man
   may eat thereof, and not die.
   John 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
   eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I
   will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
   John 6:52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can
   this man give us his flesh to eat?
   John 6:53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have
   no life in you.
   John 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal
   life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
   (b)
   John 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
   John 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
   me, and I in him.
   (c)
   Col. 3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
   above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
   Acts 3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
   of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
   prophets since the world began.
   1 Cor. 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
   do shew the Lord's death till he come.
   (d)
   Eph. 3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his
   glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
   Eph. 5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
   cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
   Eph. 5:30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
   bones.
   Eph. 5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and
   the church.
   1 Cor. 6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?
   shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of
   an harlot? God forbid.
   1 Cor. 6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
   1 Cor. 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
   Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
   1 John 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and
   he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit
   which he hath given us.
   1 John 4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
   he hath given us of his Spirit.
   John 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
   keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
   and make our abode with him.
   (e)
   John 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
   me, and I in him.
   John 6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
   so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
   John 6:58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
   fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall
   live for ever.
   John 15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
   John 15:2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away:
   and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
   forth more fruit.
   John 15:3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
   you.
   John 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
   itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in
   me.
   John 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
   and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
   do nothing.
   John 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
   is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
   are burned.
   Eph. 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
   things, which is the head, even Christ:
   Eph. 4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
   by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working
   in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the
   edifying of itself in love.

   Question 77.
   Where has Christ promised that he will as certainly feed and nourish
   believers with his body and bleed,
   as they eat of this broken bread, and drink of this cup?
   Answer.
   In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: (a)
   "The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed,
   took bread,
   and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said:
   eat, this is my body, which is broken for you;
   this do in remembrance of me.
   After the same manner also he took the cup,
   when he had supped, saying:
   this cup is the new testament in my blood;
   this do ye, as often as ye drink it,
   in remembrance of me.
   For, as often as ye eat this bread,
   and drink this cup,
   ye do show the Lord's death till he come."
   1 Cor. 11:23-26.
   This promise is repeated by the holy apostle Paul, where he says
   "The cup of blessing which we bless,
   is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
   The bread which we break,
   is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
   For we being many are one bread,
   and one body:
   for we are all partakers of that one bread."
   1 Cor. 10:16,17.

   (a)
   1 Cor. 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I
   delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
   betrayed took bread:
   1 Cor. 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
   eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance
   of me.
   1 Cor. 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
   supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye,
   as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
   Matt. 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,
   and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this
   is my body.
   Matt. 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
   saying, Drink ye all of it;
   Matt. 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed
   for many for the remission of sins.
   Mark 14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
   brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
   Mark 14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave
   it to them: and they all drank of it.
   Mark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new
   testament, which is shed for many.
   Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
   unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
   remembrance of me.
   Luke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
   new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
   1 Cor. 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
   communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
   the communion of the body of Christ?
   1 Cor. 10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread.

   2. Lord's Day

   Question 78.
   Do then the bread and wine become the very body and blood of Christ?
   Answer.
   Not at all: (a)
   but as the water in baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ,
   neither is the washing away of sin itself,
   being only the sign and confirmation thereof appointed of God; (b)
   so the bread in the Lord's supper is not changed into the very body of
   Christ; (c)
   though agreeably to the nature and properties of sacraments, (d)
   it is called the body of Christ Jesus.

   (a)
   Matt. 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this
   fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
   Father's kingdom.
   (b)
   Eph. 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
   water by the word,
   Tit. 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
   (c)
   Mark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new
   testament, which is shed for many.
   1 Cor. 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
   communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
   the communion of the body of Christ?
   1 Cor. 10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread.
   1 Cor. 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
   do shew the Lord's death till he come.
   1 Cor. 11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this
   cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of
   the Lord.
   1 Cor. 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
   bread, and drink of that cup.
   (d)
   Gen. 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
   and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
   circumcised.
   Gen. 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
   shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
   Gen. 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin
   is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath
   broken my covenant.
   Gen. 17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed;
   and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant
   with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
   Exod. 12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your
   shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in
   haste: it is the LORD'S passover.
   Exod. 12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
   where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the
   plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of
   Egypt.
   Exod. 12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S
   passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in
   Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
   people bowed the head and worshipped.
   Exod. 12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the
   ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
   Exod. 12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep
   the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then
   let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in
   the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
   Exod. 13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and
   for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy
   mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
   1 Pet. 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
   us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a
   good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
   1 Cor. 10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
   how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through
   the sea;
   1 Cor. 10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
   sea;
   1 Cor. 10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
   1 Cor. 10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank
   of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

   Question 79.
   Why then doth Christ call the bread "his body",
   and the cup "his blood", or "the new covenant in his blood";
   and Paul the "communion of body and blood of Christ"?
   Answer.
   Christ speaks thus, not without great reason,
   namely, not only thereby to teach us, that as bread and wine support
   this temporal life,
   so his crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and drink,
   whereby our souls are fed to eternal life; (a)
   but more especially by these visible signs and pledges to assure us,
   that we are as really partakers of his true body and blood by the
   operation of the Holy Ghost as we receive by the mouths of our bodies
   these holy signs in remembrance of him; (b)
   and that all his sufferings and obedience are as certainly ours,
   as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction for our
   sins to God.

   (a)
   John 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
   eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I
   will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
   John 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
   (b)
   1 Cor. 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
   communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
   the communion of the body of Christ?
   1 Cor. 10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread.

   30. Lord's Day

   Question 80.
   What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the popish mass?
   Answer.
   The Lord's supper testifies to us,
   that we have a full pardon of all sin by the only sacrifice of Jesus
   Christ,
   which he himself has once accomplished on the cross; (a)
   and, that we by the Holy Ghost are ingrafted into Christ, (b)
   who, according to his human nature is now not on earth, but in heaven,
   at the right hand of God his Father, (c)
   and will there be worshipped by us. (d)
   But the mass teaches,
   that the living and dead have not the pardon of sins through the
   sufferings of Christ,
   unless Christ is also daily offered for them by the priests;
   and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and wine,
   and therefore is to be worshipped in them;
   so that the mass, at bottom,
   is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of
   Jesus Christ,
   and an accursed idolatry. (e)

   (a)
   Heb. 7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
   sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this
   he did once, when he offered up himself.
   Heb. 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
   blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
   redemption for us.
   Heb. 9:25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high
   priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
   Heb. 9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
   the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put
   away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
   Heb. 9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
   the judgment:
   Heb. 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
   them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation.
   Heb. 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
   the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
   Heb. 10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
   for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
   Heb. 10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
   footstool.
   Heb. 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified.
   John 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It
   is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
   Matt. 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed
   for many for the remission of sins.
   Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
   unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
   remembrance of me.
   Luke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
   new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
   (b)
   1 Cor. 6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
   1 Cor. 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
   communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
   the communion of the body of Christ?
   (c)
   Heb. 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
   of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when
   he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
   Majesty on high;
   Heb. 8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We
   have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of
   the Majesty in the heavens;
   Heb. 8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
   the Lord pitched, and not man.
   John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet
   ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
   ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
   (d)
   Matt. 6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
   moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
   steal:
   Matt. 6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
   John 4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,
   when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship
   the Father.
   John 4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
   salvation is of the Jews.
   John 4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
   shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh
   such to worship him.
   John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
   in spirit and in truth.
   Luke 24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with
   great joy:
   Acts 7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
   into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
   hand of God,
   Acts 7:56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of
   man standing on the right hand of God.
   Col. 3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
   above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
   Philip. 3:20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we
   look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
   Philip. 3:21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
   like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
   able even to subdue all things unto himself.
   1 Thess. 1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from
   the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
   Heb. 9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
   always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
   Heb. 9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every
   year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the
   errors of the people:
   Heb. 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
   of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet
   standing:
   Heb. 9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
   offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the
   service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
   Heb. 9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings,
   and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
   (e)
   Heb. 9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
   the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put
   away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
   Heb. 10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
   for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
   Heb. 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified.
   Heb. 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
   holiest by the blood of Jesus,
   Heb. 10:20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
   through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
   Heb. 10:21 And having an high priest over the house of God;
   Heb. 10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
   faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
   bodies washed with pure water.
   Heb. 10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
   wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
   Heb. 10:24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
   good works:
   Heb. 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
   manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as
   ye see the day approaching.
   Heb. 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
   knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
   Heb. 10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
   indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
   Heb. 10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
   three witnesses:
   Heb. 10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
   thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
   counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
   unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
   Heb. 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me,
   I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his
   people.
   Heb. 10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
   God.

   Question 81.
   For whom is the Lord's supper instituted?
   Answer.
   For those who are truly sorrowful for their sins,
   and yet trust that these are forgiven them for the sake of Christ;
   and that their remaining infirmities are covered by his passion and
   death;
   and who also earnestly desire to have their faith more and more
   strengthened,
   and their lives more holy;
   but hypocrites,
   and such as turn not to God with sincere hearts,
   eat and drink judgment to themselves. (a)

   (a)
   1 Cor. 10:19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which
   is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
   1 Cor. 10:20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
   they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
   should have fellowship with devils.
   1 Cor. 10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of
   devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of
   devils.
   1 Cor. 10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than
   he?
   1 Cor. 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
   bread, and drink of that cup.
   1 Cor. 11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
   drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

   Question 82.
   Are they also to be admitted to this supper,
   who, by confession and life,
   declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly?
   Answer.
   No;
   for by this, the covenant of God would be profaned,
   and his wrath kindled against the whole congregation; (a)
   therefore it is the duty of the christian church,
   according to the appointment of Christ and his apostles,
   to exclude such persons,
   by the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
   till they show amendment of life.

   (a)
   1 Cor. 11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is
   not to eat the Lord's supper.
   1 Cor. 11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come
   not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when
   I come.
   Isa. 1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
   saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat
   of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs,
   or of he goats.
   Isa. 1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
   your hand, to tread my courts?
   Isa. 1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
   me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot
   away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
   Isa. 1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
   are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
   Isa. 1:15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
   from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands
   are full of blood.
   Isa. 66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that
   sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an
   oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as
   if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their
   soul delighteth in their abominations.
   Jer. 7:21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your
   burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
   Jer. 7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
   day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
   offerings or sacrifices:
   Jer. 7:23 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I
   will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the
   ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
   Ps. 50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
   declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
   mouth?

   31. Lord's Day

   Question 83.
   What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?
   Answer.
   The preaching of the holy gospel,
   and christian discipline,
   or excommunication out of the christian church;
   by these two,
   the kingdom of heaven is opened to believers,
   and shut against unbelievers.

   Question 84.
   How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of the
   holy gospel?
   Answer.
   Thus: when according to the command of Christ,
   it is declared and publicly testified to all and every believer,
   that,
   whenever they receive the promise of the gospel by a true faith,
   all their sins are really forgiven them of God,
   for the sake of Christ's merits;
   and on the contrary,
   when it is declared and testified to all unbelievers, and such as do
   not sincerely repent,
   that they stand exposed to the wrath of God,
   and eternal condemnation,
   so long as they are unconverted: (a)
   according to which testimony of the gospel, God will judge them,
   both in this, and in the life to come.

   (a)
   Matt. 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
   this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
   prevail against it.
   Matt. 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
   heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
   heaven.
   Matt. 18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
   tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,
   thou hast gained thy brother.
   Matt. 18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or
   two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   established.
   Matt. 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
   church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
   an heathen man and a publican.
   Matt. 18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
   shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
   be loosed in heaven.
   Matt. 18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on
   earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for
   them of my Father which is in heaven.
   John 20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my
   Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
   John 20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith
   unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
   John 20:23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them;
   and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

   Question 85.
   How is the kingdom of heaven shut and opened by christian discipline?
   Answer.
   Thus: when according to the command of Christ,
   those, who under the name of christians,
   maintain doctrines, or practices inconsistent therewith,
   and will not,
   after having been often brotherly admonished,
   renounce their errors and wicked course of life,
   are complained of to the church,
   or to those,
   who are thereunto appointed by the church;
   and if they despise their admonition,
   are by them forbidden the use of the sacraments;
   whereby they are excluded from the christian church,
   and by God himself from the kingdom of Christ;
   and when they promise and show real amendment,
   are again received as members of Christ and his church. (a)

   (a)
   Matt. 18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
   tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,
   thou hast gained thy brother.
   Matt. 18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or
   two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   established.
   Matt. 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
   church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
   an heathen man and a publican.
   Matt. 18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
   shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
   be loosed in heaven.
   1 Cor. 5:2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he
   that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
   1 Cor. 5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
   judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so
   done this deed,
   1 Cor. 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
   together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   1 Cor. 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
   flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
   1 Cor. 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
   man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
   idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an
   one no not to eat.
   2 Thess. 3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note
   that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
   2 Thess. 3:15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
   brother.
   2 Cor. 2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was
   inflicted of many.
   2 Cor. 2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
   comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with
   overmuch sorrow.
   2 Cor. 2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love
   toward him.

The Third Part - Of Thankfulness

   32. Lord's Day

   Question 86.
   Since then we are delivered from our misery,
   merely of grace,
   through Christ,
   without any merit of ours,
   why must we still do good works?
   Answer.
   Because Christ,
   having redeemed and delivered us by his blood,
   also renews us by his Holy Spirit,
   after his own image;
   that so we may testify,
   by the whole of our conduct,
   our gratitude to God for his blessings, (a)
   and that he may be praised by us; (b)
   also,
   that every one may be assured in himself of his faith, (c)
   by the fruits thereof;
   and that, by our godly conversation others may be gained to Christ. (d)

   (a)
   Rom. 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
   unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
   are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
   righteousness unto God.
   Rom. 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
   that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
   God, which is your reasonable service.
   Rom. 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
   the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
   acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
   1 Pet. 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house,
   an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
   God by Jesus Christ.
   1 Pet. 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
   nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him
   who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
   1 Pet. 2:10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the
   people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
   mercy.
   1 Cor. 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in
   your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
   (b)
   Matt. 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
   good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
   1 Pet. 2:12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
   whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good
   works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
   1 Pet. 1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
   be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
   1 Pet. 1:7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
   of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found
   unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
   (c)
   2 Pet. 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
   calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never
   fall:
   Matt. 7:17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
   corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
   Gal. 5:6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
   nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
   Gal. 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
   longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   Gal. 5:23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
   (d)
   1 Pet. 3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
   that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won
   by the conversation of the wives;
   1 Pet. 3:2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with
   fear.
   Rom. 14:19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for
   peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

   Question 87.
   Cannot they then be saved, who,
   continuing in their wicked and ungrateful lives,
   are not converted to God?
   Answer.
   By no means;
   for the holy scripture declares that no unchaste person,
   idolater, adulterer, thief,
   covetous man, drunkard, slanderer,
   robber, or any such like,
   shall inherit the kingdom of God. (a)

   (a)
   1 Cor. 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   1 Cor. 6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
   Eph. 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
   covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
   of Christ and of God.
   Eph. 5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
   things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
   1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because
   we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

   33. Lord's Day

   Question 88.
   Of how many parts does the true conversion of man consist?
   Answer.
   Of two parts;
   of the mortification of the old,
   and the quickening of the new man. (a)

   (a)
   Rom. 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
   may abound?
   Rom. 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
   like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
   even so we also should walk in newness of life.
   Rom. 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
   death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
   Rom. 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
   body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
   sin.
   Eph. 4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
   man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
   Eph. 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
   Eph. 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.
   Col. 3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
   fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,
   and covetousness, which is idolatry:
   Col. 3:6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
   of disobedience:
   Col. 3:7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
   Col. 3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
   blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
   Col. 3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
   man with his deeds;
   Col. 3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
   after the image of him that created him:
   1 Cor. 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
   lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed
   for us:
   2 Cor. 7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
   repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

   Question 89.
   What is the mortification of the old man?
   Answer.
   It is a sincere sorrow of heart,
   that we have provoked God by our sins;
   and more and more to hate and flee from them. (a)

   (a)
   Rom. 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
   through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
   Joel 2:13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
   LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
   great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
   Hos.6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he
   will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

   Question 90.
   What is the quickening of the new man?
   Answer.
   It is a sincere joy of heart in God, through Christ, (a)
   and with love and delight to live according to the will of God in all
   good works. (b)

   (a)
   Rom. 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ:
   Rom. 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
   righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
   Isa. 57:15 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
   eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with
   him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit
   of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
   (b)
   Rom. 6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
   liveth, he liveth unto God.
   Rom. 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
   sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
   Gal. 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
   but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
   live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
   me.

   Question 91.
   But what are good works?
   Answer.
   Only those which proceed from a true faith, (a)
   are performed according to the law of God, (b)
   and to his glory; (c)
   and not such as are founded on our imaginations,
   or the institutions of men. (d)

   (a)
   Rom. 14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
   not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
   (b)
   Lev. 18:4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
   therein: I am the LORD your God.
   1 Sam.15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
   offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,
   to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
   Eph. 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
   (c)
   1 Cor. 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do,
   do all to the glory of God.
   (d)
   Deut. 12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou
   shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
   Ezek. 20:18 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye
   not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments,
   nor defile yourselves with their idols:
   Ezek. 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my
   judgments, and do them;
   Isa. 29:13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near
   me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed
   their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the
   precept of men:
   Matt. 15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
   Matt. 15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
   honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
   Matt. 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
   commandments of men.

   34. Lord's Day

   Question 92.
   What is the law of God?
   Answer.
   God spake all these words,
   Exodus 20:1-17 and Denteronomy 5:6-21, saying:
   I am the LORD thy God,
   which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
   out of the house of bondage.

   1st commandment:
   Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

   2nd commandment:
   Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
   thing that is in heaven above,
   or that is in the earth beneath,
   or that is in the water under the earth.
   Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them;
   for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God,
   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
   and fourth generation of them that hate me,
   and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me,
   and keep my commandments.

   3rd commandment:
   Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;
   for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

   4th commandment:
   Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
   Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;
   but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God:
   in it thou shalt not do any work,
   thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
   thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,
   nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.
   For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth,
   the sea, and all that in them is,
   and rested the seventh day:
   wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day,
   and hallowed it.

   5th commandment:
   Honour thy father and thy mother:
   that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth
   thee.

   6th commandment:
   Thou shalt not kill.

   7th commandment:
   Thou shalt not commit adultery.

   8th commandment:
   Thou shalt not steal.

   9th commandment:
   Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
   10th commandment:
   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house,
   thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,
   nor his manservant, nor his maidservant,
   nor his ox, nor his ass,
   nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

   Question 93.
   How are these commandments divided?
   Answer.
   Into two tables; (a)
   the first of which teaches us how we must behave towards God;
   the second, what duties we owe to our neighbour. (b)

   (a)
   Exod. 34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights;
   he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables
   the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
   Deut. 4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded
   you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
   tables of stone.
   Deut. 10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
   stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two
   tables in mine hand.
   Deut. 10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
   the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of
   the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave
   them unto me.
   (b)
   Matt. 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
   all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
   Matt. 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.
   Matt. 22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbour as thyself.
   Matt. 22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the
   prophets.

   Question 94.
   What does God enjoin in the first commandment?
   Answer.
   That I, as sincerely as I desire the salvation of my own soul,
   avoid and flee from all idolatry, (a)
   sorcery, soothsaying, superstition, (b)
   invocation of saints, or any other creatures; (c)
   and learn rightly to know the only true God; (d)
   trust in him alone, (e)
   with humility (f)
   and patience submit to him; (g)
   expect all good things from him only; (h)
   love, (i)
   fear, (j)
   and glorify him with my whole heart; (k)
   so that I renounce and forsake all creatures,
   rather than commit even the least thing contrary to his will. (l)

   (a)
   1 John 5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
   1 Cor. 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   1 Cor. 6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
   1 Cor. 10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is
   written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
   1 Cor. 10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
   (b)
   Lev. 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek
   after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
   Deut. 18:9 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God
   giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those
   nations.
   Deut. 18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his
   son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination,
   or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
   Deut. 18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
   wizard, or a necromancer.
   Deut. 18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the
   LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
   them out from before thee.
   (c)
   Matt. 4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
   written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
   serve.
   Rev. 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,

   the spirit of prophecy.

   fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep

   Question 95.
   What is idolatry?
   Answer.
   Idolatry is,
   instead of,
   or besides that one true God,
   who has manifested himself in his word,
   to contrive, or have any other object,
   in which men place their trust. (a)

   (a)

   Question 96.
   What does God require in the second commandment?
   Answer.
   That we in no wise represent God by images, (a)
   nor worship him in any other way than he has commanded in his word. (b)

   (a)
   Deut. 4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
   manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb
   out of the midst of the fire:
   Deut. 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
   similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
   Deut. 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
   of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
   Deut. 4:18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
   likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
   Deut. 4:19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
   seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of
   heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the
   LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
   Isa. 40:18 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
   compare unto him?
   Isa. 40:19 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
   spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
   Isa. 40:20 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth
   a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to
   prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
   Isa. 40:21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
   you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of
   the earth?
   Isa. 40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
   inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
   heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
   Isa. 40:23 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges
   of the earth as vanity.
   Isa. 40:24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
   yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also
   blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take
   them away as stubble.
   Isa. 40:25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith
   the Holy One.

   made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
   creeping things.
   Rom. 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
   lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between
   themselves:
   Acts 17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
   to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
   graven by art and man's device.
   (b)
   1 Sam.15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness
   is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the
   LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
   Deut. 12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
   them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou
   enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their
   gods? even so will I do likewise.
   Deut. 12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
   abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their
   gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the
   fire to their gods.
   Deut. 12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou
   shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
   Matt. 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
   commandments of men.

   Question 97.
   Are images then not at all to be made?
   Answer.
   God neither can, nor may be represented by any means: (a)
   but as to creatures;
   though they may be represented,
   yet God forbids to make, or have any resemblance of them,
   either in order to worship them or to serve God by them. (b)

   (a)
   Isa. 40:25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith
   the Holy One.
   (b)

   do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite
   break down their images.

   thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst
   of thee.
   Exod. 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and
   cut down their groves:
   Exod. 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose
   name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
   Exod. 34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
   Num.33:52 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
   before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their
   molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
   Deut. 7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
   altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and
   burn their graven images with fire.
   Deut. 12:3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their
   pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
   graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that
   place.
   Deut. 16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto
   the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.
   2 Kin.18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
   according to all that David his father did.
   2 Kin.18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut
   down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had
   made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to
   it: and he called it Nehushtan.

   Question 98.
   But may not images be tolerated in the churches,
   as books to the laity?
   Answer.
   No:
   for we must not pretend to be wiser than God,
   who will have his people taught,
   not by dump images, (a)
   but by the lively preaching of his word. (b)

   (a)
   Jer. 10:8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
   doctrine of vanities.
   Hab.2:18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
   graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of
   his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
   Hab.2:19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
   Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver,
   and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
   (b)
   Rom. 10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
   believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not
   heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
   Rom. 10:15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
   written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
   peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
   Rom. 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
   God.
   2 Pet. 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
   well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,
   until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
   2 Tim. 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
   profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
   in righteousness:
   2 Tim. 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
   unto all good works.

   36. Lord's Day

   Question 99.
   What is required in the third commandment?
   Answer.
   That we, not only by cursing (a)
   or perjury, (b)
   but also by rash swearing, (c)
   must not profane or abuse the name of God;
   nor by silence or connivance be partakers of these horrible sins in
   others; (d)
   and, briefly,
   that we use the holy name of God no otherwise than with fear and
   reverence; (e)
   so that he may be rightly confessed (f)
   and worshipped by us, (g)
   and be glorified in all our words and works. (h)

   (a)
   Lev. 24:11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
   LORD, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's

   shewed them.
   Lev. 24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
   Lev. 24:14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let
   all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
   congregation stone him.
   Lev. 24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
   Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
   Lev. 24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall
   surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone
   him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he
   blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
   (b)
   Lev. 19:12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt
   thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
   (c)

   whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
   James 5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
   heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your
   yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
   (d)

   witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,
   then he shall bear his iniquity.

   heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

   and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him,
   and in him shall they glory.
   Isa. 45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
   righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow,
   every tongue shall swear.
   (f)
   Rom. 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
   shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,
   thou shalt be saved.
   Rom. 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and
   with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
   Matt. 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
   confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
   (g)
   Ps. 50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
   and thou shalt glorify me.
   1 Tim. 2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
   hands, without wrath and doubting.
   (h)

   songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
   Col. 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
   the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

   Question 100.
   Is then the profaning of God's name, by swearing and cursing,
   so heinous a sin,
   that his wrath is kindled against those who do not endeavour, as much
   as in them lies,
   to prevent and forbid such cursing and swearing?
   Answer.
   It undoubtedly is, (a)
   for there is no sin greater or more provoking to God,
   than the profaning of his name;
   and therefore he has commanded this sin to be punished with death. (b)

   (a)
   Prov. 29:24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he
   heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.
   Lev. 5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
   witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,
   then he shall bear his iniquity.
   (b)
   Lev. 24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
   Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

   surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone
   him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he
   blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.

   37. Lord's Day

   Question 101.
   May we then swear religiously by the name of God?
   Answer.
   Yes:
   either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects;
   or when necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth
   to the glory of God, and the safety of our neighbour:
   for such an oath is founded on God's word, (a)
   and therefore was justly used by the saints,
   both in the Old and New Testament. (b)

   (a)
   Deut. 6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
   swear by his name.
   Deut. 10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and
   to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
   Isa. 48:1 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
   of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear
   by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not
   in truth, nor in righteousness.
   Heb. 6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
   confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
   (b)
   Gen. 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.

   brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in
   the mount.

   to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

   sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not
   touch them.
   1 Sam.24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David
   and his men gat them up unto the hold.
   2 Sam.3:35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat

   1 Kin.1:28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And
   she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
   1 Kin.1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
   redeemed my soul out of all distress,
   1 Kin.1:30 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel,
   saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
   sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
   Rom. 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
   gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in
   my prayers;
   2 Cor. 1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to
   spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

   Question 102.
   May we also swear by saints or any other creatures?
   Answer.
   No;
   for a lawful oath is calling upon God,
   as the only one who knows the heart,
   that he will bear witness to the truth,
   and punish me if I swear falsely; (a)
   which honour is due to no creature. (b)

   (a)
   2 Cor. 1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to
   spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
   Rom. 9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
   bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
   (b)

   it is God's throne:
   Matt. 5:35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
   Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
   Matt. 5:36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
   make one hair white or black.
   James 5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
   heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your
   yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

   Question 103.
   What does God require in the fourth commandment?
   Answer.
   First,
   that the ministry of the gospel and the schools be maintained; (a)
   and that I,
   especially on the sabbath,
   that is, on the day of rest,
   diligently frequent the church of God, (b)
   to hear his word, (c)
   to use the sacraments, (d)
   publicly to call upon the Lord, (e)
   and contribute to the relief of the poor. (f)
   Secondly,
   that all the days of my life
   I cease from my evil works,
   and yield myself to the Lord, to work by his Holy Spirit in me:
   and thus begin in this life the eternal sabbath. (g)

   (a)
   Tit. 1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
   in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city,
   as I had appointed thee:
   2 Tim. 3:14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and
   hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
   2 Tim. 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
   which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is
   in Christ Jesus.

   honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
   1 Cor. 9:11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
   thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

   gospel should live of the gospel.
   2 Tim. 2:2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
   witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to
   teach others also.
   (b)

   declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
   lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

   Question 105.
   What does God require in the sixth commandment?
   Answer.
   That neither in thoughts,
   nor words, nor gestures,
   much less in deeds,
   I dishonour, hate, wound, or kill my neighbour,
   by myself or by another: (a)
   but that I lay aside all desire of revenge: (b)
   also, that I hurt not myself,
   nor wilfully expose myself to any danger. (c)
   Wherefore also the magistrate is armed with the sword,
   to prevent murder. (d)

   that doeth evil.

   Question 106.
   But this commandment seems only to speak of murder?
   Answer.
   In forbidding murder,
   God teaches us, that he abhors the causes thereof,
   such as envy, (a)
   hatred, (b)
   anger, (c)
   and desire of revenge;
   and that he accounts all these as murder. (d)

   (a)
   Prov. 14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
   rottenness of the bones.
   Rom. 1:29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
   wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate,

   that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
   (d)
   1 John 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know
   that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

   Question 107.
   But is it enough that we do not kill any man in the manner mentioned
   above?
   Answer.
   No:
   for when God forbids envy, hatred, and anger,
   he commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves; (a)
   to show patience, peace, meekness, mercy,
   and all kindness, towards him, (b)
   and prevent his hurt as much as in us lies; (c)
   and that we do good, even to our enemies. (d)

   (a)
   Matt. 7:12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do

   you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
   despitefully use you, and persecute you;
   Matt. 5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in
   heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

   give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
   head.

   41. Lord's Day

   Question 108.
   What does the seventh commandment teach us?
   Answer.
   That all uncleanness is accursed of God: (a)
   and that therefore we must with all our hearts detest the same, (b)
   and live chastely and temperately, (c)
   whether in holy wedlock, or in single life. (d)

   (a)
   Lev. 18:27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
   which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

   it spued out the nations that were before you.
   (b)
   Jude 1:23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
   hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
   (c)

   that ye should abstain from fornication:
   1 Thess. 4:4 That every one of you should know how to possess his
   vessel in sanctification and honour;
   1 Thess. 4:5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles
   which know not God:
   (d)
   Heb. 13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
   whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
   1 Cor. 7:7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every
   man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another
   after that.
   1 Cor. 7:8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
   them if they abide even as I.
   1 Cor. 7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
   to marry than to burn.
   1 Cor. 7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
   loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

   Question 109.
   Does God forbid in this commandment,
   only adultery, and such like gross sins?
   Answer.
   Since both our body and soul are temples of the holy Ghost,
   he commands us to preserve them pure and holy:
   therefore he forbids all unchaste actions,
   gestures, words, (a)
   thoughts, desires, (b)
   and whatever can entice men thereto. (c)

   (a)
   Eph. 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
   not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
   Eph. 5:4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
   are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

   Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

   your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
   (b)
   Matt. 5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou
   shalt not commit adultery:
   Matt. 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to
   lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
   (c)
   Eph. 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
   with the Spirit;
   1 Cor. 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

   Question 110.
   What does God forbid in the eighth commandment?
   Answer.
   God forbids not only those thefts, (a)
   and robberies, (b)
   which are punishable by the magistrate;
   but he comprehends under the name of theft all wicked tricks and
   devices,
   whereby we design to appropriate to ourselves the goods which belong to
   our neighbour: (c)
   whether it be by force, or under the appearance of right,
   as by unjust weights, ells, measures, fraudulent merchandise, (d)
   false coins, usury, (e)
   or by any other way forbidden by God;
   as also all covetousness, (f)

   shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously
   with thee.

   bath.

   the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

   are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

   against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
   Luke 6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for

   likewise,
   that in judgment and all other dealings
   I love the truth,

   shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

   1 Pet. 4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:

   44. Lord's Day

   Question 113.
   What does the tenth commandment require of us?
   Answer.
   That even the smallest inclination or thought,
   contrary to any of God's commandments,
   never rise in our hearts;
   but that at all times we hate all sin with our whole heart,
   and delight in all righteousness. (a)

   (a)
   Rom. 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
   not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
   had said, Thou shalt not covet.

   Question 114.
   But can those who are converted to God perfectly keep these
   commandments?
   Answer.
   No: but even the holiest men,
   while in this life,
   have only a small beginning of this obedience; (a)
   yet so, that with a sincere resolution they begin to live,
   not only according to some, but all the commandments of God. (b)

   (a)
   1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
   truth is not in us.
   1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
   1 John 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and
   his word is not in us.
   Rom. 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
   under sin.
   Rom. 7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I
   not; but what I hate, that do I.
   Eccl. 7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
   sinneth not.
   1 Cor. 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   (b)
   Rom. 7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
   Ps. 1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
   he meditate day and night.
   James 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
   one point, he is guilty of all.

   Question 115.
   Why will God then have the ten commandments so strictly preached,
   since no man in this life can keep them?
   Answer.
   First, that all our lifetime we may learn more and more to know (a)
   our sinful nature,
   and thus become the more earnest in seeking the remission of sin,
   and righteousness in Christ; (b)
   likewise, that we constantly endeavour and pray to God for the grace of
   the Holy Spirit,
   that we may become more and more conformable to the image of God,
   till we arrive at the perfection proposed to us,
   in a life to come. (c)

   (a)
   Rom. 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
   justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
   1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
   Ps. 32:5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
   hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
   forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
   (b)
   Matt. 5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness: for they shall be filled.
   Rom. 7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death?
   Rom. 7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
   mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
   (c)
   1 Cor. 9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
   receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
   Philip. 3:11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of
   the dead.
   Philip. 3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which
   also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
   Philip. 3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
   one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
   forth unto those things which are before,
   Philip. 3:14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
   of God in Christ Jesus.

   Of Prayer

   45. Lord's Day

   Question 116.
   Why is prayer necessary for christians?
   Answer.
   Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us:
   (a)
   and also, because God will give his grace and Holy Spirit to those
   only,
   who with sincere desires continually ask them of him, and are thankful
   for them. (b)

   (a)

   findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

   your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
   Spirit to them that ask him?
   1 Thess. 5:17 Pray without ceasing.

   Question 117.
   What are the requisites of that prayer,
   which is acceptable to God, and which he will hear?
   Answer.
   First, that we from the heart pray (a)
   to the one true God only,
   who has manifested himself in his word, (b)
   for all things, he has commanded us to ask of him; (c)
   secondly, that we rightly and thoroughly know our need and misery, (d)
   that so we may deeply humble ourselves in the presence of his divine
   majesty; (e)
   thirdly, that we be fully persuaded that he, notwithstanding that we
   are unworthy of it,
   will, for the sake of Christ our Lord, certainly hear our prayer, (f)
   as he has promised us in his word. (g)

   (a)
   John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
   in spirit and in truth.

   that call upon him in truth.
   (b)
   Rev. 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
   See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that
   have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is
   the spirit of prophecy.
   John 4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
   salvation is of the Jews.
   John 4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
   shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh
   such to worship him.
   John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
   in spirit and in truth.
   (c)
   Rom. 8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
   not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
   1 John 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
   ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
   James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
   all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
   (d)
   2 Chron.20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might

   (f)

   All things necessary for soul and body; (a)
   which Christ our Lord has comprised in that prayer he himself has
   taught us.
   (a)
   James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
   cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
   neither shadow of turning.

   Question 119.

   Our Father which art in heaven,
   1 Hallowed be thy name.
   2 Thy kingdom come.
   3 Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
   4 Give us this day our daily bread.
   5 And forgive us our debts,
   as we forgive our debtors.

   46. Lord's Day

   Question 120.
   Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: "Our Father"?
   Answer.
   That immediately,
   in the very beginning of our prayer,
   he might excite in us a childlike reverence for,
   and confidence in God,
   which are the foundation of our prayer:
   namely, that God is become our Father in Christ,
   and will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith,
   than our parents will refuse us earthly things. (a)

   (a)
   Matt. 7:9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
   he give him a stone?
   Matt. 7:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

   your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
   good things to them that ask him?
   Luke 11:11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father,
   will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give
   him a serpent?
   Luke 11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
   Luke 11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
   your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
   Spirit to them that ask him?

   Question 121.
   Why is it here added, "Which art in heaven"?
   Answer.
   Lest we should form any earthly conceptions of God's heavenly majesty,
   (a)
   and that we may expect from his almighty power all things necessary for
   soul and body. (b)

   (a)
   Jer. 23:23 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?
   Jer. 23:24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see
   him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.
   Acts 17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that
   he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
   hands;
   Acts 17:25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
   any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
   Acts 17:27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
   after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
   (b)
   Rom. 10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
   for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

   Answer.

   that is,
   be pleased to provide us with all things necessary for the body, (a)

   good, (b)
   and that neither our care nor industry,

   (a)

   51. Lord's Day

   Question 126.
   Which is the fifth petition?
   Answer.
   "And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors";
   that is,
   be pleased for the sake of Christ's blood,
   not to impute to us poor sinners,
   our transgressions,
   nor that depravity, which always cleaves to us; (a)
   even as we feel this evidence of thy grace in us,
   that it is our firm resolution from the heart to forgive our neighbour.
   (b)

   (a)
   Ps. 51:1 "To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the
   prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba." Have mercy
   upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the
   multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
   Ps. 51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
   sin.
   Ps. 51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
   me.
   Ps. 51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
   thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
   clear when thou judgest.
   Ps. 51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
   conceive me.

   Ps. 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
   shall be whiter than snow.
   Ps. 143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy
   sight shall no man living be justified.
   1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye
   sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
   Jesus Christ the righteous:
   1 John 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
   only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
   Rom. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
   Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
   (b)
   Matt. 6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
   will also forgive you:
   Matt. 6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
   your Father forgive your trespasses.

   52. Lord's Day

   Question 127.
   Which is the sixth petition?
   Answer.
   "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil";
   that is,
   since we are so weak in ourselves,
   that we cannot stand a moment; (a)
   and besides this, since our mortal enemies,
   the devil, (b)
   the world, (c)
   and our own flesh, (d)
   cease not to assault us,
   do thou therefore preserve and strengthen us by the power of thy Holy
   Spirit,
   that we may not be overcome in this spiritual warfare, (e)
   but constantly and strenuously may resist our foes,
   till at last we obtain a complete victory. (f)

   (a)
   John 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
   and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
   do nothing.
   Ps. 103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
   (b)
   1 Pet. 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
   a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
   Eph. 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
   principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
   this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
   (c)
   John 15:19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
   because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
   world, therefore the world hateth you.
   (d)
   Rom. 7:23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
   of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is
   in my members.
   Gal. 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that
   ye cannot do the things that ye would.
   (e)
   Matt. 26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
   spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
   Mark 13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
   is.
   (f)
   1 Thess. 3:13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in
   holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ with all his saints.
   1 Thess. 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
   God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Question 128.
   How dost thou conclude thy prayer?
   Answer.
   "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
   forever";
   that is,
   all these we ask of thee,
   because thou,
   being our King and almighty,
   art willing and able to give us all good; (a)
   and all this we pray for,
   that thereby not we,
   but thy holy name, may be glorified for ever. (b)

   (a)
   Rom. 10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
   not be ashamed.
   Rom. 10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
   for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
   2 Pet. 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
   temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
   punished:
   (b)
   John 14:13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,
   that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
   Jer. 33:8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
   have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,
   whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against
   me.
   Jer. 33:9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
   before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that
   I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness
   and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
   Ps. 115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
   glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

   Question 129.
   What does the word "Amen" signify?
   Answer.
   "Amen" signifies,
   it shall truly and certainly be:
   for my prayer is more assuredly heard of God,
   than I feel in my heart that I desire these things of him. (a)
   (a)
   2 Cor. 1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him
   Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
   2 Tim. 2:13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
   himself.
