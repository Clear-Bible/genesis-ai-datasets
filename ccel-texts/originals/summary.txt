Chapter I: Religion

   1. The Nature of Religion The Bible informs us that man was created in
   the image of God. When he fell in sin, he did not entirely cease to be
   the image-bearer of the Most High. The seed of religion is still
   present in all men, though their sinful nature constantly reacts
   against it. Missionaries testify to the presence of religion in some
   form or other among all the nations and tribes of the earth. It is one
   of the greatest blessings of mankind, though many denounce it as a
   curse. Not only does it touch the deepest springs of man's life, but it
   also controls his thoughts and feelings and desires.

   But just what is religion? It is only by the study of the Word of God
   that we can learn to know the nature of true religion. The word
   'religion' is derived from the Latin and not from any word that is
   found in the original Hebrew or Greek of the Bible. It is found only
   four times in our translation of the Bible, Gal. 1:18, 14; Jas. 1:26,
   27. The Old Testament defines religion as the fear of the Lord. This
   fear is not a feeling of dread, but of reverent regard for God akin to
   awe, but coupled with love and confidence. It is the response of the
   Old Testament believers to the revelation of the law. In the New
   Testament religion is a response to the gospel rather than to the law,
   and assumes the form of faith and godliness.

   In the light of Scripture we learn to understand that religion is a
   relation in which man stands to God, a relation in which man is
   conscious of the absolute majesty and infinite power of God and of his
   own utter insignificance and absolute helplessness. It may be defined
   as a conscious and voluntary relationship to God, which expresses
   itself in grateful worship and loving service. The manner of this
   religious worship and service is not left to the arbitrary will of man,
   but is determined by God.

   2. The Seat of Religion. There are several wrong views respecting the
   seat of religion in man. Some think of religion primarily as a sort of
   knowledge, and locate it in the intellect. Others regard it as a kind
   of immediate feeling of God, and find its seat in the feelings. And
   still others hold that it consists most of all in moral activity, and
   refer it to the will. However, all these views are one-sided and
   contrary to Scripture, which teaches us that religion is a matter of
   the heart. In Scripture psychology the heart is the central organ of
   the soul. Out of it are all the issues of life, thoughts, feelings, and
   desires, Prov. 4:28. Religion involves the whole man, his intellectual,
   his emotional, and his moral life. This is the only view that does
   justice to the nature of religion.

   3. The Origin of Religion. Particular attention was devoted during the
   last fifty years to the problem of the origin of religion. Repeated
   attempts were made to give a natural explanation of it, but without
   success. Some spoke of it as an invention of cunning and deceptive
   priests, who regarded it as an easy source of revenue; but this
   explanation is entirely discredited now. Others held that it began with
   the worship of lifeless objects (fetishes), or with the worship of
   spirits, possibly the spirits of forefathers. But this is no
   explanation, since the question remains, How did people ever hit upon
   the idea of worshiping lifeless or living objects? Still others were of
   the opinion that religion originated in nature-worship, that is, the
   worship of the marvels and powers of nature, or in the widespread
   practice of magic. But these theories do not explain any more than the
   others how non-religious man ever became religious. They all start out
   with a man who is already religious.

   The Bible gives the only reliable account of the origin of religion. It
   informs us of the existence of God, the only object worthy of religious
   worship. Moreover, it comes to us with the assurance that God, whom man
   could never discover with his natural powers, revealed Himself in
   nature and, more especially, in His divine Word, demands the worship
   and service of man, and also determines the worship and service that is
   well-pleasing to Him. And, finally, it teaches us that God created man
   in His own image, and thus endowed him with a capacity to understand,
   and to respond to, this revelation, and engendered in him a natural
   urge to seek communion with God and to glorify Him.

   To memorize. Scripture passages bearing on:

   a. The Nature of Religion:

   Deut. 10:12, 18. "And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of
   thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love
   Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
   soul, to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and His statutes, which I
   command thee this day for thy good."

   Ps. 111:10. "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good
   understanding have all they that do His commandments: His praise
   endureth for ever."

   Eccl. 12:13. "Fear God and keep His commandments; for this is the whole
   duty of man."

   John 6:29. "This is the work of 'God, that ye believe on Him whom He
   hath sent."

   Acts 16:31. "And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt
   be saved, thou and thy house."

   b. The Seat of Religion.

   Ps. 61:10. "Create in me a clean heart, God; and renew a right spirit
   within me." Also vs. 17. "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a
   broken and a contrite heart, God, thou wilt not despise."

   Prov. 4:28. "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
   issues of life."

   Matt. 6:8. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."

   C. The Origin of Religion.

   Gen. 1:27. "And God created man in His own image, in the image of God
   created He him."

   Deut. 4:18. "And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded
   you to perform, even the ten commandments."

   Ezek. 37:26. "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
   put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
   and I will give you a heart of flesh."

Chapter II: Revelation

   1. Revelation in General. The discussion of religion naturally leads on
   to that of revelation as its origin. If God had not revealed Himself,
   religion would have been impossible. Man could not possibly have had
   any knowledge of God, if God had not made Himself known. Left to
   himself, he would never have discovered God. We distinguish between
   God's revelation in nature and His revelation in Scripture.

   Atheists and Agnostics, of course, do not believe in revelation.
   Pantheists sometimes speak of it, though there is really no place for
   it in their system of thought. And Deists admit the revelation of God
   in nature, but deny the necessity, the reality, and even the
   possibility of any special revelation such as we have in Scripture. We
   believe in both general and special revelation.

   2. General Revelation. The general revelation of God is prior to His
   special revelation in point of time. It does not come to man in the
   form of verbal communications, but in the facts, the forces, and the
   laws of nature, in the constitution and operation of the human mind,
   and in the facts of experience and history. The Bible refers to it in
   such passages as Ps. 19:1, 2; Rom. 1:19, 20; 2:14, 15.

   a. Insufficiency of general revelation. While Pelagians, Rationalists,
   and Deists regard this revelation as adequate for our present needs,
   Roman Catholics and Protestants are agreed that it is not sufficient.
   It was obscured by the blight of sin resting on God's beautiful
   creation. The handwriting of the Creator was not entirely erased, but
   became hazy and indistinct. It does not now convey any fully reliable
   knowledge of God and spiritual things, and therefore does not furnish
   us a trustworthy foundation on which we can build for our eternal
   future. The present religious confusion of those who would base their
   religion on a purely natural basis clearly proves its insufficiency. It
   does not even afford an adequate basis for religion in general, much
   less for true religion. Even gentile nations appeal to some supposed
   special revelation. And, finally, it utterly fails to meet the
   spiritual needs of sinners. While it conveys some knowledge of the
   goodness, the wisdom, and the power of God, it conveys no knowledge
   whatever of Christ as the only way of salvation.

   b. Value of general revelation. This does not mean, however, that
   general revelation has no value at all. It accounts for the true
   elements that are still found in heathen religions. Due to this
   revelation gentiles feel themselves to be the offspring of God, Acts
   17:28, seek after God if haply they might find Him, Acts 17:27, see in
   nature God's everlasting power and divinity, Rom. 1:19, 20, and do by
   nature the things of the law, Rom. 2:14. Though they live in the
   darkness of sin and ignorance, and pervert the truth of God, they still
   share in the illumination of the Word, John 1:9, and in the general
   operations of the Holy Spirit, Gen. 6:3. Moreover, the general
   revelation of God also forms the background for His special revelation.
   The latter could not be fully understood without the former. Science
   and history do not fail to illumine the pages of the Bible.

   3. Special Revelation. In addition to the revelation of God in nature
   we have His special revelation which is now embodied in Scripture. The
   Bible is preeminently the book of God's special revelation, a
   revelation in which facts and words go hand in hand, the words
   interpreting the facts and the facts giving substance to the words.

   a. Necessity of special revelation. This special revelation became
   necessary through the entrance of sin into the world. God's handwriting
   in nature was obscured and corrupted, and man was stricken with
   spiritual blindness, became subject to error and unbelief, and now in
   his blindness and perverseness fails to read aright even the remaining
   traces of the original revelation, and is unable to understand any
   further revelation of God. Therefore it became necessary that God
   should re-interpret the truths of nature, should provide a new
   revelation of redemption, and should illumine the mind of man and
   redeem it from the power of error.

   b. Means of special revelation. In giving His special or supernatural
   revelation God used different kinds of means, such as (1) Theophanies
   or visible manifestations of God. He revealed His presence in fire and
   clouds of smoke, Ex. 8:2; 33:9: Ps. 78:14; 99:7; in stormy winds, Job
   38:1; Ps .18:10-16, and in a "still small voice," I Kings 19:12. These
   were all tokens of His presence, revealing something of His glory.
   Among the Old Testament appearances those of the Angel of Jehovah, the
   second Person of the Trinity, occupied a prominent place, Gen. 16:13;
   31:11; Ex. 23:20-23; Mal. 3:1. The highest point of the personal
   appearance of God among men was reached in the incarnation of Jesus
   Christ. In Him the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, John
   1:14. (2) Direct communications. Sometimes God spoke to men in an
   audible voice, as He did to Moses and the children of Israel, Deut.
   5:4, and sometimes He suggested His messages to the prophets by an
   internal operation of the Holy Spirit, I Pet. 1:11. Moreover, He
   revealed Himself in dreams and visions, and by means of Urim and
   Thummim, Num. 12:6; 27:21; Isa. 6. And in the New Testament Christ
   appears as the great Teacher sent from God to reveal the Father's will;
   and through His Spirit the apostles become the organs of further
   revelations, John 14:26; I Cor. 2:12, 13; I Thess. 2:13. (3) Miracles.
   The miracles of the Bible should never be regarded as mere marvels
   which fill men with amazement, but as essential parts of God's special
   revelation. They are manifestations of the special power of God, tokens
   of His special presence, and often serve to symbolize spiritual truths.
   They are signs of the coming Kingdom of God and of the redemptive power
   of God. The greatest miracle of all is the coming of the Son of God in
   the flesh. In Him the whole creation of God is being restored and
   brought back to its original beauty, I Tim. 3:16; Rev. 21:5.

   c. The character of special revelation. This special revelation of God
   is a revelation of redemption. It reveals the plan of God for the
   redemption of sinners and of the world, and the way in which this plan
   is realized. It is instrumental in renewing man; it illumines his mind
   and inclines his will to that which is good; it fills him with holy
   affections, and prepares him for his heavenly home. Not only does it
   bring us a message of redemption; it also acquaints us with redemptive
   facts. It not only enriches us with knowledge, but also transforms
   lives by changing sinners into saints. This revelation is clearly
   progressive. The great truths of redemption appear but dimly at first,
   but gradually increase in clearness, and finally stand out in the New
   Testament in all their fullness and beauty.

   To memorize. Scripture passages bearing on:

   a. General Revelation:
   Ps. 8:1. " Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the
   earth."

   Ps. 19:1, 2. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
   showeth His handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto
   night showeth wisdom."

   Rom. 1:20. "For the invisible things of Him since the creation of the
   world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are
   made, even His everlasting power and divinity." Rom. 2:14, 15. "For
   when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law,
   these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves; in that they show
   the work of the law written in their hearts, their consciences bearing
   witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else
   excusing them."

   Num. 12:6-8. "And He said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet
   among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I
   will speak with him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so; he is
   faithful in all my house: with him will I speak mouth to mouth."

   Heb. 1:1. "God having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the
   prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, hath in the end of
   these days spoken unto us in His Son."

   II Pet. 1:21. "For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men
   spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit."

   For Further Study:

   a. Mention some of the appearances of the Angel of Jehovah. Can he have
   been a mere angel? Gen. 16:13; 31:11, 13; 32:28; Ex. 23:20-23.

   b. Name some examples of revelation by dreams. Gen. 28:10- 17; 31:24;
   41:2-7; Judg. 7:13; I Kings 8:5-9; Dan. 2:1-3; Matt. 2:13, 19, 20.

   c. Mention some cases in which God revealed Himself in visions. Isa. 6;
   Ezek. 1-3; Dan. 2:19; 7:1-14; Zech. 2-6.

   d. Can you infer from the following passages what the miracles recorded
   reveal? Ex. 10:1, 2; Deut. 8:3; John 2:1-11; 6:1- 14, 25-35; 9:1-7;
   11:17-44.

Chapter III: Scripture

   1. Revelation and Scripture. The term 'special revelation' may be used
   in more than one sense. It may denote the direct self-communications of
   God in verbal messages and in miraculous facts. The prophets and the
   apostles often received messages from God long before they committed
   them to writing. These are now contained in Scripture, but do not
   constitute the whole of the Bible. There is much in it that was not
   revealed in a supernatural way, but is the result of study and of
   previous reflection. However, the term may also be used to denote the
   Bible as a whole, that whole complex of redemptive truths and facts,
   with the proper historical setting, that is found in Scripture and has
   the divine guarantee of its truth in the fact that it is infallibly
   inspired by the Holy Spirit. In view of this fact it may be said that
   the whole Bible, and the Bible only, is for us God's special
   revelation. It is in the Bible that God's special revelation lives on
   and brings even now life, light, and holiness.

   2. Scripture Proof for the Inspiration of Scripture. The whole Bible is
   given by inspiration of God, and is as such the infallible rule of
   faith and practice for all mankind. Since the doctrine of inspiration
   is often denied, it calls for special consideration.

   This doctrine, like every other, is based on Scripture, and is not an
   invention of man. While it is founded on a great number of passages,
   only a few of these can be indicated here. The Old Testament writers
   are repeatedly instructed to write what the Lord commands them, Ex,
   17:14; 34:27; Num. 33:2; Isa. 8:1; 30:8; Jer. 25:13; 30:2; Ezek. 24:1;
   Dan. 12:4; Hab. 2:2. The prophets were conscious of bringing the word
   of the Lord, and therefore introduced their messages with some such
   formula as, "Thus saith the Lord," or, "The word of the Lord came unto
   me," Jer. 36:27, 32; Ezek., chapters 26, 27, 31, 32, 39. Paul speaks of
   his words as Spirit-taught words, I Cor. 2:13, claims that Christ is
   speaking in him, II Cor. 13:3, and describes his message to the
   Thessalonians as the word of God, I Thess. 2:13. The Epistle to the
   Hebrews often quotes passages of the Old Testament as words of God or
   of the Holy Spirit, Heb. 1:6; 3:7; 4:3;" 5:6; 7:21. The most important
   passage to prove the inspiration of Scripture is II Tim. 3:16, which
   reads as follows in the Authorized Version: "All Scripture is given by
   inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness."

   3. The Nature of Inspiration. There are especially two wrong views of
   inspiration, representing extremes that should be avoided.

   a. Mechanical inspiration. It has sometimes been represented as if God
   literally dictated what the human authors of the Bible had to write,
   and as if they were purely passive like a pen in the hand of a writer.
   This means that their minds did not contribute in any way to the
   contents or form of their writings. But in view of what we find this
   can hardly be true. They were real authors, who in some cases gathered
   their materials from sources at their command, I Kings 11:41; 14:29; I
   Chron. 29:29; Luke 1:1-4, in other instances recorded their own
   experiences as, for instance, in many of the psalms, and impressed upon
   their writings their own particular style. The style of Isaiah differs
   from that of Jeremiah, and the style of John is not like that of Paul.

   b. Dynamic inspiration. Others thought of the process of inspiration as
   affecting only the writers, and having no direct bearing on their
   writings. Their mental and spiritual life was strengthened and raised
   to a higher pitch, so that they saw things more clearly and had a more
   profound sense of their real spiritual value. This inspiration was not
   limited to the time when they wrote the books of the Bible, but was a
   permanent characteristic of the writers and affected their writings
   only indirectly. It differed only in degree from the spiritual
   illumination of all believers. This theory certainly does not do
   justice to the biblical view of inspiration.

   c. Organic inspiration. The proper conception of inspiration holds that
   the Holy Spirit acted on the writers of the Bible in an organic way, in
   harmony with the laws of their own inner being, using them just as they
   were, with their character and temperament, their gifts and talents,
   their education and culture, their vocabulary and style. The Holy
   Spirit illumined their minds, aided their memory, prompted them to
   write, repressed the influence of sin on their writings, and guided
   them in the expression of their thoughts even to the choice of their
   words. In no small measure He left free scope to their own activity.
   They could give the results of their own investigations, write of their
   own experiences, and put the imprint of their own style and language on
   their books.

   4. The Extent of Inspiration. There are differences of opinion also
   respecting the extent of the inspiration of Scripture. a. Partial
   inspiration. Under the influence of Rationalism it has become quite
   common to deny the inspiration of the Bible altogether, or to hold that
   only parts of it are inspired. Some deny the inspiration of the Old
   Testament, while admitting that of the New. Others affirm that the
   moral and religious teachings of Scripture are inspired, but that its
   historical parts contain several chronological, archaeological, and
   scientific mistakes. Still others limit the inspiration to the Sermon
   on the Mount. They who adopt such views have already lost their Bible,
   for the very differences of opinion are proof positive that no one can
   determine with any degree of certainty which parts of Scripture are,
   and which are not inspired. There is still another way in which the
   inspiration of Scripture is limited, namely, by assuming that the
   thoughts were inspired, while the choice of the words was left entirely
   to the wisdom of the human authors. But this proceeds on the very
   doubtful assumption that the thoughts can be separated from the words,
   while, as a matter of fact, accurate thought without words is
   impossible.

   b. Plenary inspiration. According to Scripture every part of the Bible
   is inspired. Jesus and the apostles frequently appeal to the Old
   Testament books as 'scripture' or 'the Scriptures' to settle a point in
   controversy. To their minds such an appeal was equivalent to an appeal
   to God. It should be noted that of the books to which they appeal in
   this fashion, some are historical. The Epistle to the Hebrews
   repeatedly cites passages from the Old Testament as words of God or of
   the Holy Spirit (cf. p. 18). Peter places the letters of Paul on a
   level with the writings of the Old Testament, II Pet. 3:16, and Paul
   speaks of all Scripture as inspired, II Tim. 3:16.

   We may safely go a step farther and say that the inspiration of the
   Bible extends to the very words employed. The Bible is verbally
   inspired, which is not equivalent to saying that it is mechanically
   inspired. The doctrine of verbal inspiration is fully warranted by
   Scripture. In many cases we are explicitly told that the Lord told
   Moses and Joshua exactly what to write, Lev. 3 and 4; 6:1, 24; 7:22,
   28; Josh. 1:1; 4:1; 6:2, and so on. The prophets speak of Jehovah as
   putting His words into their mouths, Jer. 1:9, and as directing them to
   speak His words to the people, Ezek. 3:4, 10, 11. Paul designates his
   words as Spirit taught words, I Cor. 2:13, and both he and Jesus base
   an argument on a single word, Matt. 22:43-45; John 10:35; Gal. 3:16.

   5. The Perfections of Scripture. The Reformers developed the doctrine
   of Scripture as over against the Roman Catholics and some of the
   Protestant sects. While Rome taught that the Bible owes its authority
   to the Church, they maintained that it has authority in itself as the
   inspired Word of God. They also upheld the necessity of Scripture as
   the divinely appointed means of grace over against the Roman Catholics,
   who asserted that the Church had no absolute need of it, and some of
   the Protestant sects, who exalted the "inner light," or the word of the
   Holy Spirit in the hearts of the people of God, at the expense of
   Scripture. In opposition to Rome they further defended the clearness of
   the Bible. They did not deny that it contains mysteries too deep for
   human understanding, but simply contended that the knowledge necessary
   unto salvation, though not equally clear on every page of the Bible, is
   yet conveyed in a manner so simple that anyone earnestly seeking
   salvation can easily gather this knowledge for himself, and need not
   depend on the interpretation of the Church or the priesthood. Finally,
   they also defended the sufficiency of Scripture, and thereby denied the
   need of the tradition of the Roman Catholics and of the inner light of
   the Anabaptists.

   Passages bearing on:

   a. The inspiration of Scripture:
   I Cor. 2:13. "Which things also we speak, not in words which man's
   wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual
   things with spiritual words."

   I Thess. 2:13. "And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing,
   that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word
   of God, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth,
   the word of God."

   II Tim. 3:16. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
   profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
   in righteousness."

   b. The authority of the Bible:
   Isa. 8:20. "To the lay and to the testimony! if they speak not
   according to this word, surely there is no morning for them."

   c. The necessity of the Bible:
   II Tim. 3:15. "And that from a babe thou has known the sacred writings,
   which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is
   in Christ Jesus."

   a. The clearness of Scripture:
   Ps. 19:7b. "The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple."

   Ps. 119:105. "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my
   path." Also verse 130. "The opening of Thy words giveth light; it

Chapter IV: The Essential Nature of God

   1. The Knowledge of God. The possibility of knowing God has been denied
   on several grounds. But while it is true that man can never fully
   comprehend God, it does not follow that he can have no knowledge of Him
   at all. He can know Him only in part, but nevertheless with a knowledge
   which is real and true. This is possible because God has revealed
   Himself. Left to his own resources, man would never have been able to
   discover nor to know Him.

   Our knowledge of God is twofold. Man has an inborn knowledge of God.
   This does not merely mean that, in virtue of his creation in the image
   of God, he has a natural capacity to know God. Neither does it imply
   that man at birth brings a certain knowledge of God with him into the
   world. It simply means that under normal conditions a certain knowledge
   of God naturally develops in man. This knowledge is, of course, of a
   very general nature.

   But in addition to this inborn knowledge of God man also acquires
   knowledge of Him by learning from God's general and special revelation.
   This is not obtained without efforts on man's part, but is the result
   of his conscious and sustained pursuit of knowledge. While this
   knowledge is possible only because man is born with the capacity to
   know God, it carries him far beyond the limits of the inborn knowledge
   of God.

   2. The Knowledge of God as Known from Special Revelation. While it is
   not possible to define God, it is possible to give a general
   description of His being. It is perhaps best to describe Him as a pure
   Spirit of infinite perfections. The description involves the following
   elements:

   a. God is a pure Spirit. The Bible contains no definition of God. The
   nearest approach to it is found in the words of Jesus to the Samaritan
   woman, "God is spirit." This means that He is essentially spirit, and
   that all the qualities which belong to the perfect idea of spirit are
   necessarily found in Him. The fact that He is pure spirit excludes the
   idea that He has a body of some kind and is in any way visible to the
   physical eye. b. God is personal. The fact that God is spirit also
   involves His personality. A spirit is an intelligent and moral being,
   and when we ascribe personality to God, we mean exactly that He is a
   reasonable Being, capable of determining the course of His life. At
   present many deny the personality of God and simply conceive of Him as
   an impersonal force or power. However, the God of the Bible is
   certainly a personal God, a God with whom men can converse, whom they
   can trust, who enters into their experiences, who helps them in their
   difficulties, and who fills their hearts with joy and gladness.
   Moreover, He revealed Himself in a personal form in Jesus Christ.

   c. God is infinitely perfect. God is distinguished from all His
   creatures by infinite perfection. His being and virtues are free from
   all limitations and imperfections. He is not only boundless and
   limitless, but also stands out above all His creatures in moral
   perfection and in glorious majesty. The children of Israel sang of the
   greatness of God after they passed through the Red Sea: "Who is like
   unto Thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like Thee, glorious in
   holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?" Ex. 15:11. Some
   philosophers of the present day speak of God as "finite, developing,
   struggling, suffering, sharing with man his defeats and victory."

   d. God and His perfections are one. Simplicity is one of the
   fundamental characteristics of God. This means that He is not composed
   of different parts, and also that His being and attributes are one. It
   may be said that God's perfections are God Himself as He has revealed
   Himself to man. They are simply so many manifestations of the divine
   Being. Hence the Bible says that God is truth, life, light, love,
   righteousness, and so on.

   To memorize. Passages proving:

   a. That God can be known:
   I John 5:20. "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given
   us an understanding, that we know Him that is true, and we are in Him
   that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ."

   John 17:3. "And this is life eternal, that they should know thee, the
   only true God, and Him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ."

   b. That God is n Spirit:
   John 4:24. "God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him
   in spirit and in truth."

   I Tim. 6:16. "Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light
   unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see."

   c. That God is personal:
   Mal. 2:10. "Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us?"

   John 14:9b. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest
   thou, Show us the Father?"

   d. That God is infinite in perfection:
   Ex. 15:11. "Who is like unto Thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like
   Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"

   Ps. 147:5. "Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding
   is infinite."

   For Further Study:

   a. Do not the following passages teach that we cannot know God? Job
   11:7; 26:14; 36:26.

   b. If God is a spirit and has no body, how do you explain the following
   passages? Ps. 4:6; 17:2; 18:6, 8, 9; 31:5; 44:3; 47:8; 48:10, and many
   others.

   C. How do the following passages testify to the personality of God?
   Gen. 1:1; Deut. 1:34, 35,; I Kings 8:23-26; Job 38:1; Ps. 21:7; 50:6;
   103:3-5; Matt. 5:9; Rom. 12:1.

     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter V: The Names of God

   When God gives names to persons or things, they are names which have
   meaning and give an insight into the nature of the persons or things
   designated. This also applies to the names which God has given Himself.
   Sometimes the Bible speaks of the name of God in the singular, and in
   such cases the term is a designation of the manifestation of God in
   general, especially in relation to His people, Ex. 20:7; Ps. 113:3; or
   simply stands for God Himself, Prov. 18:10; Isa. 50:10. The one general
   name of God is split up into several special names, which are
   expressive of His many-sided being. These names are not of human
   invention, but are given by God Himself.

   1. The Old Testament Names of God. Some of the Old Testament names
   denote that God is the High and Exalted One. 'El and 'Elohim indicate
   that He is strong and mighty and should therefore be feared, while
   'Elyon points to His exalted nature as the Most High, the object of
   reverence and worship. Another name belonging to this class is 'Adonai,
   usually rendered "Lord," the Possessor and Ruler of all men. Other
   names express the fact that God enters into relations of friendship
   with His creatures. One of these, common among the patriarchs, was the
   name Shaddai or 'El-Shaddai, which indeed stresses the divine
   greatness, but as a source of comfort and blessing for His people. It
   indicates that God controls the powers of nature, and makes them serve
   His purposes. The greatest name of God, however, always held sacred by
   the Jews, is the name Jehovah (Yahweh). Its origin and meaning is
   indicated in Ex. 3:14, 15. It expresses the fact that God is always the
   same, and especially that He is unchangeable in His covenant
   relationship, and is always faithful in the fulfilment of His promises.
   It frequently assumes a fuller form in "Jehovah of Hosts." This calls
   up the picture of Jehovah as the King of Glory surrounded by angelic
   hosts.

   2. The New Testament Names of God. The New Testament names are simply
   the Greek forms of those found in the Old Testament. The following
   deserve particular attention: a. The name Theos. This is simply the
   word for 'God,' and is the most common name employed in the New
   Testament. It is frequently found with a possessive genitive as 'my
   God,' 'thy God,' 'our God,' 'your God.' In Christ God is the God of
   each one of His children. The individual form takes the place of the
   national form, 'the God of Israel,' so common in the Old Testament.

   b. The name Kurios. This is the word for 'Lord,' a name that is applied
   not only to God but also to Christ. It takes the place of both 'Adonai
   and Jehovah, though its meaning corresponds more particularly with that
   of 'Adonai. It designates God as the Possessor and Ruler of all things,
   and especially of His people.

   c. The name Pater. It is often said that the New Testament introduced
   this as a new name. But this is hardly correct, for the name 'Father'
   is also found in the Old Testament to express the special relation in
   which God stands to Israel, Deut. 32:6; Isa. 63:16. In the New
   Testament it is more individual in that it points to God as the Father
   of all believers. Sometimes it designates God as the creator of all, I
   Cor. 8:6; Eph. 3:14; Heb. 12:9; Jas. 1:17, and sometimes the first
   Person of the Trinity as the Father of Christ, John 14:11; 17:1.

   To memorize. Passages bearing on:

   a. The name of God in general:
   Ex. 20:7. "Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for
   Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain."

   Ps. 8:1. " Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the
   earth!"

   b. Particular names:
   Gen. 1:1. "In the beginning God ('Elohim) created the heavens and the
   earth."

   Ex. 6:3. "And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as
   God Almighty ('El Shaddai); but by my name Jehovah I was not known unto
   them."

   Ps. 86:8. "There is none like Thee among the gods, Lord ('Adonai);
   neither are there any works like unto Thy works."

   Mal. 3:6. "For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, sons of Jacob, are
   not consumed."

   Matt. 6:9. "Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name."

   Rev. 4:8. "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord (Kurios) God, the Almighty,
   who was and who is and who is to come."

   For Further Study:

   a. What light does Ex. 8:13-16 shed on the meaning of the name Jehovah?

   b. What name of God was rather common in the times of the patriarchs?
   Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 43:14; 48:38; 49:25; Ex. 6:3.

   c. Can you give some descriptive names of God? Isa. 48:3, 15; 44:6;
   Amos 4:13; Luke 1:78; II Cor. 1:3; 11:31; Jos. 1:17; Heb. 12:9; Rev.
   1:8, 17.

   Questions for Review

   1. What does Scripture mean when it speaks of the name of God in the
   singular?

   2. Are the special names of God of human origin?

   3. What two kinds of names do we distinguish in the Old Testament?

   4. What is the meaning of the names 'Elohim, Jehovah, 'Adonai, 'El
   Shaddai, and Kurios? 5. Is the name Father ever applied to God in the
   Old Testament? 6. In what different senses is this name used in the New
   Testaments?

  Chapter VI: The Attributes of God

   God reveals Himself not only in His names, but also in His attributes,
   that is, in the perfections of the divine Being. It is customary to
   distinguish between incommunicable and communicable attributes. Of the
   former there are no traces in the creature; of the latter there are.

   1. The Incommunicable Attributes. These emphasize the absolute
   distinction between God and the creature, and include the following:

   a. The independence or self-existence of God. This means that God has
   the ground of His existence in Himself, and unlike man, does not depend
   on anything outside of Himself. He is independent in His Being, in His
   virtues and actions, and causes all His creatures to depend on Him. The
   idea is embodied in the name Jehovah and finds expression in the
   following passages, Ps. 33:11; 115:3; Isa. 40:18 ff.; Dan. 4:35; John
   5:26; Rom. 11:33-36; Acts 17:25; Rev. 4:11.

   b. The immutability of God. Scripture teaches that God is unchangeable.
   He is forever the same in His divine Being and perfections, and also in
   His purposes and promises, Num. 23:19; Psa. 33:11; 102:27; Mal. 3:6;
   Heb. 6:17; Jas. 1:17. This does not mean, however, that there is no
   movement in God. The Bible speaks of Him as coming and going, hiding
   and revealing Himself. He is also said to repent, but this is evidently
   only a human way of speaking of God, Ex. 32:14; Jonah 3:10, and really
   indicates a change in man's relation to God.

   c. The infinity of God. This means that God is not subject. to
   limitations. We can speak of His infinity in more than one sense.
   Viewed in relation to His being, it may be called His absolute
   perfection. He is unlimited in His knowledge and wisdom, in His
   goodness and love, in His righteousness and holiness, Job 11:7-10; Psa.
   145:3. Seen in relation to time, it is called His eternity. While this
   is usually represented in Scripture as endless duration, Ps. 90:2;
   102:12, it really means that He is above time and therefore not subject
   to its limitations. For Him there is only an eternal present, and no
   past or future. Viewed with reference to space, it is called His
   immensity. He is everywhere present, dwells in all His creatures,
   filling every point of space, but is in no way bounded by space, I
   Kings 8:27; Ps. 139:7-10; Isa. 66;1; Jer. 23:23, 24; Acts 17:27, 28.

   d. The simplicity of God. By ascribing simplicity to God we mean that
   He is not composed of various parts, such as the body and soul in man,
   and for that very reason is not subject to division. The three persons
   in the Godhead are not so many parts of which the divine essence is
   composed. The whole being of God belongs to each one of the Persons.
   Hence we can also say that God and His attributes are one, and that He
   is life, light, love, righteousness, truth, and so on.

   2. The Communicable Attributes. These are the attributes of which we
   find some resemblance in man. It should be borne in mind, however, that
   what we see in man is only a finite (limited) and imperfect likeness of
   that which is infinite (unlimited) and perfect in God. Here we have:

   a. The knowledge of God. This is that perfection of God whereby He, in
   a manner all His own, knows Himself and all things possible and actual.
   God has this knowledge in Himself, and does not obtain it from without.
   It is always complete and always present in His mind. And because it is
   all-comprehensive, it is called omniscience. He knows all things, past,
   present and future, and not only the things that have real existence,
   but also those which are merely possible. I Kings 8:29; Ps. 139:1-16;
   Isa. 46:10; Ezek. 11:5; Acts 15:18; John 21:17; Heb. 4:13.

   b. The wisdom of God. God's wisdom is an aspect of His knowledge. It is
   the virtue of God which manifest itself in the selection of worthy ends
   and in the choice of the best means for the realization of those ends.
   The final end to which He makes all things subservient is His own
   glory. Rom. 11:33; I Cor. 2:7; Eph. 1:6, 12, 14; Col. 1:16.

   c. The goodness of God. God is good, that is, perfectly holy. in
   Himself. But this is not the goodness we have in mind here. In this
   connection we refer to the divine goodness that reveals itself in doing
   well unto others. It is that perfection which prompts Him to deal
   kindly and bounteously with all His creatures The Bible refers to it
   repeatedly, Ps. 36:6; 104:21; 145:8, 9, 16; Matt. 5:45; Acts 14:17.

   d. The love of God. This is often called the most central attribute of
   God, but it is doubtful whether it should be regarded as more central
   than the other perfections of God. In virtue of it He delights in His
   own perfections and in man as the reflection of His image. It may be
   considered from various points of view. The unmerited love of God which
   reveals itself in pardoning sin is called His grace, Eph. 1:6, 7;
   2:7-9; Tit. 2:11. That love relieving the misery of those who are
   bearing the consequences of sin is known as His mercy or tender
   compassion, Luke 1:64, 72, 78; Rom. 15:9; 9:16, 18; Eph. 2:4. And when
   it bears with the sinner who does not heed the instructions and
   warnings of God it is named His longsuffering or forbearance, Rom. 2:4;
   9:22; I Pet. 3:20; II Pet. 3:16.

   e. The holiness of God. God's holiness is first of all that divine
   perfection by which He is absolutely distinct from all His creatures,
   and exalted above them in infinite majesty. Ex. 15:11; Isa. 57:15. But
   it denotes in the second place that He is free from all moral impurity
   or sin, and is therefore morally perfect. In the presence of the holy
   God man is deeply conscious of his sin, Job 34:10; Isa. 6:5; Hab. 1:13.

   f. The righteousness of God. The righteousness of God is that
   perfection by which He maintains Himself as the Holy One over against
   every violation of His holiness. In virtue of it He maintains a moral
   government in the world and imposes a just law on man, rewarding
   obedience and punishing disobedience, Ps. 99:4; Isa. 33:22; Rom, 1:32.
   The justice of God which manifests itself in the giving of rewards is
   called His remunerative justice; and that which reveals itself in
   meting out punishment is known as His retributive justice. The former
   is really an expression of His love, and the latter of His wrath.

   g. The veracity of God. This is that perfection of God in virtue of
   which He is true in His inner being, in His revelation, and in His
   relation to His people. He is the true God over against the idols,
   knows things as they really are, and is faithful in the fulfillment of
   His promises. From the last point of view this attribute is also called
   God's faithfulness. Num. 23:19; I Cor. 1:9; II Tim. 2:13; Heb. 10:23.

   h. The sovereignty of God. This may be considered from two different
   points of view, namely, His sovereign will, and His sovereign power.
   The will of God is represented in Scripture as the final cause of all
   things, Eph. 4:11; Rev. 4:11. On the basis of Deut. 29:29 it is
   customary to distinguish between the secret and the revealed will of
   God. The former is the will of God's decree, which is hidden in God and
   can be known only from its effects, and the latter is the will of His
   precept, which is revealed in the law and in the gospel. God's will
   respecting His creatures is absolutely free, Job 11:10; 33:13; Ps.
   115:3; Prov. 21:1; Matt. 20:15; Rom. 9:15-18; Rev. 4:11. The sinful
   deeds of man are also under the control of His sovereign will, Gen.
   50:20; Acts 2:23. The power to execute His will is called his
   omnipotence. That God is omnipotent does not mean that He can do
   everything. The Bible teaches us that there are some things which God
   cannot do. He cannot lie, sin, deny Himself, Num. 23:19; I Sam. 15:29;
   II Tim. 2:13; Heb. 6:18; Jas. 1:13, 17. It does mean that He can, by
   the mere exercise of Hie will, bring to pass whatsoever He has decided
   to accomplish, and that, if He so desired, He could do even more than
   that, Gen. 18:14; Jer. 32:27; Zech. 8:6; Matt. 3:9; 26:53.

   take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
   sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold
   me."
   Jer. 23:23, 24. "Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar
   off? Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him'
   saith Jehovah. Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah?"

   sojourning in fear."

   Veracity or faithfulness. Num. 23:19. "God is not a man, that He should
   lie, neither the son of man, that He should repent. Hath He said, and
   will He not do it? Or hath He spoken, and will He not make it good?"
   II Tim. 2:13. "If we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for He cannot
   deny Himself."

   Sovereignty. Eph. 1:11. "In whom also we were made a heritage, having
   been foreordained according to the purpose of Him who worketh all
   things after the council of His will."
   Rev. 4:11. "Worthy art Thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory
   and the honor and the power; for Thou didst create all things, and
   because of Thy will they were, and were created."

   Secret and revealed will. Deut. 29:29. "The secret things belong unto
   Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to
   our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."

   Omnipotence. Job 42:2. "I know that Thou canst do everything." Matt.
   19:26. "With God all things are possible." Luke 1:37. "For with God
   nothing shall be impossible."

Chapter VII: The Trinity

   1. Statement of the Doctrine. The Bible teaches that, while He exists
   in three Persons, called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These are not
   three persons in the ordinary sense of the word; they are not three
   individuals, but rather three modes or forms in which the Divine Being
   exists. At the same time they are of such a nature that they can enter
   into personal relations. The Father can speak to the Son and vice
   versa, and both can send forth the Spirit. The real mystery of the
   Trinity consists in this that each one of the Persons possesses the
   whole of the divine essence, and that this has no existence outside of
   and apart from the Persons. The three are not subordinate in being the
   one to the other, though it may be said that in order of existence the
   Father is first, the Son second, and the Holy Spirit third, an order
   which is also reflected in their work.

   2. Scripture Proof for the Trinity. The Old Testament contains some
   indications of more than one Person in God. God speaks of Himself in
   the plural, Gen. 1:26; 11:7; the Angel of Jehovah is represented as a
   divine Person, Gen. 16:7-13; 18:1-21; 19:1-22; and the Spirit is spoken
   of as a distinct Person, Isa. 48:16; 63:10. Moreover, there are some
   passages in which the Messiah is speaking and mentions two other
   Persons, Isa. 48:16; 61:6; 63:9, 10.

   Due to the progress of revelation, the New Testament contains clearer
   proofs. The strongest proof is found in the facts of redemption. The
   Father sends the Son into the world, and the Son sends the Holy Spirit.
   Moreover, there are several passages in which the three Persons are
   expressly mentioned, such as the great commission, Matt. 28:19, and the
   apostolic blessing, II Cor. 13:13. Cf. also Luke 3:21, 22; 1:35; I Cor.
   12:4-6; I Pet. 1:2.

   This doctrine was denied by the Socinians in the days of the
   Reformation, and is rejected also by the Unitarians and the Modernists
   of our own day. If they speak of the Trinity at all, they represent it
   as consisting of the Father, the man Jesus, and a divine influence
   which is called the Spirit of God.

   3. The Father. The name 'Father' is frequently applied in Scripture to
   the triune God, as the creator of all things, I Cor. 8:6; Heb. 12:9;
   Jas. 1:17; as the Father of Israel, Deut. 32:6; Isa. 63:16; and as the
   Father of believers, Matt. 5:45; 6:6, 9, 14; Rom. 8:15. In a deeper
   sense, however, it is applied to the First Person of the Trinity, to
   express His relation to the Second Person, John 1:14, 18; 8:54; 14:12,
   13. This is the original Fatherhood, of which all earthly fatherhood is
   but a faint reflection. The distinctive characteristic of the Father is
   that He generates the Son from all eternity. The works particularly
   ascribed to Him are those of planning the work of redemption, creation
   and providence, and representing the Trinity in the Counsel of
   Redemption.

   4. The Son. The second person in the Trinity is called 'Son' or 'Son of
   God.' He bears this name, however, not only as the only begotten of the
   Father, John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; Gal. 4:4, but also as the Messiah
   chosen of God, Matt. 8:29; 26:63; John 1:49; 11:27, and in virtue of
   His special birth through the operation of the Holy Spirit, Luke 1:32,
   35. His special characteristic as the Second Person of the Trinity is
   that He is eternally begotten of the Father, Ps. 2:7; Acts 13:33; Heb.
   1:5. By means of eternal generation the Father is the cause of the
   personal existence of the Son within the Divine Being. The works more
   particularly ascribed to Him are works of mediation. He mediated the
   work of creation, John 1:3, 10; Heb. 1:2, 3, and mediates the work of
   redemption, Eph. 1:3-14.

   5. The Holy Spirit. Though Socinians, Unitarians, and present day
   Modernists speak of the Holy Spirit merely as a power or an influence
   of God, He clearly stands out on the pages of the Bible as a Person,
   John 14:16, 17, 26; 15:26; 16:1-15; Rom. 8:26. He has intelligence,
   John 14:26, feeling, Isa. 68:10; Eph. 4:30, and will, Acts 16:7; I Cor.
   12:11. Scripture represents Him as speaking, searching, testifying,
   commanding, revealing, striving, and making intercession. Moreover, He
   is clearly distinguished from His own power in Luke 1:35; 4:14; Acts
   10:38; I Cor. 2:4. His special characteristic is that He proceeds from
   the Father and the Son by spiration, John 15:26; 16:7; Rom. 8:9; Gal.
   4:6. In general it may be said that it is His task to bring things to
   completion both in creation and redemption, Gen. 1:3; Job 26:13; Luke
   1:35; John 3:34; I Cor. 12:4-11; Eph. 2:22.

   a. The Trinity:
   Isa. 61:1. "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me" (the Messiah),
   cf. Luke 4:17, 18.

   baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Spirit."

   II Cor. 13:14. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
   God; and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."

   b. Eternal generation:
   Ps. 2:7. "I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my
   Son; this day have I begotten Thee."

   John 1:14, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we
   beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full
   of grace and truth."

   e. Procession of the Holy Spirit:
   John 15:26. "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you
   from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
   Father, He shall bear witness of Me."

Chapter VIII: The Divine Decrees

   1. The Divine Decrees in General. The decree of God is His eternal plan
   or purpose, in which He has foreordained all things that come to pass.
   Since it includes many particulars, we often speak of the divine
   decrees in the plural, though in reality there is but a single decree.
   It covers all the works of God in creation and redemption, and also
   embraces the actions of men, not excluding their sinful deeds. But
   while it rendered the entrance of sin into the world certain, it does
   not make God responsible for our sinful deeds. His decree with respect
   to sin is a permissive decree.

   a. Characteristics of the decree. The decree of God is founded in
   wisdom, Eph. 3:9-11, though we do not always understand it. It was
   formed in the depths of eternity, and is therefore eternal in the
   strictest sense of the word, Eph. 3:11. Moreover, it is effectual, so
   that everything that is included in it certainly comes to pass, Isa.
   46:10. The plan of God is also unchangeable, because He is faithful and
   true, Job 28:13, 14; Isa. 46:10; Luke 22:22. It is unconditional, that
   is, its execution does not depend on any action of man but even renders
   such action certain, Acts 2:23; Eph. 2:8. Moreover, it is
   all-inclusive, embracing the good and the wicked actions of men, Eph.
   2:10; Acts 2:28, contingent events, Gen. 50:20, the duration of man's
   life, Job 14:5; Ps. 39:4, and the place of his habitation, Acts 17:26.
   With respect to sin it is permissive.

   b. Objections to the doctrine of the decrees. Many do not believe in
   the doctrine of the decrees, and raise especially three objections. (1)
   It is inconsistent with, the moral freedom of man. But the Bible
   clearly teaches not only that God has decreed the free acts of man, but
   also that man is none to the less free and responsible for his acts,
   Gen. 50:19, 20; Acts 2:23; 4:27-29. We may not be able to harmonize the
   two altogether, but it is evident from Scripture that the one does not
   cancel the other. (2) It makes people slothful in seeking salvation.
   They feel that, if God has determined whether they will be saved or
   not, it makes no difference what they may do. But this is hardly
   correct, because man does not know what God has decreed respecting him.
   Moreover, God has decreed not only the final destiny of man, but also
   the means by which it will be realized. And seeing that the end is
   decreed only as the result of the appointed means, it encourages rather
   than discourages their use. (3) It makes God the author of sin. It may
   be said, however, that the decree merely makes God the author of free
   moral beings, who are themselves the authors of sin. Sin is made
   certain by the decree, but God does not Himself produce it by His
   direct action. At the same time it must be admitted that the problem of
   God's relation to sin remains a mystery which we cannot fully solve.

   2. Predestination. Predestination is the plan or purpose of God
   respecting His moral creatures. It pertains to men, both good and bad,
   to angels and devils, and to Christ as the Mediator. Predestination
   includes two parts, namely, election and reprobation.

   a. Election. The Bible speaks of election in more than one sense, as
   (1) the election of Israel as the Old Testament people of God, Deut.
   4:37; 7:6-8; 10:15; Hos. 13:5; (2) the election of persons to some
   special once or service, Deut. 18:5; I Sam. 10:24; Ps. 78:70; and (3)
   the election of individuals unto salvation, Matt. 22:14; Rom. 11:6;
   Eph. 1:4. The last is the election to which we refer in this
   connection. It may be defined as God's eternal purpose to save some of
   the human race in and by Jesus Czarist.

   b. Reprobation. The doctrine of election naturally implies that God did
   not intend to save all. If He purposed to save some, He naturally also
   purposed not to save others. This is also in harmony with the teachings
   of Scripture, Matt. 11:25, 26; Rom. 9:13, 17, 18, 21, 22; 11:7, 8; II
   Pet. 2:9; Jude 4. Reprobation may be defined as God's eternal purpose
   to pass some men by with the operation of His special grace, and to
   punished them for their sin. It really embodies a twofold purpose
   therefore: (1) to pass some by in the bestowal of saving grace; and (2)
   to punish them for their sins.

   It is sometimes said that the doctrine of predestination exposes God to
   the charge of injustice. But this is hardly correct. We could speak of
   injustice only if man had a claim on God, and God owed man eternal
   salvation. But the situation is entirely different if all men have
   forfeited the blessings of God, as they have. No one has the right to
   call God to account for electing some and rejecting others. He would
   have been perfectly just, if He had not saved any, Matt. 20:14, 15;
   Rom. 9:14, 15.

   To memorize. Passages pertaining to:

   a. God's decree in general:
   Eph. 1:11. "In whom also we were made a heritage, having been
   foreordained according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things
   after the counsel of His will."

   Ps. 33:11. "The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast forever, the thoughts
   of His heart to all generations."

   Isa. 46:10. "Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient
   times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and
   I will do all my pleasure."

   b. Predestination:
   Eph. 1:11, cf. above under a.

   Ps. 2:7. "I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me. Thou art my
   Son; this day have I begotten Thee."

   Eph. 1:4, 5. "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love,
   having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto
   Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."

   Rom. 11:5. "Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
   according to the election of grace."

   Rom. 9:13. "Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."

   Rom. 9:18. "So then He hath mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He
   hardeneth."

   For Further Study.

   a. Is foreknowledge the same as foreordination or predestination? Acts
   2:23; Rom. 8:29; 11:2; I Pet. 1:2.

   b. How does the Bible indicate that Christ was also an object of
   predestination? Ps. 2:7; Isa. 42:1; I Pet. 1:20; 2:4. In what sense is
   this to be understood?

   c. What indications have we that the angels were also objects of
   predestination? I Tim. 5:21. How should we conceive of this?

     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter IX: Creation

   The discussion of the decrees naturally leads on to the study of their
   execution, which begins with the work of creation. This is the
   beginning and basis of all revelation, and also the foundation of all
   religious life.

   1. Creation in General. The word creation is not always used in the
   same sense in the Bible. In the strict sense of the word it denotes
   that work of God by which He producers the world and all that is in it,
   partly without the use of pre-existent materials, and partly out of
   material that is by its nature unfit, for the manifestation of His
   glory. It is represented as a work of the triune God, Gen. 1:2; Job
   26:13; 38:4; Ps. 33:6; Isa. 40:12, 13; John 1:3; I Cor. 8:6; Col.
   1:15-17. Over against Pantheism we must maintain that it was a free act
   of God. He did not need the world. Eph. 1:11; Rev. 4:11. And over
   against Deism, that He created the world so that it always remains
   dependent on Him. He must uphold it from day to day, Acts 17:28; Heb.
   1:3.

   a. The time of creation. The Bible teaches us that God created the
   world "in the beginning," that is, at the beginning of all temporal
   things. Back of this beginning lies a timeless eternity. The first part
   of the work of creation mentioned in Gen. 1:1 was strictly creation out
   of nothing or without the use of preexistent material. The expression
   "creation out of nothing" is not found in the Bible, but in one of the
   apocryphal books, II Mace. 7:28. However, the idea is clearly taught in
   such passages as Gen. 1:1; Ps. 33:9; 148:5; Rom. 4:7; Heb. 11:3.

   b. The final purpose of creation. Some find the final end or purpose of
   creation in the happiness of man. They say that God could not make
   Himself the final end, because He is sufficient unto Himself. But it
   would seem to be self-evident that God does not exist for man, but ma
   for God. The creature cannot be the final end of creation. The Bible
   teaches us clearly that God created the world for the manifestation of
   His glory. Naturally, the revelation of the glory of God is not
   intended as an empty show to be admired by the creature, but also aims
   at promoting their welfare and attuning their hearts to the praise of
   the Creator. Isa. 43:7; 60:21; 61:3; Ezek. 36:21, 22; 39:7; Luke 2:14;
   Rom. 9:17; 11:36; I Cor. 15:28; Eph. 1:5, 6, 12, 14; 8:9, 10; Col.
   1:16.

   c. Substitutes for the doctrine of creation. They who reject the
   doctrine of creation resort to one of three theories for the
   explanation of the world. (1) Some say that original matter is eternal,
   and out of it the world arose, either by mere chance, or by some higher
   directing force. But this is impossible, because you cannot have two
   eternals and therefore two infinites alongside of each other. (2)
   Others maintain that God and the world are essentially one, and that
   the world is a necessary issue (outflow) of the divine being. But this
   view robs God of His power of self-determination, and men of their
   freedom and of their moral and responsible character. It also makes God
   responsible for all the evil there is in the world. (3) Still others
   take refuge in the theory of evolution. But this is clearly a mistake,
   since evolution offers no explanation of the world. It already
   presupposes something that evolves.

   2. The Spiritual World. God created not only a material but also a
   spiritual world, consisting of the angels.

   a. Proof for the existence of angels. Modern liberal theology has
   largely discarded the belief in such spiritual beings. The Bible,
   however, assumes their existence throughout and ascribes to them real
   personality, II Sam. 14:20; Matt. 24:36; Jude 6; Rev. 14:10. Some
   ascribe to them airy bodies, but this is contrary to Scripture. They
   are pure spiritual beings (though sometimes assuming bodily forms),
   Eph. 6:12; Heb. 1:14, without flesh and bone, Luke 24:39, and therefore
   invisible, Col. 1:16. Some of them are good, holy and elect, Mark 8:38;
   Luke 9:26; II Cor. 11:14; I Tim. 5:21; Rev. 14:10, and others are
   fallen from their original state, and therefore evil, John 8:44; II
   Pet. 2:4; Jude 6.

   b. Classes of angels. There are evidently different classes of angels.
   The Bible speaks of cherubim, who reveal the power, majesty, and glory
   of God, and guard His holiness in the garden of Eden, in tabernacle and
   temple, and at the descent of God to the earth. Gen. 3:24; Ex. 25:18;
   II Sam. 22:11; Ps. 18:10; 80:1; 99:1; Isa. 37:16. Alongside of these
   are seraphim, mentioned only in Isa. 6:2, 3, 6. They stand as servants
   round about the throne of the heavenly King, sing His praises, and are
   ever ready to do His bidding. They serve the purpose of reconciliation
   and prepare men for the proper approach to God.

   Two angels are mentioned by name. The first of these is Gabriel, Dan.
   8:16; 9:21; Luke 1:19, 26. Evidently it was his special task to convey
   divine revelations to man and to interpret them. The second is Michael,
   Dan. 10:13, 21; Jude 9; Rev. 12:7. In the Epistle of Jude he is called
   the archangel. He is the valiant warrior fighting the battles of
   Jehovah against the enemies of the people of God and against the evil
   powers in the spirit world. Besides these the Bible mentions in general
   terms principalities, powers, thrones, dominions, Eph. 1:21; 3:10; Col.
   1:16; 2:10; I Pet. 3:22. These names point to differences of rank and
   dignity among the angels.

   c. Work of the angels. The angels are represented as praising God
   continually, Ps. 103:20; Isa. 6; Rev. 5:11. Since the entrance of sin
   into the world they serve those who inherit salvation, Heb. 1:14,
   rejoice at the conversion of sinners, Luke 15:10, watch over believers,
   Ps. 3:7; 91:11, protect the little ones, Matt. 18:10, are present in
   the Church, I Cor. 11:10; Eph. 3:10; I Tim. 5:21, and convey believers
   to the bosom of Abraham, Luke 16:22. They also frequently bear special
   revelations of God, Dan. 9:21-23; Zech. 1:12-14, communicate blessings
   to His people, Ps. 91:11, 12; Isa. 63:9; Dan. 6:22; Acts 5:19, and
   execute judgments on His enemies, Gen. 19:1, 13; II Kings 19:85; Matt.
   18:41.

   d. Evil angels. Besides the good there are also evil angels, who
   delight in opposing God and destroying His work. They were created
   good, but did not retain their original position, II Pet. 2:4; Jude 6.
   Their special sin is not revealed, but they probably revolted against
   God and aspired to divine authority, cf. II Thess. 2:4, 9. Satan, who
   was evidently one of the princes among the angels, became the
   recognized head of those that fell away, Matt. 26:41; 9:34; Eph. 2:2.
   With superhuman power he and his hosts seek to destroy the work of God.
   They seek to blind and mislead even the elect, and encourage the sinner
   in his evil way.

   3. The Material World. In Gen. 1:1 we have the record of the original
   creation of heaven and earth. The rest of the chapter is devoted to
   what is often called secondary creation, the completion of the work in
   six days.

   a. The days of creation. The question is frequently debated, whether
   the days of creation were ordinary days or not. Geologists and
   evolutionists speak of them as long periods of time. Now the word 'day'
   does not always denote a period of twenty-four hours in the Scripture.
   Cf. Gen 1:5; 2:4; Ps. 50:16; Eccl. 7:14; Zech. 4:10. Yet the literal
   interpretation of the word 'day' in the narrative of creation is
   favored by the following considerations:

   (a) The Hebrew word yom (day) primarily denotes an ordinary day, and
   should be so understood unless the context demands another
   interpretation. (b) The repeated mention of morning and evening favors
   this interpretation. (c) It was evidently an ordinary day which Jehovah
   set aside and hallowed as a day of rest. (d) In Ex. 20:9-11 Israel is
   commanded to labor six days and to rest on the seventh, because Jehovah
   made heaven and earth in six days and rested on the seventh day. (e)
   The last three days were evidently ordinary days, for they were
   determined by the earth's relation to the sun. And if they were
   ordinary days, why not the others?

   b. Work of the six days. On the first day light was created, and by the
   separation of light and darkness day and night were constituted. This
   does not conflict with the idea that sun, moon, and stars were created
   on the fourth day, for these are not themselves light, but
   light-bearers. The work of the second day was also a work of
   separation, the separation of the waters above from the waters below by
   the establishment of the firmament. On the third day the work of
   separation is continued in the separation of the sea and the dry land.
   In addition to that the vegetable kingdom of plants and trees was
   established. By the word of His power God caused the earth to bring
   forth flowerless plants, vegetables, and fruit trees, each yielding
   seed after their kind. The fourth day brought the creation of sun,
   moon, and stars, to serve a variety of purposes: to divide day and
   night, to serve as signs of weather conditions, to determine the
   succession of the seasons and of days and years, and to function as
   lights for the earth. The work of the fifth day consisted in the
   creation of birds and fishes, the inhabitants of the air and of the
   water. Finally, the sixth day is marked by the climax of the work of
   creation. The higher classes of land animals were created, and the
   whole work was crowned by the creation of man in the image of God. His
   body was formed out of the dust of the earth, while his soul was an
   immediate creation of God. On the seventh day God rested from His
   creative labors and delighted in the contemplation of His work. c. The
   theory of evolution. Evolutionists want to substitute their view of the
   origin of things for the Scriptural doctrine. They believe that from
   the simplest forms of matter and life all existing species of plants
   and animals (including man), and also the various manifestations of
   life, such an intelligence, morality, and religion, developed by a
   perfectly natural process, purely as the result of natural forces. This
   is merely an assumption, however, and one that fails at several points.
   Moreover, it is in hopeless conflict with the narrative of creation as
   it is found in the Bible.

Chapter X: Providence

   Since God not only created the world but also upholds it, we naturally
   pass from the doctrine of creation to that of divine providence. This
   may be defined as that work of God in which He preserves all His
   creatures, is active in all that happens in the world, and directs all
   things to their appointed end. It includes three elements, of which the
   first pertains primarily to the being, the second to the activity, and
   the third to the purpose of all things.

   1. The Elements of Divine Providence. We distinguish three elements:

   a. Divine preservation. This is that continuous work of God by which He
   upholds all things. While the world has a distinct existence and is not
   a part of God, it nevertheless has the ground of its continued
   existence in God and not in itself. It endures through a continued
   exercise of divine power by which all things are maintained in being
   and action. This doctrine is taught in the following passages: Ps.
   136:25; 145:15; Neh. 9:6; Acts 17:28; Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3.

   b. Divine concurrence. This may be defined as that work of God by which
   He co-operates with all His creatures and causes them to act precisely
   as they do. It implies that there are real secondary causes in the
   world, such as the powers of nature and the will of man, and asserts
   that these do not work independently of God. God works in every act of
   His creatures, not only in their good but also in their evil acts. He
   stimulates them to action, accompanies their action at every moment,
   and makes this action effective. However, we should never think of God
   and man as equal causes; the former is the primary, and the latter only
   a secondary cause. Neither should we conceive of them as each doing a
   part of the work like a team of horses. The same deed is in its
   entirety both a deed of God and a deed of man. Moreover, we should
   guard against the idea that this co-operation makes God responsible for
   man's sinful deeds. This doctrine is based on Scripture, Deut. 8:18;
   Ps. 104:20, 21, 30; Amos 3:6; Matt. 6:45; 10:29; Acts 14:17; Phil.
   2:13.

   c. Divine government. This is the continued activity of God whereby He
   rules all things so that they answer to the purpose of their existence.
   God is represented as King of the universe both in the Old and in the
   New Testament. He adapts His rule to the nature of the creatures which
   He governs; His government of the physical world differs from that of
   the spiritual world. It is universal, Ps. 103:19; Dan, 4:34, 35,
   includes the most insignificant things, Matt. 10:29-31, and that which
   is seemingly accidental, Prov. 16:33, and bears on both the good and
   the evil deeds of man, Phil. 2:18; Gen. 50:20; Acts 14:16.

   2. Misconceptions of Divine Providence. In the doctrine of providence
   we should guard against two misconceptions:

   a. The Deistic conception. This is to the effect that God's concern
   with the world is of the most general nature. He created the world,
   established its laws, set it in motion, and then withdrew from it. He
   wound it up like a clock, and now lets it run off. It is only when
   something goes wrong that He interferes with its regular operation.
   God, is only a God afar off.

   b. The Pantheistic conception. Pantheism does not recognize the
   distinction between God and the world. It identifies the two, and
   therefore leaves no room for providence in the proper sense of the
   word. There are, strictly speaking, no such things as secondary causes.
   God is the direct author of all that transpires in the world. Even the
   acts which we ascribe to man as really acts of God. God is only a God
   that is near, and not a God afar off.

   3. Extraordinary Providences or Miracles. We distinguish between
   general and special providences, and among the latter the miracles
   occupy an important place. A miracle is a supernatural work of God,
   that is a work which is accomplished without the mediation of secondary
   causes. If God sometimes apparently uses secondary causes in the
   production of miracles, He employs them in an unusual way, so that the
   work Is after all supernatural. Some regard miracles as impossible,
   because they involve a violation of the laws of nature. But this is a
   mistake. The so-called laws of nature merely represent God's usual
   method of working. And the fact that God generally works according to a
   definite order does not mean that He cannot depart from this order, and
   cannot without violating or disturbing it bring about unusual results.
   Even man can lift up his hand and throw a ball into the air in spite of
   the law of gravitation and without in any way disturbing its operation.
   Surely, this is not impossible for the omnipotent God. The miracles of
   the Bible are means of revelation. Num. 16:28; Jer. 32:20; John 2:11;
   5:36.

   To memorize. Passages referring to:

   a. Preservation:
   Ps. 36:6b. " Jehovah, thou preservest man and beast."

   Neh. 9:6. "Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven,
   the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things
   that are thereon, the seas all that is in them, and thou preservest
   them all."

   Col. 1:17. "And He is before all things, and in Him all things
   consist."

   b. Concurrence.

   Deut. 8:18a. "But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is He
   that giveth thee power to get wealth."

   Amos 3:6. "Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people be not
   afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?"

   Phil. 2:13. "For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work,
   for His good pleasure."

   c. Government.
   Ps. 108:19. "Jehovah hath established His throne in the heavens; and
   His Kingdom ruleth over all."

   Dan. 4:3b. "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is
   from generation to generation."

   I Tim. 6:15. "Which in its own times He shall show, who is the blessed
   and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords."

   d. Miracles and their design:

   Ex. 16:11. "Who is like unto Thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like
   Thee glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"

   Ps. 72:18. "Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone doeth
   wondrous things."

   Mark 2:10. "But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on
   earth to forgive sins, He saith to the sick of the palsy, I say unto
   thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy wan into thy house."

   John 2:11. "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,
   and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him."

   For Further Study:
   a. Name some examples of special providences. Cf. Deut. 2:7; I Kings
   17:6, 16; II Kings 4:6; Matt. 14:20.

   b. How should belief in divine providence affect our cares? Isa. 41:10;
   Matt. 6:32; Luke 12:7; Phil. 4:6, 7; I Pet. 5:7.

   c. Name some of the blessings of providence. Cf. Isa. 25:4; Ps. 121:4;
   Luke 12:7; Deut. 33:28; Ps. 37:28; II Tim. 4:18.

Man in Relation to God
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XI: Man in His Original State

   From the discussion of the doctrine of God we pass on to that of man,
   the crown of God's handiwork.

   1. The Essential Elements of Human Nature. The usual view is that man
   consists of two parts, body and soul. This is in harmony with the
   self-consciousness of man, and is also borne out by a study of
   Scripture, which speaks of man as consisting of "body and soul," Matt.
   6:25; 10:28, or of "body and spirit," Eccl. 12:7; I Cor. 5:3,5. Some
   are of the opinion that the words 'soul' and 'spirit' denote different
   elements, and that therefore man consists of three parts, body, soul,
   and spirit, Cf. I Thess. 5:23. It is evident, however, that the two
   words 'soul' and 'spirit' are used interchangeably. Death is sometimes
   described as a giving up of the soul, Gen. 35:18; I Kings 17:21, and
   sometimes as the giving up of the spirit, Luke 23:46; Acts 7:59. The
   dead are in some cases named "souls," Rev. 9:6; 20:4, and in others
   'spirits,' I Pet 3:19; Heb. 12:23. The two terms denote the spiritual
   element in man from different points of view. As spirit it is the
   principle of life and action, which controls the body, and as soul it
   is the personal subject, which thinks and feels and wills, and in some
   cases the seat of the affections.

   2. The Origin of the Soul in Each Individual. There are three views
   respecting the origin of the individual souls.

   a. Pre-existentialism. Some advocated the idea that the souls of men
   existed in a previous state, and that something that happened then
   accounts for their present condition. A few found in this an
   explanation of the fact that man is born as a sinner. This view finds
   no favor now.

   b. Traducianism. According to this View men derive their souls as well
   as their bodies from their parents. This is the common view in the
   Lutheran Church. Support for it is found in the fact that nothing is
   said about the creation of Eve's soul, and that descendants are said to
   be in the loins of their Fathers, Gen. 46:26; Heb. 7:9, 10.
   Furthermore, it seems to be favored by the fact that in the case of
   animals both body and soul are passed on from the old to the young, by
   the inheritance of family traits and peculiarities, and by the
   inheritance of sinful corruption, which is a matter of the soul more
   than of the body. However, it is burdened with serious difficulties. It
   either makes the parents creators, or assumes that the soul of man can
   be divided into various parts. Moreover, it endangers the sinlessness
   of Jesus.

   c. Creationism. This holds that each soul is a direct creation of God,
   of which the time cannot be precisely determined. The soul is supposed
   to be created pure, but to become sinful even before birth by entering
   into that complex of sin by which humanity as a whole is burdened. This
   view is common in Reformed circles. It is favored by the fact that
   Scripture represents the body and the soul of man as having different
   origins, Eccl. 12:7; Isa. 42:5; Zech. 12:1; Heb. 12:9. Moreover, it is
   more in harmony with the spiritual nature of the soul, and safeguards
   the sinlessness of Jesus. It is not free from difficulties, however. It
   does not explain the inheritance of family traits, and may seem to make
   God the Creator of sinful souls.

   3. Man as the Image of God. The Bible teaches that man is created in
   the image of God. According to Gen. 1:26, God said, "Let us make man in
   our image, after our likeness." The two words 'image' and 'likeness'
   evidently denote the same thing. The following passages show that they
   are used interchangeably: Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:1; 9:6; I Cor. 11:7; Col.
   3:10; Jas. 3:9. The word 'likeness' probably stresses the fact that the
   image is most like or very similar. There are different views of the
   image of God in man:

   a. The Roman Catholic view:. Roman Catholics find the image of God in
   certain natural gifts with which man is endowed, such as the
   spirituality of the soul, the freedom of the will, and immortality. To
   these God added a supernatural gift, called original righteousness, to
   keep the lower nature in check. This is supposed to constitute man's
   likeness to God.

   b. The Lutheran view. The Lutherans are not all agreed on this point,
   but the prevailing opinion is that the image of God consists only in
   those spiritual qualities with which man was endowed at creation,
   namely, true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. These may be
   designated original righteousness. This view is too restricted.

   c. The Reformed view. The Reformed distinguish between the natural and
   the moral image of God. The former is the broader of the two, and is
   generally said to consist in man's spiritual, rational, moral, and
   immortal being. This was obscured but not lost by sin. The latter is
   the image of God in the more restricted sense, and consists in true
   knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. This was lost by sin and is
   restored in Christ, Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10. Since man retained the image
   in the broader sense, he can still be called the image or image-bearer
   of God, Gen. 9:6; I Cor. 11:7; 15:49; Jas 3:9.

   4. Man in the Covenant of Works. God at once entered into covenant
   relationship with man. This original covenant is called the covenant of
   works.

   a. Scripture proof for the covenant of works. (1) Paul draws a parallel
   between Adam and Christ in Rom. 5:12-21. In Adam all men died, but in
   Christ all those who are His are made alive. This means that Adam was
   the representative head of all men, just as Christ is now the
   representative head of all those who are His. (2) In Hos. 6:7 we read:
   "But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant" (Am. Rev.). Adam's
   sin is called a transgression of the covenant.

   b. The elements of the covenant of works. (1) The parties. A covenant
   is always a compact between two parties. In this case they are the
   triune God, the sovereign Lord of the universe, and Adam as the
   representative of the human race. Since these parties are very unequal,
   the covenant naturally partakes of the nature of an arrangement imposed
   on man. (2) The promise. The promise of the covenant was the promise of
   life in the highest sense, life raised above the possibility of death.
   This is what believers now receive through Christ, the last Adam. (3)
   The condition. The condition was that of absolute obedience. The
   positive command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and
   evil was clearly a test of pure obedience. (4) The penalty. The penalty
   was death in the most inclusive sense of the word, physical, spiritual,
   and eternal. This consists not only in the separation of body and soul,
   but more fundamentally in the separation of the soul from God. (5) The
   sacrament(s). In all probability the tree of life was the only
   sacrament of this covenant,-- if it was indeed a sacrament. It seems to
   have been appointed as a symbol and seal of life.

   c. The present validity of the covenant of works. Arminians hold that
   this covenant was wholly set aside. But this is not correct. The demand
   of perfect obedience still stands for those who do not accept the
   righteousness of Christ. Lev. 18:5; Gal. 3:12. Though they cannot meet
   the requirement, the condition stands. It holds no more, however, for
   those who are in Christ, since He met the demands of the law for them.
   It ceased to be a way of life, for as such it is powerless after the
   fall.

   To memorize. Passages bearing on:

   a. The elements of human nature:
   Matt. 10:28. "And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not
   able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both
   body and soul in hell."

   Rom. 8:10. "And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin;
   but the spirit is life because of righteousness."

   b. The creation of the soul:
   Eccl. 12:7. "And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the
   spirit returneth unto God who gave it."

   Heb. 12:9. "Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us,
   and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection
   to the Father of spirits, and live?"

   c. Man's creation in the image of God:
   Gen. 1:27. "And God created man in His own image, in the image of God
   created He him; male and female created He them."

   Gen. 9:6. "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed;
   for in the image of God made He man."

   d. Man in general even now tie image of God:
   Gen. 9:6. Cf. above under c.

   Jas. 3:9. "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse
   we men, who are made in the likeness of God."

   e. The restoration of the image of God in man:
   Eph. 4:24. "And put on the new man, that after God hath been created in
   righteousness and holiness of truth."

   Col. 3:10. "And have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto
   knowledge after the image of Him that created him."

   f. The covenant of works:
   Hos. 6:7. "But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant."

   I Cor. 16:22. "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be
   made alive."

   For Further Study:

   a. How would you explain the passages which seem to imply that man
   consists of three elements, I Thess. 6:23; Heb. 4:12; compare Matt.
   22:37.

   b. Does man's dominion over the rest of creation also form part of the
   image of God? Gen. 1:26, 28; Ps. 8:6-8; Heb. 2:5-9.

   c. What indications of a covenant can you find in Gen. 2 and 3?

   this be proved?

   2. What other view is there, and what passages seem to support it?

   3. What different views are there as to the origin of the soul?

Chapter XII: Man in the State of Sin

   1. The Origin of Sin. The Bible teaches us that sin entered the world
   as the result of the transgression of Adam and Eve in paradise. The
   first sin was occasioned by the temptation of Satan in the form of a
   serpent, who sowed in man's heart the seeds of distrust and unbelief.
   Scripture clearly indicates that the serpent, who appears as the
   tempter in the story of the fall, was but an instrument of Satan, John
   8:44; Rom. 16:20; II Cor. 11:3; Rev. 12:9. The first sin consisted in
   man's eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This eating
   was sinful simply because God had forbidden it. It clearly showed that
   man was not willing to subject his will unconditionally to the will of
   God, and comprised several elements. In the intellect it revealed
   itself as unbelief and pride, in the will as the desire to be like God,
   and in the affections an unholy satisfaction in eating of the forbidden
   fruit. As a result of it man lost the image of God in the restricts
   sense, became guilty and utterly corrupt, and fell under the sway of
   death, Gen. 3:19; Rom. 5:12; 6:23.

   2. The Essential Nature of Sin. At present many substitute the word
   'evil' for 'sin,' but this is a poor substitute, for the word 'sin' is
   far more specific. It denotes a kind of evil, namely, a moral evil for
   which man is responsible and which brings him under a sentence of
   condemnation. The modern tendency is to regard it merely as a wrong
   done to one's fellow-beings misses the point entirely, for such a wrong
   can be called sin only in so far as it is contrary to the will of God.
   Sin is correctly defined by Scripture as "lawlessness," I John 3:4. It
   is lack of conformity to the law of God, and as such the opposite of
   that love which is required by the divine law. The Bible always
   contemplates it in relation to the law, Rom. 1:32; 2:12-14; 4:15; 5:13;
   Jas. 2:9, 10; I John 3:4. It is first of all guilt, making men liable
   to punishment, Rom. 3:19; 5:18; Eph. 2:8, and then also inherent
   corruption or moral pollution. All men are guilty in Adam, and are
   therefore born with a corrupt nature. Job 14:4; Jer. 17:9; Isa. 6:5;
   Rom. 8:5-8; Eph. 4:17-19. Sin has its seat in the heart of man, and
   from this center influences the intellect, the will, and the
   affections, in fact the whole man, and finds expression through the
   body. Prov. 4:23; Jer. 17:9; Matt. 15:19, 20; Luke 6:45; Heb. 3:12. In
   distinction from the Roman Catholics we maintain that it does not
   consist in outward acts only, but includes evil thoughts, affections,
   and intents of the heart. Matt. 5:22, 28; Rom. 7:7; Gal. 5:17, 24.

   3. Sin in the Life of the Human Race. Three points deserve
   consideration here:

   a. The connection between Adam's sin and that of his descendants. This
   has been explained in three different ways. (1) The earliest
   explanation is called the realistic theory, which is to the effect that
   God originally created one general human nature, which in course of
   time divided into as many parts as there are human individuals. Adam
   possessed the whole of this general human nature; and through his sin
   it became guilty and polluted. Naturally, every individual part of it
   shares this guilt and pollution. (2) In the days of the Reformation the
   representative theory came to the foreground. According to this view
   Adam stood in a twofold relation to his descendants: he was their
   natural head, and he was their representative as the head of the
   covenant. When he sinned as their representative, this sin was also
   imputed to them, and as a result they are all born in a corrupt state.
   This is our Reformed view. (3) A third theory, not as well known, is
   that of mediate imputation. It holds that the guilt of Adam's sin is
   not directly placed to our account. His corruption is passed on to his
   descendants, and this makes them personally guilty. They are not
   corrupt because they are guilty in Adam, but guilty because they are
   corrupt.

   b. Original and Actual Sin. We distinguish between original and actual
   sin. All men are born in a sinful state and condition, which is called
   original sin, and is the root of all the actual sins that are
   committed. (1) Original sin. This includes both guilt and pollution.
   The guilt of Adam's sin is imputed to us. Because he sinned as our
   representative, we are guilty in him. Moreover, we also inherit his
   pollution, and now have a positive disposition toward sin. Man is by
   nature totally depraved. This does not mean that every man is as bad as
   he can be, but that sin has corrupted every part of his nature and
   rendered him unable to do any spiritual good. He may still do many
   praiseworthy things in relation to his fellow-beings, but even his best
   works are radically defective, because they are not prompted by love to
   God nor done in obedience to God. This total depravity and inability is
   denied by Pelagians, Arminians, and Modernists, but is clearly taught
   in Scripture, Jer. 17:9; John 5:42; 6:44; 15:4, 5; Rom. 7:18, 23, 24;
   8:7, 8; I Cor. 2:14; II Cor. 7:1; Eph. 2:1-3; 4:18; II Tim. 3:2-4; Tit.
   1:16; Heb. 11:6. (2) Actual sin. The term 'actual sin' denotes not only
   sins consisting in outward acts, but also those conscious thoughts,
   desires, and decisions that proceed from original sin. They are the
   sins which the individual performs in distinction from his inherited
   nature and inclination. While original sin is one, actual sins are
   manifold. They may be sins of the inner life, such as pride, envy,
   hatred, sensual lusts, and evil desires; or sins of the outer life,
   such as deceit, theft, murder, adultery, and so on. Among these there
   is one unpardonable sin, namely, the sin of blasphemy against the Holy
   Spirit, after which a change of heart is impossible, and for which it
   is not necessary to pray, Matt, 12:31, 32; Mark 3:28-30; Luke 12:10;
   Heb. 6:4-6; 10:26, 27; I John 5:16.

   c. The Universality of Sin. Scripture and experience both teach us that
   sin is universal. Even the Pelagians do not deny this, though they
   ascribe it to external conditions, such as a bad environment, evil
   examples, and s wrong kind of education.

   There are passages in which the Bible directly asserts the universality
   of sin, such as I Kings 8:46; Ps. 143: 2; Prov. 20:9; Eccl. 7:20; Rom.
   3:1-12, 19, 23; Gal 3:22; Jas. 3:2; I John 1:8, 10. Moreover, it
   teaches that man is sinful from birth, so that this cannot be
   considered as the result of imitation, Job 14:4; Ps. 51:5; John 3:6.
   Even infants are considered sinful, for they are subject to death,
   which is the penalty for sin, Rom. 5:12-14. All men are by nature under
   condemnation, and therefore need the redemption which is in Christ
   Jesus. Children are never made an exception to this rule. John 3:3, 5;
   Eph. 2:3; I John 5:12.

   To memorize. Passages to prove:

   a. That sin is guilt:
   Rom. 5:18. "So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all
   men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free
   gift came unto all men to justification of life."

   I John 3:4. "Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin
   is lawlessness."

   Eph. 2:3. "Among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh,
   doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
   children of wrath, even as the rest."

   b. That sin is pollution:
   Jer. 17:9. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is
   exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?"

   Rom. 7:18, "For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no
   good thing; for to will is present with me, but to do that which is
   good is not."

   Rom. 8:6. "For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the
   flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."

   c. That sin has its seat in the heart:
   Jer. 17:9. Cf. above under b.

   Matt. 16:19. "For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts murders,
   adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings."

   Heb. 3:12. "Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one
   of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God."

   d. That Adam's guilt is imputed to us:
   Rom. 5:12. "Through one man sin entered into the world, and death
   through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned."
   Also verse 19. "For as through one man's disobedience the many were
   made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many
   be made righteous."

   I Cor. 15:21, 22. "For since by man came death, by man came also the
   resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ
   shall all be made alive."

   e. That man is totally depraved:
   Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:18; 8:5. Cf. under b. above.

   g. That sin is universal:
   I Kings 8:46. "For there is no man that sinneth not."

   Ps. 143:2. "And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy
   sight no living man is righteous."

   Rom. 3:12. "They have all turned aside, they are become unprofitable;
   there is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one."

   I John 1:8. "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
   the truth is not in us."

   For Further Study:

   a. Can you give some other scriptural names for sin? Job 15:5; 33:9;
   Ps. 32:1, 2; 55:15; Rom. 1:18; 5:15; I John 3:4.

   b. Does the word 'evil' ever mean anything else than sin in Scripture?
   If so, what? Cf. Ex. 5:19; II Kings 6:33; 22:16; Ps. 41:8; 91:10; Prov.
   16:4.

   c. Does the Bible explicitly teach that man is a sinner from birth? Ps.
   51:5; Isa. 48:8.

Chapter XIII: Man in the Covenant of Grace

   For the sake of clearness we distinguish between the covenant of
   redemption and the covenant of grace. The two are so closely related
   that they can be and sometimes are, considered as one. The former is
   the eternal foundation of the latter.

   1. The Covenant of Redemption. This is also called "the counsel of
   peace," a name derived from Zech. 6:13. It is a covenant between the
   Father, representing the Trinity, and the Son as the representative of
   the elect.

   a. The scriptural basis for it. It is clear that the plan of redemption
   was included in God's eternal decree, Eph. 1:4 ff.; 3:11; II Tim. 1:9.
   Christ speaks of promises made to Him before He came into the world,
   and repeatedly refers to a commission which He received from the
   Father, John 5:30, 43; 6:38-40; 17:4-12. He is evidently a covenant
   head, Rom. 5:12-21; I Cor. 15: -- 22. In Ps. 2:7-9 the parties of the
   covenant are mentioned and a promise is indicated, and in Ps. 40:7, 8
   the Messiah expresses His readiness to do the Father's will in becoming
   a sacrifice for sin.

   b. The Son in the covenant of redemption. Christ is not only the Head
   but also the Surety of the covenant of redemption, Heb. 7:22, A surety
   is one who takes upon himself the legal obligations of another. Christ
   took the place of the sinner, to bear the penalty of sin and to meet
   the demands of the law for His people. By so doing He became the last
   Adam, a life-giving spirit, I Cor. 15:45. For Christ this covenant was
   a covenant of works, in which He met the requirements of the original
   covenant, but for us it is the eternal foundation of the covenant of
   grace. Its benefits are limited to the elect. They only obtain the
   redemption and inherit the glory which Christ merited for sinners.

   c. Requirements and promises in the covenant of redemption. (1) The
   Father required of the Son that He should assume human nature with its
   present infirmities, though without sin, Gal. 4:4, 5; Heb. 2:10, 11,
   14, 15; 4:15; that He should place Himself under the law to pay the
   penalty and to merit eternal life for the elect, Ps. 40:8; John 10:11;
   Gal. 1:4; 4:4, 5; and that He should apply His merits to His people by
   the renewing operation of the Holy Spirit, thus securing the
   consecration of their lives to God, John 10:28; 17:19-22; Heb. 5:7-9.
   (2) And the Father promised the Son that He would prepare for Him a
   body, Heb. 10:5, would anoint Him with the Holy Spirit, Isa. 42:1;
   61:1; John 3:34, would support Him in His work, Isa. 42:6, 7; Luke
   22:43 would deliver Him from the power of death and place Him at His
   own right hand, Ps. 16:8-11; Phil. 2:9-11, would enable Him to [s]end
   the Spirit for the formation of the Church, John 14:26; 15:26; 16:13,
   14, would draw and preserve the elect, John 6:37, 39, 40, 44, 45, and
   would grant Him a numerous seed, Ps. 22:27; 72:17

   2. The Covenant of Grace. On the basis of the covenant of redemption
   God established the covenant of grace. Several particulars call for
   consideration here.

   a. The contracting parties. God is the first party in the covenant. He
   establishes the covenant and determines the relation in which the
   second party will stand to Him. It is not so easy to determine who the
   second party is. The prevailing opinion in Reformed circles is that it
   is the elect sinner in Christ. We should bear in mind, however, that
   the covenant may be viewed in two different ways: (1) As an end in
   itself, a covenant of mutual friendship or communion of life, which is
   realized in the course of history through the operation of the Holy
   Spirit. It represents a condition in which privileges are improved for
   spiritual ends, the promises of God are embraced by a living faith, and
   the promised blessings are fully realized. So conceived, it may be
   defined as that gracious agreement between God and the elect sinner in
   Christ, in which God gives Himself with all the blessings of salvation
   to the elect sinner, and the latter embraces God and all His gracious
   gifts by faith. Deut. 7:9; II Chron. 6:14; Ps. 25:10, 14; 103:17, 18.
   (2) As a means to an end, a purely legal arrangement for the
   realization of a spiritual end. It is evident that the Bible sometimes
   speaks of the covenant as including some in whom the promises are never
   realized, such as Ishmael, Esau, the wicked sons of Eli, and the
   rebellious Israelites who died in their sins. The covenant may be
   regarded as a purely legal agreement, in which God guarantees the
   blessings of salvation to all who believe. If we think of the covenant
   in this broader sense, we can say that God established it with
   believers and their children, Gen. 17:7; Acts 2:39; Rom. 9:1-4.

   b. The promises and requirements of the covenant. Every covenant has
   two sides; it offers certain privileges and imposes certain
   obligations.

   (1) The promises of the covenant. The main promise of the covenant,
   which includes all others, is contained in the oftrepeated words, "I
   will be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee," Jer. 31:33;
   32:38-40; Ezek. 34:23-25, 30, 31; 36:25-28; Heb. 8:10; II Cor. 6:16-18.
   This promise includes all others, such as the promise of temporal
   blessings, of justification, of the Spirit of God, and of final
   glorification in a life that never ends. Job 19:25-27; Ps. 16:11;
   73:24-26; Isa. 43:25; Jer. 31:33, 34; Ezek. 36:27; Dan. 12:2, 3; Gal.
   4:4, 5, 6; Tit, 3:7; Heb. 11:7; Jas. 2:5.

   (2) The requirements of the covenant. The covenant of grace is not a
   covenant of works; it requires no work with a view to merit. However,
   it does contain requirements and imposes obligations on man. By meeting
   the demands of the covenant man earns nothing, but merely puts himself
   in the way in which God will communicate to him the promised blessings.
   Moreover, it should be borne in mind that even the requirements are
   covered by the promises: God gives man all that He requires of him. The
   two things which He demands of those who stand in covenant relationship
   to Him are (a) that they accept the covenant and the covenant promises
   by faith, and thus enter upon the life of the covenant; and (b) that
   from the principle of the new life born within them, they consecrate
   themselves to God in new obedience.

   c. The characteristics of the covenant. The covenant of grace is a
   gracious covenant, because it is a fruit and manifestation of the grace
   of God to sinners. It is grace from start to finish. It is also an
   eternal and inviolable covenant, to which God will always be true,
   though men may break it. Even in its widest extent it includes only a
   part of mankind, and is therefore particular. If its New Testament
   dispensation is called universal, this is done only in view of the fact
   that it is not limited to the Jews, as the Old Testament dispensation
   was. This covenant is also characterized by unity. It is essentially
   the same in all dispensations, though the form of its administration
   changes. The essential promise is the same, Gen. 17:7; Heb. 8:10, the
   gospel is the same, Gal. 3:8, the requirement of faith is the same,
   Gal. 3:6, 7, and the Mediator is the same, Heb. 13:8. The covenant is
   both conditional and unconditional. It is conditional because it is
   dependent on the merits of Christ and because the enjoyment of the life
   it offers depends on the exercise of faith. But it is unconditional in
   the sense that it does not depend on any merits of man. And, finally,
   it is testamentary as a free and sovereign disposition on the part of
   God. It is called a 'testament' in Heb. 9:16, 17. This name stresses
   the facts, (1) that it is a free arrangement of God; (2) that its New
   Testament dispensation was ushered in by the death of Christ; and (3)
   that in it God gives what He demands. The covenant of grace differs
   from the covenant of works in that it has a mediator. Christ is
   represented as the Mediator of the new covenant, I Tim. 2:5; Heb. 8:6;
   9:15; 12:24. He is Mediator, not only merely in the sense that He
   intervenes between God and man to sue for peace and to persuade to it,
   but in the sense that He is armed with full power to do all that is
   necessary for the actual establishment of peace. As our Surety, Heb.
   7:22, He assumes our guilt, pays the penalty of sin, fulfills the law,
   and thus restores peace.

   d. Membership in the covenant. Adults can enter the covenant as a
   purely legal arrangement only by faith. And when they so enter it, they
   at the same time gain entrance into the covenant as a communion of
   life. They therefore enter upon the full covenant life at once.
   Children of believers, however, enter the covenant as a legal
   arrangement by birth, but this does not necessarily mean that they also
   at once enter it as a communion of life, nor even that they will ever
   enter it in that sense. Yet the promise of God gives a reasonable
   assurance that the covenant life will be realized in them. As long as
   they do not manifest the contrary we may proceed on the assumption that
   they possess the new life. When they grow up, they must accept their
   covenant responsibilities voluntarily by a true confession of faith.
   Failure to do this makes them covenant breakers. From the preceding it
   follows that unregenerate persons may temporarily be in the covenant as
   a purely legal relationship, Rom. 9:4. They are recognized as covenant
   children, are subject to its requirements and share its ministrations.
   They receive the seal of baptism, enjoy the common blessings of the
   covenant, and may even partake of some special operations of the Holy
   Spirit. If they do not accept the corresponding responsibilities, they
   will be judged as breakers of the covenant. The different dispensations
   of the covenant. (1) The first revelation of the covenant is found in
   Gen. 3:15, which is usually called the protevangel or the maternal
   promise. This does not yet refer to the formal establishment of the
   covenant. (2) The covenant with Noah is of a very general nature as a
   covenant with all flesh. It conveys only natural blessings, and is
   therefore often called the covenant of nature or of common grace. It is
   closeconnected, however, with the covenant of grace. It is also a fruit
   of the grace of God and guarantees those natural and temporal blessings
   which are absolutely necessary for the realization of the covenant of
   grace. (3) The covenant with Abraham marks its formal establishment. It
   is the beginning of the Old Testament particularistic administration of
   the covenant, which is now limited to Abraham and his descendants,
   Faith stands out prominently as its necessary requirement, and
   circumcision becomes its seal. (4) The covenant at Sinai is essentially
   the same as that established with Abraham, but now takes in the whole
   nation of Israel, and thus became a national covenant. Though it
   strongly stresses the keeping of the law, it should not be regarded as
   a renewed covenant of works. The law increased the consciousness of
   sin, Rom. 3:20, and became a tutor unto Christ, Gal. 3:24. Passover was
   added as a second sacrament. (5) The new covenant, as revealed in the
   New Testament, Jer. 31:31; Heb. 8:8, 13, is essentially the same as
   that of the Old Testament, Rom. 4; Gal. 3. It now breaks through the
   barriers of particularism and becomes universal in the sense that its
   blessings are extended to people of all nations. Its blessings become
   fuller and more spiritual, and baptism and the Lord's Supper are
   substituted for the Old Testament sacraments.

   that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
   which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith
   Jehovah. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of

   inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their
   God, and they shall be my people."

Chapter XIV: The Names and Nature of Christ

   1.The Names of Christ. The most important names of Christ are the
   following: a. Jesus. This is the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua, Jos.
   1:1; Zech. 3:1, or Jeshua, Ezra 2:2. Derived from the Hebrew word 'to
   save,' it designates Christ as the Saviour, Matt. 1:21. Two types of
   Christ bore the same name in the Old Testament, namely, Joshua the son
   of Nun and Joshua the son of Jehozadak.

   b. Christ. This is the New Testament form for the Old Testament
   'Messiah,' which means 'the anointed one.' According to the Old
   Testament, prophets, I Kings 19:16, priests, Ex. 29:7, and kings, I
   Sam..10:1, were anointed with oil, which symbolized the Holy By this
   anointing they were set aside for their respective offices, and were
   qualified for them. Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit for the
   threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. Historically, this
   anointing took place when He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and when
   He was baptized.

   c. Son of Man. This name, as applied to Christ, was derived from Dan.
   7:13. It is the name which Jesus generally applies to Himself, while
   others seldom use it. While it does contain an indication of the
   humanity of Jesus, in the light of its historical origin in points far
   more to His superhuman character and to His future coming with the
   clouds of heaven in majesty and glory, Dan. 7:13; Matt. 16:27, 28;
   26:64; Luke 21:27.

   d. Son of God. Christ is called 'the Son of God' in more than one
   sense. He is so called, because He is the second Person of the Trinity,
   and therefore Himself God, Matt. 11:27, but also because He is the
   appointed Messiah, Matt. 24:36, and because His birth to the
   supernatural activity of the Holy Spirit, Luke 1:3.

   e. Lord. Jesus' contemporaries sometimes applied this name to Jesus as
   a form of polite address, just as we use the word 'sir.' It is
   especially after the resurrection of Christ that the name acquires a
   deeper meaning. In some passages it designates Christ as the Owner and
   Ruler of the Church, Rom. 1:7; Eph. 1:17, and in others it really
   stands for the name of God, I Cor. 7:34; Phil. 4:4, 5.

   2. The Natures of Christ. The Bible represents Christ as a Person
   having two natures, the one divine and the other human. This is the
   great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh, I Tim. 3:16.

   a. The two natures. Since many in our day deny the deity of Christ, it
   is necessary to stress the Scripture proof for it. Some old Testament
   passages clearly point to it, Such as Isa. 9:6; Jer. 23:6; Micah 5:2;
   Mal. 3:1. The New Testament proofs are even more abundant, Matt. 11:27;
   16:16; 26:63, 64; John 1:1, 18; Rom. 9:5; I Cor. 2:8; II Cor. 5:10;
   Phil. 2:6; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 19:16. The humanity of Jesus is
   not called in question. In fact, the only divinity many still ascribe
   to Him is that of His perfect humanity. There is abundant proof for the
   humanity of Jesus. He speaks of Himself as man, John 8:40, and is so
   called by others, Acts 2:22; Rom. 5:15; I Cor. 15:21. He had the
   essential elements of human nature, namely, a body and a soul, Matt.
   26:26, 38; Luke 24:89; Heb. 2:14. Moreover, He was subject to the
   ordinary laws of human development, Luke 2:40, 52, and to human wants
   and sufferings, Matt. 4:2; 8:24; Luke 22:44; John 4:6; 11:35; 12:27;
   Heb. 2:10, 18; Heb. 5:7, 8. Yet though He was a real man, He was
   without sin; He did no sin and could not sin, John 8:46; II Cor. 5:21;
   Heb. 4:15; 9:14; I Pet. 2:22; I John 3:5. It was necessary that Christ
   should be both God and man. It was only as man that He could be our
   substitute, and could suffer and die; and only as sinless man that He
   could atone for the sins of others. And it was only as God that He
   could give His sacrifice infinite value, and bear the wrath of God so
   as to deliver others from it, Ps. 40:7-10; 130:8.

   b. The two natures united in one Person. Christ has a human nature, but
   He is not a human person. The Person of the Mediator is the
   unchangeable Son of God. In the incarnation He did not change into a
   human person; neither did He adopt a human person. He simply assumed,
   in addition to His divine nature, a human nature, which did not develop
   into an independent personality, but became personal in the Person of
   the Son of God. After this assumption of human nature the Person of the
   Mediator is not only divine but divine-human; He is the God-man,
   possessing all the essential qualities of both the human and the divine
   nature. He has both a divine and a human consciousness, as well as a
   human and a divine will. This is a mystery which we cannot fathom.
   Scripture clearly points to the unity of the Person of Christ. It is
   always the same Person who speaks, whether the mind that finds
   utterance be human or divine, John 10:30; 17:5 as compared with Matt.
   27:46; John 19:28. Human attributes and actions are sometimes ascribed
   to the Person designated by a divine title, Acts 20;28; I Cor. 2:8;
   Col. 1:13, 14; and divine attributes and actions are sometimes ascribed
   to the Person designated by a human title, John 3:13; 6:62; Rom. 9:5.

   c. Some of the most important errors concerning this doctrine. The
   Alogi and the Ebionites denied the deity of Christ in the early Church.
   This denial was shared by the Socinians of the days of the Reformation,
   and by the Unitarians and Modernists of our day. In the early Church
   Arius failed to do justice to the full deity of Christ and regarded Him
   as a demi-God, while Apollinaris did not recognize His full humanity,
   but held that the divine Logos took the place of the human spirit in
   Christ. The Nestorians denied the unity of the two natures in one
   Person, and the Eutychians failed to distinguish properly between the
   two natures.

   To memorize. Passages to prove:

   a. The deity of Christ.
   Isa. 9:6. "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the
   government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
   Peace."

   Jer. 23:6. "In His days shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell
   safely; and this is His name whereby He shall be called: Jehovah our
   righteousness."

   John 1:1. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God."

   Rom. 9:5. "Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning
   the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever."

   Col. 2:9. "For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the God"

   b. The humanity of Christ.
   John 8:40. "But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the
   truth, which I heard from God."

   Matt. 26:28. "Then said He unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
   even unto death: abide here and watch with me."

   Luke 24:39. "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself'. handle me,
   and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me
   having."

   Heb. 2:14. "Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, He
   also Himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death He
   might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil."

   e. The unity of the Person.
   John 17:5. "And now, Father, glorify Thou me with thine own self with
   the glory which I had with Thee before the world was."

   John 3:13. "And no one hath ascended into heaven, but He that descended
   out of heaven, even the Son of Man, who is in heaven."

   I Cor.2:8. "Which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had
   they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."

Chapter XV: The States of Christ

   We often use the words 'state' and 'condition' interchangeably. When we
   speak of the states of Christ, however, we use the word 'state' in a
   more specific sense, to denote the relation in which He stood and
   stands to the law. In the days of His humiliation He was a servant
   under the law; in His exaltation He is Lord, and as such above the law.
   Naturally these two states carried with them corresponding conditions
   of life, and these are discussed as the various stages of these states.

   1. The State of Humiliation. The state of humiliation consists in this
   that Christ laid aside the divine majesty which was His as the
   sovereign Ruler of the universe, and assumed human nature in the form
   of a servant; that He, the supreme Lawgiver, became subject to the
   demands and curse of the law. Matt. 3:15; Gal. 3:13; 4:4; Phil. 2:6-8.
   This state is reflected in the corresponding condition, in which we
   usually distinguish several stages. a. The incarnation and birth of
   Christ. In the incarnation the Son of God became flesh by assuming
   human nature, John 1:14; I John 4:2. He really became one of the human
   race by being born of Mary. This would not have been true, if He had
   brought His humanity from heaven, as the Anabaptists claim. The Bible
   teaches the virgin birth in Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:34, 35. This
   wonderful birth was due to the supernatural influence of the Holy
   Spirit, who also kept the human nature of Christ free from the
   pollution of sin from its very inception, Luke 1:35.

   b. The sufferings of Christ. We sometimes speak as if the sufferings of
   Christ were limited to His final agonies, but this is not correct. His
   whole life was a life of suffering. It was the servant life of the Lord
   of Hosts, the life of the sinless One in a sin-cursed world. Satan
   assaulted Him, His people rejected Him, and His enemies persecuted Him.
   The sufferings of the soul were even more intense than those of the
   body. He was tempted by the devil, was oppressed by the world of
   iniquity round about Him, and staggered by the burden of sin resting
   upon Him,-- "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." Isa. 53:3.

   c. The death, of Christ. When we speak of the death of Christ, we
   naturally have in mind His physical death. He did not die as the result
   of an accident, nor by the hand of an assassin, but under a judicial
   sentence, and was thus counted with the transgressors, Isa. 53:12. By
   suffering the Roman punishment of crucifixion He died an accursed
   death, bearing the curse for us, Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13. d. The burial
   of Christ. It might seem as if the death of Christ was the last stage
   of His sufferings. Did He not cry out on the cross, "It is finished"?
   But these words probably refer to His active suffering. His burial
   certainly was a part of His humiliation, of which He as Son of God was
   also conscious. Man's returning to the dust is a punishment for sin,
   Gen. 3:19. That the Saviour's abode in the grave was a humiliation, is
   evident from Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:27, 31; 13:34, 35. It removed for us the
   terrors of the grave.

   e. The descent into hades. The words of the Apostolic Confession, "He
   descended into hades," are variously interpreted. Roman Catholics say
   that He went down into the Limbus Patrum, where the Old Testament
   saints were confined, to release them; and the Lutherans that, between
   His death and resurrection, He went down to hell to preach and to
   celebrate his victory over the powers of darkness. In all probability
   it is a figurative expression to denote (1) that He suffered the pangs
   of hell in the garden and on the cross, and (2) that He entered the
   deepest humiliation of the state of death, Ps. 16:8-10; Eph. 4:9.

   2. The State of Exaltation. In the state of exaltation Christ passed
   from under the law as a covenant obligation, having paid the penalty of
   sin and merited righteousness and eternal life for the sinner.
   Moreover, He was crowned with a corresponding honor and glory. Four
   stages must be distinguished here.

   a. The resurrection. The resurrection of Christ did not consist in the
   mere re-union of body and soul, but especially in this that in Him
   human nature, both body and soul, was restored to its original beauty
   and strength, and even raised to a higher level. In distinction from
   all those who had been raised up before Him He arose with a spiritual
   body, I Cor. 15:44, 45. For that reason He can be called "the first
   fruits of them that slept," I Cor. 15:20, and "the firstborn of the
   dead," Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5. The resurrection of Christ has a threefold
   significance: (1) It was a declaration of the Father that Christ met
   all the requirements of the law, Phil. 2:9. (2) It symbolized the
   justification, regeneration, and final resurrection of believers, Rom.
   6:4, 5, 9; I Cor. 6:14; 15:20-22. (3) It was the cause of our
   justification, regeneration, and resurrection, Rom. 4:25; 5:10; Eph.
   1:20; Phil. 3:10; I Pet. 1:3.

   b. The ascension. The ascension was in a sense the necessary completion
   of the resurrection, but it also had independent significance. We have
   a double account of it, namely, in Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:6-11. Paul
   refers to it in Eph. 1:20; 4:8-10; I Tim. 3:16, and the Epistle to the
   Hebrews stresses its significance, 1:3; 4:14; 6:20; 9:24. It was a
   visible ascent of the Mediator, according to His human nature, from
   earth to heaven, a going from one place to another. It included a
   further glorification of the human nature of Christ. The Lutherans have
   a different view of it. They conceive of it as a change of condition,
   whereby the human nature of Jesus passed into the full enjoyment of
   certain divine attributes, and became permanently omnipresent. In the
   ascension Christ as our great high priest enters the inner sanctuary to
   present His sacrifice to the Father and begin His work as intercessor
   at the throne, Rom. 8:34; Heb. 4:14; 6:20; 9:24. He ascended to prepare
   a place for us, John 14:1-3. With Him we are already set in heavenly
   places, and in His ascension we have the assurance of a place in
   heaven, Eph. 2:6; John 17:24.

   c. The session at God's right hand. After His ascension Christ is
   seated at the right hand of God, Eph. 1:20; Heb. 10:12; I Pet. 3:22.
   Naturally, the expression 'right hand of God' cannot be taken
   literally, but should be understood as a figurative indication of the
   place of power and glory. During His session at God's right hand Christ
   rules and protects His Church, governs the universe in its behalf, and
   intercedes for His people on the basis of His completed sacrifice.

   d. The physical return. The exaltation of Christ reaches its climax,
   when He returns to judge the living and the dead. Evidently His return
   will be bodily and visible, Acts 1:11; Rev. 1:7. That He will come as
   Judge is evident from such passages as John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; Rom.
   2:16; II Cor. 5:10; II Tim. 4:1. The time of His second coming is not
   known to us. He will come for the purpose of judging the world and
   perfecting the salvation of His people. This will mark the complete
   victory of His redemptive work. I Cor. 4:5; Phil. 3:20; Col. 3:4; I
   Thess. 4:13-17; II Thess. 1:7-10; II Thess. 2:1-12; Tit. 2:13; Rev.
   1:7. To memorize. Passages bearing on:

   a. The state of humiliation:
   Gal. 3:13. "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become
   a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on
   a tree."

   Gal. 4:4, 5. "But when the fulness of time came, God sent forth His
   Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that He might redeem them
   that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."

   Phil. 2:6-8. "Who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being
   on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself,
   taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and
   being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient
   even unto death, yea, the death of the cross."

   b. The incarnation:
   John 1:14. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we
   beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full
   of grace and truth."

   Rom. 8:3. "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
   the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
   and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."

   c. The virgin birth:
   Isa. 7:14. "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall
   call His name Immanuel."

   Luke 2:86. "And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit
   shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow
   thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called
   the Son of God."

   d. The descent into hades:
   Ps. 16:10. "For Thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol (hades, Acts
   2:27); neither wilt Thou suffer Thy holy one to see corruption."

   Eph. 4:9. "Now this, He ascended, what is it but that He also descended
   into the lower parts of the earth?"

   e. The resurrection:
   Rom. 4:25. "Who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for
   our justification."

   I Cor. 15:20. "But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the
   first-fruits of them that are asleep."

   f. The ascension:
   Luke 24:51. "And it came to pass, while He blessed them, He was parted
   from them, and was carried up into heaven."

   Acts 1:11. "Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into
   heaven? This same Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven,
   shall so come in like manner as ye have beheld Him going into heaven."

   g. The session:

   Eph. 1:20. "Which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the
   dead, and made Him to sit at His right hand in the heavenly places."

   Heb. 10:12. "But He, when He had offered one sacrifice for sins for
   ever, sat down on the right hand of God."

   h. The return:
   Acts 1:11. Cf. above under f.

   Rev. 1:7. "Behold, He cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see
   Him, and they that pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth shall
   mourn over Him."

   For Further Study:
   a. What does the Old Testament tell us about the humiliation of Christ
   in the following passages: Ps. 22:6-20; 69:7-9; 20:21; Isa. 52:14, 15;
   53:1-10; Zech. 11:12, 13.

   b. What was the special value of Christ's temptations for us? Heb.
   2:18; 4:15; 5:7-9.

   c. How do the following passages prove that heaven is a place rather
   than a condition? Deut. 30:12; Josh. 2:11; Ps. 139:8; Eccl. 5:2; Isa.
   66:1; Rom. 10:6, 7.

Chapter XVI: The Offices of Christ

   The Bible ascribes a threefold office to Christ, speaking of Him as
   Prophet, Priest, and King.

   1. The Prophetic Office. The Old Testament predicted the coming of
   Christ as a prophet, Deut. 18:15 (comp. Acts 3:23). He speaks of
   Himself as a prophet in Luke 13:33, claims to bring a message from the
   Father, John 8:26-28; 12:49, 50; 14:10, 24, foretells future things,
   Matt. 24:3-35; Luke 19:41-44, and speaks with singular authority, Matt.
   7:29. It is no wonder, therefore, that the people recognized Him as a
   prophet, Matt. 21:11, 46; Luke 7:16; 24:19; John 6:14; 7:40; 9:17. A
   prophet is one who receives divine revelations in dreams, visions, or
   verbal communications; and passes these on to the people either orally
   or visibly in prophetic actions. Ex. 7:1; Deut. 18:18; Num. 12:6-8;
   Isa. 6; Jer. 1:4-10; Ezek. 3:1-4, 17. His work may pertain to the past,
   the present, or the future. One of his important tasks was to interpret
   the moral and spiritual aspects of the law for the people. Christ
   functioned as prophet already in the Old Testament, I Pet. 1:11;
   3:18-20. He did it while He was on earth, and continued it by the
   operation of the Holy Spirit and through the apostles after the
   ascension, John 14:26; 16:12-14; Acts 1:1. And even now his prophetic
   ministry continues through the ministry of the Word and the spiritual
   illumination of believers. This is the only function of Christ which is
   recognized in modern liberal theology.

   2. The Priestly Office. The Old Testament also predicted and prefigured
   the priesthood of the coming Redeemer, Ps. 110:4; Zech. 6:18; Isa. 53.
   In the New Testament there is only a single book in which He is called
   priest, namely, Hebrews, but there the name is found repeatedly, 3:1;
   4:14; 5:5; 6:20; 7:26; 8:1. However, other books refer to His priestly
   work, Mark 10:45; John 1:29; Rom. 3:24, 25; I Cor. 5:7; I John 2:2; I
   Pet. 2:24; 3:18 While a prophet represented God among the people, a
   priest represented the people before God. Both were teachers, but while
   the former taught the moral, the latter taught the ceremonial law.
   Moreover, the priests had the special privilege of approach to God, and
   of speaking and acting in behalf of the people. Hebrews 5:1, 3 teaches
   us that a priest is taken from among men to be their representative, is
   appointed by God, is active before God in the interests of men, and
   offers gifts and sacrifices for sins. He also makes intercession for
   the people.

   The priestly work of Christ was, first of all, to bring a sacrifice for
   sin. The Old Testament sacrifices were types pointing forward to the
   great sacrifice of Christ, Heb. 9:23, 24; 10:1, 13:11, 12. Hence Christ
   is also called "the Lamb of God," John 1:29, and "our passover," I Cor.
   5:7. The New Testament speaks very clearly of the priestly work of
   Christ in numerous passages: Mark 10:45; John 1:29; Rom. 3:24, 25;
   5:6-8; I Cor. 5:7; 15:3; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 5:2; I Pet. 2:24; 3:18; I John
   2:2; 4:10; Rev. 5:12. The references are most frequent in the Epistle
   to the Hebrews 5:1-10; 7:1-28; 9:11-15, 24-28; 10:11-14, 19-22; 12:24;
   13:12.

   Besides bringing the great sacrifice for sins, Christ as priest also
   makes intercession for His people. He is called our parakletos by
   implication in John 14:16, and explicitly in I John 2:2. The term means
   'one who is called in to help, an advocate, one who pleads the cause of
   another.' The New Testament refers to Christ as our intercessor in Rom.
   8:34; Heb. 7:25; 9:24; I John 2:1. His intercessory work is based on
   His sacrifice, and is not limited, as is sometimes thought, to
   intercessory prayer. He presents His sacrifice to God, on the ground of
   it claims all spiritual blessings for His people, defends them against
   the charges of Satan, the law, and conscience, secures forgiveness for
   everything justly charged against them, and sanctifies their worship
   and service through the operation of the Holy Spirit. This intercessory
   work is limited in character; it has reference only to the elect, but
   includes all the elect, whether they are already believers or still
   live in unbelief, John 17:9, 20.

   3. The Kingly Office. As Son of God Christ naturally shares in the
   universal dominion of God. In distinction from this we speak of a
   kingship that was conferred on Him as Mediator This kingship is
   twofold, namely, His spiritual kingship over the Church, and His
   kingship over the universe.

   a. His spiritual kingship. The Bible speaks of this in many places, Ps.
   2:6; 132:11; Isa. 9:6, 7; Micah 5:2; Zech. 6:13; Luke 1:33; 19:38; John
   18:36, 37; Acts 2:30-36. The kingship of Christ is His royal rule over
   His people. It is called spiritual, because it relates to a spiritual
   realm, is established in the hearts and lives of believers, has a
   spiritual end in view, the salvation of sinners, and is administered by
   spiritual means, the Word and the Spirit. It is exercised largely in
   the gathering, the government, the protection, and the perfection of
   the Church. This kingship as well as the realm over which it extends is
   called in the New Testament "the kingdom of God" or "the kingdom of
   heaven." In the strict sense of the word only believers, members of the
   invisible Church, are citizens of the kingdom. But the term 'kingdom of
   God' is sometimes used in a broader sense, as including all who live
   under the proclamation of the gospel, all who have a place in the
   visible Church, Matt. 13:24-30, 47-50. This kingdom of God is on the
   one hand a present, spiritual reality in the hearts and lives of men,
   Matt. 12:28; Luke 17:21; Col. 1:13; but on the other hand a future
   hope, which will not be realized until the return of Jesus Christ,
   Matt. 7:21; Luke 22:29; I Cor. 15:50; II Tim. 4:18; II Pet. 1:11. The
   future kingdom will be essentially the same as the present, namely, the
   rule of God established and acknowledged in the hearts of men. It will
   differ, however, in that it will be visible and perfect. Some are of
   the opinion that this kingship of Christ will cease at His return, but
   the Bible would seem to teach explicitly that it will endure forever,
   Ps. 45:6; 72:17; 39:36; 37; Isa. 9:6; Dan. 2:44; II Sam. 7:13, 16; Luke
   1:33; II Pet. 1:11.

   b. His universal kingship, After the resurrection Christ said to His
   disciples: "All authority hath been given unto Me in heaven and on
   earth." Matt. 28:18. The same truth is taught in I Cor. 15:27; Eph.
   1:20-22. This kingship should not be confused with the original
   kingship of Christ as the Son of God, though it pertains to the same
   realm. It is the kingship of the universe entrusted to Christ as
   Mediator in behalf of His Church. As Mediator He now guides the destiny
   of individuals and nations, controls the life of the world and makes it
   subservient to His redemptive purpose, and protects His Church against
   the dangers to which it is exposed in the world. This kingship will
   last until the victory over the enemies of the kingdom of God is
   complete. When the end is accomplished, it will be returned to the
   Father. I Cor. 15:24-28. To memorize. Passages pointing to:

   a. Christ as prophet:
   Deut. 18:18. "I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren,
   like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall
   speak unto them all that I shall command him."

   Luke 7:16. "And fear took hold on them all; and they glorified God,
   saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and God hath visited His
   people."

   consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus."

   Heb. 4:14. "Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through
   the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."

   c. His characteristics as priest:
   Heb. 5:1, 5. "For every high priest, being taken from among men, is
   appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both
   gifts and sacrifices for sins... So Christ also glorified not Himself
   to be made a high priest, but He that spake unto Him, Thou art My Son,
   this day have I begotten Thee."

   d. His sacrificial work:
   Isa. 53:5. "But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised
   for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and
   with his stripes we are healed."

   Mark 10:45. "For the Son of Man also came not to be ministered unto,
   but to minister, and to give His soul a ransom for many."

   John 1:29. "Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
   world."

   I Pet. 2:24. "Who His own self bare sins in His body upon the tree,
   that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness."

   I John 2:2. "And He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours
   only, but for the whole world."

   e. His intercessory work:
   Rom. 8:34. "It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised
   from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh
   intercession for us."

   Heb. 7:25. "Wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost them
   that draw near unto God through Him, seeing He ever liveth to make
   intercession for them."

   I John 2:1b. "And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
   Jesus Christ the righteous."

   f. Christ as King of Zion:
   Ps. 2:6. "Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion."

   Isa. 9:7. "Of the increase of His government and of peace there shall
   be no end upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to establish
   it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from
   henceforth even for ever."

   Luke 1:32, 33. "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the
   Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His
   father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and
   of His kingdom there shall be no end."

   g. Christ as king of the universe:

Chapter XVII: The Atonement Through Christ

   There is one part of Christ's priestly work that calls for further
   consideration, namely, the atonement.

   1. The Moving Cause and Necessity of the Atonement. It is sometimes
   represented as if the moving cause of the atonement lay in Christ's
   sympathy for sinners. God in His anger, it is said, was bent on the
   sinner's destruction, but the loving Christ steps in between and saves
   the sinner. Christ receives all the glory, and the Father is robbed of
   His honour. The Bible teaches us that the atonement finds its moving
   cause in the good pleasure of God, Isa. 53:10; Luke 2:14; Eph. 1:6-9;
   Col. 1:19, 20. It is best to say that the atonement is rooted in the
   love and justice of God: love offered sinners a way of escape, and
   justice demanded that the requirements of the law should be met, John
   3:16; Rom. 3:24-26. Some deny the necessity of the atonement, and hold
   that God could have pardoned the sinner without receiving any
   satisfaction. The Bible teaches however, that a righteous and holy God
   cannot simply overlook sin, but reacts against it, Ex. 20:5; 23:7; Ps.
   5:5, 6; Nah. 1:2; Rom. 1:18, 32. Moreover, He had pronounced the
   sentence of death upon the sinner, Gen. 3:3; Rom. 6:23.

   2. The Nature of the Atonement. The following particulars should be
   noted here:

   a. It served to render satisfaction to God. It is often said that the
   atonement served primarily, if not exclusively, to influence the
   sinner, to awaken repentance in his heart, and thus to bring him back
   to God. But this is clearly wrong, for if a person offends another,
   amends should be made, not to the offender, but to the offended party.
   This means that the primary purpose of the atonement was to reconcile
   God to the sinner. The reconciliation of the sinner to God may be
   regarded as its secondary purpose.

   b. It was a vicarious atonement. God might have demanded a personal
   atonement of the sinner, but the latter would not have been able to
   render it. In view of this fact God graciously ordained that Christ
   should take the place of man as his vicar or substitute. Christ as our
   vicar atoned for the sin of mankind by bearing the penalty of sin and
   meeting the demands of the law, and thus wrought an eternal redemption
   for man. For that reason we speak of the atonement as a vicarious
   atonement. The offended party Himself made provision for the atonement
   in this case. The Old Testament sacrifices prefigured the atoning work
   of Christ, Lev. 1:4; 4:20, 31, 35; 5:10, 16; 6:7; 17:11. We are taught
   that our sins were laid upon Christ, Isa. 53:6, He bore them, John
   1:29, Heb. 9:28, and gave His life for sinners, Mark 10:45; Gal. 1:4; I
   Pet. 3:18.

   c. It included Christ's active and passive obedience. It is customary
   to distinguish a twofold obedience of Christ. His active obedience
   consists in all that He did to observe the law in behalf of sinners, as
   a condition for obtaining eternal life; and His passive obedience in
   all that He suffered in paying the penalty of sin and discharging the
   debt of His people. But while we distinguish these two, we should never
   separate them. Christ was active also in His suffering, and passive
   also in His submission to the law. Scripture teaches us that He paid
   the penalty of the law, Isa. 53:8; Rom. 4:25; Gal. 3:13; I Pet. 2:24,
   and merited eternal life for the sinner, Rom. 8:4; 10:4; II Cor. 5:21;
   Gal. 4:4-7. 3. The Extent of the Atonement. Roman Catholics, Lutherans,
   and Arminians of every description regard the atonement of Christ as
   universal. This does not mean that in their estimation all men will be
   saved, but merely that Christ suffered and died for the purpose of
   saving all without any exception. They admit that the intended effect
   is not achieved. Christ did not actually save, but made salvation
   possible for all. Their actual redemption is dependent on their own
   choice. Reformed Churches on the other hand believe in a limited
   atonement. Christ suffered and died for the purpose of saving only the
   elect, and that purpose is actually accomplished. Christ not merely
   made salvation possible but really saves to the uttermost every one of
   those for whom he laid down His life, Luke 19:10; Rom. 5:10; II Cor.
   5:21; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 1:7. The Bible indicates that Christ laid down His
   life for His people. Matt. 1:21, for His sheep, John 10:11, 15, for the
   Church, Acts 20:28; Eph. 5:25-27, or for the elect, Rom. 8:82-35. If
   the Bible sometimes says that Christ died for the world, John 1:29; I
   John 2:2; 4:14, or for all, I Tim. 2:6; Tit. 2:11; Heb. 2:9, this
   evidently means that He died for people of all nations of the world, or
   (in some instances) for all kinds or classes of people.

   To memorize. Passages bearing on:

   a. The cause of the atonement.
   Isa. 53:10. "Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him; He hath put Him to
   grief: when Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see
   His seed, He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall
   prosper in His hand."

   Col. 1:19, 20. "For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him
   should all the fullness dwell; and through Him to reconcile all things
   unto Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross."

   b. Vicarious atonement.

   Isa. 53:6. "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every
   one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on Him the iniquity of us
   all."

   Mark 10:45. "For the Son also came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister, and to give His life a ransom for many."

   II Cor. 5:21. "Him who knew no sin He made to be sin on our behalf;
   that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."

   I Pet. 2:24. "Who His own self bare our sins in His body upon the tree,
   that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness."

   c. Active obedience and the gift of eternal life.
   Matt. 3:15. "But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it now: for thus
   it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness."

   Matt. 5:17. "Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets:
   I came not to destroy, but to fulfil."

   Gal. 4:4, 5. "But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His
   Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that He might redeem them
   that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."

   John 10:28. "And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never
   perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand." Rom. 6:23. "For
   the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in
   Christ Jesus our Lord." d. Limited atonement.

   Matt. 1:21. "And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call His
   name Jesus; for it is He that shall save His people from their sins."

   John 10:26-28. "But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. My
   sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give
   unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall
   snatch them out of my hand."

   Acts 20:28. "Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flocks, in which
   the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the Church of the Lord
   which He purchased with His own blood."

   Chapter XVIII: The Common Operation of the Holy Spirit: Common Grace

   The study of the work of redemption wrought by Christ is naturally
   followed by a discussion of the application of this redemption to the
   hearts and lives of sinners by the special operation of thy Holy
   Spirit. Before taking this up a brief chapter will be devoted to the
   general operations of the Holy Spirit, as these are seen in common
   grace.

   1. Nature of Common Grace. When we speak of common grace, we have in
   mind either (a) those general operations of the Holy Spirit whereby He,
   without renewing the heart, exercises such a moral influence on man
   that sin is restrained, order is maintained in social life, and civil
   righteousness is promoted; or (b) those general blessings which God
   imparts to all men without any distinction as He sees fit. In
   distinction from the Arminians we maintain that common grace does not
   enable the sinner to perform any spiritual good, nor to turn to God in
   faith and repentance. It can be resisted by man, and is always more or
   less resisted, and at best affects only the externals of social, civil,
   moral, and religious life. While Christ died for the purpose of saving
   only the elect, nevertheless the whole human race, including the
   impenitent and the reprobate, derive great benefits from His death. The
   blessings of common grace may be regarded as indirect results of the
   atoning work of Christ.

   2. Means of Common Grace. Several means may be distinguished: (a) The
   most important of these is the light of God's general revelation.
   Without this all other means would be impossible and ineffective. It
   lightens every man, and serves to guide the conscience of the natural
   man. (b) Human governments also serve this purpose. According to our
   Confession they are instituted to curb evil tendencies, and to promote
   good order and decency. (c) Public opinion is another important means
   wherever it is in harmony with the law of God. It has a tremendous
   influence on the conduct of men who are very sensitive to the judgment
   of public opinion. (d) Finally, divine punishments and rewards also
   serve to encourage moral goodness in the world. The punishments often
   check the sinful deeds of men, and the rewards spur them on to do what
   is good and right.

   3. The Effects of Common Grace. The following effects may be ascribed
   to the operation of common grace: (a) The execution of the sentence of
   death on man is deferred. God did not at once fully execute the
   sentence of death on the sinner, and does not do so now, but gives him
   time for repentance, Rom. 2:4; II Pet. 8:9. (b) Sin is restrained in
   the lives of individuals and nations The corruption that entered human
   life through sin is retarded and not yet permitted to complete its
   destructive work, Gen. 20:6; 31:7; Job 1:12; 2:6. (c) Man still has
   some sense of the true, the good, and the beautiful, appreciates this
   in a measure, and reveals a desire for truth, morality, and certain
   forms of religion, Rom. 2:14, 15; Acts 17:22. (d) The natural man is
   still able to perform natural good or civil righteousness, works that
   are outwardly in harmony with the law, though without spiritual value,
   II Kings 10:29, 30; 12:2; 14;3; Luke 6:33. (e) All men receive numerous
   undeserved blessings from God, Ps. 145:9, 15, 16; Matt. 5:44, 45; Luke
   6:35, 36; Acts 14:16, 17; I Tim. 4;10.

   To memorize. Passages proving:

   a. A general striving of the Spirit with men:
   Gen. 6:3. "And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for
   ever, for that he also is flesh."

   Isa. 68:10. "But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit: therefore
   He was turned to be their enemy, and Himself fought against them."

   Rom. 1:28, "And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge,
   God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
   not fitting."

   b. Restraint of sin:
   Gen. 20:6. "And God said unto him (Abimelech) in the dream, Yea, I know
   that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also
   withheld thee from sinning against me."

   Gen. 31:7. "And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
   times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."

   Ps. 105:14. "He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, Ho reproved
   kings for their sakes."

   c. Good works on the part of unregenerate:
   II Kings 10:30. "And Jehovah said unto Jehu, because thou hast done
   well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
   the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of
   the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel." Cf. vs. 31.

   Luke 6:33. "And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank
   have ye? for even sinners do the same."

   Rom. 2:14, 15. "For when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature
   the things of the law, these not having the law, are the law unto
   themselves; in that they show the work of the law written in their
   hearts."

   d. Unmerited blessings on all men:
   Ps. 145:9. "Jehovah is good to all; and His tender mercies are over all
   His works."

   Matt. 5:44, 45. "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for
   them that persecute you; that ye may be sons of your Father who is in
   heaven: for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and the unjust."

   I Tim. 4:10. "For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our
   hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially
   of them that believe."

   For Further Study:

   a. Which are the three points emphasized by our Church as to common
   grace?

   b. How do Matt. 21:26, 46; Mark 14:2 show the restraining influence of
   public opinion?

   c. How do Rom. 1:24, 26, 28, and Heb. 6:4-6 prove common grace?

   2. What is our view in distinction from the Arminian?

   3. Does common grace have any spiritual and saving effect?

   4. Is it in any way connected with the redemptive work of Christ?

Chapter XIV: Calling and Regeneration

   1. Calling. Calling in general may be defined as that gracious act of
   God whereby He invites sinners to accept the salvation that is offered
   in Christ Jesus.

   It may be either external or internal.

   a. External calling. The Bible speaks of this or refers to it in
   several passages, Matt. 28:19; 22:14; Luke 14:16-24; Acts 13:46; II
   Thess. 1:8; I John 5:10. It consists in the presentation and offering
   of salvation in Christ to sinners, together with an earnest exhortation
   to accept Christ by faith in order to obtain the forgiveness of sins
   and eternal life. From the definition it already appears that it
   contains three elements, namely, (1) A presentation of the gospel facts
   and ideas; (2) an invitation to repent and believe in Jesus Christ, and
   (3) a promise of forgiveness and salvation. The promise is always
   conditional; its fulfillment can be expected only in the way of true
   faith and repentance. The external call is universal in the sense that
   it comes to all men to whom the gospel is preached. It is not limited
   to any age or nation or class of men, and comes to the reprobate as
   well as to the elect, Isa. 45:22; 55:1; Ezek. 3:19; Joel 2:32; Matt.
   22:2-8, 14; Rev. 22:17. Naturally this call, as coming from God, is
   seriously meant. He calls sinners in good faith, earnestly desires that
   they accept the invitation, and in all sincerity promises eternal life
   to those who repent and believe. Num. 23:19; Ps. 81:13-16; Prov. 1:24;
   Isa. 1:18-20; Ezek. 18:23, 32; 33:11; Matt. 23:37; II Tim. 2:18. In the
   external call God maintains His claim on the sinner. If man does not
   accept the call, he slights the claim of God and thus increases his
   guilt. It is also the appointed means by which God gathers the elect
   out of all the nations of the world, Rom. 10:14-17, and should be
   regarded as a blessing for sinners, though they may turn it into a
   curse, Isa. 1:18-20; Ezek. 3:18, 19; Amos 8:11; Matt. 11:20-24; 23:37.
   Finally, it also serves to justify God in the condemnation of sinners.
   If they despise the offer of salvation, their guilt stands out in the
   clearest light, John 5:39, 40; Rom. 3:5, 6, 19.

   b. Internal calling. While we distinguish two aspects of the calling of
   God, this calling is really one. The internal call is really the
   external call made effective by the operation of the Holy Spirit. It
   always comes to the sinner through the Word of God, savingly applied by
   the operation of the Holy Spirit, I Cor. 1:23, 24. In distinction from
   the external call, it is a powerful calling that is effectual unto
   salvation, Acts 13:48; I Cor. 1:23, 24. Moreover, it is a calling
   without repentance, one that is not subject to change, and is never
   withdrawn, Rom. 11:29. The person called will surely be saved. The
   Spirit operates through the preaching of the Word by making its
   persuasions effective, so that man listens to the voice of His God. It
   addresses itself to the understanding enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
   so that man is conscious of it. And it is always directed to a certain
   end. It is a calling to the fellowship of Jesus Christ, I Cor. 1:9, to
   inherit blessing, I Pet. 8:9, to liberty, Gal. 6:18, to peace, I Cor.
   7:15; to holiness, I Thess. 4:7; to one hope, Eph. 4:4, to eternal
   life, I Tim. 6:12, and to God's kingdom and glory, I Thess. 2:12. 2.
   Regeneration. Divine calling and regeneration stand in the closest
   possible relation to each other. With respect to regeneration several
   points deserve consideration:

   a. Its nature. The word 'regeneration' is not always used in the same
   sense. Our Confession uses it in a broad sense, as including even
   conversion. At present it has a more restricted meaning. In the most
   restricted sense it denotes that act of God by which the principle of
   the new life is implanted in man, and the governing disposition of the
   soul is made holy. In a slightly more comprehensive sense it
   designates, in addition to the preceding, the new birth or the first
   manifestation of the new life. It is a fundamental change in the
   principle of life and the governing disposition of the soul, and
   therefore affects the whole man, I Cor. 2:14; II Cor. 4:6; Phil. 2:13;
   I Pet. 1:8. It is completed in a moment of time, and is not a gradual
   process like sanctification. Through it we pass from death into life, I
   John 3:14. It is a secret and inscrutable work of God that is never
   directly perceived by man, but can be known only by its effects.

   b. Its author. God is the author of regeneration. Scripture represents
   it as the work of the Holy Spirit, John 1:13; Acts 16:14; John 3:5, 8.
   Over against the Arminians we maintain that it is exclusively the work
   of the Spirit of God, and not in part the work of man. There is no
   co-operation of God and man in the work of regeneration, as there is in
   the work of conversion. Moreover, it should be said that regeneration
   in the most restricted sense of the word, that is, as the implanting of
   the new life, is a direct and immediate work of the Holy Spirit. It is
   a creative work in which for that very reason the word of the gospel
   cannot very well be used as an instrument. It may be said that Jas.
   1:18 and I Pet. 1:23 prove that the word of preaching is used as an
   instrument in regeneration, but these passages refer to regeneration in
   a broader sense, as including the new birth. In that more inclusive
   sense regeneration is undoubtedly wrought through the instrumentality
   of the Word.

   c. Its necessity and place in the order of salvation. Scripture leaves
   no doubt as to the absolute necessity of regeneration, but asserts this
   in the clearest terms, John 3:3, 5, 7; I Cor. 2:14; Gal. 6:15. This
   follows from the fact that we are by nature dead in trespasses and sin,
   and must be endowed with new spiritual 1ife, in order to enjoy the
   divine favor and communion with God. The question is often raised which
   of the two is first, calling or regeneration. In answer to this it may
   be said that in the case of adults external calling usually precedes or
   coincides with regeneration in the restricted sense. Regeneration, as
   the implanting of the new life, precedes internal calling, and internal
   calling precedes regeneration in the broader sense, or the new birth.
   We find the greater part of this order indicated in the record of the
   conversion of Lydia, Acts 16:14, "And a certain woman named Lydia, a
   seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God,
   heard us (external call): whose heart the Lord opened (regeneration in
   the restricted sense) to give heed to the things which were spoken by
   Paul (internal call)."

   To memorize. Passages proving:

   a External calling:
   Mark 16:15, 16. "And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and
   preach the gospel to the whole creation ("every creature," Auth. Ver.).
   He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
   disbelieveth shall be condemned."

   Matt. 22:14. "For many are called, but few are chosen."

   Acts 13:46. "And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was
   necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye
   thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo,
   we turn to the Gentiles."

   b. Calling of the reprobate:
   Prov. 1:24-26. "Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have
   stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded; but ye have set at
   nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh
   in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh."

   I Pet. 3:19, 20a. "In which also He (Christ) went and preached unto the
   spirits in prison, that aforetime were disobedient, when the
   longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah."

   Confer also the parables in Matt. 22:1-8, 14; Luke 14:16-24.

   c. Seriousness of this calling:
   Prov. 1:24-26, cf. above under b.

   Ezek. 18:23, 32. "Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? said
   the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way
   and, live?... For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
   saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live." Cf. also
   33:11.

   Matt. 23:37. " Jerusalem, Jerusalem, .that killeth the prophets, and
   stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered
   thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
   wings, and ye would not."

   d. The necessity of regeneration:
   Jer. 13:23, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
   spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil."

   John 3:3, 7. "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say
   unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God.... Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."

   e. Regeneration and the Word.
   Jas. 1:18. "Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth,
   that we should be a kind of first fruits of His creatures."

   I Pet. 1:23. "Having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but
   of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth."

   For Further Study:

   a. Is calling a work of one Person of the Trinity or of all three? I
   Cor. 1:9; I Thess. 2:12; Matt. 11:28; Luke 5:32; Matt. 10:20; Acts
   5:31, 32.

   b. Is the word 'regeneration' used in the Bible? Tit. 3:5. What other
   terms does it use to express this idea? John 3:3, 5, 7, 8; II Cor.
   5:17; Eph. 2:5; Col. 2:13; Jas. 1:18; I Pet. 1:23.

   c. Does Tit. 3:5 prove that we are regenerated by baptism? If not, how
   would you explain it?

Chapter XX: Conversion: Repentance and Faith

   When the change wrought in regeneration begins to manifest itself in
   the conscious life, we speak of conversion.

   1. Conversion in General. The Bible does not always speak of conversion
   in the same sense. The conversion we have in mind here may be defined
   as that act of God whereby He causes the regenerated, in their
   conscious life, to turn to Him in faith and repentance. From this
   definition it already appears that God is the author of conversion.
   This is clearly taught in Scripture, Acts 11:18; II Tim. 2:25. The new
   life of regeneration does not of itself issue in a conscious change of
   life, but only through a special operation of the Holy Spirit, John
   6:44; Phil. 2:13. But while in regeneration God only works and man is
   passive, in conversion man is called upon to co-operate, Isa. 55:7;
   Jer. 18:11; Acts 2:38; 17:30. But even so man can only work with the
   power which God imparts to him. Like regeneration conversion too
   consists in a momentary change, and is not a process like
   sanctification; but in distinction from regeneration it is a change in
   the conscious rather than in the unconscious life of man. While
   conversion is necessary in the case of all adults, Ezek. 33:11; Matt.
   18:3, it need not appear in the life of each one of them as a sharply
   marked crisis. The Bible mentions instances of conversion, such as
   Naaman, II Kings 5:15; Manasseh, II Chron. 33:12, 13; Zacchmus, Luke
   19:8, 9; the eunuch, Acts 8:80 ff.; Cornelius, Acts 10:44 ff.; Paul,
   Acts 9:5 ff.; Lydia, Acts 16:14, and so on. Besides this it also speaks
   of a national conversion, as in Jonah 3:10, a temporary conversion,
   which includes no change of heart, Matt. 13:20, 21; I Tim. 1:19. 20; II
   Tim. 4:10; Heb. 6:4-6, and a repeated conversion, Luke 22:32; Rev. 2:5,
   16, 21, 22; 3:8, 19. This is not a repetition of conversion in the
   strict sense of the word, which does not admit of repetition, but a
   revived activity of the new life after it has suffered eclipse.
   Conversion comprises two elements, the one negative and the other
   positive, namely repentance and faith, which call for separate
   discussion.

   2. Repentance, the Negative Element of Conversion. Repentance looks to
   the past, and may be defined as that change wrought in the conscious
   life of the sinner by which he turns away from sin. It includes three
   elements, namely, (a) an intellectual element, in which the past life
   is viewed as a life of sin, involving personal guilt, defilement, and
   helplessness; (b) an emotional element, a sense of sorrow for sin as
   committed against a holy and just God; and (c) an element of the will,
   consisting in a change of purpose, an inward turning from sin and a
   disposition to seek pardon and cleansing. Rom. 3:20; II Cor. 7:9, 10;
   Rom. 2:4. It is wrought in man primarily by the law of God. Roman
   Catholics have an external conception of repentance. According to them
   it comprises a sorrow, not for inborn sin, but for personal
   transgressions, which may merely result from the fear of eternal
   punishment; a confession made to the priest, who can forgive sin; and a
   measure of satisfaction by external deeds of penance, such as fastings,
   scourgings, pilgrimages, and so on. The Bible, on the other hand, views
   repentance wholly as an inward act, an act of real sorrow on account of
   sin, and does not confuse this with the change of life in which it
   results.

   3. Faith, the Positive Element of Conversion. In distinction from
   repentance, faith has a forward look.

   a. Different kinds of faith. The Bible does not always speak of faith
   in the same sense. It refers to a historical faith, consisting in an
   intellectual acceptance of the truth of Scripture without any real
   moral or spiritual response. Such a faith does not take the truth
   seriously and shows no real interest in it. Acts 26:27, 28; Jas. 2:19.
   It also speaks of a temporal faith, which embraces the truths of
   religion with some promptings of conscience and a stirring of the
   affections, but is not rooted in a regenerated heart. It is called
   temporal faith, Matt. 13:20, 21, because it has no abiding character
   and fails to maintain itself in days of trial and persecution. Cf. also
   Heb. 6:4-6; 1 Tim. 1:19, 20; I John 2:19. Moreover, it makes mention of
   a miraculous faith, that is a person's conviction that a miracle will
   be performed by him or in his behalf. Matt. 8:11-13; 17:20; Mark 16:17,
   18; John 11:22, 40; Acts 14:9. This faith may or may not be accompanied
   with saving faith. Finally, it not only names, but stresses the
   necessity of, saving faith. This has its seat in the heart and is
   rooted in the regenerated life. Its seed is implanted in regeneration
   and gradually blossoms into an active faith. It may be defined as a
   positive conation, wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, as to the
   truth of the gospel, and a hearty reliance on the promises of God in
   Christ.

   b. The elements of faith. We distinguish three elements in true saving
   faith. (1) An intellectual element. There is a positive recognition of
   the truth revealed in the Word of God, a spiritual insight which finds
   response in the heart of the sinner. It is an absolutely certain
   knowledge, based on the promises of God. While it need not be
   comprehensive, it should be sufficient to give the believer some idea
   of the fundamental truths of the gospel. (2) An emotional element
   (assent). This is not mentioned separately by the Heidelberg Catechism,
   because it is virtually included in the knowledge of saving faith. It
   is characteristic of this knowledge that it carries with it a strong
   conviction of the importance of its object, and this is assent. The
   truth grips the soul. (3) An element of the will (trust). This is the
   crowning element of saving faith. It is a personal trust in Christ as
   Saviour and Lord, which includes a surrender of the soul as guilty and
   defiled to Christ, and a reliance on Him as the source of pardon and
   spiritual life. In the last analysis the object of saving faith is
   Jesus Christ and the promise of salvation in Him. John 3:16, 18, 36;
   6:40; Acts 10:43; Rom. 3:22; Gal. 2:16. This faith is not of human
   origin, but is a gift of God, I Cor. 12:8, 9; Gal. 5:22; Eph. 2:8. But
   its exercise is a human activity, to which the children of God are
   repeatedly exhorted, Rom. 10:9; I Cor. 2:5; Col. 1:23; I Tim. 1:5;
   6:11.

   c. The assurance of faith. Methodists maintain that he who believes is
   at once sure that he is a child of God, but that this does not mean
   that he is also certain of ultimate salvation, since he may fall from
   grace. The correct view is that true faith including, as it does, trust
   in God, naturally carries with it a sense of safety and security,
   though this may vary in degree. This assurance is not the permanent
   conscious possession of the believer, He does not ever live the
   full-orbed life of faith, and as a result is not always conscious of
   his spiritual riches. He may be swayed by doubts and uncertainties, and
   is therefore urged to cultivate assurance, II Cor. 13:5; Heb. 6:11; II
   Pet. 1:10; I John 3:19. It can be cultivated by prayer, by meditating
   on the promises of God, and by the development of a truly Christian
   life.

   To memorize. Passages showing:

   a. That God is the author of conversion:
   Acts 11:18. "And when they heard these things, they held their peace,
   and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted
   repentance unto life."

   II Tim. 2:25. "In meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if
   peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the
   truth."

   b. That man co-operates in conversion:

   Isa. 55:7. "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and He will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, and He will abundantly pardon."

   Acts 17:30. "The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now
   He commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent."

   c. The necessity of conversion:
   Ezek. 33:11. "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have
   no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
   his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye
   die, house of Israel?"

   Matt. 18:3. "Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as
   little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

   d. Historical faith:
   Acts 26:27, 28. "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that
   thou believest. And Agrippa said unto Paul, With but little persuasion
   thou wouldest fain make me a Christian."

   Jas. 2:19. "Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well; the demons
   also believe, and shudder."

   e. temporal faith:
   Matt. 13:20, 21. "And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is
   he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; yet
   hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when
   tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he
   stumbleth."

   I John 2:19. "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if
   they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went
   out, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us."

   f. Miraculous faith:
   Matt. 17:20b. "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall
   say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place: and it shall
   remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."

   Acts 14:9, 10. "The same heard Paul speaking: who fastening his eyes
   upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, said with a
   loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked."

   g. Christ as the object of easing faith:
   John 3:16. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
   eternal life." John 6:40. "For this is the will of my Father, that
   every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have
   eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."

   h. The necessity of cultivating assurance:
   Heb. 6:11. "And we desire that each one of you may show the same
   diligence unto the fullness of hope even to the end."

   II Pet. 1:10. "Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make
   your calling and election sure."

   For Further Study:

   a. What kind of repentance is mentioned in Matt. 27:3; II Cor. 7:10b.

   b. Can you name biblical persons in whose lives conversion in the sense
   of an outstanding crisis could hardly be expected? Cf. Jer. 1:4; Luke
   1:5; II Tim. 3:16.

   c. Can you name some of the great words of assurance found in the
   Bible? Cf. Heb. 3:17, 18; II Cor. 4:16 -- 5:1; II Tim. 1:12.

Chapter XXI: Justification

   1. The Nature and Elements of Justification, Justification may be
   defined as that legal act of God by which He declares the sinner
   righteous on the basis of the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ. It
   is not an act or process of renewal, such as regeneration, conversion,
   or sanctification, and does not affect the condition but the-state of
   the sinner. It differs from sanctification in several particulars.
   Justification takes place outside of the sinner in the tribunal of God,
   removes the guilt of sin, and is an act which is complete at once and
   for all time; while sanctification takes place in man, removes the
   pollution of sin, and is a continuous and lifelong process. We
   distinguish two elements in justification, namely: (a) The forgiveness
   of sins on the basis of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. The pardon
   granted applies to all sins, past, present, and future, and therefore
   does not admit of repetition, Ps. 103: 12; Isa. 44:22; Rom. 5:21; 8:1,
   32-34; Heb. 10:14. This does not mean that we need no more pray for
   forgiveness, for the consciousness of guilt remains, creates a feeling
   of separation, and makes it necessary to seek repeatedly the comforting
   assurance of forgiveness, Ps. 25:7; 32:5; 51:1; Matt. 6:12; Jas. 5:15;
   I John 1:9. (b) The adoption as children of God. In justification God
   adopts believers as His children, that is, places them in the position
   of children and gives them all the rights of children, including the
   right to an eternal inheritance, Rom. 8:17; I Pet. 1:4. This legal
   sonship of believers should be distinguished from their moral sonship
   through regeneration and sanctification. Both are indicated in the
   following passages: John 1:12, 13; Rom. 8:15, 16; Gal. 4:5, 6.

   2. The Time of Justification. The word 'justification' is not always
   used in the same sense. Some even speak of a fourfold justification: a
   justification from eternity, a justification in the resurrection of
   Christ, a justification by faith, and a public justification in the
   final judgment. In explanation of this it may be said that in an ideal
   sense the righteousness of Christ is already accounted to believers in
   the counsel of redemption, and therefore from eternity, but this is not
   what the Bible means when it speaks of the justification of the sinner.
   We must distinguish between what was decreed in the eternal counsel of
   God and what is realized in the course of history. Again, there is some
   reason for speaking of a justification in the resurrection of Christ.
   In a sense it may be said that the resurrection was the justification
   of Christ, and that in Him the whole body of believers was justified.
   But this was a general and purely objective transaction, which should
   not be confused with the personal justification of the sinner. When the
   Bible speaks of the justification of the sinner, it usually refers to
   the subjective and personal application and appropriation of the
   justifying grace of God. The usual representation is that we are
   justified by faith. This implies that it takes place at the time when
   we accept Christ by faith. Faith is called the instrument or the
   appropriating organ of justification. By faith man appropriates, that
   is, takes unto himself, the righteousness of Christ, on the basis of
   which he is justified before God. Faith justifies in so far as it takes
   possession of Christ. Rom. 4:5; Gal. 2:16. We should guard against the
   error of the Roman Catholics and the Arminians, that man is justified
   on the basis of his own inherent righteousness, or of his faith. Man's
   own righteousness or faith can never be the ground of his
   justification. This can be found only in the perfect righteousness of
   Jesus Christ, Rom. 3:24; 10:4; II Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:9.

   3. Objections to the Doctrine of Justification. Various objections are
   raised to this doctrine. It is said that, if man is justified on the
   basis of the merits of Christ, he is not saved by grace. But
   justification, with all that it includes, is a gracious work of God.
   The gift of Christ, God's reckoning of His righteousness to us, and His
   dealing with sinners as righteous,-- it is all grace from start to
   finish. Again, it is said to be unworthy of God to declare sinners
   righteous. But God does not declare that they are righteous in
   themselves, but that they are clothed with the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ. And, finally, it is said that this doctrine is apt to make
   people indifferent as to their moral life. If they are justified apart
   from any consideration of works, why should they care for personal
   piety? But justification lays the foundation for a living relationship
   with Christ, and this is the surest guarantee for a truly godly life.
   The man who is really in living union with Christ cannot be morally
   indifferent. Rom. 3:5-8.

   To memorize. Passages speaking of:

   a. Justification in general:
   Rom. 3:24. "Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus."

   II Cor. 5:21. "Him who knew no sin He made to be sin on our behalf;
   that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."

   b. Justification by faith, not by works:
   Rom. 3:28. "We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart
   from the works of the law."

   Rom. 4:5. "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that
   justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness."

   Gal. 2:16. "Yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the
   law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ
   Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the
   works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be
   justified."

   c. Justification and the forgiveness of sins:
   Ps. 32:1, 2. "Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose
   sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah imputeth not
   iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile."

   Acts 13:38, 39. "Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through
   this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins; and by Him every one
   that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be
   justified by the law of Moses."

   d. Adoption of children, heirs of eternal life:
   John 1:12. "But as many as received Him, to them gave He the right to
   become children of God, even to them that believe on His name."

   Gal. 4:4, 5. "But when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth His
   Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that He might redeem them
   that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."

   Rom. 8:17. "And if children, their heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs
   with Christ, if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also
   glorified with Him."

   e. Justification based on the righteousness of Christ:
   Rom. 3:21, 22. "But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath
   been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the
   righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that
   believe."

   Rom. 5:18. "So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all
   men to condemnation; even so though one act of righteousness the free
   gift came unto all men to justification of life."

Chapter XXII: Sanctification and Perseverance

   The doctrine of justification naturally leads on to that of
   sanctification. The state of justification calls for a life of
   sanctification, consecrated to the service of God.

   1. Nature and Characteristics of Sanctification. Sanctification may be
   defined as that gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit by
   which, He purifies the sinner, renews his whole nature in the image of
   God, and enables him to perform good works. It differs from
   justification in that it takes place in the inner life of man, is not a
   legal but a recreative act, is usually a lengthy process, and never
   reaches perfection in this life. While it is very decidedly a
   supernatural work of God, the believer can and should co-operate in it
   by a diligent use of the means which God has placed at his disposal, II
   Cor. 7:1; Col. 3:5-14; I Pet. 1:22. Sanctification does not consist in
   a mere drawing out of what is already given in regeneration, but serves
   to strengthen, to increase, and to fortify the new life. It consists of
   two parts: the gradual removal of the pollution and corruption of human
   nature, Rom. 6:6; Gal. 5:24, and the gradual development of the new
   life in consecration to God, Rom. 6:4, 5; Col. 2:12; 3:1, 2; Gal. 2:19.
   While it takes place in the heart of man, it naturally affects the
   whole life, Rom. 6:12; I Cor. 6:15 20; I Thess. 6:23. The change in the
   inner man is bound to carry with it a change in the outer life. That
   man must co-operate in the work of sanctification follows from the
   repeated warnings against evils and temptations, Rom. 12:9, 16, 17; I
   Cor. 6:9, 10; Gal. 5:16-23, and from the constant exhortations to holy
   living, Micah 6:8; John 15:4- 7; Rom. 8:12, 13; 12:1, 2; Gal. 6:7, 8,
   15.

   2. The Imperfect Character of Sanctification in This Life. While
   sanctification affects every part of man, yet the spiritual development
   of believers remains imperfect in this life. They must contend with sin
   as long as they live, I Kings 8:46; Prov. 20:9; Jas. 3:2; I John 1:8.
   Their lives are characterized by a constant warfare between the flesh
   and the spirit, and even the best of them are still confessing sin, Job
   9:3, 20; Ps. 32:5; 130:3; Prov. 20:9; Isa. 64:6; Dan. 9:7; Rom. 7:14; I
   John 1:9, praying for forgiveness, Ps. 51:1, 2; Dan. 9:16; Matt. 6:12,
   13; Jas. 5:15, and striving for greater perfection, Rom. 7:7-26; Gal.
   5:17; Phil. 3:12-14. This truth is denied by the so-called
   Perfectionists, who maintain that man can reach perfection in this
   life. They appeal to the fact that the Bible commands believers to be
   perfect, Matt. 5:48; I Pet. 1:16; Jas. 1:4, speaks of some as perfect,
   Gen. 6:9; Job 1:8; I Kings 15:14; Phil. 3:15, and declares that they
   who are born of God sin not, I John 3:6, 8, 9; 5:18. But the fact that
   we must strive for perfection does not prove that some are already
   perfect. Moreover, the word 'perfect' does not always mean free from
   sin. Noah, Job, and Asa are called perfect, but history clearly proves
   that they were not without sin. And John evidently means either that
   the new man does not sin, or that believers do not live in sin. He
   himself says that, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
   and the truth is not in us. I John 1:8.

   3. Sanctification and Good Works. Sanctification naturally leads to a
   life of good works. These may be called the fruits of sanctification.
   Good works are not perfect works, but works that spring from the
   principle of love to God or faith in Him, Matt. 7:17, 18; 12:33, 35;
   Heb. 11:6, that are done in conscious conformity to the revealed will
   of God, Deut. 6:2; I Sam. 15:22; Jas. 2:8, and have as their final aim
   the glory of God, I Cor. 10:31; Col. 3:17, 23. Only they who are
   regenerated by the Spirit of God can perform such good works. This does
   not mean, however, that the unregenerate cannot do good in any sense of
   the word. Cf. II Kings 10:29, 30; 12:2; 14:3; Luke 6:33; Rom. 2:14. In
   virtue of the common grace of God they can perform works that are in
   external conformity to the law and serve a laudable purpose; but their
   works are always radically defective, because they are divorced from
   the spiritual root of love to God, represent no real inner obedience to
   the law of God, and do not aim at the glory of God. In opposition to
   the Roman Catholics it should be maintained that the good works of
   believers are not meritorious, Luke 17:9, 10; Eph. 2:8-10; Tit. 3:5,
   though God promises to reward them with a reward of free grace, I Cor.
   3:14; Heb. 11:26; and in opposition to the Antinomians the necessity of
   good works must be asserted, Col. 1:10; II Tim. 2:21; Tit. 2:14; Heb.
   10:24.

   4. Perseverance of the Saints. The expression 'perseverance of the
   saints' naturally suggests a continuous activity of believers whereby
   they persevere in the way of salvation. As a matter of fact, however,
   the perseverance referred to is less an activity of believers than a
   work of God, in which believers must participate. Strictly speaking,
   the assurance of man's salvation lies in the fact that God perseveres.
   Perseverance may be defined as that continuous operation of the Holy
   Spirit in the believer, by which the work of divine grace that is begun
   in the heart, is continued and brought to completion. This doctrine is
   clearly taught in Scripture, John 10:28, 29; Rom. 11:29; Phil. 1:6; II
   Thess. 3:3; II Tim. 1:12; 4:18. And it is only when we believe in this
   perseverance of God that we can in this life attain to the assurance of
   salvation, Heb. 3:14; 6:11; 10:22; II Pet. 1:10. Outside of Reformed
   circles this doctrine finds no favor. It is said to be contradicted by
   Scripture, which warns against apostasy, Heb. 2:1; 10:26, exhorts
   believers to continue in the way of salvation, Matt. 24:13; Col. 1:23;
   Heb. 3:14, and even records cases of apostasy, I Tim. 1:19, 20; II Tim.
   2:17, 18; 4:10. Such warnings and exhortations would seem to assume the
   possibility of falling away, and such cases would seem to prove it
   completely. But as a matter of fact the warnings and exhortations prove
   only that God works mediately and wants man to co-operate in the work
   of perseverance: and there is no proof that the apostates mentioned
   were real believers. Cf. Rom. 9:6; I John 2:19; Rev. 3:1.

   To memorize: Passages to prove:
    1. Sanctification as a work of God:
       I Thess. 5:23. "And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly;
       and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without
       blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
       Heb. 2:11. "For both He that sanetifieth and they that are
       sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to
       call them brethren."
    2. Man's co-operation in sanctification:
       II Cor. 7:1. "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us
       cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit,
       perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
       Heb. 12:14. "Follow after peace with all men, and the
       sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord."
    3. The mortification of the old man:
       Rom. 6:6. "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him,
       that the body of sin might be done away, so that we should no
       longer be in bondage to sin."
       Gal. 6:24: "And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the
       flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof."
    4. The quickening of the new man:
       Eph. 4:24. "And put on the new man, that after God hath been
       created in righteousness and holiness of truth."
       Col. 3:10. "And have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto
       knowledge after the image of Him that created him."
    5. Sanctification incomplete in this life:
       Rom. 7:18. "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth
       no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which
       is good is not."
       Phil. 3:12. "Not that I have already obtained, or am already made
       perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for
       which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus."
    6. The nature of good works:
       I Sam. 15:22. "And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in
       burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?
       Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the
       fat of rams."
       I Cor. 10:31. "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye
       do, do all to the glory of God."
       Heb. 11:6. "And without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing
       to Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that
       He is a rewarder of them that seek after Him."
    7. Perseverance of the saints:

   John 10:28, 29. "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall
   never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father,
   who hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to
   snatch them out of my Father's hand."

   II Tim. 1:12. "For which cause I suffer also these things: yet am I not
   ashamed; for I know Him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that
   He is able to guard that which I have committed unto Him against that
   day."

   II Tim. 4:18. "The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will
   save me unto His heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and
   ever."

   For Further Study:

   complete sanctification? Phil. 3:21; Heb. 12:23; Rev. 14:5; 21:27?

   b. What parts of man does sanctification affect according to Jer.
   31:34; Phil. 2:13; Gal. 5:24; Heb. 9:14? c. What does the word
   'perfect' (cf. Auth. Ver.) mean in the following passages: I Cor. 2:6;
   3:1, 2; Heb. 5:14; II Tim. 3:16?
