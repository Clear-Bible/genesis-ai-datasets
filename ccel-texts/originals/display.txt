   or

   A Display of Arminianism:

   being

   a discovery of the old Pelagian idol free-will, with the new goddess
   contingency,

   advancing themselves into the throne of the God of heaven, to the
   prejudice of his grace, providence, and supreme dominion over the
   children of men;

   wherein

   the main errors by which they are fallen off from the received doctrine
   of all the Reformed churches, with their opposition in divers
   particulars to the doctrine established in the Church of England, are
   discovered and laid open out of their own writings and confessions, and
   confuted by the word of God.

                                Prefatory note.

   The relation of man to his Creator has engaged the attention of earnest
   and thoughtful minds, from the days of the patriarch of Uz to the most
   recent controversies of modern times. The entrance of sin into the
   world has vastly complicated this relationship; so that, considered in
   its various bearings, it involves some of the most difficult problems
   with which the human intellect has ever attempted to grapple. The
   extent to which the intellect itself has been weakened and beclouded by
   the corruption of our nature, renders us the less able to penetrate
   into the deep mysteries of human duty and destiny. Whether man sins now
   as essentially affected with the taint of the first sin, and involved
   in the responsibilities of the first sinner, or sins wholly on his own
   account and by his own free act, under the bias of no connection with
   Adam, except what connection obtains between example on the one hand
   and imitation on the other? whether, on the supposition of a scheme of
   saving grace, grace is simply divine and external aid to the will of
   man, already operating freely in the direction of what is good, and so
   establishing a meritorious claim upon God for the bestowal of such aid,
   or a supernatural influence creating in man the very liberty itself to
   will and to do what is good? and whether, in the latter view of divine
   grace, as bestowed in divine sovereignty, and therefore according to a
   divine purpose, it can be reconciled with human responsibility? -- are
   the questions which produced the sharp encounter of keen and
   conflicting wits between Pelagius and Augustine of old.

   Towards the middle of the ninth century, these questions again assumed
   distinctive prominence in the history of theological speculation.
   Gottschalc, a monk of Orbais, distinguished himself by his advocacy of
   the doctrines of Augustine. It was the doctrine of predestination
   chiefly on which he insisted; and the controversy in his hands assumed
   this peculiar modification, that not merely the application of gracious
   influence, but the reference of the atonement, was exhibited as under
   the limit and regulation of the divine sovereignty and purpose. Not
   that in this respect he was at variance with Augustine, but the point
   seems to have been specially and formally mooted in the discussions of
   this age. His view of predestination embraced an element which may be
   reckoned an advance on the Augustinian doctrine; for according to him,
   predestination was twofold, comprehending the punishment of the
   reprobate as well as the salvation of the elect; but while he held the
   predestination of men to the punishment of their sin, he was far from
   holding, as his opponents alleged, that they were predestinated to the
   commission of sin. Council warred with council in the case of
   Gottschalc. Gottschalc himself expiated by a death in prison his
   audacious anticipation of the rights of private judgment and free
   inquiry in a dark age.

   The next revival of the same controversy in substance, though under
   certain modifications, took place after the Reformation. It is
   remarkable that at this period discussion on these weighty questions
   sprang up almost simultaneously in three different parts of Europe, and
   in three schools of theology, among which a wide diversity existed. The
   shackles of mediæval ignorance were burst asunder by the awakening
   intelligence of Europe; and if we except the controversy between
   Protestantism and Popery, on which the Reformation hinged, no point
   could more naturally engage the mind, in the infancy of its freedom,
   than the compatibility of the divine purpose with human responsibility;
   on the solution of which problem the nature of redemption seemed to
   depend, and around which, by the spell of the very mystery attaching to
   it, human speculation in all ages had revolved. When an interdict still
   lay on theological inquiry, Thomists and Scotists had discussed it in
   its metaphysical form, and under a cloud of scholastic subtleties, lest
   the jealousies of a dominant church should be awakened. But now, when a
   measure of intellectual freedom had been acquired, and the dispute
   between free-will on the one hand and efficacious grace on the other
   involved a practical issue between Rome and Geneva, the question
   received a treatment almost exclusively theological.

   First, perhaps, in the order of time, this discussion was revived in
   Poland, and in connection with the heresies of Socinus. The divinity of
   Christ, the nature of the atonement, and the corruption of human
   nature, are all doctrines essentially connected. It is because Christ
   is divine that an adequate satisfaction has been rendered, in his
   sufferings, to the claims of divine justice; and such an atonement is
   indispensable for our salvation, if man, because dead in sin, has no
   power to achieve salvation by any merit of his own. A denial of the
   total corruption of our nature seems essential to the Unitarian system;
   so far there is common ground between the systems of Pelagius and
   Socinus. It is not wonderful that this measure of identity should
   develop consequences affecting the doctrine of the divine purposes and
   of predestination though it is beyond our limits to trace either the
   necessary or the historical evolution of these consequences. Spanheim,
   in his "Elenchus Controversiarum," p. 237, ascribes the origin of the
   Arminian controversy in Holland to certain emissaries, Ostorodius and
   Voidovius, dispatched by the Polish Socinians into the Low Countries,
   for the purpose of propagating the tenets of their sect. Their tenets
   respecting the Trinity and the atonement took no root in these
   countries; but Spanheim affirms that it was otherwise in regard to
   certain opinions of Socinus, "quæ ille recoxit ex Pelagii disciplinâ,"
   on predestination, free-will, and the ground of justification before
   God.

   About the same time, the Church of Rome was shaken to its centre by the
   same controversy. The Jesuits had always Pelagian leanings, and in the
   Council of Trent their influence was triumphant, and, so far as its
   decrees stereotype the Romish creed, sealed the doom of the waning
   authority of Augustine. Louis Molina, in 1588, made an attempt in his
   lectures on "The Concord of Grace and Free-will " to unite the
   conflicting theories. The Jesuits regarded his attempt with no small
   favour. A lengthened controversy arose, in which Molinism, as partly a
   deviation from, and partly a compromise of, the fundamental principles
   of the Augustinian system, was effectually assailed by the piety of
   Jansen, the learning of Arnauld, and the genius of Pascal, till the
   bull Unigenitus secured a lasting triumph for Jesuitism, by the
   authoritative condemnation of the doctrines of Augustine, as declared
   in the collection of extracts from his writings which Jansen had
   published under the title "Augustinus."

   But it was in Holland that the controversy on this point arose which
   had the chief influence on British theology, and reduced the questions
   at issue to the shape under which they are discussed by Owen in his
   "Display of Arminianism." On the death of an eminent theologian of the
   name of Junius, Arminius was called to the vacant chair in the
   University of Leyden. Gomar, a professor in the same university, and
   the Presbytery of Amsterdam, opposed his appointment on the ground of
   his erroneous principles. On giving a pledge that he would teach
   nothing at variance with the Belgic Confession and Catechism, he was
   allowed to enter on his office as professor in 1603. Gomar and he again
   fell into a dispute on the subject of predestination, -- the origin of
   prolonged troubles and controversies in the Church of Holland. Gomar
   and his party were supported by the majority of the clergy in the
   church. Arminius depended upon the political support of the state. The
   former sought a national synod to adjudicate on the prevailing
   controversy. The latter, having the ear of the state, contrived to
   prevent it. Stormy scenes ensued, amid which Arminius died, and
   Episcopius became the leader of the Remonstrants, as his followers were
   called, from a remonstrance which they submitted in 1610 to the States
   of Holland and West Friesland. The Remonstrants levied soldiers to
   sustain their cause, and the provinces resounded with military
   preparations. At last, profiting by the confusion, Maurice, the head of
   the house of Orange, by a series of daring and reckless movements,
   seized upon the government of the States. In deference to Gomar and his
   party, he convened a general synod on the 13th November 1618. The
   doctrines of Arminius were condemned, and five articles were drawn up
   and published as the judgment of the synod on the points in dispute.
   The first asserts election by grace, in opposition to election on the
   ground of foreseen excellence; in the second God is declared to have
   willed that Christ should efficaciously redeem all those, and those
   only, who from eternity were chosen to salvation; the third and fourth
   relate to the moral impotence of man, and the work of the Spirit in
   conversion; and the fifth affirms the doctrine of the perseverance of
   the saints. The Church of France embodied these articles among her own
   standards. The Church of Geneva as cordially acquiesced in them.

   Four English deputies, Drs Carleton, Hall, Davenant, and Ward, together
   with Dr Balcanquhal from Scotland, by the command of James VI.,
   repaired to Holland, and took their place in the Synod of Dort, in
   accordance with a request of the Dutch Church to be favoured with the
   aid and countenance of some delegates from the British Churches. The
   proceedings of the Synod of Dort had the sanction of these British
   divines. No doubt can be entertained that the Thirty-nine Articles of
   the Church of England were not Arminian; but on the elevation of Laud
   to the see of Canterbury, Arminianism grew strong within its pale. A
   royal prohibition was issued against all discussion of the controverted
   points in the pulpit. All ecclesiastical preferments at the disposal of
   the Crown were bestowed on those who leaned to Arminian views. "The
   fates of our church," says Owen, in the note to the reader prefixed to
   the following treatise, "having of late devolved the government thereof
   into the hands of men tainted with this poison, Arminianism became
   backed with the powerful arguments of praise and preferment, and
   quickly prevailed to beat poor naked truth into a corner." It would,
   however, be neither fair nor correct if the statement of these facts
   left an impression that Arminianism made progress solely through the
   help of royal and prelatic favour. It was embraced and supported by
   some authors to whom no sinister motives can be imputed; and the cause
   has never found an abler advocate than John Goodwin whose name, for his
   publications against the royal interest, was associated with that of
   Milton in the legal proceedings instituted against them both at the
   Restoration.

   At this juncture, Owen felt it his duty to oppose the innovations on
   the received doctrine of the church, by the publication of a work in
   which the views of the Arminians are exhibited on all the leading
   topics of the controversy, with the exception of three points, relating
   to universal grace, justification, and the perseverance of the saints.
   He substantiates his statements regarding the Arminian tenets by
   copious quotations from the works of the Dutch Remonstrants; and
   contrasts them, at the close of each chapter, with passages from
   Scripture. Exception may be taken to this course, as the sentence of
   any author, detached from the context, may convey a meaning which is
   essentially modified by it. Some of these quotations are so far
   accommodated by Owen as to present a full statement of a particular
   opinion, instead of appearing in the parenthetic and incidental form
   which they present in the original works, as merely parts of a
   sentence. We did not feel it needful to interfere with them in this
   shape; for, so far as we can judge, our author evinces perfect
   integrity in all the quotations to which he has recourse, and the
   slight alterations occasionally made on them never superinduce a
   dishonest or mistaken gloss on the views of the authors from whom the
   passages are selected. It may be questioned if Owen sufficiently
   discriminates the doctrine of Arminius from the full development which
   his system, after his death, received in the hands of his followers.
   Sometimes, moreover, opinions possessing the distinctive features of
   Pelagianism are confounded with Arminianism, strictly so called. Our
   author, perhaps, may be vindicated on the ground that it was his object
   to exhibit Arminianism as current and common in his day; and his
   quotations seem to prove that his Display of it was not far from the
   truth, though, from the refinement of modern discrimination on some of
   the points, many an Arminian would hardly subscribe to some of the
   statements as a correct representation of his creed, and a Calvinistic
   author is under obvious temptation to run up Arminian views into what
   he may esteem their legitimate consequences in the extravagance of the
   Pelagian theory. The style is simple; some polish appears in the
   composition; and occasionally a degree of ornament and pleasantry is
   employed (as when he enters on the question of Free-will, chap. xii.),
   which is rare with Owen, who perhaps prided himself on the studious
   rejection of literary elegance. It could be wished that he had risen
   superior to the vice of the age in such discussions, by manifesting
   less acerbity of temper and diction in the refutation of the views
   which he combats in this work. It was Owen's first publication (1642),
   and immediately brought him into notice. The living of Fordham in Essex
   was conferred upon him by the Committee of Religion, to whom the work
   is dedicated. -- Ed.

 To the right honourable the lords and gentlemen of the committee for religion.
                                      [1]

   The many ample testimonies of zealous reverence to the providence of
   God, as well as affectionate care for the privileges of men, which have
   been given by this honourable assembly of parliament, encourage the
   adorers of the one, no less than the lovers of the other, to vindicate
   that also from the encroachments of men. And as it was not, doubtless,
   without divine disposition that those should be the chiefest agents in
   robbing men of their privileges who had nefariously attempted to spoil
   God of his providence; so we hope the same all-ruling hand hath
   disposed of them to be glorious instruments of re-advancing his right
   and supreme dominion over the hearts of men whose hearts he hath
   prepared with courage and constancy to establish men in their
   inviolated rights, by reducing a sweet harmony between awful
   sovereignty and a well-moderated liberty. Now, the first of these being
   demandated to your particular care, I come unto you with a bill of
   complaint against no small number in this kingdom, who have wickedly
   violated our interest in the providence of God, and have attempted to
   bring in the foreign power of an old idol, to the great prejudice of
   all the true subjects and servants of the Most High. My accusation I
   make good by the evidence of the fact, joined with their own
   confessions. And because, to waive the imputation of violent intrusion
   into the dominion of another, they lay some claim and pretend some
   title unto it, I shall briefly show how it is contrary to the express
   terms of the great charter of Heaven to have any such power introduced
   amongst men. Your known love to truth and the gospel of Christ makes it
   altogether needless for me to stir you up by any motives to hearken to
   this just complaint, and provide a timely remedy for this growing evil;
   especially since experience hath so clearly taught us here, in England,
   that not only eternal but temporal happiness also dependeth on the
   flourishing of the truth of Christ's gospel.

   Justice and religion were always conceived as the main columns and
   upholders of any state or commonwealth; like two pillars in a building,
   whereof the one cannot stand without the other, nor the whole fabric
   without them both. As the philosopher spake of logic and rhetoric, they
   are artes antistrophai, mutually aiding each other, and both aiming at
   the same end, though in different manners; so they, without repugnancy,
   concur and sweetly fall in one with another, for the reiglement and
   direction of every person in a commonwealth, to make the whole happy
   and blessed: and where they are both thus united, there, and only
   there, is the blessing in assurance whereof Hezekiah rejoiced, -- truth
   and peace. An agreement without truth is no peace, but a covenant with
   death, a league with hell, a conspiracy against the kingdom of Christ,
   a stout rebellion against the God of heaven; and without justice, great
   commonwealths are but great troops of robbers. Now, the result of the
   one of these is civil peace; of the other, ecclesiastical: betwixt
   which two there is a great sympathy, a strict connection, having on
   each other a mutual dependence. Is there any disturbance of the state?
   it is usually attended with schisms and factions in the church; and the
   divisions of the church are too often even the subversions of the
   commonwealth. Thus it hath been ever since that unhappy difference
   between Cain and Abel; which was not concerning the bounds and limits
   of their inheritance, nor which of them should be heir to the whole
   world, but about the dictates of religion, the offering of their
   sacrifices. This fire, also, of dissension hath been more stirred up
   since the Prince of Peace hath, by his gospel, sent the sword amongst
   us; for the preaching thereof, meeting with the strongholds of Satan
   and the depraved corruption of human nature, must needs occasion a
   great shaking of the earth. But most especially, distracted Christendom
   hath found fearful issues of this discord, since the proud Romish
   prelates have sought to establish their hell-broached errors, by
   inventing and maintaining uncharitable, destructive censures against
   all that oppose them: which, first causing schisms and distractions in
   the church, and then being helped forward by the blindness and cruelty
   of ambitious potentates, have raised war of nation against nation, --
   witness the Spanish invasion of '88; [2] [and war] of a people within
   themselves, as in the late civil wars of France, where, after divers
   horrible massacres, many chose rather to die soldiers than martyrs.

   And, oh, that this truth might not, at this day, be written with the
   blood of almost expiring Ireland! Yea, it hath lastly descended to
   dissension betwixt private parties, -- witness the horrible murder of
   Diazius, whose brains were chopped out with an axe by his own brother
   Alphonsus, [3] for forsaking the Romish religion; what rents in [the]
   State, what grudgings, hatreds, and exasperations of mind among private
   men, have happened by reason of some inferior differences, we all at
   this day grieve to behold. "Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum!"
   Most concerning, then, is it for us to endeavour obedience to our
   Saviour's precept, of seeking first the kingdom of God, that we may be
   partakers of the good things comprised in the promise annexed. Were
   there but this one argument for to seek the peace of the church,
   because thereon depends the peace of the commonwealth, it were
   sufficient to quicken our utmost industry for the attaining of it. Now,
   what peace in the church without truth? All conformity to anything else
   is but the agreement of Herod and Pilate to destroy Christ and his
   kingdom. Neither is it this or that particular truth, but the whole
   counsel of God revealed unto us, without adding or detracting, whose
   embracement is required to make our peace firm and stable. No halting
   betwixt Jehovah and Baal, Christ and Antichrist; as good be all
   Philistine, and worshippers of Dagon, as to speak part the language of
   Ashdod and part the language of the Jews: hence, hence hath been the
   rise of all our miseries, of all our dissensions, whilst factious men
   laboured every day to commend themselves to them who sat aloft in the
   temple of God, by introducing new popish-arminian errors, whose
   patronage they had wickedly undertaken. Who would have thought that our
   church would ever have given entertainment to these Belgic
   semi-Pelagians, who have cast dirt upon the faces and raked up the
   ashes of all those great and pious souls whom God magnified, in using
   as his instruments to reform his church; to the least of which the
   whole troop of Arminians shall never make themselves equal, though they
   swell till they break? What benefit did ever come to this church by
   attempting to prove that the chief part in the several degrees of our
   salvation is to be ascribed unto ourselves, rather than God? -- which
   is the head and sum of all the controversies between them and us. And
   must not the introducing and fomenting of a doctrine so opposite to
   that truth our church hath quietly enjoyed ever since the first
   Reformation necessarily bring along with it schisms and dissensions, so
   long as any remain who love the truth, or esteem the gospel above
   preferment? Neither let any deceive your wisdoms, by affirming that
   they are differences of an inferior nature that are at this day
   agitated between the Arminians and the orthodox divines of the reformed
   church. Be pleased but to cast an eye on the following instances, and
   you will find them hewing at the very root of Christianity. Consider
   seriously their denying of that fundamental article of original sin. Is
   this but a small escape in theology? -- why, what need of the gospel,
   what need of Christ himself, if our nature be not guilty, depraved,
   corrupted? Neither are many of the rest of less importance. Surely
   these are not things "in quibus possimus dissentire salvâ pace ac
   charitate," as Austin speaks, -- "about which we may differ without
   loss of peace or charity." One church cannot wrap in her communion
   Austin and Pelagius, Calvin and Arminius. I have here only given you a
   taste, whereby you may judge of the rest of their fruit, -- "mors in
   olla, mors in olla;" their doctrine of the final apostasy of the elect,
   of true believers, of a wavering hesitancy concerning our present grace
   and future glory, with divers others, I have wholly omitted: those I
   have produced are enough to make their abettors incapable of our
   church-communion. The sacred bond of peace compasseth only the unity of
   that Spirit; which leadeth into all truth. We must not offer the right
   hand of fellowship, but rather proclaim hieron polemon, [4] "a holy
   war," to such enemies of God's providence, Christ's merit, and the
   powerful operation of the Holy Spirit. Neither let any object, that all
   the Arminians do not openly profess all these errors I have recounted.
   Let ours, then, show wherein they differ from their masters. [5] We see
   their own confessions; we know their arts, bathe kai methodeias tou
   Satana, -- "the depths and crafts of Satan;" we know the several ways
   they have to introduce and insinuate their heterodoxies into the minds
   of men. With some they appear only to dislike our doctrine of
   reprobation; with others, to claim an allowable liberty of the will:
   but yet, for the most part, -- like the serpent, wherever she gets in
   her head, she will wriggle in her whole body, sting and all, -- give
   but the least admission, and the whole poison must be swallowed. What
   was the intention of the maintainers of these strange assertions
   amongst us I know not, -- whether the efficacy of error prevailed
   really with them or no, or whether it were the better to comply with
   Popery, and thereby to draw us back again unto Egypt; -- but this I
   have heard, that it was affirmed on knowledge, in a former parliament,
   that the introduction of Arminianism amongst us was the issue of a
   Spanish consultation. It is a strange story that learned Zanchius [6]
   tells us, how, upon the death of the Cardinal of Lorraine there was
   found in his study a note of the names of divers German doctors and
   ministers, being Lutherans, to whom was paid an annual pension, by the
   assignment of the cardinal, that they might take pains to oppose the
   Calvinists; and so, by cherishing dissension, reduce the people again
   to Popery. If there be any such amongst us, who, upon such poor
   inconsiderable motives, would be won to betray the gospel of Christ,
   God grant them repentance before it be too late! However, upon what
   grounds, with what intentions, for what ends soever, these tares have
   been sowed amongst us by envious men, the hope of all the piously
   learned in the kingdom is, that, by your effectual care and diligence,
   some means may be found to root them out. Now, God Almighty increase
   and fill your whole honourable society with wisdom, zeal, knowledge,
   and all other Christian graces, necessary for your great calling and
   employments; which is the daily prayer, of your most humble and devoted
   servant,

   John Owen.

                            To the Christian reader.

   Reader, -- Thou canst not be such a stranger in our Israel as that it
   should be necessary for me to acquaint thee with the first sowing and
   spreading of these tares in the field of the church, much less to
   declare what divisions and thoughts of heart, what open bitter
   contentions, to the loss of ecclesiastical peace, have been stirred up
   amongst us about them. Only some few things, relating to this my
   particular endeavour, I would willingly premonish thee of:--

   First, Never were so many prodigious errors introduced into a church,
   with so high a hand and so little opposition, as these into ours, since
   the nation of Christians was known in the world. The chief cause I take
   to be that which Æneas Sylvius gave why more maintained the pope to be
   above the council than the council above the pope, -- because popes
   gave archbishoprics, bishoprics, etc., but the councils sued "in forma
   pauperis," and, therefore, could scarce get an advocate to plead their
   cause. The fates of our church having of late devolved the government
   thereof into the hands of men tainted with this poison, Arminianism
   became backed with the powerful arguments of praise and preferment, and
   quickly prevailed to beat poor naked Truth into a corner. It is high
   time, then, for all the lovers of the old way to oppose this
   innovation, prevailing by such unworthy means, before our breach grow
   great like the sea, and there be none to heal it.

   My intention in this weak endeavour (which is but the undigested issue
   of a few broken hours, too many causes, in these furious malignant
   days, continually interrupting the course of my studies), is but to
   stir up such who, having more leisure and greater abilities, will not
   as yet move a finger to help [to] vindicate oppressed truth.

   In the meantime, I hope this discovery may not be unuseful, especially
   to such who, wanting either will or abilities to peruse larger
   discourses, may yet be allured by their words, which are smoother than
   oil, to taste the poison of asps that is under their lips. Satan hath
   bathe kai methodeias, depths where to hide, and methods how to broach
   his lies; and never did any of his emissaries employ his received
   talents with more skill and diligence than our Arminians, labouring
   earnestly, in the first place, to instill some errors that are most
   plausible, intending chiefly an introduction of them that are more
   palpable, knowing that if those be for a time suppressed until these be
   well digested, they will follow of their own accord. Wherefore, I have
   endeavoured to lay open to the view of all some of their
   foundation-errors, not usually discussed, on which the whole
   inconsistent superstructure is erected, whereby it will appear how,
   under a most vain pretense of farthering piety, they have prevaricated
   against the very grounds of Christianity; wherein, --

   First, I have not observed the same method in handling each particular
   controversy, but followed such several ways as seemed most convenient
   to clear the truth and discover their heresies.

   Secondly, Some of their errors I have not touched at all, -- as those
   concerning universal grace, justification, the final apostasy of true
   believers, -- because they came not within the compass of my proposed
   method, as you may see chap. i., where you have the sum of the whole
   discourse.

   Thirdly, I have given some instances of their opposing the received
   doctrine of the church of England, contained in divers of the
   Thirty-nine Articles; which would it did not yield us just cause of
   farther complaint against the iniquity of those times whereinto we were
   lately fallen! Had a poor Puritan offended against half so many canons
   as they opposed articles, he had forfeited his livelihood, if not
   endangered his life. I would I could hear any other probable reason why
   divers prelates were so zealous for the discipline and so negligent of
   the doctrine of the church, but because the one was reformed by the
   word of God, the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery.

   Fourthly, I have not purposely undertaken to answer any of their
   arguments, referring that labour to a farther design, even a clearing
   of our doctrine of reprobation, and of the administration of God's
   providence towards the reprobates, and over all their actions, from
   those calumnious aspersions they cast upon it; but concerning this, I
   fear the discouragements of these woeful days will leave me nothing but
   a desire that so necessary a work may find a more able pen.

                                   Chapter I.

   Of the two main ends aimed at by the Arminians, by their innovations in
   the received doctrine of the reformed churches.

   The soul of man, by reason of the corruption of nature, is not only
   darkened [7] with a mist of ignorance, whereby he is disenabled for the
   comprehending of divine truth, but is also armed with prejudice and
   opposition against some parts thereof, [8] which are either most above
   or most contrary to some false principles which he hath framed unto
   himself. As a desire of self-sufficiency was the first cause of this
   infirmity, so a conceit thereof is that wherewith he still languisheth;
   nothing doth he more contend for than an independency of any supreme
   power, which might either help, hinder, or control him in his actions.
   This is that bitter root from whence have sprung all those heresies [9]
   and wretched contentions which have troubled the church, concerning the
   power of man in working his own happiness, and his exemption from the
   over-ruling providence of Almighty God. All which wrangling disputes of
   carnal reason against the word of God come at last to this head,
   Whether the first, and chiefest part, in disposing of things in this
   world, ought to be ascribed to God or man? Men for the most part have
   vindicated this pre-eminence unto themselves, [10] by exclamations that
   so it must be, or else that God is unjust, and his ways unequal. Never
   did any men, "postquam Christiana gens esse cæpit," more eagerly
   endeavour the erecting of this Babel than the Arminians, the modern
   blinded patrons of human self-sufficiency; all whose innovations in the
   received doctrine of the reformed churches aim at and tend to one of
   these two ends:--

   First, To exempt themselves from God's jurisdiction, -- to free
   themselves from the supreme dominion of his all-ruling providence; not
   to live and move in him, but to have an absolute independent power in
   all their actions, so that the event of all things wherein they have
   any interest might have a considerable relation to nothing but chance,
   contingency, and their own wills; -- a most nefarious, sacrilegious
   attempt! To this end, --

   First, They deny the eternity and unchangeableness of God's decrees;
   for these being established, they fear they should be kept within
   bounds from doing any thing but what his counsel hath determined should
   be done. If the purposes of the Strength of Israel be eternal and
   immutable, their idol free-will must be limited, their independency
   prejudiced; wherefore they choose rather to affirm that his decrees are
   temporary and changeable, yea, that he doth really change them
   according to the several mutations he sees in us: which, how wild a
   conceit it is, how contrary to the pure nature of God, how destructive
   to his attributes, I shall show in the second chapter.

   Secondly, They question the prescience or foreknowledge of God; for if
   known unto God are all his works from the beginning, if he certainly
   foreknew all things that shall hereafter come to pass, it seems to cast
   an infallibility of event upon all their actions, which encroaches upon
   the large territory of their new goddess, contingency; nay, it would
   quite dethrone the queen of heaven, and induce a kind of necessity of
   our doing all, and nothing but what God foreknows. Now, that to deny
   this prescience is destructive to the very essence of the Deity, and
   plain atheism, shall be declared, chapter the third.

   Thirdly, They depose the all-governing providence of this King of
   nations, denying its energetical, effectual power, in turning the
   hearts, ruling the thoughts, determining the wills, and disposing the
   actions of men, by granting nothing unto it but a general power and
   influence, to be limited and used according to the inclination and will
   of every particular agent; so making Almighty God a desirer that many
   things were otherwise than they are, and an idle spectator of most
   things that are done in the world: the falseness of which assertions
   shall be proved, chapter the fourth.

   Fourthly, They deny the irresistibility and uncontrollable power of
   God's will, affirming that oftentimes he seriously willeth and
   intendeth what he cannot accomplish, and so is deceived of his aim;
   nay, whereas he desireth, and really intendeth, to save every man, it
   is wholly in their own power whether he shall save any one or no;
   otherwise their idol free-will should have but a poor deity, if God
   could, how and when he would, cross and resist him in his dominion.
   Concerning this see chapter the fifth. "His gradibus itur in coelum."
   Corrupted nature is still ready, either nefariously, with Adam, to
   attempt to be like God, or to think foolishly that he is altogether
   like unto us, Ps. l.; one of which inconveniences all men run into, who
   have not learned to submit their frail wills to the almighty will of
   God, and captivate their understandings to the obedience of faith. [See
   chapter fifth.]

   Secondly, The second end at which the new doctrine of the Arminians
   aimeth is, to clear human nature from the heavy imputation of being
   sinful, corrupted, wise to do evil but unable to do good; and so to
   vindicate unto themselves a power and ability of doing all that good
   which God can justly require to be done by them in the state wherein
   they are, -- of making themselves differ from others who will not make
   so good use of the endowments of their natures; that so the first and
   chiefest part in the work of their salvation may be ascribed unto
   themselves; -- a proud Luciferian endeavour! To this end, --

   First, They deny that doctrine of predestination whereby God is
   affirmed to have chosen certain men before the foundation of the world,
   that they should be holy, and obtain everlasting life by the merit of
   Christ, to the praise of his glorious grace, -- any such predestination
   which may be the fountain and cause of grace or glory, determining the
   persons, according to God's good pleasure, on whom they shall be
   bestowed: for this doctrine would make the special grace of God to be
   the sole cause of all the good that is in the elect more than [in] the
   reprobates; would make faith the work and gift of God, with divers
   other things, which would show their idol to be nothing, of no value.
   Wherefore, what a corrupt heresy they have substituted into the place
   hereof see chapter the sixth.

   Secondly, They deny original sin and its demerit; which being rightly
   understood, would easily demonstrate that, notwithstanding all the
   labour of the smith, the carpenter, and the painter, yet their idol is
   of its own nature but an unprofitable block; it will discover not only
   the impotency of doing good which is in our nature, but show also
   whence we have it: see chapter the seventh.

   Thirdly, If ye will charge our human nature with a repugnancy to the
   law of God, they will maintain that it was also in Adam when he was
   first created, and so comes from God himself: chapter the eighth.

   Fourthly, They deny the efficacy of the merit of the death of Christ;
   -- both that God intended by his death to redeem his church, or to
   acquire unto himself a holy people; as also, that Christ by his death
   hath merited and procured for us grace, faith, or righteousness, and
   power to obey God, in fulfilling the condition of the new covenant.
   Nay, this were plainly to set up an ark to break their Dagon's neck;
   for, "what praise," say they, "can be due to ourselves for believing,
   if the blood of Christ hath procured God to bestow faith upon us?"
   "Increpet te Deus, O Satan!" See chapters nine and ten.

   Fifthly, If Christ will claim such a share in saving of his people, of
   them that believe in him, they will grant some to have salvation quite
   without him, that never heard so much as a report of a Saviour; and,
   indeed, in nothing do they advance their idol nearer the throne of God
   than in this blasphemy: chapter eleven.

   Sixthly, Having thus robbed God, Christ, and his grace, they adorn
   their idol free-will with many glorious properties no way due unto it:
   discussed, chapter twelve, where you shall find how, "movet cornicula
   risum, furtivis nudata coloribus."

   Seventhly, They do not only claim to their new-made deity a saving
   power, but also affirm that he is very active and operative in the
   great work of saving our souls, --

   First, In fitly preparing us for the grace of God, and so disposing of
   ourselves that it becomes due unto us: chapter thirteen.

   Secondly, In the effectual working of our conversion together with it:
   chapter fourteen.

   And so at length, with much toil and labour, they have placed an altar
   for their idol in the holy temple, on the right hand of the altar of
   God, and on it offer sacrifice to their own net and drag; at least,
   "nec Deo, nec libero arbitrio, sed dividatur," -- not all to God, nor
   all to free-will, but let the sacrifice of praise, for all good things,
   be divided between them.

   Of the eternity and immutability of the decrees of almighty God, denied
   and overthrown by the Arminians.

   It hath been always believed among Christians, and that upon infallible
   grounds, as I shall show hereafter, that all the decrees of God, as
   they are internal, so they are eternal, acts of his will; and therefore
   unchangeable and irrevocable. Mutable decrees and occasional
   resolutions are most contrary to the pure nature of Almighty God. Such
   principles as these, evident and clear by their own light, were never
   questioned by any before the Arminians began akineta kinein, and to
   profess themselves to delight in opposing common notions of reason
   concerning God and his essence, that they might exalt themselves into
   his throne. To ascribe the least mutability to the divine essence, with
   which all the attributes and internal free acts of God are one and the
   same, was ever accounted huperbole apheotetos, "transcendent atheism,"
   in the highest degree. [11] Now, be this crime of what nature it will,
   it is no unjust imputation to charge it on the Arminians, because they
   confess themselves guilty, and glory in the crime.

   First, They undermine and overthrow the eternity of God's purposes, by
   affirming that, in the order of the divine decrees, there are some
   which precede every act of the creature, and some again that follow
   them: so Corvinus, [12] the most famous of that sect. Now, all the acts
   of every creature being but of yesterday, temporary, like themselves,
   surely, those decrees of God cannot be eternal which follow them in
   order of time; and yet they press this, especially in respect of human
   actions, as a certain, unquestionable verity. "It is certain that God
   willeth or determineth many things which he would not, did not some act
   of man's will go before it," saith their great master, Arminius. [13]
   The like affirmeth, with a little addition (as such men do always
   "proficere in pejus"), his genuine scholar, Nic. Grevinchovius. [14] "I
   suppose," saith he, "that God willeth many things which he neither
   would nor justly could will and purpose, did not some action of the
   creature precede." And here observe, that in these places they speak
   not of God's external works, of those actions which outwardly are of
   him, -- as inflicting of punishments, bestowing of rewards, and other
   such outward acts of his providence, whose administration we confess to
   be various, and diversely applied to several occasions, -- but of the
   internal purposes of God's will, his decrees and intentions, which have
   no present influence upon, or respect unto, any action of the creature;
   yea, they deny that concerning many things God hath any determinate
   resolution at all, or any purpose farther than a natural affection
   towards them. "God doth or omitteth that towards which, in his own
   nature and his proper inclination, he is affected, as he findeth man to
   comply or not to comply with that order which he hath appointed," saith
   Corvinus. [15] Surely these men care not what indignities they cast
   upon the God of heaven, so they may maintain the pretended endowments
   of their own wills; for such an absolute power do they here ascribe
   unto them, that God himself cannot determine of a thing whereunto, as
   they strangely phrase it, he is well affected, before, by an actual
   concurrence, he is sure of their compliance. Now, this imputation, that
   they are temporary, which they cast upon the decrees of God in general,
   they press home upon that particular which lies most in their way, the
   decree of election. Concerning this they tell us roundly, that it is
   [16] false that election is confirmed from eternity: so the
   Remonstrants in their Apology, notwithstanding that St Paul tells us
   that it is the "purpose of God," Rom. ix. 11, and that we were "chosen
   before the foundation of the world," Eph. i. 4. Neither is it any thing
   material what the Arminians there grant, -- namely, that there is a
   decree preceding this, which may be said to be from everlasting: for
   seeing that St Paul teacheth us that election is nothing but God's
   purpose of saving us, to affirm that God eternally decreed that he
   would elect us is all one as to say that God purposed that in time he
   would purpose to save us. Such resolutions may be fit for their own
   wild heads, but must not be ascribed to God only wise.

   Secondly, As they affirm them to be temporary and to have had a
   beginning, so also to expire and have an ending, to be subject to
   change and variableness. "Some acts of God's will do cease at a certain
   time," saith Episcopius. [17] What? doth say thing come into his mind
   that changeth his will? "Yes," saith Arminius, [18] "He would have all
   men to be saved; but, compelled with the stubborn and incorrigible
   malice of some, he will have them to miss it." However, this is some
   recompense, -- denying God a power to do what he will, they grant him
   to be contented to do what he may, and not much repine at his hard
   condition. Certainly, if but for this favour, he is a debtor to the
   Arminians. Thieves give what they do not take. Having robbed God of his
   power, they will leave him so much goodness as that he shall not be
   troubled at it, though he be sometimes compelled to what he is very
   loath to do. How do they and their fellows, the Jesuits, [19] exclaim
   upon poor Calvin, for sometimes using the hard word of compulsion,
   describing the effectual, powerful working of the providence of God in
   the actions of men; but they can fasten the same term on the will of
   God, and no harm done! Surely he will one day plead his own cause
   against them. But yet blame them not, "si violandum est jus, regnandi
   causâ violandum est." It is to make themselves absolute that they thus
   cast off the yoke of the Almighty, and that both in things concerning
   this life and that which is to come. They are much troubled that it
   should be said that [20] every one of us bring along with us into the
   world an unchangeable pre-ordination of life and death eternal; for
   such a supposal would quite overthrow the main foundation of their
   heresy, -- namely, that men can make their election void and frustrate,
   as they jointly lay it down in their Apology. [21] Nay, it is a dream,
   saith Dr Jackson, [22] to think of God's decrees concerning things to
   come as of acts irrevocably finished; which would hinder that which
   Welsingius lays down for a truth, -- to wit, [23] "that the elect may
   become reprobates, and the reprobates elect." Now, to these particular
   sayings is their whole doctrine concerning the decrees of God, inasmuch
   as they have any reference to the actions of men, most exactly
   conformable; as, --

   First, [24] Their distinction of them into peremptory and not
   peremptory (terms rather used in the citations of litigious courts than
   as expressions of God's purpose in sacred Scripture), is not, as by
   them applied, compatible with the unchangeableness of God's eternal
   purposes. Proskairoi, say they, or temporary believers, are elected
   (though not peremptorily) with such an act of God's will as hath a
   co-existence every way commensurate, both in its original, continuance,
   and end, with their fading faith; which sometimes, like Jonah's gourd,
   is but "filia unius noctis," -- in the morning it flourisheth, in the
   evening it is cut down, dried up, and withereth. A man in Christ by
   faith, or actually believing (which to do is, as they say, in every
   one's own power), [25] is, in their opinion, the proper object of
   election; -- of election, I say, not peremptory, which is an act
   pendent, expecting the final perseverance and consummation of his
   faith; and therefore immutable, because man having fulfilled his
   course, God hath no cause to change his purpose of crowning him with
   reward. Thus also (as they teach), a man according to his infidelity,
   whether present and removable, or obdurate and final, is the only
   object of reprobation; which, in the latter case, is peremptory and
   absolute, in the former conditional and alterable. It is the qualities
   of faith and unbelief on which their election and reprobation do
   attend. [26] Now, let a faithful man, elected of God according to his
   present righteousness, apostate [apostatize] totally from grace (as to
   affirm that there is any promise of God implying his perseverance is
   with them to overthrow all religion), and let the unbelieving reprobate
   depose his incredulity and turn himself unto the Lord; answerable to
   this mutation of their conditions are the changings of the purpose of
   the Almighty concerning their everlasting state. Again; suppose these
   two, by alternate courses (as the doctrine of apostasy maintaineth they
   may), should return each to their former estate, the decrees of God
   concerning them must again be changed; for it is unjust with him either
   not to elect him that believes, though it be but for an hour, or not to
   reprobate unbelievers. Now, what unchangeableness can we fix to these
   decrees, which it lies in the power of man to make as inconstant as
   Euripus; making it, beside, to be possible that all the members of
   Christ's church, whose names are written in heaven, should within one
   hour be enrolled in the black book of damnation?

   Secondly, As these not-peremptory decrees are mutable, so they make the
   peremptory decrees of God to be temporal. "Final impenitency," say
   they, "is the only cause, and the finally unrepenting sinner is the
   only object, of reprobation, peremptory and irrevocable." As the poet
   thought none happy, [27] so they think no man to be elected, or a
   reprobate, before his death. Now, that denomination he doth receive
   from the decrees of God concerning his eternal estate, which must
   necessarily then be first enacted. The relation that is between the act
   of reprobation and the person reprobated importeth a co-existence of
   denomination. When God reprobates a man, he then becomes a reprobate;
   which if it be not before he hath actually fulfilled the measure of his
   iniquity, and sealed it up with the talent of final impenitency in his
   death, the decree of God must needs be temporal, the just Judge of all
   the world having till then suspended his determination, expecting the
   last resolution of this changeable Proteus. Nay, that God's decrees
   concerning men's eternal estates are in their judgment temporal, and
   not beginning until their death, is plain from the whole course of
   their doctrine, especially where they strive to prove that if there
   were any such determination, God could not threaten punishments or
   promise rewards. "Who," [28] say they, "can threaten punishment to him
   whom, by a peremptory decree, he will have to be free from punishment?"
   It seems he cannot have determined to save any whom he threatens to
   punish if they sin, which [it] is evident he doth all so long as they
   live in this world; which makes God not only mutable, but quite
   deprives him of his foreknowledge, and makes the form of his decree run
   thus:-- "If man will believe, I determine he shall be saved; if he will
   not, I determine he shall be damned," -- that is, "I must leave him in
   the meantime to do what he will, so I may meet with him in the end."

   Thirdly, They affirm no decree of Almighty God concerning men is so
   unalterable [29] but that all those who are now in rest or misery might
   have had contrary lots; -- that those which are damned, as Pharaoh,
   Judas, etc., might have been saved; and those which are saved, as the
   blessed Virgin, Peter, John, might have been damned: which must needs
   reflect with a strong charge of mutability on Almighty God, who knoweth
   who are his. Divers other instances in this nature I could produce,
   whereby it would be farther evident that these innovators in Christian
   religion do overthrow the eternity and unchangeableness of God's
   decrees; but these are sufficient to any discerning man. And I will
   add, in the close, an antidote against this poison, briefly showing
   what the Scripture and right reason teach us concerning these secrets
   of the Most High.

   First, "Known unto God," saith St James, "are all his works from the
   beginning," Acts xv. 18; whence it hath hitherto been concluded that
   whatever God doth in time bring to pass, that he decreed from all
   eternity so to do. All his works were from the beginning known unto
   him. Consider it particularly in the decree of election, that fountain
   of all spiritual blessings, that a saving sense and assurance thereof
   (2 Pet. i. 10) being attained, might effect a spiritual rejoicing in
   the Lord, 1 Cor. xv. 31. Such things are everywhere taught as may raise
   us to the consideration of it as of an eternal act, irrevocably and
   immutably established: "He hath chosen us before the foundation of the
   world," Eph. i. 4: his "purpose according to election," before we were
   born, must "stand," Rom. ix. 11; for to the irreversible stability of
   this act of his will he hath set to the seal of his infallible
   knowledge, 2 Tim. ii. 19. His purpose of our salvation by grace, not
   according to works, was "before the world began," 2 Tim. i. 9: an
   eternal purpose, proceeding from such a will as to which none can
   resist, joined with such a knowledge as to which all things past,
   present, and to come are open and evident, must needs also be, like the
   laws of the Medes and Persians, permanent and unalterable.

   Secondly, The [30] decrees of God, being conformable to his nature and
   essence, do require eternity and immutability as their inseparable
   properties. God, and he only, never was, nor ever can be, what now he
   is not. Passive possibility to any thing, which is the fountain of all
   change, can have no place in him who is "actus simplex," and purely
   free from all composition; whence St James affirmeth that "with him is
   no variableness, neither shadow of turning," James i. 17; with him,
   that is, in his will and purposes: and himself by his prophet, "I am
   the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed,"
   Mal. iii. 6; where he proveth the not changing of his gracious
   purposes, because he is the Lord. The eternal acts of his will not
   really differing from his unchangeable essence, must needs be
   immutable.

   Thirdly, Whatsoever God hath determined, according to the counsel of
   his wisdom and good pleasure of his will, to be accomplished, to the
   praise of his glory, standeth sure and immutable; for "the Strength of
   Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should
   repent," 1 Sam. xv. 29. "He declareth the end from the beginning, and
   from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel
   shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure," Isa. xlvi. 10; which
   certain and infallible execution of his pleasure is extended to
   particular contingent events, Isa. xlviii. 14. Yea, it is an ordinary
   thing with the Lord to confirm the certainty of those things that are
   yet for to come from his own decree; as, "The Lord of hosts hath sworn,
   saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass; and as I
   have purposed, it shall stand, that I will break the Assyrian," etc.,
   chap. xiv. 24, 25; -- "It is certain the Assyrian shall be broken,
   because the Lord hath purposed it;" which were a weak kind of
   reasoning, if his purpose might be altered. Nay "He is of one mind, and
   who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, that he doeth," Job
   xxiii. 13. "The Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
   it?" Isa. xiv. 27. So that the purpose of God and immutability of his
   counsel (Heb. vi. 17) have their certainty and firmness from eternity,
   and do not depend on the variable lubricity of mortal men; which we
   must needs grant, unless we intend to set up impotency against
   omnipotency, and arm the clay against the potter.

   Fourthly, If God's determination concerning any thing should have a
   temporal original, it must needs be either because he then perceived
   some goodness in it of which before he was ignorant, or else because
   some accident did affix a real goodness to some state of things which
   it had not from him; neither of which, without abominable blasphemy,
   can be affirmed, seeing he knoweth the end from the beginning, all
   things from everlasting, being always the same, the fountain of all
   goodness, of which other things do participate in that measure which it
   pleaseth him to communicate it unto them. Add to this the omnipotency
   of God: there is "power and might in his hand," [so] that none is able
   to withstand him, 2 Chron. xx. 6; which will not permit that any of his
   purposes be frustrate. In all our intentions, if the defect be not in
   the error of our understandings, which may be rectified by better
   information, when we cannot do that which we would, we will do that
   which we can: the alteration of our purpose is for want of power to
   fulfil it; which impotency cannot be ascribed to Almighty God, who is
   "in heaven, and hath done whatsoever he pleased," Ps. cxv. 3. So that
   the immutability of God's nature, his almighty power, the infallibility
   of his knowledge, his immunity from error in all his counsels, do show
   that he never faileth in accomplishing any thing that he proposeth for
   the manifestation of his glory.

   To close up this whole discourse, wherein I have not discovered half
   the poison contained in the Arminian doctrine concerning God's decrees,
   I will in brief present to your view the opposition that is in this
   matter betwixt the word of God and the patrons of free-will:--

                                  Chapter III.

   Of the prescience or foreknowledge of God, and how it is questioned and
   overthrown by the Arminians.

   The prescience or foreknowledge of God hath not hitherto, in express
   terms, been denied by the Arminians, but only questioned and overthrown
   by consequence, inasmuch as they deny the certainty and
   unchangeableness of his decrees, on which it is founded. It is not a
   foreknowledge of all or any thing which they oppose, but only of things
   free and contingent, and that only to comply with their
   formerly-exploded error, that the purposes of God concerning such
   things are temporal and mutable; which obstacle being once removed, the
   way is open how to ascribe the presidentship of all human actions to
   omnipotent contingency, and her sire free-will. Now, we call that
   contingent which, in regard of its next and immediate cause, before it
   come to pass, may be done or may be not done; as, that a man shall do
   such a thing tomorrow, or any time hereafter, which he may choose
   whether ever he will do or no. Such things as these are free and
   changeable, in respect of men, their immediate and second causes; but
   if we, as we ought to do, [31] look up unto Him who foreseeth and hath
   ordained the event of them or their omission, they may be said
   necessarily to come to pass or to be omitted. It could not be but as it
   was. Christians hitherto, yea, and heathens, [32] in all things of this
   nature, have usually, upon their event, reflected on God as one whose
   determination was passed on them from eternity, and who knew them long
   before; as the killing of men by the fall of a house, who might, in
   respect of the freedom of their own wills, have not been there. Or if a
   man fall into the hands of thieves, we presently conclude it was the
   will of God. It must be so; he knew it before.

   Divines, for distinction's sake, [33] ascribe unto God a twofold
   knowledge; one, intuitive or intellective, whereby he foreknoweth and
   seeth all things that are possible, -- that is, all things that can be
   done by his almighty power, -- without any respect to their future
   existence, whether they shall come to pass or no. Yea, infinite things,
   whose actual being eternity shall never behold, are thus open and naked
   unto him; for was there not strength and power in his hand to have
   created another world? was there not counsel in the storehouse of his
   wisdom to have created this otherwise, or not to have created it at
   all? Shall we say that his providence extends itself every way to the
   utmost of its activity? or can he not produce innumerable things in the
   world which now he doth not. Now, all these, and every thing else that
   is feasible to his infinite power, he foresees and knows, "scientiâ,"
   as they speak, "simplicis intelligentiæ," by his essential knowledge.

   Out [34] of this large and boundless territory of things possible, God
   by his decrees freely determineth what shall come to pass, and makes
   them future which before were but possible. After this decree, as they
   commonly speak, followeth, or together with it, as [35] others more
   exactly, taketh place, that prescience of God which they call
   "visionis," "of vision," [36] whereby he infallibly seeth all things in
   their proper causes, and how and when they shall come to pass. Now,
   these two sorts of knowledge differ, [37] inasmuch as by the one God
   knoweth what it is possible may come to pass; by the other, only what
   it is impossible should not come to pass. Things are possible in regard
   of God's power, future in regard of his decree. So that (if I may so
   say) the measure of the first kind of science is God's omnipotency,
   what he can do; of the other his purpose, what certainly he will do, or
   permit to be done. With this prescience, then, God foreseeth all, and
   nothing but what he hath decreed shall come to pass.

   For every thing to be produced next and under him, [38] God hath
   prepared divers and several kinds of causes, diversely operative in
   producing their effects, some whereof are said to work necessarily, the
   institution of their nature being to do as they do, and not otherwise;
   so the sun giveth light, and the fire heat. And yet, in some regard,
   their effects and products may be said to be contingent and free,
   inasmuch as the concurrence of God, the first cause, is required to
   their operation, who doth all things most freely, according to the
   counsel of his will. Thus the sun stood still in the time of Joshua,
   and the fire burned not the three children; but ordinarily such agents
   working "necessitate naturæ," their effects are said to be necessary.
   Secondly, To some things God hath fitted free and contingent causes,
   which either apply themselves to operation in particular, according to
   election, choosing to do this thing rather than that; as angels and
   men, in their free and deliberate actions, which they so perform as
   that they could have not done them; -- or else they produce effects
   kata to sumbebekos, merely by accident, and the operation of such
   things we say to be casual; as if a hatchet, falling out of the hand of
   a man cutting down a tree, should kill another whom he never saw. Now,
   nothing in either of these ways comes to pass but God hath determined
   it, both for the matter and manner, [39] even so as is agreeable to
   their causes, -- some necessarily, some freely, some casually or
   contingently, yet also, as having a certain futurition from his decree,
   he infallibly foreseeth that they shall so come to pass. But yet that
   he doth so in respect of things free and contingent is much questioned
   by the Arminians in express terms, and denied by consequence,
   notwithstanding St Jerome affirmeth [40] that so to do is destructive
   to the very essence of the Deity.

   First, Their doctrine of the mutability of God's decrees, on whose
   firmness is founded the infallibility of this prescience, doth quite
   overthrow it. God thus foreknowing only what he hath so decreed shall
   come to pass, if that be no firmer settled but that it may [be] and is
   often altered, according to the divers inclinations of men's wills,
   which I showed before they affirm, he can have at best but a
   conjectural foreknowledge of what is yet for to come, not founded on
   his own unchangeable purpose, but upon a guess at the free inclination
   of men's wills. For instance, [41] God willeth that all men should be
   saved. This act of his will, according to the Arminian doctrine, is his
   conditionate decree to save all men if they will believe. Well, among
   these is Judas, as [42] equal a sharer in the benefit of this decree as
   Peter. God, then, will have him to be saved, and to this end allows him
   all those means which are necessary to beget faith in him, and are
   every way sufficient to that purpose, and do produce that effect in
   others; what can God foresee, then, but that Judas as well as Peter
   will believe? He intendeth he should, he hath determined nothing to the
   contrary. Let him come, then, and act his own part. Why, he proves so
   obstinately malicious, [43] that God, with all his omnipotency, as they
   speak, by any way that becomes him, which must not be by any
   irresistible efficacy, cannot change his obdurate heart. Well, then, he
   determineth, according to the exigence of his justice, that he shall be
   damned for his impenitency, and foreseeth that accordingly. But now,
   suppose this wretch, even at his last moment, should bethink himself
   and return to the Lord, which in their conceit he may, notwithstanding
   his former reprobation (which, [44] as they state it, seems a great act
   of mercy), [45] God must keep to the rules of his justice, and elect or
   determine to save him; by which the varlet hath twice or thrice
   deceived his expectation.

   Secondly, [46] They affirm that God is said properly to expect and
   desire divers things which yet never come to pass. "We grant," saith
   Corvinus, "that there are desires in God that never are fulfilled."
   Now, surely, to desire what one is sure will never come to pass is not
   an act regulated by wisdom or counsel; and, therefore, they must grant
   that before he did not know but perhaps so it might be. "God wisheth
   and desireth some good things, which yet come not to pass," [47] say
   they, in their Confession; whence one of these two things must needs
   follow, -- either, first, that there is a great deal of imperfection in
   his nature, to desire and expect what he knows shall never come to
   pass; or else he did not know but it might, which overthrows his
   prescience. Yea, and say they expressly, [48] "That the hope and
   expectation of God is deceived by man;" and confess, "that the strength
   of their strongest argument lies in this, that God hoped and expected
   obedience from Israel." Secondly, That he complaineth that his hope is
   deluded, which, being taken properly, and as they urge it, cannot
   consist with his eternal prescience; for they disesteem the usual
   answer of divines, that hope, expectation, and such like passions,
   which include in them any imperfection, are ascribed unto God per
   anthropopatheian, -- in regard of that analogy his actions hold with
   such of ours as we perform having those passions.

   Thirdly, [49] They teach that God hath determined nothing concerning
   such things as these in question. "That God hath determined future
   contingent things unto either part (I mean such as issue from the
   free-will of the creature), I abominate, hate, and curse, as false,
   absurd, and leading us on unto blasphemy," saith Arminius. To determine
   of them to either part is to determine and ordain whether they shall
   be, or whether they shall not be; as, that David shall or shall not go
   up tomorrow against the Philistines, and prevail. Now, the
   infallibility of God's foreknowing of such things depending on the
   certainty of his decree and determination, if there be no such thing as
   this, that also must needs fall to the ground.

   Fourthly, [50] See what positively they write concerning this
   everlasting foreknowledge of God:-- First, They call it a troublesome
   question; secondly, They make it a thing disputable whether there be
   any such thing or no; and though haply it may be ascribed unto God,
   yet, thirdly, They think it no motive to the worship of him; fourthly,
   They say, better it were quite exploded, because the difficulties that
   attend it can scarcely be reconciled with man's liberty, God's
   threatenings and promises; yea, fifthly, It seems rather to be invented
   to crucify poor mortals than to be of any moment in religion. So
   Episcopius. It may be excepted that this is but one doctor's opinion.
   It is true, they are one man's words; but the thing itself is
   countenanced by the whole sect. As, first, in the large prolix
   declaration of their opinions, they speak not one word of it; and being
   taxed for this omission by the professors of Leyden, they vindicate
   themselves so coldly in their Apology, that some learned men do from
   hence conclude, [51] that certainly, in their most secret judgments,
   all the Arminians do consent with Socinus in ascribing unto God only a
   conjectural foreknowledge. And one great prophet of their own affirms
   roundly, [52] "That God, after his manner, oftentimes feareth, that is,
   suspecteth, and that not without cause, and prudently conjectureth,
   that this or that evil may arise," Vorstius. And their chiefest
   patriarchs, [53] "That God doth often intend what he doth not foresee
   will come to pass," Armin., Corv. Now, whether this kind of atheism be
   tolerable among Christians or no, let all men judge who have their
   senses exercised in the word of God; which, I am sure, teaches us
   another lesson. For, --

   First, It is laid down as a firm foundation, that "known unto God are
   all his works from the beginning of the world," Acts xv. 18. Every
   thing, then, that in any respect may be called his work, is known unto
   him from all eternity. Now, what in the world, if we may speak as he
   hath taught us, can be exempted from this denomination? Even actions in
   themselves sinful are not; though not as sinful, yet in some other
   regard, as punishments of others. "Behold," saith Nathan to David, in
   the name of God, "I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
   them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight
   of this sun; for thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing
   before all Israel," 2 Sam. xii. 11, 12. So, also, when wicked robbers
   had nefariously spoiled Job of all his substance, the holy man
   concludeth, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away," chap. i. 21.
   Now, if the working of God's providence be so mighty and effectual,
   even in and over those actions wherein the devil and men do most
   maliciously offend, as did Absalom and the Sabean with the Chaldean
   thieves, that it may be said to be his work, and he may be said to "do
   it" (I crave liberty to use the Scripture phrase), then certainly
   nothing in the world, in some respect or other, is independent of his
   all-disposing hand; yea, Judas himself betraying our Saviour did
   nothing but "what his hand and counsel determined before should be
   done," [54] Acts iv. 28, in respect of the event of the thing itself.
   And if these actions, notwithstanding these two hindrances, -- first,
   that they were contingent, wrought by free agents, working according to
   election and choice; secondly, that they were sinful and wicked in the
   agents, -- had yet their dependence on his purpose and determinate
   counsel, surely he hath an interest of operation in the acts of every
   creature. But his works, as it appears before, are all known unto him
   from the beginning, for he worketh nothing by chance or accidentally,
   but all things determinately, according to his own decree, or "the
   counsel of his own will," Eph. i. 11.

   Secondly, The manner of God's knowing of things doth evidently show
   that nothing that is, or may be, can be hid from him; [55] which is not
   by discourse and collection of one thing out of another, conclusions
   out of principles, but altogether and at once, evidently, clearly, and
   distinctly, both in respect tou hoti, and tou dioti. By one most pure
   act of his own essence he discerneth all things: for there is "no
   creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all are naked and
   opened unto his eyes," Heb. iv. 13. So that those things concerning
   which we treat [56] he knoweth three ways:-- First, In himself and his
   own decree, as the first cause; in which respect they may be said to be
   necessary, in respect of the certainty of their event. Secondly, In
   their immediate causes, wherein their contingency doth properly
   consist. Thirdly, In their own nature as future, but to his infinite
   knowledge ever present.

   Thirdly, The Scripture [57] is full of expressions to this purpose, --
   to wit, "That God knoweth all secrets, and revealeth hidden things: he
   searcheth the reins and the heart: he knoweth the number of the stars,
   and the birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the falling of
   sparrows, the number of the hairs of our heads." Some places are most
   remarkable, as that of the Psalmist, "He knoweth my thoughts long
   before;" even before ever they come into our minds, before their first
   rising. And yet many actions that are most contingent depend upon those
   thoughts known unto God from eternity; nay, -- which breaketh the very
   neck of the goddess contingency, -- those things wherein her greatest
   power is imagined to consist are directly ascribed unto God, as our
   words, "the answer of the tongue," Prov. xvi. 1; and the directing of
   an arrow, shot by chance, to a mark not aimed at, 1 Kings xxii. 34.
   Surely God must needs foreknow the event of that contingent action; he
   must needs know the man would so shoot who had determined his arrow
   should be the death of a king. He maketh men poor and rich, Prov. xxii.
   2; He lifteth up one, and pulleth down another, Ps. lxxv. 7. How many
   contingencies did gorgon omma tou despotou, his piercing eye run
   through to foresee the crowning of Esther for the deliverance of his
   people! In a word, "Known unto God are all his works." Now, what can
   possibly be imagined to be more contingent than the killing of a man by
   the fall of an axe from out of his hand who intended no such thing? Yet
   this God assumeth as his own work, Deut. xix. 5, Exod. xxi. 13; and so
   surely was by him foreknown.

   Fourthly, Do but consider the prophecies in Scripture, especially those
   concerning our Saviour, how many free and contingent actions did concur
   for the fulfilling of them; as Isa. vii. 14, ix. 6, liii.; Gen. iii.
   15, etc. The like may be said of other predictions; as of the wasting
   of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, which though, in regard of God's
   prescience, it was certainly to come to pass, yet they did it most
   freely, not only following the counsel of their own wills, but also
   using divination, or chanceable lots, for their direction, Ezek. xxi.
   21. Yet he who made the eye seeth all these things, Ps. xciv. 9.

   Divers other reasons and testimonies might be produced to confirm our
   doctrine of God's everlasting prescience; which, notwithstanding
   Episcopius' blasphemy, that it serves for nought but to cruciate poor
   mortals, we believe to be a good part of the foundation of all that
   consolation which God is pleased to afford us in this vale of tears.
   Amidst all our afflictions and temptations, under whose pressure we
   should else faint and despair, it is no small comfort to be assured
   that we do nor can suffer nothing but what his hand and counsel guides
   unto us, what is open and naked before his eyes, and whose end and
   issue he knoweth long before; which is a strong motive to patience, a
   sure anchor of hope, a firm ground of consolation. Now, to present in
   one view how opposite the opinions of the worshippers of the great
   goddess contingency are to this sacred truth, take this short
   antithesis:--

   S. S.

   Lib. Arbit.

   "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world,"
   Acts xv. 18.

   "God sometimes feareth, and prudently conjectureth, that this or that

   "Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but
   all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have

   "God doth not always foresee the event of what he intendeth," Corvin.

   "He that formed the eye, shall he not see?" Ps. xciv. 9. "When a man

   Deut. xix. 5. "God delivers him into his hand," Exod. xxi. 13.

   "Future contingencies are not determined unto either part," Armin. That
   is, God hath not determined, and so, consequently, doth not foreknow,
   whether they shall come to pass or no.

   or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? for your heavenly Father knoweth

                                  Chapter IV.

   Of the providence of God in governing the world diversely, thrust from
   this pre-eminence by the Arminian idol of free-will.

   I come now to treat of that betwixt which and the Pelagian idol there
   is bellum aspondon, implacable war and immortal hatred, absolutely
   destructive to the one side, -- to wit, the providence of God. For
   this, in that notion Christianity hath hitherto embraced it, and that,
   in such a sense as the Arminians maintain it, can no more consist
   together than fire and water, light and darkness, Christ and Belial,
   and he that shall go to conjoin them ploughs with an ox and an ass;
   they must be tied together with the same ligament "quo ille mortua
   jungebat corpora vivis," -- wherewith the tyrant tied dead bodies to
   living men. This strange advancement of the clay against the potter,
   not by the way of repining, and to say, "Why hast thou made me thus?"
   but by the way of emulation, "I will not be so, I will advance myself
   to the sky, to the sides of thy throne," was heretofore unknown to the
   more refined Paganism. [58] As these of contingency, so they, with a
   better error, made a goddess of providence, because, as they feigned,
   she helped Latona to bring forth in the isle of Delos; intimating that
   Latona, or nature, though big and great with sundry sorts of effects,
   could yet produce nothing without the interceding help of divine
   providence: which mythology of theirs seems to contain a sweeter gust
   of divine truth than any we can expect from their towering fancies [59]
   who are inclinable to believe that God for no other reason is said to
   sustain all things, but because he doth not destroy them. Now, that
   their proud, God-opposing errors may the better appear, according to my
   former method, I will plainly show what the Scripture teacheth us
   concerning this providence, with what is agreeable to right and
   Christian reason, not what is dictated by tumultuating affections.

   Providence is a word which, in its proper signification, may seem to
   comprehend all the actions of God that outwardly are of him, that have
   any respect unto his creatures, all his works that are not ad intra,
   essentially belonging unto the Deity. Now, because God "worketh all
   things according to his decree, or the counsel of his will," Eph. i.
   11, for whatsoever he doth now it pleased him from the beginning, Ps.
   cxv. 3; seeing, also, that known unto God are all his works from
   eternity; therefore, three things concerning his providence are
   considerable:-- 1. His decree or purpose, [60] whereby he hath disposed
   of all things in order, and appointed them for certain ends, which he
   hath fore-ordained. 2. His prescience, whereby he certainly
   fore-knoweth all things that shall come to pass. 3. His temporal
   operation, or working in time, -- "My Father worketh hitherto," John v.
   17, -- whereby he actually executeth all his good pleasure. The first
   and second of these have been the subject of the former chapters; the
   latter only now requireth our consideration.

   This, then, we may conceive as an ineffable act or work of Almighty
   God, whereby he cherisheth, sustaineth, and governeth the world, or all
   things by him created, moving them, agreeably to those natures which he
   endowed them withal in the beginning, unto those ends which he hath
   proposed. To confirm this, I will first prove this position, That the
   whole world is cared for by God, and by him governed, and therein all
   men, good or bad, all things in particular, be they never so small and
   in our eyes inconsiderable. Secondly, show the manner how God worketh
   all, in all things, and according to the diversity of secondary causes
   which he hath created; whereof some are necessary, some free, others
   contingent, which produce their effects nec pantos, nec epi to polu,
   sed kata sumbebekos, merely by accident.

   The providence of God in governing the world is plentifully made known
   unto us, both by his works and by his word. I will give a few instances
   of either sort:-- 1. In general, that the almighty Demiourgos, and
   Framer of this whole universe, should propose unto himself no end in
   the creation of all things, -- that he should want either power,
   goodness, will, or wisdom, to order and dispose the works of his own
   hands, -- is altogether impossible. 2. Take a particular instance in
   one concerning accident, the knowledge whereof by some means or other,
   in some degree or other, hath spread itself throughout the world, --
   and that is that almost universal destruction of all by the flood,
   whereby the whole world was well-nigh reduced to its primitive
   confusion. Is there nothing but chance to be seen in this? was there
   any circumstance about it that did not show a God and his providence?
   Not to speak of those revelations whereby God foretold that he would
   bring such a deluge, what chance, what fortune, could collect such a
   small number of individuals of all sorts, wherein the whole kind might
   be preserved? What hand guided that poor vessel from the rocks and gave
   it a resting-place on the mountains? Certainly, the very reading of
   that story, Gen. vii., viii., having for confirmation the catholic
   tradition of all mankind, were enough to startle the stubborn heart of
   an atheist.

   The word of God doth not less fully relate it than his works do declare
   it, Ps. xix., "My Father worketh hitherto," saith our Saviour, John v.
   17. But did not God end his work on the seventh day, and did he not
   then "rest from all his work?" Gen. ii. 2. True, from his work of
   creation by his omnipotence; but his work of gubernation by his
   providence as yet knows no end. Yea, and divers particular things he
   doth besides the ordinary course, only to make known "that he thus
   worketh," John ix. 3. As he hath framed all things by his wisdom, so he
   continueth them by his providence in excellent order, as is at large
   declared in that golden Psalm civ.: and this is not bounded to any
   particular places or things, but "his eyes are in every place,
   beholding the evil and the good," Prov. xv. 3; so that "none can hide
   himself in secret places that he shall not see him," Jer. xxiii. 24;
   Acts xvii. 24; Job v. 10, 11; Exod. iv. 11. And all this he saith that
   men "may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there
   is none beside him. He is the Lord, and there is none else. He formeth
   the light, and createth darkness: he maketh peace, and createth evil:
   he doeth all these things," Isa. xlv. 6, 7. In these and innumerable
   like places doth the Lord declare that there is nothing which he hath
   made, that with the good hand of his providence he doth not govern and
   sustain.

   Now, this general extent of his common providence to all doth no way
   hinder but that he may exercise certain special acts thereof towards
   some in particular, even by how much nearer than other things they
   approach unto him and are more assimilated unto his goodness. I mean
   his church here on earth, and those whereof it doth consist; "for what
   nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them?" Deut. iv. 7.
   In the government hereof he most eminently showeth his glory, and
   exerciseth his power. Join here his works with his word, what he hath
   done with what he hath promised to do for the conservation of his
   church and people, and you will find admirable issues of a more special
   providence. Against this he promiseth "the gates of hell shall not
   prevail," Matt. xvi. 18; -- amidst of these he hath promised to remain,
   chap. xxviii. 20; supplying them with an addition of all things
   necessary, Matt. vi. 33; desiring that "all their care might be cast
   upon him, who careth for them," 1 Pet. v. 7; forbidding any to "touch
   his anointed ones," Ps. cv. 15, and that because they are unto him as
   "the apple of his eye," Zech. ii. 8. Now, this special providence hath
   respect unto a supernatural end, to which that, and that alone, is to
   be conveyed.

   For wicked men, as they are excepted from this special care and
   government, so they are not exempted from the dominion of his almighty
   hand. He who hath created them "for the day of evil," Prov. xvi. 4, and
   provided a "place of their own" for them to go unto, Acts i. 25, doth
   not in this world suffer them to live without the verge of his
   all-ruling providence; but by suffering and enduring their iniquities
   with great patience and "long-suffering," Rom. ix. 22, defending them
   oftentimes from the injuries of one another, Gen. iv. 15, by granting
   unto them many temporal blessings, Matt. v. 45, disposing of all their
   works to the glory of his great name, Prov. xxi. 1, 2, he declareth
   that they also live, and move, and have their being in him, and are
   under the government of his providence. Nay, there is not the least
   thing in this world to which his care and knowledge doth not descend.
   Ill would it become his wisdom not to sustain, order, and dispose of
   all things by him created, but leave them to the ruin of uncertain
   chance. Jerome [61] then was injurious to his providence, and cast a
   blemish on his absolute perfection, whilst he thought to have cleared
   his majesty from being defiled with the knowledge and care of the
   smallest reptiles and vermin every moment; and St Austin is express to
   the contrary: [62] "Who," saith he, "hath disposed the several members
   of the flea and gnat, that hath given unto them order, life, and
   motion?" etc., -- even most agreeable to holy Scriptures: so Ps. civ.
   20, 21, cxlv. 15; Matt. vi. 26, 30, "He feedeth the fowls, and clotheth
   the grass of the field;" Job xxxix. 1, 2; Jonah iv. 6, 7. Sure it is
   not troublesome to God to take notice of all that he hath created. Did
   he use that great power in the production of the least of his
   creatures, so far beyond the united activity of men and angels, for no
   end at all? Doubtless, even they also must have a well-disposed order,
   for the manifestation of his glory. "Not a sparrow falleth on the
   ground without our Father;" even "the hairs of our head are all
   numbered," Matt. x. 29, 30. "He clotheth the lilies and grass of the
   field, which is to be cast into the oven," Luke xii. 27, 28. Behold his
   knowledge and care of them! Again, he used frogs and lice for the
   punishment of the Egyptians, Exod. viii.; with a gourd and a worm he
   exercised his servant Jonah, chap. iv.; yea, he calls the locusts his
   "terrible army;" -- and shall not God know and take care of the number
   of his soldiers, the ordering of his dreadful host?

   That God by his providence governeth and disposeth of all things by him
   created is sufficiently proved; the manner how he worketh all in all,
   how he ordereth the works of his own hands, in what this governing and
   disposing of his creatures doth chiefly consist, comes now to be
   considered. And here four things are principally to be observed:--
   First, The sustaining, preserving, and upholding of all things by his
   power; for "he upholdeth all things by the word of his power," Heb. i.
   3. Secondly, His working together with all things, by an influence of
   causality into the agents themselves; "for he also hath wrought all our
   works in us," Isa. xxvi. 12. Thirdly, His powerful overruling of all
   events, both necessary, free, and contingent, and disposing of them to
   certain ends for the manifestation of his glory. So Joseph tells his
   brethren, "As for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
   unto good, to bring to pass, as it is at this day, to save much people
   alive," Gen. l. 20. Fourthly, His determining and restraining second
   causes to such and such effects: "The king's heart is in the hand of
   the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will,"
   Prov. xxi. 1.

   First, His sustentation or upholding of all things is his powerful
   continuing of their being, natural strength, and faculties, bestowed on
   them at their creation: "In him we live, and move, and have our being,"
   Acts xvii. So that he doth neither work all himself in them, without
   any co-operation of theirs, which would not only turn all things into
   stocks, yea, and take from stocks their own proper nature, but also is
   contrary to that general blessing he spread over the face of the whole
   world in the beginning, "Be fruitful, and multiply," Gen. i. 22; -- nor
   yet leave them to a self-subsistence, he in the meantime only not
   destroying them; [63] which would make him an idle spectator of most
   things in the world, not to "work hitherto," as our Saviour speaks, and
   grant to divers things here below an absolute being, not derivative
   from him: the first whereof is blasphemous, the latter impossible.

   Secondly, For God's working in and together with all second causes for
   producing of their effects, what part or portion in the work punctually
   to assign unto him, what to the power of the inferior causes, seems
   beyond the reach of mortals; neither is an exact comprehension thereof
   any way necessary, so that we make every thing beholding to his power
   for its being, and to his assistance for its operation.

   Thirdly, His supreme dominion exerciseth itself in disposing of all
   things to certain and determinate ends for his own glory, and is
   chiefly discerned advancing itself over those things which are most
   contingent, and making them in some sort necessary, inasmuch as they
   are certainly disposed of to some proposed ends. Between the birth and
   death of a man, how many things merely contingent do occur! how many
   chances! how many diseases! in their own nature all evitable, and, in
   regard of the event, not one of them but to some proves mortal; yet,
   certain it is that a man's "days are determined, the number of his
   months are with the Lord, he hath appointed his bounds that he cannot
   pass," Job xiv. 5. And oftentimes by things purely contingent and
   accidental he executeth his purposes, -- bestoweth rewards, inflicteth
   punishments, and accomplisheth his judgments; as when he delivereth a
   man to be slain by the head of an axe, flying from the helve in the
   hand of a man cutting a tree by the way. But in nothing is this more
   evident than in the ancient casting of lots, a thing as casual and
   accidental as can be imagined, huddled in the cap at a venture. Yet God
   overruleth them to the declaring of his purpose, freeing truth from
   doubts, and manifestation of his power: Prov. xvi. 33, "The lot is cast
   into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord;" -- as
   you may see in the examples of Achan, Josh. vii. 16-18; Saul, 1 Sam. x.
   20, 21; Jonathan, chap. xiv. 41, 42; Jonah, chap. i. 7; Matthias, Acts
   i. 26. And yet this overruling act of God's providence (as no other
   decree or act of his) doth not rob things contingent of their proper
   nature; for cannot he who effectually causeth that they shall come to
   pass, cause also that they shall come to pass contingently?

   Fourthly, God's predetermination of second causes (which I name not
   last as though it were the last act of God's providence about his
   creatures, for indeed it is the first that concerneth their operation)
   is that effectual working of his, according to his eternal purpose,
   whereby, though some agents, as the wills of men, are causes most free
   and indefinite, or unlimited lords of their own actions, in respect of
   their internal principle of operation (that is, their own nature),
   [they] are yet all, in respect of his decree, and by his powerful
   working, determined to this or that effect in particular; not that they
   are compelled to do this, or hindered from doing that, but are inclined
   and disposed to do this or that, according to their proper manner of
   working, that is, most freely: for truly such testimonies are
   everywhere obvious in Scripture, of the stirring up of men's wills and
   minds, of bending and inclining them to divers things, of the governing
   of the secret thoughts and motions of the heart, as cannot by any means
   be referred to a naked permission, with a government of external
   actions, or to a general influence, whereby they should have power to
   do this or that, or any thing else; wherein, as some suppose, his whole
   providence consisteth.

   Let us now jointly apply these several acts to free agents, working
   according to choice, or relation, such as are the wills of men, and
   that will open the way to take a view of Arminian heterodoxies,
   concerning this article of Christian belief. And here two things must
   be premised:-- First, That they be not deprived of their own radical or
   original internal liberty; secondly, That they be not exempt from the
   moving influence and gubernation of God's providence; -- the first
   whereof would leave no just room for rewards and punishments; the
   other, as I said before, is injurious to the majesty and power of God.
   St Augustine [64] judged Cicero worthy of special blame, even among the
   heathens, for so attempting to make men free that he made them
   sacrilegious, by denying them to be subject to an overruling
   providence: which gross error was directly maintained by Damascen, [65]
   a learned Christian, teaching, "Things whereof we have any power, not
   to depend on providence, but on our own free will;" an opinion fitter
   for a hog of the Epicurus herd than for a scholar in the school of
   Christ. And yet this proud, prodigious error is now, though in other
   terms, stiffly maintained: for what do they else who ascribe such an
   absolute independent liberty to the will of man, that it should have in
   its own power every circumstance, every condition whatsoever, that
   belongs to operation, so that all things required on the part of God,
   or otherwise, to the performance of an action being accomplished, it
   remaineth solely in the power of a man's own will whether he will do it
   or no? which supreme and plainly divine liberty, joined with such an
   absolute uncontrollable power and dominion over all his actions, would
   exempt and free the will of man, not only from all fore-determining to
   the production of such and such effects, but also from any effectual
   working or influence of the providence of God into the will itself,
   that should sustain, help, or cooperate with it in doing or willing any
   thing; and, therefore, the authors of this imaginary liberty have
   wisely framed an imaginary concurrence of God's providence, answerable
   unto it, -- namely, a general and indifferent influence, always waiting
   and expecting the will of man to determine itself to this or that
   effect, good or bad; God being, as it were, always ready at hand to do
   that small part which he hath in our actions, whensoever we please to
   use him, or, if we please to let him alone, he no way moveth us to the
   performance of any thing. Now, God forbid that we should give our
   consent to the choice of such a captain, under whose conduct we might
   go down again unto Paganism, -- to the erecting of such an idol into
   the throne of the Almighty. No, doubtless, let us be most indulgent to
   our wills, and assign them all the liberty that is competent unto a
   created nature, to do all things freely according to election and
   foregoing counsel, being free from all natural necessity and outward
   compulsion; but for all this, let us not presume to deny God's
   effectual assistance, his particular powerful influence into the wills
   and actions of his creatures, directing of them to a voluntary
   performance of what he hath determined: which the Arminians opposing in
   the behalf of their darling free-will, do work in the hearts of men an
   overweening of their own power, and an absolute independence of the
   providence of God; for, --

   First, they deny that God (in whom we live, and move, and have our
   being) doth any thing by his providence, [66] "whereby the creature
   should be stirred up, or helped in any of his actions." That is, God
   wholly leaves a man in the hand of his own counsel, to the disposal of
   his own absolute independent power, without any respect to his
   providence at all; whence, as they do, they may well conclude, [67]
   "that those things which God would have to be done of us freely" (such
   as are all human actions), "he cannot himself will or work more
   powerfully and effectually than by the way of wishing or desiring," as
   Vorstius speaks; which is no more than one man can do concerning
   another, perhaps far less than an angel. I can wish or desire that
   another man would do what I have a mind he should; but, truly, to
   describe the providence of God by such expressions seems to me
   intolerable blasphemy. But thus it must be; without such helps as
   these, Dagon cannot keep on his head, nor the idol of uncontrollable
   freewill enjoy his dominion.

   Hence Corvinus will grant [68] that the killing of a man by the
   slipping of an axe's head from the helve, although contingent, may be
   said to happen according to God's counsel and determinate will; but on
   no terms will he yield that this may be applied to actions wherein the
   counsel and freedom of man's will do take place, as though that they
   also should have dependence on any such overruling power; -- whereby he
   absolutely excludeth the providence of God from having any sovereignty
   within the territory of human actions, which is plainly to shake off
   the yoke of his dominion, and to make men lords paramount within
   themselves: so that they may well ascribe unto God (as they do [69] )
   only a deceivable expectation of those contingent things that are yet
   for to come, there being no act of his own in the producing of such
   effects on which he can ground any certainty; only, he may take a
   conjecture, according to his guess at men's inclinations. And, indeed,
   this is the Helen for whose enjoyment, these thrice ten years, they
   have maintained warfare with the hosts of the living God; their whole
   endeavour being to prove, that, notwithstanding the performance of all
   things, on the part of God, required for the production of any action,
   [70] yet the will of man remains absolutely free, yea, in respect of
   the event, as well as its manner of operation, to do it or not to do
   it. That is, notwithstanding God's decree that such an action shall be
   performed, and his foreknowledge that it will so come to pass;
   notwithstanding his cooperating with the will of man (as far as they
   will allow him) for the doing of it, and though he hath determined by
   that act of man to execute some of his own judgments; [71] yet there is
   no kind of necessity but that he may as well omit as do it: which is
   all one as if they should say, "Our tongues are our own; we ought to
   speak: who is lord over us? We will vindicate ourselves into a liberty
   of doing what and how we will, though for it we cast God out of his
   throne." And, indeed, if we mark it, we shall find them undermining and
   pulling down the actual providence of God, at the root and several
   branches thereof; for, --

   First, For his conservation or sustaining of all things, they affirm
   [72] it to be very likely that this is nothing but a negative act of
   his will, whereby he willeth or determineth not to destroy the things
   by him created; and when we produce places of Scripture which affirm
   that it is an act of his power, they say they are foolishly cited. So
   that, truly, let the Scripture say what it will, (in their conceit,)
   God doth no more sustain and uphold all his creatures than I do a house
   when I do not set it on fire, or a worm when I do not tread upon it.

   Secondly, For God's concurring with inferior causes in all their acts
   and working, they affirm it to be only [73] a general influence, alike
   upon all and every one, which they may use or not use at their
   pleasure, and in the use determine it to this or that effect, be it
   good or bad (so Corvinus), as it seems best unto them. In a word, to
   the will of man [74] it is nothing but what suffers it to play its own
   part freely, according to its inclination; as they jointly speak in
   their Confession. Observe, also, that they account this influence of
   his providence not to be into the agent, the will of man, whereby that
   should be helped or enabled to do any thing (no, that would seem to
   grant a self-sufficiency), [75] but only into the act itself for its
   production: as if I should help a man to lift a log, it becomes perhaps
   unto him so much the lighter, but he is not made one jot the stronger;
   which takes off the proper work of providence, consisting in an
   internal assistance.

   Thirdly, For God's determining or circumscribing the will of man to do
   this or that in particular, they absolutely explode it, as a thing
   destructive to their adored liberty. [76] "It is no way consistent with
   it," say they, in their Apology. So also Arminius: [77] "The providence
   of God doth not determine the will of man to one part of the
   contradiction." That is, "God hath not determined that you shall, nor
   doth by any means overrule your wills, to do this thing rather than
   that, to do this or to omit that." So that the sum of their endeavour
   is, to prove that the will of man is so absolutely free, independent,
   and uncontrollable, that God doth not, nay, with all his power cannot,
   determine it certainly and infallibly to the performance of this or
   that particular action, thereby to accomplish his own purposes, to
   attain his own ends. Truly, it seems to me the most unfortunate attempt
   that ever Christians lighted on; which, if it should get success
   answerable to the greatness of the undertaking, the providence of God,
   in men's esteem, would be almost thrust quite out of the world. "Tantæ
   molis erat." The new goddess contingency could not be erected until the
   God of heaven was utterly despoiled of his dominion over the sons of
   men, and in the room thereof a home-bred idol of self-sufficiency set
   up, and the world persuaded to worship it. But that the building climb
   no higher, let all men observe how the word of God overthrows this
   Babylonian tower.

   First, then, In innumerable places it is punctual that his providence
   doth not only bear rule in the counsels of men and their most secret
   resolutions, (whence the prophet declareth that he knoweth that "the
   way of man is not in himself," -- that "it is not in man that walketh
   to direct his steps," Jer. x. 23; and Solomon, that "a man's heart,
   deviseth his way, but the Lord directeth his steps," Prov. xvi. 9;
   David, also, having laid this ground, that "the Lord bringeth the
   counsel of the heathen to naught," and "maketh the devices of the
   people of none effect," but "his own counsel standeth for ever, the
   thoughts of his heart to all generations," Ps. xxxiii. 10, 11,
   proceedeth accordingly, in his own distress, to pray that the Lord
   would infatuate and make [78] "foolish the counsel of Ahithophel," 2
   Sam. xv. 31, -- which also the Lord did, by working in the heart of
   Absalom to hearken to the cross counsel of Hushai); but also, secondly,
   That the working of his providence is effectual even in the hearts and
   wills of men to turn them which way he will, and to determine them to
   this or that in particular, according as he pleaseth: "The preparations
   of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord,"
   saith Solomon, Prov. xvi. 1; -- which Jacob trusted and relied on when
   he prayed that the Lord would grant his sons to find favour and mercy
   before that man whom then he supposed to be some atheistical Egyptian,
   Gen. xliii. 14; whence we must grant, either that the good old man
   believed that it was in the hand of God to incline and unalterably turn
   and settle the heart of Joseph to favour his brethren, or else his
   prayer must have had such a senseless sense as this: "Grant, O Lord,
   such a general influence of thy providence, that the heart of that man
   may be turned to good towards my sons, or else that it may not, being
   left to its own freedom." A strange request! yet how it may be bettered
   by one believing the Arminian doctrine I cannot conceive. Thus Solomon
   affirmeth that "the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, like the
   rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will," Prov. xxi. 1. If
   the heart of a king, who hath an inward natural liberty equal with
   others, and an outward liberty belonging to his state and condition
   above them, be yet so in the hand of the Lord as that he always turneth
   it to what he pleaseth in particular, then certainly other men are not
   excepted from the rule of the same providence; which is the plain sense
   of these words, and the direct thesis which we maintain in opposition
   to the Arminian idol of absolute independent free-will. So Daniel,
   also, reproving the Babylonian tyrant, affirmeth that he "glorified not
   the God in whose hand was his breath, and whose were all his ways,"
   chap. v. 23. Not only his breath and life, but also all his ways, his
   actions, thoughts, and words, were in the hand of God.

   Yea, thirdly, sometimes the saints of God, as I touched before, do pray
   that God would be pleased thus to determine their hearts, and bend
   their wills, and wholly incline them to some one certain thing, and
   that without any prejudice to their true and proper liberty: so David,
   Ps. cxix. 36, "Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
   covetousness." This prayer being his may also be ours, and we may ask
   it in faith, relying on the power and promise of God in Christ that he
   will perform our petitions, John xiv. 14. Now, I desire any Christian
   to resolve, whether, by these and the like requests, he intendeth to
   desire at the hand of God nothing but such an indifferent motion to any
   good as may leave him to his own choice whether he will do it or no,
   which is all the Arminians will grant him; or rather, that he would
   powerfully bend his heart and soul unto his testimonies, and work in
   him an actual embracing of all the ways of God, not desiring more
   liberty, but only enough to do it willingly. Nay, surely the prayers of
   God's servants, requesting, with Solomon, that the Lord would be with
   them, and "incline their heart unto him, to keep his statutes and walk
   in his commandments," 1 Kings viii. 57, 58; and with David, to "create
   in them a clean heart, and renew a right spirit within them," Ps. li.
   10; when, according to God's promises, they entreat him "to put his
   fear into their hearts," Jer. xxxii. 40, "to unite their hearts to fear
   his name," Ps. lxxxvi. 11, to work in them both the will and the deed,
   an actual obedience unto his law; -- cannot possibly aim at nothing but
   a general influence, enabling them alike either to do or not to do what
   they so earnestly long after.

   Fourthly, The certainty of divers promises and threatenings of Almighty
   God dependeth upon his powerful determining and turning the wills and
   hearts of men which way he pleaseth; thus, to them that fear him he
   promiseth that they shall find favour in the sight of men, Prov. iii.
   4. Now, if, notwithstanding all God's powerful operation in their
   hearts, it remaineth absolutely in the hands of men whether they will
   favour them that fear him or no, it is wholly in their power whether
   God shall be true in his promises or no. Surely when Jacob wrestled
   with God on the strength of such promise, Gen. xxxii. 12, he little
   thought of any question whether it were in the power of God to perform
   it. Yea, and the event showed that there ought to be no such question,
   chap. xxxiii.; for the Lord turned the heart of his brother Esau, as he
   doth of others when he makes them pity his servants when at any time
   they have carried them away captives, Ps. cvi. 46. See, also, the same
   powerful operation required to the execution of his judgments, Job xii.
   17, xx. 21, etc. In brief, there is no prophecy nor prediction in the
   whole Scripture, no promise to the church or faithful, to whose
   accomplishment the free actions and concurrence of men are required,
   but evidently declareth that God disposeth of the hearts of men, ruleth
   their wills, inclineth their affections, and determines them freely to
   choose and do what he in his good pleasure hath decreed shall be
   performed; -- such as were the prophecies of deliverance from the
   Babylonish captivity by Cyrus, Isa. xlv.; of the conversion of the
   Gentiles; of the stability of the church, Matt. xvi.; of the
   destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, chap. xxiv.; with innumerable
   others. I will add only some few reasons for the close of this long
   discourse.

   This opinion, that God hath nothing but a general influence into the
   actions of men, not effectually moving their wills to this or that in
   particular, --

   First, Granteth a goodness of entity, or being, unto divers things,
   whereof God is not the author, as those special actions which men
   perform without his special concurrence; which is blasphemous. The
   apostle affirms that "of him are all things."

   Secondly, It denieth God to be the author of all moral goodness, for an
   action is good inasmuch as it is such an action in particular; [79]
   which that any is so, according to this opinion, is to be attributed
   merely to the will of man. The general influence of God moveth him no
   more to prayer than to evil communications tending to the corruption of
   good manners.

   Thirdly, It maketh all the decrees of God, whose execution dependeth on
   human actions, to be altogether uncertain, and his foreknowledge of
   such things to be fallible and easily to be deceived; so that there is
   no reconciliation possible to be hoped for betwixt these following and
   the like assertions:--

   external necessity in its actions," Rem. That is, God cannot lay such a
   necessity upon any thing as that it shall infallibly come to pass as he
   intendeth. See the contrary in the places cited.

   Whether the will and purpose of God may be resisted, and he be
   frustrate of his intentions.

   By the former steps is the altar of Ahaz set on the right hand of the
   altar of God, -- the Arminian idol, in a direct opposition, exalted to
   an equal pitch with the power and will of the Most High. I shall now
   present unto you the Spirit of God once more contending with the
   towering imaginations of poor mortals, about a transcendent privilege
   of greatness, glory, and power: for having made his decrees mutable,
   his prescience fallible, and almost quite divested him of his
   providence, as the sum and issue of all their endeavours, they affirm
   that his will may be resisted, he may fail of his intentions, be
   frustrate of his ends, -- he may and doth propose such things as he
   neither doth nor can at any time accomplish, and that because the
   execution of such acts of his will might haply clash against the
   freedom of the will of men; which, if it be not an expression of
   spiritual pride above all that ever the devil attempted in heaven,
   divines do not well explicate that sin of his. Now, because there may
   seem some difficulty in this matter, by reason of the several
   acceptations of the will of God, especially in regard of that whereby
   it is affirmed that his law and precepts are his will, which, alas! we
   all of us too often resist or transgress, I will unfold one distinction
   of the will of God, which will leave it clear what it is that the
   Arminians oppose, for which we count them worthy of so heavy a charge.

   "Divinum velle est ejus esse," say the schoolmen, [80] "The will of God
   is nothing but God willing;" not differing from his essence "secundem
   rem," in the thing itself, but only "secundem rationem," in that it
   importeth a relation to the thing willed. The essence of God, then,
   being a most absolute, pure, simple act or substance, his will
   consequently can be but simply one; whereof we ought to make neither
   division nor distinction. If that whereby it is signified were taken
   always properly and strictly for the eternal will of God, the
   differences hereof that are usually given are rather distinctions of
   the signification of the word than of the thing.

   In which regard they are not only tolerable, but simply necessary,
   because without them it is utterly impossible to reconcile some places
   of Scripture seemingly repugnant. In the 22d chapter of Genesis, verse
   2, God commandeth Abraham to take his only son Isaac, and offer him for
   a burnt-offering in the land of Moriah. Here the words of God are
   declarative of some will of God unto Abraham, who knew it ought to be,
   and little thought but that it should be, performed; but yet, when he
   actually addressed himself to his duty, in obedience to the will of
   God, he receiveth a countermand, verse 12, that he should not lay his
   hand upon the child to sacrifice him. The event plainly manifesteth
   that it was the will of God that Isaac should not be sacrificed; and
   yet notwithstanding, by reason of his command, Abraham seems before
   bound to believe that it was well-pleasing unto God that he should
   accomplish what he was enjoined. If the will of God in the Scripture be
   used but in one acceptation, here is a plain contradiction. Thus God
   commands Pharaoh to let his people go. Could Pharaoh think otherwise,
   nay, was he not bound to believe that it was the will of God that he
   should dismiss the Israelites at the first hearing of the message? Yet
   God affirms that he would harden his heart, that he should not suffer
   them to depart until he had showed his signs and wonders in the land of
   Egypt. To reconcile these and the like places of Scripture, both the
   ancient fathers and schoolmen, with modern divines, do affirm that the
   one will of God may be said to be divers or manifold, in regard of the
   sundry manners whereby he willeth those things to be done which he
   willeth, as also in other respects, and yet, taken in its proper
   signification, is simply one and the same. The vulgar distinction of
   God's secret and revealed will is such as to which all the others may
   be reduced; and therefore I have chosen it to insist upon.

   The secret will of God is his eternal, unchangeable purpose concerning
   all things which he hath made, to be brought by certain means to their
   appointed ends: of this himself affirmeth, that "his counsel shall
   stand, and he will do all his pleasure," Isa. xlvi. 10. This some call
   the absolute, efficacious will of God, the will of his good pleasure,
   always fulfilled; and indeed this is the only proper, eternal,
   constant, immutable will of God, whose order can neither be broken nor
   its law transgressed, so long as with him there is neither change nor
   shadow of turning.

   The revealed will of God containeth not his purpose and decree, but our
   duty, -- not what he will do according to his good pleasure, but what
   we should do if we will please him; and this, consisting in his word,
   his precepts and promises, belongeth to us and our children, that we
   may do the will of God. Now this, indeed, is rather to theleton than to
   thelema, that which God willeth, rather than his will, but termed so as
   we call that the will of a man which he hath determined shall be done:
   "This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the
   Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life," saith our
   Saviour, John vi. 40; that is, this is that which his will hath
   appointed. Hence it is called "voluntas signi," or the sign of his
   will, metaphorically only called his will, saith Aquinas; [81] for
   inasmuch as our commands are the signs of our wills, the same is said
   of the precepts of God. This is the rule of our obedience, and whose
   transgression makes an action sinful; for he hamartia estin he anomia,
   "sin is the transgression of a law," and that such a law as is given to
   the transgressor to be observed. Now, God hath not imposed on us the
   observation of his eternal decree and intention; which, as it is
   utterly impossible for us to transgress or frustrate, so were we
   unblamable if we should. A master requires of his servant to do what he
   commands, not to accomplish what he intends, which perhaps he never
   discovered unto him; nay, the commands of superiors are not always
   signs that the commander will have the things commanded actually
   performed (as in all precepts for trial), but only that they who are
   subjects to this command shall be obliged to obedience, as far as the
   sense of it doth extend. "Et hoc clarum est in præceptis divinis,"
   saith Durand, [82] etc., -- "And this is clear in the commands of God,"
   by which we are obliged to do what he commandeth; and yet it is not
   always his pleasure that the thing itself, in regard of the event,
   shall be accomplished, as we saw before in the examples of Pharaoh and
   Abraham.

   Now, the will of God in the first acceptation is said to be hid or
   secret, not because it is so always, for it is in some particulars
   revealed and made known unto us two ways:--

   First, By his word; as where God affirmeth that the dead shall rise. We
   doubt not but that they shall rise, and that it is the absolute will of
   God that they shall do so. Secondly, By the effects; for when any thing
   cometh to pass, we may cast the event on the will of God as its cause,
   and look upon it as a revelation of his purpose. Jacob's sons little
   imagined that it was the will of God by them to send their brother into
   Egypt; yet afterward Joseph tells them plainly it was not they, but God
   that sent him thither, Gen. xlv. 5. But it is said to be secret for two
   causes:-- First, Because for the most part it is so. There is nothing
   in divers issues declarative of God's determination but only the event,
   which, while it is future, is hidden to them who have faculties to
   judge of things past and present, but not to discern things for to
   come. Hence St James bids us not be too peremptory in our
   determinations that we will do this or that, not knowing how God will
   close with us for its performance. Secondly, It is said to be secret in
   reference to its cause, which for the most part is past our finding
   out: "His path is in the great waters, and his footsteps are not
   known."

   It appeareth, then, that the secret and revealed will of God are
   diverse in sundry respects, but chiefly in regard of their acts and
   their objects. First, In regard of their acts, the secret will of God
   is his eternal decree and determination concerning any thing to be done
   in its appointed time; his revealed will is an act whereby he declareth
   himself to love or approve any thing, whether ever it be done or no.
   Secondly, They are diverse in regard of their objects. The object of
   God's purpose and decree is that which is good in any kind, with
   reference to its actual existence, for it must infallibly be performed;
   but the object of his revealed will is that only which is morally good
   (I speak of it inasmuch as it approveth or commandeth), agreeing to the
   law and the gospel, and that considered only inasmuch as it is good;
   for whether it be ever actually performed or no is accidental to the
   object of God's revealed will.

   Now, of these two differences the first is perpetual, in regard of
   their several acts; but not so the latter. They are sometimes
   coincident in regard of their objects. For instance, God commandeth us
   to believe; here his revealed will is that we should so do: withal, he
   intendeth we shall do so; and therefore ingenerateth faith in our
   hearts that we may believe. Here his secret and revealed will are
   coincident; the former [83] being his precept that we should believe,
   the latter his purpose that we shall believe. In this case, I say, the
   object of the one and the other is the same, -- even what we ought to
   do, and what he will do. And this inasmuch as he hath "wrought all our
   works in us," Isa. xxvi. 12. They are our own works which he works in
   us; his act in us and by us is ofttimes our duty towards him. He
   commands us by his revealed will to walk in his statutes, and keep his
   laws; upon this he also promiseth that he will so effect all things,
   that of some this shall be performed: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, "A new heart
   also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
   will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you
   to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them." So
   that the self-same obedience of the people of God is here the object of
   his will, taken in either acceptation. And yet the precept of God is
   not here, as some learned men suppose, declarative of God's intention,
   for then it must be so to all to whom it is given; which evidently it
   is not, for many are commanded to believe on whom God never bestoweth
   faith. It is still to be looked upon as a mere declaration of our duty,
   its closing with God's intention being accidental unto it. There is a
   wide difference betwixt "Do such a thing," and, "You shall do it." If
   God's command to Judas to believe imported as much as, "It is my
   purpose and intention that Judas shall believe," it must needs
   contradict that will of God whereby he determined that Judas, for his
   infidelity, should go to his "own place." His precepts are in all
   obedience of us to be performed, but do not signify his will that we
   shall actually fulfil his commands. Abraham was not bound to believe
   that it was God's intention that Isaac should be sacrificed, but that
   it was his duty. There was no obligation on Pharaoh to think it was
   God's purpose the people should depart at the first summons; he had
   nothing to do with that: but there was one to believe that if he would
   please God, he must let them go. Hence divers things of good use in
   these controversies may be collected:--

   First, That God may command many things by his word which he never
   decreed that they should actually be performed; because, in such
   things, his words are not a revelation of his eternal decree and
   purpose, but only a declaration of some thing wherewith he is
   well-pleased, be it by us performed or no. In the fore-cited case he
   commanded Pharaoh to let his people go, and plagued him for refusing to
   obey his command. Hence we may not collect that God intended the
   obedience and conversion of Pharaoh by this his precept, but was
   frustrated of his intention, -- for the Scripture is evident and clear
   that God purposed by his disobedience to accomplish an end far
   different, even a manifestation of his glory by his punishment, -- but
   only that obedience unto his commands is pleasing unto him; as 1 Sam.
   xv. 22.

   Secondly, That the will of God to which our obedience is required is
   the revealed will of God contained in his word; whose compliance with
   his decree is such, that hence we learn three things tending to the
   execution of it:-- First, That it is the condition of the word of God,
   and the dispensation thereof, instantly to persuade to faith and
   obedience. Secondly, That it is our duty by all means to aspire to the
   performance of all things by it enjoined, and our fault if we do not.
   Thirdly, That God by these means will accomplish his eternal decree of
   saving his elect; and that he willeth the salvation of others, inasmuch
   as he calleth them unto the performance of the condition thereof. Now,
   our obedience is so to be regulated by this revealed will of God, that
   we may sin either by omission against its precepts or commission
   against its prohibitions; although by our so omitting or committing of
   any thing the secret will or purpose of God be fulfilled. Had Abraham
   disobeyed God's precept, when he was commanded to sacrifice his son
   Isaac, though God's will had been accomplished thereby, who never
   intended it, yet Abraham had grievously sinned against the revealed
   will of God, the rule of his duty. The holiness of our actions
   consisteth in a conformity unto his precepts, and not unto his
   purposes. On this ground Gregory affirmeth, [84] "That many fulfil the
   will of God" (that is, his intentions) "when they think to change it"
   (by transgressing his precepts); "and by resisting imprudently, obey
   God's purpose." And to show how merely we in our actions are tied to
   this rule of our duty, St Austin [85] shows how a man may do good in a
   thing cross to God's secret will, and evil in that which complieth with
   it, which he illustrates by the example of a sick parent having two
   children, the one wicked, who desires his father's death, the other
   godly, and he prays for his life. But the will of God is he shall die,
   agreeably to the desire of the wicked child; and yet it is the other
   who hath performed his duty, and done what is pleasing unto God.

   Thirdly, To return from this not unnecessary digression, that which we
   have now in agitation is the secret will of God, which we have before
   unfolded; and this it is that we charge the Arminians for affirming
   that it may be resisted, -- that is, that God may fail in his purposes,
   come short of what he earnestly intendeth, or be frustrated of his aim
   and end: as if, [when] he should determinately resolve the faith and
   salvation of any man, it is in the power of that man to make void his
   determination, and not believe, and not be saved. Now, it is only in
   cases of this nature, wherein our own free wills have an interest, that
   they thus limit and circumscribe the power of the Most High. In other
   things they grant his omnipotence to be of no less extent than others
   do; but in this case they are peremptory and resolute, without any
   colouring or tergiversation: for whereas there is a question proposed
   by the apostle, Rom. ix. 19, "Who hath resisted his will?" which that
   none hath or can he grants in the following verses, Corvinus affirms,
   [86] "It is only an objection of the Jews, rejected by the apostle;" --
   which is much like an answer young scholars usually give to some
   difficult place in Aristotle, when they cannot think of a better,
   "Loquitur ex aliorum sententia;" for there is no sign of any such
   rejection of it by the apostle in the whole following discourse; yea,
   and it is not the Jews that St Paul disputeth withal here, but weaker
   brethren concerning the Jews, which is manifest from the first verse of
   the next chapter, where he distinguisheth between "brethren" to whom
   and "Israel" of whom he spake. Secondly, He speaks of the Jews in the
   whole treatise in the third person, but of the disputer in the second.
   Thirdly, It is taken for a confessed principle between St Paul and the
   disputer, as he calls him, that the Jews were rejected, which surely
   themselves would not readily acknowledge. So that Corvinus rejects, as
   an objection of the Jews, a granted principle of St Paul and the other
   Christians of his time. With the like confidence the same author
   affirmeth, [87] "That they nothing doubt but that many things are not
   done which God would have to be done." Vorstius goes farther, teaching
   [88] "that not only many things are [not] done which he would have
   done, but also that many things are done which he would not have done."
   He means not our transgressing of his law, but God's failing in his
   purpose, as Corvinus clears it, acknowledging that the execution of
   God's will is suspended or hindered by man; to whom Episcopius
   subscribes. [89] As, for example, God purposeth and intendeth the
   conversion of a sinner, -- suppose it were Mary Magdalene; -- can this
   intention of his be crossed and his will resisted? "Yea," say the
   Arminians, "for God converts sinners by his grace." "But we can resist
   God when he would convert us by his grace," [90] say six of them
   jointly in their meeting at the Hague. "But some one may here object,"
   say they, "that thus God faileth of his intention, doth not attain the
   end at which he aims. We answer, This we grant." Or be it the salvation
   of men, they say, [91] "they are certain that God intendeth that for
   many which never obtain it;" that end he cannot compass.

   And here, methinks, they place God in a most unhappy condition, by
   affirming that they are often damned whom he would have to be saved,
   though he desires their salvation with a most vehement desire and
   natural affection, [92] -- such, I think, as crows have to the good of
   their young ones: for that there are in him such desires as are never
   fulfilled, [93] because not regulated by wisdom and justice, they
   plainly affirm; for although by his infinite power, perhaps, he might
   accomplish them, yet it would not become him so to do.

   Now, let any good-natured man, who hath been a little troubled for poor
   Jupiter in Homer, mourning for the death of his son Sarpedon, which he
   could not prevent, or hath been grieved for the sorrow of a distressed
   father, not able to remove the wickedness and inevitable ruin of an
   only son, drop one tear for the restrained condition of the God of
   heaven, who, when he would have all and every man in the world to come
   to heaven, to escape the torments of hell, and that with a serious
   purpose and intention that it shall be so, a vehement affection and
   fervent natural desire that it should be so, yet, being not in himself
   alone able to save one, must be forced to lose his desire, lay down his
   affection, change his purpose, and see the greatest part of them to
   perish everlastingly, [94] yea, notwithstanding that he had provided a
   sufficient means for them all to escape, with a purpose and intention
   that they should so do.

   In brief, their whole doctrine on this point is laid down by Corvinus,
   chap. iii., against Moulin, and the third section; where, first, he
   alloweth of the distinction of the will of God into that whereby he
   will have us do something, and that whereby he will do any thing
   himself. The first is nothing but his law and precepts; which we with
   him affirm may be said to be resisted, inasmuch as it is transgressed.
   The latter, he saith, if it respect any act of man's, may be considered
   as preceding that act, or following it; if preceding it, then it may be
   resisted, if man will not cooperate. Now, this is the will of God,
   whereby himself intendeth to do any thing; the sum of which distinction
   is this, "The will of God concerning the future being of any thing may
   be considered as it goeth before the actual existence of the thing
   itself, and in this regard it may be hindered or resisted; but as it is
   considered to follow any act of man, it is always fulfilled:" by which
   latter member, striving to mollify the harshness of the former, he runs
   himself into inexplicable nonsense, affirming that that act of the will
   of God whereby he intendeth men shall do any thing cannot be hindered
   after they have done it, -- that is, God hath irresistibly purposed
   they shall do it, provided they do it! In his following discourse,
   also, he plainly grants that there is no act of God's will about the
   salvation of men that may not be made void and of none effect, but only
   that general decree whereby he hath established an inseparable
   connection between faith and salvation, or whereby he hath appointed
   faith in Christ to be the means of attaining blessedness, which is only
   an immanent act of God's will, producing no outward effect; so that
   every act thereof that hath an external issue by human co-operation is
   frustrable and may fall to the ground: which in what direct opposition
   it stands to the word of God, let these following instances declare:--

   First, "Our God is in the heavens," saith the psalmist: "he hath done
   whatsoever he hath pleased," Ps. cxv. 3. Not only part, but all,
   whatsoever he pleased should come to pass, by any means. "He ruleth in
   the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will," Dan. iv. 17.
   The transposition of kingdoms is not without the mixture of divers free
   and voluntary actions of men, and yet in that great work God doth all
   that he pleaseth. Yea, before him "all the inhabitants of the earth are
   reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of
   heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
   hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?" verse 35. "My counsel," saith
   he, "shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure," Isa. xlvi. 10; "I
   have purposed, I will also do it," verse 11. Nay, so certain is he of
   accomplishing all his purposes, that he confirms it with an oath: "The
   Lord of hosts hath sworn, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to
   pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand," Isa. xiv. 24. And
   indeed it were a very strange thing, that God should intend what he
   foreseeth will never come to pass. But I confess this argument will not
   be pressing against the Arminians, who question that prescience; but
   yet, would they also would observe from the Scripture, that the failing
   of wicked men's counsels and intentions is a thing that God is said to
   "deride in heaven," as Ps. ii. 4. He threatens them with it. "Take
   counsel together," saith he, "and it shall come to nought; speak the
   word, and it shall not stand," Isa. viii. 10. See also chap. xxix. 7,
   8. And shall they be enabled to recriminate, and cast the like
   aspersion on the God of heaven? No, surely. Saith St Austin, [95] "Let
   us take heed we be not compelled to believe that Almighty God would
   have any thing done which doth not come to pass." To which truth, also,
   that the schoolmen have universally consented is showed by Alvarez,
   Disput. xxii., pro. 3. And these few instances will manifest the
   Arminian opposition to the word of God in this particular:--

                                  Chapter VI.

   How the whole doctrine of predestination is corrupted by the Arminians.

   The cause of all these quarrels, wherewith the Arminians and their
   abettors have troubled the church of Christ, comes next unto our
   consideration. The eternal predestination of Almighty God, that
   fountain of all spiritual blessings, of all the effects of God's love
   derived unto us through Christ, the demolishing of this rock of our
   salvation hath been the chief endeavour of all the patrons of human
   self-sufficiency; so to vindicate unto themselves a power and
   independent ability of doing good, of making themselves to differ from
   others, of attaining everlasting happiness, without going one step from
   without themselves. And this is their first attempt, to attain their
   second proposed end, of building a tower from the top whereof they may
   mount into heaven, whose foundation is nothing but the sand of their
   own free-will and endeavours. Quite on a sudden (what they have done in
   effect) to have taken away this divine predestination, name and thing,
   had been an attempt as noted as notorious, and not likely to attain the
   least success amongst men professing to believe the gospel of Christ;
   wherefore, suffering the name to remain, they have abolished the thing
   itself, and substituted another so unlike it in the room thereof, that
   any one may see they have gotten a blear-eyed Leah instead of Rachel,
   and hug a cloud instead of a Deity. The true doctrine itself hath been
   so excellently delivered by divers learned divines, so freed from all
   objections, that I shall only briefly and plainly lay it down, and that
   with special reference to the seventeenth article of our church, where
   it is clearly avowed; showing withal, -- which is my chief intention,
   -- how it is thwarted, opposed, and overthrown by the Arminians.
   Predestination, in the usual sense [in which] it is taken, is a part of
   God's providence concerning his creatures, distinguished from it by a
   double restriction:--

   First, In respect of their objects; for whereas the decree of
   providence comprehendeth his intentions towards all the works of his
   hands, predestination respecteth only rational creatures.

   Secondly, In regard of their ends; for whereas his providence directeth
   all creatures in general to those several ends to which at length they
   are brought, whether they are proportioned unto their nature or
   exceeding the sphere of their natural activity, predestination is
   exercised only in directing rational creatures to supernatural ends: so
   that, in general, it is the counsel, decree, or purpose of Almighty God
   concerning the last and supernatural end of his rational creatures, to
   be accomplished for the praise of his glory. But this also must receive
   a double restriction before we come precisely to what we in this place
   aim at: and these again in regard of the objects or the ends thereof.

   The object of predestination is all rational creatures, Now, these are
   either angels or men. Of angels I shall not treat. Secondly, The end by
   it provided for them is either eternal happiness or eternal misery. I
   speak only of the former, -- the act of God's predestination
   transmitting men to everlasting happiness: and in this restrained sense
   it differs not at all from election, and we may use them as synonyma,
   terms of the same importance; though, by some affirming that God
   predestinateth them to faith whom he hath chosen, they seem to be
   distinguished as the decrees of the end, and the means conducing
   thereunto, whereof the first is election, intending the end, and then
   takes place predestination, providing the means. But this exact
   distinction appeareth not directly in the Scripture.

   This election the word of God proposeth unto us as the gracious,
   immutable decree of Almighty God, whereby, before the foundation of the
   world, out of his own good pleasure, he chose certain men, determining
   to free them from sin and misery, to bestow upon them grace and faith,
   to give them unto Christ, to bring them to everlasting blessedness, for
   the praise of his glorious grace; or, as it is expressed in our church
   articles, "Predestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God,
   whereby, before the foundations of the world were laid, he hath
   constantly decreed by his counsel, secret to us, to deliver from curse
   and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and
   to bring them by Christ unto everlasting salvation, as vessels made
   unto honour; wherefore, they who are endued with so excellent a benefit
   of God be called according to God's purpose," etc.

   Now, to avoid prolixity, I will annex only such annotations as may
   clear the sense and confirm the truth of the article by the Scriptures,
   and show briefly how it is overthrown by the Arminians in every
   particular thereof:--

   First, The article, consonantly to the Scripture, affirmeth that it is
   an eternal decree, made before the foundations of the world were laid;
   so that by it we must needs be chosen before we were born, before we
   have done either good or evil. The words of the article are clear, and
   so also is the Scripture: "He hath chosen us in him before the
   foundation of the world," Eph. i. 4; "The children being not yet born,
   neither having done any good or evil, it was said," etc., Rom. ix. 11,
   12; "We are called with an holy calling, not according to our works,
   but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in
   Christ Jesus before the world began," 2 Tim. i. 9. Now, from hence it
   would undoubtedly follow that no good thing in us can be the cause of
   our election, for every cause must in order precede its effect; but all
   things whereof we by any means are partakers, inasmuch as they are
   ours, are temporary, and so cannot be the cause of that which is
   eternal. Things with that qualification must have reference to the sole
   will and good pleasure of God; which reference would break the neck of
   the Arminian election. Wherefore, to prevent such a fatal ruin, they
   deny the principle, -- to wit, that election is eternal. [96] So the
   Remonstrants, in their Apology: [97] "Complete election regardeth none
   but him that is dying; for this peremptory election decreeth the whole
   accomplishment and consummation of salvation, and therefore requireth
   in the object the finished course of faith and obedience," saith
   Grevinchovius; which is to make God's election nothing but an act of
   his justice, approving our obedience, and such an act as is incident to
   any weak man, who knows not what will happen in the next hour that is
   yet for to come. And is this post-destination that which is proposed to
   us in the Scripture as the unsearchable fountain of all God's love
   towards us in Christ? "Yea," [98] say they, "we acknowledge no other
   predestination to be revealed in the gospel besides that whereby God
   decreeth to save them who should persevere in faith;" that is, God's
   determination concerning their salvation is pendulous, until he find by
   experience that they will persevere in obedience. But I wonder why,
   seeing election is confessedly one of the greatest expressions of God's
   infinite goodness, love, and mercy towards us, if it follow our
   obedience, we have it not, like all other blessings and mercies,
   promised unto us. Is it not because such propositions as these,
   "Believe, Peter, and continue in the faith unto the end, and I will
   choose thee before the foundation of the world," are fitter for the
   writings of the Arminians than the word of God? Neither will we be
   their rivals in such an election, as from whence no fruit, [99] no
   effect, no consolation can be derived to any mortal man, whilst he
   lives in this world.

   Secondly, The article affirmeth that it is constant, -- that is, one
   immutable decree; agreeably also to the Scriptures, teaching but one
   purpose, but one foreknowledge, one good pleasure, one decree of God,
   concerning the infallible ordination of his elect unto glory; although
   of this decree there may be said to be two acts, -- one concerning the
   means, the other concerning the end, but both knit up in the
   "immutability of God's counsel," Heb. vi. 17. "The foundation of God
   standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his," 2
   Tim. ii. 19; "His gifts and calling are without recalling," not to be
   repented of, Rom. xi. 29. Now, what say our Arminians to this? Why, a
   whole multitude of notions and terms have they invented to obscure the
   doctrine. "Election," say they, [100] "is either legal or evangelical,
   general or particular, complete or incomplete, revocable or
   irrevocable, peremptory or not peremptory," with I know not how many
   more distinctions of one single eternal act of Almighty God, whereof
   there is neither "vola nec vestigium," sign or token, in the whole
   Bible, or any approved author. And to these quavering divisions they
   accommodate their doctrine, or rather they purposely invented them to
   make their errors unintelligible. Yet something agreeably thus they
   dictate: [101] "There is a complete election, belonging to none but
   those that are dying; and there is another, incomplete, common to all
   that believe: as the good things of salvation are incomplete which are
   continued whilst faith is continued, and revoked when that is denied,
   so election is incomplete in this life, and revocable." Again: "There
   are," they say in their Confession, [102] "three orders of believers
   and repenters in the Scripture, whereof some are beginners, others
   having continued for a time, and some perseverants. The first two
   orders are chosen verè, truly, but not absolutè prorsus, absolutely,
   but only for a time, -- so long as they will remain as they are; the
   third are chosen finally and peremptorily: for this act of God is
   either continued or interrupted, according as we fulfil the condition."
   But whence learned the Arminians this doctrine? Not one word of it from
   the word of truth; no mention there of any such desultory election, no
   speech of faith, but such as is consequent to one eternal irrevocable
   decree of predestination: They "believed" who were "ordained to eternal
   life," Acts xiii. 48. No distinction of men half and wholly elected,
   where it is affirmed that it is impossible the elect should be seduced,
   Matt. xxiv. 24, -- that none should snatch Christ's sheep out of his
   Father's hand, John x. 28, 29. What would they have more? God's purpose
   of election is sealed up, 2 Tim. ii. 19, and therefore cannot be
   revoked; it must stand firm, Rom. ix. 11, in spite of all opposition.
   Neither will reason allow us to think any immanent act of God to be
   incomplete or revocable, because of the mere alliance it hath with his
   very nature. But reason, Scripture, God himself, all must give place to
   any absurdities, if they stand in the Arminian way, bringing in their
   idol with shouts, and preparing his throne, by claiming the cause of
   their predestination to be in themselves.

   Thirdly, The article is clear that the object of this predestination is
   some particular men chosen out of mankind; that is, it is such an act
   of God as concerneth some men in particular, taking them, as it were,
   aside from the midst of their brethren, and designing them for some
   special end and purpose. The Scripture also aboundeth in asserting this
   verity, calling them that are so chosen a "few," Matt. xx. 16, which
   must needs denote some certain persons; and the "remnant according to
   election," Rom. xi. 5; those whom "the Lord knoweth to be his," 2 Tim.
   ii. 19; men "ordained to eternal life," Acts xiii. 48; "us," Rom. viii.
   39; those that are "written in the Lamb's book of life," Rev. xxi. 27;
   -- all which, and divers others, clearly prove that the number of the
   elect is certain, not only materially, as they say, [103] that there
   are so many, but formally also, that these particular persons, and no
   other, are they, which cannot be altered. Nay, the very nature of the
   thing itself doth so demonstratively evince it, that I wonder it can
   possibly be conceived under any other notion. To apprehend an election
   of men not circumscribed with the circumstance of particular persons is
   such a conceited, Platonical abstraction, as it seems strange that any
   one dares profess to understand that there should be a predestination,
   and none predestinated; an election, and none elected; a choice amongst
   many, yet none left or taken; a decree to save men, and yet thereby
   salvation destinated to no one man, either "re aut spe," in deed or in
   expectation. In a word, that there should be a purpose of God to bring
   men unto glory, standing inviolable, though never any one attained the
   purposed end, is such a riddle as no OEdipus can unfold. Now, such an
   election, such a predestination, have the Arminians substituted in the
   place of God's everlasting decree. "We deny," [104] say they, "that
   God's election extendeth itself to any singular persons as singular
   persons;" that is, that any particular persons, as Peter, Paul, John,
   are by it elected. No; how, then? Why, [105] "God hath appointed,
   without difference, to dispense the means of faith; and as he seeth
   these persons to believe or not to believe by the use of those means,
   so at length he determineth of them," as saith Corvinus. Well, then,
   God chooseth no particular man to salvation, but whom he seeth
   believing by his own power, with the help only of such means as are
   afforded unto others who never believe; and as he maketh himself thus
   differ from them by a good use of his own abilities, so also he may be
   reduced again unto the same predicament, and then his election, which
   respecteth not him in his person, but only his qualification, quite
   vanisheth. But is this God's decree of election? "Yes," say they; and
   make a doleful complaint that any other doctrine should be taught in
   the church. [106] "It is obtruded," say the true-born sons of Arminius,
   "on the church as a most holy doctrine, that God, by an absolute,
   immutable decree, from all eternity, out of his own good pleasure, hath
   chosen certain persons, and those but few in comparison, without any
   respect had to their faith and obedience, and predestinated them to
   everlasting life." But what so great exception is this doctrine liable
   unto, what wickedness doth it include, that it should not be accounted
   most holy? Nay, is not only the matter but the very terms of it
   contained in the Scripture? Doth it not say the elect are few, and they
   chosen before the foundation of the world, without any respect to their
   obedience or any thing that they had done, out of God's mere gracious
   good pleasure, that his free purpose according to election might stand,
   even because so it pleased him; and this that they might be holy,
   believe, and be sanctified, that they might come unto Christ, and by
   him be preserved unto everlasting life? Yea, this is that which galls
   them: [107] "No such will can be ascribed unto God, whereby he so
   willeth any one to be saved as that thence their salvation should be
   sure and infallible," saith the father of those children.

   Well, then, let St Austin's definition be quite rejected, [108] "That
   predestination is a preparation of such benefits whereby some are most
   certainly freed and delivered from sin and brought to glory;" and that
   also of St Paul, "That (by reason of this) nothing can separate us from
   the love of God, which is in Christ." What is this election in your
   judgment? [109] "Nothing but a decree whereby God hath appointed to
   save them that believe in Christ," saith Corvinus, be they who they
   will; or a general purpose of God, whereby he hath ordained faith in
   Christ to be the means of salvation. Yea, but this belongs to Judas as
   well as to Peter. This decree carrieth as equal an aspect to those that
   are damned as to those that are saved. Salvation, under the condition
   of faith in Christ, was also proposed to them; but was Judas and all
   his company elected? How came they, then, to be seduced and perish?
   That any of God's elect go to hell is as yet a strange assertion in
   Christianity. Notwithstanding this decree, none may believe, or all
   that do may fall away, and so none at all be saved; which is a strange
   kind of predestination: or all may believe, continue in faith, and be
   saved; which were a more strange kind of election.

   We, poor souls, thought hitherto that we might have believed, according
   unto Scripture, that some by this purpose were in a peculiar manner
   made the Father's ("Thine they were"), and by him given unto Christ,
   that he might bring them unto glory; and that these men were so certain
   and unchangeable a number, that not only God "knoweth them" as being
   "his," but also that Christ "calleth them by name," John x. 3, and
   looketh that none taketh them out of his hand. We never imagined before
   that Christ hath been the mediator of an uncertain covenant, because
   there are no certain persons covenanted withal but such as may or may
   not fulfil the condition. We always thought that some had been
   separated before by God's purpose from the rest of the perishing world,
   that Christ might lay down his life for his "friends," for his "sheep,"
   for them that were "given him" of his Father. But now it should seem he
   was ordained to be a king when it was altogether uncertain whether he
   should ever have any subjects, to be a head without a body, or to such
   a church whose collection and continuance depend wholly and solely on
   the will of men.

   These are doctrines that I believe searchers of the Scripture had
   scarce ever been acquainted withal, had they not lighted on such
   expositors as teach, [110] "That the only cause why God loveth" (or
   chooseth) "any person is, because the honesty, faith, and piety
   wherewith, according to God's command and his own duty, he is endued,
   are acceptable to God;" which, though we grant it true of God's
   consequent or approving love, yet surely there is a divine love
   wherewith he looks upon us otherwise, when he gives us unto Christ,
   else either our giving unto Christ is not out of love, or we are pious,
   just, and faithful before we come unto him, -- that is, we have no need
   of him at all. Against either way, though we may blot these testimonies
   out of our hearts, yet they will stand still recorded in holy
   Scripture, -- namely, that God so loved us when we were his "enemies,"
   Rom. v. 10, "sinners," verse 8, of no "strength," verse 6; that "he
   gave his only-begotten Son" to die, "that we should not perish, but
   have everlasting life," John iii. 16. But of this enough.

   Fourthly, Another thing that the article asserteth according to the
   Scripture is, that there is no other cause of our election but God's
   own counsel. It recounteth no motives in us, nothing impelling the will
   of God to choose some out of mankind, rejecting others, but his own
   decree, -- that is, his absolute will and good pleasure; so that as
   there is no cause, in any thing without himself, why he would create
   the world or elect any at all, -- for he doth all these things for
   himself, for the praise of his own glory, -- so there is no cause in
   singular elected persons why God should choose them rather than others.
   He looked upon all mankind in the same condition, vested with the same
   qualifications, or rather without any at all; for it is the children
   not yet born, before they do either good or evil, that are chosen or
   rejected, his free grace embracing the one and passing over the other.
   Yet here we must observe, that although God freely, without any desert
   of theirs, chooseth some men to be partakers both of the end and the
   means, yet he bestoweth faith, or the means, on none but for the merit
   of Christ; neither do any attain the end or salvation but by their own
   faith, through that righteousness of his. The free grace of God
   notwithstanding, choosing Jacob when Esau is rejected, the only
   antecedent cause of any difference between the elect and reprobates,
   remaineth firm and unshaken; and surely, unless men were resolved to
   trust wholly to their own bottoms, to take nothing gratis at the hands
   of God, they would not endeavour to rob him of his glory, of having
   mercy on whom he will have mercy, of loving us without our desert
   before the world began. If we must claim an interest in obtaining the
   temporal acts of his favour by our own endeavours, yet, oh, let us
   grant him the glory of being good unto us, only for his own sake, when
   we were in his hand as the clay in the hand of the potter. What made
   this piece of clay fit for comely service, and not a vessel wherein
   there is no pleasure, but the power and will of the Framer? It is
   enough, yea, too much, for them to repine and say, "Why hast thou made
   us thus?" who are vessels fitted for wrath. Let not them who are
   prepared for honour exalt themselves against him, and sacrifice to
   their own nets, as the sole providers of their glory. But so it is:
   human vileness will still be declaring itself, by claiming a worth no
   way due unto it; of a furtherance of which claim if the Arminians be
   not guilty, let the following declaration of their opinions in this
   particular determine:--

   "We confess," say they, [111] "roundly, that faith, in the
   consideration of God choosing us unto salvation, doth precede, and not
   follow as a fruit of election." So that whereas Christians have
   hitherto believed that God bestoweth faith on them that are chosen, it
   seems now it is no such matter, but that those whom God findeth to
   believe, upon the stock of their own abilities, he afterward chooseth.
   Neither is faith, in their judgment, only required as a necessary
   condition in him that is to be chosen, but as a cause moving the will
   of God to elect him that hath it, [112] "as the will of the judge is
   moved to bestow a reward on him who according to the law hath deserved
   it," as Grevinchovius speaks: which words of his, indeed, Corvinus
   strives to temper, but all in vain, though he wrest them contrary to
   the intention of the author; for with him agree all his fellows. [113]
   "The one only absolute cause of election is, not the will of God, but
   the respect of our obedience," saith Episcopius. At first they required
   nothing but faith, and that as a condition, not as a cause; [114] then
   perseverance in faith, which at length they began to call obedience,
   comprehending all our duty to the precepts of Christ: for the cause,
   say they, of this love to any person, is the righteousness, faith, and
   piety wherewith he is endued; which being all the good works of a
   Christian, they, in effect, affirm a man to be chosen for them, -- that
   our good works are the cause of election; which whether it were ever so
   grossly taught, either by Pelagians or Papists, I something doubt.

   And here observe, that this doth not thwart my former assertion, where
   I showed that they deny the election of any particular persons, which
   here they seem to grant upon a foresight of their faith and good works;
   for there is not any one person, as such a person, notwithstanding all
   this, that in their judgment is in this life elected, but only as he is
   considered with those qualifications of which he may at any time divest
   himself, and so become again to be no more elected than Judas.

   The sum of their doctrine in this particular is laid down by one of
   ours in a tract entitled "God's Love to Mankind," etc.; a book full of
   palpable ignorance, gross sophistry, and abominable blasphemy, whose
   author seems to have proposed nothing unto himself but to rake all the
   dunghills of a few of the most invective Arminians, and to collect the
   most filthy scum and pollution of their railings to cast upon the truth
   of God; and, under I know not what self-coined pretences, belch out
   odious blasphemies against his holy name.

   The sum, saith he, of all these speeches (he cited to his purpose) is,
   [115] "That there is no decree of saving men but what is built on God's
   foreknowledge of the good actions of men." No decree? No, not that
   whereby God determineth to give some unto Christ, to ingraft them in
   him by faith, and bring them by him unto glory; which giveth light to
   that place of Arminius, where he affirmeth, [116] "That God loveth none
   precisely to eternal life but considered as just, either with legal or
   evangelical righteousness." Now, to love one to eternal life is to
   destinate one to obtain eternal life by Christ, and so it is coincident
   with the former assertion, that our election, or choosing unto grace
   and glory, is upon the foresight of our good works; which contains a
   doctrine so contradictory to the words and meaning of the apostle, Rom.
   ix. 11, condemned in so many councils, suppressed by so many edicts and
   decrees of emperors and governors, opposed as a pestilent heresy, ever
   since it was first hatched, by so many orthodox fathers and learned
   schoolmen, so directly contrary to the doctrine of this church, so
   injurious to the grace and supreme power of Almighty God, that I much
   wonder any one, in this light of the gospel and flourishing time of
   learning, should be so boldly ignorant or impudent as to broach it
   amongst Christians. To prove this to be a heresy exploded by all
   orthodox and catholic antiquity were to light a candle in the sun; for
   it cannot but be known to all and every one who ever heard or read any
   thing of the state of Christ's church after the rising of the Pelagian
   tumults. [117]

   To accumulate testimonies of the ancients is quite beside my purpose. I
   will only add the confession of Bellarmine, [118] a man otherwise not
   over-well affected to truth. "Predestination," saith he, "from the
   foresight of works, cannot be maintained unless we should suppose
   something in the righteous man, which should make him differ from the
   wicked, that he doth not receive from God; which truly all the fathers
   with unanimous consent do reject." But we have a more sure testimony,
   to which we will take heed, even the holy Scripture, pleading strongly
   for God's free and undeserved grace.

   First, our Saviour Christ, Matt. xi. 26, declaring how God revealeth
   the gospel unto some, which is hidden from others (a special fruit of
   election), resteth in his will and good pleasure as the only cause
   thereof: "Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight." So,
   comforting his "little flock," Luke xii. 32, he bids them fear not,
   "for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom;" --
   "His good pleasure is the only cause why his kingdom is prepared for
   you rather than others." But is there no other reason of this
   discrimination? No; he doth it all "that his purpose according to
   election might stand" firm, Rom. ix. 11; for we are "predestinated
   according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will," Eph. i. 11. But did not this counsel of God
   direct him to choose us rather than others because we had something to
   commend us more than they? No; "The Lord did not set his love upon you,
   nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; but
   because the Lord loved you," Deut. vii. 7, 8. "He hath mercy on whom he
   will have mercy;" yea, "the children being not yet born, neither having
   done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
   might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said unto
   her, The elder shall serve the younger: as it is written, Jacob have I
   loved, but Esau have I hated," Rom. ix. 11-13. In brief, wherever there
   is any mention of election or predestination, it is still accompanied
   with the purpose, love, or will of God; his foreknowledge, whereby he
   knoweth them that are his; his free power and supreme dominion over all
   things. Of our faith, obedience, or any thing importing so much, not
   one syllable, no mention, unless it be as the fruit and effect thereof.
   It is the sole act of his free grace and good pleasure, that "he might
   make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy," Rom. ix.
   23. For this only end hath he "saved us, and called us with an holy
   calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose
   and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
   2 Tim. i. 9. Even our calling is free and undeserved, because flowing
   from that most free grace of election, whereof we are partakers before
   we are [i.e., exist]. It were needless to heap up more testimonies in a
   thing so clear and evident. When God and man stand in competition who
   shall be accounted the cause of an eternal good, we may be sure the
   Scripture will pass the verdict on the part of the Most High. And the
   sentence, in this case, may be derived from thence by these following
   reasons:--

   First, If final perseverance in faith and obedience be the cause of, or
   a condition required unto, election, then none can be said in this life
   to be elected; for no man is a final perseverer until he be dead, until
   he hath finished his course and consummated the faith. But certain it
   is that it is spoken of some in the Scripture that they are even in
   this life elected: "Few are chosen," Matt. xx. 16; "For the elect's
   sake those days shall be shortened," chap. xxiv. 22; "And shall, if it
   were possible, deceive the very elect," verse 24, -- where it is
   evident that election is required to make one persevere in the faith,
   but nowhere is perseverance in the faith required to election; yea, and
   Peter gives us all a command that we should give all diligence to get
   an assurance of our "election," even in this life, 2 Pet. i. 10: and,
   therefore, surely it cannot be a decree presupposing consummated faith
   and obedience.

   Secondly, Consider two things of our estate, before the first temporal
   act of God's free grace (for grace is no grace if it be not free),
   which is the first effect of our predestination, comprehendeth us:--
   First, "Were we better than others." No, in no wise: both Jews and
   Gentiles were all under sin," Rom. iii. 9. "There is no difference; for
   all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God," verse 23; --
   being all "dead in trespasses and sins," Eph. ii. 1; being "by nature
   the children of wrath, even as others," verse 3; "far off," until we
   are "made nigh by the blood of Christ," verse 13. We were "enemies"
   against God, Rom. v. 10; Tit. iii. 3. And look what desert there is in
   us with these qualifications, when our vocation, the first effect of
   our predestination, as St Paul showeth, Rom. viii. 30, and as I shall
   prove hereafter, separateth us from the world of unbelievers. So much
   there is in respect of predestination itself; so that if we have any
   way deserved it, it is by being sinners, enemies, children of wrath,
   and dead in trespasses. These are our deserts; this is the glory,
   whereof we ought to be ashamed. But, secondly, When they are in the
   same state of actual alienation from God, yet then, in respect of his
   purpose to save them by Christ, some are said to be his: "Thine they
   were, and thou gavest them me," John xvii. 6; -- they were his before
   they came unto Christ by faith; the sheep of Christ before they are
   called, for he "calleth his sheep by name," chap. x. 3; before they
   come into the flock or congregation, for "other sheep," saith he, "I
   have, which are not of this fold, them also must I bring," chap. x. 16;
   -- to be beloved of God before they love him: "Herein is love, not that
   we loved God, but that he loved us," 1 John iv. 10. Now, all this must
   be with reference to God's purpose of bringing them unto Christ, and by
   him unto glory; which we see goeth before all their faith and
   obedience.

   Thirdly, Election is an eternal act of God's will: "He hath chosen us
   before the foundation of the world," Eph. i. 4; consummated
   antecedently to all duty of ours, Rom. ix. 11. Now, every cause must,
   in order of nature, precede its effect; nothing hath an activity in
   causing before it hath a being. Operation in every kind is a second
   act, flowing from the essence of a thing which is the first. But all
   our graces and works, our faith, obedience, piety, and charity, are all
   temporal, of yesterday, the same standing with ourselves, and no
   longer; and therefore cannot be the cause of, no, nor so much as a
   condition necessarily required for, the accomplishment of an eternal
   act of God, irrevocably established before we are.

   Fourthly, If predestination be for faith foreseen, these three things,
   with divers such absurdities, will necessarily follow:-- First, That
   election is not of "him that calleth," as the apostle speaks, Rom. ix.
   11, -- that is, of the good pleasure of God, who calleth us with a holy
   calling, -- but of him that is called; for, depending on faith, it must
   be his whose faith is, that doth believe. Secondly, God cannot have
   mercy on whom he win have mercy, for the very purpose of it is thus
   tied to the qualities of faith and obedience, so that he must have
   mercy only on believers antecedently to his decree. Which, thirdly,
   hinders him from being an absolute free agent, and doing of what he
   will with his own, -- of having such a power over us as the potter hath
   over his clay; for he finds us of different matter, one clay, another
   gold, when he comes to appoint us to different uses and ends.

   Fifthly, God sees no faith, no obedience, perseverance, nothing but sin
   and wickedness, in any man, but what himself intendeth graciously and
   freely to bestow upon him; for "faith is not of ourselves, it is the
   gift of God;" it is "the work of God, that we believe," John vi. 29; he
   "blesseth us with all spiritual blessings in Christ," Eph. i. 3. Now,
   all these gifts and graces God bestoweth only upon those whom he hath
   antecedently ordained to everlasting life: for "the election obtained
   it, and the rest were blinded," Rom. xi. 7; "The Lord added to the
   church daily such as should be saved"' Acts ii. 47. Therefore, surely,
   God chooseth us not because he foreseeth those things in us, seeing he
   bestoweth those graces because he hath chosen us. "Wherefore," [119]
   saith Austin, "doth Christ say, Ye have not chosen me, but I have
   chosen you,' but because they did not choose him that he should choose
   them; but he chose them that they might choose him." We choose Christ
   by faith; God chooseth us by his decree of election. The question is,
   Whether we choose him because he hath chosen us, or he chooseth us
   because we have chosen him, and so indeed choose ourselves? We affirm
   the former, and that because our choice of him is a gift he himself
   bestoweth only on them whom he hath chosen.

   Sixthly, and principally, The effects of election, infallibly following
   it, cannot be the causes of election, certainly preceding it. This is
   evident, for nothing can be the cause and the effect of the same thing,
   before and after itself. But all our faith, our obedience, repentance,
   good works, are the effects of election, flowing from it as their
   proper fountain, erected on it as the foundation of this spiritual
   building; and for this the article of our church is evident and clear.
   "Those," saith it, "that are endued with this excellent benefit of God
   are called according to God's purpose, are justified freely, are made
   the sons of God by adoption; they be made like the image of Christ;
   they walk religiously in good works," etc. Where, first, they are said
   to be partakers of this benefit of election, and then by virtue thereof
   to be entitled to the fruition of all those graces. Secondly, it saith,
   "Those who are endued with this benefit enjoy those blessings;"
   intimating that election is the rule whereby God proceedeth in
   bestowing those graces, restraining the objects of the temporal acts of
   God's special favour to them only whom his eternal decree doth embrace.
   Both these, indeed, are denied by the Arminians; which maketh a farther
   discovery of their heterodoxies in this particular. [120] "You say,"
   saith Arminius to Perkins, "that election is the rule of giving or not
   giving of faith; and, therefore, election is not of the faithful, but
   faith of the elect: but by your leave this I must deny." But yet,
   whatever it is the sophistical heretic here denies, either antecedent
   or conclusion, he falls foul on the word of God. "They believed,'?"
   saith the Holy Ghost, "who were ordained to eternal life,'?" Acts xiii.
   48; and, "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved,"
   chap. ii. 47. From both which places it is evident that God bestoweth
   faith only on them whom he hath pre-ordained to eternal life; but most
   clearly, Rom. viii. 29, 30, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. Moreover whom he
   did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified." St Austin
   interpreted this place by adding in every link of the chain, "Only
   those." However, the words directly import a precedency of
   predestination before the bestowing of other graces, and also a
   restraint of those graces to them only that are so predestinated. Now,
   the inference from this is not only for the form logical, but for the
   matter also; it containeth the very words of Scripture, "Faith is of
   God's elect," Tit. i. 1.

   For the other part of the proposition, that faith and obedience are the
   fruits of our election, they cannot be more peremptory in its denial
   than the Scripture is plentiful in its confirmation: "He hath chosen us
   in Christ, that we should be holy," Eph. i. 4; not because we were
   holy, but that we should be so. Holiness, whereof faith is the root and
   obedience the body, is that whereunto, and not for which, we are
   elected. The end and the meritorious cause of any one act cannot be the
   same; they have divers respects, and require repugnant conditions.
   Again; we are "predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ," verse 5. Adoption is that whereby we are assumed into the
   family of God, when before we are "foreigners, aliens, strangers, afar
   off;" which we see is a fruit of our predestination, though it be the
   very entrance into that estate wherein we begin first to please God in
   the least measure. Of the same nature are all those places of holy writ
   which speak of God's giving some unto Christ, of Christ's sheep hearing
   his voice, and others not hearing, because they are not of his sheep;
   all which, and divers other invincible reasons, I willingly omit, with
   sundry other false assertions and heretical positions of the Arminians
   about this fundamental article of our religion, concluding this chapter
   with the following scheme:--

   S. S.

   Lib. Arbit.

   "Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the
   image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
   Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
   called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
   glorified." So that "nothing shall be able to separate us from the love
   of God, which is in Christ Jesus," Rom. viii. 29, 30, 39.

   "No such will can be ascribed unto God, whereby he so would have any to
   be saved, that from thence his salvation should be sure and
   infallible," Armin. "I acknowledge no sense, no perception of any such
   election in this life," Grevinch. "We deny that God's election unto
   salvation extendeth itself to singular persons," Rem. Coll. Hag.

   "He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we
   should be holy," Eph. i. 4.

   "As we are justified by faith, so we are not elected but by faith,"
   Grevinch.

   "Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
   grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began," 2
   Tim. i. 9.

   "We profess roundly that faith is considered by God as a condition
   preceding election, and not following as a fruit thereof," Rem. Coll.
   Hag.

   "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or
   evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
   works, but of him that calleth," etc., Rom. ix. 11. "All that the
   Father giveth me shall come to me," John vi. 37

   "The sole and only cause of election is not the will of God, but the
   respect of our obedience," Episcop. "For the cause of this love to any
   person is, [that] the goodness, faith, and piety, wherewith, according
   to God's command and his own duty, he is endued, are pleasing to God,"
   Rem. Apol.

   "Many are called, but few are chosen," Matt. xxii. 14. "Fear not,
   little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
   kingdom," Luke xii. 32.

   "God hath determined to grant the means of salvation unto all without
   difference; and according as he foreseeth men will use those means, so
   he determineth of them," Corv.

   "What hast thou that thou didst not receive?" 1 Cor. iv. 7. "Are we
   better than they? No, in no wise," Rom. iii. 9. But we are
   "predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, according
   to the good pleasure of his will," Eph. i. 5; John vi. 37-39, x. 3,
   xiii. 18, xvii. 6; Acts xiii. 48; Tit. i. 1; 2 Tim. ii. 19; James i.
   17, 18, etc.

   The sum of their doctrine is: God hath appointed the obedience of faith
   to be the means of salvation. If men fulfil this condition, he
   determineth to save them, which is their election; but if, after they
   have entered the way of godliness, they fall from it, they lose also
   their predestination. If they will return again, they are chosen anew;
   and if they can hold out to the end, then, and for that continuance,
   they are peremptorily elected, or postdestinated, after they are saved.
   Now, whether these positions may be gathered from those places of
   Scripture which deliver this doctrine, let any man judge.

                                  Chapter VII.

   Of original sin and the corruption of nature.

   Herod the Great, imparting his counsel of rebuilding the temple unto
   the Jews, they much feared he would never be able to accomplish his
   intention, [121] but, like an unwise builder, having demolished the old
   before he had sat down and cast up his account whether he were able to
   erect a new, they should (by his project) be deprived of a temple.
   Wherefore, to satisfy their jealousies, he resolved, as he took down
   any part of the other, presently to erect a portion of the new in the
   place thereof. Right so the Arminians, determining to demolish the
   building of divine providence, grace, and favour, by which men have
   hitherto ascended into heaven, and fearing lest we should be troubled,
   finding ourselves on a sudden deprived of that wherein we reposed our
   confidence for happiness, they have, by degrees, erected a Babylonish
   tower in the room thereof, whose top, they would persuade us, shall
   reach unto heaven. First, therefore, the foundation-stones they bring
   forth, crying, "Hail, hail," unto them, and pitch them on the sandy,
   rotten ground of our own natures. Now, because heretofore some wise
   master-builders had discovered this ground to be very unfit to be the
   basis of such a lofty erection, by reason of a corrupt issue of blood
   and filth arising in the midst thereof, and overspreading the whole
   platform, to encourage men to an association in this desperate attempt,
   they proclaim to all that there is no such evil fountain in the plain
   which they have chosen for the foundation of their proud building,
   setting up itself against the knowledge of God in plain terms. Having
   rejected the providence of God from being the original of that goodness
   of entity which is in our actions, and his predestination from being
   the cause of that moral and spiritual goodness wherewith any of them
   are clothed, they endeavour to draw the praise of both to the rectitude
   of their nature and the strength of their own endeavours. But this
   attempt, in the latter case, being thought to be altogether vain,
   because of the disability and corruption of nature, by reason of
   original sin, propagated unto us all by our first parents, whereby it
   is become wholly void of integrity and holiness, and we all become wise
   and able to do evil, but to do good have no power, no understanding;
   therefore, they utterly reject this imputation of an inherent, original
   guilt, and demerit of punishment, as an enemy to our upright and
   well-deserving condition. And oh, that they were as able to root it out
   of the hearts of all men, that it should never more be there, as they
   have been to persuade the heads of divers that it was never there at
   all!

   If any would know how considerable this article concerning original sin
   hath ever been accounted in the church of Christ, let him but consult
   the writings of St Augustine, Prosper, Hilary, Fulgentius, any of those
   learned fathers whom God stirred up to resist, and enabled to overcome,
   the spreading Pelagian heresy, or look on those many councils, edicts,
   decrees of emperors, wherein that heretical doctrine of denying this
   original corruption is condemned, cursed, and exploded. Now, amongst
   those many motives they had to proceed so severely against this heresy,
   one especially inculcated deserves our consideration, namely, --

   That it overthrew the necessity of Christ's coming into the world to
   redeem mankind. It is sin only that makes a Saviour necessary; and
   shall Christians tolerate such an error as, by direct consequence,
   infers the coming of Jesus Christ into the world to be needless? My
   purpose for the present is not to allege any testimonies of this kind;
   but, holding myself close to my first intention, to show how far in
   this article, as well as others, the Arminians have apostated from the
   pure doctrine of the word of God, the consent of orthodox divines, and
   the confession of this church of England.

   In the ninth article of our church, which is concerning original sin, I
   observe especially four things:-- First, That it is an inherent evil,
   the fault and corruption of the nature of every man. Secondly, That it
   is a thing not subject or conformable to the law of God, but hath in
   itself, even after baptism, the nature of sin. Thirdly, That by it we
   are averse from God, and inclined to all manner of evil. Fourthly, That
   it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. All which are frequently and
   evidently taught in the word of God, and every one denied by the
   Arminians, as it may appear by these instances, in some of them:--

   First, That it is an inherent sin and pollution of nature, having a
   proper guilt of its own, making us responsible to the wrath of God, and
   not a bare imputation of another's fault to us his posterity: which,
   because it would reflect upon us all with a charge of a native
   imbecility and insufficiency to good, is by these self-idolizers quite
   exploded.

   [122] "Infants are simply in that estate in which Adam was before his
   fall," saith Venator. [123] "Neither is it at all considerable whether
   they be the children of believers or of heathens and infidels; for
   infants, as infants, have all the same innocency," say they jointly, in
   their Apology: nay, more plainly, [124] "It can be no fault wherewith
   we are born." In which last expression these bold innovators, with one
   dash of their pens, have quite overthrown a sacred verity, an
   apostolic, catholic, fundamental article of Christian religion. But,
   truly, to me there are no stronger arguments of the sinful corruption
   of our nature than to see such nefarious issues of unsanctified hearts.
   Let us look, then, to the word of God confounding this Babylonish
   design.

   First, That the nature of man, which at first was created pure and
   holy, after the image of God, endowed with such a rectitude and
   righteousness as was necessary and due unto it, to bring it unto that
   supernatural end to which it was ordained, is now altogether corrupted
   and become abominable, sinful, and averse from goodness, and that this
   corruption or concupiscence is originally inherent in us and derived
   from our first parents, is plentifully delivered in holy writ, as that
   which chiefly compels us to a self-denial, and drives us unto Christ.
   "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
   me," saith David, Ps. li. 5. Where, for the praise of God's goodness
   towards him, he begins with the confession of his native perverseness,
   and of the sin wherein he was wrapped before he was born. Neither was
   this peculiar to him alone; he had it not from the particular iniquity
   of his next progenitors, but by an ordinary propagation from the common
   parent of us all; though in some of us, Satan, by this Pelagian attempt
   for hiding the disease, hath made it almost incurable: for even those
   infants of whose innocency the Arminians boast are unclean in the
   verdict of St Paul, 1 Cor. vii. 14, if not sanctified by an interest in
   the promise of the covenant; and no unclean thing shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. [125] "The weakness of the members of infants is
   innocent, and not their souls;" they want nothing, but that the members
   of their bodies are not as yet ready instruments of sin. They are not
   sinful only by external denomination, -- accounted so because of the
   imputation of Adam's actual transgression unto them; for they have all
   an uncleanness in them by nature, Job xiv. 4, from which they must be
   "cleansed with the washing of water by the word," Eph. v. 20. Their
   whole nature is overspread with such a pollution as is proper only to
   sin inherent, and doth not accompany sin imputed; as we may see in the
   example of our Saviour, who was pure, immaculate, holy, undefiled, and
   yet "the iniquity of us all" was imputed unto him. Hence are those
   phrases of "washing away sin," Acts xxii. 16; of "cleansing filth," 1
   Pet. iii. 21, Tit. iii. 5. Something there is in them, as soon as they
   are born, excluding them from the kingdom of heaven; for except they
   also be born again of the Spirit, they shall not enter into it, John
   iii. 5.

   Secondly, The opposition that is made between the righteousness of
   Christ and the sin of Adam, Rom. v., which is the proper seat of this
   doctrine, showeth that there is in our nature an inbred sinful
   corruption; for the sin of Adam holds such relation unto sinners,
   proceeding from him by natural propagation, as the righteousness of
   Christ doth unto them who are born again of him by spiritual
   regeneration. But we are truly, intrinsically, and inherently
   sanctified by the Spirit and grace of Christ; and therefore there is no
   reason why, being so often in this chapter called sinners, because of
   this original sin, we should cast it off, as if we were concerned only
   by an external denomination, for the right institution of the
   comparison and its analogy quite overthrows the solitary imputation.

   Thirdly, All those places of Scripture which assert the proneness of
   our nature to all evil, and the utter disability that is in us to do
   any good, that wretched opposition to the power of godliness, wherewith
   from the womb we are replenished, confirms the same truth. But of these
   places I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.

   Fourthly, The flesh, in the Scripture phrase, is a quality (if I may so
   say) inherent in us; for that, with its concupiscence, is opposed to
   the Spirit and his holiness, which is certainly inherent in us. Now,
   the whole man by nature is flesh; for "that which is born of the flesh
   is flesh," John iii. 6; -- it is an inhabiting thing, a thing that
   "dwelleth" within us, Rom. vii. 17. In brief, this vitiosity,
   sinfulness, and corruption of our nature is laid open, -- First, By all
   those places which cast an aspersion of guilt, or desert of punishment,
   or of pollution, on nature itself; as Eph. ii. 1, 3, we are "dead in
   trespasses and sins," being "by nature the children of wrath, even as
   others," being wholly encompassed by a "sin that doth easily beset us."
   Secondly, By them which fix this original pravity in the heart, will,
   mind, and understanding, Eph. iv. 18; Rom. xii. 2; Gen. vi. 5. Thirdly,
   By those which positively decipher this natural depravation, 1 Cor. ii.
   14; Rom. viii. 7; -- or, Fourthly, That place it in the flesh, or old
   man, Rom. vi. 6; Gal. v. 16. So that it is not a bare imputation of
   another's fault, but an intrinsical adjacent corruption of our nature
   itself, that we call by this name of original sin. But, alas! it seems
   we are too large carvers for ourselves, in that wherewith we will not
   he contented.

   The Arminians deny all such imputation, as too heavy a charge for the
   pure, unblamable condition wherein they are brought into this world.
   They deny, I say, that they are guilty of Adam's sin, as sinning in
   him, or that his sin is any way imputed unto us; which is their second
   assault upon the truth of this article of faith.

   [126] "Adam sinned in his own proper person, and there is no reason why
   God should impute that sin of his unto infants," saith Boræus. The
   nature of the first covenant, the right and power of God, the
   comparison instituted by the apostle between Adam and Christ, the
   divine constitution, whereby Adam was appointed to be the head,
   fountain, and origin of all human kind, are with him no reasons at all
   to persuade it. [127] "For it is against equity," saith their Apology,
   "that one should be accounted guilty for a sin that is not his own, --
   that he should be reputed nocent who, in regard of his own will, is
   truly innocent." And here, Christian reader, behold plain Pelagianism
   obtruded on us without either welt [128] or guard; men on a sudden made
   pure and truly innocent, notwithstanding all that natural pollution and
   corruption the Scripture everywhere proclaims them to be replenished
   withal. Neither is the reason they intimate of any value, that their
   wills assented not to it, and which a little before they plainly urge.
   "It is," say they, [129] "against the nature of sin that that should be
   counted a sin to any by whose own proper will it was not committed:"
   which being all they have to say, they repeat it over and over in this
   case, -- "It must be voluntary, or it is no sin." But I say this is of
   no force at all; for, -- first, St John, in his most exact definition
   of sin, requires not voluntariness to the nature of it, but only an
   obliquity, a deviation from the rule. It is an anomy, -- a discrepancy
   from the law, which whether voluntary or no it skills not much; but
   sure enough there is in our nature such a repugnancy to the law of God.
   So that, secondly, if originally we are free from a voluntary actual
   transgression, yet we are not from an habitual voluntary digression and
   exorbitancy from the law. But, thirdly, in respect of our wills, we are
   not thus innocent neither; for we all sinned in Adam, as the apostle
   affirmeth. Now, all sin is voluntary, say the Remonstrants, and
   therefore Adam's transgression was our voluntary sin also, and that in
   divers respects, -- first, in that his voluntary act is imputed to us
   as ours, by reason of the covenant which was made with him on our
   behalf. But because this, consisting in an imputation, must needs be
   extrinsical unto us, therefore, secondly, we say that Adam, being the
   root and head of all human kind, and we all branches from that root,
   all parts of that body whereof he was the head, his will may be said to
   be ours. We were then all that one man, [130] -- we were all in him,
   and had no other will but his; so that though that be extrinsical unto
   us, considered as particular persons, yet it is intrinsical, as we are
   all parts of one common nature. As in him we sinned, so in him we had a
   will of sinning. Thirdly, original sin is a defect of nature, and not
   of this or that particular person: [131] whereon Alvarez grounds this
   difference of actual and original sin, -- that the one is always
   committed by the proper will of the sinner; to the other is required
   only the will of our first parent, who was the head of human nature.
   Fourthly, It is hereditary, natural, and no way involuntary, or put
   into us against our wills. It possesseth our wills and inclines us to
   voluntary sins.

   I see no reason, then, why Corvinus should affirm, as he doth, [132]
   "That it is absurd, that by one man's disobedience many should be made
   actually disobedient," unless he did it purposely to contradict St
   Paul, teaching us that "by one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners," Rom. v. 19. Paulus ait, Corvinus negat; eligite cui credatis;
   -- Choose whom you will believe, St Paul or the Arminians. The sum of
   their endeavour in this particular is, to clear the nature of man from
   being any way guilty of Adam's actual sin, as being then in him a
   member and part of that body whereof he was the head, or from being
   obnoxious unto an imputation of it by reason of that covenant which God
   made with us all in him. So that, denying, as you saw before, all
   inherent corruption and pravity of nature, and now all participation,
   by any means, of Adam's transgression, methinks they cast a great
   aspersion on Almighty God, however he dealt with Adam for his own
   particular, yet for casting us, his most innocent posterity, out of
   paradise. It seems a hard case, that having no obliquity or sin in our
   nature to deserve it, nor no interest in his disobedience whose
   obedience had been the means of conveying so much happiness unto us, we
   should yet be involved in so great a punishment as we are; for that we
   are not now by birth under a great curse and punishment, they shall
   never be able to persuade any poor soul who ever heard of paradise, or
   the garden where God first placed Adam. And though all the rest, in
   their judgment, be no great matter, but an infirmity and languor of
   nature, or some such thing, yet, whatever it be, they confess it lights
   on us as well as him. [133] "We confess," say they, "that the sin of
   Adam may be thus far said to be imputed to his posterity, inasmuch as
   God would have them all born obnoxious to that punishment which Adam
   incurred by his sin, or permitted that evil which was inflicted on him
   to descend on them." Now, be this punishment what it will, never so
   small, yet if we have no demerit of our own, nor interest in Adam's
   sin, it is such an act of injustice as we must reject from the Most
   Holy, with a "God forbid." Far be it from the Judge of all the world to
   punish the righteous with the ungodly. If God should impute the sin of
   Adam unto us, and thereon pronounce us obnoxious to the curse deserved
   by it, -- if we have a pure, sinless, unspotted nature, -- even this
   could scarce be reconciled with that rule of his proceeding in justice
   with the sons of men, "The soul that sinneth it shall die;" which
   clearly granteth an impunity to all not tainted with sin. Sin and
   punishment, though they are sometimes separated by his mercy, pardoning
   the one and so not inflicting the other, yet never by his justice,
   inflicting the latter where the former is not. Sin imputed, by itself
   alone, without an inherent guilt, was never punished in any but Christ.
   The unsearchableness of God's love and justice, in laying the iniquity
   of us all upon him who had no sin, is an exception from that general
   rule he walketh by in his dealing with the posterity of Adam. So that
   if punishment be not due unto us for a solely imputed sin, much less,
   when it doth not stand with the justice and equity of God to impute any
   iniquity unto us at all, can we justly be wrapped in such a curse and
   punishment as woful experience teaches us that we lie under. Now, in
   this act of injustice, wherewith they charge the Almighty, the
   Arminians place the whole nature of original sin. [134] "We account
   not," say they, "original sin for a sin properly so called, that should
   make the posterity of Adam to deserve the wrath of God, nor for an evil
   that may properly be called a punishment, but only for an infirmity of
   nature;" which they interpret to be a kind of evil that, being
   inflicted on Adam, God suffereth to descend upon his posterity. So all
   the depravation of nature, the pollution, guilt, and concupiscence we
   derive from our first parents, the imputation of Adam's actual
   transgression, is all straitened to a small infirmity inflicted on poor
   innocent creatures.

   But let them enjoy their own wisdom, which is earthly, sensual, and
   devilish. The Scripture is clear that the sin of Adam is the sin of us
   all, not only by propagation and communication (whereby not his
   singular fault, but something of the same nature, is derived unto us),
   but also by an imputation of his actual transgression unto us all, his
   singular disobedience being by this means made ours. The grounds of
   this imputation I touched before, which may be all reduced to his being
   a common person and head of all our nature; which investeth us with a
   double interest in his demerits, whilst so he was:-- 1. As we were then
   in him and parts of him; 2. As he sustained the place of our whole
   nature in the covenant God made with him; -- both which, even according
   to the exigence of God's justice, require that his transgression be
   also accounted ours. And St Paul is plain, not only that "by one man's
   disobedience many were made sinners," Rom. v. 19, by the derivation of
   a corrupted nature, but also that "by one man's offense judgment came
   upon all," verse 18. Even for his one sin all of us are accounted to
   have deserved judgment and condemnation; and therefore, verse 12, he
   affirmeth that by one man sin and death entered upon all the world; and
   that because we have all sinned in him: which we no otherwise do but
   that his transgression in God's estimation is accounted ours. And the
   opposition the apostle there maketh between Christ and his
   righteousness, and Adam and his disobedience, doth sufficiently evince
   it; as may appear by this figure:-- [135]


   Sicut

   redundavit, eis

   The whole similitude chiefly consists in the imputation of Adam's sin
   and Christ's righteousness, unto the seed of the one by nature, and of
   the other by grace. But that we are counted righteous for the
   righteousness of Christ is, among Protestants (though some differ in
   the manner of their expressions), as yet without question; and,
   therefore, are no less undoubtedly accounted sinners by, or guilty of,
   the first sin of Adam.

   I shall not show their opposition unto the truth in many more
   particulars concerning this article of original sin, having been long
   ago most excellently prevented, even in this very method, by the way of
   antithesis to the Scripture and the orthodox doctrine of our church, by
   the famously learned Master Reynolds, in his excellent treatise, "Of
   the Sinfulness of Sin;" where he hath discovered their errors, fully
   answered their sophistical objections, and invincibly confirmed the
   truth from the word of God. Only, as I have showed already how they
   make this we call original sin no sin at all, neither inherent in us
   nor imputed unto us, nor no punishment truly so called; so, because our
   church saith directly that it meriteth damnation, I will briefly show
   what they conceive to be the desert thereof.

   First, For Adam himself, they affirm "that the death threatened unto
   him if he transgressed the covenant, and due unto him for it, [136] was
   neither death temporal, for that before he was subject unto, by the
   primary constitution of his nature; nor yet such an eternal death as is
   accompanied with damnation or everlasting punishment." Nor why, then,
   let us here learn some new divinity. Christians have hitherto believed
   that whatsoever may be comprised under the name of death, together with
   its antecedents, consequents, and attendants, was threatened to Adam in
   this commination; and divines, until this day, can find but these two
   sorts of death in the Scripture, as penal unto men, and properly so
   called; and shall we now be persuaded that it was neither of these that
   was threatened unto Adam. It must be so, if we will believe the
   Arminians; it was neither the one nor the other of the former; but
   whereas he was created mortal, and subject to a temporal death, the
   sanction of his obedience was a threatening of the utter dissolution of
   his soul and body, or a reduction to their primitive nothing. But what
   if a man will not here take them at their words, but believe, according
   to St Paul, That death entered by sin; that if we had never sinned, we
   had never died; that man, in the state of innocency, was, by God's
   constitution, free even from temporal death, and all things directly
   conducing thereunto? secondly, That this death, threatened to our first
   parents, comprehended damnation also of soul and body for evermore, and
   that of their imaginary dissolution there is not the least intimation
   in the word of God? -- why, I confess they have impudence enough, in
   divers places, to beg that we would believe their assertions, but never
   confidence enough to venture once to prove them true. Now, they who
   make so slight of the desert of this sin in Adam himself will surely
   scarce allow it to have any ill merit at all in his posterity.

   [137] "Whether ever any one were damned for original sin, and adjudged
   to everlasting torments, is deservedly doubted of. Yea, we doubt not to
   affirm that never any was so damned," saith Corvinus. And that this is
   not his sole opinion he declares by telling you no less of his master,
   Arminius [138] "It is most true," saith he, "that Arminius teacheth
   that it is perversely said that original sin makes a man guilty of
   death." Of any death, it should seem, temporal, eternal, or that
   annihilation they dream of. And he said true enough. Arminius doth
   affirm it, adding this reason, [139] "Because it is only the punishment
   of Adam's actual sin." Now, what kind of punishment they make this to
   be I showed you before. But truly I wonder, seeing they are everywhere
   so peremptory that the same thing cannot be a sin and a punishment, why
   they do so often nickname this "infirmity of nature," and call it a
   sin; which they suppose to be as far different from it as fire from
   water. Is it because they are unwilling, by new naming it, to
   contradict St Paul in express terms, never proposing it under any other
   denomination, or, if they can get a sophistical elusion for him, is it
   lest, by so doing, Christians should the more plainly discern their
   heresy? Or whatever other cause it be, in this I am sure they
   contradict themselves, notwithstanding in this they agree full well,
   [140] "That God rejecteth none for original sin only," as Episcopius
   speaks. And here, if you tell them that the question is not "de facto,"
   what God doth, but "de jure," what such sinners deserve, they tell us
   plainly, [141] "That God will not destinate any infants to eternal
   punishment for original sin, without their own proper actual sins;
   neither can he do so by right or in justice." So that the children of
   Turks, Pagans, and the like infidels, strangers from the covenant of
   grace, departing in their infancy, are far happier than any Christian
   men, who must undergo a hard warfare against sin and Satan, in danger
   to fall finally away at the last hour, and through many difficulties
   entering the kingdom of heaven, when they, without farther trouble, are
   presently assumed thither for their innocency; yea, although they are
   neither elected of God (for, as they affirm, he chooseth none but for
   their faith, which they have not); nor redeemed by Christ (for he died
   only for sinners, "he saveth his people from their sins," which they
   are not guilty of); nor sanctified by the Holy Ghost, all whose
   operations they restrain to a moral suasion, whereof infants are not a
   capable subject; -- which is not much to the honour of the blessed
   Trinity, that heaven should be replenished with them whom the Father
   never elected, the Son never redeemed, nor the Holy Ghost sanctified.

   And thus you see what they make of this original pravity of our nature,
   at most an infirmity or languor thereof, -- neither a sin, nor the
   punishment of sin properly so called, nor yet a thing that deserves
   punishment as a sin; which last assertion, whether it be agreeable to
   holy Scripture or no, these three following observations will
   declare:--

   First, There is no confusion, no disorder, no vanity in the whole
   world, in any of God's creatures, that is not a punishment of our sin
   in Adam. That great and almost universal ruin of nature, proceeding
   from the curse of God overgrowing the earth, and the wrath of God
   revealing itself from heaven, is the proper issue of his transgression.
   It was of the great mercy of God that the whole frame of nature was not
   presently rolled up in darkness, and reduced to its primitive
   confusion. Had we ourselves been deprived of those remaining sparks of
   God's image in our souls, which vindicate us from the number of the
   beasts that perish, -- had we been all born fools and void of reason,
   -- by dealing so with some in particular, he showeth us it had been but
   justice to have wrapped us in the same misery, all in general. All
   things, when God first created them, were exceeding good, and thought
   so by the wisdom of God himself; but our sin even compelled that good
   and wise Creator to hate and curse the work of his own hands. "Cursed
   is the ground," saith he to Adam, "for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou
   eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it
   bring forth to thee," Gen. iii. 17, 18. Hence was that heavy burden of
   "vanity," that "bondage of corruption," under which to this day "the
   whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain" until it be delivered,
   Rom. viii. 20-22. Now, if our sin had such a strange malignant
   influence upon those things which have no relation unto us but only as
   they were created for our use, surely it is of the great mercy of God
   that we ourselves are not quite confounded; which doth not yet so
   interpose itself, but that we are all compassed with divers sad effects
   of this iniquity, lying actually under divers pressing miseries, and
   deservedly obnoxious to everlasting destruction. So that, --

   Secondly, Death temporal, with all its antecedents and attendants, --
   all infirmities, miseries, sicknesses, wasting destroying passions,
   casualties that are penal, all evil conducing thereunto or waiting on
   it, -- a punishment of original sin; and this not only because the
   first actual sin of Adam is imputed to us, but most of them are the
   proper issues of that native corruption and pollution of sin which is
   stirring and operative within us for the production of such sad
   effects, our whole nature being by it thoroughly defiled. Hence are all
   the distortures and distemperatures of the soul by lusts,
   concupiscence, passions, blindness of mind, perverseness of will,
   inordinateness of affections, wherewith we are pressed and turmoiled,
   even proper issues of that inherent sin which possesseth our whole
   souls.

   Upon the body, also, it hath such an influence, in disposing it to
   corruption and mortality, as it is the original of all those
   infirmities, sicknesses, and diseases, which make us nothing but a shop
   of such miseries for death itself. As these and the like degrees are
   the steps which lead us on apace in the road that tends unto it, so
   they are the direct, internal, efficient causes thereof, in
   subordination to the justice of Almighty God, by such means inflicting
   it as a punishment of our sins in Adam. Man before his fall, though not
   in regard of the matter whereof he was made, nor yet merely in respect
   of his quickening form, yet in regard of God's ordination, was
   immortal, a keeper of his own everlastingness. Death, to which before
   he was not obnoxious, was threatened as a punishment of his sin: "In
   the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;" the exposition of
   which words, given by God at the time of his inflicting this
   punishment, and pronouncing man subject to mortality, clearly showeth
   that it comprehended temporal death also: "Dust thou art, and unto dust
   shalt thou return." Our return to dust is nothing but the soul leaving
   the body, whereby before it was preserved from corruption. Farther, St
   Paul opposeth that death we had by the sin of Adam to the resurrection
   of the body by the power of Christ: "For since by man came death, by
   man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
   even so in Christ shall all be made alive," 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22. The life
   which all shall receive by the power of Christ at the last day is
   essentially a reunion of soul and body; and therefore their separation
   is a thing we incurred by the sin of Adam. The same apostle also, Rom.
   v., describeth a universal reign of death over all, by reason of the
   first transgression. Even diseases, also, in the Scripture, are
   attributed unto sin, as their meritorious cause, John v. 14; 1 Cor. xi.
   30; Rev. ii. 22. And, in respect of all these, the mercy of God doth
   not so interpose itself but that all the sons of men are in some sort
   partakers of them.

   Thirdly, The final desert of original sin, as our article speaketh, is
   damnation, -- the wrath of God, to be poured on us in eternal torments
   of body and soul. To this end, also, many previous judgments of God are
   subservient, -- as the privation of original righteousness (which he
   took and withheld upon Adam's throwing it away), spiritual desertion,
   permission of sin, with all other destroying depravations of our
   nature, as far as they are merely penal; some of which are immediate
   consequents of Adam's singular actual transgression, as privation of
   original righteousness; others, as damnation itself, the proper effects
   of that derived sin and pollution that is in us. There is none damned
   but for his own sin. When divines affirm that by Adam's sin we are
   guilty of damnation, they do not mean that any are actually damned for
   this particular fact; but that by his sin, and our sinning in him, by
   God's most just ordination, we have contracted that exceeding pravity
   and sinfulness of nature which deserveth the curse of God and eternal
   damnation. It must be an inherent uncleanness that actually excludes
   out of the kingdom of heaven, Rev. xxi. 27; which uncleanness the
   apostle shows to be in infants not sanctified by an interest in the
   covenant. In brief, we are baptized unto the "remission of sins," that
   we may be saved, Acts ii. 38. That, then, which is taken away by
   baptism is that which hinders our salvation; which is not the first sin
   of Adam imputed, but our own inherent lust and pollution. We cannot be
   washed, and cleansed, and purged from an imputed sin; which is done by
   the laver of regeneration. From that which lies upon us only by an
   external denomination, we have no need of cleansing; we may be said to
   be freed from it, or justified, but not purged. The soul, then, that is
   guilty of sin shall die, and that for its own guilt. If God should
   condemn us for original sin only, it were not by reason of the
   imputation of Adam's fault, but of the iniquity of that portion of
   nature in which we are proprietaries.

   Now here, to shut up all, observe, that in this inquiry of the desert
   of original sin, the question is not, What shall be the certain lot of
   those that depart this life under the guilt of this sin only? but, What
   this hereditary and native corruption doth deserve in all those in whom
   it is? for, as St Paul saith, "We judge not them that are without"
   (especially infants), 1 Cor. v. 13. But for the demerit of it in the
   justice of God, our Saviour expressly affirmeth, that "except a man be
   born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God," John iii. 3, 5;
   and let them that can, distinguish between a not going to heaven and a
   going to hell: a third receptacle of souls in the Scripture we find
   not. St Paul also tells us that "by nature we are the children of
   wrath," Eph. ii. 3. Even originally and actually we are guilty of and
   obnoxious unto that wrath, which is accompanied with fiery indignation,
   that shall consume the adversaries. Again, we are assured that no
   unclean thing shall enter into heaven, Rev. xxi. 27; with which
   hell-deserving uncleanness children are polluted: and, therefore,
   unless it be purged with the blood of Christ, they have no interest in
   everlasting happiness. By this means sin is come upon all to
   condemnation; and yet do we not peremptorily censure to hell all
   infants departing this world without the laver of regeneration, -- the
   ordinary means of waiving the punishment due to this pollution. That is
   the question "de facto," which we before rejected. Yea, and two ways
   there are whereby God saveth such infants, snatching them like brands
   out of the fire:--

   First, By interesting them in the covenant, if their immediate or
   remote parents have been believers. He is a God of them and of their
   seed, extending his mercy unto a thousand generations of them that fear
   him.

   Secondly, By his grace of election, which is most free, and not tied to
   any conditions; by which I make no doubt but God taketh many unto him
   in Christ whose parents never knew, or had been despisers of, the
   gospel. And this is the doctrine of our church, agreeable to the
   Scripture, affirming the desert of original sin to be God's wrath and
   damnation. To both which how opposite is the Arminian doctrine may thus
   appear:--

                                 Chapter VIII.

   Of the state of Adam before the fall, or of original righteousness.

   In the last chapter we discovered the Arminian attempt of re-advancing
   the corrupted nature of man into that state of innocency and holiness
   wherein it was at first by God created; in which design, because they
   cannot but discern that the success is not answerable to their desires,
   and not being able to deny but that for so much good as we want (having
   cast it away), or evil of sin that we are subject unto more than we
   were at our first creation, we must be responsible to the justice of
   God, they labour to draw down our first parents, even from the instant
   of their forming, into the same condition wherein we are engaged by
   reason of corrupted nature. But, truly, I fear they will scarce obtain
   so prosperous an issue of their endeavour as Mohammed had when he
   promised the people he would call a mountain unto him; which miracle
   when they assembled to behold, but the mountain would not stir for all
   his calling, he replied, "If the mountain will not come to Mohammed,
   Mohammed will go to the mountain," and away he packed towards it. For
   we shall find that our Arminians can neither themselves climb the high
   mountain of innocency, nor yet call it down into the valley of sin and
   corruption wherein they are lodged. We have seen already how vain and
   frustrate was their former attempt: let us now take a view of their
   aspiring insolence, in making the pure creatures of God, holy and
   undefiled with any sin, to be invested with the same wretchedness and
   perverseness of nature with ourselves.

   It is not my intention to enter into any curious discourse concerning
   the state and grace of Adam before his fall, but only to give a
   faithful assent to what God himself affirmed of all the works of his
   hands, -- they were exceeding good. No evil, no deformity, or anything
   tending thereunto, did immediately issue from that Fountain of goodness
   and wisdom; and therefore, doubtless, man, the most excellent work of
   his hands, the greatest glory of his Creator, was then without spot or
   blemish, endued with all those perfections his nature and state of
   obedience was capable of. And careful we must be of casting any
   aspersions of defect on him that we will not with equal boldness
   ascribe to the image of God.

   Nothing doth more manifest the deviation of our nature from its first
   institution, and declare the corruption wherewith we are polluted, than
   that propensity which is in us to every thing that is evil; that
   inclination of the flesh which lusteth always against the Spirit; that
   lust and concupiscence which fomenteth, conceiveth, hatcheth, bringeth
   forth, and nourisheth sin; that perpetual proneness that is in
   unregenerate nature to every thing that is contrary to the pure and
   holy law of God. Now, because neither Scripture nor experience will
   suffer Christians quite to deny this pravity of our nature, this
   averseness from all good and propensity to sin, the Arminians extenuate
   as much as they are able, affirming that it is no great matter, no more
   than Adam was subject unto in the state of innocency. But, what! did
   God create in Adam a proneness unto evil? was that a part of his
   glorious image in whose likeness he was framed? Yea, saith Corvinus,
   [142] "By reason of his creation, man had an affection to what was
   forbidden by the law." But yet this seems injustice, that [143] "God
   should give a man a law to keep, and put upon his nature a repugnancy
   to that law;" as one of them affirmed at the synod of Dort. "No," saith
   the former author; [144] "man had not been fit to have had a law given
   unto him, had he not been endued with a propension and natural
   inclination to that which is forbidden by the law." But why is this so
   necessary in men rather than angels? No doubt there was a law, a rule
   for their obedience, given unto them at their first creation, which
   some transgressed, when others kept it inviolate. Had they also a
   propensity to sin concreated with their nature? had they a natural
   affection put upon them by God to that which was forbidden by the law?
   Let them only who will be wise beyond the word of God affix such
   injustice on the righteous Judge of all the earth. But so it seems it
   must be. [145] "There was an inclination in man to sin before the fall,
   though not altogether so vehement and inordinate as it is now," saith
   Arminius. Hitherto we have thought that the original righteousness
   wherein Adam was created had comprehended the integrity and perfection
   of the whole man; not only that whereby the body was obedient unto the
   soul, and all the affections subservient to the rule of reason for the
   performance of all natural actions, but also a light, uprightness, and
   holiness of grace in the mind and will, whereby he was enabled to yield
   obedience unto God for the attaining of that supernatural end whereunto
   he was created. No; but [146] "original righteousness," say our new
   doctors, "was nothing but a bridle to help to keep man's inordinate
   concupiscence within bounds:" so that the faculties of our souls were
   never endued with any proper innate holiness of their own. [147] "In
   the spiritual death of sin there are no spiritual gifts properly
   wanting in the will, because they were never there," say the six
   collocutors at the Hague.

   The sum is, man was created with a nature not only weak and imperfect,
   unable by its native strength and endowments to attain that
   supernatural end for which he was made, and which he was commanded to
   seek, but depraved also with a love and desire of things repugnant to
   the will of God, by reason of an inbred inclination to sinning. It doth
   not properly belong to this place to show how they extenuate those
   gifts also with which they cannot deny but that he was endued, and also
   deny those which he had, as a power to believe in Christ, or to assent
   unto any truth that God should reveal unto him; and yet they grant this
   privilege to every one of his posterity, in that depraved condition of
   nature whereinto by sin he cast himself and us. We have all now a power
   of believing in Christ; that is, Adam, by his fall, obtained a
   supernatural endowment far more excellent than any he had before. And
   let them not here pretend the universality of the new covenant until
   they can prove it; and I am certain it will be long enough. But this, I
   say, belongs not to this place; only, let us see how, from the word of
   God, we may overthrow the former odious heresy:--

   God in the beginning "created man in his own image," Gen. i. 27, --
   that is, "upright," Eccles. vii. 29, endued with a nature composed to
   obedience and holiness. That habitual grace and original righteousness
   wherewith he was invested was in a manner due unto him for the
   obtaining of that supernatural end whereunto he was created. A
   universal rectitude of all the faculties of his soul, advanced by
   supernatural graces, enabling him to the performance of those duties
   whereunto they were required, is that which we call the innocency of
   our first parents. Our nature was then inclined to good only, and
   adorned with all those qualifications that were necessary to make it
   acceptable unto God, and able to do what was required of us by the law,
   under the condition of everlasting happiness. Nature and grace, or
   original righteousness, before the fall, ought not to be so
   distinguished as if the one were a thing prone to evil, resisted and
   quelled by the other; for both complied, in a sweet union and harmony,
   to carry us along in the way of obedience to eternal blessedness.
   [There was] no contention between the flesh and the Spirit; but as all
   other things at theirs, so the whole man jointly aimed at his own
   chiefest good, having all means of attaining it in his power. That
   there was then no inclination to sin, no concupiscence of that which is
   evil, no repugnancy to the law of God, in the pure nature of man, is
   proved, because, --

   First, The Scripture, describing the condition of our nature at the
   first creation thereof, intimates no such propensity to evil, but
   rather a holy perfection, quite excluding it. We were created "in the
   image of God," Gen. i. 27, -- in such a perfect uprightness as is
   opposite to all evil inventions, Eccles. vii. 29; to which image when
   we are again in some measure "renewed" by the grace of Christ, Col.
   iii. 10, we see by the first-fruits that it consisted in "righteousness
   and true holiness," -- in truth and perfect holiness, Eph. iv. 24.

   Secondly, An inclination to evil, and a lusting after that which is
   forbidden, is that inordinate concupiscence wherewith our nature is now
   infected; which is everywhere in the Scripture condemned as a sin; St
   Paul, in the seventh to the Romans, affirming expressly that it is a
   sin, and forbidden by the law, verse 7, producing all manner of evil,
   and hindering all that is good, -- a "body of death," verse 24; and St
   James maketh it even the womb of all iniquity, James i. 14, 15. Surely
   our nature was not at first yoked with such a troublesome inmate. Where
   is the uprightness and innocency we have hitherto conceived our first
   parents to have enjoyed before the fall? A repugnancy to the law must
   needs be a thing sinful. An inclination to evil, to a thing forbidden,
   is an anomy, -- a deviation and discrepancy from the pure and holy law
   of God. We must speak no more, then, of the state of innocency, but
   only of a short space wherein no outward actual sins were committed.
   Their proper root, if this be true, was concreated with our nature. Is
   this that obediential harmony to all the commandments of God which is
   necessary for a pure and innocent creature, that hath a law prescribed
   unto him? By which of the ten precepts is this inclination to evil
   required? Is it by the last, "Thou shalt not covet?" or by that sum of
   them all, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart," etc.?
   Is this all the happiness of paradise, -- to be turmoiled with a nature
   swelling with abundance of vain desires, and with a main stream carried
   headlong to all iniquity, if its violent appetite be not powerfully
   kept in by the bit and bridle of original righteousness? So it is we
   see with children now; [148] and so it should have been with them in
   paradise, if they were subject to this rebellious inclination to sin.

   Thirdly, and principally, Whence had our primitive nature this
   affection to those things that were forbidden it, -- this rebellion and
   repugnancy to the law, which must needs be an anomy, and so a thing
   sinful? There was as yet no demerit, to deserve it as a punishment.
   What fault is it to be created? [149] The operation of any thing which
   hath its original with the being of the thing itself must needs proceed
   from the same cause as doth the essence or being itself; as the fire's
   tending upwards relates to the same original with the fire: and,
   therefore, this inclination or affection can have no other author but
   God; by which means he is entitled not only to the first sin, as the
   efficient cause, but to all the sins in the world arising from thence.
   Plainly, and without any strained consequences, he is made the author
   of sin; for even those positive properties which can have no other
   fountain but the author of nature, being set on evil, are directly
   sinful. And here the idol of free-will may triumph in this victory over
   the God of heaven. Heretofore all the blame of sin lay upon his
   shoulders, but now he begins to complain, Ouk ego aitios eimi alla Zeus
   kai moira. "It is God and the fate of our creation that hath placed us
   in this condition of naturally affecting that which is evil. Back with
   all your charges against the ill government of this new deity within
   his imaginary dominion; what hurt doth he do but incline men unto evil,
   and God himself did no less at the first?" But let them that will,
   rejoice in these blasphemies: it sufficeth us to know that "God created
   man upright," though he "hath sought out many inventions;" so that in
   this following dissonancy we cleave to the better part:--

                                  Chapter IX.

   Of the death of Christ, and of the efficacy of his merits.

   The sum of those controversies, wherewith the Arminians and their
   abettors have troubled the church, about the death of Christ, may be
   reduced to two heads:-- First, Concerning the object of his merit, or
   whom he died for; secondly, Concerning the efficacy and end of his
   death, or what he deserved, procured, merited, and obtained, for them
   for whom he died. In resolution of the first, they affirm that he died
   for all and every one; of the second, that he died for no one man at
   all in that sense Christians have hitherto believed that he laid down
   his life, and submitted himself to bear the burden of his Father's
   wrath for their sakes. It seems to me a strange extenuation of the
   merit of Christ, to teach that no good at all by his death doth redound
   to divers of them for whom he died. What participation in the benefit
   of his suffering had Pharaoh or Judas? Do they not at this hour, and
   shall they not to eternity, feel the weight and burden of their own
   sins? Had they either grace in this world, or glory in the other, that
   they should be said to have an interest in the death of our Saviour?
   Christians have hitherto believed, that for whom Christ died, for their
   sins he made satisfaction, that they themselves should not eternally
   suffer for them. Is God unjust to punish twice for the same fault? his
   own Son once, and again the poor sinners for whom he suffered? I cannot
   conceive an intention in God that Christ should satisfy his justice for
   the sin of them that were in hell some thousands of years before, and
   yet be still resolved to continue their punishment on them to all
   eternity. No, doubtless: Christ giveth life to every one for whom he
   gave his life; he loseth not one of them whom he purchased with his
   blood.

   The first part of this controversy may be handled under these two
   questions:-- First, Whether God giving his Son, and Christ making his
   soul a ransom for sin, intended thereby to redeem all and every one
   from their sins, that all and every one alike, from the beginning of
   the world to the last day, should all equally be partakers of the
   fruits of his death and passion; which purpose of theirs is in the most
   frustrate? Secondly, Whether God had not a certain infallible intention
   of gathering unto himself a "chosen people," of collecting a "church of
   first-born," of saving his "little flock," of bringing some certainly
   to happiness, by the death of his only Son; which in the event he doth
   accomplish?

   The second part also may be reduced to these two heads:-- First,
   Whether Christ did not make full satisfaction for all their sins for
   whom he died, and merited glory, or everlasting happiness, to be
   bestowed on them upon the performance of those conditions God should
   require? Secondly (which is the proper controversy I shall chiefly
   insist upon), Whether Christ did not procure for his own people a power
   to become the sons of God, merit and deserve at the hands of God for
   them, grace, faith, righteousness, and sanctification, whereby they may
   be enabled infallibly to perform the conditions of the new covenant,
   upon the which they shall be admitted to glory?

   To the first question of the first part of the controversy, the
   Arminians answer affirmatively, -- to wit, that Christ died for all
   alike; the benefit of his passion belongs equally to all the posterity
   of Adam. And to the second negatively, -- that God had no such
   intention of bringing many chosen sons unto salvation by the death of
   Christ, but determined of grace and glory no more precisely to one than
   to another, to John than Judas, Abraham than Pharaoh? Both which, as
   the learned Moulin observed, [150] seemed to be invented to make
   Christianity ridiculous, and expose our religion to the derision of all
   knowing men: for who can possibly conceive that one by the appointment
   of God should die for another, and yet that other, by the same justice,
   be allotted unto death himself, when one's death only was due; that
   Christ hath made a full satisfaction for their sins who shall
   everlastingly feel the weight of them themselves; that he should merit
   and obtain reconciliation with God for them who live and die his
   enemies, grace and glory for them who are graceless in this life and
   damned in that which is to come; that he should get remission of sins
   for them whose sins were never pardoned? In brief, if this sentence be
   true, either Christ by his death did not reconcile us unto God, make
   satisfaction to his justice for our iniquities, redeem us from our
   sins, purchase a kingdom, an everlasting inheritance for us, -- which I
   hope no Christian will say; or else all the former absurdities must
   necessarily follow, -- which no rational man will ever admit.

   Neither may we be charged as straiteners of the merit of Christ; for we
   advance the true value and worth thereof (as hereafter will appear) far
   beyond all the Arminians ascribe unto it. We confess that that "blood
   of God," Acts xx. 28, of the "Lamb without blemish and without spot," 1
   Pet. i. 19, was so exceedingly precious, of that infinite worth and
   value, that it might have saved a thousand believing worlds, John iii.
   16; Rom. iii. 22. His death was of sufficient dignity to have been made
   a ransom for all the sins of every one in the world. And on this
   internal sufficiency of his death and passion is grounded the
   universality of evangelical promises; which have no such restriction in
   their own nature as that they should not be made to all and every one,
   though the promulgation and knowledge of them are tied only to the good
   pleasure of God's special providence, Matt. xvi. 17; as also that
   economy and dispensation of the new covenant whereby, the
   partition-wall being broken down, there remains no more difference
   between Jew and Gentile, the utmost borders of the earth being given in
   for Christ's inheritance. So that, in some sense, Christ may be said to
   die for "all," and "the whole world;" -- first, Inasmuch as the worth
   and value of his death was very sufficient to have been made a price
   for all their sins; secondly, Inasmuch as this word "all" is taken for
   some of all sorts (not for every one of every sort), as it is
   frequently used in the holy Scripture: so Christ being lifted up, "drew
   all unto him," John xii. 32; that is, believers out of all sorts of
   men. The apostles cured all diseases, or some of all sorts: they did
   not cure every particular disease, but there was no kind of disease
   that was exempted from their power of healing. So that where it is said
   that Christ "died for all," it is meant either, -- first, All the
   faithful; or, secondly, Some of all sorts; thirdly, Not only Jews, but
   Gentiles. For, --

   Secondly, The proper counsel and intention of God in sending his Son
   into the world to die was, that thereby he might confirm and ratify the
   new covenant to his elect, and purchase for them all the good things
   which are contained in the tenure of that covenant, -- to wit, grace
   and glory; that by his death he might bring many (yet some certain)
   children to glory, obtaining for them that were given unto him by his
   Father (that is, his whole church) reconciliation with God, remission
   of sins, faith, righteousness, sanctification, and life eternal. That
   is the end to which they are to be brought, and the means whereby God
   will have them attain it. He died that he might gather the dispersed
   children of God, and make them partakers of everlasting glory, -- to
   "give eternal life to as many as God gave him," John xvii. 2. And on
   this purpose of himself and his Father is founded the intercession of
   Christ for his elect and chosen people; performed partly on the earth,
   John xvii., partly in heaven, before the throne of grace: which is
   nothing but a presentation of himself and his merits, accompanied with
   the prayers of his mediatorship before God, that he would be pleased to
   grant and effectually to apply the good things he hath by them obtained
   to all for whom he hath obtained them. His intercession in heaven is
   nothing but a continued oblation of himself. So that whatsoever Christ
   impetrated, merited, or obtained by his death and passion, must be
   infallibly applied unto and bestowed upon them for whom he intended to
   obtain it; or else his intercession is vain, he is not heard in the
   prayers of his mediatorship. An actual reconciliation with God, and
   communication of grace and glory, must needs betide all them that have
   any such interest in the righteousness of Christ as to have it accepted
   for their good. The sole end why Christ would so dearly purchase those
   good things is, an actual application of them unto his chosen: God set
   forth the propitiation of his blood for the remission of sins, that he
   might be the justifier of him which believeth on Jesus, Rom. iii. 25,
   26. But this part of the controversy is not that which I principally
   intend; only, I will give you a brief sum of those reasons which
   overthrow their heresy in this particular branch thereof:--

   First, The death of Christ is in divers places of the Scripture
   restrained to his "people," and "elect," his "church," and "sheep,"
   Matt. i. 21; John x. 11-13; Acts xx. 28; Eph. v. 25; John xi. 51, 52;
   Rom. viii. 32, 34; Heb. ii. 9, 14; Rev. v. 9; Dan. ix. 26; -- and
   therefore the good purchased thereby ought not to be extended to
   "dogs," "reprobates," and "those that are without."

   Secondly, For whom Christ died, he died as their sponsor, in their room
   and turn, that he might free them from the guilt and desert of death;
   which is clearly expressed Rom. v. 6-8. "He was wounded for our
   transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
   our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed," Isa. liii.
   5, 6, etc. "He hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
   curse for us," Gal. iii. 13. "He hath made him to be sin for us, who
   knew no sin," 2 Cor. v. 21. Evidently he changeth turns with us, "that
   we might be made the righteousness of God in him." Yea, in other
   things, it is plain in the Scripture that to die for another is to take
   his place and room, with an intention that he should live, 2 Sam.
   xviii. 33; Rom. v. So that Christ dying for men made satisfaction for
   their sins, that they should not die. Now, for what sins he made
   satisfaction, for them the justice of God is satisfied; which surely is
   not done for the sins of the reprobates, because he justly punisheth
   them to eternity upon themselves, Matt. v. 26.

   Thirdly, For whom Christ "died," for them also he "rose again," to make
   intercession for them: for whose "offenses he was delivered," for their
   "justification he was raised," Rom. iv. 25, v. 10. He is a high priest
   "to make intercession for them" in the holy of holies for whom "by his
   own blood he obtained eternal redemption," Heb. ix. 11, 12. These two
   acts of his priesthood are not to be separated; it belongs to the same
   mediator for sin to sacrifice and pray. Our assurance that he is our
   advocate is grounded on his being a propitiation for our sins. He is an
   "advocate" for every one for whose sins his blood was a "propitiation,"
   1 John ii. 1, 2. But Christ doth not intercede and pray for all, as
   himself often witnesseth, John xvii.; he "maketh intercession" only for
   them who "come unto God by him," Heb. vii. 25. He is not a mediator of
   them that perish, no more than an advocate of them that fail in their
   suits; and therefore the benefit of his death also must be restrained
   to them who are finally partakers of both. We must not so disjoin the
   offices of Christ's mediatorship, that one of them may be versated
   about some towards whom he exerciseth not the other; much less ought we
   so to separate the several acts of the same office. For whom Christ is
   a priest, to offer himself a sacrifice for their sins, he is surely a
   king, to apply the good things purchased by his death unto them, as
   Arminius himself confesseth; much more to whom he is a priest by
   sacrifice, he will be a priest by intercession. And, therefore, seeing
   he doth not intercede and pray for every one, he did not die for every
   one.

   Fourthly, For whom Christ died he merited grace and glory, faith and
   salvation, and reconciliation with God; as I shall show hereafter. But
   this he hath not done for all and every one. Many do never believe; the
   wrath of God remaineth upon some; the wrath of God abideth on them that
   do not believe, John iii. 36. To abide argueth a continued,
   uninterrupted act. Now, to be reconciled to one, and yet to lie under
   his heavy anger, seem to me asustata, -- things that will scarce
   consist together. The reasons are many; I only point at the heads of
   some of them.

   Fifthly, Christ died for them whom God gave unto him to be saved:
   "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me," John xvii. 6. He layeth
   down his life for the sheep committed to his charge, chap. x. 11. But
   all are not the sheep of Christ, all are not given unto him of God to
   be brought to glory; for of those that are so given there is not one
   that perisheth, for "he giveth eternal life to as many as God hath
   given him," chap. xvii. 2. "No man is able to pluck them out of his
   Father's hand," chap. x. 28, 29.

   Sixthly, Look whom, and how many, that love of God embraced that was
   the cause of sending his Son to redeem them; for them, and so many, did
   Christ, according to the counsel of his Father, and in himself,
   intentionally lay down his life. Now, this love is not universal, being
   his "good pleasure" of blessing with spiritual blessings and saving
   some in Christ, Eph. i. 4, 5; which good pleasure of his evidently
   comprehendeth some, when others are excluded, Matt. xi. 25, 26. Yea,
   the love of God in giving Christ for us is of the same extent with that
   grace whereby he calleth us to faith, or bestoweth faith on us: for "he
   hath called us with an holy calling, according to his own purpose and
   grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus," 2 Tim. i. 9; which,
   doubtless, is not universal and common unto all.

   Innumerable other reasons there are to prove, that seeing God hath
   given his elect only, whom only he loved, to Christ to be redeemed; and
   seeing that the Son loveth only those who are given him of his Father,
   and redeemeth only whom he loveth; seeing, also, that the Holy Spirit,
   the love of the Father and the Son, sanctifieth all, and only them,
   that are elected and redeemed, -- it is not our part, with a
   preposterous liberality, against the witness of Christ himself, to
   assign the salvation attained by him as due to them that are without
   the congregation of them whom the Father hath loved and chosen, without
   that church which the Son loved and gave his life for, nor none of the
   members of that sanctified body whereof Christ is the Head and Saviour.
   I urge no more, because this is not that part of the controversy that I
   desire to lay open.

   I come now to consider the main question of this difference, though
   sparingly handled by our divines, concerning what our Saviour merited
   and purchased for them for whom he died. And here you shall find the
   old idol playing his pranks, and quite divesting the merit of Christ
   from the least ability or power of doing us any good; for though the
   Arminians pretend, very speciously, that Christ died for all men, yet,
   in effect, they make him die for no one man at all, and that by denying
   the effectual operation of his death, and ascribing the proper issues
   of his passion to the brave endeavours of their own Pelagian deity.

   We, according to the Scriptures, plainly believe that Christ hath, by
   his righteousness, merited for us grace and glory; that we are blessed
   with all spiritual blessings, in, through, and for him; that he is made
   unto us righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that he hath
   procured for us, and that God for his sake bestoweth on us, every grace
   in this life that maketh us differ from others, and all that glory we
   hope for in that which is to come; he procured for us remission of all
   our sins, an actual reconciliation with God, faith, and obedience. Yea,
   but this is such a desperate doctrine as stabs at the very heart of the
   idol, and would make him as altogether useless as if he were but a
   fig-tree log. What remaineth for him to do, if all things in this great
   work of our salvation must be thus ascribed unto Christ and the merit
   of his death? Wherefore the worshippers of this great god, Lib. Arbit.,
   oppose their engines against the whole fabric, and cry down the title
   of Christ's merits to these spiritual blessings, in the behalf of their
   imaginary deity.

   Now, because they are things of a twofold denomination about which we
   contend before the King of heaven, each part producing their evidence,
   the first springing from the favour of God towards us, the second from
   the working of his grace actually within us, I shall handle them
   severally and apart; -- especially because to things of this latter
   sort, gifts, as we call them, enabling us to fulfil the condition
   required for the attaining of glory, we lay a double claim on God's
   behalf; first, As the death of Christ is the meritorious cause
   procuring them of him; secondly, As his free grace is their efficient
   cause working them in us; -- they also producing a double title,
   whereby they would invest their beloved darling with a sole propriety
   in causing these effects; first, In regard that they are our own acts,
   performed in us and by us; secondly, As they are parts of our duty
   which we are enjoined to do. So that the quarrel is directly between
   Christ's merits and our own free-will about procuring the favour of
   God, and obtaining grace and righteousness. Let us see what they say to
   the first.

   They affirm that [151] "the immediate and proper effect or end of the
   death and passion of Christ is, not an actual ablation of sin from men,
   not an actual remission of iniquities, justification and redemption of
   any soul;" that is, Christ's death is not the meritorious cause of the
   remission of our sins, of redemption and justification. The meritorious
   cause, I say: for of some of them, as of justification, as it is
   terminated in us, we confess there are causes of other kinds, as faith
   is the instrument and the Holy Spirit the efficient thereof; but for
   the sole meritorious procuring cause of these spiritual blessings, we
   always took it to be the righteousness and death of Christ, believing
   plainly that the end why Christ died, and the fruit of his sufferings,
   was our reconciliation with God, redemption from our sins, freedom from
   the curse, deliverance from the wrath of God and power of hell, --
   though we be not actual partakers of these things, to the pacification
   of our own consciences, without the intervening operation of the Holy
   Spirit, and faith by him wrought in us.

   But if this be not, pray what is obtained by the death of Christ? Why,
   [152] "a potential, conditionate reconciliation, not actual and
   absolute," saith Corvinus. But yet this potential reconciliation being
   a new expression, never intimated in the Scripture, and scarce of
   itself intelligible, we want a farther explanation of their mind, to
   know what it is that directly they assign to the merits of Christ.
   Wherefore they tell us that the fruit of his death was [153] "such an
   impetration or obtaining of reconciliation with God, and redemption for
   us, that God thereby hath a power, his justice being satisfied, and so
   not compelling him to the contrary, to grant remission of sins to
   sinful men on what condition he would;" or, as another speaketh it,
   [154] "There was, by the effusion of Christ's blood, a right obtained
   unto and settled in God, of reconciling the world, and of opening unto
   all a gate of repentance and faith in Christ." But now, whereas the
   Scripture everywhere affirmeth that Christ died for our good, to obtain
   blessings for us, to purchase our peace, to acquire and merit for us
   the good things contained in the promise of the covenant, this opinion
   seems to restrain the end and fruit thereof to the obtaining of a power
   and liberty unto God of prescribing us a condition whereby we may be
   saved. But yet, it may be, thus much at least Christ obtained of God in
   our behalf, that he should assign faith in him to be this condition,
   and to bestow it upon us also. No; neither the one nor the other. [155]
   "After all this, had it so seemed good unto his wisdom, God might have
   chosen the Jews, and others, following the righteousness of the law, as
   well as believers; because he might have assigned any other condition
   of salvation besides faith in Christ," saith Grevinchovius.
   Notwithstanding, then, the death of Christ for us, we might have been
   held to the old rule, "Do this, and live." But if this be true, I
   cannot perceive how it may be said that Christ died to redeem us from
   our sins, to save our souls, and bring us unto glory. Neither, perhaps,
   do they think this to be any great inconvenience; for the same author
   affirmeth that [156] "Christ cannot be said properly to die to save any
   one." And a little after he more fully declares himself, that [157]
   "after Christ had obtained all that he did obtain by his death, the
   right remained wholly in God to apply it, or not to apply it, as it
   should seem good unto him; the application of grace and glory to any
   man was not the end for which Christ obtained them, but to get a right
   and power unto God of bestowing those things on what sort of men he
   would;" -- which argues no redemption of us from our sins, but a
   vindication of God from such a condition wherein he had not power to
   forgive them; not an obtaining of salvation for us, but of a liberty
   unto God of saving us on some condition or other.

   But now, after God hath got this power by the death of Christ, and out
   of his gracious good pleasure assigned faith to be the means for us to
   attain those blessings, he hath procured himself a liberty to bestow.
   Did Christ obtain this faith for us of him, if it be a thing not in our
   own power? No; [158] "faith is not obtained by the death of Christ,"
   saith Corvinus. So that there is no good thing, no spiritual blessing,
   into which any man in the world hath any interest by the death of
   Christ: which is not so great an absurdity but that they are most ready
   to grant it. Arnoldus confesseth, [159] "that he believes that the
   death of Christ might have enjoyed its end, or his merit its full
   force, although never any had believed:" and again, [160] "The death
   and satisfaction of Christ being accomplished, it might come to pass
   that, none fulfilling the condition of the new covenant, none should be
   saved." So also saith Grevinchovius. O Christ! that any pretending to
   profess thy holy name should thus slight the precious work of thy death
   and passion! Surely never any before, who counted it their glory to be
   called Christians, did ever thus extenuate (their friends the Socinians
   only excepted) the dignity of his merit and satisfaction. Take but a
   short view of what benefit they allow to redound to us by the effusion
   of his precious blood, and you may see what a pestilent heresy these
   men have laboured to bring into the church. Neither faith nor
   salvation, grace nor glory, hath he purchased for us, -- not any
   spiritual blessing, that by our interest in his death we can claim to
   be ours! It is not such a reconciliation with God as that he thereupon
   should be contented again to be called our God; it is not
   justification, nor righteousness, nor actual redemption from our sins;
   it did not make satisfaction for our iniquities, and deliver us from
   the curse; [161] "only it was a means of obtaining such a possibility
   of salvation, as that God, without wronging of his justice, might save
   us if he would, one way or other." So that, when Christ had done all
   that he could, there was not one man in the world immediately the
   better for it; notwithstanding the utmost of his endeavour, every one
   might have been damned with Judas to the pit of hell; for [162] "he
   died as well for Simon Magus and Judas as he did for Peter and Paul,"
   say the Arminians. Now, if no more good redound to us by the death of
   Christ than to Simon Magus, we are not much obliged to him for our
   salvation. Nay, he may be rather said to have redeemed God than us; for
   he procured for him immediately a power to redeem us if he would; for
   us only, by virtue of that power, a possibility to be redeemed; --
   which leaves nothing of the nature of merit annexed to his death, for
   that deserveth that something be done, not only that it may be done;
   the workman deserveth that his wages be given him, and not that it may
   be given him. And then what becomes of all the comfort and consolation
   that is proposed to us in the death of Christ? But it is time to see
   how this stubble is burned and consumed by the word of God, and that
   established which they thought to overthrow.

   First, It is clear that Christ died to procure for us an actual
   reconciliation with God, and not only a power for us to be reconciled
   unto him; for "when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son," Rom. v. 10. We enjoy an actual reconciliation unto
   God by his death. He is content to be called "our God" when we are
   enemies, without the intervening of any condition on our part required;
   though the sweetness, comfort, and knowledge of this reconciliation do
   not compass our souls before we believe in him. Again, we have
   remission of sins by his blood, and justification from them; not a sole
   vindication into such an estate wherein, if it please God and
   ourselves, our sins are pardonable: for we are "justified freely by his
   grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath
   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
   his righteousness for the remission of sins," Rom. iii. 24, 25. Yea, he
   obtained for us by his death righteousness and holiness. "He gave
   himself for the church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it," Eph. v.
   25, 26; "that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
   having spot or wrinkle;" that we should be "holy and without blemish,"
   verse 27. Where, first, we have whom Christ died or gave himself for,
   even his church; secondly, what he obtained for it, -- holiness and
   righteousness, a freedom from the spots and blemishes of sin, that is,
   the grace of justification and sanctity: "He made him to be sin for us,
   who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
   him," 2 Cor. v. 21. And, lastly, he died to purchase for us "an eternal
   inheritance," Heb. ix. 15. So that both grace and glory are bestowed on
   them for whom he died, as the immediate fruits of his death and
   passion.

   Secondly, See what the Scripture rhetos, "expressly," assigneth as the
   proper end and immediate effect (according to the purpose of God and
   his own intention) of the effusion of the blood of Jesus Christ, and
   you shall find that he intended by it to take away the sins of many; to
   "make his soul an offering for sin," that he might "see his seed," that
   "the pleasure of the Lord might prosper in his hand," Isa. liii. 10; to
   be "a ransom for many," Matt. xx. 28; to "bear the sins of many," Heb.
   ix. 28. He "bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we should
   live unto righteousness," 1 Pet. ii. 24; that "we might be made the
   righteousness of God in him," 2 Cor. v. 21; thereby reconciling us unto
   God, verse 19. He died to "reconcile us unto God, in the body of his
   flesh through death," that we might be "holy and unblamable," Col. i.
   21, 22; to "purge our sins," Heb. i. 3; to "obtain eternal redemption
   for us," chap. ix. 12. So that if Christ by his death obtained what he
   did intend, he hath purchased for us not only a possibility of
   salvation, but holiness, righteousness, reconciliation with God,
   justification freedom from the guilt and condemning power of sin,
   everlasting redemption, eternal life and glory in heaven.

   Thirdly, I appeal unto the conscience of all Christians, -- First,
   Whether they do not suppose the very foundation of all their
   consolation to be stricken at, when they shall find those places of
   Scripture [163] that affirm Christ to have died to take away our sins,
   to reconcile us unto God, to put away or abolish our transgressions, to
   wash and regenerate us, perfectly to save us, and purchase for us an
   everlasting redemption, whereby he is become unto us righteousness, and
   redemption, and sanctification, the Lord our righteousness, and we
   become the righteousness of God in him, to be so wrested as if he
   should be said only to have done something from which these things
   might happily follow?

   Secondly, Whether they think it not a ready way to impair their love
   and to weaken their faith in Christ, when they shall be taught that
   Christ hath done no more for them than for those that are damned in
   hell; that, be their assurance never so great that Christ died for
   them, yet there is enough to be laid to their charge to condemn them;
   that though God is said to have reconciled them unto himself in Christ,
   Col. i. 19, 20, yet indeed he is as angry with them as with any
   reprobate in the world; that God loveth us not first, but so long as we
   continue in a state of enmity against him, before our conversion, he
   continues our enemy also, so that the first act of friendship or love
   must be performed on our part, notwithstanding that the Scripture
   saith, "When we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God," Rom. v. 10?

   Thirdly, Whether they have not hitherto supposed themselves bound to
   believe that Christ died for their sins, and rose for their
   justification? Do they not think it lawful to pray that God would
   bestow upon them grace and glory for Christ's sake? and to believe that
   Jesus Christ was such a mediator of the new covenant as procured for
   the persons covenanted withal all the good things comprehended in the
   promise of that covenant?

   I will not farther press upon this prevarication against Christian
   religion; only, I would desire all the lovers of Jesus Christ seriously
   to consider whether these men do truly aim at his honour and advancing
   the dignity of his merit, and not rather at the crying up of their own
   endeavours, seeing the sole cause of their denying these glorious
   effects of the blood of Christ is to appropriate the praise of them
   unto themselves; as we shall see in the next chapter.

   These charges are never to be waived by the vanity of their sophistical
   distinctions, as of that of impetration and application; which, though
   it may be received in an orthodox meaning, yet not in that sense, or
   rather nonsense, whereunto they abuse it; -- namely, as though Christ
   had obtained that for some which shall never be imparted unto them;
   that all the blessings procured by his death are proper to none, but
   pendent in the air for them that can or will catch them: whereupon,
   when we object [164] that by this means all the efficacy of the merit
   of Christ is in our own power, they readily grant it, and say it cannot
   otherwise be. Let them that can, receive these monsters in
   Christianity; for my part, in these following contradictory assertions
   I will choose rather to adhere to the authority of the word of God than
   of Arminius and his sectaries:--

   S. S.

   "He made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
   the righteousness of God in him," 2 Cor. v. 21. "He loved the church,
   and gave himself for it; that he might present it unto himself a
   glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing," Eph.
   v. 25, 27.

   "The immediate effect of the death of Christ is not the remission of
   sins, or the actual redemption of any," Armin. "Christ did not properly
   die to save any one," Grevinch.

   "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself," 2 Cor. v. 19.

   "A potential and conditionate reconciliation, not actual and absolute,
   is obtained by the death of Christ," Corv.

   "When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his
   seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
   prosper in his hand," Isa. liii. 10.

   "I believe it might have come to pass that the death of Christ might
   have had its end, though never any man had believed," Corv.

   "By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
   bear their iniquities," Isa. liii. 11.

   "The death and satisfaction of Christ being accomplished, yet it may so
   come to pass that, none at all fulfilling the condition of the new
   covenant, none might be saved," Idem.

   "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," Heb. ix. 28. "By
   his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
   eternal redemption for us," chap. ix. 12. "He hath reconciled you in
   the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and
   unblamable, and unreprovable," Col. i. 21, 22.

   "The impetration of salvation for all, by the death of Christ, is
   nothing but the obtaining of a possibility thereof; that God, without
   wronging his justice, may open unto them a gate of mercy, to be entered
   on some condition," Rem. Coll. Hag.

   "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
   blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins," etc.:
   "that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
   Jesus," Rom. iii. 25, 26.

   "Notwithstanding the death of Christ, God might have assigned any other
   condition of salvation as well as faith, or have chosen the Jews
   following the righteousness of the law," Grevinch.

   "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
   being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes we
   were healed," 1 Pet. ii. 24.

   "Why, then, the efficacy of the death of Christ depends wholly on us."
   "True; it cannot otherwise be," Rem. Apol.

                                   Chapter X.

   Of the cause of faith, grace, and righteousness.

   The second part of this controversy is in particular concerning grace,
   faith, and holiness, sincere obedience to the precepts of the new
   covenant, all whose praise we appropriate to the Most High by reason of
   a double interest, -- first, Of the merit of Christ, which doth procure
   them for us; secondly, Of the Holy Spirit, which works them in us. The
   death of Christ is their meritorious cause; the Spirit of God and his
   effectual grace their efficient, working instrumentally with power by
   the word and ordinances. Now, because this would deprive the idol of
   his chiefest glory, and expose him to open shame, like the bird
   "furtivis nudata coloribus," the Arminians advance themselves in his
   quarrel, and in behalf of their darling quite exclude both merit of
   Christ and Spirit of God from any title to their production.

   First, For the merit of Christ. Whereas we affirm that God "blesseth us
   with all spiritual blessings in him," or for his sake, Eph. i. 3,
   amongst which, doubtless, faith possesseth not the lowest room; that
   "he is made unto us righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption;"
   that "he was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness
   of God in him;" that he is "the Lord our righteousness," and glories to
   be called by that name (and whatever he is unto us, it is chiefly by
   the way of merit); that "to us it is given huper Christou, for Christ's
   sake, to believe on him," Phil. i. 29, where huper Christou is plainly
   referred to didotai, [echaristhe,?] "is given," -- as if the apostle
   should have said, "Christ is the meritorious cause of the bestowing of
   those good gifts, faith and constancy unto martyrdom, upon you;" --
   when, I say, we profess all these to be the proper and immediate
   products of the passion and blood of Christ, these turbulent Davusses
   come in with a prohibition, and quite expel it from having any interest
   therein.

   [165] "There is nothing more vain, nothing more foolish," say they in
   their Apology, "than to attribute our regeneration and faith unto the
   death of Christ; for if Christ may be said to have merited for us faith
   and regeneration, then faith cannot be a condition whose performance
   God should require at the hands of sinners under the pain of eternal
   damnation." And again, [166] "If faith be the effect of the merit of
   Christ, it cannot be our duty." No? Suppose, then, that the church
   should pray that it would please God, for Christ's sake, to call home
   those sheep that belong to his fold not as yet collected, -- that he
   would grant faith and repentance, for the merit of his Son, to them
   that are as yet afar off, -- were this an altogether vain and foolish
   prayer? Let others think as they please, it is such a vanity as I
   desire not to be weaned from; nor any one else, I believe, that loves
   the Lord Jesus in sincerity. Oh, that Christians should patiently
   endure such a diminution of their Saviour's honour, as with one dash of
   an Arminian pen to have the chief effects of his death and passion
   quite obliterated! If this be a motive to the love and honour of the
   Son of God, if this be a way to set forth the preciousness of his
   blood, by denying the efficacy thereof in enabling us by faith to get
   an interest in the new covenant, most Christians in the world are under
   a necessity of being new catechised by these seraphical doctors. Until
   when, they must give us leave to believe, with the apostle, that God
   "blesseth us with all spiritual blessings in Christ," Eph. i. 3; and we
   will take leave to account faith a spiritual blessing, and, therefore,
   bestowed on us for Christ's sake. Again; since our regeneration is
   nothing but a "purging of our consciences from dead works that we may
   serve the living God," which being done by "the blood of Christ," as
   the apostle witnesseth, Heb. ix. 14, we will ascribe our new birth, or
   forming anew, to the virtue of that grace which is purchased by his
   blood; that "precious blood" it is which "redeemeth us from our vain
   conversation," 1 Pet. i. 18, 19, by whose efficacy we are vindicated
   from the state of sin and corrupted nature wherein we are born.

   The Arminians have but one argument, that ever I could meet with,
   whereby they strive to rob Christ of this glory of meriting and
   procuring for us faith and repentance; and that is, because they are
   such acts of ours as in duty and obedience to the precepts of the
   gospel we are bound to perform; [167] and this they everywhere press at
   large, "usque et usque." In plain terms, they will not suffer their
   idol to be accounted defective in any thing that is necessary to bring
   us unto heaven. Now, concerning this argument, that nothing which God
   requireth of us can be procured for us by Christ, I would have two
   things noted:-- First, That the strength of it consists in this, that
   no gift of God bestowed upon us can be a thing well-pleasing to him, as
   being in us, for all his precepts and commands signify only what is
   well-pleasing unto him that we should be or do; and it is not the
   meriting of any thing by Christ, but God's bestowing of it as the
   effect thereof, which hinders it from being a thing requirable of us as
   a part of our duty: which I shall consider hereafter. Only now observe,
   that there being nothing in us, by the way of habit or act, from the
   beginning of our faith to the consummation thereof, from our new birth
   until we become perfect men in Christ by the finishing of our course,
   that is not required of us in the gospel, all and every grace whereof
   we are in this life partakers are, by this means, denied to be the
   gifts of God. Secondly, Consider the extent of this argument itself.
   Nothing whose performance is our duty can be merited for us by Christ.
   When the apostle beseecheth us to be "reconciled unto God," I would
   know whether it be not a part of our duty to yield obedience to the
   apostle's exhortation? If not, his exhortation is frivolous and vain:
   if so, then to be reconciled unto God is a part of our duty; and yet
   the Arminians sometimes seem to confess that Christ hath obtained for
   us a reconciliation with God. The like may be said in divers other
   particulars. So that this argument either proveth that we enjoy no
   fruit of the death of Christ in this life, or (which is most true) it
   proveth nothing at all; for neither the merit of Christ procuring nor
   God bestowing any grace in the habit doth at all hinder but that, in
   the exercise thereof, it may be a duty of ours, inasmuch as it is done
   in us and by us. Notwithstanding, then, this exception, -- which cannot
   stand by itself alone without the help of some other not as yet
   discovered, -- we will continue our prayers, as we are commanded, in
   the name of Christ; that is, that God would bestow upon us those things
   we ask for Christ's sake, and that by an immediate collation, yea, even
   then when we cry with the poor penitent, "Lord, help our unbelief," or
   with the apostles, "Lord, increase our faith."

   Secondly, The second plea on God's behalf, to prove him the author and
   finisher of all those graces whereof in this life we are partakers,
   ariseth from what the Scripture affirmeth concerning his working these
   graces in us, and that powerfully, by the effectual operation of his
   Holy Spirit. To which the Arminians oppose a seeming necessity that
   they must needs be our own acts, contradistinct from his gifts, because
   they are in us and commanded by him. The head, then, of this contention
   betwixt our God and their idol about the living child of grace is,
   whether he can work that in us which he requireth of us. Let us hear
   them pleading their cause:--

   [168] "It is most certain that that ought not to be commanded which is
   wrought in us; and that cannot be wrought in us which is commanded. He
   foolishly commandeth that to be done of others who will work in them
   what he commandeth," saith their Apology. O foolish St Prosper, who
   thought that it was the whole Pelagian heresy to say, [169] "That there
   is neither praise nor worth, as ours, in that which Christ bestoweth
   upon us!" Foolish St Augustine, praying, [170] "Give us, O Lord, what
   thou commandest, and command what thou wilt!" Foolish Benedict, bishop
   of Rome, who gave such a form to his prayer as must needs cast an
   aspersion of folly on the Most High! [171] "O Lord," saith he, "teach
   us what we should do; show us whither we should go; work in us what we
   ought to perform." O foolish fathers of the second Arausican council,
   affirming, [172] "That many good things are done in man which he doth
   not himself; but a man doth no good which God doth not so work that he
   should do it!" And again, "As often as we do good, God worketh in us
   and with us, that we may so work." In one word, this makes fools of all
   the doctors of the church who ever opposed the Pelagian heresy,
   inasmuch as they all unanimously maintained that we are partakers of no
   good thing in this kind without the effectual powerful operation of the
   almighty grace of God, and yet our faith and obedience, so wrought in
   us, to be most acceptable unto him. Yea, what shall we say to the Lord
   himself, in one place commanding us to fear him, and in another
   promising that he will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall not
   depart from him? Is his command foolish, or his promise false? The
   Arminians must affirm the one or renounce their heresy. But of this,
   after I have a little farther laid open this monstrous error from their
   own words and writings.

   [173] "Can any one," say they, "wisely and seriously prescribe the
   performance of a condition to another, under the promise of a reward
   and threatening of punishment, who will effect it in him to whom it is
   prescribed? This is a ridiculous action, scarce worthy of the stage."
   That is, seeing Christ hath affirmed that "he that believeth shall be
   saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned," Mark xvi. 16,
   whereby faith is established the condition of salvation, and unbelief
   threatened with hell, if God should by his Holy Spirit ingenerate faith
   in the hearts of any, causing them so to fulfil the condition, it were
   a mere mockery, to be exploded from a theatre as an unlikely fiction;
   which, what an aspersion it casts upon the whole gospel of Christ, yea,
   on all God's dealings with the children of men ever since, by reason of
   the fall, they became unable of themselves to fulfil his commands, I
   leave to all men's silent judgment. Well, then, seeing they must be
   accounted asustata, things inconsistent, that God should be so
   righteous as to show us our duty, and yet so good and merciful as to
   bestow his graces on us, let us hear more of this stuff, [174] "Faith
   and conversion cannot be our obedience, if they are wrought in us by
   God," say they at the Hague; and Episcopius, [175] "That it is a most
   absurd thing to affirm that God either effects by his power, or
   procureth by his wisdom, that the elect should do those things that he
   requireth of them." So that where the Scripture calls faith the gift
   and work of God, they say it is an improper locution, inasmuch as he
   commands it; properly, it is an act or work of our own. And for that
   renowned saying of St Augustine, that [176] "God crowneth his own gifts
   in us," "it is not to be received without a grain of salt;" that is,
   some such gloss as wherewith they corrupt the Scripture. The sum at
   which they aim is, that to affirm that God bestoweth any graces upon
   us, or effectually worketh them in us, contradicteth his word requiring
   them as our duty and obedience. By which means they have erected their
   idol into the throne of God's free grace and mercy, and attribute unto
   it all the praise due to those many heavenly qualifications the
   servants of God are endowed withal, for they never have more good in
   them, no, nor so much, as is required; all that they have or do is but
   their duty; -- which, how derogatory it is to the merit of Christ,
   themselves seem to acknowledge, when they affirm that he is no
   otherwise said to be a Saviour than are all they who confirm the way to
   salvation by preaching, miracles, martyrdom, and example. So that,
   having quite overthrown the merits of Christ, [177] "they grant us to
   be our own saviours in a very large sense," Rem. Apol., fol. 96. All
   which assertions, how contrary they are to the express word of God, I
   shall now demonstrate.

   There is not one of all those plain texts of Scripture, not one of
   those innumerable and invincible arguments, whereby the effectual
   working of God's grace in the conversion of a sinner, his powerful
   translating us from death to life, from the state of sin and bondage to
   the liberty of the sons of God, which doth not overthrow this
   prodigious error. I will content myself with instancing in some few of
   them which are directly opposite unto it, even in terms:--

   First, Deut. x. 16, The Lord commandeth the Israelites to "circumcise
   the foreskin of their hearts, and to be no more stiff-necked;" so that
   the circumcising of their hearts was a part of their obedience, -- it
   was their duty so to do, in obedience to God's command. And yet, in the
   30th chapter, verse 6, he affirmeth that "he will circumcise their
   hearts, that they might love the Lord their God with all their hearts."
   So that, it seems, the same thing, in diverse respects, may be God's
   act in us and our duty towards him. And how the Lord will here escape
   that Arminian censure, that if his words be true in the latter place,
   his command in the former is vain and foolish, "ipse viderit," -- let
   him plead his cause, and avenge himself on those that rise up against
   him.

   Secondly, Ezek. xviii. 31, "Make you a new heart and a new spirit: for
   why will ye die, O house of Israel?" The making of a new heart and a
   new spirit is here required under a promise of a reward of life, and a
   great threatening of eternal death; so that so to do must needs be a
   part of their duty and obedience. And yet, chap. xxxvi. 26, 27, he
   affirmeth that he will do this very thing that here he requireth of
   them: "A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you an heart of flesh; and I will cause you to walk in my
   statutes," etc. In how many places, also, are we commanded to "fear the
   Lord!" which, when we do, I hope none will deny it to be a performance
   of our duty; and yet, Jer. xxxii. 40, God promiseth that "he will put
   his fear in our hearts, that we shall not depart from him."

   Thirdly, Those two against which they lay particular exceptions, faith
   and repentance, are also expressly attributed to the free donation of
   God: He "granteth unto the Gentiles repentance unto life," Acts xi. 18;
   and of faith directly, "It is not of ourselves, it is the gift of God,"
   Eph. ii. 8. To which assertion of the Holy Spirit I shall rather fasten
   my belief than to the Arminians, affirming that it is no gift of God
   because it is of ourselves; and yet this hindereth not but that it may
   be styled, "Our most holy faith," Jude 20. Let them that will, deny
   that any thing can properly be ours which God bestoweth on us; the
   prophet accounted them not inconsistent when he averred that "the Lord
   worketh all our works in us," Isa. xxvi. 12. They are our works, though
   of his working. The apostle laboured; though it was not he, but "the
   grace of God that was with him," 1 Cor. xv. 10. He "worketh in us kai
   to thelein kai to energein of his good pleasure," Phil. ii. 13; and yet
   the performance of our duty may consist in those acts of our wills and
   those good deeds whereof he is the author. So that, according to St
   Austin's counsel, [178] we will still pray that he would bestow what he
   commandeth us to have.

   Fourthly, 1 Cor. iv. 7, "Who maketh thee to differ from another? and
   what hast thou that thou didst not receive?" Every thing that makes us
   differ from others is received from God; wherefore, the foundation of
   all difference in spiritual things between the sons of Adam being faith
   and repentance, they must also of necessity be received from above. In
   brief, God's "circumcising our hearts," Col. ii. 11, his "quickening us
   when we are dead," Eph. ii. 1, 2, begetting us anew, John i. 13, making
   us in all things such as he would have us to be, is contained in that
   promise of the new covenant, Jer. xxxii. 40, "I will make an
   everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to
   do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall
   not depart from me;" and is no way repugnant to the holy Scripture,
   declaring our duty to be all this that the Lord would have us. And now,
   let all men judge whether, against so many and clear testimonies of the
   Holy Ghost, the Arminian reasons, borrowed from the old philosophers,
   be of any value. The sum of them all you may find in Cicero, his third
   book De Natura Deorum. [179] "Every one," saith he, "obtaineth virtue
   for himself; never any wise man thanked God for that: for our virtue we
   are praised; in virtue we glory, which might not be were it a gift of
   God." And truly this, in softer terms, is the sum of the Remonstrants'
   arguments in this particular.

   Lastly, Observe, that this error is that which, of all others, the
   orthodox fathers did most oppose in the Pelagian heretics; yea, and to
   this day, [180] the more learned schoolmen stoutly maintain the truth
   herein against the innovating Jesuits. With some few of the testimonies
   of the ancients I will shut up this discourse. [181] "It is certain
   that when we do any thing, we do it," saith St Augustine; "but it is
   God that causeth us so to do." And in another place, [182] "Shall we
   not account that to be the gift of God, because it is required of us
   under the promise of eternal life? God forbid that this should seem so,
   either to the partakers or defenders of grace;" where he rejecteth both
   the error and the sophism wherewith it is upholden. So also Coelestius,
   bishop of Rome, in his epistle to the bishops of France. [183] "So
   great," saith he, "is the goodness of God towards men, that he will
   have those good things to be our good duties" (he calls them merits,
   according to the phrase of those days) "which are his own gifts;" to
   which purpose I cited before two canons out of the Arausican council.
   And St Prosper, in his treatise against Cassianus the semi-Pelagian,
   affirmeth it to be a foolish complaint of proud men [184] "that
   free-will is destroyed, if the beginning, progress, and continuance in
   good be said to be the gifts of God." And so the imputation of folly,
   wherewith the Arminians in my first quotation charge their opposers,
   being retorted on them by this learned father, I refer you to these
   following excerpta for a close:--

   spirit, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" Ezek. xviii. 31. "A
   new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you,"

   "This is most certain, that that ought not to be commanded which is

   following the Lord your God," 1 Sam. xii. 14. "I will put my fear in
   their hearts, that they shall not depart from me," Jer. xxxii. 40.

   "It is absurd to affirm that God either worketh by his power, or

   God requireth of them," Episcop.

                                  Chapter XI.

   Whether salvation may be attained without the knowledge of, or faith
   in, Christ Jesus.

   I shall shut up all this discourse concerning the meritorious cause of
   salvation, with their shutting out of Christ from being the only one
   and absolutely necessary means to bring us unto heaven, to make us
   happy. This is the last pile they erect upon their Babylonish
   foundation, which makes the idol of human self-sufficiency every way
   perfect, and fit to be sacrificed unto. Until these proud builders, to
   get materials for their own temple, laid the axe to the root of
   Christianity, we took it for granted that "there is no salvation in any
   other," because "there is none other name under heaven given unto men
   whereby we must be saved," Acts iv. 12. Neither yet shall their
   nefarious attempts frighten us from our creed, nor make us be wanting
   to the defense of our Saviour's honour. But I shall be very brief in
   the consideration of this heterodoxy, nothing doubting but that to have
   repeated it is fully to have confuted it, in the judgment of all pious
   Christians.

   First, then, They grant salvation to the ancient patriarchs and Jews,
   before the coming of Christ, without any knowledge of or faith in him
   at all; nay, they deny that any such faith in Christ was ever
   prescribed unto them or required of them. [185] "It is certain that
   there is no place in the Old Testament from whence it may appear that
   faith in Christ as a Redeemer was ever enjoined or found in any of
   them," say they jointly in their Apology; the truth of which assertion
   we shall see hereafter. Only they grant a general faith, involved under
   types and shadows, and looking on the promise as it lay hid in the
   goodness and providence of God, which indirectly might be called a
   faith in Christ: from which kind of faith I see no reason why thousands
   of heathen infidels should be excluded. Agreeable unto these assertions
   are the dictates of their patriarch Arminius, affirming, [186] "that
   the whole description of the faith of Abraham, Rom. iv., makes no
   mention of Jesus Christ, either expressly or so implicitly as that it
   may be of any one easily understood." And to the testimony of Christ
   himself to the contrary, John viii. 56, "Your father Abraham rejoiced
   to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad," he answereth, "He rejoiced
   to see the birth of Isaac, who was a type of me," -- a goodly gloss,
   corrupting the text.

   Secondly, What they teach of the Jews, that also they grant concerning
   the Gentiles living before the incarnation of Christ; they also might
   attain salvation, and be justified without his knowledge. [187] "For
   although," saith Corvinus, "the covenant was not revealed unto them by
   the same means that it was unto the Jews, yet they are not to be
   supposed to be excluded from the covenant" (of grace), "nor to be
   excluded from salvation; for some way or other they were called."

   Thirdly, They are come at length to that perfection in setting out this
   stain of Christianity, that Bertius, on good consideration, denied this
   proposition, [188] "That no man can be saved that is not ingrafted into
   Christ by a true faith;" and Venator to this question, [189] "Whether
   the only means of salvation be the life, passion, death, resurrection,
   and ascension of Jesus Christ?" answereth, "No." Thus they lay men in
   Abraham's bosom who never believed in the Son of Abraham; make them
   overcome the serpent who never heard of the Seed of the woman; bring
   goats into heaven, who never were of the flock of Christ, never entered
   by him, the door; make men please God without faith, and obtain the
   remission of sins without the sprinkling of the blood of the Lamb, --
   to be saved without a Saviour, redeemed without a Redeemer, -- to
   become the sons of God, and never know their elder Brother; -- which
   prodigious error might yet be pardoned, and ascribed to human
   imbecility, had it casually slipped from their pens, as it did from
   some others. [190] But seeing it hath foundation in all the grounds of
   their new doctrine, and is maintained by them on mature deliberation,
   [191] it must be looked on by all Christians as a heresy to be detested
   and accursed. For, first, deny the contagion and demerit of original
   sin; then make the covenant of grace to be universal, and to comprehend
   all and every one of the posterity of Adam; thirdly, grant a power in
   ourselves to come unto God by any such means as he will appoint, and
   affirm that he doth assign some means unto all, -- and it will
   naturally follow that the knowledge of Christ is not absolutely
   necessary to salvation, and so down falls the pre-eminence of
   Christianity; its heaven-reaching crown must be laid level with the
   services of dunghill gods. [192]

   It is true, indeed, some of the ancient fathers, before the rising of
   the Pelagian heresy, -- who had so put on Christ, as Lipsius speaks,
   that they had not fully put off Plato, -- have unadvisedly dropped some
   speeches seeming to grant that divers men before the incarnation,
   living meta logou, "according to the dictates of right reason," might
   be saved without faith in Christ; as is well showed by learned Casaubon
   in his first exercitation on Baronius. But let this be accounted part
   of that stubble which shall burn at the last day, wherewith the
   writings of all men not divinely inspired may be stained. It hath also
   since (as what hath not?) been drawn into dispute among the wrangling
   schoolmen; and yet, which is rarely seen, their verdict in this
   particular almost unanimously passeth for the truth. Aquinas [193]
   tells us a story of the corpse of a heathen, that should be taken up in
   the time of the Empress Irene and her son Constantine, with a golden
   plate on his breast, wherein was this inscription:-- "Christ is born of
   a virgin, and I believe in him. O sun, thou shalt see me again in the
   days of Irene and Constantine." But the question is not, Whether a
   Gentile believing in Christ may be saved? or whether God did not reveal
   himself and his Son extraordinarily to some of them? for shall we
   straiten the breast and shorten the arm of the Almighty, as though he
   might not do what he will with his own; but, Whether a man by the
   conduct of nature, without the knowledge of Christ, may come to heaven?
   the assertion whereof we condemn as a wicked, Pelagian, Socinian
   heresy, and think that it was well said of Bernard, [194] "That many
   labouring to make Plato a Christian, do prove themselves to be
   heathens." And if we look upon the several branches of this Arminian
   novel doctrine, extenuating the precious worth and necessity of faith
   in Christ, we shall find them hewed off by the two-edged sword of God's
   word.

   First, For their denying the patriarchs and Jews to have had faith "in
   Christum exhibendum et moriturum," as we in him "exhibitum et mortuum,"
   it is disproved, --

   First, By all evangelical promises made from the beginning of the world
   to the birth of our Saviour; as that, Gen. iii. 15, "The seed of the
   woman shall break the serpent's head;" and chap. xii. 3, xlix. 10; Ps.
   ii. 7, 8, cx.; with innumerable others concerning his life, office, and
   redeeming of his people: for surely they were obliged to believe the
   promises of God.

   Secondly, By those many clear expressions of his death, passion, and
   suffering for us, as Gen. iii. 15; Isa. liii. 6-10, etc., lxiii. 1-3;
   Dan. ix. 26. But what need we reckon any more? Our Saviour taught his
   disciples that all the prophets from Moses spake concerning him, and
   that the sole reason why they did not so readily embrace the faith of
   his passion and resurrection was because they believed not the
   prophets, Luke xxiv. 25, 26; showing plainly that the prophets required
   faith in his death and passion.

   Thirdly, By the explicit faith of many Jews, as of old Simeon, Luke ii.
   34; of the Samaritan woman, who looked for a Messiah, not as an earthly
   king, but as one that should "tell them all things," -- redeem them
   from sin, and tell them all such things as Christ was then discoursing
   of, concerning the worship of God, John iv. 25.

   Fourthly, By the express testimony of Christ himself. "Abraham," saith
   he, "rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad," John viii.
   56. His day, his hour, in the Scripture, principally denote his
   passion. And that which he saw surely he believed, or else the father
   of the faithful was more diffident than Thomas, the most incredulous of
   his children.

   Fifthly, By these following, and the like places of Scripture: Christ
   is a "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," Rev. xiii. 8; slain
   in promises, slain in God's estimation and in the faith of believers.
   He is "the same yesterday, and today, and for ever," Heb. xiii. 8,
   under the law and the gospel. "There is none other name under heaven
   given unto men, whereby we must be saved," Acts iv. 12. Never any,
   then, without the knowledge of a Redeemer, participation of his
   passion, communication of his merits, did ever come to the sight of
   God; no man ever came to the Father but by him. Hence St Paul tells the
   Ephesians that they were "without Christ," because they were "aliens
   from the commonwealth of Israel," Eph. ii. 12; intimating that God's
   covenant with the Jews included Christ Jesus and his righteousness no
   less than it doth now with us. On these grounds holy Ignatius called
   Abel [195] "A martyr of Christ;" he died for his faith in the promised
   Seed. And in another place, [196] "All the saints were saved by Christ;
   hoping in him, and waiting on him, they obtained salvation by him." So
   Prosper, also, [197] "We must believe that never any man was justified
   by any other faith, either before the law or under the law, than by
   faith in Christ coming to save that which was lost." Whence Eusebius
   contendeth [198] that all the old patriarchs might properly be called
   Christians; they all ate of the same spiritual meat, and all drank of
   the same spiritual drink, even of the rock that followed them, which
   rock was Christ.

   Secondly, If the ancient people of God, notwithstanding divers other
   especial revelations of his will and heavenly instructions, obtained
   not salvation without faith in Christ, much less may we grant this
   happiness without him to them who were deprived of those other helps
   also. So that though we confess the poor natural endeavours of the
   heathen not to have wanted their reward (either positive in this life,
   by outward prosperity, and inward calmness of mind, in that they were
   not all perplexed and agitated with furies, like Nero and Caligula; or
   negative in the life to come, by a diminution of the degrees of their
   torments, -- they shall not be beaten with so many stripes), yet we
   absolutely deny that there is any saving mercy of God towards them
   revealed in the Scripture, which should give us the least intimation of
   their attaining everlasting happiness. For, not to consider the
   corruption and universal disability of nature to do anything that is
   good ("without Christ we can do nothing," John xv. 5), nor yet the
   sinfulness of their best works and actions, the "sacrifice of the
   wicked being an abomination unto the Lord," Prov. xv. 8 ("Evil trees
   cannot bring forth good fruit; men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor
   figs of thistles," Matt. vii. 16, 17); -- the word of God is plain,
   that "without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. xi. 6; that
   "he that believeth not is condemned," Mark xvi. 16; that no nation or
   person can be blessed but in the Seed of Abraham, Gen. xii. 3. And the
   "blessing of Abraham" comes upon the Gentiles only "through Jesus
   Christ," Gal. iii. 14. He is "the way, the truth, and the life," John
   xiv. 6. "None cometh to the Father but by him." He is the "door," by
   which those that do not enter are "without," with "dogs and idolaters,"
   Rev. xxii. 15. So that "other foundation" of blessedness "can no man
   lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ," 1 Cor. iii. 11. In
   brief, do but compare these two places of St Paul, Rom. viii. 30, where
   he showeth that none are glorified but those that are called; and chap.
   x. 14, 15, where he declares that all calling is instrumentally by the
   preaching of the word and gospel; and it will evidently appear that no
   salvation can be granted unto them on whom the Lord hath so far poured
   out his indignation as to deprive them of the knowledge of the sole
   means thereof, Christ Jesus. And to those that are otherwise minded, I
   give only this necessary caution, -- Let them take heed, lest, whilst
   they endeavour to invent new ways to heaven for others, by so doing,
   they lose the true way themselves.

                                  Chapter XII.

   Of free-will, the nature and power thereof.

   Our next task is to take a view of the idol himself, of this great
   deity of free-will, whose original being not well known, he is
   pretended, like the Ephesian image of Diana, to have fallen down from
   heaven, and to have his endowments from above. But yet, considering
   what a nothing he was at his first discovery in comparison of that vast
   giant-like hugeness to which now he is grown, we may say of him as the
   painter said of his monstrous picture, which he had mended or rather
   marred according to everyone's fancy, "Hunc populus fecit," -- it is
   the issue of the people's brain. Origen [199] is supposed to have
   brought him first into the church; but among those many sincere
   worshippers of divine grace, this setter forth of new demons found but
   little entertainment. It was looked upon but like the stump of Dagon,
   with his head and hands laid down before the ark of God, without whose
   help he could neither know nor do that which is good in any kind, still
   accounted but "truncus ficulnus, inutile lignum," -- "a fig-tree log,
   an unprofitable piece of wood." "Incerti patres scamnum facerentne?"
   The fathers of the succeeding ages had much debate to what use they
   should put it, and though some exalted it a degree or two above its
   merits, yet the most concluded to keep it a block still; until at
   length there arose a stout champion, [200] challenging on his behalf
   the whole church of God, and, like a knight-errant, wandered from the
   west to the east to grapple with any that should oppose his idol; who,
   though he met with divers adversaries, [201] one especially, [202] who
   in the behalf of the grace of God continually foiled him and cast him
   to the ground, and that in the judgment of all the lawful judges
   assembled in councils, [203] and in the opinion of most of the
   Christian bystanders, [204] yet, by his cunning insinuation, he planted
   such an opinion of his idol's deity and self-sufficiency in the hearts
   of divers, that to this day it could never be rooted out.

   Now, after the decease of his Pelagian worshippers, some of the
   corrupter schoolmen, seeing him thus from his birth exposed without
   shelter to wind and weather, to all assaults, out of mere charity and
   self-love built him a temple, and adorned it with natural lights,
   merits, uncontrolled independent operations, with many other gay
   attendances. But in the beginning of the Reformation, -- that fatal
   time for idolatry and superstition, together with abbeys and
   monasteries, -- the zeal and learning of our forefathers, with the help
   of God's word, demolished this temple, and brake this building down to
   the ground; in the rubbish whereof we well hoped the idol himself had
   been so deeply buried as that his head should never more have been
   exalted, to the trouble of the church of God, until not long since some
   curious wits, whose weak stomachs were clogged with manna and loathed
   the sincere milk of the word, raking all dunghills for novelties,
   lighted unhappily upon this idol, and presently, with no less joy than
   did the mathematician at the discovery of a new geometrical proportion,
   exclaim, "We have found it! we have found it!" And without more ado, up
   they erected a shrine, and until this day continue offering of praise
   and thanks for all the good they do to this work of their own hands.

   And that the idol may be free from ruin, to which in himself they have
   found by experience that he is subject, they have matched him to
   contingency, a new goddess of their own creation, who, having proved
   very fruitful in monstrous births upon their conjunctions, they nothing
   doubt they shall never want one to set on the throne and make president
   of all human actions: so that after he hath, with various success, at
   least twelve hundred years, contended with the providence and grace of
   God, he boasteth now as if he had obtained a total victory. But yet all
   his prevailing is to be attributed to the diligence and varnish of his
   new abettors, with (to our shame be it spoken!) the negligence of his
   adversaries. In him and his cause there is no more real worth than was
   when by the ancient fathers he was exploded and cursed out of the
   church: so that they who can attain, through the many winding
   labyrinths of curious distinctions, to look upon the thing itself,
   shall find that they have been, like Egyptian novices, brought through
   many stately frontispieces and goodly fabrics, with much show of zeal
   and devotion, to the image of an ugly ape.

   Yet here observe, that we do not absolutely oppose free-will, as if it
   were "nomen inane," a mere figment, when there is no such thing in the
   world, but only in that sense the Pelagians and Arminians do assert it.
   About words we will not contend. We grant man, in the substance of all
   his actions, as much power, liberty, and freedom as a mere created
   nature is capable of. We grant him to be free in his choice from all
   outward coaction, or inward natural necessity, to work according to
   election and deliberation, spontaneously embracing what seemeth good
   unto him. Now, call this power free-will, or what you please, so you
   make it not supreme, independent, and boundless, we are not at all
   troubled. The imposition of names depends upon the discretion of their
   inventers. Again; even in spiritual things, we deny that our wills are
   at all debarred, or deprived of their proper liberty: but here we say,
   indeed, that we are not properly free until the Son makes us free; --
   no great use of freedom in that wherein we can do nothing at all. We do
   not claim such a liberty as should make us despise the grace of God,
   [205] whereby we may attain true liberty indeed; which addeth to, but
   taketh nothing from, our original freedom. But of this after I have
   showed what an idol the Arminians make of free-will. Only take notice
   in the entrance that we speak of it now, not as it was at first by God
   created, but as it is now by sin corrupted; yet, being considered in
   that estate also, they ascribe more unto it than it was ever capable
   of. As it now standeth, according to my formerly-proposed method, I
   shall show, -- first, what inbred native virtue they ascribe unto it,
   and with how absolute a dominion and sovereignty over all our actions
   they endow it; secondly, what power they say it hath in preparing us
   for the grace of God; thirdly, how effectually operative it is in
   receiving the said grace, and with how little help thereof it
   accomplisheth the great work of our conversion; -- all briefly, with so
   many observations as shall suffice to discover their proud errors in
   each particular.

   [206] "Herein," saith Arminius, "consisteth the liberty of the will,
   that all things required to enable it to will any thing being
   accomplished, it still remains indifferent to will or not." And all of
   them at the synod: [207] "There is," say they, "accompanying the will
   of man an inseparable property, which we call liberty, from whence the
   will is termed a power, which, when all things pre-required as
   necessary to operation are fulfilled, may will anything, or not will
   it;" that is, our free-wills have such an absolute and uncontrollable
   power in the territory of all human actions, that no influence of God's
   providence, no certainty of his decree, no unchangeableness of his
   purpose, can sway it at all in its free determinations, or have any
   power with his highness to cause him to will or resolve on any such act
   as God by him intendeth to produce. Take an instance in the great work
   of our conversion. [208] "All unregenerate men," saith Arminius, "have,
   by virtue of their free-will, a power of resisting the Holy Spirit, of
   rejecting the offered grace of God, of contemning the counsel of God
   concerning themselves, of refusing the gospel of grace, of not opening
   the heart to him that knocketh." What a stout idol is this, whom
   neither the Holy Spirit, the grace and counsel of God, the calling of
   the gospel, the knocking at the door of the heart, can move at all, or
   in the least measure prevail against him! Woe be unto us, then, if when
   God calls us our free-will be not in good temper, and well disposed to
   hearken unto him! for it seems there is no dealing with it by any other
   ways, though powerful and almighty. [209] "For grant," saith Corvinus,
   "all the operations of grace which God can use in our conversion, yet
   conversion remaineth so in our own free power that we can be not
   converted; that is, we can either turn or not turn ourselves;" where
   the idol plainly challengeth the Lord to work his utmost, and tells him
   that after he hath so done he will do what he please. His infallible
   prescience, his powerful predetermination, the moral efficacy of the
   gospel, the infusion of grace, the effectual operation of the Holy
   Spirit, all are nothing, not at all available in helping or furthering
   our independent wills in their proceedings. Well, then, in what estate
   will you have the idol placed? [210] "In such a one wherein he may be
   suffered to sin, or to do well, at his pleasure," as the same author
   intimates. It seems, then, as to sin, so nothing is required for him to
   be able to do good but God's permission? No! For the Remonstrants [211]
   (as they speak of themselves) "do always suppose a free power of
   obeying or not obeying, as well in those who do obey as in those who do
   not obey;" -- that he that is obedient may therefore be counted
   obedient, because he obeyeth when he could not obey, and so on the
   contrary:" where all the praise of our obedience, whereby we are made
   to differ from others, is ascribed to ourselves alone, and that free
   power that is in us. Now, this they mean not of any one act of
   obedience, but of faith itself, and the whole consummation thereof.
   [212] "For if a man should say, that every man in the world hath a
   power of believing if he will, and of attaining salvation, and that
   this power is settled in his nature, what argument have you to confute
   him?" saith Arminius triumphantly to Perkins; where the sophistical
   innovator as plainly confounds grace and nature as ever did Pelagius.
   That, then, which the Arminians claim here in behalf of their free-will
   is, an absolute independence on God's providence in doing anything, and
   of his grace in doing that which is good, -- a self-sufficiency in all
   its operations, a plenary indifferency of doing what we will, this or
   that, as being neither determined to the one nor inclined to the other
   by any overruling influence from heaven. So that the good acts of our
   wills have no dependence on God's providence as they are acts, nor on
   his grace as they are good; but in both regards proceed from such a
   principle within us as is no way moved by any superior agent. Now, the
   first of these we deny unto our wills, because they are created; and
   the second, because they are corrupted. Their creation hinders them
   from doing anything of themselves without the assistance of God's
   providence; and their corruption, from doing anything that is good
   without his grace. A self-sufficiency for operation, without the
   effectual motion of Almighty God, the first cause of all things, we can
   allow neither to men nor angels, unless we intend to make them gods;
   and a power of doing good, equal unto that they have of doing evil, we
   must not grant to man by nature, unless we will deny the fall of Adam,
   and fancy ourselves still in paradise. But let us consider these things
   apart.

   First, I shall not stand to decipher the nature of human liberty, which
   perhaps would require a larger discourse than my proposed method will
   bear. It may suffice that, according to my former intimation, we grant
   as large a freedom and dominion to our wills over their own acts as a
   creature, subject to the supreme rule of God's providence, is capable
   of. Endued we are with such a liberty of will as is free from all
   outward compulsion and inward necessity, having an elective faculty of
   applying itself unto that which seems good unto it, in which it is a
   free choice; notwithstanding, it is subservient to the decree of God,
   as I showed before, chap. iv. Most free it is in all its acts, both in
   regard of the object it chooseth and in regard of that vital power and
   faculty whereby it worketh, infallibly complying with God's providence,
   and working by virtue of the motion thereof; but surely to assert such
   a supreme independency and every way unbounded indifferency as the
   Arminians claim, whereby, all other things requisite being
   pre-supposed, it should remain absolutely in our own power to will or
   not to will, to do anything or not to do it, is plainly to deny that
   our wills are subject to the rule of the Most High. It is granted that
   in such a chimerical, fancied consideration of free-will, wherein it is
   looked upon as having no relation to any act of God's but only its
   creation, abstracting from his decree, it may be said to have such a
   liberty in regard of the object; but the truth is, this divided sense
   is plain nonsense, a mere fiction of such an estate as wherein it never
   was, nor ever can be, so long as men will confess any deity but
   themselves, to whose determinations they must be subject. Until, then,
   more significant terms may be invented for this free power in our
   nature, which the Scripture never once vouchsafed to name, I shall be
   content to call it with Prosper, a [213] "spontaneous appetite of what
   seemeth good unto it," free from all compulsion, but subservient to the
   providence of God. And against its exaltation to this height of
   independency, I oppose, --

   First, Every thing that is independent of any else in operation is
   purely active, and so consequently a god; for nothing but a divine will
   can be a pure act, possessing such a liberty by virtue of its own
   essence. Every created will must have a liberty by participation, which
   includeth such an imperfect potentiality as cannot be brought into act
   without some premotion (as I may so say) of a superior agent. Neither
   doth this motion, being extrinsical, at all prejudice the true liberty
   of the will, which requireth, indeed, that the internal principle of
   operation be active and free, but not that that principle be not moved
   to that operation by an outward superior agent. Nothing in this sense
   can have an independent principle of operation which hath not an
   independent being. It is no more necessary to the nature of a free
   cause, from whence a free action must proceed, that it be the first
   beginning of it, than it is necessary to the nature of a cause that it
   be the first cause.

   Secondly, If the free acts of our wills are so subservient to the
   providence of God as that he useth them to what end he will, and by
   them effecteth many of his purposes, then they cannot of themselves be
   so absolutely independent as to have in their own power every necessary
   circumstance and condition, that they may use or not use at their
   pleasure. Now, the former is proved by all those reasons and texts of
   Scripture I before produced to show that the providence of God
   overruleth the actions and determineth the wills of men freely to do
   that which he hath appointed. And, truly, were it otherwise, God's
   dominion over the most things that are in the world were quite
   excluded; he had not power to determine that any one thing should ever
   come to pass which hath any reference to the wills of men.

   Thirdly, All the acts of the will being positive entities, were it not
   previously moved by God himself, "in whom we live, move, and have our
   being," must needs have their essence and existence solely from the
   will itself; which is thereby made auto on, a first and supreme cause,
   endued with an underived being. And so much to that particular.

   Let us now, in the second place, look upon the power of our freewill in
   doing that which is morally good; where we shall find not only an
   essential imperfection, inasmuch as it is created, but also a
   contracted effect, inasmuch as it is corrupted. The ability which the
   Arminians ascribe unto it in this kind, of doing that which is morally
   and spiritually good, is as large as themselves will confess to be
   competent unto it in the state of innocency, even a power of believing
   and a power of resisting the gospel, of obeying and not obeying, of
   turning or of not being converted.

   The Scripture, as I observed before, hath no such term at all, nor
   anything equivalent unto it. But the expressions it useth concerning
   our nature and all the faculties thereof, in this state of sin and
   unregeneration, seem to imply the quite contrary; as, that we are in
   "bondage," Heb. ii. 15; "dead in sins," Eph. ii. 1, and so "free from
   righteousness," Rom. vi. 20; "servants of sin," verse 17; under the
   "reign" and "dominion" thereof, verses 12, 14; all "our members being
   instruments of unrighteousness," verse 13; not "free indeed," until
   "the Son make us free." So that this idol of free-will, in respect of
   spiritual things, is not one whit better than the other idols of the
   heathen. Though it look like "silver and gold," it is the "work of
   men's hands." "It hath a mouth, but it speaketh not; it hath eyes, but
   it seeth not; it hath ears, but it heareth not; a nose, but it smelleth
   not; it hath hands, but it handleth not; feet, but it walketh not;
   neither speaketh it through its throat. They that made it are like unto
   it; and so is every one that trusteth in it. O Israel, trust thou in
   the Lord," etc., Ps. cxv. 4-9. That it is the work of men's hands, or a
   human invention, I showed before. For the rest, it hath a mouth
   unacquainted with the "mystery of godliness," "full only of cursing and
   bitterness," Rom. iii. 14; "speaking great swelling words," Jude 16;
   "great things, and blasphemies," Rev. xiii. 5; a "mouth causing the
   flesh to sin," Eccles. v. 6; -- his eyes are blind, not able to
   perceive those things that are of God, nor to know those things that
   are "spiritually discerned," 1 Cor. ii. 14; "eyes before which there is
   no fear of God," Rom. iii. 18; -- his "understanding is darkened,
   because of the blindness of his heart," Eph. iv. 18; "wise to do evil,
   but to do good he hath no knowledge," Jer. iv. 22; so that without
   farther light, all the world is but a mere "darkness," John i. 5; -- he
   hath ears, but they are like the ears of the "deaf adder" to the word
   of God, "refusing to hear the voice of charmers, charming never so
   wisely," Ps. lviii. 5; being "dead" when his voice first calls it, John
   v. 25; "ears stopped that they should not hear," Zech. vii. 11; "heavy
   ears" that cannot hear, Isa. vi. 10; -- a nose, to which the gospel is
   "the savour of death unto death," 2 Cor. ii. 16; -- "hands full of
   blood," Isa. i. 15; and "fingers defiled with iniquity," chap. lix. 3;
   -- feet, indeed, but, like Mephibosheth, lame in both by a fall, so
   that he cannot at all walk in the path of goodness; but "swift to shed
   blood, destruction and misery are in his ways, and the way of peace
   hath he not known," Rom. iii. 15-17. These, and divers other such
   endowments and excellent qualifications, doth the Scripture attribute
   to this idol, which it calls "The old man," as I shall more fully
   discover in the next chapter. And is not this a goodly reed whereon to
   rely in the paths of godliness? a powerful deity whereunto we may
   repair for a power to become the sons of God, and attain eternal
   happiness? The abilities of free-will in particular I shall consider
   hereafter; now only I will, by one or two reasons, show that it cannot
   be the sole and proper cause of any truly good and spiritual act,
   well-pleasing unto God.

   First, All spiritual acts well-pleasing unto God, as faith, repentance,
   obedience, are supernatural; flesh and blood revealeth not these
   things: "Not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
   man; but of God," John i. 13; "That which is born of the flesh is
   flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," chap. iii. 6.
   Now, to the performance of any supernatural act it is required that the
   productive power thereof be also supernatural; for nothing hath an
   activity in causing above its own sphere. "Nec imbelles generant
   feroces aquilas columbæ." But our free-will is a merely natural
   faculty, betwixt which and those spiritual, supernatural acts there is
   no proportion, unless it be advanced above its own orb, by inherent,
   habitual grace. Divine, theological virtues, differing even in the
   substance of the act from those moral performances about the same
   things to which the strength of nature may reach (for the difference of
   acts ariseth from their formal objects, which to both these are
   diverse), must have another principle and cause above all the power of
   nature in civil things and actions morally good, inasmuch as they are
   subject to a natural perception, and do not exceed the strength of our
   own wills. This faculty of free-will may take place, but yet not
   without these following limitations:--First, That it always requireth
   the general concurrence of God, whereby the whole suppositum in which
   free-will hath its subsistence may be sustained, Matt. x. 29, 30.
   Secondly, That we do all these things imperfectly and with much
   infirmity; every degree, also, of excellency in these things must be
   counted a special gift of God, Isa. xxvi. 12. Thirdly, That our wills
   are determined by the will of God to all their acts and motions in
   particular; but to do that which is spiritually good we have no
   knowledge, no power.

   Secondly, That concerning which I gave one special instance, in whose
   production the Arminians attribute much to free-will, is faith. This
   they affirm (as I showed before) to be inbred in nature, everyone
   having in him from his birth a natural power to believe in Christ and
   his gospel; for Episcopius denies that [214] "any action of the Holy
   Spirit upon the understanding or will is necessary, or promised in the
   Scripture, to make a man able to believe the word preached unto him."
   So that it seems every man hath at all times a power to believe, to
   produce the act of faith upon the revelation of its object: which gross
   Pelagianism is contrary, --

   First, To the doctrine of the church of England, alarming that a man
   cannot so much as prepare himself by his own strength to faith and
   calling upon God, until the grace of God by Christ prevent him, that he
   may have a good will. -- Artic. x.

   Secondly, To the Scripture, teaching that it is "the work of God that
   we do believe," John vi. 29. It is "not of ourselves; it is the gift of
   God," Eph. ii. 8. To some "it is given to know the mysteries of the
   kingdom of heaven," Matt. xiii. 11. And what is peculiarly given to
   some cannot be in the power of everyone: "To you it is given in the
   behalf of Christ to believe on him," Phil. i. 29. Faith is our access
   or coming unto Christ; which none can do "except the Father draw him,"
   John vi. 44; and he so draweth, or "hath mercy, on whom he will have
   mercy," Rom. ix. 18. And although Episcopius rejects any immediate
   action of the Holy Spirit for the ingenerating of faith, yet St Paul
   affirmeth that there is no less effectual power required to it than
   that which raised Christ from the dead; which, sure, was an action of
   the almighty Godhead. "That ye may know," saith he, "what is the
   exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to
   the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he
   raised him from the dead," Eph. i. 18-20. So that, let the Arminians
   say what they please, recalling that I write to Christians, I will
   spare my labour of farther proving that faith is the free gift of God;
   and their opposition to the truth of the Scripture in this particular
   is so evident to the meanest capacity that there needs no
   recapitulation to present the sum of it to their understandings.

                                 Chapter XIII.

   Of the power of free-will in preparing us for our conversion unto God.

   The judgment of the Arminians concerning the power of free-will about
   spiritual things in a man unregenerate, merely in the state of
   corrupted nature, before and without the help of grace, may be laid
   open by these following positions:--

   First, That every man in the world, reprobates and others, have in
   themselves power and ability of believing in Christ, of repenting and
   yielding due obedience to the new covenant; and that because they lost
   not this power by the fall of Adam. [215] "Adam after his fall," saith
   Grevinchovius, "retained a power of believing; and so did all
   reprobates in him." [216] "He did not lose" (as they speak at the
   synod) "the power of performing that obedience which is required in the
   new covenant considered formally, as it is required by the new
   covenant; he lost not a power of believing, nor a power of forsaking
   sin by repentance." And those graces that he lost not are still in our
   power. Whence they affirm, that [217] "faith is called the work of God
   only because he requireth us to do it." Now, having appropriated this
   power unto themselves, to be sure that the grace of God be quite
   excluded, which before they had made needless, they teach, --

   Secondly, That for the reducing of this power into act, that men may
   become actual believers, there is no infused habit of grace, no
   spiritual vital principle, necessary for them, or bestowed upon them;
   but everyone, by the use of his native endowments, doth make himself
   differ from others. [218] "Those things which are spoken concerning the
   infusion of habits before we can exercise the act of faith, we reject,"
   saith the epistle to the Walachians. [219] "That the internal principle
   of faith required in the gospel is a habit divinely infused, by the
   strength and efficacy whereof the will should be determined, I deny,"
   saith another of them. Well, then, if we must grant that the internal
   vital principle of a supernatural spiritual grace is a mere natural
   faculty, not elevated by any divine habit, -- if it be not God that
   begins the good work in us, but our own free-wills, -- let us see what
   more goodly stuff will follow. One man by his own mere endeavours,
   without the aid of any received gift, makes himself differ from
   another. [220] "What matter is it in that, that a man should make
   himself differ from others? There is nothing truer; he who yieldeth
   faith to God commanding him, maketh himself differ from him who will
   not have faith when he commandeth." They are the words of their
   Apology, which, without question, is an irrefragable truth, if faith be
   not a gift received from above; for on that ground only the apostle
   proposeth these questions, "Who maketh thee to differ from another? and
   what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive,
   why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received?" The sole cause why
   he denies anyone by his own power to make himself differ from another
   is, because that wherein the difference consisteth is "received," being
   freely bestowed upon him. Deny this, and I confess the other will fall
   of itself. But until their authority he equal with the apostles', they
   would do well to forbear the naked obtrusion of assertions so
   contradictory to theirs; and so they would not trouble the church. Let
   them take all the glory unto themselves, as doth Grevinchovius [221] "I
   make myself," saith he, "differ from another when I do not resist God
   and his divine predetermination; which I could have resisted. And why
   may I not boast of this as of mine own? That I could is of God's mercy"
   (endowing his nature with such an ability as you heard before); "but
   that I would, when I might have done otherwise, is of my power." Now,
   when, after all this, they are forced to confess some evangelical
   grace, though consisting only in a moral persuasion by the outward
   preaching of the word, they teach, --

   Thirdly, That God sendeth the gospel, and revealeth Christ Jesus unto
   men, according as they well dispose themselves for such a blessing.
   [222] "Sometimes," say they in their synodical writings, "God calleth
   this or that nation, people, city, or person, to the communion of
   evangelical grace, whom he himself pronounceth worthy of it, in
   comparison of others." So that whereas, Acts xviii. 10, God encourageth
   Paul to preach at Corinth by affirming that he had "much people in that
   city" (which, doubtless, were his people then only by virtue of their
   election), in these men's judgments [223] "they were called so because
   that even then they feared God, and served him with all their hearts,
   according to that knowledge they had of him, and so were ready to obey
   the preaching of St Paul." Strange doctrine, that men should fear God,
   know him, serve him in sincerity, before they ever heard of the gospel,
   and by these means deserve that it should be preached unto them! This
   is that pleasing of God before faith that they plead for, Act. Synod.,
   p. 66; that [224] "preparation and disposition to believe, which men
   attain by the law and virtuous education;" that "something which is in
   sinners, [225] whereby though they are not justified, yet they are made
   worthy of justification." For [226] "conversion and the performance of
   good works is," in their apprehension, "a condition pre-required to
   justification," for so speak the children of Arminius; which if it be
   not an expression not to be paralleled in the writings of any
   Christian, I am something mistaken. The sum of their doctrine, then, in
   this particular concerning the power of free-will in the state of sin
   and unregeneration, is, That every man having a native, inbred power of
   believing in Christ upon the revelation of the gospel, hath also an
   ability of doing so much good as shall procure of God that the gospel
   be preached unto him; to which, without any internal assistance of
   grace, he can give assent and yield obedience; the preparatory acts of
   his own will always proceeding so far as to make him excel others who
   do not perform them, and are therefore excluded from farther grace; --
   which is more gross Pelagianism than Pelagius himself would ever
   justify. Wherefore we reject all the former positions, as so many
   monsters in Christian religion, in whose room we assert these that
   follow:--

   First, That we, being by nature dead in trespasses and sins, have no
   power to prepare ourselves for the receiving of God's grace, nor in the
   least measure to believe and turn ourselves unto him. Not that we deny
   that there are any conditions pre-required in us for our conversion,
   dispositions preparing us in some measure for our new birth or
   regeneration; but we affirm that all these also are the effects of the
   grace of God, relating to that alone as their proper cause, for of
   ourselves, "without him, we can do nothing," John xv. 5. "We are not
   sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves," 2 Cor.
   iii. 5, much less do that which is good. In respect of that, "every one
   of our mouths must be stopped;" for "we have all sinned and come short
   of the glory of God," Rom. iii. 19, 23. We are "by nature the children
   of wrath, dead in trespasses and sins," Eph. ii. 1-3; Rom. viii. 6. Our
   new birth is a resurrection from death, wrought by the greatness of
   God's power. And what ability, I pray, hath a dead man to prepare
   himself for his resurrection? Can he collect his scattered dust, or
   renew his perished senses? If the leopard can change his spots, and the
   Ethiopian his skin, then can we do good who by nature are taught to do
   evil, Jer. xiii. 23. We are all "ungodly," and "without strength"
   considered, when Christ died for us, Rom. v. 6; "wise to do evil," but
   "to do good we have no strength, no knowledge." Yea, all the faculties
   of our souls, by reason of that spiritual death under which we are
   detained by the corruption of nature, are altogether useless, in
   respect of any power for the doing of that which is truly good. Our
   understandings are blind or "darkened, being alienated from the life of
   God through the ignorance that is in us, because of the blindness of
   our hearts," Eph. iv. 18; whereby we become even "darkness" itself,
   chap. v. 8. So void is the understanding of true knowledge, that "the
   natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; they are
   foolishness unto him," 1 Cor. ii. 14. [He is] nothing but confounded
   and amazed at spiritual things; and, if he doth not mock, can do
   nothing but wonder, and say, "What meaneth this?" Acts ii. 12, 13.
   Secondly, we are not only blind in our understandings, but captives
   also to sin in our wills, Luke iv. 18; whereby "we are servants of
   sin," John viii. 34; "free" only in our obedience to that tyrant, Rom.
   vi. 20. Yea, thirdly, all our affections are wholly corrupted, for
   "every imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man is only evil
   continually," Gen. vi. 5. While we are "in the flesh, the motions of
   sin do work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death," Rom. vii.
   5.

   These are the endowments of our nature, these are the preparations of
   our hearts for the grace of God, which we have within ourselves. Nay,
   --

   Secondly, There is not only an impotency but an enmity in corrupted
   nature to anything spiritually good: The things that are of God are
   "foolishness unto a natural man," 1 Cor. ii. 14. And there is nothing
   that men do more hate and contemn than that which they account as
   folly. They mock at it as a ridiculous drunkenness, Acts ii. 13. And
   would to God our days yielded us not too evident proofs of that
   universal opposition that is between light and darkness, Christ and
   Belial, nature and grace, -- that we could not see every day the
   prodigious issues of this inbred corruption swelling over all bounds,
   and breaking forth into a contempt of the gospel and all ways of
   godliness! So true it is that "the carnal mind is enmity against God:
   it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be," Rom. viii.
   7. So that, --

   Thirdly, As a natural man, by the strength of his own free-will,
   neither knoweth nor willeth, so it is utterly impossible he should do
   anything pleasing unto God. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots? then can he do good," Jer. xiii. 23. "An evil tree
   cannot bring forth good fruit." "Without faith it is impossible to
   please God," Heb. xi. 6; and "that is not of ourselves, it is the gift
   of God," Eph. ii. 8. So that though Almighty God, according to the
   unsearchableness of his wisdom, worketh divers ways and in sundry
   manners, for the translating of his chosen ones from the power of
   darkness into his marvellous light, -- calling some powerfully in the
   midst of their march in the way of ungodliness, as he did Paul, --
   preparing others by outward means and helps of common restraining
   grace, moralizing nature before it be begotten anew by the immortal
   seed of the word, -- yet this is certain, that all good in this kind is
   from his free grace; there is nothing in ourselves, as of ourselves,
   but sin. Yea, and all those previous dispositions wherewith our hearts
   are prepared, by virtue of common grace, do not at all enable us to
   concur, by any vital operation, with that powerful, blessed, renewing
   grace of regeneration whereby we become the sons of God. Neither is
   there any disposition unto grace so remote as that possibly it can
   proceed from a mere faculty of nature, for every such disposition must
   be of the same order with the form that is to be introduced; but
   nature, in respect of grace, is a thing of an inferior alloy, between
   which there is no proportion. A good use of gifts may have a promise of
   an addition of more, provided it be in the same kind. There is no rule,
   law, or promise that should make grace due upon the good use of natural
   endowments. But you will say, here I quite overthrow free-will, which
   before I seemed to grant. To which I answer, that in regard of that
   object concerning which now we treat, a natural man hath no such thing
   as free-will at all, if you take it for a power of doing that which is
   good and well-pleasing unto God in things spiritual, for an ability of
   preparing our hearts unto faith and calling upon God, as our church
   article speaks, a home-bred self-sufficiency, preceding the change of
   our wills by the almighty grace of God, whereby any good should be said
   to dwell in us; and we utterly deny that there is any such thing in the
   world. The will, though in itself radically free, yet in respect of the
   term or object to which in this regard it should tend, is corrupted,
   enthralled, and under a miserable bondage; tied to such a necessity of
   sinning in general, that though unregenerate men are not restrained to
   this or that sin in particular, yet for the main they can do nothing
   but sin. All their actions wherein there is any morality are attended
   with iniquity: "An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit;" even "the
   sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord." These things
   being thus cleared from the Scripture, the former Arminian positions
   will of themselves fall to the ground, having no foundation but their
   own authority; for any pretense of proof they make none from the word
   of God. The first two I considered in the last chapter, and now add
   only concerning the third, -- that the sole cause why the gospel is
   sent unto some and not unto others is, not any dignity, worth, or
   desert of it in them to whom it is sent, more than in the rest that are
   suffered to remain in the shadow of death, but only the sole good
   pleasure of God, that it may be a subservient means for the execution
   of his decree of election: "I have much people in this city," Acts
   xviii. 20; "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
   thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
   them unto babes. Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight,"
   Matt. xi. 25, 26. So that the Arminian opposition to the truth of the
   gospel in this particular is clearly manifest:--

                                  Chapter XIV.

   Of our conversion to God.

   How little or nothing at all it is that the Arminians assign to the
   grace of God, in performing the great work of our conversion, may
   plainly appear from what I have showed already that they ascribe to our
   own free-will, so that I shall briefly pass that over, which otherwise
   is so copiously delivered in holy Scripture that it would require a far
   larger discussion. A prolix confirmation of the truth we profess will
   not suit so well with my intention; which is merely to make a discovery
   of their errors, by not knowing the depths whereof so many are deceived
   and inveigled.

   Two things, in this great conjunction of grace and nature, the
   Arminians ascribe unto free-will:-- first, A power of co-operation and
   working with grace, to make it at all effectual; secondly, A power of
   resisting its operation, and making it altogether ineffectual; God in
   the meantime bestowing no grace but what awaits an act issuing from one
   of these two abilities, and hath its effect accordingly. If a man will
   co-operate, then grace attains its end; if he will resist, it returns
   empty. To this end they feign all the grace of God bestowed upon us for
   our conversion to be but a moral persuasion by his word, not an
   infusion of a new vital principle by the powerful working of the Holy
   Spirit. And, indeed, granting this, I shall most willingly comply with
   them in assigning to free-will one of the endowments before recited, --
   a power of resisting the operation of grace; but instead of the other,
   must needs ascribe to our whole corrupted nature, and everyone that is
   partaker of it, a universal disability of obeying it, or coupling in
   that work which God by his grace doth intend. If the grace of our
   conversion be nothing but a moral persuasion, we have no more power of
   obeying it in that estate wherein we are dead in sin, than a man in his
   grave hath in himself to live anew and come out at the next call. God's
   promises and the saints' prayers in the holy Scripture seem to design
   such a kind of grace as should give us a real internal ability of doing
   that which is spiritually good. But it seems there is no such matter;
   for if a man should persuade me to leap over the Thames, or to fly in
   the air, be he never so eloquent, his sole persuasion makes me no more
   able to do it than I was before ever I saw him. If God's grace be
   nothing but a sweet persuasion (though never so powerful), it is a
   thing extrinsical, consisting in the proposal of a desired object, but
   gives us no new strength at all to do anything we had not before a
   power to do. But let us hear them pleading themselves to each of these
   particulars concerning grace and nature. And, --

   First, for the nature of grace: [227] "God hath appointed to save
   believers by grace, -- that is, a soft and sweet persuasion, convenient
   and agreeing to their free-will, -- and not by any almighty action,"
   saith Arminius. It seems something strange, that "the carnal mind being
   enmity against God," and the will enthralled to sin, and full of
   wretched opposition to all his ways, yet God should have no other means
   to work them over unto him but some persuasion that is sweet,
   agreeable, and congruous unto them in that estate wherein they are. And
   a small exaltation it is of the dignity and power of grace, when the
   chief reason why it is effectual, as Alvarez observes, may be reduced
   to a well-digested supper or an undisturbed sleep, whereby some men may
   be brought into better temper than ordinary to comply with this
   congruous grace. But let us for the present accept of this, and grant
   that God doth call some by such a congruous persuasion, at such a time
   and place as he knows they will assent unto it. I ask whether God thus
   calleth all men, or only some? If all, why are not all converted? for
   the very granting of it to be congruous makes it effectual. If only
   some, then why them, and not others? Is it out of a special intention
   to have them obedient? But let them take heed, for this will go near to
   establish the decree of election; and out of what other intention it
   should be they shall never be able to determine. Wherefore [228]
   Corvinus denies that any such congruity is required to the grace
   whereby we are converted, but only that it be a moral persuasion; which
   we may obey if we will, and so make it effectual. Yea, and Arminius
   himself, after he had defended it as far as he was able, puts it off
   from himself, and falsely fathers it upon St Austin. So that, as they
   jointly affirm, [229] "they confess no grace for the begetting of faith
   to be necessary, but only that which is moral;" which one of them
   interpreteth to be [230] "a declaration of the gospel unto us;" --
   right like their old master, Pelagius. "God," saith he, [231] "worketh
   in us to will that which is good and to will that which is holy, whilst
   he stirs us up with promise of rewards and the greatness of the future
   glory, who before were given over to earthly desires, like brute
   beasts, loving nothing but things present, stirring up our stupid wills
   to a desire of God by a revelation of wisdom, and persuading us to all
   that is good." Both of them affirm the grace of God to be nothing but a
   moral persuasion, working by the way of powerful, convincing arguments;
   but yet herein Pelagius seems to ascribe a greater efficacy to it than
   the Arminians, granting that it works upon us when, after the manner of
   brute beasts, we are set merely on earthly things. But these, as they
   confess that, for the production of faith, [232] it is necessary that
   such arguments be proposed on the part of God to which nothing can
   probably be opposed why they should not seem credible; so there is, say
   they, required on our part a pious docility and probity of mind. So
   that all the grace of God bestowed on us consisteth in persuasive
   arguments out of the word; which, if they meet with teachable minds,
   may work their conversion.

   Secondly, Having thus extenuated the grace of God, they affirm, [233]
   "that in operation the efficacy thereof dependeth on free-will:" so the
   Remonstrants in their Apology. [234] "And to speak confidently," saith
   Grevinchovius, "I say that the effect of grace, in an ordinary course,
   dependeth on some act of our free-will." Suppose, then, that of two men
   made partakers of the same grace, -- that is, [who] have the gospel
   preached unto them by the same means, -- one is converted and the other
   is not, what may be the cause of this so great a difference? Was there
   any intention or purpose in God that one should be changed rather than
   the other? "No; he equally desireth and intendeth the conversion of all
   and every one." Did, then, God work more powerfully in the heart of the
   one by his Holy Spirit than of the other? "No; the same operation of
   the Spirit always accompanieth the same preaching of the word." But was
   not one, by some almighty action, made partaker of real infused grace,
   which the other attained not unto? "No; for that would destroy the
   liberty of his will, and deprive him of all the praise of believing."
   How, then, came this extreme difference of effects? who made the one
   differ from the other? or what hath he that he did not receive? "Why,
   all this proceedeth merely from the strength of his own free-will
   yielding obedience to God's gracious invitation, which, like the other,
   he might have rejected: this is the immediate cause of his conversion,
   to which all the praise thereof is due." And here the old idol may
   glory to all the world, that if he can but get his worshippers to
   prevail in this, he hath quite excluded the grace of Christ, and made
   it "nomen inane," a mere title, whereas there is no such thing in the
   world.

   Thirdly, They teach, that notwithstanding any purpose and intention of
   God to convert, and so to save, a sinner, -- notwithstanding the most
   powerful and effectual operation of the blessed Spirit, with the most
   winning, persuasive preaching of the word, -- yet it is in the power of
   a man to frustrate that purpose, resist that operation, and reject that
   preaching of the gospel. I shall not need to prove this, for it is that
   which, in direct terms, they plead for; which also they must do, if
   they will comply with their former principles. For granting all these
   to have no influence upon any man but by the way of moral persuasion,
   we must not only grant that it may be resisted, but also utterly deny
   that it can be obeyed. We may resist it, I say, as having both a
   disability to good and repugnancy against it; but for obeying it,
   unless we will deny all inherent corruption and depravation of nature,
   we cannot attribute any such sufficiency unto ourselves.

   Now, concerning this weakness of grace, that it is not able to overcome
   the opposing power of sinful nature, one testimony of Arminius shall
   suffice: [235] "It always remaineth in the power of free-will to reject
   grace that is given and to refuse that which followeth; for grace is no
   almighty action of God, to which free-will cannot resist." Not that I
   would assert, in opposition to this, such an operation of grace as
   should, as it were, violently overcome the will of man, and force him
   to obedience, which must needs be prejudicial unto our liberty; but
   only consisting in such a sweet effectual working as doth infallibly
   promote our conversion, make us willing who before were unwilling, and
   obedient who were not obedient, that createth clean hearts and reneweth
   right spirits within us.

   That, then, which we assert, in opposition to these Arminian
   heterodoxies, is, That the effectual grace which God useth in the great
   work of our conversion, by reason of its own nature, -- being also the
   instrument of and God's intention for that purpose, -- doth surely
   produce the effect intended, without successful resistance, and solely,
   without any considerable co-operation of our own wills, until they are
   prepared and changed by that very grace. The infallibility of its
   effect depends chiefly on the purpose of God. When by any means he
   intends a man's conversion, those means must have such an efficacy
   added unto them as may make them fit instruments for the accomplishment
   of that intention, that the counsel of the Lord may prosper, and his
   word not return empty. But the manner of its operation, -- that it
   requires no human assistance, and is able to overcome all repugnance,
   -- is proper to the being of such an act as wherein it doth consist.
   Which nature and efficacy of grace, in opposition to an indifferent
   influence of the Holy Spirit, a metaphorical motion, a working by the
   way of moral persuasion, only proposing a desirable object, easy to be
   resisted, and not effectual unless it be helped by an inbred ability of
   our own (which is the Arminian grace), I will briefly confirm, having
   premised these few things:--

   First, Although God doth not use the wills of men, in their conversion,
   as malign spirits use the members of men in enthusiasms, by a violent
   wrested motion, but sweetly and agreeably to their own free nature; yet
   in the first act of our conversion the will is merely passive, as a
   capable subject of such a work, not at all concurring cooperatively to
   our turning. It is not, I say, the cause of the work, but the subject
   wherein it is wrought, having only a passive capability for the
   receiving of that supernatural being, which is introduced by grace. The
   beginning of this "good work" is merely from God, Phil. i. 6. Yea,
   faith is ascribed unto grace, not by the way of conjunction with, but
   of opposition unto, our wills: "Not of ourselves; it is the gift of
   God," Eph. ii. 8. "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves; our
   sufficiency is of God," 2 Cor. iii. 5. "Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,
   and we shall be turned," Lam. v. 21.

   Secondly, Though the will of man conferreth nothing to the infusion of
   the first grace, but a subjective receiving of it, yet in the very
   first act that is wrought in and by the will, it most freely
   cooperateth (by the way of subordination) with the grace of God; and
   the more effectually it is moved by grace, the more freely it worketh
   with it. Man being converted, converteth himself.

   Thirdly, We do not affirm grace to be irresistible, as though it came
   upon the will with such an overflowing violence as to beat it down
   before it, and subdue it by compulsion to what it is no way inclinable
   [unto.] But if that term must be used, it denoteth, in our sense, only
   such an unconquerable efficacy of grace as always and infallibly
   produceth its effect; for who is it that can "withstand God?" Acts xi.
   17. As also, it may be used on the part of the will itself, which will
   not resist it: "All that the Father giveth unto Christ shall come to
   him," John vi. 37. The operation of grace is resisted by no hard heart;
   because it mollifies the heart itself. It doth not so much take away a
   power of resisting as give a will of obeying, whereby the powerful
   impotency of resistance is removed.

   Fourthly, Concerning grace itself, it is either common or special.
   Common or general grace consisteth in the external revelation of the
   will of God by his word, with some illumination of the mind to perceive
   it, and correction of the affections not too much to contemn it; and
   this, in some degree or other, to some more, to some less, is common to
   all that are called. Special grace is the grace of regeneration,
   comprehending the former, adding more spiritual acts, but especially
   presupposing the purpose of God, on which its efficacy doth chiefly
   depend.

   Fifthly, This saving grace, whereby the Lord converteth or regenerateth
   a sinner, translating him from death to life, is either external or
   internal. External consisteth in the preaching of the word, etc., whose
   operation is by the way of moral persuasion, when by it we beseech our
   hearers "in Christ's stead that they would be reconciled unto God," 2
   Cor. v. 20; and this in our conversion is the instrumental organ
   thereof, and may be said to be a sufficient cause of our regeneration,
   inasmuch as no other in the same kind is necessary. It may also be
   resisted in sensu diviso, abstracting from that consideration wherein
   it is looked on as the instrument of God for such an end.

   Sixthly, Internal grace is by divines distinguished into the first or
   preventing grace, and the second following cooperating grace. The first
   is that spiritual vital principle that is infused into us by the Holy
   Spirit, that new creation and bestowing of new strength, whereby we are
   made fit and able for the producing of spiritual acts, to believe and
   yield evangelical obedience: "For we are the workmanship of God,
   created in Christ Jesus unto good works," Eph. ii. 10. By this God
   "gives us a new heart, and a new spirit he puts within us;" he "takes
   the stony heart out of our flesh, and gives us an heart of flesh;" he
   "puts his Spirit within us, to cause us to walk in his statutes," Ezek.
   xxxvi. 26, 27.

   Now, this first grace is not properly and formally a vital act, but
   causaliter only, in being a principle moving to such vital acts within
   us. It is the habit of faith bestowed upon a man, that he may be able
   to eliciate and perform the acts thereof, giving new light to the
   understanding, new inclinations to the will, and new affections unto
   the heart: for the infallible efficacy of which grace it is that we
   plead against the Arminians. And amongst those innumerable places of
   holy Scripture confirming this truth, I shall make use only of a very
   few, reduced to these three heads:--

   First, Our conversion is wrought by a divine, almighty action, which
   the will of man will not, and therefore cannot resist. The impotency
   thereof ought not to be opposed to this omnipotent grace, which will
   certainly effect the work for which it is ordained, being an action not
   inferior to the greatness of his "mighty power, which he wrought in
   Christ when he raised him from the dead," Eph. i. 19, 20. And shall not
   that power which could overcome hell, and loose the bonds of death, be
   effectual for the raising of a sinner from the death of sin, when by
   God's intention it is appointed unto that work? He accomplisheth "the
   work of faith with power," 2 Thess. i. 11. It is "his divine power that
   giveth unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness," 2 Pet.
   i. 3. Surely a moral, resistible persuasion would not be thus often
   termed the "power" of God, which denoteth an actual efficacy to which
   no creature is able to resist.

   Secondly, That which consisteth in a real efficiency, and is not at all
   but when and where it actually worketh what it intendeth, cannot
   without a contradiction be said to be so resisted that it should not
   work, the whole nature thereof consisting in such a real operation.
   Now, that the very essence of divine grace consisteth in such a formal
   act may be proved by all those places of Scripture that affirm God by
   his grace, or the grace of God, actually to accomplish our conversion:
   as Deut. xxx. 6, "And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and
   the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
   and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live." The circumcision of our
   hearts, that we may love the Lord with all our hearts, and with all our
   souls, is our conversion, which the Lord affirmeth here that he himself
   will do; not only enable us to do it, but he himself really and
   effectually will accomplish it. And again, "I will put my law in their
   inward parts, and write it in their hearts," Jer. xxxi. 33. "I will put
   my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me," chap.
   xxxii. 40. He will not offer his fear unto them, but actually put it
   into them. And most clearly, Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27: "A new heart also
   will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will
   take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an
   heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to
   walk in my statutes." Are these expressions of a moral persuasion only?
   Doth God affirm here he will do what he intends only to persuade us to,
   and which we may refuse to do if we will? Is it in the power of a stony
   heart to remove itself? What an active stone is this, in mounting
   upwards! What doth it at all differ from that heart of flesh that God
   promiseth? Shall a stony heart be said to have a power to change itself
   into such a heart of flesh as shall cause us to walk in God's statutes?
   Surely, unless men were wilfully blind, they must needs here perceive
   such an action of God denoted, as effectually, solely, and infallibly
   worketh our conversion; "opening our hearts, that we may attend unto
   the word," Acts xvi. 14; "giving us in the behalf of Christ to believe
   on him," Phil. i. 29. Now, these and the like places prove both the
   nature of God's grace to consist in a real efficiency, and the
   operation thereof to be certainly effectual.

   Thirdly, Our conversion is a "new creation," a "resurrection," a "new
   birth." Now, he that createth a man doth not persuade him to create
   himself, neither can he if he should, nor hath he any power to resist
   him that will create him, -- that is, as we now take it, translate him
   from something that he is to what he is not. What arguments do you
   think were sufficient to persuade a dead man to rise? or what great aid
   can he contribute to his own resurrection? Neither doth a man beget
   himself; a new real form was never yet introduced into any matter by
   subtle arguments. These are the terms the Scripture is pleased to use
   concerning our conversion:-- "If any man be in Christ, he is a new
   creature," 2 Cor. v. 17. The "new man after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness," Eph. iv. 24. It is our new birth:
   "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God," John
   iii. 3. "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth," James i.
   18. And so we become "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,"
   1 Pet. i. 23. It is our vivification and resurrection: "The Son
   quickeneth whom he will," John v. 21, even those "dead," who "hear his
   voice and live," verse 25. "When we were dead in sins," we are
   "quickened together with Christ by grace," Eph. ii. 5; for "being
   buried with him by baptism, we are also risen with him through the
   faith of the operation of God," Col. ii. 12. And "blessed and holy is
   he that hath part in that first resurrection; on such the second death
   hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and
   shall reign with him a thousand years."

       blasphemantem in episcopum, ex cujus ore, dominus universæ Africæ,
       unitatis indulserit felicitatem, non solum a conventu illo, sed ab
       omni ecclesia pellendum.: [1290]1
     * Dominus dissipavit consilium quod dederat Achitophel agendo in
       corde Absolon, ut tale consilium repudiaret, et aliud quod ei non
       expediebat eligeret.: [1291]1
     * Dum multum sudant nonnulli, quomodo Platonem faciant Christianum,
       se probant esse ethnicos.: [1292]1
     * Ea quæ de habituum infusione dicuntur, ante omnem fidei actum,
       rejiciuntur a nobis.: [1293]1
     * Ea sententia non continet apostoli verba, sed Judæorum objectionem
       ab apostolo rejectam.: [1294]1
     * Ecclesiæ tanquam sacrosancta doctrina obtruditur, Deum
       absolutissimo et immutabili decreto ab omni retro æternitate, pro
       puro suo beneplacito, singulares quosdam homines, eosque, quoad

       tanquam de meo gloriari? Quod enim potui Dei miserentis est, quod
       autem volui cum possem nolle, id meæ potestatis est.: [1296]1
     * Electio alia completa est, quæ neminem spectat nisi immorientem.
       Electio peremptoria totum salutis complementum et consummationem
       decernit, ideoque in objecto requirit totam consummatam fidei
       obedientiam.: [1297]1
     * Electio alia completa est, quæ neminem spectat nisi morientem, alia
       incompleta, quæ omnibus fidelibus communis est; ut salutis bona
       sunt incompleta quæ continuantur, fide continuatâ, et abnegatâ,
       revocantur, sic electio est incompleta in hac vita, non
       peremptoria, revocabilis.: [1298]1
     * Electio non est ab æterno.: [1299]1
     * Electio sicut et justificatio, et incerta et revocabilis, utramque
       vero conditionatam qui negaverit, ipsum quoque evangelium negabit.:
       [1300]1
     * Electionis et reprobationis causa unica vera et absoluta non est
       Dei voluntas, sed respectus obedientiæ et inobedientiæ.: [1301]1

     * Et hoc clarum est in præceptis divinis: [1305]1
     * Ex ratione creationis homo habebat affectum ad ea quæ vetabantur.:

       quatenus Deus posteros Adami eidem malo, cui Adamus per peccatum
       obnoxium se reddidit, obnoxios nasci voluit; sive quatenus Deus,
       malum, quod Adamo inflictum erat in poenam, in posteros ejus
       dimanare et transire permisit.: [1309]1
     * Fatemur, aliam nobis ad actum fidei eliciendum necessariam gratiam
       non agnosci quam moralem.: [1310]1
     * Fides et conversio non possunt esse obedientia, si tantum ab
       aliquo, in alio, efficiantur.: [1311]1

     * Gentes sub Veteri Testamento viventes licet ipsis ista ratione qua
       Judæis non fuit revelatum, non tamen inde continuo ex fædere
       absolute exclusæ sunt, nec a salute præcise exclusi judicari
       debent, quia aliquo saltem modo vocantur.: [1315]1
     * His gradibus itur in coelum.: [1316]1
     * His ita expositis ex mente Augustini,: [1317]1
     * Homo non est idoneus cui lex feratur, quando in eo, ad id quod lege
       vetatur, non est propensio, ac inclinatio naturalis.: [1318]1
     * Homo non libertate gratiam, sed gratia libertatem, assequitur.:
       [1319]1
     * Hunc populus fecit: [1320]1
     * Illi, in quorum gratiam, Dominus Paulum in Corinthum misit,
       dicuntur Dei populus, quia Deum turn timebant, eique, secundum
       cognitionem quam de eo habebant, serviebant ex animo, et sic ad
       prædicationem Pauli,: [1321]1
     * Illud certissimum est, nec jubendum esse quod efficitur, nec
       efiiciendum quod jubetur. Stulte jubet et vult ab alio fieri
       aliquid, qui ipse quod jubet in eo efficere vult.: [1322]1
     * Imbecillitas membrorum infantilium innocens est, non animus.:
       [1323]1
     * Immediata morris Christi effectio, ac passionis, illa est non
       actualis peccatorum ab his aut illis ablatio, non actualis
       remissio, non justificatio, non actualis horum aut illorum
       redemptio.: [1324]1
     * Imo noverunt, non solum Romanam Africanamque ecclesiam, sed per
       omnes mundi partes, universæ promissionis filios, cum doctrina
       hujus viri, sicut in tota fide, ita in gratiæ confessione
       congruere.: [1325]1
     * Imo ut confidentius agum, dico effectum gratiæ, ordinaria lege,
       pendere ab actu aliquo arbitrii.: [1326]1
     * Impetratio salutis pro omnibus, est acquisitio possibilitatis, ut
       nimirum Deus, illæsa sua justitia, hominem peccatorem possit
       recipere in gratiam.: [1327]1
     * In arbitrio creaturæ semper est vel influere in actum vel influxum
       suum suspendere, et vel sic, vel aliter influere.: [1328]1
     * In eo differt præscientia intuitionis, ab ea, quæ approbationis

       homo bona, quæ non Deus præstet ut faciat.: [1352]1
     * Multa non fieri quæ Deus fieri vult, vel non dubitamus.: [1353]1
     * Multa tamen arbitror Deum velle, quæ non vellet, adeoque nec juste
       velle posset, nisi aliqua actio creaturæ præcederet.: [1354]1
     * Multi voluntatem Dei faciunt, cum illam nituntur vitare, et
       resistendo imprudenter obsequuntur divino consilio.: [1355]1
     * Natura sic apparet vitiata ut hoc majoris vitii sit, non videre.:

       Christo per veram fidem sit insitus.: [1360]1
     * Nihil ineptius, nihil vanius, quam regenerationem et fidem merito

       alioqui inefficacem, efficacem reddimus; sane, fieri aliter non
       potest.: [1433]1
     * Sic scholastici omnes.: [1434]1
     * Sicut: [1435]1
     * Talis gratia omnibus datur quæ sufficiat ad fidem generandam.:
       [1436]1
     * Tantæ molis erat.: [1437]1
     * Tanta est erga homines bonitas Dei, ut nostra velit esse merita quæ
       sunt ipsius dona.: [1438]1
     * Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum!: [1439]1
     * Tenendum est, veram conversionem præstationemque bonorum operum
       esse conditionem prærequisitam ante justificationem.: [1440]1
     * Tres sunt ordines credentium et resipiscentium in Scripturis,
       novitii, credentes aliquandiu, perseverantes. Duo priores ordines
       credentium eliguntur vere quidem, at non prorsus absolute, nec nisi
       ad tempus, puta quamdiu et quatenus tales sunt,: [1441]1
     * Unumquodque quod est, dum est, necesse est, ut sit.: [1442]1
     * Ut autem assensus hic eliciatur in nobis, duo in primis necessaria
       sunt:-- 1. Argumenta talia ex parte Dei, quibus nihil verisimiliter
       opponi potest cur credibilia non sint. 2. Pia docilitas animique
       probitas.: [1443]1
     * Ut gratia sit efficax in actu secundo pendet a libera voluntate.:
       [1444]1
     * Vehemens est in Deo affectus ad homini benefaciendum.: [1445]1
     * Verissimum est Arminium docere, perverse dici peccatum originis
       reum facere mortis.: [1446]1
     * Vid.: [1447]1 [1448]2 [1449]3 [1450]4
     * Vid. plura.: [1451]1
     * Vidi ego zelantem parvulum qui nondum loquebatur, et intuebatur
       pallidus, amaro aspectu colluctaneum suum.: [1452]1
     * Virtutem autem nemo unquam acceptam deo retulit. Nimirum rectè:
       propter virtutem enim jure laudamur, et in virtute rectè gloriamur.
       Quod non contingeret, si id donum à Deo, non à nobis haberemus.:
       [1453]1
     * Volitiones aliquæ Dei cessant certo quodam tempore.: [1454]1
     * Voluntatem comitatur proprietas quædam inseparabilis, quam
       libertatem vocamus; a qua voluntas dicitur potentia, quæ positis
       omnibus prærequisitis ad agendum necessariis, potest velle et
       nolle, aut velle et non velle.: [1455]1
