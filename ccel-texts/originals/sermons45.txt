Comfort for the Tempted

   (No. 2603)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 1, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 27, 1883.

   "There hats no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
   God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you
   are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape,
   that you may be able to bear it" 1 Corinthians 10:13.

   THE children of God are all subject to temptation--some of them are
   tempted more than others, but I an persuaded that there is not one,
   except those who are too young to be conscious of evil, who will enter
   Heaven without having endured some temptation. If anyone could have
   escaped, surely it would have been "the First-Born among many
   brethren," but you will remember how He was led of the Spirit, straight
   from the waters of His Baptism, into the wilderness to be tempted of
   the devil. And the Apostle Paul informs us that He "was in all points
   tempted like as we are, yet without sin." Truly, the Lord Jesus might
   say to us who are His followers, "If I, your Master and Lord, have been
   tempted, you must not expect to escape temptation, for the disciple is
   not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord."

   The fact that we are tempted ought to humble us, for it is sad evidence
   that there is sin still remaining in us. I am old enough to remember
   the times when we used to strike with a flint upon the steel in order
   to get a light in the morning, and I recollect that I always left off
   trying to produce a spark when I found that there was no tinder in the
   box. I believe that the devil is no fool and that if there is a man who
   has no tinder in the box--that is, no corruption in his nature-- depend
   upon it, Satan will not long continue to tempt him! He does not waste
   his time in such a useless exercise. The man who believes that he is
   perfect can never pray the Lord's Prayer--he must offer one of his own
   making, for he will never be willing to say, "Lead us not into
   temptation." But, Beloved, because the devil thinks it worth his while
   to tempt us, we may conclude that there is something in us that is
   temptable--that sin still dwells there, notwithstanding that the Grace
   of God has renewed our hearts.

   The fact that we are tempted ought also to remind us of our weakness. I
   referred just now to the model prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
   contains the sentence, "Lead us not into temptation." The reason for
   presenting that petition must be because we are so weak and frail. We
   ask that we may not be burdened, for our back is not strong, and we
   plead that we may not have sin put before us in any of its enticing
   forms, for, oftentimes, the flesh borrows strength from the world and
   even from the devil! And these allied powers will be too much for us
   unless the Omnipotence of God shall be exerted on our behalf to hold us
   up lest we fall.

   Some children of God, whom I know of, are very greatly troubled because
   they are tempted. They think they could bear trial if it were trial
   dissociated from sin, though I do not see how we can, as a general
   rule, separate trial from temptation, for every trial that comes to us
   has in it some kind of temptation or other, either to unbelief, or to
   murmuring, or to the use of wrong means to escape from the trial. We
   are tempted by our mercies and we are tempted by our miseries-- that
   is, tempted in the sense of being tried by them--but, to the child of
   God, the most grievous thing is that, sometimes, he is tempted to do or
   say things which he utterly hates. He has set before him, in a pleasant
   aspect, sins which are perfectly abhorrent to him. He cannot bear the
   very name of them! Yet Satan comes and holds before the child of God
   the unclean meats which he will never touch. And I have known the devil
   to tempt the people of God by injecting into their mind blasphemous
   thoughts, hurling them into their ears as with a hurricane. Yes, even
   when you are in prayer it may happen to you that thoughts the very
   opposite of devotional, will come flocking into your brain. A little
   noise in the street will draw you off from communion with God and,
   almost before you are aware of it, your thoughts, like wild horses,
   will have gone galloping over hill and dale--and you hardly know how
   you shall ever catch them.

   Now, such temptations as these are dreadfully painful to a child of
   God. He cannot bear the poisoned breath of sin and when he finds that
   sin stands knocking at his door, shouting under his window, pestering
   him day and night, as it has occurred with some--I hope not with
   many--then he is sorely beset and is grievously troubled. It may help
   such a person if I remind him that there is no sin in being tempted.
   The sin is that of the tempter, not of the tempted. If you resist the
   temptation, there is something praiseworthy about your action. There is
   nothing praiseworthy about the temptation--that is evil and only evil,
   but you did not tempt yourself--he or she that tempted you must bear
   the blame of the temptation. You are evidently not blameworthy for
   thoughts that grieve you--they may prove that there is sin still
   remaining in you, but there is no sin in your being tempted. The sin is
   in your yieldingto the temptation, but blessed shall you be if you can
   stand up against it. If you can overcome it, if your spirit does not
   yield to it, you shall even be blessed through it! "Blessed is the man
   that endures temptation." There is a blessedness even in the temptation
   and though for the present it seems not to be joyous, but grievous,
   nevertheless, afterward, it yields blessed fruit to those who are
   exercised thereby.

   Moreover, there are worse things in this world than being tempted with
   painful temptations. It is much worse to be tempted with a pleasant
   temptation--to be gently sucked down into the destroyer's mouth--to be
   carried along the smooth current, afterwards to be hurled over the
   cataract. This is dreadful, but to fight against temptation--this is
   good. I say again that there are many worse things than to be tried
   with a temptation that arouses all the indignation of your spirit. An
   old divine used to say that he was more afraid of a sleeping devil than
   he was of a roaring one, and there is much truth in that observation,
   for, when you are left quite alone and no temptation assails you, you
   are apt to get carnally secure and to boastfully say, "I shall never be
   moved." I think no man is in such imminent danger as the man who thinks
   that there is no danger likely to befall him, so that anything that
   keeps us on the watchtower, even though it is, in itself, evil, is, so
   far, overruled for good. The most dangerous part of the road to Heaven
   is not the Valley of the Shadow of Death--we do not find that Christian
   went to sleep there when the hobgoblins were all about him and when he
   found it hard to feel the path and stay on it--but when he and Hopeful
   came to the Enchanted Ground, "whose air naturally tended to make one
   drowsy." Then were the pilgrims in great peril until Christian reminded
   his fellow traveler that they were warned by the shepherds not to sleep
   when they came to that treacherous part of the way.

   I think, then, that to be tempted with painful temptations--those that
   goad the spirit almost to madness. Bad as that trial is--grievous as it
   is to be borne--may be, spiritually, not the worst thing that can
   possibly happen to us. Of all evils that beset you, always choose that
   which is less than another and, as this is less than something else
   might be, do not be utterly driven to despair if it falls to your lot
   to be tempted as many before you have been.

   This will suffice by way of preface to a little talk about temptation
   with a view of comforting any who are sorely tempted of Satan. I know
   that I am speaking to many such and I would repeat to them the words of
   my text--"There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to
   man: but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond
   what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of
   escape, that you may be able to bear it." Remember, dear tried Friend,
   that you must not sit down in despair and say, "I am greatly tempted,
   now, and I am afraid that I shall be tempted worse and worse until my
   feet shall slide, and I shall fall and utterly perish." Do not say as
   David did when he had been hunted like a partridge upon the mountains,
   "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul," but believe that the
   Lord, who permitsyou to be tempted, will deliver you in His own good
   time!

   I. Here is your first comfort. THERE HAS BEEN A LIMIT IN ALL YOUR
   FORMER TRIALS. "There has no temptation taken you but such as is common
   to man."

   Temptation has sometimes laid hold of you, like a murderer takes a man
   by the throat, all of a sudden. It has seized you--perhaps that is as
   correct a word as I can use--temptation has seized you, unawares,
   pinioned you and seemed to grip you tightly. And yet, up till now, the
   temptations you have had to endure have only been such as are common to
   man!

   First, they are such as have been endured by your fellow Christians. I
   know that you are tempted to think that you are a lone traveler on a
   road that nobody has ever traversed before you, but if you carefully
   examine the track, you can discover the footprints of some of the best
   of God's servants who have passed along that wearisome way. It is a
   very dark lane, you say--one that might truly be called, "Cut-Throat
   Lane." Ah, but you will find that Apostles have been along that way,
   confessors have been that way, martyrs have been that way--and the best
   of God's saints have been tempted just as you now are. "Oh, but," says
   one, "I am tempted, as you said a little while ago, with blasphemous
   and horrible thoughts." So was Master John Bunyan. Read his Grace
   Abounding to the Chief of Sinners and see what he had to pass through.
   Many others have had a similar experience and among them are some of us
   who are alive to tell you that we know all about this special form of
   temptation, yet the Lord delivered us out of it.

   "Oh, but," says another tried soul, "I have been even tempted to
   self-destruction!" That, also, has not been an unusual temptation, even
   to God's dearest saints and, though He has preserved them and kept them
   alive, yet they have often felt like Job when he said, "My soul chooses
   strangling and death rather than my life." "Ah," cries another, "I am
   tempted to the very worst sins, the foulest sins. I would not dare to
   even mention to you the abominations Satan tempts me to commit!" You
   need not tell me and I trust that you will be kept from them by the
   almighty power of God's Holy Spirit, but I can assure you that even the
   saints in Heaven, if they could speak to you at this moment, would tell
   you that some of them were hard beset--even some of the bravest of them
   who walked nearest to God were hard beset by temptations which they
   would not have told to their fellow men, so troubled were they by them.
   Perhaps yet another friend says, "I have been actually tempted to
   self-righteousness, which is as great a temptation as can befall a man
   whose whole confidence is in Christ." Well, so was Master John Knox,
   that grand preacher of justification by faith. When he lay dying, he
   was tempted to glory in his own bravery for Christ--but he fought
   against that evil thought and overcame it-- and so may you!

   You think that when a man is very patient, he is not tempted to
   impatience? Brother, the Spirit of God says, by the pen of the Apostle
   James, "You have heard of the patience of Job." I suggest to you this
   question--Have you not heard of the impatienceof Job? You have heard,
   no doubt, of the strong faith of Peter. Have you never heard of Peter's
   unbelief? God's people usually fail in the very point for which they
   are most famous--and the man who has the greatest renown for any work
   of the Spirit of God in him, so far as the Bible biographies are
   concerned, has usually been the man who has made a failure at just the
   place where he thought he was strongest! "I have been reading the life
   of a good man," you say, "and I am not like he." Shall I tell you why?
   Because the whole of his life was not written! But when the Holy Spirit
   writes a man's life, He tells it all. When biographers write the lives
   of good men, of course they do not put down their inward struggles and
   fears, unless the subject happens to be a man like Martin Luther, whose
   life seemed to be all an inward struggle and who, while he was brave on
   the outside, was often a trembler within! When they write my life, they
   will tell you that I had strong faith, but they will not tell you all
   about the other side of it. And then you will, perhaps, get to
   thinking, "Oh, I cannot reach even to such a height as Mr. Spurgeon
   attained!" That all comes of your not knowing the inside of us, for if
   you knew the inside and the outside of the man who walks nearest to
   God--if he is a sincere, true-hearted man, he will tell you that the
   temptations you have to endure are just such temptations as he has had
   and, as he expects to have again and again and that, as the Apostle
   says, "there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man."

   Then, again, no temptation has assailed you but such as fit for men to
   be tried with while they are in this state of trial This is not the
   time for the final victory, Brothers and Sisters, this is the hour of
   battle! And the weapons that are used against us are only such as have
   been employed against the armies of the faithful in all ages. You and I
   never were tempted as were the angels who kept their first estate and
   overcame the temptation. I cannot tell you how the Prince of Darkness
   was tempted, or how he went about tempting his fellow servants from
   their loyalty to the great King. But of this I am sure--you were never
   tried with a temptation suitable to an angel! Your temptation has only
   been such as is suitable to a man, and which as other men, like
   yourself, have overcome. Others have fought valiantly against similar
   temptations as yours and you must do the same, yes, and you shall do
   the same by the power of God's Spirit resting upon you!

   It is said, in the affairs of common life, that what man has done, man
   can do, and that is true with regard to the spiritual life. Temptations
   that have been grappled with by other men, can be grappled with by you
   if you seek the same source of strength and seek it in the same name as
   they did. The strength to overcome temptation comes from God, alone,
   and the conquering name is the name of Jesus Christ! Therefore, go
   forward in that strength and in that name against all your temptations.
   Up and at them, for they have been routed long before, and you shall
   rout them again! Tremble not to go from fight to fight and from victory
   to victory, even as did the others who have gone before you and who
   have now entered into their rest--

   "Once they were mourning here below, And wet their couch with tears.
   They wrestled hard, as we do now, With sins, and doubts, and fears."

   If you ask them from where their victory came, they ascribe it to the
   resources which are as open to you as they were to them--even to the
   mighty working of God the Holy Spirit and the blood and righteousness
   of the Lord Jesus Christ! There has no temptation happened to you but
   such as human beings can grapple with and overcome by the help of God!

   Again, there has no temptation ever happened to you but such as is
   common to man in this sense--that Christ has endured it. That great
   Head of manhood, that representative Man has suffered from the very
   temptation which is now pestering you. "In all their affliction--that
   is, the affliction of His people in the wilderness, which is just the
   same as yours if you are in the wilderness--"in all their affliction He
   was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them." He was
   compassed with infirmity, "a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief."
   To repeat the text I have already quoted, and which is so suitable
   here, He "was, in all points, tempted like as we are." "In all things
   it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a
   merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make
   reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He, Himself, has
   suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted." He
   knows all about the case of each one of us and He knows how to deal
   with it, and how to bear us up and bear us through.

   So you see, dear Friends, there has no temptation happened to you but
   such as is common to man in the sense of having been endured by men
   like yourselves, having been overcome by men such as you are and having
   been endured and vanquished by your blessed Representative, our Lord
   and Savior Jesus Christ.

   Come, then, Beloved, let all mystery with regard to your temptations be
   banished! Mystery puts an edge upon the sword of trial. Perhaps the
   hand that wrote upon the wall would not have frightened Belshazzar if
   he could have seen the body to which that hand belonged. There is no
   mystery, after all, about your trouble! Though you did write it down as
   being bigger than any that ever happened to a human being, that is not
   the truth--you are not an emperor in the realm of misery! You cannot
   truly say, "I am the man that has seen affliction above all others,"
   for your Lord endured far more than you have ever done--and many of His
   saints, who passed from the stake to the crown, must have suffered much
   more than you have been called to undergo thus far.

   II. Now let us turn to the second comfort revealed in our text. That
   is, THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD--"There has no temptation taken you but
   such as is common to man: but God is faithful."

   Oh, what a blessed word is this, "God is faithful"! Therefore, He is
   true to His promise. Even Balaam said, "God is not a man, that He
   should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent: has He said,
   and shall He not do it ? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it
   good?" One of God's promises is, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you." "God is faithful," so He will fulfill that promise! Here is one
   of the promises of Christ, and Christ is God--"My sheep hear My voice,
   and I know them, and they follow Me: and I give unto them eternal life;
   and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My
   hand." "God is faithful," so that promise shall be fulfilled! You have
   often heard this promise, "As your days, so shall your strength be." Do
   you believe it, or will you make God a liar? If you believe it, then
   banish from your mind all dark forebodings with this blessed little
   sentence, "God is faithful."

   Notice, next, that not only is God faithful, but He is master of the
   situation, so that He can keep His promise. Note what the text says.
   "Who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what you are able to
   bear." Then you could not have been tempted if God had not allowed it
   to happen to you. God is far mightier than Satan. The devil could not
   touch Job except by Divine permission, neither can he try and tempt you
   except as God allows him. He must have a permit from the King of Kings
   before he can tempt a single saint! Why, Satan is not allowed to keep
   the key of his own house, for the keys of death and of Hell hang at the
   belt of Christ! And without God's permission, the dog of Hell cannot
   even open his mouth to bark at a child of God, much less can he come
   and worry any of the sheep whom the Lord has called by His Grace into
   His fold! So, then, Beloved, you have great cause for comfort from the
   fact that the temptation that tries you is still under the control of
   the faithful Creator, "who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond
   what you are able."

   That is a second reason for comfort--roll it under your tongue as a
   sweet morsel.

   III. The third comfort lies in THE RESTRAINT WHICH GOD PUTS UPON
   TEMPTATION. He "will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what you are
   able." The tide of trial shall rise to high-water mark and then God
   shall say, "Hitherto shall you come, but no further: and here shall
   your proud waves be stayed."

   He "will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what you are able." That
   may apply, sometimes, to the period when the temptation comes. I have
   carefully watched how God times the trials of His people. If
   such-and-such a trial had come to one of His children when he was
   young, I believe he could not have borne it. Or if he had lost some
   dear friend while he was, himself, sick, the double trouble would have
   crushed him. But God sends our trials at the right time and if He puts
   an extra burden on in one way, He takes something off in another. "He
   stays His rough wind in the day of the East wind." It is a very simple
   thing to say, but it is true--if the wind blows from the North, it does
   not, at the same time, blow from the South. And if one set of troubles
   comes to a Christian, another set of troubles generally departs from
   him. John Bradford, the famous martyr, was often subject to rheumatism
   and depression of spirit--in which I can greatly sympathize with
   him--but when he was laid by the heels in a foul damp dungeon and knew
   that he would never come out except to die, he wrote, "It is an amazing
   thing that ever since I have been in this prison and have had other
   trials to bear, I have had no touch of my rheumatism or my depression
   of spirit." Was not that a very blessed thing? And you will usually
   find that it is so--you shall not be tempted above what you are able to
   bear because God will permit the trial to come at a time when you are
   best able to stand up under it.

   There is also great kindness on God's part in the continuance of a
   trial. If some of our trials lasted much longer, they would be too
   heavy for us to bear. Concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, our Lord
   said, "Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be
   saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." And I
   have no doubt that, oftentimes, God makes quick work of His children's
   trials because if they were continued longer, they would have not a
   good, but an evil effect upon us. If a child must be whipped, let not
   the punishment last as if he were a criminal who must be sentenced for
   a long period--let him have his chastisement and have done with it. So
   is it often in the discipline of God's house, yet there are other
   trials which are protracted year after year because trial is an
   ingredient in their efficacy and they might not be blessed to us if
   they were shortened. In every case there is Infinite Wisdom which makes
   our troubles to be just as long as they are and no longer.

   So there is in the number of the trials. Blessed be God--

   "If He ordains the number ten, They never can be eleven."

   If He intends His servants to pass through the fire and not through the
   water, Satan himself cannot make them go through the water! God counts
   the drops of bitter tonic that He administers to His ailing saints and
   not one drop more shall they possibly have than He measures out to
   them. So, dear tried children of God, you shall not be tempted above
   what you are able so far as the number of your temptations and trials
   is concerned.

   It is the same, also, in the stress with which the temptation comes.
   Have you ever seen a great tree in the full blast of a tremendous
   tempest? It sways to and fro and seems scarcely able to recover itself
   from the powerful blows of the storm, yet the roots hold it. But now
   comes another tornado and it seems as if the tree must be torn up out
   of the earth, but the strain ceases just in time for the old oak to
   rock back into its place, again. But if there were a pound or two more
   force in that tremendous blast, the tree would be laid prone upon the
   grass! But God, in His people's case, at any rate, stops just at the
   right point. You may be tried till you have not an ounce of strength
   left. Sometimes, the Lord tests His people till it seems as if one more
   breath from Him would assuredly cause them to sink. Then it is that He
   puts under them the everlasting arms and no further trial is laid upon
   them. This is a blessed thing, for all of you have troubles of one sort
   or another, and you who are the people of God may take this text and
   rely implicitly upon it--"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to
   be tempted beyond what you are able."

   As for you who are not His people, I am very sorry for you. I am
   holding up these precious things, but they are not for you. God's Word
   declares, "Many sorrows shall be to the wicked." If you have not God to
   flee to, what will you do when the storms beat upon your boat? To whom
   or where can you flee? As for the Christian, he can sing--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul,

   Let me to Your bosom fly,

   While the nearer waters roll,

   While the tempest still is high!

   Hide me, O my Savior, hide, Till the storm of life is past Safe into
   the haven guide. Oh receive my soul at last!

   But, poor dear souls who love not Christ, where can you find comfort in
   your seasons of sorrow and trial? You who have lost wife and
   children--you who are pinched with poverty--you who are racked with
   sickness and yet have no Savior, what can you do? Poor houseless people
   in a snowstorm--what can they do without even a bush to shelter them?
   That is your state and I grieve for you, and plead with you not to
   remain in such a pitiful condition a moment longer!--

   "Come, guilty souls, and flee away

   Like doves to Jesus' wounds.

   This is the welcome Gospel-day,

   Wherein free Grace abounds!

   Oh, that your sense of need might drive you to accept Christ as your
   Savior this very hour! As for His believing people, there is this solid
   comfort for them--they shall never be tempted above what they are able.

   IV. The next comfort we gather from our text relates to THE PROVISION
   WHICH THE LORD MAKES FOR THE TEMPTED "God is faithful, who...will with
   the temptation also make a way to escape."

   The Greek has it, "who will with the temptation also make the way to
   escape," for there is a proper way to escape from a temptation. There
   are 20 improper ways and woe to the man who makes use of any of them!
   But there is only one proper way out of a trial and that is the
   straight way, the way that God has made for His people to travel. God
   has made through all trials the way by which His servants may rightly
   come out of them. When the brave young Jews were tried by
   Nebuchadnezzar, there was one way by which they might have kept out of
   the burning fiery furnace. They had only to bow their knees before the
   great image when the flute, harp, sackbut and psaltery sounded. That
   way of escape would never have answered, for it was not the right one!
   The way for them was to be thrown into the furnace and there to have
   the Son of God walking with them in the midst of the fire that could
   not hurt them! In like manner, whenever you are exposed to any trial,
   mind that you do not try to escape from it in a wrong way.

   Notice especially that the right way is always of God's making and,
   therefore, any of you who are now exposed to temptation or trial have
   not to make your own way of escape out of it. God, and God alone, has
   to make it for you, so do not attempt to make it for yourselves. I knew
   a man who was in trouble because he was short of money--and the way he
   made for himself was to use somebody else's money with which he had
   been entrusted. That was not God's way of escape for him, so he only
   plunged himself into a worse trial than he was in before! I have known
   a man of business in great trouble and things were going wrong with
   him, so he speculated, gambled and ruined both his business and his
   personal character. That was not God's way for him to escape from his
   troubles! Sometimes the best thing a man in trouble can do is to do
   nothing at all--but to leave all in the hands of God. "Stand still, and
   see the salvation of the Lord."

   When the Israelites came out of Egypt, God led them in a way at which
   men might well have quibbled. There was nothing before them but the sea
   and behind them came Pharaoh in all his rage, crying, "I will pursue, I
   will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon
   them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them." Now, then,
   what was God's way of escape for them? Right through the Red Sea! And
   on the other side they sang, when the Egyptians were drowned, "Sing you
   to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider
   has He thrown into the sea." It would have been a great pity if they
   had tried to escape by any way of their own, or had attempted to turn
   around and fight Pharaoh--that would not have done at all--but the Lord
   made for His people the very best way of escape that could possibly
   have been devised.

   Notice, also, that the Lord makes the way of escape "with the
   temptation." He suffered the trial to come and, at the same time He
   made the way of escape from it. God has planned it all, my Brothers and
   Sisters, how you, His champion, shall go forth and fight valiantly in
   His strength--and how He will be your shield and your exceedingly great
   reward. He will lead you into the dangerous situation, but He can see
   the way out of it as well as the way into it, and He will take you
   safely through. Did not the Psalmist sing, "To Him which led His people
   through the wilderness: for His mercy endures forever"? He not only led
   them into the wilderness, but He led them through it, blessed be His
   holy name! And if He has brought you into the wilderness of trouble and
   affliction, He made the way out of it at the same time that He made the
   trouble. "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the
   land, and verily you shall be fed. Delight yourself, also, in the Lord;
   and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way unto
   the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass. And He
   shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as
   the noonday. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him: fret not
   yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who
   brings wicked devices to pass." "Seek you first the Kingdom of God and
   His righteousness," and all else that you need shall be added unto you.
   Keep clear of the sin of the temptation and you need not fear the
   sorrow of the temptation. If the trials do not drive you to your own
   devices, but drive you to your knees, they will, after all, be
   blessings to you.

   That is the fourth comfort, that God has made the way of escape for His
   people out of their trials. "Well, then," says someone, "I shall escape
   from this trial." Wait a moment, my Friend, and listen to the closing
   words of the text, with which I will conclude my discourse.

   V. This is the last point of comfort, THE SUPPORT WHICH GOD SUPPLIES IN
   THE TRIAL--"that you may be able to bear it."

   God's way of escape from trial is not for His people to avoid it, so as
   not to pass through it, but such an escape as leads them through the
   trouble and out at the other end--not an escape from the Red Sea, but
   an escape through the Red Sea from a still greater trial! If you,
   Beloved, are exposed to trial or temptation, you are to be made able to
   bear it. Now, pray, before you leave this building, that this last
   word, upon which I have not time to enlarge, may be fulfilled in your
   experience--"that you may be able to bear it."

   Suppose you are to be poor. Well, if God has so appointed it, you
   willbe poor, therefore pray that you may be able to bear it. With
   honest industry and stern integrity, struggle to attain to a better
   position, but, if all your efforts fail, then say to the Lord,
   "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." Perhaps your dear child
   is dying, or your wife is sickening. You dread the thought of losing
   them and you would willingly give your life, if you could, for them.
   Well, do all you can for their recovery, for life is precious, and any
   money spent to save it will be well spent. But, if health is not to be
   granted to them, pray that you may be able to bear even that heavy
   trial. It is wonderful how God helps His people to bear troubles which
   they thought would crush them. I have seen poor feeble women that I
   thought would die under their bereavement, become brave and strong! And
   I have seen men who were faint-hearted in the prospect of trouble,
   nevertheless bless the Lord for it when the blow has actually fallen!
   And you may do the same.

   Suppose you are to be sick. Well, that is a sore trial and I know that,
   personally, I would do anything I could to escape from the affliction
   that often besets me, but if it must not be, then I must change my note
   and pray that I may be able to bear it. I had a letter from a man of
   God, this morning, which sustained me very much. He said, "My dear
   Brother, I was sorry to hear that you were again in pain and depressed
   in spirit, and so forth, but, as I remembered how God had blessed you
   in so many ways, I thought to myself, 'Perhaps Mr. Spurgeon would not
   have kept to preaching the Doctrines of Grace, and would not have been
   so able to comfort God's poor people if he did not get these smart
   touches sometimes.' So," he said, "I congratulate you upon these
   trials!" And I accepted the congratulations. Will not you do the same,
   my afflicted Brother or Sister? Pray, "Lord, if it is possible, let
   this cup pass from me," but, if it must not, then here comes that other
   form of comfort, "that I may be able to bear it."

   And remember, dear Friends, while I tell you to make this passage into
   a prayer, it is really a promise, and there is no prayer like a promise
   that is turned, as it were, roundabout, and cut prayer-wise! God
   Himself has said, by His inspired Apostle, that He "will not suffer you
   to be tempted beyond what you are able; but will with the temptation
   also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it." Up with
   the banners, then! Forward, whatever obstructs the way! Let us sing,
   with good old John Ryland--

   "Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes!
   'Hinder me not, 'shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose!" The
   immortal life within us can never be destroyed! The Divine Nature,
   which God, the Holy Spirit, has implanted, shall never be trodden under
   foot! "Rejoice not against me, O my enemy. When I fall, I shall arise.
   When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me."

   But, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry am I, from the bottom of my soul,
   for you who know not the Lord, for this comfort is not for you! Seek
   Him, I pray you! Seek Him as your Savior. Look to Him and trust in
   Him--and then all the blessings of the Everlasting Covenant shall be
   yours, for the Father has given Him to be a Leader and Commander unto
   the people, and they that look to Him, and follow Him, shall live
   forever and ever! God bless you, for Christ's sake! Amen.

Open Praise and Public Confession

   (No. 2604)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 8, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11,
   1883.

   "I will praise You with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing
   praise unto You. I will worship toward Your holy Temple, and praise
   Your name for Your loving kindness and for Your Truth: for You have
   magnified Your Word above all Your name. In the day when I cried, You
   answered me, and strengthened me with strength in my soul." Psalm
   138:1-3.

   IT is a very grievous thing, to one who worships the only living and
   true God, to see others engaged in idolatrous worship. It stirs one's
   indignation to see a man worship--not his own hands, but what is even
   worse than that--the thing which he has made with his own hands and
   which must, therefore, be inferior to himself. As the righteous soul of
   Lot in Sodom was vexed with the filthy conversation of the inhabitants
   of that guilty city, so the righteous soul of David was vexed when he
   saw the many lords and gods before whom his neighbors were bowing down
   and, in like manner, as long as we are in this world, we shall often be
   troubled through seeing how others turn aside from the living God, how
   they forget His Truth, set up thoughts of their own in the place of the
   thoughts of God and dishonor the Holy Scripture by thinking that their
   own vain ideas can equal, if not even excel, the Revelation of God!

   David, in this matter, becomes a guide to us. What he did in the
   presence of the idols of the heathen is, to a great extent, what we
   should do in the presence of the false systems of religion and the
   errors which are all around us! You, dear Friends, cannot love the
   right if you do not hate the wrong! I would not give a penny for your
   love to the Truth of God if it is not accompanied with a hearty hatred
   of error. I have taken this text as an instruction to myself as well as
   to you. What David did with all his heart, as a man who loved Jehovah,
   the only true God, we also should do if, indeed, we love the Lord Jesus
   Christ and all the glorious Truths which cluster around His glorious
   Deity and His atoning Sacrifice.

   I. How, then, will we act? We will try to act exactly as David did, and
   if we do so, we shall, first of all, SING WITH WHOLE-HEARTED PRAISE. "I
   will praise You with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise
   unto You." This seems a very singular thing to do. Here is a man
   indignant with these false gods--one would suppose that he would begin
   to argue on behalf of the true God, that he would raise a controversy
   on behalf of Jehovah--but he does nothing of the kind. At least, this
   is not the first thing that he does. He begins to praise God and to
   sing that praise aloud! "I will praise You with my whole heart: before
   the gods will I sing praise unto You."

   This was a very singular method of procedure, yet a very wise one, for,
   first, his song would openly show his contempt for the false gods. What
   does it matter to him what these idols really are? Men call them gods,
   so, for the moment, he calls them gods, too. And he begins to sing, not
   to them, but to his own God, the only living and true God! He pitches
   the tune, he lifts up the strain, he sings a Psalm--and this is the
   theme of his music--"Glorious are You, O Jehovah!" And he does this in
   the very presence of the idol gods and their worshippers, as much as to
   say, "I take so little notice of them all that I will not even be
   disturbed about them. I was singing the praises of Jehovah and I shall
   go on singing them. I was full of holy joy and I intend, still, to be
   so. Those gods of the heathen are nothing, but our God made the
   heavens! Therefore, I will not rob Him of His Glory, or deprive Him of
   His full revenue of praise, by turning aside even for a single moment
   to pay any attention to these mere blocks of wood and stone." It was a
   wise way of acting on the part of David, and it was also a generous
   way, because he did not in words pour contempt upon the idols, but he
   showed his contempt for them by presenting his praise to Jehovah alone.

   Let us do the same, Beloved. Do not worry yourself about those who turn
   aside from the Truth of God and run in their own crooked ways. Warn
   them as best you can, but remember David's advice on another
   occasion--"Fret not yourself because of evildoers." You have better
   work to do than to fret about them! Begin to praise your God and go on
   praising Him! Sing as many songs unto Him as ever you did and let your
   heart be just as glad as ever it can be. "Why do the heathen rage and
   the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves
   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His
   anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their
   cords from us. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall
   have them in derision." And if the Lord laughs, let us not cry! If He
   treats them with such calm contempt, let us do the same and lift up our
   voices again and again unto Him whose mercy endures forever, and whose
   throne is so established that all the leaguered hosts of earth and Hell
   cannot shake it for a single moment! "Say among the heathen that the
   Lord reigns." "The Lord sits upon the flood; yes, the Lord sits King
   forever." Therefore, let no man's heart fail him, but let all who love
   the Lord show their contempt for His adversaries by pouring out their
   joyful adoration unto the Most High!

   I like David's plan of dealing with the idols, by continuing his
   wholehearted praise to God, because, next, it would show his strong
   faith in the true God. I cannot tell any better way by which he could
   have shown his confidence in Jehovah. He had already poured contempt
   upon the false gods, but now his calm, happy singing proves his
   reverence for the Most High and makes men see that if they doubt, he
   does not! If they rail, he knows how vain their railing is. It proves
   to them that there is at least one man who has true faith in God, for
   he stands like a solid rock amid the surging sea. He is not moved. No,
   he is not affected enough to postpone his music, but he keeps on
   singing and singing the more loudly, as the more the sea roars and the
   fullness thereof. The more shrill the noise of the tumultuous
   idolaters, the more does he proclaim aloud his holy joy and his
   unshaken confidence in his God! True faith is one of the best of
   sermons. He who is--

   "Calm 'mid the bewildering cry, Confident of victory,"

   has, by that trustful calmness, done more to inspire the timid with
   confidence than if he were the most eloquent of men who had, with great
   vehemence, urged them to trust in God. Thank God, faith, as well as
   unbelief, is contagious! And if--

   "One sickly sheep infects the flock, And poisons all the rest"--

   there is another side to that Truth--one true Believer tends to
   strengthen all the rest and to make them "strong in the Lord, and in
   the power of His might." He who can sing as he goes to battle, if he is
   a leader, is likely to lead a tribe of heroes in his train! He who can
   sing in the time of shipwreck is likely to put courage into everyone of
   the crew, so that they do their best for the laboring vessel and, if it
   is possible, bring her safely into the haven. Sing, then, Brother!
   Sing, my Sister, for this will prove your child-like confidence in God,
   your implicit reliance upon Him! That is a second commendation of
   David's mode of action.

   The next is that by continuing to praise Jehovah in the presence of the
   idols, he declared his all-absorbing zeal for God's Glory. He did not
   need to stand up and say, "I love the Lord with all my heart." Hear him
   sing, "I will praise You with my whole heart." See what force he puts
   into every note! Listen to his jubilant song--you can tell by the very
   sound of his voice that his praise of Jehovah comes up from his
   heart--and from his whole heart. He is enthusiastic, he is full of
   confidence! If he had a doubt concerning Jehovah, he could not sing
   like that. And if he were lukewarm, he would not sing like that. But,
   as he is singing with his whole heart, those who are opposed to him say
   to themselves, "It is no use to trouble ourselves about thatman--we
   shall never turn him from the faith." They will sheer off, one by one,
   knowing that it is no use to attack such a firm Believer. He who
   praises God with his whole heart is like a man on fire--he is terrible
   to the adversaries of the Most High. When the great Spanish Armada was
   ready to swoop down upon the English coast, our brave Admiral Drake
   took some of his small ships and placed them where the wind would carry
   them right among the Spanish fleet. He filled the vessels with
   combustible material and set them afire. Then he had no need to go,
   himself, for the wind just took the fire-ships and drifted them up
   against the Spanish galleons that floated high out of the water--and
   exposed a vast surface to the air--and one and another of the big
   unwieldy monsters were soon on fire-- and a great victory was won
   without a blow being struck!

   So, I like to get a red-hot Christian full of music and praise unto
   Jehovah and just let him go, by the influence of the Holy Spirit, right
   into the middle of the adversaries of the Truth of God! They cannot
   make him out! They do not know how to handle a man on fire! If he would
   try to argue with them, they might overwhelm him with their logic. If
   he would fire a shot at them, they could shoot back at him. But he does
   nothing of the kind. He simply blazes and burns to the Glory of
   God--and that is a most effective mode of warfare with the Lord's
   enemies. Suppose, my Brothers and Sisters, that you were to have your
   hearts all on fire, burning and glowing with the intense conviction
   that the Gospel is true and that the God of Heaven and earth is the one
   living and true God--and that the atoning blood of the Divine Savior is
   the one hope of guilty sinners? Then you might do grand work for God!
   Tolerate no doubt in your spirit! Believe right up to the hilt with
   unstaggering confidence and then sing out your praises of Jehovah with
   a joyful confidence! Those who hate the Truth of God will not know what
   to make of you. They will probably get out of your way as quickly as
   possible, but, if they do not, then perhaps you will set them on fire
   and it may be, by the Grace of God, that you will burn up some of their
   errors and put them into a terrible state of confusion and anxiety if
   they still resolve to fight against the Lord of Hosts!

   It was a wise plan, this of David, of getting in among the heathen gods
   and singing to the praise of Jehovah! They could not understand him,
   but they were affected by his singing all the same. If he could have
   walked through any temple where all the idol gods could have been
   gathered together, and if he could have sung, there, the words of our
   grand Dox-ology--

   "Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all creatures here
   below, Praise Him above, you heavenly host, Praise Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost"--

   I would not have wondered if old Dagon had come tumbling down to the
   ground and if Chemosh, and Milcom, and Baal, and Ashtaroth and all
   those other abominations of the heathen had fallen prone upon the earth
   at the sound of this glorious song of praise unto Jehovah! Therefore,
   if we would overthrow the idols of our own day, let us imitate this
   wise mode of action on the part of the Psalmist.

   I believe, also, that David was quite right in singing with all his
   heart before the idol gods because it would shield him from all danger
   wherever he went. To walk among the wicked is a dangerous exercise. It
   is as though a man had to go into infected air, or traverse the wards
   of a leper hospital--he is, himself, apt to become affected by the
   poisonous atmosphere and to become infected with some deadly malady.
   But, oh, if you keep on, with all your heart, praising God all the day,
   you may go with confidence wherever duty calls you! Ah, you might go
   between the jaws of death, itself, and yet suffer no injury, for an
   atmosphere of praise would be the best deodorizer and disinfectant
   wherever you might be bid by the Lord to go. As long as you kept on
   praising God and magnifying His holy name, no adversary could do you
   any harm. Remember how the hosts of Jehoshaphat triumphed in the valley
   of Berachah when they began to sing praises unto God--then were their
   adversaries routed! Remember, also, how Paul and Silas could not be
   held in bonds when, at midnight, they sang praises unto God! Then the
   prison rocked, the chains were broken and the doors flew open, for
   there must be liberty where men can sing unto Jehovah! Where
   wholehearted songsters continually adore the Most High, the prisoners'
   fetters snap and the foundations of dungeons are moved! Therefore, dear
   Friends, mind that you keep up the spirit of praise.

   I used to know, years ago, a poor old laboring man. He was a Methodist
   of the good old-fashioned school. I never met him, or spoke with him
   without finding that, wherever he was, he was always singing. He was up
   in the morning at half-past five to get out to his farm work and he
   sang while he was dressing. He sang as he pulled on his corduroys. He
   sang as he put on his smock. He sang as he walked downstairs, he sang
   as he tramped off down the street and he sang all day as he was at his
   work. He did not keep on singing while I was preaching, but he seemed
   almost as if he wanted to do that. And, every now and then, he would
   burst out with, "Hallelujah!" or, "Praise the Lord!" He was so full of
   thanksgiving to God that sometimes he was obliged to give expression to
   his feelings even when it would have been more proper if he had kept
   quiet! He was one of the holiest men I ever knew and I used to account
   very much for his simple gentleness, integrity and happiness by the
   habit he had acquired of constantly singing the praises of God. He
   worked with some men who were in the habit of swearing, but he kept on
   singing and, after a time, they began to think that it was not the
   right thing for them to swear. He went among men who drank, but he
   never left off singing and, somehow, even among such men, there was a
   kind of respect for him. It was so with all who knew him. His employer
   tried to put him where he would have easier tasks than others as he
   grew old. And everybody loved him.

   I always wished that he had been a Baptist--that would have been just
   the finishing touch to make him perfect-- and then we would have lost
   him, for all perfect people go to Heaven at once! But if I mentioned
   that subject to him-- and sometimes I did--it was not long before he
   began to sing and he would ask me to join him, which I gladly did. His
   was a happy way of living. I wish that I and all of you could rise to
   it. Perhaps somebody says, "That good man was a very happy, gracious
   soul, but still he was very childish." Perhaps so, but I would like to
   be just as he was. I do not speak of him as having been childish, but
   child-like, always praising God like a happy child who is always
   singing. You know, dear Friends, you can keep on praising the Lord
   whatever else you may be doing. You can sit down in your house with the
   needle in your hand, or go abroad into the garden with the hoe and
   still be praising God. We do not have half enough of praise, Brothers
   and Sisters--I am sure the devil would be more angry with us it we
   would begin to praise God more--and since we certainly are under no
   obligations to Satan to keep from irritating his temper, let us sing
   unto the Lord as long as we live--and defy the devil to do his worst!
   As he likes neither music nor song in praise of Jehovah, let him have
   plenty of them both! Let us continually do as David declared that he
   would--"I will praise You with my whole heart: before the gods (or
   before the devils, before the kings or before the beggars, before the
   drunks, before the swearers, before anybody and everybody) will I sing
   praise unto You."

   That, then, was the first part of David's action--singing unto Jehovah
   with whole-hearted praise.

   II. The second thing that David did was to WORSHIP BY THE DESPISED
   RULE. Even in the presence of those who set up their idol gods, and
   their false systems, he declared to Jehovah, "I will worship toward
   Your holy Temple."

   Some said, "Worship this way." Others said, "Worship that way." In the
   present day some say that the Old Testament is not Inspired, that there
   is much that is very doubtful in the five Books of Moses. Some are
   going to worship in one way, some in another way of their own
   inventing. But if we are of David's mind, we shall say to the Lord, "I
   will worship toward Your holy Temple." Let every other man have his own
   way of worshipping if he will, but, Brothers and Sisters, as for me, I
   say to the Lord, with David, "I will worship toward Your holy Temple."

   I admire this declaration, first, because it is a quiet way of ignoring
   all will-worship. "Oh," says one, "I am resolved to worship God with
   all kinds of show, ceremony, flowers and millinery." Another says, "I
   intend to worship God out in the fields and never to mingle with His
   people at all." Very well, you go your own ways, but I ignore both of
   your ways, for my way is to worship toward God's holy Temple--that is
   the way in which the Apostles and the early Christians worshipped
   Christ, not forsaking the assembling of themselves together, as the
   manner of some is--the way in which they cheered their own hearts and
   the hearts of their fellow Believers, with Psalms and hymns and
   spiritual songs--the way in which they spoke as the Spirit gave them
   utterance--the way in which they gathered around the Table of their
   Lord to remember His great love to them. You may go and set up whatever
   novelty you like, but I shall keep to that--

   "Good old way, by our fathers trod"-- and I trust that every true child
   of God will make this personal declaration to the Lord, "I will worship
   toward Your holy Temple."

   What did David mean by that expression, "Your holy Temple"? Well, the
   Temple, like the Tabernacle in the wilderness, was typical of the
   adorable Person of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was not that the tent in
   the wilderness or the Temple on Mount Zion was anything of
   itself--these were the places where God was especially pleased to
   reveal Himself. Now, today the Temple of Jehovah is the body of our
   Lord and Savior Jesus Christ which He, Himself, expressly called "the
   Temple." Let others worship saints and angels, if they will, but we
   will worship the Incarnate Christ and Him, alone! Let others worship
   the man and think him nothing more than man, but we shall worship
   Christ as God. I was delighted to sing with you, a little while ago--

   "Jesus, my God! I know His name, His name is all my trust! Nor will He
   put my soul to shame, Nor let my hope be lost"

   Jesus is not only my Savior, but He is also my God! And my prayers are
   to be presented to the Father through Him and to come up unto the Most
   High through the Person of the God-Man, the Mediator between God and
   men, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior! I will worship toward that
   shrine, the Person of the Son of God and God the Son!

   But the Temple was also the place of sacrifice and we shall only praise
   God aright as we trust to the one great Sacrifice. Oh, how many,
   nowadays, deny the great Truth of vicarious suffering, the
   substitutionary Sacrifice of Christ on Calvary, saying that He is our
   Exemplar, but not the Maker of propitiation and reconciliation by His
   blood. Well, do not trouble your head about these people and begin to
   argue with them, but say, "As for me, 'I will worship toward Your holy
   Temple.' I have not any hope of my prayers speeding except through the
   Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. I can have no assurance of being
   accepted by God unless I am 'accepted in the Beloved.' So I will offer
   no prayer but that which goes to God by the crimson road of the
   substitutionary death of Christ. 'I will worship toward Your holy
   Temple.'" Keep to that declaration with unshaken firmness of resolve
   and it will be the best answer that you can give to the idols, or to
   the devils, or to anyone else who may oppose the Most High.

   III. Now notice, thirdly, what David did. He went on from singing and
   worshipping to PRAISE THE QUESTIONED ATTRIBUTES--the very attributes
   which are being questioned in this present age. "I will praise Your
   name for Your loving kindness and for Your Truth."

   The true Believer should praise God, first, for His loving kindness and
   for that loving kindness in its universality. Some say that the God
   whom we preach cannot be a God of Love because He banishes unbelievers
   into endless misery. If they refuse His Son, He gives them no hope that
   there can be any hereafter for them except that of eternal banishment
   from His Presence and from the glory of His power. "The wicked shall be
   turned into Hell, and all the nations that forget God." And there are
   some preachers who cover up and try to hide this solemn Truth of God,
   or speak as if they had velvet in their mouths when they come to deal
   with it. I shall not do so! By God's Grace, I shall never do so! There
   is enough love in God to satisfy me and I shall not need to make
   another god in order that I may believe in his loving kindness! My
   heart delights to praise the very Jehovah of whom the Psalmist sings,
   "To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born: for His mercy endures
   forever: and brought out Israel from among them: for His mercy endures
   forever: with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for His
   mercy endures forever. To Him which divided the Red Sea into parts: for
   His mercy endures forever: and made Israel to pass through the midst of
   it: for His mercy endures forever: but overthrew Pharaoh and his host
   in the Red Sea: for His mercy endures forever."

   I am quite certain that He never executes judgment with a severity
   which will be questioned by right minds. And in the Last Great Day,
   when the whole of this dispensation is wound up, it will be seen that
   "God is Love." We may not be able to see it now--He may seem to be, as
   David says in another Psalm, "terrible out of His holy places." Jehovah
   Himself declares that He is a jealous God who will by no means clear
   the guilty--and there are many who quibble at that, but the Day shall
   declare it. When the veil is rolled up, to the astonishment of all
   God's creatures, it will be seen that He did the best, the wisest and
   the kindest thing which, all things considered, could have been done
   and, therefore, though I cannot yet understand all His dealings with
   the sons of men, yet I believe that they are right and I will praise
   His name for His loving kindness!

   There is a special note, here, which bids us think of God's loving
   kindness in its specialty. Many quibble at this great Truth of God
   which seems to me to be self-evident--that Christ should choose His own
   spouse. They want to have entrusted to them the selection of a bride
   for Him! They want God to be lackey to the free will of man and that
   none of His purposes should be carried out unless man permits it! Their
   notion is that the great Creator must sit and wait till He gets His
   creature's permission to be gracious. But as for us, Beloved, we adore
   the glorious Truth of His electing love. We admire the sovereignty of
   His Grace and we delight to know that He does as He wills among the
   inhabitants of this lower world and deals out His mercy, as Paul puts
   it, "according to the good pleasure of His will." Instead of disputing
   with idols, or devils, we begin to sing with all our heart concerning
   the special love of God to His chosen and the favor which He bears
   towards them that put their trust in Him! We cannot employ our time to
   better purpose--to argue and debate might be a waste of effort and
   might depress our own spirit. But to bless the name of the Lord will do
   us good and will also be to His honor and Glory!

   I find that the original bears another meaning--"I will praise Your
   name for Your Grace, and for Your Truth." Is it not a blessed thing to
   have that word, "Grace," always in the mouth? "Grace." Is it not one of
   the sweetest words that God ever permitted human lips to utter? And we
   often say, "Free Grace," even if some tell us that is tautology. If one
   tap of the hammer will not suffice, we will give two. If men do not
   understand what, "Grace," means, we will call it, "Free Grace" and we
   will bless and praise the name of the Lord that we have two such words
   in the language as, "Free Grace!"

   The other attribute for which David said that he would praise the name
   of the Lord is, God's Truth. Our heart may well be sad as we see how
   men are pecking at God's Truth. One part of the Bible is given up by
   one and another part is rejected by another. One of our wise men says,
   "I have given up all the Old Testament and a large part of the New."
   Well, Sir, you might just as well give it all up, because you evidently
   have no part nor lot in it, or else you would not talk like that! Those
   gentlemen who want to mend the Bible really need mending themselves!
   That is where the mischief lies in most cases. If they were savingly
   converted by the Grace of God, they would love every letter of the
   Book, from Genesis to Revelation, and find it food to their souls. But
   they do not know the inner meaning of it and, therefore, they despise
   the Scripture as being but husks to them. And I greatly fear that is
   all that it is to many of them. But as for us, we shall glory in God's
   Truth--in the historic accuracy of every Word of this blessed old
   Bible! In the absolute Truth of God of everything that is recorded
   here! In the certainty of the fulfillment of every promise and every
   threat that is in this Book! And, what is more, in the absolute
   correctness of every unfulfilled prophecy as being just as certain as
   certainty itself! There is where we mean to stand!

   We believe in plenary verbal Inspiration, with all its difficulties,
   for there are not half as many difficulties in that Doctrine as there
   are in any other kind of inspiration that men may imagine. If this Book
   is not the real solid foundation of our religion, what have we to build
   upon? If God has spoken a lie, where are we, Brothers and Sisters? And
   if this Book, for which the martyrs bled, and which sustained our sires
   in prison and on their deathbeds--if this precious Book which is today
   hugged to the heart of many a dying saint--is to be torn away from us,
   it shall not go without a struggle in which we will, if necessary,
   sacrifice even our lives! We will never give up the Bible! We will love
   it in life and in death, and we will still believe that it is the
   glorious and perfect Revelation, as far as our imperfect minds can
   discern it, of the loving kindness and Truth of God! And for it we will
   praise and bless His holy name!

   This is what David said he would do, and I recommend all tried saints
   to do the same.

   IV. Now, fourthly, there was another thing which David meant to do and
   that was to REVERENCE GOD'S

   WORD TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. He puts it thus. "You have magnified Your
   Word above all Your name." My text is such a great one that I need
   half-a-dozen nights to discuss it, so I can only give you hints of what
   I would say if I had the time.

   God's name, dear Friends, is revealed in a measure in Nature. In
   Providence that name may be spelt out, but David tells us, here, that
   the Lord has magnified His Word above all His name. That is to say that
   Revelation is made by God to be infinitely superior to Creation and to
   Providence as a revealing of Himself, for, first, it is more clear If a
   man paints grand pictures, even if I never saw the man, I know a little
   about him when I see his paintings. Yes, but if he writes me a letter
   and in that letter tells me what is in his very heart, I know more
   about him by his words than I do by his works! And there is more of God
   in some passages of the Bible than in the whole universe besides! If
   science could be all known, it would not contain as much real Light of
   God as there is in a single verse of Scripture, for the best Light of
   God is in the Word! There is other light, too, but it is only moonlight
   as compared with the sunlight. God has magnified His Word, for its
   clearness, above every other method of revealing His name or Character.

   It is not only more clear, but it is also more sure. If we look into
   God's works, one man sees one thing and another man sees another. But
   if you look into God's Word and you have a childlike spirit, you will
   see what another childlike-spirited man sees. If you are God's child,
   you will see what others of God's children see there. And in the great
   fundamental Truths discoverable in His Word, the saints are almost
   entirely agreed. The whole universe is not big enough to mirror God in
   all His Glory. If He looks into the great and wide sea that He has
   made, the glass is too small to reflect more than a part of His Glory.
   Suppose that God should reveal Himself fully in Nature? It would soon
   be seen that the axles of the wheel would be all too weak to sustain
   the weight of Deity! It is only Revelation that can truly manifest Him
   to us.

   Think again--God's Word is more lasting than His other works. The
   Revelation of God in Nature is not unique. If He has made one world, He
   can make another. If He has made one universe, He can make 50
   universes! But after having given us one complete Revelation of His
   will, He will never give another--that one stands alone. What God has
   made known in the book of Nature will all pass away--there will come a
   day when the elements, themselves, shall be dissolved with fervent heat
   and, like a worn-out vesture, all this material creation shall be put
   away. But, "the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word
   which by the Gospel is preached unto you," so that God magnifies His
   Word by making it everlasting. "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
   My Words shall not pass away."

   Does not God magnify His Word in your hearts, dear Friends? You have
   sometimes been in the fields on the Sabbath and a sweet sense of rest
   has stolen over you. In the time of harvest, or on a bright morning
   when the sun has risen, you have been overwhelmed with a sense of the
   Glory of God. But, still, that sweet feeling never comes to the heart
   so as to affect its secret springs like a passage out of Scripture! A
   promise from God will cast more light into your soul than all the
   beauties of sea and land! I do not for a moment depreciate the wondrous
   Glory of God in all His works, but, still, I do say God is seen better
   in His Word than in all His works besides--and He has magnified His
   Word above all His name! They say that we ought to alter Scripture
   because scientists have found out something or other. Yes, I know all
   about that kind of talk! Scientists found out many things years ago and
   within 10 years somebody else rose up and found out that they were all
   wrong! The history of so-called philosophy is the history of fools! And
   the philosophers of this day are no more right than those of 50 years
   ago. The men are coming to the front who will confute the positive
   assertions of the present and, when they have made their own
   assertions, and made their bow, another set of wise men will be coming
   after them to confound them! They are all as the grass that withers,
   but, "the Word of the Lord endures forever." It has been tried in the
   furnace of earth, purified seven times and here it remains-- still the
   pure refined metal--and in this will we glory and not be ashamed!

   V. Lastly, David was going to PROVE ALL BY HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. A bit of
   experience is the best thing with which to close up my discourse. "In
   the day when I cried, You answered me, and strengthened me with
   strength in my soul."

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, men say that facts are stubborn things, and
   so they are. And when a man once gets a fact with regard to the
   religion of Jesus Christ, he becomes a stubborn man. The man who is in
   the habit of praying to God and who is in the habit of having answers
   to his prayers--the man who lives a life of prayer and consequently who
   is enriched by innumerable mercies, says to those who deny the efficacy
   of prayer--"You may say what you like, but you cannot trouble us about
   this matter, because I am daily testing and daily proving in my own
   experience what prayer can accomplish." "Well," they say, "you did not
   get out of the trouble. You prayed, but you did not escape from it."
   That is quite true, I did not. But God strengthened me with strength in
   my soul and it is a grand thing when the mind becomes calm, when the
   soul grows strong, when courage increases, when confidence comes, when
   deep peace and quiet restfulness flow into the soul! All that is a
   blessed answer to prayer and as long as God gives us that, we cannot
   desert His standard, or deny His faithfulness and His Truth! Let those
   who will, go and leave the snows of Lebanon, and the pure flowing river
   of God for the broken cisterns that can hold no water, or for the muddy
   waters of Egypt--but we cannot, we dare not, we will not! God helping
   us, we will stand fast in our belief in the power of prayer! We have
   tried it, we have proved it and we are not to be shaken from our
   confidence in its efficacy!

   The Lord give to everyone of you who do not, at present know it, to
   prove it yourselves, to try it to your heart's joy and
   satisfaction--and you, also, shall stand fast in your confidence in Him
   even to the end! The Lord bless you, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM138.

   Verse 1. I will praise You with my whole heart before the gods wiil I
   sing praise unto You. ' 'Gods or no gods, whatever they may be, 'I will
   praise You with my whole heart.' I will not be ashamed to declare my
   confidence in Jehovah, whoever may listen to me."

   2. I will worship toward Your holy Temple, and praise Your name for
   Your loving kindness and for Your Truth: for You have magnified Your
   Word above all Your name. Now was his time to speak. The gods of the
   heathen had their worshippers. Then should Jehovah be deserted by His
   loyal subjects? "No," says David, "I will worship You, and I will
   praise You, whoever may oppose me."

   3. In the day when I cried, You answered me, and strengthened me with
   strength in my soul What worshipper of idols could ever say that of his
   god? "Ears have they," but they hear not the cries of their
   worshippers. "Hands have they," but they cannot deliver those who cry
   to them. "Feet have they," but they cannot come to the help of their
   votaries. But David declares that God had heard him in the day of his
   trouble and strengthened him with strength in his soul.

   4. All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O Lord, when they hear
   the Words of Your mouth. He felt that he had had such good things to
   say concerning God, such blessed Words of God to make known, that even
   the kings of the earth, when they began to listen to him, would become
   attentive and would even become converts--and begin to praise Jehovah
   with him.

   5. Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the Glory
   of the Lord Think of that--kings singing in the ways of the Lord!
   Crowned princes becoming choristers in God's service. Someone has said
   that there are few in Heaven who wore crowns on earth. And I am afraid
   it is true that of all who are crowned on earth, few ever get to that
   land where all are kings and priests unto God. To have a crown on earth
   and a crown above is a rare thing! But David says that these kings
   "shall sing in the ways of Jehovah: for great is the Glory of Jehovah,"
   and they shall be overpowered by that Glory--melted, subdued, wooed,
   won, converted by its power!

   6. 7. Though the Lord is high, yet has He respect unto the lowly: but
   the proud He knows afar off Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You
   will revive me. He was a king, yet he expected trouble. And do you
   complain when it comes to your cottage, after it had been to David's
   palace? "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me."

   7. You shall stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies,
   and Your right hand shall save me. He expected, first, to be revived,
   and afterwards to be protected. He believed that God would stretch out
   His hand, as men do when they make a supreme effort, and put forth all
   their force--"You shall stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my
   enemies." David also expected ultimate preservation--"'Your right hand
   shall save me.' You will do it dexterously, readily, gladly, will You
   do it. 'Your right hand shall save me.'"

   8. The LORD will perfect that which concerns me. "All that has to do
   with me--my business, my family, my work, my temporal and my eternal
   interests--'that which concerns me,' and that which troubles me, moves
   my heart with the deepest concern, Jehovah will perfect."

   8. Your mercy, O LORD, endures forever: forsake not the works of Your
   own hands. And He will not do it! He will carry on unto completion the
   work which He has begun, blessed be His holy name!

Death and Its Sentence Abolished

   (No. 2605)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 15, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 14, 1883.

   "And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
   has He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
   blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
   was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
   Cross." Colossians 2:13,14.

   IT tends to excite gratitude in our hearts if we remember what the Lord
   has done for us. It is not wrong for us to think of all that we still
   need from God, but it would be exceedingly ungrateful if we were to
   forget what we have already received. By far the greater part of
   salvation is already ours and though, in some respects, we have not yet
   attained, neither are already perfect, yet in other respects we are
   complete in Christ Jesus. If we are truly believers in Christ, we are
   already saved--we are not merely in a salvable state, but we have
   really obtained salvation. In Christ we are delivered from the curse of
   the Law of God and we have an eternal inheritance already secured to
   us. I must not dwell on that blessed theme. I only mention it, in
   passing, to remind you that it encourages our gratitude if we remember
   what the Lord has done for us.

   It also stimulates us to hope for more blessings in the future. It puts
   a keener edge upon our prayers and helps us to plead with greater
   confidence, for we feel that, inasmuch as God has already given us so
   much and done so much for us, He will perfect that which concerns us,
   and will not forget the work of His own hands. The remembrance of what
   the Lord has done for us is also quite sure to inflame our love. We
   cannot be cold-hearted if we continue to remember God's goodness to us.
   We must be glad in the Lord and, with that gladness, there must come
   fervent love to Him who has worked all these things on our behalf and
   brought us into the blessed estate of those who are saved in the Lord
   with an everlasting salvation!

   This morning, [Sermon #1744, Volume 39--Where the "If Lies"] I talked
   to those who were seeking the Savior. They had their turn, then, so now
   I am going to speak to those who have found the Lord. Ah, dear Friends,
   how precious He is to you! I want you to see what He has done for
   you--what God the everlasting Father has done for you through Jesus
   Christ His Son--that you may come and sit at His feet in adoring love
   and feel your hearts burn within you as you meditate upon the riches of
   His amazing Grace. Our text speaks of two things which God has done for
   us through Christ Jesus. First, there is the removal of the death
   within us: "And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
   your flesh, has He quickened together with Christ, having forgiven you
   all trespasses." The second thing is the removal of the handwriting
   which was against us. This we have in the 14th verse. "Blotting out the
   handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to
   us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His Cross."

   Before I come to the subject of my discourse, I want every child of God
   whom I am addressing to feel, "The preacher's talk is to be about me
   and about what Christ has done for me," for, remember, dear Friends,
   that the work of Christ is as distinctly on behalf of each Believer as
   if he were the only object of Divine Love in the whole universe! And
   while it is true that Christ's work concerns all His people--and it is
   a very great comfort that it is so--yet it is also true that it
   concerns each one of His people and it is all the property of each one.
   I want you, just now, to eat your own morsel, to claim your own portion
   and to take home to your own heart what God has given to you by a
   Covenant of salt, and so given it to you that it can never be taken
   from you!

   I. First, then, the Lord has done this for all of us who believe in
   Him--HE HAS REMOVED OUR INWARD SPIRITUAL DEATH.

   Turn to the text to see what this death was. "You being dead in your
   sins." We were all, then--the regenerate as well as the rest of
   mankind--"dead in trespasses and sins." What kind of death was this?
   Certainly it was not physical death. We lived, moved and had our being.
   We exercised our wills and did as we pleased in our enmity and
   opposition to God. The Lord does not treat men as if they were sticks
   and stones, nor does He ever regard them as such. They are alive, and
   when they sin, they sin most sadly of their own accord.

   Neither was our death a mental death, for the ungodly can think as well
   as others, and they have all the powers of reason unless, indeed, they
   have dulled and destroyed them by certain forms of sin which produce
   that result. Alas, there are some of the most acute minds in the world
   that are not reconciled to God. The men are alive enough as to their
   minds, yet they are truly said to be dead! I could almost wish, for
   some people, that it wasa mental death rather than the kind of death
   they have, since now the quickness of their intellect only helps them
   to increase their guilt and to multiply the reasons for their
   condemnation.

   And yet again, as it is not a physical death, nor a mental death, so
   neither is it a moraldeath. Man is not so dead that he sins without
   guilt, or lives without responsibility. No man who remains out of
   Christ is without guilt on that account. He who continues an unbeliever
   may not say that he cannot help it--it is his fault and his sin that he
   does not believe. Indeed, our Lord told His disciples that the
   Comforter would convince the world of sin for this very
   reason--"Because," He said, "they believe not on Me." To Nicodemus, our
   Lord also said, "For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the
   world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believes
   on Him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already,
   because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of
   God." O dear Hearers, if I could believe that you were mere machines,
   or that you had drifted along the stream of time like some stray timber
   on a Canadian river. If I believed that you could not in any way help
   yourselves, but were the mere creatures of your circumstances, then I
   might be comfortable concerning you, for you would be exempt from
   criminality. But it is not so--you are men and women living before the
   living God and you are responsible to Him for your actions and your
   words--and even for the thoughts and imaginations of your heart! For
   every rejection of His Gospel you will have to give account at the Last
   Great Day. And if you remain out of Christ, that account will seal your
   doom forever.

   The kind of death here spoken of is spiritual'death--death as to higher
   things than can be grasped by the hands, or seen with the eyes, or
   comprehended by the natural mind. Only the spiritual man knows what
   spiritual things are, for they have to be spiritually discerned. You
   would not think of teaching a horse the wonders of astronomy because
   there is no mind in the horse that could learn that science! Neither
   can we, of ourselves, teach spiritual things to our fellow men,
   because, until they are born again, born from above, they do not
   possess the faculty with which they can grasp spiritual things. Our
   Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, "That which is born of the flesh is
   flesh"--and therefore can only lay hold of the things that are fleshly.
   "And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"--and until a man is
   born of the Spirit, he is without the faculty of understanding and
   enjoying spiritual things.

   As far as spiritual things are concerned, man's understanding is dead.
   He can comprehend the highest and most wonderful of sciences, but he
   cannot--or, what is tantamount to it, he will not--understand the
   things of God. He turns on his heels and says, "I cannot make out what
   you mean." No, we know that you cannot, and we are not surprised at
   your lack of apprehension, for it is just what the Bible leads us to
   expect. We even find those who consider themselves to be learned
   divines rejecting the Gospel and saying that it is not consistent with
   their philosophy. We never thought that it was--and we never imagined
   that they could receive the Gospel until they are converted and become
   as little children. The great reason why men reject the Gospel is
   because they are not born again. Because they have not received the
   life of God into their souls. If they had, they would understand it so
   as to delight in it. But the understanding, spiritually, is under a
   cloud of night which the Word of God calls "death."

   So also is the human will dead to spiritual things. When a person is
   literally dead, he cannot will to come to life. Neither does any man
   ever will to come to Christ till the Spirit of God gives him that will,
   for his natural will is exerted in quite another direction, as our Lord
   said to the Jews, "You will not come to Me that you might have life."
   The will is a slave, it is held in chains, it is set on mischief and
   resolved not to subject itself to the will of the Most High. Not
   morally, nor mentally, but spiritually, the will of man is dead!

   So, too, is it true of the affections that they are dead to spiritual
   things. Men, in their unregenerate state, will not love that which is
   good. Alas, they will not love Christ. He is altogether lovely, yet
   unrenewed men see nothing in Him that they should love. Holiness,
   purity, the will of God--all these things are worthy of being loved,
   yet men do not love them. No, they love the very opposite until the
   Grace of God comes and quickens them.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, is not all this a true description of what
   we were before the Spirit of God begin to deal with us in His
   regenerating power? Were we not dead to all spiritual things? Some of
   you used to come to the House of God, but you were here just as so many
   corpses might have been. You used to visit where there were Christian
   people, but you could not understand what they said about their
   experience. You had no enjoyment in their joys, neither did you sorrow
   in their sorrows. There was a deep gulf between you and them--and the
   secret was that you were natural men and they were spiritualmen! You
   loved not the things which they loved, even as they took no delight in
   the things which charmed you, for you were in a condition of spiritual
   death.

   Consider, next, dear Friends, what that spiritual death involved. The
   text puts it thus--"You being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
   of your flesh."

   First, we were dead in sin. No, I quoted the text wrongly, for we were
   dead in our sins--the word is in the plural. They were our own sins,
   not the sins of our fate or destiny, or of our circumstances and
   surroundings, but our own sins. We willingly committed them. As the
   result of our death to everything that was holy, good and spiritual, we
   sinned and we took pleasure in sin. We repeated our old sins and we
   devised and invented new sins! They were, with an emphasis, our sins,
   our own actual, real, personal sins!

   These sins were very varied according to our condition and temperament.
   Some went after one sin, others after another. Some were quiet and
   gentle sinners, so that many persons thought that they were holy.
   Others were noisy outrageous sinners who were a nuisance to the parish
   in which they lived. Some were sinners under some sort of fear, but
   they would have sinned more if they had dared to do so. Others had cast
   off all fear, both of God and man, and plunged headlong into rioting,
   wantonness and all manner of unmentionable crimes. All these sins were
   accompaniments of spiritual death--they were just what winding-sheets
   are to dead men. There, then, is the picture of what we were and of
   what the unregenerate are--"dead in trespasses and sins"--lying there
   wrapped in the cerements of sin. We were surrounded, covered with sin,
   getting ready in that condition to soon be carried out to the eternal
   burial, to the place "where their worm dies not, and where the fire is
   not quenched." That is how I was by nature! That is how you were,
   Brothers and Sisters, who are now alive unto God. You may, perhaps,
   have seen an Egyptian mummy, bound from head to foot with the wrappings
   appertaining to death--so it was with you. Your sins were about your
   head, your heart, your hands, your feet! Sins surrounded you
   everywhere--and there you lay, as the text says--"dead in your sins."

   Now let us see how we were delivered. And as we lay our hands on our
   hearts and think of what God has done for us, let us prepare to bless
   and magnify His name. "You, being dead in your sins and the
   uncircumcision of your flesh, has He quickened"--He has made you to
   live--"you has He quickened together with Him." God, by His Grace, has
   made you to live in Christ. Do you not feel the difference between what
   you were and what you now are? Can you imagine what a change there
   would be if a dead man who had been lying in his grave clothes could
   suddenly sit upright, or rise out of the shell in which the undertaker
   had placed him? What a contrast between the state of death and the
   state of life! That is a very faint figure of the difference between
   what we now are and what we used to be. Do you not realize it, Brothers
   and Sisters? The things you once despised, you now value. And the
   things you then passed by with a sneer, you would now live for and die
   for! You used to hear about these things and it often seemed dull work
   to listen to a sermon. But now there is music in it from the first word
   to the last. That Bible of yours used to be like an old will to you,
   and old wills are very dry reading, but now you have found the record
   of a great legacy left to yourself and, oh, it is blessed work to read
   the will now--you could sit and study it all day long!

   Praying, also, used to be hard work. You managed to mutter, in a dead
   way, a few dead words, but prayer is now quite another thing with
   you--your whole spirit is alive when you draw near to God in
   supplication. In fact, you are a changed man altogether! I suppose that
   if you were to meet your old self, he would hardly know you, for you
   are so greatly altered. I daresay he would say to you, "Come, old
   fellow, let us go to the theater, or turn into this beer-shop, or let
   us go home and find some way of amusing ourselves." You would reply,
   "No, Sir. I cut your acquaintance a long time ago and I do not mean to
   have anything to do with you, so you may go about your business as soon
   as you like. I am not what I was, for I have been crucified with
   Christ--and I am dead, and my life is hid with Christ in God." There
   was one of the old saints who used to keep company with a woman in his
   ungodly days, and when he was converted, she met him in the street, and
   said to him, "Austin, you know me." "Well," he said, "yes, I do. But I
   am not Austin any longer. At least I am not the person that I used to
   be." Oh, it is a blessed thing when we can feel that we are not what we
   once were! True, we are not yet what we want to be and we are not what
   we shall be, but we are not what we used to be--and we shall never
   again be what we used to be! The Grace of God will prevent that, now
   that we have been quickened.

   But how are we quickened? Paul says that God has quickened us together
   with Christ. And by this he means, first, that we have been quickened
   mystically by Christ's Resurrection. That morning when Christ Jesus
   rose from the dead, all His people rose in Him! The sun was not yet up,
   but the Prince of Life and Glory had lingered long enough in the
   sepul-cher, so, awaking into life through Divine power, He began to
   unwrap Himself from the cerements of the tomb. He laid the napkin by
   itself for your use and mine, that we may wipe our eyes when our dear
   friends are taken away. But He took the grave clothes and put them
   together, that He might leave the house ready furnished against the
   time when we should be carried there--our last bed being thus supplied
   by Him with all the furniture we shall need when our time comes to
   sleep in it. Then He waited a while till the sheriffs officer came down
   to set the hostage free, for the angel descended from Heaven, the stone
   was rolled away and Jesus breathed the sweet morning air again. He that
   had been dead arose and left the tomb, no more to die! And, in that
   hour, everyone who is in Him was virtually made to rise. The
   resurrection of all whom He represented was guaranteed by His
   Resurrection, as He said to His disciples, "Because I live, you shall
   live also." That is the result of the mystical union between Christ and
   His people.

   But, as a matter of fact, and practically, you and I began to live,
   spiritually, when we became united to Christ by faith. Do you remember
   that glad hour when you first believed in Him, trusted Him, put your
   soul into His hands? Ah, then it was that you began to really live! Oh,
   what a difference that saving faith makes in us! In our Savior's
   parable about the two builders, there is one expression that seems to
   me very significant. Luke's account of it runs thus-- "Whoever comes to
   Me, and hears My sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is
   like: he is like a man which built an house, and dug deep, and laid the
   foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream bent
   vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded
   upon a rock. But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that
   without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
   stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of
   that house was great."

   Did you notice, as I quoted the words, that in the second instance
   Christ left out all about coming to Him? Yet that coming to Him is the
   essential thing. If you come to Him and hear His Words, and do them,
   you will have a rock for the foundation of your eternal building, and
   it will stand any storm that may beat upon it. But if you do not come
   to Christ, even though you hear His Words, that hearing can be of no
   permanent profit to you. Indeed, it will really increase your
   condemnation! It is the coming to Him, the getting into union with Him
   which settles and decides the all-important point in connection with
   our new life. So, then, it was when we became one with Christ by an act
   of living faith that we were quickened, blessed be His holy name
   forever and ever! If we do, indeed, possess this new life, let us show
   it! Let us prove, by our conduct and conversation, that we are no
   longer numbered among the dead, that we have risen with Christ and
   cannot go back to the tomb! We will have nothing to do with
   whitewashing the outside of our old sepulcher. We have left the outside
   and the inside, too, and now we live unto God and have done forever
   with the old state of death. I have set forth all too feebly the great
   work of God in removing the death that was within us, but if you feel
   that my words are true concerning you, your heart will beat high with
   devout thanksgiving to the quickening Spirit who has worked this great
   miracle in you!

   II. Now I come, secondly, to notice the great deed of Christ in THE
   REMOVAL OF THE HANDWRITING THAT WAS AGAINST US.

   Consider, dear Friends, what this handwriting was. When a man has some
   charge or insinuation against him merely whispered about and floating
   in the air, he hardly knows what it is. And, perhaps, if he is a
   sensible man, he does not care much what it is, but he lets it fly
   about till it flies away. But when he has an accusation made against
   him in black and white--when there is a handwriting against him, a
   charge written down and laid before the court, an indictment upon which
   he is to be tried--that is a most serious matter. Handwriting,
   especially in legal matters, is generally more accurate than mere
   speech, and there is, against every ungodly man, something written with
   the finger of God which he cannot deny, for it is absolutely true.
   Handwriting also abides. The old Latin proverb says, "Litera scripta
   manet," that which is written remains. Be very careful as to what you
   put into black and white because it may be brought against you many
   years after you have written it--when you may think very differently
   concerning it. There is, against every unconverted man, a handwriting
   which will remain and which will be brought up against him at the great
   Day of Judgment. It is not a mere baseless rumor floating about, but
   something tangible which will last and which cannot be removed except
   by the almighty power of God.

   What is meant, in our text, by "he handwriting of ordinances that was
   against us"? I cannot give all the meaning in a word, but, does it not
   mean, first, that the moral law, which we have broken, has written out
   a curse against us? Each of the Ten Commandments has, as it were,
   united with the rest to draw up an indictment against us. The First
   Commandment says, "He has broken me." The Second cries, "He has broken
   me." The Third, "He has broken me," and the whole 10 together have laid
   the same charge against each one of us! That is the handwriting of the
   Law of God condemning every man of woman born while he remains in a
   state of nature. The Jews, you remember, came under another law--the
   Ceremonial Law. Did that Ceremonial Law draw up an indictment against
   them? Was it not intended to rid them of sin? I answer, No! There was a
   lamb slain every morning and that sacrifice must have reminded at least
   some of them that a perpetual atonement was provided, but, as with an
   undertone of thunder, it also reminded them all that such an atonement
   was still needed, that, after a thousand years of the offering of
   lambs, sacrifices were still required! There was ordained a Day of
   Atonement with specially solemn ceremonies, but what did that day say
   to the Jews? That an atonement was provided? No, but that an atonement
   was still needed, for, as soon as ever that year was up, the atonement
   had not been made and they must have another Day of Atonement!

   The Apostle Paul expressly says, "But in those sacrifices there is a
   remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that
   the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." There was a
   perpetual remembrance of sin in every one of the offerings under the
   Ceremonial Law. I need not stay to speak of them in detail, but they
   were intended-- the most of them, at any rate--to continually remind
   men that sin was not washed away. Thus all the ceremonies drew up a
   handwriting and said to the Jews, and to us, too, "You need an
   atonement by blood. You are guilty and there is no hope of your ever
   coming to God except by a sacrifice which these rams and bullocks
   represent, but the place of which they cannot possibly fill."

   Then there is another "handwriting of ordinances that was against us."
   I think there is written across the very face of Nature the great Truth
   of God that man has sinned. Sin has so marred the world which God made
   perfect that none can go through it without feeling inconvenience and
   often sorrow and pain. There are some men who pass through the world as
   though it were a burning fiery furnace threatening their destruction.
   Why howls the blast upon the sea and dashes the galleon upon the rocks?
   Why have we earthquake, tornado, cyclone, and the like? Why, because
   man is a sinner! And there is a handwriting in the very ordinances of
   Nature written, as it were, mystically upon the wall, as it was at
   Belshaz-zar's feast--and this is what it says, "You are weighed in the
   balances, and are found lacking." There is also another handwriting to
   the same effect--for God's works always sing the same tune--that is,
   the handwriting of conscience within the heart. Conscience writes, "You
   have sinned. You have done the things which you ought not to have done,
   and you have left undone the things which you ought to have done." And
   if conscience is permitted to write in its own bold and, it sets down
   this terrible message, "You are lost, ruined and undone! The wrath of
   God has gone out against you." This is "the handwriting of ordinances"
   which is in every part of God's creation, though, alas, many are unable
   or unwilling to read it!

   Now let us ask, concerning this "handwriting of ordinances," what is to
   become of it? It will certainly be impossible for us to answer it, for
   "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." There may be some
   men here who know of little pieces of handwriting that have cost them a
   great deal of trouble. A so-called friend came to see you--it would
   have been a good thing for you if it had been your worst enemy, for you
   might have been more on your guard against him. Your friend wanted just
   a little help for a time--he could not meet a certain liability just
   then, so he asked you merely to put your name on the back of a piece of
   paper. You would never see that document again--he would be quite able
   to meet it in three months--there was really no risk in the matter. The
   plausible man said, "You have only to put your name there. You will
   never be called upon in the least degree. I have plenty of money and
   have only to call it in when I need any, so it will be all right." You
   were persuaded by him and, like a fool, put your name at the back of
   his bill. You knew that you had not the money guaranteed by that paper,
   yet you promised to pay it! You did not believe that text in the Bible
   which tells you that, "He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for
   it; and he that hates suretyship is sure."

   I do not know when that bill will come due. Perhaps it will be next
   week, but I know that you are feeling uncommonly uncomfortable about it
   as you sit there in your pew--and well you may! You say that you will
   never do such a thing again--it is not likely that you will have the
   opportunity to do so, but you will find that it is sufficient to have
   that one piece of handwriting against you--your own handwriting, too!
   It will be brought home to you sooner or later, you will see it again!
   Do not comfort yourself with the foolish idea that you will get off
   Scot free, for you will not. Such a case as that rarely or never
   occurs. You have given the bond and the man who holds it will, like
   Shylock, demand his pound of flesh! And the worst of it is that the
   bond is one of your own making and you voluntarily incurred the debt. I
   wish I could tell you how to get clear of it, but I am glad that I can
   tell you how to get free from a worse bond even than that--one into
   which you have entered through your sin--the bond of your own
   indebtedness to the infinite Justice of God for all your rebellions
   against His Law, all your breaches of His Divine Covenant! You have
   sinned against Him and it is all down in black and white in the
   handwriting that is against you.

   Now listen, dear Friends. The Lord Jesus Christ has done this for all
   of us who are believers in Him. First, He has taken that handwriting
   and He has blotted it out, as our text says, "blotting out the
   handwriting of ordinances that was against us." The Greek original has
   the meaning of smearing over or expunging the handwriting so as to make
   it illegible as a document to be produced against us. With His own
   atoning blood, the Lord Jesus Christ has discharged all our debt! As
   believers in Him, there is nothing whatever due from us to the justice
   of Almighty God, for Christ has paid it all. We cannot, therefore, be
   punished for our sin, for that would be unjust, since God will not and
   cannot punish, first the Substitute, and then the sinners for whom that
   Substitute bled and died. God's justice cannot demand the payment
   twice--

   "First my bleeding Surety's hand, And then again at mine."

   Christ became the Surety of all who believe in Him and He was made to
   smart for it. But, by the carrying out of His suretyship, He discharged
   all your liabilities at the bar of God if you are a Believer and,
   therefore, He smeared over, expunged, erased, obliterated the
   handwriting of ordinances that was against you--and it can never again
   be laid to your charge. This was the Truth that inspired that brave
   challenge of the Apostle Paul, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect?"

   Christ has done something more than this for us. Look at the text
   again--"blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
   which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way." First it is
   blotted out. Then it is taken away, lest the blotting out should not
   prevent it from being read--for you can sometimes trace through an
   erasure what was written there, and you say, "Oh, yes, I see what the
   entry was--'So-and-so, so many pounds in debt.'" Yes, but Christ says,
   "You need not worry yourselves about that handwriting, for I will take
   it away." So He removes the document, itself, out of sight! It lay in
   the court against you, but Christ first obliterated it and then took
   the accusation itself--the indictment, the charge upon which you were
   to be tried--and put it out of the way!

   Perhaps someone says, "But, possibly, after all, He may bring the
   accusation up again. He may only have hidden it for a while and laid it
   by that He may bring it out against me some other day. And when it is
   produced, some expert will examine it with his glass and through all
   the blotting he will make out the original charge and say, 'This man
   was guilty of such-and-such crimes.'" "No," says Christ, "He shall not
   do that, for I will let you see where I put the handwriting. I will
   take it quite out of the way, but I will fasten it up where you can see
   it"--"nailing it to His Cross." Ah, that is glorious! Just as Christ
   was fastened to the tree by those dreadful Roman nails, so has He
   nailed up all the sins of His people! And all that could be laid to
   their charge! I have heard that they used to drive a nail through the
   Bank of England notes when they were cashed--a hole was made right
   through the center and they could never be used again. And our blessed
   Lord has driven the nails right through the accusation that was against
   His people--and there you can see the handwriting hanging up upon His
   Cross!

   First He blotted it out. Then He took it out of the way and, finally,
   He nailed it up to His Cross and there it still is, its accusing and
   condemning power forever gone! Now, child of God, sit down and say to
   yourself, "As to all the sins I have ever committed, whatever they may
   have been, inasmuch as I believe in Jesus, the record is crossed out
   and, consequently, the very parchment upon which it was written (to use
   that figure) has been taken out of the way. And of that I may be quite
   sure that an end has been made of it, once and for all--my Lord has
   nailed it, as a crucified thing which He has put to death with Himself
   upon the tree of Sacrifice, and now it has no power to alarm or annoy
   me."

   What better way can there be of abolishing a debt than by paying it?
   And Christ has paid your debts and mine. What better way can there be
   of putting an end to sin than by bearing the punishment which was due
   to sin? The punishment which was due to sin was for us to lie forever
   under the wrath of God, but, owing to the majesty of Christ's Divine
   Person, the suffering which He endured upon the Cross was accepted as
   an equivalent for all that suffering which we deserved to endure
   forever! All the wrath due to Christ's people was condensed into that
   one cup of which He began to drink in Gethsemane. As He put His lips to
   it, and tasted it, so terrible was it that it covered Him with a bloody
   sweat! But He never ceased to drink until He turned the chalice upside
   down and not one black drop was found lingering there. At that one
   tremendous draught of love, the Lord had drunk damnation dry for all
   His people! And "there is therefore now no condemnation to them which
   are in Christ Jesus." How could there be any when Christ endured it
   all?

   O Beloved Friends, go in thought to Calvary, and with joyful hearts
   trust in the Crucified! The great transaction is done, and done
   forever! He has blotted out the handwriting that was against you and
   put it away, "nailing it to His Cross." All this is true of everyone
   who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. Then, trust yourself with Him,
   now, and my text shall be true of you at this moment and true forever!
   "You, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has
   He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
   blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
   was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
   Cross." God bless you all, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK--307, 430, 406.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: COLOSSIANS 2:6-23; 3:1-3.

   Colossians 2:6. As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,
   so walk you in Him. That is, keep on as you began. Christ was enough
   for you when, as poor, guilty sinners, you came and trusted Him, so
   keep on trusting Him in the same way as you did at the first. Do not
   try to live by feeling, after having lived by faith. Do not begin to
   live upon outward forms and ceremonies after having found salvation by
   Grace through faith. "As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the
   Lord, so walk you in Him."

   7. Rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as you
   have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Christians are
   to make progress in the heavenward road, but they are not to have any
   other foundation for their faith than they had at the beginning of
   their Christian career. We are still to stand fast as we stood at the
   first. We are to be rooted, grounded, "established in the faith,"
   keeping to the old Truth of God that saved our souls, and laying hold
   upon the same Savior with greater tenacity every hour of our lives. We
   are not to be like chaff driven before the wind--forever moving--but to
   be like the cedars of Lebanon, firmly rooted and withstanding the
   heaviest storms.

   8. Beware lest any man spoil you. Or, "rob you."

   8. Through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
   after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ Cleave to
   Christ, Beloved! Go no further than He leads you and turn not away from
   Him either to the right hand or to the left. In Him are contained all
   the riches of Grace and all the treasures of knowledge. If you would
   become truly wise, seek to know more of the wisdom of God in Christ
   Jesus.

   9, 10. For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And
   you are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and
   power You have everything in Christ that you ought to need. You are
   fully furnished, completely supplied and equipped for all future
   service. You need not go to Christ for the supply of some of your needs
   and then go elsewhere for the supply of other needs, but, "you are
   complete in Him."

   11. In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without
   hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
   circumcision of Christ Anything good that there was in Judaism, you
   have secured to you in Christ.

   Whatever there was of blessing and privilege in the Covenant mark in
   the flesh of those whom God made to be His people in the olden time,
   you have handed on to you by the death of Christ.

   12-15. Buried with Him in Baptism, wherein also you are risen with Him
   through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised Him from the
   dead. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
   flesh, has He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all
   trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
   us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
   His Cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show
   of them openly, triumphing over them in it The Lord Jesus Christ has
   done everything for His people--fought their battle, won their victory
   and, on their behalf, celebrated the triumph in the streets of Heaven,
   "leading captivity captive." What more, then, do we need? Surely Christ
   is enough for us!

   16. Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect
   of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days. Do not put
   yourself under the bondage of any rules and regulations that may be
   made by men. If you choose to do anything, or to abstain from something
   else because you judge it to be right and beneficial, do so. Christ is
   your only Ruler and Leader--and if He does not command anything, let it
   not matter to you who does command it.

   17. Which are a shadow of things to come. All this regard for meats,
   drinks, holy days and new moons is but a shadow--what is the great
   substance that is all-important?

   17, 18. But the body is of Christ Let no man beguile you of your reward
   in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels. Do not be beguiled
   by those who tell you that you ought to pay reverence to angels, saints
   and I know not what besides. One day is called St. Matthew's and
   another is St. Michael's. And one, I suppose, is St. Judas's day--there
   are all sorts of supposed saints, some of whom are never mentioned in
   the Bible and about whom nobody ought to care at all! "Let no man
   beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of
   angels."

   18-20. Intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed
   up by his fleshly mind, and not holding the Head, from which all the
   body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit
   together, increases with the increase of God. Therefore if you are dead
   with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in
   the world, are you subject to ordinances?Such ordinances as these--

   21, 22. (Touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with
   the using) after the commandments and doctrines of men? I have actually
   seen this text quoted as though it stood as a matter of
   teaching--"Touch not; taste not; handle not"--whereas the Apostle here
   means, "Why are you subject to such ordinances of men when Christ has
   set you free from them all? If, with a view to the good of your fellow
   men, you choose not to touch, or taste, or handle, you will act very
   wisely. But, as far as your own conscience is concerned, do not submit
   to any merely human regulations as to your manner of life."

   23. Which things have, indeed, a show of wisdom in wiil worship, and
   humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor to the
   satisfying of the flesh.

   Colossians 3:1 If you then are risen with Christ Leave all these
   outward rituals, formalities and ordinances of men.

   1-3. Seek those things which are above, where Christ sits at the right
   hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
   earth. For you are dead, andyour life is hid with Christ in God.

Choice Teaching for the Chosen

   (No. 2606)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 22, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 21, 1883.

   "It is written in the Prophets, 'And they shall be all taught of God.'
   Every man, therefore, that has heard and has learned of the Father,
   comes unto Me." John 6:45.

   I SUPPOSE that you never noticed any great literary excellence in
   Bradshaw's Railway Guide. "No," you say, "one writing would be very
   much out of place in such a book as that--it is meant to be a plain
   direction to travelers. When we consult it, we do not wish to be
   entertained, we want to be guided as to the best and quickest route to
   our desired destination." Well, that is the sort of sermon I am going
   to try to preach--one which, I trust, shall be a guide to Heaven to
   some who hear it, or who may afterwards read it--I long, above all
   things, that through my words many may find rest and peace in Jesus
   Christ our Lord.

   Notice, dear Friends, what our Savior was aiming at in this discourse.
   The Jews had been murmuring at Him. Certain followers of the scribes
   and Pharisees, who always opposed Him, had been whispering among
   themselves and finding fault with Him. Our Lord did not condescend to
   come down to their level and parley with them. They pretended that
   their difficulty was that He was well known among them, that He was the
   son of Joseph, the carpenter, and that they knew His mother and His
   brothers and sisters. Our Lord does not appear directly to answer them,
   but He takes quite a different tack. He says, "Murmur not among
   yourselves about this matter. Do not imagine for a moment that I am
   disappointed because you do not believe in Me, and do not suppose that
   your unbelief will at all frustrate My Father's purpose or surprise
   Him. You may reject Me if you are determined to do so, but your folly
   and sin will make no difference to anybody except yourselves. On your
   own head shall be the guilt of your own blood. I knew that you would
   not believe in Me. I quite expected that you would not receive Me, for,
   'No man can come to Me, except the Father which has sent Me draw him:
   and I will raise him up at the last day.'" And, Beloved, in a similar
   manner, when we are pleading with you that you should believe in
   Christ, we must weep over you as Jesus wept over Jerusalem! And we may
   say, as Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, "We were gentle among you,
   even as a nurse cherishes her children," but when you come to this
   terrible decision--that you reject Christ and will not have Him reign
   over you, then we fall back upon the eternal purposes of God--and we
   tell you that you have not received either the electing love of God or
   the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. And you are left to perish in
   your sins!

   To the ungodly and the unspiritual this may sound like rather harsh
   language, but should not men be treated with some measure of harshness
   if they spurn the Christ who is set before them and, in their unbelief,
   wickedly reject Him? True love is all the more loving because it is
   outspoken and sometimes seems even severe. There is a spurious sort of
   love current, nowadays, which consists in saying, "Ah, yes, you are all
   right and I am all right! You say, 'No,' and I say, 'Yes,' but, no
   doubt, we are both equally correct. You are black and I am white--or I
   am black and you are white--but, in these days, black iswhite, and
   white is no color at all! Let us make things smooth and pleasant all
   round. You praise me and I will praise you! It does not really matter
   what you believe, or what you think--we shall all get right at last."
   That kind of talk, or the preaching which comes practically to the same
   point, is infernal cruelty to immortal souls! I dare not use a milder
   term to describe it. It may be cried up as charity, but there is no
   charity in it! It is a shameful selfishness which, for the sake of ease
   and popular favor, cries, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace, and
   seduces men to their own destruction--playing merry tunes to them when,
   all the while, they are dancing down to death and to Hell!

   Our Lord Jesus Christ was not a preacher of that order. When men
   refused Him, He flashed the red light of the Truth of God in their
   faces and made them know that if they rejected Him, they rejected their
   only hope of mercy--and if they turned against His Grace, it was
   because they did not know its power and were not under its influence.
   He taught these people, who murmured at Him, that they never would
   believe in Him unless the Father taught them. He plainly declared that
   the Father would teach all His own and that if those who were listening
   to Him did not come to Him, it would prove that the Father had not
   taught them, that they were not God's chosen and, therefore, they would
   perish in their carnal and guilty ignorance of Him!

   Now coming to the text, I shall ask you to notice, first, thepromise of
   the Father's teaching of His ownpeople. "It is written in the Prophets,
   'And they shall be all taught of God.'" Then, secondly, we shall
   examine the teaching itself. "They shall be all taught of God." And,
   thirdly, we shall consider the grand result of the teaching. "Every
   man, therefore, that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes
   unto Me."

   I. To begin, then, there is in the text, THE PROMISE OF THE FATHER'S
   TEACHING OF HIS OWN PEOPLE.

   Christ says, concerning this promise, "It is written in the Prophets."
   I greatly admire that sentence because if there was ever anyone in this
   world who might have spoken on His own authority, without quoting
   Scripture, it was our Lord Jesus Christ! "In Him dwells all the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily" and, therefore, all His sayings are the
   utterances of Omnipotence and He often, when upon the earth, made use
   of that great double Amen, "Verily, verily, I say unto you." Yet this
   Divine Teacher, who spoke as never man spoke, continually quoted from
   the Old Testament and supported His own teachings by quotations from
   "the Law and the Prophets," and the Psalmists and other Inspired
   writers. In this case, addressing Himself to the Jews, He says, "It is
   written in the Prophets." The tendency, nowadays, even among preachers,
   is to depreciate and dishonor Holy Scripture. I am often saddened as I
   find how many are quibbling at one part or another of the Sacred Word.
   To my heart, there is nothing more authoritative or more conclusive
   than this little sentence, "It is written." If God's message to men is
   written, that is enough for me--and my great concern shall be to find
   out what that message is! Every man must have Infallibility somewhere.
   Some find it in the Pope, but I frankly confess that I have never seen
   the slightest sign of it there! Some find it in what they call, "the
   church." I am sure I do not know in which church to look for it, for
   all of them seem to me to be very, very fallible. I find Infallibility
   only in the Inspired Word of God! Here is a harbor where I can drop
   down my anchor feeling certain that it will hold. Here is a place where
   I can find sure footing and, by the Grace of God, from this confidence
   I shall never be moved. "It is written in the Prophets," is quite
   enough for me! I trust, Beloved, that it is also sufficient for all of
   you.

   That we may learn the lesson that our Lord intended to teach, let us
   look at the Words which He quoted. He said, "It is written in the
   Prophets." And, truly, the passage or its equivalent may be found in
   more places than I shall be able to refer to, now, but will you kindly
   look, first, at the 54th Chapter of Isaiah, at the 13th verse? Ah, I
   see the eyes of you Bible-lovers flash and I think I hear you say,
   "Fifty-fourth of Isaiah? Why, of course, that follows just after the
   53rd of Isaiah!" Precisely so and, that 53rd of Isaiah, as you well
   know, is all about Christ's Substitutionary Sacrifice. There we have
   the full-length portrait of the bleeding Substitute--"But He was
   wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are
   healed." Many of you know by heart that blessed chapter, so full of the
   doctrine of God laying upon Christ the sin of His people, and of Christ
   bearing all their iniquities that they might be forever free. Well,
   immediately after that great central Truth of the Christian faith,
   comes this 54th Chapter--"Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break
   forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with
   child," There is no better place for any to sing than at the foot of
   the Cross, gazing by faith upon the crucified Savior! O Earth, with all
   your barrenness! O heart of steel, with all your hardness! "Break forth
   into singing," for there is heavenly joy and there is the promise of
   Heaven, itself, in the death of Him who lived, and loved, and died for
   us!

   Further on in the 54th Chapter comes this 13th verse, from which our
   Savior quoted, "And all your children shall be taught of the Lord; and
   great shall be the peace of your children." This is apromise to the
   Lord's ownpeople. The teaching of Scripture is that Christ died for His
   chosen. "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it." God's
   promise, "All your children shall be taught of the Lord," is made to
   His own Church and to all who are the children of that Church, namely,
   all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life! All God's
   chosen, all whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, all
   whom Christ has redeemed by His blood, shall be, each according to his
   measure, in due time taught of the Lord.

   That is the meaning of the promise as we get it in Isaiah's prophecy.
   First, it follows the Doctrine of Substitution and, next, it is made to
   God's chosen people.

   Now will you turn over a few pages in your Bible, and read what is
   written in the 31st Chapter of the prophecy of Jeremiah, beginning at
   the 31st verse? "Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make
   a new Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
   not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
   that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
   which My Covenant they broke, although I was an husband unto them, says
   the Lord: but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the
   house of Israel. After those days, says the Lord, I will put My Law in
   their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their
   God, and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every
   man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for
   they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of
   them, says the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
   remember their sin no more."

   So, you see, this promise is joined with other blessings of the New
   Covenant Notice that when our Savior quoted the prophecy, He commenced
   with the word, "and." Now, as a general rule, when you make a
   quotation, you do not begin with, "and." That is a copulative
   conjunction which joins one sentence to another, yet our Lord begins
   with an, "and," as if to hint that there was a great deal going before
   it of which He could not speak fully, just then. There is "an
   Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure," which God has
   made with Christ Jesus, His Son, on our behalf. And all who were
   represented by Christ became, by virtue of their union with Him,
   partakers in all the blessings of that Covenant. Our side of it has
   been fulfilled by Christ, our Representative. He has done the Father's
   will perfectly and He has been able to say, concerning the part
   entrusted to Him, "It is finished." The side of the Covenant which has
   yet to be fulfilled is God the Father's portion--and that runs thus, "I
   will, and they shall"--"I will be their God, and they shall be My
   people. I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart
   from Me. I will instruct them so that they shall not need to have
   anyone to say to them, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know Me,
   from the least of them unto the greatest of them." What a wonderful
   promise this is! It is perfectly unconditional and freely made by the
   Father concerning all His chosen!

   As it stands in these two prophecies, as our Savior quotes it, it is a
   promise made to each individual of the chosen seed. "They shall be all
   taught of God." Then there shall not be one true child of God who shall
   not be taken into the Lord's school and be taught and trained by the
   Divine Father! Perhaps someone asks the very important question, "Do I
   belong to that blessed number?" Let me reply by making another enquiry,
   Have you been truly taught of the Lord? If so, you belong to the chosen
   company. If you have not been taught of the Lord, I cannot tell whether
   you are His or not. None of us can climb to Heaven and unroll the
   eternal parchments, to tell whose name is written there. And until
   there is some open and overt evidence of your being the Lord's, I
   cannot declare that you are. But by this test shall you know--if you
   have been taught of the Lord, you are one of His children, you are in
   the Covenant of Grace, and you shall have your full share of every good
   thing which the Lord has there laid up for His own.

   That, then, is the promise of the Father's teaching.

   II. Now, in the second place, let us briefly examine THE TEACHING
   ITSELF. "They shall be all taught of God."

   I want you to notice, first, that this teaching is practically the same
   thing as God's drawing. Let me read the previous verse. "No man can
   come to Me, except the Father which has sent Me draw him. And they
   shall be all taught of God." The way in which God draws men to Christ
   is not merely by persuasion, but by instruction. The Father does not
   draw us to Christ by a force which is contrary to our nature and
   will--we are not sticks and stones--and He does not treat us as if we
   were. We are rational, responsible, free agents and He deals with us as
   such, never snapping even the finest strings in the instrument of human
   nature, so far as it is human nature. So, when He draws men, He draws
   them by teachingthem!

   I will show you how the Lord does this. He first teaches the poor soul
   what a great sinner he is--and that makes him look for a great Savior.
   He teaches that poor sinner the impossibility of his being saved by his
   own works--and that makes him look for the works of somebody else. He
   teaches that poor sinner that He has authorized Christ to stand in his
   place and, by His life and death, to meet all the Law's demands on that
   sinner's behalf--and the poor sinner says, "Why, that is exactly what I
   need!" So, while the Lord teaches him, He is really drawing him and, in
   like manner, there ought to be a great deal of teaching in all our
   attempts to draw men to Christ--I mean, in our efforts to be the
   instruments of drawing them. If I stand here and simply shout,
   "Believe, Believe, Believe," I cannot expect that any good and lasting
   result will come of my shouting. I must tell people what they are to
   believe! I may try to persuade men to do this and to do that--and there
   may be great force in the persuasion, but, unless they understand the
   reason for my pleading, little will come of it. God's way of working
   should be our way of working and He draws men by teaching them! Observe
   that very carefully.

   Now notice what kind of teaching is here promised. It is Divine
   teaching. "All your children shall be taught of the Lord." "They shall
   be all taught of God." There is no teaching but that which will ever
   save the soul. My dear Hearer, you may listen to the best preacher who
   ever lived, but unless God shall apply the Truth of God to your heart,
   you will not receive it. You may study the best books on theology as
   long as you like, but unless God the Holy Spirit shall give you the
   keys of this treasure house, you will never get at its precious things
   and secure them as your own. Means are to be used--as I will show you
   in a minute or two--but you must not trustin the means--you must not
   even rely on the best study that you can give to the Word of God,
   itself, as the sure means of your knowing the Truth. Over and above all
   that, you need the instruction and illumination of the Holy Spirit! "He
   shall teach you all things." But unless you have His teaching, you
   cannot and you will not know the Truth of God. I would like, if I
   could, to unlearn everything concerning the things of God that I have
   taught myself. I desire with all my heart that all I know may be what I
   have learned of the Spirit of God and, dear Soul, if ever you are to
   come to Christ, you will have to unlearn a great deal that you have
   been teaching yourself, for nothing will be of any real worth to you in
   the matter of your eternal salvation but what the Holy Spirit, Himself,
   shall write on your heart and teach you. So, the promise of the text
   concerns Divine teaching.

   Yet notice, also, that it is teaching through the usual means. "Every
   man, therefore, that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes
   unto Me." "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."
   Though my hearing will not save me, yet, ordinarily, it is the channel
   by which God's Spirit works to the saving of the soul. Though my
   reading of the Scripture will not, of itself, save me, yet it is the
   usual way by which God enlightens the understanding through the Holy
   Spirit. Never neglect the means of Grace, I pray you, but, at the same
   time, never get into the condition that some are in who feel quite
   happy so long as they have been to a place of worship on Sunday, who
   return home and go to bed, just as if they had done all their duty for
   the day and had no need of anything further. They are like men who go
   to market, but do not buy anything. Or like persons who go into a
   field, but do not work in it. They are quite satisfied with having been
   to the market or the field. It must not be so with you, dear Hearers.
   If you want to find Christ--if you want to go to Heaven when you
   die--never be satisfied with mere hearing of the Word, but pray God the
   Holy Spirit that through the hearing you may be taught of the Lord.

   The most blessed thing about this Divine teaching is that it is
   effectual teaching. If you are taught by the ablest divine, you may yet
   learn nothing. But if you are taught of God, you will really know what
   you learn. If He teaches you what your sin really is, you will know
   it--perhaps even to despair. If He teaches you the meaning of His Law,
   you will know it as you lie at the foot of Sinai trembling. And if He
   teaches you the fullness of Christ, you will know that, and you will
   rejoice that He is just such a Christ as you need! Men are sure to
   learn whatever God teaches them by His Holy Spirit. There shall not be
   one who shall pass through His school and yet remain a fool. Though
   they were all fools when they entered it, yet, before they leave it,
   they shall be so instructed as to the way of holiness that they shall
   not err therein. My heart continues praying even while I am preaching,
   "Lord, teach me," and then it adds, "and, Lord, teach these people,
   too. Come and be their Instructor, for what can they know except that
   which You teach them ?"

   III. So I shall conclude with this last point--THE GRAND RESULT OF THIS
   TEACHING. We have read the promise of the teaching. We have thought
   over what kind of teaching it is. Now let us enquire--What is the
   result of it? "Every man, therefore, that has heard and has learned of
   the Father, comes unto Me."

   Some men say that they have been taught of God and then they go on to
   prove that what they know is of their own inventing. Our Lord's test
   concerning His disciples is, "By their fruits you shall know them." And
   this is the fruit-- every man who has heard the Word, and who has been
   taught of the Father, comes to Christ! Therefore, if any man preaches
   that which does not lead you to Christ, do not listen to it, for
   evidently he has not been taught of God. And, if you find in any book,
   teaching which makes you think less of Christ than you did before, burn
   the book! It will do you no good, and it may do you a great deal of
   mischief. All sound teaching leads to Christ, for if, when the Father,
   Himself, is the Teacher, the consummation of our scholarship is that we
   come to Christ. Surely, when we poor creatures are the teachers, we
   must be even more bound to begin and end with Christ Crucified. You
   were asking me, just now, whether you had been taught of the Father.
   You wanted to know whether you were one of His children. Well, here is
   the test-- have you come to Christ? If so, you have been taught of God!

   Coming to Christ is a very simple thing. It is the easiest thing in all
   the world, yet no man ever performed it until God the Father instructed
   him and taught him that sacred art. To wash in Jordan was a very simple
   thing, yet at first proud Naaman would not do it--he turned away in a
   rage! To believe in Jesus is a very simple thing--little children have
   believed in Him, persons who have scarcely been intellectually above an
   idiot have, nevertheless, been able to believe in Jesus! And yet, with
   all its simplicity, men never exercise it until they have been taught
   of the Father. I suppose it is because faith is so easy that they
   despise it. Naaman's servants said to him, "If the Prophet had bid you
   do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then,
   when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?" And it is only when the
   Divine Spirit humbles the heart and makes the man feel that he must
   stoop to anything so long as he may but be saved, that, at last, he
   goes down to wash in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God,
   or to believe in Jesus Christ according to the command of the Gospel.

   You are taught of the Lord, my dear Hearer, if you believe in Jesus
   Christ, that is, if you come and trust Him. And, if you do not trust
   Christ, you may be a Doctor of Divinity, but you have never been taught
   of the Lord. He is not to you "very God of very God," your sole and
   only Savior. It you do not trust Christ, you are a stranger to the
   Divine Light of God--that assuredly must be the case. You cannot be
   right in the rest unless you are trusting in Him. But, if you are truly
   believing in Him, then you are taught of the Lord. It is very wonderful
   how God brings His people to this point of trusting Jesus. I heard a
   little story which might have fitted very well into my morning sermon
   [Sermon #1745, Volume 29--

   Abijah--Or Some Good Thing Towards the Lord] but it was told to me
   after I had finished my discourse, so I will repeat it to you now. In a
   London court there was a little girl who had been to Sunday school and
   who had found Christ as her Savior. She heard that there was a poor
   woman lying very ill and all alone, up two flight of stairs, so the
   child went up to the room and pushed the door open. She did not show
   herself, but said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved." A nurse came in the afternoon, to attend to the poor creature,
   and she fetched in a city missionary to see the woman, for she talked
   so strangely, the nurse thought. When the good man came in, the woman
   said, "I am so happy, I am believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and I am
   saved! An angel came to the door and I heard him speak, and he said,
   'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved,' and I did
   believe on Him, and I am saved!"

   It was not an angel at all, it was that little girl! But it did not
   matter in the least who said it, for it was just as true whether an
   angel or a child spoke the words. I long that God should lead you, my
   dear Friend, to feel, "It does not matter how the Gospel comes to me,
   for if it is true, I believe it and I accept the Christ whom it makes
   known to me." Some of you probably think that if an angel were to come
   flying through the Tabernacle and were to alight just against your seat
   and say to you, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved," you would believe at once. But it would not make any difference
   in your believing, would it? It is the same message as I, who am,
   indeed, in the Scriptural sense, one of the angels or the Churches, put
   before you. You do not mind who brings the letter that is full of good
   news! I never trouble to send out to enquire the color of the postman's
   hair if he brings me a letter--I take it and read its contents-- and
   you need not stop to ask whether the message comes to you by an angel,
   or a babe, or a minister, or whoever it is! "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved"! And, if you do believe on Him, then I
   know that the Father taught you, I am persuaded that you are one of
   God's elect and I can turn and say to you, "Yes, though I have not read
   the secret roll of the redeemed, if you believe in Christ, your name is
   there," for there never was a soul yet that came to Christ except the
   Father drew him. And the Father never drew one by mistake and He never
   will! This is the blessed consummation of all God's teaching--that the
   taught ones come to Christ!

   But notice, before I close, that the Lord says, "Every man, therefore,
   that has heard and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me." He does
   not merely come once, but he keeps on coming. Do not make any mistake
   about faith in Christ, as if it were one single act and then were done
   with. The faith that saves the soul is an all-the-day faith and an
   everyday faith. If you believe in Christ, your faith must be of the
   kind that believes today, tomorrow and forever. If you say, "I believe
   that I believed in Christ 20 years ago and, therefore, I am saved," I
   do not believe anything of the kind! Unless you stillbelieve, you never
   truly believed in Christ Jesus, for the faith that God works in the
   soul is a continual faith! It has its ups and downs and, sometimes,
   like the moon, it is eclipsed, but it comes out of the darkness, again,
   and shines as brightly as ever! And, further, if you did ever really
   believe in Christ, you believe in Him now. "To whom coming," says the
   Apostle--not, "having once come to Christ, we now run from Him." But,
   "to whom coming," always coming, always trusting, always believing!

   And why is this? Because we are always being taught of the Father! I
   trusted Christ when I knew comparatively little of God's Word. And I
   confess that I still know but very little of its boundless height,
   depth, length and breadth, but I believe that as I grow to know more
   and more, I shall trust more. If that is not the result of your
   knowledge, it is not the knowledge that the Holy Spirit gives you! It
   is the knowledge that puffs up. If it were the Holy Spirit's teaching,
   you would rely more and more upon Christ and rest more entirely on Him.
   I pray for you, my dearly-beloved fellow Church members, that you and I
   may be taught of God till we grow less and less, and come to be nothing
   at all in our own esteem--till we vanish away into Christ and Christ
   becomes more than our necessary food, our life, our joy, our
   All-in-All!

   Everyone who is taught of the Father, in proportion as he is so taught,
   comes nearer and nearer to Christ until he comes perfectly to Christ in
   the Glory yet to be revealed. O blessed Master, we are still coming to
   You. We are, everyday, coming nearer to You. Your Spirit is making us
   more like You and making us long more for You! Your Father is creating
   in us more and more of a hungering and thirsting after You. Though we
   are very lame and do sadly limp, yet still we are coming to You. We can
   only feebly fly, yet still we are flying towards You and we expect that
   when You shall appear, and sit upon the Great White Throne, You will
   recognize that we are coming to You and You, Yourself will say to us,
   "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world." We are coming, Lord, to You! Come to
   us! Yes, come quickly, even so, come, Lord Jesus! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN6:25-51.

   These people had crossed the Sea of Galilee and gone to Capernaum,
   "seeking for Jesus." It seemed a very hopeful sign that they should be
   willing to make such efforts to find Christ, but see how the Lord
   Jesus, Himself, regarded it.

   Verses 25, 26. And when they had found Him on the other side of the
   sea, they said unto Him, Rabbi, when did You come here? Jesus answered
   them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, You seek Me, not because
   you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were
   filled. What very plain talk this is! Our Lord does not try to gain
   popularity by the concealment of truth, but He tells these people to
   their faces, "You are only following Me because of what you get out of
   Me." "Oh," some worldly-wise man would have said, "that is a very
   imprudent speech--it will drive the people away." Just so and Christ
   seemed to say, on more than one occasion, "If people will be driven
   away by the Truth of God, let them be driven away." John the Baptist
   had declared that Christ had His fan in His hand and that He would
   thoroughly purge His floor. And if that floor is to be purged, there
   must be a driving away of the chaff! Our Lord's example should teach us
   to speak in His name nothing less and nothing more than the Truth of
   God in all love and kindness. After thus pointing out the true motive
   which made the people seek Him, our Savior uttered a very singular
   paradox.

   27. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which
   endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto
   you: for Him has God the Father sealed. Is it not strange that Christ
   says, "Labor not for the very thing which you cannot get without
   laboring for it"? And then He says, "Labor for that which you cannot
   get by laboring for it"? He virtually tells us that it is so, by adding
   the words, "which the Son of Man shall give unto you," plainly proving
   that it does not come as the result of human labor, but as the free
   gift of the Son of God. He that is wise will discover the meaning of
   the paradox, but he that is blind will stumble over the letter of it
   and not discern the spiritual interpretation.

   28. Then said they unto Him, What shall we do, that we might work the
   works of God? ' 'We want to do the best works, the noblest works, the
   most acceptable works in all the world! Tell us what we should do in
   order to perform a God-like work."

   29. Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God. "The
   highest and best work which you can accomplish is"--

   29. That you believe on Him whom He has sent. Faith is the noblest of
   the Graces! It is the very essence of true worship! It contains within
   itself the germs of all excellence--and the man who believes in Christ
   has done that which is more pleasing to God than anything else in all
   the world!

   30, 31. They said, therefore, unto Him, What sign do You show, then,
   that we may see, and believe You? What do You do? Our fathers ate manna
   in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.
   Do you see the drift of their talk? They are still looking for the
   loaves and fishes and, therefore, whatever Christ may say, they turn
   the discourse round that way. If they can get from Christ something to
   eat, they will believe in Him--what groveling, earth-bound creatures
   they were!

   32, 33. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven; but My Father gives you the
   free Bread from Heaven. For the Bread of God is He which comes down
   from Heaven, and gives life unto the world. "The best and noblest
   bread--the bread which has Deity in it--the bread which can feed your
   souls, and sustain you with everlasting life, 'the Bread of God' is He
   which comes down from Heaven and gives life unto the world.'"

   34. Then said they unto Him, Lord, give us this bread. They said this
   not knowing what they said, and not understanding what He meant. Bread
   for the body was all that they wanted. Their cry was, "Give us bread,
   and we are content." They had no spiritual appetite for Christ, "the
   Bread of God."

   35, 36. And Jesus said unto them, I am the Bread of Life. He that comes
   to Me shall never hunger; and He that believes on Me shall never
   thirst. But I said to you, that you have seen Me, and believe not.
   These were the very people whom He had fed on the other side of the
   sea--yet they were craving for more. That kind of bread cannot stay
   their hunger for long. They had not received Him as their Savior,
   otherwise they would have been well content with Him and would have
   asked for nothing more.

   37-39. All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and Him that
   comes to Me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from Heaven,
   not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. And this is
   the Father's will which has sent Me, that of all which He has given Me,
   I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
   Christ will not lose one whom the Father gave Him, no nor any part of
   one. He will not lose the body of any of His people any more than He
   will lose the soul of any.

   40. And this is the will ofHim that Me, that everyone which sees the
   Son, and believes on Him, mayhave everlasting life: and I will raise
   Him up at the last day. Christ will never have finished His work upon
   Believers till He has raised their bodies from the grave and glorified
   them like His own resurrection body. He will never cease from the work
   which He has commenced on any of His people till He has laid the top
   stone in the glorious perfections of Heaven! And this Truth of God is
   the joy of our hearts even now.

   41. The Jews then murmured at Him, because He said, I am the Bread
   which came down from Heaven. They muttered, murmured, whispered,
   growled among themselves at this saying of Christ.

   42. And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
   and mother we know? How is it, then, that He says, I came down from
   Heaven?This is just the way with men--they judge by outward appearances
   and if the Gospel comes to them as a thing beloved of poor men, if it
   is preached without much eloquence, if the service is without the
   attractions of sweet music or of gaudy attire--straightway they say
   there can be nothing in it! O blind bats, when God veils Himself in
   human flesh, can it be otherwise?

   43. Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
   yourselves. "I never thought you would believe in Me. I never imagined
   that I should win your confidence."

   44. No man can come to Me, except the Father which has sent Me draw
   him. "You are not drawn unto Me, therefore it is clear that you are not
   the subjects of Divine Grace. You think you are judging Me, but in so
   doing you are really judging and condemning yourselves." Whenever men
   sit in judgment on the Gospel, they soon let us know what kind of
   spirit possesses them. It is not Christ who is on trial--it is they,
   themselves--and when they rail at Him, they do but prove that the Grace
   of the Father has never drawn them to Him. "No man can come to Me,
   except the Father which has sent Me draw him."

   44-46. And I will raise Him up at the last day. It is written in the
   Prophets, "And they shall be all taught of God." Every man, therefore,
   that has heard and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me. Not that
   any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, He has seen the
   Father. "Do not suppose that even when you are taught of God, you will
   know the Father as I know Him, or see Him as I have seen Him." That
   Divine glance at Deity is not for us.

   47. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes on Me has
   everlasting life. This was how our Lord spoke straight to the faces of
   those who had derided Him and said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of
   Joseph, whose father and mother we know?" With the strongest Words
   which He was in the habit of using, He says, "Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, he that believes on Me has everlasting life."

   48-51. Iam that Bread oflife. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness,
   andare dead. This is the bread which comes down from Heaven, that a man
   may eat, thereof, and not die. Iam the living bread which came down
   from Heaven: if any man eats of this bread, he shall live forever: and
   the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life
   of the world.

Foretastes of the Heavenly Life

   (No. 2607)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 29, 1899, (C. H.
   SPURGEON MEMORIAL SABBATH).

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, EARLY IN THE YEAR 1857.

   "And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it
   down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land
   which the Lord our God does give us." Deuteronomy 1:25.

   You remember the occasion concerning which these words were written.
   The children of Israel sent 12 men as spies into the land of Canaan and
   they brought back with them the fruit of the land, among which was a
   bunch of grapes from Eshcol too heavy to be borne by one man, and
   which, therefore, two of them carried on a staff between them. I shall
   not say much, at this time, concerning the Israelites, but I want to
   show you that as they learned something of what Canaan was like by the
   fruit of the land brought to them by the spies, so you and I, even
   while we are on earth, if we are the Lord's chosen people, may learn
   something of what Heaven is--the state to which we are to attain
   hereafter--by certain blessings which are brought to us even while we
   are here.

   The Israelites were sure that Canaan was a fertile land when they saw
   the fruit of it which was brought by their brothers and when they ate
   some. Perhaps there was but little for so many and yet those who did
   eat were made at once to understand that it must have been a goodly
   soil that produced such fruit. In like manner, Beloved, we who love the
   Lord Jesus Christ have had clusters of the grapes of a bettor
   Eshcol--we have had some of the fruits of Heaven even while we have
   been on earth and by them we are able to judge of the richness of the
   soil of Paradise which brings forth such rare and choice delights.

   I shall, therefore, present to you a series of views of Heaven in order
   to give you some idea how it is that the Christian on earth enjoys a
   foretaste of the blessings that are yet to be revealed. Possibly there
   are scarcely two Christians who have exactly the same ideas concerning
   Heaven, though they all expect the same Heaven, yet the most prominent
   feature in it is different to each mind according to its constitution

   I. Now, I will confess to you what is, to me, the most prominent
   feature of Heaven, judging at the present moment. At another time, I
   may love Heaven better for another thing, but, just lately, I have
   learned to love Heaven as A PLACE OF SECURITY.

   We have been greatly saddened as we have seen some professors
   dishonoring their profession--yes, and worse, still, some of the Lord's
   own beloved committing grievous faults and slips which have brought
   disgrace upon their character and injury to their souls. And we have
   learned to look up to Heaven as a place where we shall never, never
   sin--where our feet shall be fixed firmly upon the Rock--where there is
   neither tripping nor slipping--where faults shall be unknown--where we
   shall have no need to keep watch against an indefatigable enemy because
   there is no foe that shall annoy us--where we shall not be on our guard
   day or night watching against the incursion of foes, for, "there the
   wicked cease from troubling and there the weary are at rest." We have
   looked upon Heaven as the land of complete security, where the garment
   shall be always white, where the face shall be always anointed with
   fresh oil, where there is no fear of our turning away from our Lord,
   for there we shall stand fast forever! And I ask you, if that is a true
   view of Heaven-- and I am sure it is one feature of it--do not the
   saints, even on earth, in this sense, enjoy some fruits of Paradise? Do
   we not, even in these huts and villages below, sometimes taste the joys
   of blissful security? The Doctrine of God's Word is that all who are in
   union with the Lamb are safe, that all Believers must hold on their
   way, that those who have committed their souls to the keeping of Christ
   shall find Him a faithful and Immutable Keeper. Believing this
   Doctrine, we enjoy security even on earth--not that high and glorious
   security which renders us free from every slip and trip, but,
   nevertheless, a security well-nigh as great because it secures us
   against ultimate ruin and renders us certain that we shall attain to
   eternal happiness!

   And, Beloved, have you ever sat down and reflected on the Doctrine of
   the Perseverance of the Saints? I am sure you have and God has brought
   home to you a sense of your security in the Person of Christ. He has
   told you that your name is engraved on His hand. He has whispered in
   your ear the promise, "Fear you not, for I am with you." You have been
   led to look upon the great Surety of the Covenant as faithful and true
   and, therefore, bound and engaged to present you, the weakest of the
   family, with all the chosen race, before the Throne of God! And in such
   a sweet contemplation I am sure you have been drinking some of the
   juice of His spiced pomegranates, you have had some of the choice
   fruits of Paradise, you have had some of the enjoyments which the
   perfect saints above have in a sense of your complete and eternal
   security in Christ Jesus. Oh, how I love that Doctrine of the
   Perseverance of the Saints! I shall at once renounce the pulpit when I
   cannot preach it, for any other form of teaching seems to me to be a
   black desert and a howling wilderness, as unworthy of God as it would
   be beneath even my acceptance, frail worm as I am! I could never either
   believe or preach a Gospel which saves me today and rejects me
   tomorrow--a Gospel which puts me in Christ's family one hour, and makes
   me a child of the devil the next--a Gospel which first justifies and
   then condemns me--a Gospel which pardons me and afterwards casts me
   down to Hell. Such a Gospel is abhorrent to reason, itself! Much more
   is it contrary to the mind of the God whom we delight to serve. Every
   true Believer in Jesus can sing, with Toplady--

   "My name from the palms of His hand

   Eternity will not erase!

   Impressed on His heart it remains

   In marks of indelible Grace.

   Yes, I to the end shall endure,

   As sure as the earnest is given,

   More happy, but not more secure,

   The glorified spirits in Heaven." Yes, Beloved, we enjoy a sense of
   perfect security even as we dwell in this land of wars and fighting. As
   the spies brought to their brethren in the wilderness bunches of the
   grapes of Canaan, so, in the security we enjoy, we have a foretaste and
   earnest of the bliss of Paradise!

   II. In the next place, most probably the greater part of you love to
   think of Heaven under another aspect, as A PLACE OF PERFECT REST.

   Son of toil, you love the sanctuary because it is there you sit to hear
   God's Word and rest your wearied limbs. When you have wiped the hot
   sweat from your burning brow, you have often thought of Heaven as the
   place where your labors shall be over and you have sung with sweet
   emphasis--

   "There shall I bathe my weary soul

   In seas of heavenly rest,

   And not a wave of trouble will roll

   Across my peaceful breast."

   Rest, rest, rest--this is what you need--and to me, also, this idea of
   Heaven is exceedingly beautiful. Rest I know I never shall have beneath
   this sky while Christ's servants continue to be so unreasonable as they
   are. I have served them to the utmost of my power, yet I am well-nigh
   hounded to my grave by Christian ministers perpetually wanting me to do
   impossibilities that they know no mortal strength can accomplish!
   Willing am I to labor till I drop, but I cannot do more than I am
   doing. Yet I am perpetually assailed on this side and the other, till,
   go where I may, there seems no rest for me till I slumber in my
   grave--and I look forward to Heaven, with great happiness, because
   there I shall rest from labors constant and arduous, though much loved.

   And you, too, dear Christian Friends who have been toiling long to gain
   an object you have eagerly sought--you will be glad when you get to
   Heaven. You have said that if you could attain your desire, you would
   gladly lie down and rest. You have longed to lay up a certain amount of
   riches. You have said that if you could once gain a pension, you would
   then make yourself at ease. Or you have been laboring long to secure a
   certain position and you have said that if you could only reach it, you
   would rest. Yes, but you have not reached it yet--and you love to think
   of Heaven because it is the goal to the racer, the target of the arrow
   of existence, the couch of repose for time's tired toilers! Yes, an
   eternal rest for the poor weary struggler upon earth. You love it
   because it is a place of rest--and do we ever enjoy a foretaste of
   Heaven upon earth in that sense? Oh, yes, Beloved! Blessed be God, "we
   who have believed do enter into rest." Our peace is like a river and
   our righteousness like the waves of the sea. God does give rest to His
   people even here--"there remains, therefore, a rest to the people of
   God." We have stormy trials and bitter troubles in the world, but we
   have learned to say, "Return unto your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord
   has dealt bountifully with you." Did you ever, in times of great
   distress, climb up to your closet and there, on your knees, pour out
   your heart before God? Did you ever feel, after you had so done, that
   you had, as it were, bathed yourself in rest, so that--

   "Let cares like a wild deluge come,

   And storms of sorrow fall,"

   you cared not one whit for them? Though wars and tumults were raging
   around you, you were kept in perfect peace, for you had found a great
   protecting shield in Christ. You were able to remain restful and calm,
   for you had looked upon the face of God's Anointed!

   Ah, Christian, that rest, so placid and serene, without a billow of
   disturbance, which in your deepest troubles you have been enabled to
   enjoy upon the bosom of Christ, is to you like a bunch from the vintage
   of Heaven, one grape of the heavenly cluster of which you shall soon
   partake in the land of the hereafter! Thus, again, you see, we can have
   a foretaste of Heaven and realize what it is even while we are here
   upon earth.

   III. That idea of Heaven as a place of rest will just suit some
   indolent professors, so I will turn the subject around and show you
   that the very opposite idea is also true, and may be more useful to
   certain people. I believe that one of the worst sins of which a man can
   be guilty is to be idle. I could almost forgive a drunk, rather than a
   lazy man. He who is idle has as good reason to be penitent before God
   as David had when he was an adulterer. Indeed, David's adultery
   probably resulted from his idleness. It is an abominable thing to let
   the grass grow up to your knees and do nothing towards making it into
   hay. God never sent a man into the world to be idle--but there are some
   who make a profession of being Christians who do nothing to serve the
   Lord from one year's end to the other.

   A true idea of Heaven is that it is A PLACE OF UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE.
   It is a land where they serve God day and night in His Temple and never
   know weariness, and never require slumber. Do you know, dear Friends,
   the deli-ciousness of work? Although I must complain when people expect
   impossibilities of me, it is the highest enjoyment of my life to be
   busily engaged for Christ. Tell me the day when I do not preach--I will
   tell you the day in which I am not happy! And the day in which it is my
   privilege to preach the Gospel and labor for God is generally the day
   of my peaceful and quiet enjoyment after all. Service is delight!
   Praising God is pleasure. Laboring for Him is the highest bliss a
   mortal can know. Oh, how sweet it must be to sing His praises and never
   feel that the throat is dry! Oh, how blessed to flap the wings forever
   and never feel them tire! Oh, what sweet enjoyment to fly upon His
   errands forevermore, to circle round the Throne of God in Heaven while
   eternity shall last and never once lay the head on the pillow, never
   once feel the throbbing of fatigue, never once the pangs that admonish
   us that we need to cease, but to keep on forever like eternity's own
   self--a broad river rolling on with perpetual floods of labor! Oh, that
   must be enjoyment! That must be Heaven, to serve God day and night in
   His Temple! Many of you have served God on earth and have had
   foretastes of that bliss.

   I wish some of you knew more of the sweets of labor, for although labor
   breeds sweat, it breeds sweets, too--more especially labor for Christ.
   There is a satisfaction before the work. There is a satisfaction in the
   work. There is a satisfaction after the work and there is a
   satisfaction in looking for the fruits of the work! And a great
   satisfaction when we get the fruits! Labor for Christ is, indeed, the
   dressing room of Heaven. If it is not Heaven, itself, it is one of the
   most blissful foretastes of it. Thank God, Christian, if you can do
   anything for your Master! Thank Him if it is your privilege to do the
   least thing for Him! But remember, in so doing, He is giving you a
   taste of the grapes of Eshcol! But you lazy people do not get the
   grapes of Eshcol because you are too lazy to carry the big bunches. You
   would like them to come into your mouths without the trouble of
   gathering them! You do not care to go forth and serve God. You sit
   still and look after yourselves, but what do you do for other people?
   You go to your place of worship--you talk about your Sunday school and
   Sick Visitation Society, yet you never teach in the Sunday school and
   you never visit a sick person--you take a great deal of credit to
   yourself while you do nothing at all! You cannot expect to know much of
   the enjoyments of heavenly Glory until you have experienced a little of
   the delight of working in the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.

   IV. Another view of Heaven is that it is A PLACE OF COMPLETE VICTORY
   AND GLORIOUS TRIUMPH. This is the battlefield--there is the triumphal
   procession. This is the land of the sword and the spear--there is the
   land of the wreath and the crown. This is the land of the garment
   rolled in blood and of the dust of the fight--there is the land of the
   trumpet's joyful sound, there is the place of the white robe and of the
   shout of conquest! Oh, what a thrill ofjoy shall shoot through the
   hearts of all the blessed when their conquests shall be complete in
   Heaven, when death, itself, the last of foes, shall be slain, when
   Satan shall be dragged captive at the chariot wheels of Christ, when
   Jesus shall have overthrown sin and trampled corruption as the mire of
   the streets, when the great song of universal victory shall rise from
   the hearts of all the redeemed! What a moment of pleasure shall that
   be!

   But, dear Brothers and Sisters, you and I have foretastes of even that
   joy. We know what conflicts, what soul-battles we have even here--did
   you never struggle against unbelief and at last overcome it? Oh, with
   what joy did you lift your eyes to Heaven, the tears flowing down your
   cheeks, and say, "Lord, I bless You that I have been able to vanquish
   that sin." Did you ever meet a strong temptation and wrestle hard with
   it, and know what it was to sing with great joy, "My feet well-nigh
   slipped; but Your mercy held me up"? Have you, like Bunyan's Christian,
   fought with old Apollyon and have you seen him flap his dragon wings
   and fly away? There you had a foretaste of Heaven! There you had just a
   hint of what the ultimate victory will be! In the death of that one
   Philistine, you saw the destruction of the whole army. That Goliath who
   fell through your sling and stone was but one out of the multitude who
   must yield their bodies to the fowls of Heaven. God gives you partial
   triumphs that they may be the earnest of ultimate and complete victory!
   Go on and conquer, and let each conquest, though a harder one and more
   strenuously contested, be to you as a grape of Eshcol, a foretaste of
   the joys of Heaven!

   V. Furthermore, without doubt, one of the best views we can ever give
   of Heaven is that it is A STATE OF COMPLETE ACCEPTANCE WITH GOD
   recognized and felt in the conscience. I suppose that a great part of
   the joy of the blessed saints consists in a knowledge that there is
   nothing in them to which God is hostile--that their peace with God has
   not anything to mar it--that they are so completely in union with the
   principles and thoughts of the Most High that His love is set on them,
   that their love is set on Him, and they are one with Him in every
   respect. Well, Beloved, and have we not enjoyed a sense of acceptance
   here below? Blotted and blurred by many doubts and fears, yet there
   have been moments when we have known ourselves as truly accepted as we
   shall know ourselves to be even when we stand before the Throne of God!
   There have been bright days with some of us, when we could set to our
   seal that God was true and when, afterwards, feeling that "the Lord
   knows them that are His," we could say, "And we know that we are His,
   too." Then have we known the meaning of Dr. Watts when he sang--

   "When I can say, 'My God is mine,' When I can feel Your glories shine,
   I tread the world beneath my feet And all that earth calls good or
   great. While such a scene of sacred joys Our raptured eyes and souls
   employ, Here we could sit and gaze sway A long, an everlasting day."

   We had such a clear view of the perfection of Christ's righteousness
   that we felt that God had accepted us and we could not be otherwise
   than happy! We had such a sense of the efficacy of the blood of Christ
   that we felt sure our sins were all pardoned and could never be
   mentioned against us forever!

   And, Beloved, though I have spoken of other joys, let me say this is
   the cream of all of them--to know ourselves accepted in God's sight.
   Oh, to feel that I, a guilty worm, am now at rest in my Father's bosom!
   That I, a lost prodigal, am now feasting at His table with delight!
   That I, who once heard the voice of His anger, now listen to the notes
   of His love! This is a joy that is worth more than all worlds! What
   more can they know up there than that? And were it not that our sense
   of it is so imperfect, we might bring Heaven down to earth and might at
   least dwell in the suburbs of the celestial city if we could not be
   privileged to go within the gates!

   So you see, again, we can have, in that sense, bunches of the grapes of
   Eshcol. Seeing that Heaven is a state of acceptance, we, too, can know
   and feel that acceptance and rejoice in it.

   VI. And again, Heaven is A STATE OF GREAT AND GLORIOUS MANIFESTATIONS.
   As you look forward to your experience in Heaven, you sing--

   "Then shall I see, and hear, and know All I desired or wished below.
   And every power find sweet employ In that eternal world ofjoy."

   You are now looking at it darkly, through a glass, but there you shall
   see face to face. Christ looks down on the Bible, and the Bible is His
   looking glass. You look into it and see the face of Christ as in a
   mirror, darkly. But soon you shall look upon Him face to face. You
   expect Heaven to be a place of peculiar manifestations. You believe
   that there Jesus will unveil His face to you, that--

   "Millions of years your wondering eyes Shall over your Savior's
   beauties rove."

   You are expecting to see His face and never, never sin. You are longing
   to know the secrets of His heart. You believe that, in that day you
   shall see Him as He is, and shall be like He in the world of spirits.
   Well, Beloved, though Christ does not manifest Himself to us as He does
   to the bright ones there, have we not had blessed manifestations even
   while we have been in this vale of tears ? Speak, Believer! Let your
   heart speak--have you not had visions of Calvary? Has not your Master
   sometimes touched your eyes with eye salve and let you see Him on His
   Cross? Have you not said--

   "Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,

   Which before the Cross I spend,

   Life, and health, and peace possessing,

   From the sinner's dying Friend.

   Here I'll sit forever viewing

   Mercy's streams, in streams of blood--

   Precious drops! My soul bedewing,

   Plead and claim my peace with God"? Have you not wept both for joy and
   for grief when you beheld Him nailed to the tree for your sakes and saw
   Him bleeding out His life for you ? Oh, yes! I know you have had such
   manifestations of Him! And have you not seen Him in His risen glories?
   Have you not beheld Him exalted on His Throne? Have you not, by faith,
   beheld Him as the Judge of the quick and the dead? And as the Prince of
   the kings of the earth? Have you not looked through the dim future and
   seen Him with the crown of all kingdoms on His head, with the diadems
   of all monarchs beneath His feet, and the scepters of all thrones in
   His hand? Have you not anticipated the moment of His most glorious
   triumphs, when--

   "He shall reign from pole to pole,

   With illimitable sway?"

   Yes, you have, and therein you have had foretastes of Heaven. When
   Christ has thus revealed Himself to you, you have looked within the
   veil and, therefore, you have seen what is there. You have had some
   glimpses of Jesus while here-- those glimpses of Jesus are but the
   beginning of what shall never end! Those joyous melodies of praise and
   thanksgiving are but the preludes of the songs of Paradise!

   VII. Lastly, the highest idea of Heaven is that it is A PLACE OF MOST
   HALLOWED AND BLISSFUL COMMUNION. I have not given you even half that I
   might have told you of the various characteristics of Heaven as
   described in God's Word, but communion is the best. Communion! That
   word so little spoken of, so seldom understood. Blessed word,
   communion! Dearly-Beloved, you hear us say, "And the communion of the
   Holy Spirit be with you all," but there are many of you who do not know
   the meaning of that sweet Heaven in a word--communion! It is the flower
   of language! It is the honeycomb of words--communion! You like to talk
   of corruption best, do you not? Well, if you like that ugly word, you
   are very willing to meditate upon it. I do so when I am forced to do
   it, but communion seems to me to be a far sweeter word than that! You
   like to talk a great deal about affliction, do you not? Well, if you
   love that black word--you may have reason to love it--and if you care
   to be happy about it, you may do so. But give me for my constant text
   and for my constant joy, communion, and I will not choose which kind of
   communion it shall be!

   Sweet Master, if You give me communion with You in Your sufferings. If
   I have to bear reproach and shame for Your name's sake, I will thank
   You if I may have fellowship with You in it! And if You will privilege
   me to suffer for Your sake, I will call it an honor, so that I can be a
   partaker of Your sufferings! And if You give me sweet enjoyments, if
   You raise me up and allow me to sit with You in heavenly places in
   Christ, I will bless You! I will bless God for
   ascension-communion--communion with Christ in His glories! Do you not
   say the same? And for communion with Christ in death--have you died
   unto the world, as Christ died unto it? Then have you had communion
   with Him in resurrection? Have you been raised to newness of life, even
   as He was raised from the grave? And have you had communion with Him in
   His ascension, so that you know yourself to be an heir to a throne in
   Glory? If so, you have had the best earnest you can receive of the joys
   of Paradise! To be in Heaven is to lean one's head upon the breast of
   Jesus--have you not done that on earth? Then you know what Heaven is!
   To be in Heaven is to talk to Jesus, to sit at His feet, to let our
   heart beat against His heart. If you have had that bliss on earth, you
   have already tasted some of the grapes of Heaven!

   Cherish, then, these foretastes of whatever kind they may have been in
   your individual case. Differently constituted, you will all look at
   Heaven in a different light. Keep your foretaste just as God gave it to
   you. He has given each of you a separate experience of it which is most
   suitable to your own condition. Treasure it up! Think much of it, but
   think more of your Master, for, remember, it is, "Christ in you, the
   hope of glory," that is your best foretaste of Heaven! And the more you
   realize that blessed Truth of God, the more fully prepared shall you be
   for the bliss of the joyous ones in the land of the happy!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GENESIS49.

   Verses 1-3. And Jacob called unto his sons and said, Gather yourselves
   together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
   days. Gather yourselves together and hear, you sons of Jacob; and
   hearken unto Israel your father. Reuben, you are my firstborn, my
   might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and
   the excellency of power. All this was to Reuben's advantage, yet he was
   spoiled through one fault.

   4. Unstable as water, you shall not excel So it is clear that the
   greatest strength and dignity and power will not serve a man so as to
   make him excel if he is unstable. There are many such persons still
   remaining in the world. Their doctrine changes like the moon and we
   never know what it is. Their spirit and temper constantly change. Their
   pursuits are sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another. They
   are, "everything by starts, and nothing long," and to each of them it
   may be said, "Unstable as water, you shall not excel."

   4-7. Because you went up to your father's bed, then defledit: he went
   up to my couch. Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty
   are in their habitations. O my soul, come not into their secret; into
   their assembly, my honor, be not united: for in their anger they slew a
   man and in their self-will they dug down a wall Cursed be their anger,
   for it was fierce; and their wrath, for if was cruel: I will divide
   them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel It is a very remarkable
   circumstance, well worthy of notice, that this curse was turned into a
   real blessing, especially in the case of the tribe of Levi. It is true
   that they were divided and scattered, like handfuls of salt, throughout
   the whole of Israel, for they were attendants upon the Lord's priests
   and they had cities appointed to them so that while they dwelled here,
   and there, and everywhere, it was in order that they might reach the
   whole of the people and prove a blessing to them. Are any of you
   laboring under a very serious disadvantage? Does it look to you like a
   curse? Then pray to God to make it into a blessing! I believe that
   often the worst thing that can happen to Christian men is really the
   best thing, for, while Nature would cry out, "The clouds are to be
   dreaded," Grace can reply--

   "The clouds you so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In
   blessings on your head."

   8. Judah, you are he whom your brethren shall praise. His name was
   praise and such was his history to be, for David came of that tribe,
   and great David's greater Son, whom it is our joy to praise!

   8. Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's
   children shall bow do wn before you. While that was true of Judah, it
   is still more true of Him who sprang out of Judah, even our Lord and
   King, the Lion of the tribe of Judah!

   9. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he
   stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion, who shall rouse
   him? Our Lord overcame His enemies even in the thicket of this world.
   And all power is given unto Him now that He has "gone up" again into
   His Glory. Let that man beware who would attack this Lion of the tribe
   of Judah--"Who shall rouse Him?" If you persecute His followers, you
   will rouse Him. If you deny His Truth, trample on the Doctrine of
   Atonement and reject His love, you will rouse Him! But beware in that
   day, for terrible is the King of Judah when He is once aroused!
   Therefore, submit yourselves to Him--"Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,
   and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little."

   10. The scepter shallnot depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
   his feet, untilShiloh comes and unto Him shall the gathering of the
   people be. When did the dominion depart from Judah till the Lord Jesus
   came as the Sent One? And unto Him, to this very day, the people gather
   and more and more shall gather in the latter days.

   11. 12. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
   choice wine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the
   blood of grapes: his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white
   with milk I t was literally so with Judah, but it is gloriously so with
   our Lord to this day. It was His blood which yielded the juice of those
   rare clusters of the choice vine and now, with garments dyed with His
   own blood, He comes from Edom, for He has trodden down His foes, and He
   cries, "I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was
   none with Me."

   13. Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an
   haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Sidon. So did Zebulun
   dwell even until the day when our Lord came, for Matthew writes
   concerning Him, "Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into
   prison, He departed into Galilee; and leaving Nazareth, He came and
   dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of
   Zebulun and Nephthalim: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
   Isaiah the Prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun, and the land of
   Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the
   Gentiles; the people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
   which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up."

   14, 15. Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: and
   he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed
   his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. This was a
   poor character for Issachar to possess. It was s tame-spirited tribe
   that loved rest and ease and, therefore, did not fight with the common
   foe. Issachar crouched down between the burdens instead of taking them
   up and bearing them! God grant that none of us may be of that lazy
   tribe! I think that I know some who are--they could do a great deal,
   but they see that rest is good and the land is pleasant--so they idle
   away their days.

   16, 17. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel Dan
   shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the
   horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. Dan is noted among
   the tribes for its famous leap, capturing that distant part of the
   country for itself. Here good old Jacob, worn out by what he had
   already said, exhausted by the ecstasy into which as a Prophet he had
   been cast, paused awhile and panted.

   18. I have waited for Your salvation, O LORD. But He soon resumed His
   prophecy--

   19. Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last
   Many of God's servants belong to this tribe, for their life is spent in
   conflict. They do not seek it, but it comes to them and, for a time,
   they seem to be overcome, yet let them clutch at the promise given to
   Gad.

   20. Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
   dainties. Well fed and then yielding correspondingly. There are some
   people who like to have their bread to be fat, but they yield to the
   King no dainties. Let it not be so with us, but let us both feed well
   and yield well.

   21. Naphtali is a hind let loose. The type of what a Christian minister
   should be--indeed, what every Christian worker should be--"a hind let
   loose," one who can say with David, "O Lord, truly I am Your servant. I
   am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid. You have loosed my
   bonds."

   21. He gives goodly words. He has liberty in speech, freedom of
   utterance. He is not in bonds, he is as "a hind let loose."

   22. Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well Where
   he can suck up abundant nutriment--

   22. Whose branches run over the wall. He does more than he is expected
   to do. Nothing seems to content him, his "branches run over the wall."

   23. 24. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated
   him: but his bow abode in strength. You know how sorely Joseph was
   persecuted by his brothers, yet how the Lord was with him in all his
   troubles. It appears from these words that he was, himself, an archer,
   and that he was not in a hurry to shoot his arrows--his bow remained
   still. It is the strong who can afford to be quiet. As you go across
   the village green, a goose will hiss at you, while the strong ox lies
   down calmly and takes no notice of you--"His bow abode in strength."

   24. And the arms of his hands. Not only his hands, but the arms of his
   hands--

   24-27. Were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob (from
   there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel) even by the God of your
   father, who shall help you; and by the Almighty, who shall bless you
   with blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lie under,
   blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: the blessings of your father
   have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors into the utmost
   bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph,
   and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his
   brethren. Benjamin is a ravenous wolf: in the morning he shall devour
   the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. Little Benjamin is
   the last of the tribes.

   28-33. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
   their father spoke onto them, and blessed them; everyone according to
   his blessing he blessed them. And he charged them, and said unto them,
   I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave
   that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in the cave that is in the
   field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which
   Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of
   a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife; there
   they buried Isaac and Rebecca, his wife; and there I buried Leah. The
   purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the
   children of Heth. And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his
   sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
   and was gathered unto his people. It is a very sweet thing to die with
   a blessing on your lips. And it is equally good to live in the same
   spirit. Our Lord Jesus was blessing His disciples when He was taken
   from them--and since we do not know when we shall be taken away from
   our relatives, let us be always blessing them. May the Lord, who has
   blessed us, make us a blessing to others!

"There Is No Difference"

   (No. 2608)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 28, 1883.

   "The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto ail and
   upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have
   sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Romans 3:22,23.

   THE Apostle here says that "there is no difference," yet he does not
   mean that all men are alike in all respects. There are very many and
   important variations among men. It would be quite untrue and unjust to
   say that there are no differences of character even among unregenerate
   men, for there certainly are many varieties and gradations of sinners.
   There are some who have, as it were, sold themselves to work iniquity,
   and there are others who have, apparently, kept the Commandments of God
   from their youth up. There are some who delight in all manner of evil
   and there are others who, though they are not converted, hate the very
   mention of all the grosser vices and steer clear of such impurity.
   There are some people, not yet on the Lord's side, who are like that
   rich young man of whom it is said that when Christ looked upon him, He
   loved him, for He saw much in him that was admirable. But, on the other
   hand, there are some who are manifestly sons of perdition, like Judas,
   of whom our Lord said that he was a devil. All men are not demons, or
   demoniacal. All are not equally hardened in heart. All do not go to the
   same excess of evil. So when Paul said, "There is no difference," he
   did not mean that there are no differences of outward character.

   Let us not be carried away with the idea that it does not matter what
   our outward character is--it matters a great deal! It shall be found,
   at the last, that the greatly guilty shall be greatly punished. "That
   servant who knew his lord's will and prepared not himself, neither did
   according to His will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that
   knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
   few stripes." God is not unjust! Even in taking vengeance upon His
   adversaries, He strictly observes justice at all times. It is for your
   good and for the good of those about you that you should be moral,
   temperate, chaste and honest--and God grant that you may be all that!

   There are, then, differences of character among men, and there are, no
   doubt, differences of disposition which show themselves very early.
   Some children appear from the very first to be tender and docile, while
   others manifest a passionate and rebellious disposition. All of us
   probably know some friends who are not yet converted, but they are
   amiable, loving, considerate, kind--they have almost everything we
   could wish except the one thing necessary--God grant that they may soon
   have that, also! Though as yet they are not brought to Christ's feet,
   they seem to have had a religious tendency from their very childhood
   and they delight to be found in the House of God and, at least
   externally, in the ways of God. even if their hearts are not, at
   present, renewed by Grace. There are, alas, others whose dispositions
   are the very reverse of all this--they seem disposed to everything that
   is bad. We have met with cases in godly families where young men, from
   the first moment in which they could have their liberty, have delighted
   to do that which at last broke their parents' hearts. They have seemed
   to be, from the very first, fickle, vain, fond of pleasure, proud,
   willful and wicked. Beyond all question, there are differences of
   disposition in different persons. And when Paul says, "There is no
   difference," he does not refer either to character or to disposition.

   There are also in men who, as yet, are not saved, differences as to
   their readiness to receive the Word of God. There are some who are like
   the "honest and good ground" which is already plowed and harrowed--all
   that is needed is the handful of good Seed--and as soon as it is sown,
   they will take it in and, in due time, yield a harvest in return.
   Others are like the stony-ground hearers--apparently ready and prepared
   for the good Seed. They seem to receive the Word with joy, but, as the
   hard rock underneath has never been broken up and there has been no
   subsoil plowing, nothing permanent results from their hearing the
   Gospel message. There are others, again, who are like the hard-trodden
   highway-- you may sow upon them as much seed as you like, but the only
   result will be to feed the birds. The fowls of the air will devour
   whatever is scattered upon them. May none of us be hearers of that
   sort!

   So you see, dear Friends, that there are great differences among men in
   certain respects. The Apostle is speaking in this passage about one
   thing--and you must not stretch his meaning beyond that. There is one
   point in which there is no difference and that is that, "all have
   sinned." All have forfeited every claim to personal righteousness! All
   must be made righteous by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ
   to them--and all who would have that righteousness must believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, for there is one way of salvation, and only one--and
   whatever other differences there may be, there is no difference about
   this matter! If we are saved at all, we must all be saved in one way.
   My discourse is to run upon these lines. First, let us enlarge upon the
   doctrine that, in the matter of the Gospel and of salvation, "There is
   no difference." Secondly, let us show its practical bearing upon
   ourselves. And then, thirdly, let us rejoice in the doctrine--let our
   hearts sing over it--for there is the raw material of many a holy song
   and Psalm within these few words, "There is no difference."

   I. First, then, LET US ENLARGE UPON THIS DOCTRINE and, in so doing, we
   will make four observations.

   The first is this--there is no difference as to the message of
   salvation which is to be delivered to men. It may be my privilege, at
   one time, to speak to a convocation of highly-intelligent well-educated
   men. If so, I am to preach to them the Gospel of salvation by faith in
   the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, it has
   often been a great joy to me to preach to assemblies which certainly
   were not composed of the learned and great, but were gathered from the
   lowest classes of the people. How glad I have been to preach to them!
   And I had exactly the same message to deliver to them as to the other
   congregation--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he
   that believes not shall be damned." If the true preacher of Christ were
   called to preach before a pit full of kings--as Napoleon once said to a
   noted singer, "If you will come to me, you shall sing before a pit full
   of kings"--if it were the preacher's business to address such an
   audience as that, he must preach nothing but, "Believe and live!" And
   if he were called to speak before an assembly of murderers about to
   die--the very scum of the earth--he could have no more suitable or
   appropriate message than this, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   you shall be saved." Go where you may, my dear Brothers, you need not
   puzzle your head about the sort of Gospel you are bound to preach. To
   the jailor at Philippi, to the Areopagites on Mars' Hill, to the
   Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, to Nero at Rome, to barbarian, Scythian, bond,
   or free--to the very chief of sinners, to the greatest or the least of
   mankind, you have to deliver but one message--"God has set forth His
   Son, Jesus Christ, to be the propitiation for sin, that whoever
   believes in Him should not perish, but should have everlasting life."
   This is the essence of the one message we have to deliver to all men!
   "There is no difference."

   And, next, there is no difference as to man's need of this Gospel.
   There are some, as we have already admitted, who have been preserved
   from gross vice, whose lives have been moral and upright, yet they have
   as much need of the Gospel as those who are confined in our jails, or
   those who flaunt their unchastity in our public streets. The Gospel
   comes to deal with sin--and if a man has but one sin, he cannot get rid
   of that one sin apart from the Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
   all men have not merely one sin, but many sins--they may not all be
   equally clear and manifest--some of them may be secret sins, but the
   secrecy of sin does not render it less sinful in the sight of God.
   There are no secrets from Him, He sees everything. And whether sin is
   open or covert, whether it is less or more than that of other men, it
   needs the atoning Sacrifice of Christ to remove it! The putting away of
   the sin of the most moral person who ever lived requires the
   propitiation of the Son of God. There is no bath that can take away a
   single stain of guilt except that--

   "Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins."

   All men have evil hearts, albeit their hearts may not all be equally
   inclined to the coarser vices in which some indulge, yet there is in
   every sinner the black spot of alienation from God, forgetfulness of
   God, love of sin and dislike to God when He is thoroughly known. And,
   to get this out of the heart requires a Divine operation in every case.
   No man can make his own heart clean. If it were possible for a man to
   change his arm or his foot, yet it would be clearly impossible for him
   to change his heart--that is so vital to himself that there cannot be a
   change there unless He that made all hearts should make that heart
   anew! To change the heart of the most amiable maiden requires the work
   of the Spirit of God as truly as to change the heart of the most
   debauched wretch that lives! It is no more possible for the honest man
   than for the practiced thief to make his heart right in the sight of
   God--it is equally impossible to either of them. Both cases are beyond
   human power and, therefore, the need of the work of the Spirit of God
   is the same. All of us, at this moment, either stand stripped naked
   before God, without a rag to cover us, or else we are wrapped in the
   glorious and resplendent righteousness of Jesus Christ. The need of the
   Gospel is the same to every individual in the world! Those who are
   elevated above their fellow creatures do not stand on high before
   God--the Queen needs the Grace of God to save her just as much as the
   poorest of her subjects. "There is no difference" as to the need of
   salvation.

   Next, this declaration is equally true as to the method of salvation.
   The way in which men are saved is the same in every case. "There is no
   difference." They do not all feel the same terrors, they do not all
   experience, to the same extent, the common joys. Each path is peculiar
   in some respects, yet there is but one road, and that is the narrow way
   that leads to eternal life. The plan of salvation is this--that we
   confess and acknowledge that our own righteousness is but filthy rags,
   that there is nothing in us that can merit anything of God. And, next,
   that we apprehend that the Lord has put His dear Son into our place,
   has laid on Him our sin and struck Him with the strokes that ought to
   have fallen upon us. He, on His part, willingly became our Surety and
   Substitute. We must believe this if we would be saved. That being done,
   we must accept what Christ has endured as being borne for us--and trust
   in it with our whole hearts. We must, in fact, change places with
   Christ--let Him stand, as He did stand, and be reckoned as the sinner,
   that we might stand here and be looked upon by God as if we had been
   like His Son--perfectly righteous and without sin. He clothes Himself
   in our rags and He puts on us His royal robes! Faith appropriates to
   itself the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ and so is clothed
   with what is called in our text, "the righteousness of God."

   God's plan of salvation is a grand one and there is no other that can
   be of use to anybody in the whole world. This is the one way of
   life--that you acknowledge yourself to be nothing and take Christ to be
   your All-in-All--that you, with your sin and misery, by a simple act of
   faith, take to yourself Christ to be your righteousness and your
   strength--and, this being done, you are accepted in the Beloved, for
   now is it true of you that the righteousness of God, which is by faith
   in Jesus Christ, is unto you and upon you seeing that you have believed
   in Him. "There is no difference," then, about the method of salvation.

   Once more, there is no difference as to the efficacy of the plan of
   salvation. This man believed in Jesus Christ and was saved. So shall
   that other man be if he believes in Jesus Christ. All who believe in
   Christ are justified from all things. All who trust in Christ have
   eternal life and shall never perish. The blood of Jesus was never yet
   applied to a conscience without giving it peace. A persecutor is washed
   and his crimson stains are gone. A thief believes and he is, that day,
   with Christ in Paradise! Mary Magdalene believes and seven devils are
   cast out of her. A rough Philippian jailor believes and that night he
   is baptized, rejoicing in God with all his house. Never sinner yet did
   try this blessed remedy and find it fail! And none ever shall, for
   "there is no difference."

   II. Now, in the second place, I want to TURN THIS TRUTH TO PRACTICAL
   ACCOUNT by showing its bearing upon us.

   My first observation is what a leveler this doctrine is for pride!There
   is self-righteousness up there as a crown upon your forehead--it will
   have to come down, my Friend. You are covered with the beautiful
   garments of your own good deeds--take them off, Brothers and
   Sisters--take them off! They are all without merit in the sight of God
   until you have trusted His Son. All that you have done and all that you
   think you have done are only as so many cobwebs that must be swept
   away. There stands the gate through which the most fallen may
   enter--and you must go through the same gate. There is no private path
   made for a gentleman like you. There is no royal road to Heaven save
   only that one royal road which is opened for the very chief of sinners.
   Down, Mr. Pride! Here is a man who is born of Christian parents and,
   perhaps, he has listened to the lying logic of the present age which
   says, "Children born of godly parents do not need conversion--there is
   something good in them by nature." I tell you, Sirs, that I begin to
   tremble for the children of pious parents, for I think that they are
   more likely to be deceived than any others! They often fancy that they
   are converted when they are not and they get admitted into churches
   while they are unconverted. They are not like those who can see a great
   change in themselves through being taken right out of gross sin--they
   are very apt to be deceived and have need to be very careful lest they
   should make a fatal and eternal mistake. Instead of boasting of their
   godly ancestry, high privilege as it is, let them remember that
   regeneration is not of blood, nor of birth, nor of the will of man, but
   of God. And to them, as to all others, Christ's words apply, "You must
   be born again."

   There are some who imagine that they can get to Heaven by some special
   staircase because they are people of rank. Oh, believe me, Sir John,
   you will have to be saved in the same way as your groom, or not at all!
   Ah, my lord, everybody bows to you, but you must bow to Christ! You
   must be saved in the same way as the carpenter, the blacksmith and the
   chimney-sweep, or not at all. There are no two ways to Heaven! Jesus
   says, "I am the Way." There is no other way for your lordship, or your
   ladyship, in spite of your rank. There is a wealthy man who thinks that
   everything is to be bought, if he can find the price--but you cannot
   buy Heaven, Sir. The very stones of the street are of pure gold--you
   could not buy one of them, you have not enough money! Your wealth goes
   for nothing in the matter of salvation. You must be saved in the same
   way as the poorest of the poor. The pauper who was born in a workhouse
   and has never left it, has the same way of salvation as you have, for,
   "there is no difference" of any sort, whatever, with regard to birth,
   or rank, or wealth.

   But someone says, "I am a man of great abilities, a man of education,
   culture and learning." I am very glad to hear of it, my dear Sir. But
   do you expect the Lord is going to make a way of salvation by
   competitive examination as when people enter the Civil Service? Is
   there to be a special way of salvation for you Masters of Arts or
   Doctors of Divinity? It is not so! The Lord knew that the great bulk of
   people would be nothing of this sort, so He made a Gospel which is
   adapted to the poor--but is just as suitable for all. Those who are
   illiterate can, nevertheless, understand the way of salvation by faith
   in Christ and so they are saved and, my dear Sir, you will have to be
   saved in the same way, or else you will never get to Heaven. I have
   heard of a king of Sweden who, when he lay dying, had a bishop to pray
   with him. And when the bishop had finished his prayer, the king said,
   "Somehow I have derived no comfort from that prayer. I remember once
   hearing a shepherd pray in a hut when I had lost my way--will you send
   for him?" They did so, and when the shepherd poured out his heart in
   his own simple language, then the king saw the Light of God and died
   rejoicing! "There is no difference"--the king and the shepherd need the
   same Savior--and must go to Heaven by the same royal road. This
   doctrine dethrones pride, but that is not all that it does.

   Further, it is a great uplifter of those who are troubled with fears.
   "Oh," says one, "I am such a great sinner! I feel that I am the
   greatest sinner who ever lived." Ah, my dear Friend, but "there is no
   difference." You will enter Heaven at the same gate through which great
   saints go in if you do but trust the Lord Jesus Christ, for that is
   what they have to do and so they are saved, and so shall you be! I
   think that I hear another say, "But I find such evil in my very nature.
   I have such a hard heart. I cannot feel, I cannot love the Lord as I
   want to." Yes, I know all about it and I am very sorry for you, but, my
   dear Friend, "there is no difference." You believe that there are some
   Christians who are very tender of spirit, but the Lord had to make them
   tender--and He can make you tender. The same Lord that saves little
   children and that brought a young Josiah and an open-hearted Lydia to
   His feet, can bring you, also, for there is really no difference. It
   needed a Divine work in their case and it needs the same in yours. "I
   am very poor," says one. Yes, but, "there is no difference," blessed be
   God! You hardly know where you are going to sleep tonight, but I can
   tell you where you may rest, not only tonight, but all your days--that
   is, in Christ Jesus--if you come and put your trust in Him! He does not
   look to see whether you have a suit of broadcloth or a suit of fustian!
   "There is no difference" with regard to that matter.

   "But I am so ignorant," says one, "I cannot even read." I am very sorry
   for you and I think that you ought to try and learn. At the same time,
   there is many a man who can read his title clear to a mansion in the
   skies who does not know A from B! It does not need that you be a
   scholar in the schools of men to become a scholar in the school of
   Christ, but, just as you are, trust your soul in His hands and He will
   teach you all that is essential to be known, for in this matter, "there
   is no difference." I thought I heard someone say, very indistinctly,
   "Ah, Sir, but I am so old!" Yes, yes, and I think I hear a little boy
   or girl over yonder say, "But, Sir, I am so young!" Well, come along,
   both of you! Give me your hand, old Friend, and give me yours, dear
   child, for "there is no difference" between the oldest and the youngest
   as to this way of salvation! The child believes and is saved! And the
   old man believes with a childlike faith and is saved, too!

   My text also has a practical bearing in another direction, it helps to
   meet singularity of disposition. There are many persons in the world
   who believe that they are different from everybody else. I always
   sympathize very heartily with them because I know that I am, myself, a
   very odd body, a lot out of all catalogs, I often say, and so are you.
   You think there never was another like you! Perhaps you think it is a
   pity that there should be and very likely that is true. You are all by
   yourself, you say. Well, just listen to me, for my text can set you
   right--God grant that it may! After all, "there is no difference."
   Come, you strange Jack--you singular Mary--you that seem to be the odd
   bird in the nest--there is, after all, no difference! Your heart is
   evil, your life has been sinful--so has my life been, and so is it with
   all those round about you! And there is only one way of salvation for
   you odd people and for all you even people as well! There is not
   anybody that is so cut on the cross, so strange and so altogether out
   of harmony with the rest of mankind that he may say, "God left me out
   of His calculations." No, there is really no difference whatever
   between you and others in this matter of salvation!

   I must make yet one more practical use of my text and that is, to
   encourage you who labor for Christ. Where are you going to serve the
   Master, my Brother? "Oh," you reply, "I have a very tough bit of ground
   to till. I teach in a Ragged School on Stint Street and I visit the
   lodging houses." Another says, "I am trying to do something for Christ
   in Bethnal Green." Well, Friend, I reckon that I have about as hard a
   field of labor as you have. "Oh," you say, "but these look like very
   respectable people." Yes, they look so, but if you could read their
   hearts, you would see that they are uncommonly like those people on
   Stint Street and Bethnal Green among whom you are working. "As in
   water, face answers to face, so the heart of man to man." We all belong
   to the same race. There is but one blood in all of us. There is the
   same tendency to sin and the same need of a Savior for these
   respectable-looking folk as there is for the very roughest and the very
   dirtiest of mankind!

   I think I hear another say, "I am going to Africa as a missionary and I
   am sometimes afraid as to how I shall get on with the unenlightened
   people there." Another says, "I am going to India and I do not know how
   I shall succeed with those learned Brahmins." Another says, "I am going
   to China. I cannot hope to see many converted among those who are so
   devoted to Confucianism." Why not? "There is no difference." After all,
   it is the same sort of soil which we all have to plow either at home or
   abroad. There may be a slight contrast on the surface, but it all needs
   the same kind of plowing, the same sort of sowing and the same Divine
   power to cause the seed to grow! The gate of salvation is just as
   widely open to men in China as it is to you who have long been sitting
   under the sound of the Word. At bottom, "there is no difference"
   between man and man--they are all sinners, they are all depraved. "They
   are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;
   there is none that does good, no, not one." I believe that it takes as
   much Grace to save an Englishman as it does to save a Hottentot. The
   Grace operates, too, in much the same way. The experience of the two
   men, when it is related, may sound different because of the varying
   measure of knowledge of the parties concerned, yet the essential items
   of all true Christian experience will be found to be the same in every
   case. Do not, therefore, say, dear Brother, "I shall not go to that
   place! It is such a difficult place." I have a notion that such a spot
   as that is the very best place to which anyone can go. "But there are
   such crowds of people there." All the better! It is good fishing where
   there are plenty of fish. "But, oh, they are so wild!" Just so. But if
   I were ever to go hunting, I would not hunt poor timid hares, I would
   like to go after lions, tigers, bears and wolves--there is excitement
   in such sport as that!

   And if you go in for soul-winning, do not be picking and choosing which
   souls you will try to win. The worse the region is, the more it needs
   the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I think that if I were a lamp and I could
   have my choice as to where I would be hung, I should not wish to be in
   one of the fine streets where there were plenty of other lamps, but I
   should like to go down some wretched court where there was no lamp at
   all, where the people break one another's heads and steal one another's
   goods in the dark, for I should be of more use there! So, dear Friends,
   be willing to go where you can be of most use! And wherever your sphere
   of service is, do not be discouraged, for over all men there hangs this
   motto, "There is no difference." They have all to be saved in the same
   way and the Omnipotence that can save one will abundantly suffice for
   the salvation of another!

   III. Now, in closing my discourse, I want to spend a minute or two in
   bidding you REJOICE OVER THIS GREAT

   TRUTH.

   I rejoice over the fact that there is no difference, in the matters of
   which I have been speaking, concerning the whole human race. I saw a
   picture of the Tower of Babel by an eminent painter. All the various
   races of mankind were represented as going off in different directions,
   some to the North, others to the South, to the West, or to the East,
   all being scattered over the face of the whole earth. It was a painful
   sight to see the great family broken up, never, as far as we could see,
   to be reunited again. But, dear Friends, hear how this text collects
   the whole family of mankind into one and gathers all these scattered
   ears of corn and makes one sheaf of them--"There is no difference." All
   men are fallen through sin, but whoever, out of them all, believes in
   Jesus Christ, shall have eternal life! There is one blessed bath of
   salvation in which all may be washed whiter than snow! There is one
   remedy, and only one, for the disease of sin--and all who apply to the
   great Physician are healed forever. I love to see the human race thus
   reunited.

   But there is something better than that. What glory it is to the Lord
   Jesus Christ that He should be the only Savior and that faith in Him
   should be the only way of salvation! I feel sure that we do not wish
   the Lord Jesus Christ to be put into competition with someone else in
   His work as our Savior. No, we want our Lord to have the monopoly in
   this matter and He has it! None can be saved except by faith in Him, by
   the application of His precious blood, glory be to His holy name! I
   feel a very peculiar joy over this Truth of God. I was thinking, as I
   came along to this service, "Suppose I had to preach a different gospel
   for every man?" There is a little book entitled, Every man his own
   lawyer. Well, nowadays, according to some people, it seems as if every
   man is to be his own savior! But if I had, say, a dozen gospels, and I
   had to sort them out and give the right gospel to the right man, what a
   fix I would be in! I believe that, oftentimes, I should be giving your
   gospel to someone else and someone else's gospel to you--and what a
   muddle it would all be! But now we have one universal cure! We have a
   Divine catholicon. The blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ will
   save every man who trusts Him, for "there is no difference."

   Wherever Christ is received, there shall be salvation. This makes it
   easy work for the preacher and what a blessing it is to you who are
   Believers, for, suppose you had to say, "Well, I have believed in
   such-and-such a salvation," but somebody might say, "That will not save
   you! You are a No. 2 man and you need No. 2 gospel, not No. 1." Suppose
   you should lay hold of that and one of these days your conscience
   should say to you, "No. 2 is not the medicine that you need, you ought
   to have No. 6." Suppose that it ran up to No. 14, No. 17, or No. 20?
   Why, when you lay dying, you might say, "I have taken the remedy No. 1,
   but I am afraid that I am a No.20 man. I took this one and it did give
   me some kind of relief, but I am afraid that I took the wrong
   medicine." But now it is one medicine for every disease--one Christ for
   every sinner--one blood with which to wash us--one salvation with which
   to rescue us--one righteousness with which to cover us! Therefore, such
   doubts as I have just mentioned can never come into the minds of those
   who believe in Jesus--blessed be God for that!

   And so to you, dear Hearers, who are seeking after Christ, is it not a
   great mercy that there is but one name whereby you can be saved?
   Otherwise the same awkward occurrence might happen to you and you would
   be saying, "At which door am I to go in?" You might get to the wrong
   entrance and the man in charge of it might say, "This is not the door
   for you. You have come to the wrong one, you must go to No. 6, or 7, or
   8." How puzzled we are when we go to Clap-ham Junction, or some such
   railway station, to know which staircase we are to go up--and a poor
   sinner would be much in the same kind of worry to know which way he was
   to be saved. But when it is just this, "Believe and be saved; look and
   live; trust yourself to Christ, rest in His atoning Sacrifice and you
   are saved"--all can understand it!

   When God gives us, by His Spirit, a simple faith in Jesus, we at once
   receive eternal life--and every soul that believes in Jesus Christ has
   that life. I pray God to bless this message to you who are still
   unsaved. Quarrel not with your only hope of salvation! Accept what God
   provides! Yield yourselves to the Divine decree, for God has decreed
   that no soul shall enter Heaven but by His Son, "the Way, the Truth and
   the Life." This name--this one name--you must rely on if you would be
   saved! This way--this one way--you must run in if you would enter
   Heaven! God help you to enter it at once, for our Lord Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS3.

   Verses 1, 2. What advantage, then, has the Jew? Or what profit is there
   in circumcision? Much every way; chief, because that unto them were
   committed the oracles of God. If it is so that, after all, no outward
   rite or birth privileges can bestow Grace, what advantage did the Jews
   possess? "Why," says Paul, "they had this very great privilege, 'that
   unto them were committed the oracles of God!'" It is no small blessing
   to have a Revelation from Jehovah and to have the means of knowing what
   that Revelation really is.

   3. For what if some did not believe?Many of the seed of Israel did not
   believe the Revelation that was made to them. Yet the privilege of
   hearing it was just as great, even though they slighted it.

   3-5. Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God
   forbid! Yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written,
   That You might be justified in Your sayings, and might overcome when
   You are judged. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness
   of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance?
   Vengeance on a sin which is nevertheless made to turn to His glory?

   5-7. (I speak as a man) God forbid: for then how shall God judge the
   world? For if the Truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto
   His glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?Yet I shall be. If God
   shall overrule my sin to His own glory, that will mate no difference to
   my responsibility. If I have lied, if I have done wrong in any way, I
   must be judged and condemned on that account, whatever may be the
   ultimate result of my sin.

   8. And not rather, (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm
   that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Whose damnation is
   just. If any man dares to say that, "Since God turns even evil into
   good, and by the forgiveness of sin brings glory to Himself, 'Let us do
   evil that good may come,'" he is twisting the Truth of God to his own
   destruction--and his "damnation is just."

   9. What then? Are we better than they? Are Jews better than Gentiles?
   Or, are Gentiles better than Jews?

   9. No, in no way, for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles,
   that they are all under sin. Nobody can read the first chapter of the
   Epistle to the Romans and follow it by reading the second, without
   seeing how completely Paul has proved "that they are all under sin."

   10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one. There is
   not, and there never has been, one of the human race, save our Lord,
   who also is God, who ever continued to live a righteous life! Adam
   began righteously, but how soon he fell! And all his descendants have
   both began and continued to be sinners. "There is none righteous, no,
   not one."

   11. There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.
   That is, none do so by nature--those who seek after God are ledto do so
   by a work of Grace upon their hearts. Otherwise, men are blind. They do
   not see the right path. They are willful and do not seek after God.

   12. They are all gone out of the way, they are all together become
   unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one. This is God's
   verdict upon the whole human race! He has the best opportunity of
   seeing them and He has the best capacity for judging them. And this is
   what He says of all men as they are by nature, "There is none that does
   good, no, not one."

   13. Their throat is an open sepulcher. A reeking mass of corruption!

   13. With their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is
   under their lips. They are pleased to say a bad word about their
   neighbor. They are eager to repeat any slander that they hear and they
   are not unwilling, even, to invent it, themselves!

   14, 15. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are
   swift to shed blood. And when, by fear of the laws of the land, they
   are prevented from carrying out their evil purposes, yet their anger
   is, itself, murder in intent-- and into what human heart has not that
   sin glanced?

   16-19. Destruction and misery are in their ways: and the way of peace
   have they not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. Now we
   know that whatever the Law says, it says to them who are under the Law.
   All these passages, which Paul has put together in this dreadful
   mosaic, are taken from the Old Testament, so they apply to the Jews.
   And he had already proven, in the first Chapter, the intolerable vice
   of the Gentiles, so that now he has shown that both Jews and Gentiles
   are guilty.

   19. That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
   guilty before God. The 19th Century world, as well as the world of the
   1st Century--all the world, in all time, has "become guilty before
   God."

   20. Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shallno flesh be justified
   in His sight. Talk not, therefore, of righteousness by your own works!
   Dream not of meriting eternal life by any attempt to keep the Law of
   God, for this is the declaration of God's Holy Spirit, "By the deeds of
   the Law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight."

   20. For by the Law is the knowledge of sin. The Law is a mirror--you
   see your spots as you gaze into it. But no man ever washed his face in
   a mirror--it shows the spots, but it cannot remove them! The Law of God
   is the indicator and the revealer of sin, but it has no power whatever
   to put away sin.

   21-24. But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested,
   being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; even the righteousness of
   God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
   believe: for there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come
   short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His Grace through
   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. That is a very wonderful verse,
   every word of it is full of meaning. "Justified"--that is, accounted
   just, made to be righteous in the sight of God. "Justified
   freely"--without any merit or purchase money. "Freely by His
   Grace"--not an act of justice, but an act of mercy has made sinners
   just in the sight of God! "Through the redemption"--there is the
   foundation of it all--we are redeemed by precious blood. "Through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus.'"

   25-27. Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His
   blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are
   past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time
   His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him
   which believes in Jesus. Where is boasting, then?Boasting is sure to be
   somewhere handy, ready to creep in if it can, for we are all prone to
   it--it is the common sin of our race! "Where is boasting, then?"

   27. It is excluded. By what law?\t is shut out! But by what law is it
   shut out?

   27. Of works?No, for whenever we think that we have been performing any
   good works, we at once begin to boast.

   27. No, but by the law of faith. For if we are saved by believing, if
   we are justified freely by God's Grace through the redemption that is
   in Christ Jesus, then there is no room for boasting.

   28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
   deeds of the Law. "We conclude"--we are shut up to this belief, "that a
   man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law."

   29. Is He the God of the Jews only?Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes,
   of the Gentiles also. He saved Abraham by faith, and he saves us by
   faith. The same saving principle is applicable to all parts of the
   human race.

   30. 31. Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
   faith, and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the Law
   through faith?Some will be sure to say so, but it is not true.

   31. God forbid! Yes, we establish the Law. There is no one who so much
   loves the Law of God and delights in it after the inward man, as the
   one who is justified by faith! There is nothing that so honors the Law
   of God as "the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ." It
   establishes forever the Law, even as Christ said to His disciples,
   "Think not that I am come to destroy the Law, or the Prophets: I am not
   come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven
   and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
   Law, till all is fulfilled."

Our Thoughts About God's Thoughts

   (No. 2609)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 1, 1883.

   "How precious also aire Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the
   sum of them!If I should count them, they are more in number than the
   sand: when I awake, I am still with You." Psalm 139:17,18.

   This Psalm dilates upon the Omniscience of God. In the most forcible
   manner, it shows that God's eyes have always rested upon us and are
   resting upon us now. We are here made to see that God knew all about us
   before we were born, that He now reads our most secret thoughts and
   that our unspoken words are all known to Him. And I want you to notice
   that the Psalm is not at all in that mournful strain in which we
   sometimes speak of the Omniscience of God. It is a very solemn thing
   that God should be everywhere. "You God see me," is a note of the most
   serious kind when sounded in the sinner's ear, but, to those who are
   the people of God, there is nothing dreadful in the thought that God
   sees us. There is nothing to cause us to despond or to make us feel
   gloomy in the fact that God compasses our path and our lying down. In
   fact, in proportion as we are fully reconciled to God, love Him and
   rejoice in Him, it will become a cause ofjoy to reflect that our best
   Friend is never away from us--that our Protector's hand is never
   removed, that the great observant eyes of Divine Love are never closed!

   Oh, dear Friends, could we ever go to any place where God is not to be
   found, that would be the Hell of hells to His people! And if there
   could be a period in which the Lord did not look upon us, we might say,
   "Let that day be blotted out from the calendar." It is a joy, a bliss,
   a foretaste of Heaven to know that--

   "Wherever we seek Him, He is found" and even when we are not seeking
   Him, yet still He is above, beneath and all around us! He is never far
   from any of us. May we all have the Grace that will enable us to
   rejoice in a present God! We may judge as to our position before God by
   this test--is the thought of His constant observation of us a subject
   ofjoy or of dread? If we dread it, surely we have the old spirit of
   bondage still upon us! But if we rejoice in it, then we may know that
   we have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."

   I am going to try to speak, as God shall help me, first, upon God's
   thoughts of us. "How precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God!
   How great is the sum of them!" Then, secondly, I want to say a little
   upon our thoughts about God's thoughts. His thoughts become precious to
   us as we think about them. Then, thirdly, I wish to speak at somewhat
   greater length concerning our thoughts upon God Himself. "When I awake,
   I am still with You."

   I. First, then, let us meditate for a little while upon GOD'S THOUGHTS
   OF US.

   That the infinite Jehovah thinks of us is absolutely certain. He thinks
   about all the inhabitants of the whole world. There is a general
   Providence which has a superintendence over all that happens in all
   parts of the earth. I know that the notion of some men is that the
   world is like a watch and that God has done with it as we do with our
   watches--that is, wound it up, put it under His pillow and gone to
   sleep. But it is not so, for in this great world-watch--to keep up the
   figure--God is present with every wheel and every cog of every
   wheel--there is no action in it apart from His present putting forth of
   power to make it move. There is nothing that happens merely as the
   result of, "law," as some people seem to dream, for a law is nothing
   without a forceat the back of it! When we speak of certain things as
   being governed by law, we simply mean that as far as we have discerned,
   that is the general way in which this particular thing moves, or is
   acted upon, or acts upon some other thing. But, then, where is the
   force that enables it to act so, or that makes it to be so acted upon?
   "That is gravitation," says one. Yes, that is your name for that force,
   but it is really God who is everywhere at work! Though the law of
   gravitation may be said to be abiding, yet the force of gravity is but
   the force which proceeds from God. It is God still putting forth His
   power and operating after His own manner upon material substances.

   God, therefore, thinks upon the whole world--and I am glad that it is
   so! I do not like the idea of being put out to nurse, as it were, and
   left without my Heavenly Father's personal supervision. I like to be in
   a world that is really God's garden, a part of His own homestead in
   which He dwells and where I am always directly under the glance of His
   eyes. Rivers unknown to song, far distant from civilization, are
   nevertheless homely places to one who has learned to be at home with
   God.

   Now, as God thinks and must think of the whole material universe which
   He has created, much more does He think of men and most of all of us
   who are His own chosen people, to whom He stands in a very peculiar
   relationship as our Father, who has "begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." God must think
   of us--the blood would not flow in our veins, nor would the breath make
   our lungs to heave, nor would our various bodily processes go on
   without the perpetual exercise of His power. God must think of us
   especially in all the higher departments of our being, for they would
   speedily come to nothing apart from His constant care. There would be
   none of the spirit of prayer if He did not work it in us. There would
   be no spirit of sonship if the Holy Spirit did not teach us continually
   to cry, "Abba, Father." Faith and hope and love are plants that only
   live in the sunlight of God. And if the great Father of Lights
   withdrew, all these would die. "Without Me you can do nothing," is as
   certainly true of us who are His people, as of those who are far from
   Him by wicked worlds. We must be united to God, or else we shall perish
   and, therefore, as we know that we shall never perish, we are quite
   sure that our Heavenly Father thinks of us. Think of all the gracious
   influences that meet in your person to perpetuate your life--I mean,
   your spirituallife--your holiness, your comfort, your joy. Think of all
   the purposes of God that center in you in order that, by them, you may
   be made perfect and so be fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of
   the saints in light. Think of these things, I say, and you will at once
   see that for the grand design which God has concerning you, it is
   absolutely essential that He should think of you--and He does think of
   you!

   Next, God's thoughts of us must be very numerous. According to our text
   the sum of them is very great--how great, the Psalmist does not say.
   The number of God's thoughts is so vast that even if you could count
   the sand on the seashores, you could not count the thoughts of God
   concerning you! Oh, how important this makes us poor creatures, when we
   remember that God thinks of us! I would like you to sit still a minute
   and think over this wonderful Truth of God. You know that people are
   very proud if a king has merely looked at them. I have heard of a man
   who used to boast, all his life, that King George IV-- such a beauty as
   he was!--once spoke to him. He only said, "Get out of the road," but it
   was a king who said it, so the man felt greatly gratified thereby. But
   you and I, Beloved, can rejoice that God, before whom kings are as
   grasshoppers, actually thinks of us and thinks of us often. One or two
   thoughts would not suffice for our many needs--if He only thought of us
   now and then, what would we do in the meantime? But he thinks of us
   constantly! He says that He has engraved our names upon the palms of
   His hands, as if to show how continually we are before Him. David said,
   "I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks upon me." And our Savior said
   to His disciples, "Your Father knows what things you have need of
   before you ask Him," proving that He had thought about them and had
   looked upon them with careful eyes and observed all their necessities.
   Yes, God does in very deed and of a truth think upon His people--and
   His thoughts concerning them are very numerous!

   And they are also very tender God never thinks of His people in a harsh
   way. He never has an unkind thought concerning even the most erring of
   those who are His own children. He looks upon them as a father looks
   upon his child, with intense affection, pitying them when they stray
   from Him. And if, sometimes, He chides them for their wrongdoing, even
   then He does but veil the purpose of His love that He may accomplish it
   the better. He is always aiming at that which will promote our best
   health, our truest wealth and our ultimate perfection. At times, clouds
   come between our souls and our God, but His love is always shining. O
   Beloved, if the Lord had not thought very tenderly of us, He would have
   cut some of us down long ago as cumberers to the ground. "He has not
   dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities." How often He has screened us from trouble! How frequently
   He has prepared us for a trial, so that, when it came, it did not crush
   us! How often He has rescued us out of sore perils! How often He has
   visited us in the night and given us songs amid our sorrow! "Your
   gentleness has made me great," said David, and many another child of
   God has said the same! There is nothing that can equal the tenderness
   of God towards us, His poor, frail and erring children.

   But while God's thoughts concerning us have been thus tender, they have
   also been very wise. To make a glass that should reflect without any
   color the object placed before it, was long the desire of those who
   made certain kinds of optical instruments. They worked a long time to
   no purpose, but, at last, someone discovered how to form an achromatic
   lens and then, lo and behold, when this man had thought out his plan
   perfectly in all its details, he was able to make a glass which was
   exactly like the eyes of an insect which I have often seen. So, when
   the man thought aright, he thought just as God thought and, after going
   a long way round about, when he did come to the right conclusion, he
   came just where God was. And, in like manner, if you and I were to try
   to work out the problem of our lives, and if we were wise enough to
   discover the best way in which we could get to Heaven, we would come
   exactly to the route which God has marked out for us and we would do
   with ourselves precisely what God does with us! Were we always wise, we
   would never murmur. Were we to be endowed with infinite wisdom, we
   would rejoice in the very things which now distress us--and the clouds
   and darkness which we now seek to avoid, we would willingly pass
   through if we did but see, as God sees, the end as well as the
   beginning! His thoughts are wise for the whole of our lives. He does
   not simply think how He shall make us happiest today, or how He should
   give us the most enjoyment for a week--that is how fond and foolish
   mothers think and plan for their boys. They make ducks of them--and
   they grow up geese. They indulge them and spoil them, but it is never
   so with God in His thoughts concerning the happiness of His children.
   He looks far ahead. He takes eternityinto the compass of His thoughts
   and He judges what is best to do for us, not merely under the aspect of
   an hour, or a week, or a month, or even of a whole life below, but He
   puts eternity into the scale and orders all things well for everlasting
   ages!

   You and I could not think like that, could we? We soon get puzzled with
   our little calculations and it is unwise for us to look too far ahead.
   If we begin considering 50 cares at once, they will prove to be too
   many for us. Our best way is to take them one by one and live by the
   day, or, better still, moment by moment. Such a course as that would
   not be wise for us if it were not that there is Another who, not living
   by the day, Himself, but filling all eternity, judges for us according
   to that blessed stanza of the Psalmist, "His mercy endures forever."

   These, then, are the thoughts of God concerning us--certain, numerous,
   tender and infinitely wise.

   And God's thoughts, too, are very practical. He does not think of us
   and let it end with thinking, but God's thoughts are really His acts,
   for, with Him, to will is to do. He utters His thought and, lo, it is
   accomplished! His fiat has achieved it. God might have thought much of
   us and the thought would have had no comfort in it if it had not moved
   His hand to succor and to help us. Think awhile of the practical
   thoughts of God for us in the eternity when He chose us before the
   daystar knew its place. Think of the Everlasting Covenant, ordered in
   all things and sure, made before the sun had shed a single ray of light
   upon the earth. Think especially of that part of the Covenant in which
   the Father made His Son to be our Covenant Head and gave Him to stand
   in our place as our Surety and Substitute. Oh, what a thought was
   that--how wonderfully practical--that God should take His Beloved Son
   from His bosom and give Him up to die that we might live! And, ever
   since, all along our history, God has thought of us. He thought of us
   when we were babes and we were nourished and cherished. He thought of
   us when we were children and we learned to lisp His name. He thought of
   us--

   "When, in the slippery paths of youth, With heedless haste we ran."

   He has thought of us since we have come to manhood. Yes, and in the
   case of many of us, He has thought of our children and of our
   children's children, too. And He is still thinking of us and He will
   continue to do so when our last thoughts die out in insensibility.
   Remember His ancient promise to His people--"Even to hoar hairs will I
   carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry and will
   deliver you." And we shall find it to be so! And each Believer may say,
   with David, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
   my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." These,
   then, are God's thoughts concerning us--constant, kind, wise, tender,
   gracious, perfect, Divine--like He in whose infinite mind they are
   found!

   II. Now let us meditate for just a few minutes upon OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT
   GOD'S THOUGHTS.

   What do you say, my Heart, to this wondrous Truth of God--that the Lord
   thinks upon you? I have been ready to say what would be a very fair
   translation of the Hebrew--"how rare are Your thoughts!" You know that
   the word, "rare," was used in a different sense in olden times from
   what it is now. In Westminster Abbey there is s stone with these words
   upon it, "O rare Ben Jonson!"--meaning strange, special, peculiar,
   marked. So the thoughts of God are rare thoughts, the like of which
   cannot be found anywhere else! The thoughts of angels, or the thoughts
   of perfect spirits above must be something very wonderful, but, oh, the
   thoughts of God! If I were told that some bright angel was sent to
   think of me all day and all night long, that he was my Master's servant
   to watch over me, I would feel pleasure in the thought, yet that would
   be a poor, poor thing compared with the fact that God thinks upon us
   and watches over us! The Lord told Moses that His angel would go before
   the people through the wilderness, but you may have noticed how Moses
   pleaded against such a decision--"If Your Presence go not with me,
   carry us not up hence." We do not need angelic presence one hundredth
   as much as we need the Divine Presence! Here, then, in God's thoughts
   concerning us, is something rare and wonderful, indeed! And this is our
   thought about it, that there is no other thought that can, for a
   moment, be compared with it!

   How delightful, too, it is to be thought upon by God! I have already
   said that to some people, the Truth that God is looking upon them wears
   an aspect of awe and dread. "Oh," says one, "is it not terrible to
   think that God's eyes are always upon me?" It is not terrible to me--I
   am right glad that it should be so, and I pray, with David, "'Search
   me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if
   there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.' You
   will see much that will grieve You and much that You will have to
   amend, but still, I would not wish to hide anything from You, my Lord.
   Lies not all my hope, my very Heaven, that way? The glances of Your
   eyes, are they not the very medicine that shall cure my soul-sickness,
   or, at least, the means by which I shall get the medicine that will
   heal me of the dire disease of sin?"

   It is even so, and the true child of God wishes to always get more and
   more closely under the inspection of his Heavenly Father--and the
   thoughts of God towards him charm and delight him. Does God in very
   deed think of me, from the moment when I wake in the morning, and all
   through the day, till I lock up my heart at night and give Him the key?
   Does He keep on thinking of me while I lie asleep, unable to think of
   anything except poor wandering thoughts that come in my dreams? If so,
   blessed be His name that He condescends to do anything of the kind!
   "How precious are Your thoughts unto me, O God!" How delightful is it
   to be thus thought of by You! And how consoling it is, also!

   We all like to be thought of and remembered. I went to call on one who
   was sorely sick. The doctor had said that he must see no one, but when
   his friends told him I was there, he exclaimed, "Oh, let him come up!"
   "No," they replied, "he must not, for it might excite you, and do you
   harm." "Give him my love, then," he said, "and tell him that it does me
   good to know that he is downstairs." We like to be thought of, I am
   sure that we do. Even the thoughts of a little child towards us have
   comfort in them. There is many a mother who is made a widow and she
   sits down to weep as if her heart must break. But when her little one
   plucks her skirt, ignorant of the sorrow which it will one day have to
   feel with the mother, and the mother hears the child's merry little
   note, it is often the best form of consolation that God sends to her
   bereaved spirit!

   We all like to be kindly remembered, but, oh, what is it to be thought
   of by God? "When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will
   take me up." And if men misrepresent us, and misinterpret us, and speak
   evil of us, and put us out of their company, what does it matter, as
   long as the Lord draws nearer to us than He did before? God's servants
   in Scotland had brave times among the heather when they had to watch
   for Claverhouse's dragoons and stood in jeopardy of their lives. The
   Lord was especially present among the lone crags and they heard His
   voice in the Psalm and then from above in the thunder! So near was the
   Lord to them in the dark days of persecution that afterwards, when
   peaceable times came and they could go to the kirk in quiet, there were
   some who looked with regret on those other days when they met at the
   peril of their lives and God was their Leader! So, God's thoughts are
   precious to us by way of consolation.

   They also have other effects upon us, for the thoughts of God often
   move the souls of Christians, strengthening them in faith, awakening
   them to love and stirring them to zeal. There is many a man who has
   done, under a sense of God's Presence, what he would never have dreamed
   of doing if he had not realized that the Lord was there. As the
   Highland chieftain, when he fell and was dying, said to the men of his
   clan, "I shall watch you, my children, as you rush to the fight," and
   so made them brave--when we think of God's watching us and of His eyes
   being upon us, we also become valiant and do exploits in His sight! And
   each one of us sings--

   "I can do all things, or can bear

   All sufferings, if my Lord is there!

   Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,

   While His left hand my head sustains." His Presence is all that our
   heart requires. Indeed, Beloved, when we really drink in the thoughts
   of God towards us, our spirit is filled with all that it needs and is
   borne onward as with a mighty rush--a full tide of Grace--up to the
   Throne of Heaven!

   III. Now I come to the last part of my discourse, OUR THOUGHTS UPON GOD
   HIMSELF. David says, here, "When I awake, I am still with You."

   I want you to notice, first, that he seems to imply that our thoughts
   bring us near to God. Thinking of Him, we realize that we are in His
   immediate Presence. I cannot describe the feeling of a spirit
   consciously present with God, but, though I cannot describe it, I am
   sure that many of you know what it is, and I am equally sure that I,
   also, know what it is. There have been times with us when we did not
   actually walk by sight but, still, we had a very joyful experience of
   God's Presence with us. We not only believed in God's existence, but
   our spirits seemed enveloped in and encompassed with His Spirit and
   appeared to be, as it were, set on fire, as when the bush in the desert
   was all aglow with the indwelling God. It is not always so with us, but
   we have had times of extremely conscious nearness to God. After prayer,
   as we rose from our knees and looked at the clock, we perceived that a
   full half-hour had gone, whereas we thought that it was only a minute
   or two that we had been at our devotions. In our chamber, alone, as we
   have read the Word, the sacred page has seemed to glow with unusual
   brilliance. We do not remember noticing such glory in those words,
   before, but God has spoken to us through the Word and that has made the
   difference.

   Sometimes, as we have been sitting in the sanctuary, a solemn awe has
   manifestly been on every heart. And when we went away, we said to one
   another, "Surely God was in that place, and we knew it." You know how
   Paul says about his rapturous experience, "Whether in the body, I
   cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows."
   Such things have happened to many of God's people and I believe that
   the more we live in Him, and walk with Him, the more often will this be
   our experience till it may even come to be perpetual, and our soul
   shall be as certain of the Presence of God as we are of the presence of
   our body. We shall get to have as keen a sense and recognition of the
   Presence of God with us as we have of the atmosphere which surrounds
   us. David's declaration, "When I awake, I am still with You," implies
   that holy thoughts of the precious thoughts of God place us near to
   God!

   And, next, it implies that these thoughts help to keep us near to God.
   ' 'When I awake, I am still with You," said David, as if he meant, "I
   have a long time been in Your company. I have been now by the week, the
   month, the year, abiding in the light of Your Countenance, enjoying
   Your sweet society. Your Grace has kept me near You."

   Still further, such thoughts help to restore God's Presence to us if,
   for a while, we have lost it. "When I awake"-- that means, "I have been
   asleep and so have lost the consciousness of God's Presence." Have you
   ever known what it is, at night, to be quite sorry to go to sleep
   because you have been so full of holy joy that you were afraid you
   might lose it while you were unconscious? Have you never lain awake
   thinking and meditating upon your God, enjoying His Presence so much
   that you have said, "This is better than sleep. I wish that my eyes
   might be kept wide awake that they might forget their need of rest,
   that I might continue this hallowed communion"? But with our poor frail
   frames we must sleep, so, is it not sweet that when you awake, you
   should be where you left off, that, as your soul was holding fellowship
   with God as you fell asleep, when you opened your eyes, again, He was
   still there? You were ready to take up the happy employment where you
   left off, for you had not broken the thread--and you went on still
   communing with your God!

   This text evidently refers in part to natural slumber. When our
   thoughts are much with God, then it will happen that our sleep will
   make no break in our communion with Him. Were you ever pained by a
   dream? I will hold no man responsible for his dreams, but, if there
   were no sin in us, we would have no sin even in our dreams. If we were
   perfectly pure-- as some think that they are--we would be perfectly
   pure even in our dreams. Take off the bridles from the horses, remove
   the bits from their mouths and let them go where they will, yet, if
   they are thoroughly trained, they will not rush wildly about and they
   will still obey your call. If a house is perfectly clean, it will be
   just as clean if you take all the locks off and leave the doors open.
   If a man is perfectly pure, he would be pure in any case and in any
   condition. Therefore, even a dream may sometimes set us watching to
   know how such mischief could get into our thoughts. It could not have
   come there if sin had not been dwelling in us. But, oh, it is blessed
   to get so near to God that when you fall asleep, you seem to hear, even
   in your dreams, the music of His voice! And when you wake in the
   morning, you will wish to recall those blessed thoughts that came to
   you even when your whole being seemed steeped in sleep! The text says,
   "When I awake, I am still with You." And I think that it also means,
   "When I wake up from any temporary lethargy into which I may have
   fallen, I am still with You." We all, sometimes, get into that
   state--sleeping, though our heart is awake. We wish to be more brisk,
   more lively--but we cannot stir ourselves up. We sing--

   "Dear Lord! And shall we always lie

   At this poor dying rate?"

   We have fallen into a kind of stupor. What a blessing it is to be
   awakened out of it, possibly by a severe affliction, perhaps by an
   earnest discourse! Then the awakened one says, "Now I have come back to
   You, my God. There was a something within me that could not forget You,
   even for a while, though it lay still and dormant."

   And, best of all, what a grand thing it will be, one of these days, to
   go upstairs for the last time and stretch ourselves on the bed and say,
   "Adieu! Adieu!" to all we love below--and then put our head back on the
   pillow while those who are watching say, "He sleeps in Jesus!" "I shall
   be satisfied when I awake with Your likeness." "'When I awake, I am
   still with You.' I trusted You when I fell asleep and in the morning I
   awoke to find You still my Friend."

   Then, when my body wastes from its long sleep in the tomb, every rising
   bone of it shall acknowledge the Lord! My eyes shall see Him in that
   day--the God that loved me and died for me! Oh, how blessed it is to
   keep the whole heart so fixed upon God that come sleep, come life, come
   death, come what may, we shall be just like the needle in the compass
   which always turns to the pole! You may turn it around, if you like,
   but it always goes back and will not point anywhere but in that one
   direction. May it also be true of you and me that we can rest nowhere
   but in our God! I close my discourse, as I have often done before, with
   that sweet verse--

   "All that remains for me

   Is but to love and sing,

   And wait until the angels come

   To bear me to the King."

   I wish that all of you knew this blessed experience of which I have
   been speaking. Some of you do not. You are afraid of God. You are
   afraid of His seeing you. You are afraid to go to Him. See, then, here
   is Jesus Christ who took upon Him our nature though He is God! Go to
   Him, trust Him, believe in Him--then He will make you to be a child of
   God and you will not be afraid of your Father. God bless you, for
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM139.

   May the all-seeing God, of whom this Psalm speaks, look down upon us
   and bless us richly while we read it! Verse 1. O LORD You have searched
   me, and known me.' 'Known me perfectly, far better than I know myself.
   You have made an inquisition and investigated every secret thing
   concerning me. 'You have searched me, and known me.'"

   2. You know my sitting down and my rising up, You understand my
   thoughts afar off' 'Before I think it, while as yet it is not actually
   my thought, while it is still unformed and far away, You understand it.
   You not only know what it is, but You understand it--the motive from
   which it springs, the state of mind out of which it arises, and
   whereunto it tends--'You understand my thought afar off"

   3. You compass my path. "You are all round me--behind, before, above,
   beneath"--

   "Awake, asleep, at home, abroad, I am surrounded still with God." 3.
   And my lying down. "When wearied by my journey I lie down to rest, You
   still bless my lying down."

   3. And are acquainted with all my ways.' 'I cannot tell you anything
   which You do not know; nor can I hide anything from You. Whatever I
   have done, or am doing, or shall do, 'You are acquainted with all my
   ways.'"

   4. For there is not a wordin my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it
   altogether--

   "He knows the words I mean to speak,

   Ere from my opening lips they break."

   God sees the word that is lying quietly on the tongue as well as the
   word which has been uttered by the tongue. "You know it altogether."
   God's knowledge is not partial or imperfect. He never misjudges any,
   for He is acquainted with every part of every man.

   5. You have beset me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me.
   "You have come so near me that You touch me. You not only know my
   thoughts and my words, but You come into contact with me. You know me
   as I know a thing when I feel it with my hand--'You have laid Your hand
   upon me.'"

   6. 7. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
   attain unto it Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Not that David
   desired to go away from God, but he wished to show the impossibility of
   escaping from the eyes of God. "Where shall I go from Your Spirit?"

   7. Or Where shall I flee from Your Presence?' 'You are everywhere and
   Your far-seeing eyes will behold me in every place. Vain is it,
   therefore, for me to think that I can ever flee from Your Presence." Is
   it not a very striking thought that every sin is committed in the
   Presence of God? He must be a very bold rebel who would insult his
   monarch to his face! Men are generally on their best behavior when they
   stand upon the palace floor--yet the whole earth is but the habitation
   of the great King eternal, immortal, invisible--and every time we sin,
   we sin in His very Presence, and with His eyes resting upon us.

   8-10. If I ascend up into Heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in
   Hell, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the morning, and
   dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Your hand
   lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me Well did Dr. Watts write--

   "If mounted on a morning ray

   I fly beyond the western sea,

   Your swifter hand would first arrive,

   And there arrest your fugitive." There is no hope of escaping from God
   by any speed to which we may attain, for if we could fly with the speed
   of light, yet would Jehovah be before us--His hand would lead as, and
   His right hand would hold us.

   11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall
   be light about me. It shall be light to the eyes of God, for He depends
   not upon the light in order that He may see. Light is a most welcome
   aid to our poor eyes, but God sees just as well in the dark! "Even the
   night shall be light about me."

   12. Yes, the darkness hides not from You; but the night shines as the
   day: the darkness and the light are both alike to You. This is a very
   commonplace Truth of God and yet how seldom do men realize it! They
   still fancy that when the night comes on and they are not perceived by
   mortal eyes, they may do what they will. But there is no curtain in the
   night that can hide a deed of guilt from the eyes of the Omniscient
   Jehovah! "The darkness and the light are both alike to

   You."--

   "Almighty God, Your piercing eyes Strike through the shades of night
   And our most secret actions lie All open to Your sight."

   13. For You have possessed my reins. "The innermost parts of my
   being--You have possessed them as Your own. You know as much about them
   as a man knows of the rooms in his own house. 'You have possessed my
   reins.'"

   13, 14. You have coveredme in my mother's womb. I willpraise You. That
   is a very sweet thing for the Psalmist to say. Just when he felt
   stricken with awe by reason of this august attribute of the Omniscience
   of Jehovah, he looks up to his God and says, "I will praise You."

   14. For I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Anyone who understands
   anatomy will tell you that man is strangely formed. So fearfully are we
   made that our life stands in constant jeopardy--it looks as if every
   breath might be our last and every pulse might speedily end our life.
   You cannot examine a blood vessel--especially some of the very small
   one through a microscope without being utterly astonished. Any medical
   man will tell you that there are many times in an hour--perhaps even in
   a minute--in which a very simple thing would put our life in imminent
   peril of destruction! Truly we are "fearfully and wonderfully made."--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs,

   And dies if one is gone!

   Strange, that a harp of thousand strings

   Should stay in tune so long!"

   Every man is a world of wonders. He need not go abroad for miracles,
   for he is, himself, a marvelous and miraculous combination!

   14. Marvelous are Your works; and that my soul knows right well How
   there can be a compound of spirit and matter--how the earth on which we
   tread should enter into our composition and yet we should be akin to
   angels. How there can be something about us that links us with the
   dust, yet much about us that joins us to God, Himself--these are
   extraordinary things which we do not understand Where is the point in
   which the spirit touches materialism? How is it that the will can move
   the hand or the finger? How does spirit act on matter? Those are
   questions much more easily asked than answered.

   15. My substance was not hid from You, when I was made in secret, and
   curiously made. Embroidered, as it were, with a needle. So
   extraordinary is the body of man that it may be compared to the
   needlework of God--"curiously made."

   15, 16. In the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes did see my
   substance, yet being imperfect And in Your book all my members mere
   written. Just as an architect sketches his plan for a building and
   specifies so much of this and that, so the Psalmist represents God as
   writing down in a book all the members of our body.

   16. Which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of
   them. God mapped out what He intended that we should be even when as
   yet we were not in existence! And from our earliest days He cared for
   us. If we look back upon our infancy--that considerable period of life
   in which we were utterly helpless and could do nothing whatever for
   ourselves--it ought to check our unbelief, because, if God took charge
   of us, then, and found means for our protection and our growing up when
   we were but little babes, if we should live to a second infancy, we may
   fairly trust that God will take care of us again! And if we should
   ever, through sickness, be reduced to such a helpless state that we can
   do nothing for ourselves, yet He that cared for us before we saw the
   Light of God, and when we saw it with feeble trembling eyes, will take
   care of us still!

   17-19. How precious, also, are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great
   is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number
   than the sand: when I awake, I am still with You. Surely You will slay
   the wicked, O God. It must be so! God cannot let sinners continue to
   live and provoke Him to His face. He must, one day, take down the sword
   of Justice, unsheathe it, and slay the foes of righteousness! "Surely
   You will slay the wicked, O God."

   19. Depart from me, therefore, you bloody men.''Get away, lest, when He
   comes to kill you, I should have to see you die."

   20-22. For they speak against You wickedly, and Your enemies take Your
   name in vain. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate You? And am not I
   grieved with those that rise up against You? I hate them with perfect
   hatred: I count them my enemies. We are to love our own enemies, but we
   are not to love God's enemies! We are to forgive our personal enemies,
   but we cannot forgive God's enemies! That man loves not the Truth of
   God who does not hate a lie and he loves not the right who has no anger
   against wrong. We are living in an age in which we are practically told
   that truth and error are the same, that the devil's lie and the Divine
   Revelation may lie down together! If we will not endorse this lie, men
   call us bigoted or dogmatic. Bless the Lord, we mean to be a great deal
   more dogmatic than we have been, and to stick even closer to the Truth
   of God than we have up to now done, if that is possible!

   23, 24. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
   thoughts: and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in Your
   way everlasting. That is a blessed prayer! May God hear it in the case
   of each one of us, for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

A Witness and a Partaker

   (No. 2610)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 4, 1883.

   "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a
   witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory
   that shall be revealed." 1 Peter 5:1.

   KINDLY notice, dear Friends, the Apostle's great gentleness. Peter was
   not always thus gentle, but the Spirit of God had rested upon him and
   now he writes with much tenderness. He does not say, "As an Apostle, I
   command," but, "As an elder, I exhort." It is always well to combine
   the suaviter in modo with the fortiter in re, that is, suavity in our
   method blended with strength in the thing, itself. There are some who
   are very blustering in their style of speech and there are others who,
   if they do not bluster, yet in the smallest matter always put forth
   their greatest force, or what they think to be so. They command and
   rebuke with all authority--yet here is Peter, who certainly was not a
   whit behind the very chief of the Apostles--and he speaks, not by way
   of command, but, addressing the elders, he tenderly exhorts them. Oh,
   that we may always manifest such a meek and gentle spirit--not drive
   men, but draw them to Christ--not terrify and threaten, but entice and
   woo to the Savior those to whom we are speaking or writing!

   Next, notice Peter's humility. "The elders which are among you I
   exhort, who am also an elder." He was an elder, most truly, as are all
   those who, in word and doctrine, feed the flock of God and who, at
   Christ's command, take the oversight of the souls of men. But Peter was
   much more than an elder, he was an Apostle. There were but few Apostles
   and those who were called to that high dignity were greatly
   favored--yet Peter does not mention his higher office, but, with true
   humility, he puts himself on a level with his Brothers. "The elders
   which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder." My Brother, if God
   has given to you extraordinary talent, do not exalt yourself on that
   account. If others willingly follow your leadership and you have the
   privilege of rendering to the Lord greater service than they can give,
   what have you that you have not received? And should not the chief
   among the saints be the servant of all? Is not he really the highest in
   Christ's esteem who is willing to be counted the lowest? Therefore, let
   no man exalt himself, or think highly of himself, for this he ought not
   to do. We admire in Peter--the once headstrong, impetuous Peter--the
   gentleness blended with humility which leads him to say, "The elders
   which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder."

   At the same time, let us especially note the wisdom of Peter, for it
   would have been an unwise thing for him to speak to the elders as an
   Apostle, for they might have replied to him, "You do not know the worry
   and toil and trouble of our service. You labor in a higher sphere. You,
   sitting on the Apostolic benches, are far above us. We, poor plain
   elders, cannot hope to attain to such eminence as yours." "No, my
   Brothers," says Peter, "I am one of you, for I, also, am an elder and,
   as a brother speaks to brother, so I exhort you. Knowing all your
   travail of heart and all your hard service in the cause of the Master,
   I, sympathizing with you, and altogether one with you, speak from my
   heart to your heart. Exhorting you, the elders, I, who am also an
   elder, say to you, Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
   oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
   lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage,
   but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall
   appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away."

   It will always be our wisdom, dear Friends, to put ourselves as much as
   we can into the position of those whom we address. It is a pity for
   anyone ever to seem to preach downto people--it is always better to be
   as nearly as possible on the same level as they are. Paul knew this
   and, therefore, he became "all things to all men." To the Jew, he was a
   Jew. Among Gentiles, he was a Gentile, for it so happened that he
   belonged to both classes. He was one with all men, barbarian, Scythian,
   bond or free. If he had to argue with the learned upon Mars' Hill, he
   could be a match for them. If he had to speak with the rough and
   illiterate, he threw out all beauty of language and talked to them in
   the plainest style. And you and I, if we want to win men to Christ,
   must act after the same wise fashion. Dear Sunday school teachers,
   would you be the means of blessing to the children under your charge?
   Then, be yourselves, children! Keep a child's heart throbbing beneath a
   manly breast. If you are a mother, go to the girls in your class as
   though you were still a girl, yourself, and you shall soon find the key
   of their heart and enter into the innermost chambers of their spirit. A
   true man welcomes a fellow man--he sees that he is a member of the
   great family of mankind and he says to him, "Come in." But if you, in
   your majestic greatness, speak to me like Jupiter thundering from a
   cloud, I shall not be likely to regard you. Or, if I do regard you,
   your message will be forgotten in the grandeur and glory of yourself!
   This is what never ought to happen, my Brothers--that people should
   think of us and forget our message Let us belittle ourselves that we
   may magnify our God. Let the Truth of God be borne before us like a
   shield! And though we are the Lord's armor bearers, let us hide behind
   the great shield which we lift up before the eyes of men. "'The elders
   which are among you I exhort'--not as Peter, the head of the College of
   Apostles--but as one who is a fellow elder with you." Therein, we see
   Peter's gentleness, humility and wisdom combined--and we shall be wise
   if we imitate him in all those respects.

   With this introduction, I now come to speak of the two great offices
   which Peter said that he filled. I cannot help calling them great, yet
   they are open to you and to me--and I hope that, by God's Grace, we
   have also, in our measure, been what Peter said that he was--"A witness
   of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that
   shall be revealed."

   I. First, then, let us think of Peter as "A WITNESS OF THE SUFFERINGS
   OF CHRIST." And, as far as possible, let us be witnesses with him.

   Peter was what we have not been, an eyewitness of the suffering of
   Christ. He actually and in very deed saw our Divine Master in His
   terrible griefs. Peter could never forget that he saw the Lord Jesus in
   His agony in the Garden. He was one of the three disciples who failed
   to watch with their Lord even for one hour and who, for very sorrow,
   fell asleep within a stone's cast of the place where Christ was
   "exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death." Peter remembered how, when
   the Master rose from prayer, and said, "He is at hand that does betray
   Me," he was there and saw the traitor imprint that cruel kiss upon the
   cheek of Him who still called him, friend. Peter was, about that time,
   drawing his sword and cutting off the ear of Malchus--and he could not
   fail to remember the look upon his Master's face when he who had eaten
   bread with Him did lift up his heel against Him, and the Son of Man was
   betrayed with a kiss from the apostate Apostle. Peter was also an
   eyewitness of our Lord's being hurried away to the bar of Annas where
   He underwent His preliminary examination. He remembered seeing one
   strike Him on the mouth. He could recall how they charged Him with
   blasphemy. He could remember how, after the first examination was over,
   Annas sent Him, bound, to Caiaphas. Peter was in the palace of Annas,
   warming himself by the fire, so he was an eyewitness of all that
   transpired. I do not quite know how far that witnessing went, for the
   time came when he denied his Master, but he could never forget that
   gaze of concentrated agony and pity when Jesus looked at him--not so
   much reproachfully, perhaps, as mournfully--feeling in His own soul
   that sorrow which He knew that Peter must, before long, feel. A spark
   from the torch of the Savior's anguish set the heart of Peter on fire
   and he went out and wept bitterly.

   I believe--I cannot help believing--that Peter rallied, by-and-by, from
   his fit of cowardice and that he came to the front, again, and saw the
   Master in Pilate's judgment hall. You know the story of our Savior's
   griefs and woes and I think that Peter and others of the Apostles were
   eyewitnesses of His sufferings. They saw Him after He had been
   scourged. They marked Him after He had been despised, flouted and
   mocked. They saw Him as the Cross-Bearer and heard Him say," Daughters
   of Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but weep for yourselves, and for your
   children." They watched Him as He went in awful anguish along the Via
   Dolorosa t o the Mount of Crucifixion. And they stood and saw Him
   nailed to the tree, to die there, like a felon, with no relief or
   succor, for God Himself forsook Him. And the bitterest pain of all was
   that He had to cry," My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
   Possibly, Peter saw it all. Certainly he was an eyewitness of Christ's
   sufferings and, I think, when he was writing to these elders, he seemed
   to say to them, "Feed the flock of God, for I saw the Great Shepherd
   when He bought that flock. I was there when He purchased the sheep with
   His own blood. And, after He had risen from the dead, three times He
   said to me, 'Simon, son of Jonas, Do you love Me?' And when I answered,
   ''Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You," He said to me,'
   Feed My lambs. Shepherd My sheep. Feed My sheep.' Therefore, O my
   Brethren, by His agony and bloody sweat, by His Cross and passion, by
   His precious death and burial, by His glorious resurrection and
   ascension, I beseech you, 'feed the flock of God which He has purchased
   with Jesus' own blood.'" I see great force in this exhortation by the
   eyewitness who is writing to his fellow elders.

   But, dear Brothers and Sisters, you and I, never having seen Christ in
   His sufferings, might never have had a participation in this part of
   our text if there had not been another kind of witnessing, namely, the
   faith-witness. I do not place this second in importance, though I put
   it second in order, for, indeed, it is of the very greatest importance.
   There were thousands who were eyewitnesses of our Lord's sufferings
   who, nevertheless, saw not the true meaning of them. They saw the dear
   Sufferer besmeared with His own blood, but into His wounds they never
   looked by faith. Thousands saw the Savior die, but they simply went
   their way back to Jerusalem, some of them beating on their breasts, but
   none of them believing in Him, or really knowing the secret of that
   wondrous death. I trust that I am addressing many who could be grouped
   together as faith-witnesses of the sufferings of Christ. Speaking for
   myself, I remember well when my sins, like an intolerable burden,
   crushed me down. I dared not look up and I never would have been able
   to look up, or to speak to anyone of the joy which is now within my
   bosom if I had not, by faith, seen--

   "One hanging on a tree, In agonies and blood, Who fixed His languid
   eyes on me As near His Cross I stood. Sure never till my latest breath
   Can I forget that look! It seemed to charge me with His death, Though
   not a word He spoke. A second look He gave, which said, 'I f-eely all
   forgive. This blood is for your ransom paid, I die, that you may live.

   Then I saw not only that Christ Jesus died upon the Cross, but I also
   perceived who He was and why He died--and what He accomplished by that
   death. I was helped to learn that He "loved me and gave Himself for
   me." I understood that He took my place that I might take His
   place--that He took my sin that I might take His righteousness--that He
   bore my woe that I might share His joy. And when I saw that--I do
   notmean when I heard about it--I do notmean when I read of it--but when
   I saw it with my soul's inner eyes and not only understood it, but
   perceived my share in my Savior's Sacrifice, and believed in Him to the
   saving of my soul, oh, it was a blessed day for me! Many of you, dear
   Friends, know well what I mean, for you also had just such a sight as I
   have described. You were faith-witnesses of Christ's sufferings! With
   some of us, many days have passed since we had that first sight of our
   suffering Lord, yet that sight has been often renewed to us. Sitting at
   the Communion Table I have seen it most clearly--the bread and the wine
   have set forth Christ's broken body and poured out blood--and my soul
   has realized within herself His Godhead and His Manhood, His perfection
   and His grief, His sinlessness and yet His sin-bearing, His suretyship
   and the way He smarted for it. And it has been a great joy to see it,
   and to be able to sing--

   "He bore on the tree the sentence for me, And now both the Surety and
   sinner are free"-- for Jesus redeemed us completely and effectually
   when He died upon the Cross. Many of you, Beloved, have been in like
   manner, faith-witnesses of Christ's sufferings.

   There are some who depreciate this faith-witness, but, Sirs, it is
   faith that saves! You may be an eyewitness and yet perish as Judas did.
   You may be an eyewitness and yet be lost as Pilate was. You may be an
   eyewitness and still hate Christ as Caiaphas did. But if you become a
   faith-witness, then shall you be included among those of whom it is
   written, "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they
   shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in
   bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."
   Such a faith-view begets repentance, hope and love--and brings
   salvation to every soul that has it!

   Peter, then, was an eyewitness, but, better still, he was a
   faith-witness. And this being the case, he went on to be a testifying
   witness. If a man sees anything happen, he is a witness of it. But he
   is more manifestly a witness when he comes and says that he saw
   it--when he appears in court and bears a public testimony concerning
   it. I judge that the principal business of any minister of Christ, or
   of any elder of the Church of Christ, is to bear testimony to the
   sufferings of Christ. If the atoning sufferings of Christ are left out
   of a ministry, that ministry is worthless. "The blood is the life
   thereof," is as true about sermons as it is about animals and
   sacrifices. A bloodless gospel, a gospel without the Atonement, is a
   gospel of devils and not the Gospel of God. Many are laboring hard,
   till their oars bend, to get away from the Gospel of Jesus Christ--I
   mean hundreds of so-called ministers of Christ--but in proportion as
   they forsake the Gospel, they cease to be what they pretend to be. They
   are not the ministers of God, or of His Christ! They are not
   ambassadors telling of reconciliation to men if in their teaching the
   sufferings of Christ are hazy and their cause and motive and objective
   are obscured. It is the glory of some of us that whatever else we bear
   witness to, we certainly are witnesses of the sufferings of Christ. We
   declare to men that there is no hope for them but in Christ who died!
   We testify to them that we have, ourselves, exercised faith in His
   death and have, thereby, received eternal life! We tell them that we
   know that what we say is true--we are as sure of it as was that
   disciple who, when he saw the blood and water flowing from Christ's
   side, bore witness to it, and added--"He knows that what he says is
   true, that you might believe." These things are not like dreams to us,
   they are part of our very being! We have believed in the blood and
   righteousness of Jesus Christ and our troubled conscience has therein
   found peace. Our soul has been filled with all the fullness of God and,
   therefore, we are and must be witnesses to the sufferings of the
   crucified Son of God, to the reality of the Atonement that He made on
   the Cross and to the effect of that Atonement upon the heart and
   conscience of all those who receive it.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, this is not only the minister's work,
   but it is your work, too. We are all to be constantly bearing our
   witness to Christ and saying, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away
   the sin of the world." You know what the people said of John the
   Baptist when he was dead--it is a kind of epitaph which any one of us
   might be glad to have put on our tombstone--"John did no miracle, but
   all things that John spoke of this Man were true." He had no great
   talents. He was not noted for His eloquence. He was not s man of
   commanding presence. He had no recondite knowledge. He had no profound
   logical power, but all that he said concerning Christ was true! I would
   like to have John the Baptist's epitaph as my own and I would be glad
   for you to have it, too--that in life and death we might be known as
   true witnesses to the sufferings of Christ, the power of which we have
   felt in our own souls.

   There is one other view of this witness-bearing, and that is that Peter
   was, to a very large extent, a partaking witness in the sufferings of
   Christ. He does not say so in our text, but in the 13th verse of the
   fourth Chapter he wrote, "Rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of
   Christ's sufferings." And he could write like that because of what he
   had, himself, endured for Christ's sake. He had been mocked, despised,
   persecuted. His life had been sought and he knew that he would have to
   suffer a painful death, for His Master had said to him, "When you shall
   be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you,
   and carry you where you would not." Putting all these things together,
   Peter could truly say that he was a witness of Christ's sufferings
   because he had, in a measure, participated in them.

   I hope I am addressing some who can also say--though to a far smaller
   degree than could the saints of old--"Yes, for Christ's sake we have
   been accounted fools. We have been reckoned among those who have not
   the courage to advance with the times. We have been willing to be
   mocked in the workshop, or in the pulpit, or wherever our lot has been
   cast among men. And we would cheerfully have borne far more if it had
   been imposed upon us." As the persecuted Believer looks up to his Lord,
   he can truthfully say--

   "If on my face for Your dear name, Shame and reproaches be, All hail
   reproach, and welcome shame, If You remember me."

   Thus you see how Peter was a witness of the sufferings of Jesus Christ.
   May each of us be appointed to the same high and honorable position!

   II. The second thing which Peter says of himself is, perhaps, more
   remarkable than the first. He says that he was 'A PARTAKER OF THE GLORY
   THAT SHALL BE REVEALED.

   I like to see that word, "partaker," coming after the word, "witness,"
   for I do not think that any man can really be a useful witness for
   Christ unless he is a partaker. Can you go and talk to others about the
   bitterness of sin when you have never wept over it or repented of it,
   yourself? Can you speak of the sweets of Divine mercy of which you have
   never tasted? Will you magnify "precious faith" when you are, yourself,
   a stranger to the faith of God's elect? Will you set forth Christ,
   evidently crucified among men, when you have never seen Him, yourself?
   Can you describe the love which has never cheered your own heart? Will
   you tell of communion with Christ when you know nothing of its
   blessedness? Unhappy man! Your office would be, indeed, terrible if you
   were called to such a work! It were better for you to perform the most
   menial labor with the most grievous sweat and wear and tear of your
   very marrow and bones, than have to occupy a pulpit to talk of things
   which you have never tasted, handled and felt yourself. I would sooner
   not exist than be a preacher of the Truths of God which I had never
   believed in my own soul! The old writers used to speak of men who
   served in the shambles and butchers' shops and who saw and handled and
   sold the meat, but who, themselves, died of hunger. And they spoke of
   wretched folk who prepared dainties for their fellow men, but who did
   not, as they expressed it, get so much as a lick of their own fingers,
   but died of famine while they were feasting others.

   Oh horrible, horrible, must it be to be sick unto death and yet to be
   selling medicines that will heal! Oh, dreadful must it be to be
   hammering away building an ark, as Noah's carpenters did, and yet never
   to enter it, but to die in the deluge while the ship which you helped
   to build bears others over the wild waste of waters! Get home,
   minister! Tear off your gown and lay aside the very name that makes you
   appear to be a servant of God! Get down on your knees and cry, "God be
   merciful to me, a sinner, and forgive me for ever having dared to
   assume an office whose duties I could not fulfill! For how can I, who
   am blind, be the guide of others? And how shall I, who am spiritually
   deaf and dumb, make others hear? And how shall I tell of God and of His
   Covenant, and of His Grace, while I know not God experimentally and
   have no evidence that I am in the Covenant and have never tasted of His
   Grace?" That is right, Brother--you are getting on the right lines--if
   you would be a witness, you must first be a partaker! And you who teach
   in the Sunday school, you who preach at the street corners, you who go
   from house to house with your tracts--whoever you are who profess to be
   witnesses for Christ, take care that you are both witnesses and
   partakers. Join the two together--you cannot witness if you do not
   partake, or if you witness and do not partake, you only witness to your
   own condemnation!

   Very strangely, Peter here writes of himself as "a partaker of the
   glory." Did he mean that he was on the holy Mount of Transfiguration
   and saw the splendor of that sight when Christ was all aglow with a
   white light which gathered up all brightness and beauty into its
   solitary ray? Was he thinking of that memorable scene? I know not. It
   may have flitted across his mind but, in this passage, he says that he
   is "a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed." Not the glory that
   had been revealed, but that shall be revealed. Is that possible? Can a
   man be a partaker of a glory that, as yet, is not revealed?

   I answer that he may, first, by the closeness of his union with the
   glorified Christ. If I am, by faith, indissolubly one with Christ, then
   in His Glory I am glorified. On His Throne I am enthroned. By His
   victory I am "more than conqueror." If we are one with Him, then we are
   raised up together with Him and made to sit together with Him in the
   heavenly places. Oh, it is grand when a Believer does not so much think
   of himself as himself, but as part and parcel of his Lord! This is a
   very high attainment, yet Peter had reached it--and if you are vitally
   joined to Christ, you may reach it, too. If you have been, indeed,
   planted with Him in the likeness of Hs death, you shall also share the
   likeness of His resurrection--and you even now share it with Him, for
   as He is, so are you in this world! Was He humbled? Every saint
   underwent humiliation in Christ. Is He glorified? All His elect are
   virtually glorified in the glorification of their Covenant Head. It is
   indeed a blessed thing to know your union with Christ so completely
   that you are made "a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed" as
   far as you are personally concerned, but which is already revealed to
   Christ and, therefore, is already yours.

   I am sure that Peter also means that he had become a partaker of this
   glory to be revealed by the absolute certainty which he felt in his own
   soul that he should be ultimately, in very deed, a partaker of it When
   a man knows that he has such-and-such a possession in reversion, if he
   is very poor, he discounts it and begins to live upon its present
   worth. It is a very blessed thing when a child of God knows that
   because he is in Christ by faith, therefore, whatever things God has
   laid up for His people in general, He has laid up for him in
   particular! Whatever Christ has prepared for His redeemed, He has
   prepared for this redeemed one. Often his faith does, as it were,
   appropriate the future glory, and cry, "It is mine." The Believer
   begins to glorify God for it, though as yet he has not actually
   partaken of it, for faith brings him the substance of things hoped for,
   and is to him the evidence of things not seen. Brothers and Sisters,
   the next best thing to being actually in Heaven is to be assured that
   you will be there, and also to have this thought at the back of the
   assur-ance--that you may be there within the next five minutes! Oh, how
   speedily may you and I be in Glory! Before the clock ticks again, I may
   see the face of the King in His beauty, in the land that is very far
   off, in some respects, but very near in others. You know how John
   Newton puts it--

   "In vain my fancy strives to paint

   The moment after death,

   The glories that surround the saint,

   When yielding up his breath.

   One gentle sigh the fetter breaks--

   We scarce can say, 'They're gone!'

   Before the willing spirit takes

   Her mansion near the Throne." Well, since this glory is certain and may
   be so near, let us sit down and look at the golden gates--look until we
   see them--until they seem to come nearer and nearer and nearer, until
   the vision becomes so vivid that it ceases to be a vision and we are
   actually where we were thinking that we should soon be! It has so
   happened to many a child of God. There is one whom God favored with
   great wealth and to whom a friend said, "What a paradise this lovely
   garden is!" "Yes," he replied, "and I bless God for the assurance that,
   when I leave it, I shall go from one paradise to another and a better
   one." Some have said to a poor Christian, "What an ill-furnished place
   your room is! How scanty are your worldly goods!" "Ah," the man, has
   answered, "but I have enough to last me till I get Home, for I have the
   promise that bread shall be given me, water shall be sure and then I
   shall have Heaven to crown it all." When we have faith like that, then
   are we partakers of the Glory that shall be revealed!

   There is a step even beyond this when we advance from faith to positive
   enjoyment. There is such a thing as anticipating the glory to be
   revealedwith such a full, realizing faith that we begin to enjoy it
   even now! Surely, you have, at times, sat down with your fellow
   Believers, when the Word has been preached in the demonstration of the
   Spirit, and you have said, "Well, Heaven must be glorious, indeed, to
   be any better than this! My soul is all ablaze with love to Christ and
   even while my poor body is lingering here--

   "My heart is with Him on His Throne,

   And ill can brook delay.

   Each moment listening for the voice,

   'Rise up, and come away.'"

   And when the service has been over, you have said, "My soul was like
   the chariots of Amminadib--whether I was in the body or out the body, I
   could not tell." On your bed, sometimes, or in the chamber of sickness,
   or sitting alone in quiet meditation after you have been enraptured
   with a vision of your Lord, has it not seemed as if God had taken some
   dainty dish from off the table of the angels and passed it down to His
   waiting child below? Have you not heard stray notes of which you could
   almost say, "I am persuaded that is the angels' song"? And sweet sounds
   have reached your ears, like the music of "harpers harping with their
   harps," making you impatient of your exile here, but, at the same time,
   making you unspeakably happy until you shall be called up to join in
   the grand chorus of the Church of God above! "Unto Him that loved us,
   and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and
   priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever
   and ever!"

   Yes, Beloved, Peter could truly say that he was a partaker of the Glory
   yet to be revealed. I have no doubt that, sometimes, when he preached
   the Word, his soul was all aglow with holy fervor. I know that, often,
   I have been so graciously helped by the Holy Spirit to uplift my Lord
   and Master from this platform, that I have not wanted to go up those
   stairs any more. I would have liked to just finish up my discourse and
   say, "Amen," on earth, and at once begin to sing the everlasting song
   above! Have not you, dear Friend, also reached that blessed state? I am
   sure that Peter was often in that condition. And when he was
   persecuted, despised, imprisoned and his own brethren cast him out,
   there was often within his own bosom a company of the angels of God,
   Christ's sacred host--a very Mahanaim--and, still better, there was the
   Prince of Princes, the Angel of the Covenant, the Lord and Master of
   all the angels, speaking deep bliss into His servant's soul and filling
   him with unspeakable joy and glory!

   Now, my Brother or my Sister, if you get that Presence of Christ--and I
   pray that you may--you will be qualified to be a witness for Christ.
   People will say, "What makes those eyes so bright? What causes that man
   to be so happy? What is it that produces that calm, quiet spirit in the
   house? How is it that that man is not troubled as others are? He does
   not seem to have much cause for joy, but he is very serene and placid
   in spirit." They will perhaps say to you, "What is the secret of it
   all?" Then you will have an opportunity of saying, "I am a witness of
   Christ's sufferings, but I am also a partaker of the Glory that shall
   be revealed." Come with me, in thought, to Calvary, that you may learn
   the meaning of His sufferings, that you may afterwards be taught how
   you may share His Glory.

   I wish I could speak right to the very soul of some of you who do not
   know my Master--how I wish you did know Him! I cannot imagine what some
   of you have to comfort you which you can, for even a moment, compare
   with the bliss of knowing my Lord! I have seen your joys. I know
   something of what mirth can do and what relief laughter may be able to
   bring, but I also know that these things are of little use in the time
   of sickness, or when one is near death. It is just at such times that
   true joy in Christ becomes more deep, more sweet than ever! The less
   there is of the creature, the more room is there for the Creator. The
   more of suffering and sorrow we have to endure, the more of content and
   bliss can we enjoy. And oftentimes, when the body is weak and the head
   is aching, and the soul is faint, there is, as it were, a sweet swoon
   of Divine delight which comes over the spirit, which has more strength
   in it than strength, more joy in it than joy, and almost as much of
   Heaven in it as there is in Heaven! May you know this, for the sake of
   Him who has loved us and given Himself for us! God bless you all! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 CORINTHIANS 1.

   I am going to speak about the testimony of the Apostle Peter concerning
   his Lord, but we will first read together part of the writings of his
   "Beloved brother Paul," that we may see how these eminent servants of
   Christ agreed in their witness-bearing.

   Verses 1-3. Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the
   will of God, andSosthenes our brother, unto the church of God which is
   at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
   saints, with all that in everyplace call upon the name of Jesus Christ
   our Lord, both theirs and ours: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God
   our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ So this is a message to us,
   also, who "call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord."

   4-9. I thank my God always on your behalf, for the Grace of God which
   is given you by Jesus Christ; that in everything we are enriched by
   Him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of
   Christ was confirmed in you: so that you come behind in no gift;
   waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also confirm
   you unto the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord
   Jesus Christ God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the
   fellowship ofHis Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Paul was going to blame
   them for some things that were not right, but he began by commending
   whatever good was in them by God's Grace.

   10-12. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no
   divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the
   same mind and in the same judgment For it has been declared to me of
   you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there
   are contentions among you. Now this I say, that everyone of you says, I
   am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ So that,
   at the least, there were four parties in that one little Church which
   ought to have been knit together in unbroken harmony! This is only one
   instance of what has happened hundreds of times since. These
   Corinthians had a great many speaking Brothers among them and they held
   services in which it was open to anybody to speak as he felt inclined.
   There was no reason why they should not do so, but what was the result
   of it? This Christian liberty of theirs, by-and-by, tended to mischief.
   They became divided into factions. They did not practice discipline as
   they ought to have done and, therefore, this community at Corinth is a
   beacon to all other churches, warning them not to carry on their
   worship in a similar style. It is a very curious thing that some people
   have taken these Corinthians as an example instead of a warning and,
   having copied their methods, the very same result has followed until
   there is no section of the Church of Christ that has become such a
   scandal, through its divisions and its intestine quarrels, as that
   which has imitated the Corinthians in their mode of worship! I suppose
   that while human nature is what it is, the same causes will produce the
   same results to the very end of the chapter. Paul does not tell them
   that their mode of worship was wrong--perhaps it was not--for great
   liberty is allowable to Christians, but he does lay the axe at the root
   of their divisions.

   13, 14. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you
   baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you,
   but Crispus and Gaius. They were such a quarrelsome set of people that
   he could not have taken any comfort from having baptized them. He was
   glad that they could not quote his name as having done so and thus it
   may be, have added still more to their division and strife.

   15-18. Lest any should say that I have baptized in my own name. And I
   baptized also the household of Stephanus: besides, I know not whether I
   baptized any other. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach
   the Gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ should
   be made of no effect. For the preaching of the Cross is to them that
   perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
   I suppose that in that Church, with its many eloquent speakers and men
   of knowledge, there came to be a spirit of emulation among them as to
   which should speak best. And some were tempted to find novel meanings
   in the Word, and to come to the meetings to tell of their wonderful
   discoveries. The Apostle says that he did not so preach--he kept to the
   Cross of Christ, which some counted to be but foolishness. "We know all
   about that," they said. "Ah, but," replied the Apostle, "unto us which
   are saved it is the power of God."

   19-21. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
   will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent Where is the
   wiser, where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Has
   not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the
   wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. God, in His
   infinite wisdom, raised up a number of philosophers just about the time
   of the coming of Christ and a little before that great event. If ever
   there were great minds upon the earth, it was then--yet these men, with
   all their schools of thought, knew not God--and the people did not
   follow after them, so that the earthly wisdom turned out to be a
   failure.

   22-29. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
   but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and
   unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews
   and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the
   foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is
   stronger than men for you see your calling, brethren, how that not many
   wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called:
   but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
   wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
   things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which
   are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring
   to nothing things that are: that no flesh should glory in His Presence.
   And, at this day, it is a great snare to the Church when she glories in
   her education, when she puts any confidence in the learning, or the
   wit, or the eloquence of her ministers, when she relies in any degree,
   whatever, upon an arm of flesh. The sword of the Spirit, if it is put
   into a velvet and embroidered scabbard, is all the worse for that. Pull
   it out! The Word of God cannot cut while it is hampered with human
   wisdom and human learning half as well as when its keen edge, alone, is
   used! It is the Lord, by the power of His Spirit, who must make the
   Word effectual. Oh, for more faith and truer faith in Him!

   30, 31. But of Him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctifca-tion, and redemption: that,
   according as it is written, he that glories, let him glory in the Lord.
   There is no one else in whom we may glory! Away with every form of
   boasting except that of making our boast in the Lord, and especially of
   glorying in the great atoning Sacrifice of His dear Son, our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ!

A Lost Christ Found

   (No. 2611)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A THURSDAY EVENING, EARLY IN
   THE YEAR 1857.

   "But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's
   journey; and they sought Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances.
   And when they found Him not, they turned back, again, to Jerusalem,
   seeking Him. And it came to pass that after three days they found Him
   in the Temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them
   and asking them questions." Luke 2:44-46.

   WHAT a precious treasure must the child Jesus have been to His parents!
   You who have children whom you love, not merely because they are yours,
   but because you discover in them traits of character which are signs of
   Divine Grace, can tell, in some measure, how precious the Child Jesus
   must have been. Born to His mother in a miraculous manner, her heart
   was set upon Him and, after all the wonderful things that had been said
   about Him by the angel, by Simeon and by Anna, you cannot wonder that
   she expected much, although she really expected less than she received.
   When you think of the perils and troubles to which His parents were
   exposed for His sake, by the sword of Herod, the flight into Egypt and
   the cruelty of Archelaus, you cannot wonder that He was a very choice
   treasure to them, carefully tended and well guarded and protected. They
   had felt how terrible it would be to lose Him. They knew His worth--at
   least they guessed something of that inestimable value which must
   always be attached to the perfect Manhood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Do you not marvel, therefore, that they could have lost Him? It seems
   not a little amazing that they could have allowed Him to go away from
   them even for a minute! Trustworthy as He was, yet He must have been a
   Child so dear to their hearts, His company must have been so precious
   to them that one would have thought His mother could scarcely have
   spared Him from her side for a single moment. You would hardly have
   imagined that in the midst of such a crowd as was assembled at
   Jerusalem she would have left Him alone for an instant. Surely, you
   would say, she would tend that precious treasure perpetually. If she
   took her Child to places where she might lose Him, she would, with the
   utmost care, watch over Him until she brought Him back. And yet Mary
   lost her Son--lost Him in Jerusalem--and even went a day's journey
   before she discovered her loss!

   Do not be astonished, O Believer, do not be amazed at Mary losing her
   Son! You have a treasure quite as precious, for it is the same blessed
   Person! Jesus Christ is yours--not your Son, but your Brother--not your
   child, but your Friend. No, more--your Savior! Yours spiritually, yours
   by precious experience, yours by gracious donation of Himself to you
   and yours by happy communing which He has held with you in many seasons
   of sweet refreshment. Yet some of you have lost Him--lost His
   company--but He has not lost you! His loving heart is still immutably
   the same towards you. You who have lost Him, as you think of your
   former joys, can join with deep emphasis in Cowper's lines--

   "Where is the blessedness I knew

   When first I saw the Lord?

   Where is the soul-refreshing view

   Of Jesus and His Word?

   What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!

   How sweet their memory still!

   But now I find an aching void

   The world can never fill."

   How is it you have lost Christ? One would have thought you would never
   have parted from Him. In such a wicked world as this, with Satan ever
   ready to rob you of Him, with ten thousand enemies trying to take Him
   away from you-- with such a precious Savior whose Presence is so sweet,
   whose words are so melodious and whose company is so dear to you--one
   might have thought you would have watched Him every moment and never
   allowed Him to stray from you. But, alas, you have let Him go! Your
   Jesus has left you and you are seeking Him, and crying, "Oh, that I
   knew where I might find Him!" And, possibly, you went many a day's
   journey before you discovered that you had lost Him. You thought He was
   still in your soul, when really He had gone from you and left you for a
   season, to let you find out your great need of Him that you might seek
   Him, again, with full purpose of heart.

   To you, therefore, I address myself, for I think there is something in
   this narrative especially suitable for you. There is, first, the loss
   of Christ Secondly, the seeking after Christ And, thirdly, the finding
   of Christ

   I. First, I have something to say concerning THE LOSS OF CHRIST.

   And I begin by saying that souls, very dear and precious to the
   Redeemer, may yet lose the sensible enjoyment of His Presence. His
   mother lost Him, His father lost Him. They were very dear to Him and He
   was very dear to them, yet they lost Him. Many of the Lord's beloved
   people have lost their Savior. Not lost Him wholly--that can never
   be--their substance is in them, even when they have lost their leaves.
   The holy Seed within them is the substance of their piety, but they
   have lost His visible Presence and yet they are dear to Him, as when,
   by faith, with Simeon, they took Him in their arms and kissed Him with
   the lips of ardent affection. The best of saints sometimes have to
   endure the hiding of God's Countenance and are made to walk through
   dark paths where they see not the shining of the sun. Shall I pause to
   give you instances? I might find you many such in God's Word, but
   instead, thereof, let me find them in your own hearts. Who among us,
   that has long known the Lord, has not had, sometimes, to mourn the
   absence of our Savior? Like the dove that has lost its mate,
   inconsolable until it has returned, we have been sitting alone and
   pouring out our moans and groans. We have sung, in plaintive tones--

   "Return, O holy Dove, return

   Sweet messenger of rest!

   I hate the sins that made You mourn,

   And drove You from my breast." We have cried to Him to come back, but
   He has hidden His face from us, and covered Himself in the thick
   darkness, nor would He manifest Himself to us.

   The first time that this great trouble surprises a true Christian, he
   usually draws this conclusion from it--"I am not the Lord's child, or
   else I would always have the smile of His love." It is a wrong
   conclusion! It is the logic of unbelief, it is a false logic, its
   conclusion is, therefore, untrue! A child does not always have its
   father's smile, though it is a fondly loved one, and is greatly
   delighted in--it is the offspring of its father's heart, very dear to
   him, sprung from his inmost soul as well as from his loins, yet it does
   not always have a smile, nor always a sweet word from him. There must
   be, sometimes, even in Christian families, sharp words from a wise
   parent's loving lips. It is not, therefore, a fair inference that
   Christ has left the soul on which He is not smiling. Oh, conclude not,
   you distressed one, you who have lost the evidence of Grace and the
   comforting Presence of your Master! Conclude not that He has shut up
   His heart of compassion when He has seemed to close His eyes of love.
   "I sleep, but My heart wakes," He says. "I shut My eyes upon you, but
   My heart is still loving you. I lift the rod and scourge you, but my
   heart, in its inmost recesses, has still your name inscribed upon it. I
   will not leave you, I will not forsake you, I have not cast you away. I
   have chastened you sorely, but I have not given you over unto death.
   The clouds have not quenched the sun, you shall yet see the light. I
   will yet shine upon you and once more will I manifest Myself to you."
   The losing of the conscious realization of Christ's Presence, the
   suspension of communion with Him is a very disagreeable and a very sad
   part of Christian experience, but let this be noted--it is often the
   experience of a true Christian and some of the very best and most
   highly favored of God's children have had to suffer it.

   Now please notice where the parents of Jesus lost Him. They lost Him at
   the feast at Jerusalem and if ever you lose the company of your Master,
   O Christian, you will most likely lose it at a feast! I never lost my
   Master's company at a funeral--such a thing is more than possible at a
   wedding. I have never lost my Savior's Presence in the house of
   mourning, by the bedside of the sick and dying--but I have sometimes
   felt suspension of fellowship with my Lord when the flute and the viol
   have been sounding in my ear and when joy and gladness ruled the hour.
   Our most happy moments are our most perilous ones! It is said that
   where the most beautiful cacti grow--the most glorious of
   flowers--there are to be found the most venomous of snakes and, truly,
   among our delights are to be found our dangers. As Cleopatra had an asp
   introduced to her in a basket of flowers, so have we many an asp
   brought to us in our joys. Take heed in the time of your joys,
   Believer--you are safer in your season of sorrow!

   Storms afford the safest sailing for a Christian, calms are, for him,
   more terrible than whirlwinds. Deep waters know no rocks, shallow
   waters that gaily ripple are the perils of the sea of our life. Far out
   upon the ocean, where the horizon has its round ring and nothing is
   within sight, the ship is seldom in danger, but near the shore, when
   the white cliff gladdens the eyes of the mariner--there the pilot must
   look well to his helm! In your troubles, God is often especially with
   you, but He is not always with you in your joys. Job's sons learned
   that there were dangers in feasts--God's sons may not learn the same
   lesson in so terrible a manner--but they may learn it in a very
   grievous way. It would have been better for David to have been sick on
   his bed than to have been walking on his housetop enjoying the evening
   breeze. And it would be better for you to be cast into the fiery
   furnace of affliction, where you can be refined, than to be left to lie
   down in the meads of happiness, where you may have poison poured into
   your ear by a wily adversary. Beware of your joys! There is more fear
   of losing Christ at a feast than anywhere else. You are a young
   Christian and you are going out to a party this week--mind what you do!
   I will not say to you--Do not go. If you can ask God's blessing in
   going, go. But I do say to you--Take care, take care! Mind you, be
   careful! Reef your sails when you get there. Go as fast as you like
   when you are alone, but mind what you are doing when you are in the
   society of others. Take care, take care, take care, especially in mixed
   company!

   And, ah, I am sorry to have to say--Take care, too, when you are in
   professedly Christian company, for what fine "Christian company" there
   is to be seen, sometimes. Christians that cannot find amusement enough
   for themselves, cannot talk about the Lord Jesus, cannot mention His
   name, cannot find pleasure enough in the things of Scripture, but must
   turn to other and meaner things to supply them with joy. Take heed of
   all doubtful company--there is little good to be gained in some of your
   gatherings. If you cannot spend your time in prayer and in seeking what
   Jesus said and did, you had better be at home. Christ is often lost at
   a feast--His Presence is often withdrawn from us when we get into
   company. Our Jesus loves seclusion--He will not strive, nor lift up His
   voice, nor cause it to be heard in the streets! He loves to dwell with
   His people in the privacy of the house. His message is, "Come, My
   people, enter into your chambers, and shut your door after you." You
   will not lose your Master there. Have Him with you in your own
   household--you will not lose Him there! Walk with Him, alone, and you
   will not lose Him. I do not say--Have no feasts--

   "Why should the children of a King Go mourning all their days?"

   I will not say--Have no hours of gladness--you have a right to them. I
   will not say--Do not meet together--do so, your meeting may be
   profitable to each of you. But I do say--Take care what you do. Christ
   Jesus was lost at a feast by His mother and He may be lost by you
   unless you are very careful.

   To young persons who are seriously inclined, yet not decided for God,
   let me solemnly say that evil company is a snare of the devil. Oh, how
   many have been ruined by it! If Satan can but get you back to your old
   companions, he thinks it will be all right for him and that he will be
   sure to have you at last. Nothing will do for a man who has kept evil
   company but to leave it altogether. You cannot bear much of it--you had
   better give it up, altogether--then you will be entirely safe. Or else
   there will be first, one, and then another enticing you a little way
   back, and then a little further back until who can tell?--All those
   fair beginnings, as you thought them to be, may end by being blighted
   and destroyed by the blast of carnal, frothy conversation! The Lord
   deliver us from losing Jesus at a feast!

   Observe, also, that Mary and Joseph lost Jesus for three days, from
   which I learn that it is possible for a Believer to lose the company of
   his Master for a long time, and yet find Him, again, after all. They
   did find Him after the three days and you, too, poor mourning Believer,
   will find your Savior again! There is a poor doubter yonder. He is sick
   at heart, for he has lost his Lord and he cannot find Him. Oh, how he
   has groaned and poured out his heart before God, but still no answer
   has come to his cry. He concludes, therefore, that he must perish! No,
   poor desponding one, the parents of Jesus found Him the third day, so
   seek Him once more! His absence is but temporary. It may be long, but
   the longest hiding of His face shall have an end. O poor, timid child,
   cry not at the eclipse--though it may last an hour, the sun's light is
   not quenched! O you poor Little-Faith, you may well sigh, but do not
   despair! If Jesus has left you for a while, He will yet return to you,
   you shall again behold His face, again bask in the sunshine of His love
   and know that He is yours and that you are His. If you have lost Him
   for months--yes, even for years, I had almost said--yet shall you find
   Him again! With your whole heart seek Him and He will be found of
   you--only give yourself up thoroughly to the search for Him and verily
   He will not entirely leave you, but you shall yet discover Him to your
   joy and gladness, and shall again be feasted with marrow and fatness.
   Three days was the Child Jesus lost, but yet He was found again by
   Joseph and Mary! So Christ may be for a long time, absent, and yet may
   the poor saint find comfort in Him once more.

   II. Now I come to notice THE SEEKING AFTER CHRIST. The father and
   mother of Jesus sought Him and those who have lost Christ's Presence
   will do well to imitate their example.

   Note, first, that they sought Him very judiciously, by which I mean
   that they sought Him in the right places. They went back to Jerusalem
   and sought Him. It was at Jerusalem they lost Him, so it was at
   Jerusalem that they might naturally expect to find Him. Tell me where
   you lost the company of Christ and I will tell you the most likely
   place for you to find Him again. Did you lose the company of Christ by
   forgetting prayers and becoming slack in your devotions? Have you lost
   Christ in the prayer closet? Then you will find Him there! Did you lose
   Christ through some sin? Then you will find Him in no other way but by
   the giving up of the sin and seeking, by the Holy Spirit, to mortify
   the member in which the lust dwells. Did you lose Christ by neglecting
   the Scriptures? Then you must find Christ in the Scriptures where you
   lost Him--you will find Him. It is a true saying, "Look for a thing
   where you dropped it, it is there." So look for Christ where you lost
   Him, for He has not gone away. It is hard work to go back for
   Christ--John Bunyan tells us that the pilgrim found the piece of the
   road back to the arbor of ease--that journey back that he had to travel
   to find his roll under the settle--the hardest piece he had to go.
   Twenty miles on the road is easier to go than one mile back for the
   lost evidence. Take care, then, when you find your Master, to cling
   more closely to Him! But if you have lost Him, go back and seek Him
   where you lost Him.

   And note, too, that they sought Him among His kinsfolk and
   acquaintances. And that is the right place for us, also, to find Him.
   If I am in distress of soul, where can I get relief? I saw a huge
   placard as I came along, just now, recommending persons who have the
   heartache to go to Charles Matthews to get it cured--I suppose, by
   seeing a play. Ah, they will go a long while, if it is realheartache,
   before they will get it taken away there. The theater is the place
   where they get the heartache, not where they lose it! People don't lose
   diseases, generally, where they catch them. If you catch a fever
   anywhere, I would not advise you to go to the same house to get rid of
   it. If you have the heartache through indulging in some sin, it is not
   by deeper draughts of sin that you can cure it! Drinking may stupefy
   and intoxicate you for a while, and make you forget it, but it is a bad
   thing to use intoxicating liquor instead of the real remedy. O you that
   have the heartache, you that have broken hearts, you that have troubles
   rolling over your heads--where can you expect to find Christ? Why,
   among His kinsfolk and acquaintances! Do not go to the giddy haunts of
   vice and sin--go not where there is revelry and mirth, but go where the
   disciples of Jesus are known to meet! Talk with His people, converse
   with those who have the most knowledge of His love and of His power to
   save. It is most likely that you will find your Savior among His
   kinsfolk and acquaintance--go not to the world to look for Him! Seek
   pearls where they lie deep down in the sea, but seek them not where
   such treasures never were discovered. Otherwise, you will go on a
   fool's errand in verity and truth.

   Mark, again, that while they sought Jesus judiciously, they sought Him
   continuously. They did not look for Him just one day and then give up
   the search--but they kept on looking until they found Him. So,
   Christian, if you have lost the precious joy of communion with your
   Lord, keep on seeking it and do not stop your prayers until you have
   recovered it. Be not content with one dive into the depths after this
   pearl, but dive again and again, with untiring perseverance, until you
   discover it. And yet, again, we are told that they sought Him
   sorrowfully. Mary said to Jesus, "Your father and I have sought You
   sorrowing." I know this--no true Believer will ever lose the company of
   His Lord without sorrowing over his loss--it would be impossible! I
   have heard some of you say that you have not had fellowship with Christ
   lately, but if you make that confession with a smile on your face, I
   have grave doubts about your piety. True Christians think it their
   greatest grief to lose their Master's Presence--they do not talk of it
   lightly--it is their misery that they have not the Prince of Mercy with
   them! They perpetually need His company and if it is withdrawn, even
   for an instant, they feel that the light of the sun is taken away from
   their eyes--

   "'Tis Heaven to dwell in His embrace,

   And nowhere else but there."

   The parents of Jesus sought Him sorrowfully and we must do the same if
   we have lost Him. The best messengers to find Christ are the penitent
   tears of His saints. Tears act on Divine mercy like the magnet on the
   needle--the tears of the Christian find the heart of God. Go after your
   Master with wet eyes and He will soon come to you. There is a sacred
   connection between Christ and weeping eyes, for it is Christ's office
   to wipe the mourner's eyes. And whenever He sees you weeping, His
   fingers are eager to be wiping them. He must wipe them. He cannot bear
   to see the tears and, if He wipes them, He must come to you. So, the
   surest way to find Him is to seek Him sorrowing. There is nothing like
   a sorrowing prayer if we have lost our Lord. Prayers from a heart that
   is wrung with the rough hand of sorrow are the most acceptable in the
   ears of the God of Sabaoth. If you are sorrowing, O Christian, then
   seek on and believe that you are all the nearer to finding your Lord
   when your sorrows increase! Tears are the bilge-water of the soul--the
   eyes are the pumps and thus God keeps you floating till He brings you,
   again, into the haven of rest and peace! It is a blessed thing to be
   able to seek Christ, though it is sorrowfully.

   III. Now I close by speaking concerning THE FINDING OF CHRIST. Mark,
   first, where the lost Christ was found. Do you know where His parents
   went to seek Him? When they went to Jerusalem, they asked all their
   kinsfolk and acquaintances, "Have you seen that dear lovely Child?" All
   knew Him, but they answered, "No, we have not seen Him." I suppose they
   then went to the house of entertainment, the inn where they had stayed,
   and asked, "Is our Son here? Is our Child here--that fair-haired Boy,
   the most beautiful you ever saw?" "Ah," the people would reply, "that
   is an old tale with women. Go away! We have not seen Him. He is not
   here." Christ was not in the inn. There was not room for Him there when
   He was born and there was not likely to be room for Him to remain there
   afterwards. They did not go to the palace to seek Him--not inside it,
   at any rate. They were afraid of Herod, for if Herod had laid hold of
   Him, there would have been an end of Him. I daresay they thought that
   the dear Child had been attracted by the splendid buildings that decked
   Jerusalem with glory, and that He would be sure to be in the crowd,
   gazing at some of the great and grand structures, so they went through
   the principal streets, thinking, surely, He would be there. And when
   they asked the curious people from foreign countries who were
   investigating all the wonders of the city, if they had seen the Child,
   they most likely stared them in the face, for Christ Jesus is not
   always to be found with the curious in their research. There was a
   mountebank in the street and a number of children had gathered around
   him and the performance might be likely to attract Jesus, so His
   parents went there, but folly knew nothing about the holy Child Jesus.

   At last, His mother thought that, possibly, He might be in the Temple.
   Yes, that was the place for Him! He was the King of the Temple, and a
   king should be in his palace--and there they found Him, humbling the
   pride of the doctors! So learn from this, O Christian, that you will
   never find your Master where folly exhibits herself to gazing
   multitudes. You will never find Him where curious learning studies with
   deep research to discover everything that is wonderful and profound.
   You will never find Him where giddy mirth is gathered in the assemblies
   of the ungodly. But if you would find Christ, you must find Him in His
   Temple, in the house of prayer! It is here that He makes His glories
   known! It is here that He speaks to His children. Here are set thrones
   ofjudgment, the thrones of the house of David--

   "The King Himself comes near,

   And feasts His saints today.

   Here we may sit and see Him here,

   And love, and praise, and pray.

   One day amidst the place

   Where my dear God has been,

   Is sweeter than ten thousand days

   Of pleasurable sin."

   Sinner, if you seek Christ, seek Him where He is to be found! If you
   seek happiness, peace and mercy, go after Him where He goes. Lie down
   at the pool of Bethesda and if God has not yet quickened you, oh, that
   you might be brought to the pool of Siloam, to the gate of Divine
   Mercy, for it is here that Jesus Christ loves to resort and work the
   great wonders of His Grace! To the saints, I wish to say just this--Do
   not rest if you have lost the society of your Lord. Do not give sleep
   to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids until you have had restored
   to you the communion that has been suspended. Do not live, oh, I
   beseech you, do not live--live, did I say?--it is notliving--do not
   continue to merely existin such a condition for another hour! If your
   fellowship with Christ is broken, run to your house, fall upon your
   knees and cry to Him to give you fresh manifestations of His love. It
   is dangerous to delay! O child of God, it is perilous to be without
   your Lord! This would be to make you like sheep without its shepherd, a
   tree without water at its roots, a sere leaf in the tempest, not bound
   to the Tree of Life. Oh, may Christ influence your heart, that you may
   first see your danger and then, with full purpose of heart, seek after
   Him who is waiting to be found of you! I beseech you, by your desire
   for usefulness and happiness. I beseech you, by the loveliness of
   Christ, by the fearful condition of being found out of fellowship with
   Him. I beseech you, by your own sorrow, which you have already
   suffered, and by the misery which will certainly increase unless you
   find Him! I beseech you rest not until you have found Christ, again, to
   the joy and gladness of your spirit!

   And as for those of you who know not the Savior, what I have been
   saying is as nothing to you--you are careless about these all-important
   matters--but I beseech you, by Him that lives and was dead, by the
   solemnities of Hell, by the dread mysteries of eternity, by the bliss
   of Heaven and by the terrors of the Day of Judgment--I beseech you as a
   dying man speaking to dying men, if you have never found Christ, let
   these words ring in your ears--you are without God, without Christ,
   without hope and strangers from the commonwealth of Israel! Let me say
   those words again, though they are like the tolling of a knell--
   Without God, without Christ, without hope and strangers from the
   commonwealth of Israel! Ponder over those two words, "Without Christ!
   Without Christ!" And if they do not stagger you, God help you! But if,
   my Hearer, they do cause you to start. If God shall make them break you
   up, then, Sinner, when He has broken you in pieces, remember that
   Christ Jesus is willing to save all those whom He has made willing to
   be saved! As certainly as you need Him, He wants you! Seek Him and you
   will find Him! Do but knock and the door of mercy shall be opened! Do
   but ask and you shall receive!

   O awakened Sinner, here is Christ's message to you! "He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved." Oh, that you would believe in Christ
   and be baptized! Oh, that God would help all of you who have nothing of
   your own, to give yourselves up to Christ and take Him to be your
   All-in-All! But, hardened Sinner, I send you away with those dreadful
   words which I repeated, just now, and I hope they will ring in your
   ears all the week--when you walk the streets, when you are on your bed,
   when you are at your meals--without God, without Christ, without hope
   and strangers to the commonwealth of Israel And, therefore, without
   Heaven! Those who have the earnest of Heaven even now have a blessed
   "hope which makes not ashamed." May that hope be given to you, my
   Hearers, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 57:10-21; 58:1-11.

   The Prophet has been giving a very terrible description of the sin of
   the nation. We need not read it all, but at last he says this--

   Verse 10. You are wearied in the greatness of your way. "You are worn
   out with your own way. You have been so zealous in your rebellion
   against God that you have actually fatigued yourself in the pursuit of
   evil." That is a true description of those who have worn themselves out
   in the ways of sin.

   10. Yet said you not, There is no hope: you have found the life of your
   hand; therefore you were not grieved. Though they had hunted for
   pleasure and had not found it, and had brought themselves into great
   distress, yet they would not give up the hope of, after all, succeeding
   in their rebellion. Oh, how obstinately are men set upon seeking
   satisfaction where it can never be found--namely, in the pursuit of
   sin! These people were still alive and they were content to be so, but
   they were not grieved although God had sorely chastened them.

   11. And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and
   have not remembered Me?''Me, your Maker, your Friend, to whom you owe
   your very soul, unless that soul shall go down into the Pit, 'You have
   not remembered Me.'"

   11. Nor laid it to your heart; have not I held My peace even of old,
   and you do not fear Me?When God is very long-suffering and lets men
   alone in their sin, then, often, they quite forget Him and have no fear
   of Him.

   12. I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall
   not profit you. If God once takes the self-righteous man's
   righteousness and explains what it really is, He will soon reveal to
   its owner that it is a mere delusion and sham that will not profit him
   at all.

   13. When you cry, let your companies deliver you.' 'When sickness,
   depression of spirit and death, itself, shall come to you, and you
   begin to dread what is to follow, and cry to those who comforted you in
   your time of health, what will they be able to do for you?"

   13. But the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but
   he that puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit
   My holy mountain. All confidence in men shall be blown away as chaff is
   driven by the wind--but faith in God wins the day.

   14, 15. And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take
   up the stumbling block out of the way of My people. For thus says the
   high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell
   in the high and holy place with him, also, that is of a contrite and
   humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the
   heart of the contrite ones. That is a wonderful verse! You notice that
   the prelude to it explains the greatness and the holiness of God and
   then, like an eagle swooping out of the sky even down to the earth, we
   find God coming from His high and lofty place to dwell with humble and
   contrite hearts! Not with the proud--not with you who think yourselves
   good and excellent--does God dwell, but with men who feel their sin and
   acknowledge it. With men who feel their unworthiness and confess it. I
   will read this verse again to impress it upon your memory. "Thus says
   the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I
   dwell in the high and holy place with him, also, that is of a contrite
   and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the
   heart of the contrite ones."

   16. For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry: for
   the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. See
   the tender meaning of God's message in this verse. He has been
   encouraging the guilty one and making him feel the enormity of his
   offenses and then He says, "I will not do that any more, lest I should
   crush him. He is too weak to bear any more punishment or reproof.
   Therefore I will not any longer afflict him, but I will turn to him in
   mercy, 'for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I
   have made.'"

   17. For the iniquity ofhis covetousness was Iangry, andsmote him:
   Ihidand was angry, andhe went on forwardin the way ofhis heart. Here
   God shows that His chastening does not always produce a good result,
   for, sometimes, when men are tried on account of sin, they grow worse
   and worse. "I hid and was angry, and he went on forward in the way of
   his heart." What does God say of such a great sinner as that?

   18. I have seen his ways. "I have seen that he goes from bad to worse
   when I afflict him. Now I will try another plan. 'I have seen his
   ways,'"

   18, 19. And will heal him: I willleadhim, also, andrestore comforts
   unto him and to his mourners. Icreate the fruit of the lips; Peace,
   peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the LORD;
   and I will heal him. It is heart-melting to see the tenderness of God.
   "I will not further smite him, lest his spirit should fail before me. I
   will not continue to strike him because I can see that he only goes
   farther away from Me, the more I chastise him. I will deal with him in
   abounding love. 'I will heal him.'" I believe that there is many a
   sinner who runs away from God thinking that the Lord is his enemy and,
   as God pursues him, he does not dare look back. He thinks that it is
   the step of the Avenger that he hears, so he flees faster and farther
   away from God. But when he does venture to look back and sees that it
   is a loving Father's face that is gazing upon him, oh, how he regrets
   his folly in running from Him! Then he throws himself into the arms of
   the God of Love and wonders how he could have been the enemy of this,
   His greatest Friend. May such a happy turn as that happen to some whom
   I am now addressing!

   20, 21. But the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest,
   whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, says my God, to
   the wicked. They may have the semblance of peace, or a false peace, but
   nothing which is worthy of being called peace.

   Isaiah 58:1, 2. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet
   and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their
   sins. Yet they seek Me daily. There are many nominally religious people
   who are full of sin. They have an external religion which allows them
   to live in rebellion against God. And such people are not easily
   convinced of sin. Hence the Prophet is bid to lift up his voice like a
   trumpet. Yet, even if he does so, they will not hear him. There are
   none so deaf as those that will not hear--and these men do not wish to
   hear what God has to say to them "Yet they seek Me daily"

   2. And delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and
   forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of Me the ordinances
   of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. They are always in
   a place of worship if possible. They cannot have too many services and
   sermons, yet they have no heart towards God. O my dear Friends, let us
   always be afraid of merely external religiousness! Genuine conversion,
   real devotion to God, true communion with God--these are sure
   things--but mere outward religiousness is nothing but so much varnish
   and tinsel! It is, indeed, but the ghastly coffin of a soul that never
   was quickened unto spiritual life. This is the way these sham
   religionists talked about their religion.

   3. Why have we fasted, they say, and You see not? Why have we afflicted
   our soul, and You take no notice? When God rejects a man's religion,
   what must be the reason of it? Here is the explanation.

   3. Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all
   your labors. "You fast, but you make your workmen toil on! You
   determine that they shall not have one atom of their labor abated and
   you make an amusement of what you call a fast. 'In the day of your fast
   you find pleasure.'"

   4. Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fiat
   of wickedness: you shall not fast as you do this day, to make your
   voice to be heard on high. The best sort of mere external religion will
   soon turn sour. If you do not worship the Lord in a right spirit, God
   will loathe the very form of your service! Why, you might, by
   hypocrisy, make even Prayer Meetings to be hateful in the sight of God!
   And the ordinances may be made as abominable to God as the "mass"
   itself! You can soon degrade hearing sermons into mere listening to
   oratory and the Sabbath may easily become an object only of
   superstitious and formal observance. The heart--the heart is
   everything! If that is wrong, it sours the sweetest things under
   Heaven.

   5. Is it such a fast that Ihave chosen? A day for a man to afflict his
   soul?Is it to bow down his headas a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth
   and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and an acceptable day to
   the LORD? Does God care only for the externals of worship? Is He
   satisfied with sackcloth and ashes, and the hanging down of the head
   like a bulrush?

   6. Is not this the fast that Ihave chosen? To loose the bands of
   wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
   free, and that to break everyyoke?Yes, this is true fasting before
   God--not to demand your pound of flesh and declare that you will have
   it. Not to grind down the poor man to the last farthing, but, "to loose
   the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens and to let the
   oppressed go free."

   7. Is it not to dealyour bread to the hungry, and thatyou bring thepoor
   that are cast out to yourhouse? When you see the naked, that you cover
   him; and that you hide not yourself from your own flesh? That is the
   kind of fast that the Lord approves--to deny yourself that you may give
   to those who are in need!

   8. 9. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health
   shall spring forth speedily: then your righteousness shall go before
   you; the glory of the LORD shall be your reward. Then shall you call
   and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and He shall say, Here I am.
   If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the pointing of the
   finger and speaking vanity. That is, if you shall take away all
   oppression, all wrong-doing to men, all talking of lies and speaking
   vanity, "Then shall your light break forth as the morning."

   10, 11. And if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
   afflicted soul; then shall your light rise in obscurity and your
   darkness be as the new day: and the LORD shall guide you continually,
   and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat your bones: and you
   shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose
   waters fail not What promises God gives to those who consider the poor
   and needy round about them! But if you shut your ears to the cry of the
   distressed, God will shut His ears to your cry.

Questions and Answers Concerning Zion

   (No. 2612)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 5, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 8, 1883.

   "What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORRD has
   founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it." Isaiah
   14:32.

   ZION evidently attracted great attention in its own day and, I suppose,
   the term, "Zion," stood for the whole city. It was a city of many
   singularities and it was especially remarkable for its worship when
   Jerusalem was as it should be. It had a Temple, but there was no image
   in it. Worship was continually carried on there, but the God who was
   worshipped was invisible. This made Zion and its Temple different from
   all other cities and all other temples under Heaven, for, wherever else
   you went, you saw graven images set up and men prostrating themselves
   before the work of their own hands. It was not so in Zion. There, the
   one living and true God resided, and the Temple at Jerusalem was the
   center of His worship for all the faithful--and every type or symbol in
   His solemn service was meant to teach the people concerning Him. Zion
   was remarkable, not so much for the strength of its defenses, the
   beauty of its palaces and the glory of its Temple, as for being "the
   city of the great King." "God is in the midst of her, she shall not be
   moved." Hence, although Zion was but a little hill and other hills were
   great compared with it, yet the fame of it went forth even to the ends
   of the earth.

   Zion is always a type of the Church of the living God--and everywhere
   the Church of God is singular and, for that reason, noticeable. It is a
   power altogether unlike all other powers, a Kingdom quite different
   from the kingdoms of the earth. It uses not the force of arms--it has
   no defense except the indwelling Deity--it knows nothing of the pomp of
   earthly splendor, it exists for God's Glory and for no other purpose.
   Its reason for being a Church at all is that Jesus Christ may be
   honored and glorified in its midst and, therefore, the true Church of
   Christ is sure to be noticed, however obscure it may be in any
   particular place. You cannot plant a Christian Church in a village
   without its being discovered. It may be said of Christ's Church as it
   was said of Himself, "He could not be hidden" neither can His Church!
   And in any kingdom or country, though the true Christians may form a
   very small remnant, yet they are sure to be noticed. They are as a fire
   that gives light as well as heat and, therefore, their presence must be
   known and felt.

   I push this Truth of God a little further and say that if you are one
   of the citizens of this Zion, one of the members of the Church of God,
   you, also, will be known. You cannot go through the world unobserved!
   You are like Bunyan's pilgrim when he passed through Vanity Fair. He
   was but a humble individual, yet everybody looked at him because he
   hurried through the fair, neither attracted by its business nor
   detained by its wealth. Christian and his companion simply sped on and
   when the men of the place asked them, "What will you buy?" they gave no
   answer but this, "We buy the Truth," and hastened on as fast as they
   could! And you must do the same if you are bound for the Celestial
   City. It may be that they will not take you, as the people of Vanity
   Fair took Faithful, and send you to Heaven in a chariot of fire, but
   they will be sure to notice you. In a free country like this, you may
   be almost anything that you like except a Christian. There is no
   liberty for you and you will find that the dogs of Hell will bark at
   you because you are a stranger and a foreigner in this world! If you
   were a child at home, they would not trouble you, but you are of a
   different race from the men of the world who have their portion in this
   life--and, as you pass along, they will let you know that you do not
   belong to them.

   They do not wish to understand you and you will find that they will
   always be ready to misrepresent you. And when they have finished their
   misrepresentation, they will endeavor to laugh you to scorn. Of old,
   Zion was so remarkable that the nations sent messengers to enquire
   about it. And today the people of God are a remarkable people, a
   pilgrim race, strangers and sojourners in the world, passing on to "a
   city which has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God." If you are
   a true Believer in Christ, you will be sure to be noticed, questioned,
   quizzed, criticized, caricatured, misrepresented--never mind all
   that--it is the lot of all the holy Seed, and the citizens of Zion must
   expect such treatment until the Lord Himself shall come.

   Our text may be made to apply to all God's people and I shall use the
   Jews and Zion as the basis upon which I shall build up my discourse.
   From their history we shall try to gather the true meaning of the
   passage. In it we have the mention of messengers and we shall enquire,
   first, What do these messengers of the nation ask? Secondly, why should
   they be answered? And, thirdly, how shall they be answered? ' 'That the
   Lord has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it."

   I. First, WHAT DO THESE MESSENGERS ASK?

   Messengers came from Babylon to Zion and, no doubt, one of the first
   questions they asked was, " What is the treasure of Zion?What is the
   wealth of this city? It stands not by the sea, like Tyre, so that it
   may flourish by its merchandize. It is not situated among the cedars of
   Lebanon, so that it may sell its precious wood or its carved work. This
   city stands in a strange place and yet we see that it is a wealthy
   place--what is the source and the extent of its wealth?" Unhappily,
   Hezekiah forgot how to answer that question aright, and he took the
   Babylonian messengers through his palace and showed them his
   material'treasures. He led them from one secret cabinet to another and
   let them see all his riches. And they looked on with wondering,
   covetous eyes and went home to tell what loot there would be there,
   what a grand place Jerusalem would be to sack and how all Babylon might
   be the richer because of the treasures that were hidden there. How
   unwise was Hezekiah! He ought to have given a far better answer. I have
   been in churches on the Continent where I have been asked by the guide
   whether I would like to see the treasury, and I have seen it. In one
   church, I saw what was estimated at about a million pounds sterling in
   the form of plates of different kinds for the adornment of the altar. I
   saw a treasure which was regarded as far more precious than gold and
   silver--a saint with all his bones laid bare, a skeleton saint
   decorated with emeralds, rubies and all kinds of precious stones--but
   it was a ghastly sight for all that! If I had purchased him, I would
   have speedily buried him. Should not such a treasure be buried in the
   earth? It is the best place for saints and sinners, too, when they are
   dead.

   I do not doubt that living saints are a precious treasure in the Church
   of God, yet it would not do, if the messengers of the nations asked us
   what our chief treasure is, to exhibit the members of the
   Church--saints alive or saints dead--or to talk about the wealth of the
   Church, or the intellect of the Church, or even the earnestness and
   prayerfulness of the Church, precious as these things are. There is a
   better answer to that question and our text tells us that the great
   treasure of the Church is the fact that Jehovah has founded her. His
   Grace is the inexhaustible storehouse from which she derives all her
   spiritual wealth!

   The messengers of the nations probably asked next, " What is Zion's
   confidence''" When city after city had been overthrown by Rabshakeh and
   Sennacherib, if messengers came into Jerusalem, no doubt they were
   amazed to find the people holding out against the great king who smote
   and overcame wherever he went. And they said and Rabshakeh said, "What
   is your confidence? Has not the king of Assyria smitten all the gods of
   the people whom he has fought? Upon whose arm do you rely?" If the
   people had taken the messengers and bid them look from the rocky sides
   of Zion, down the steep precipice into the ravines, and if they had
   said, "Who can climb up here?" Or if they had pointed to the tower of
   David, or to the walls of the city well jointed together, or to its
   massive gates and said, "These are our defenses," it would have been a
   poor and sorry reply, for no walls stood out long against the kings of
   Babylon! They brought their battering-rams and engines to the siege and
   very soon they cast up breast-works and all kinds of entrenchments and,
   before long, made a breach in the city walls and rushed in and slew the
   inhabitants.

   But what a good answer it would have been to say, "Jehovah is our
   confidence. He is our defense, our castle and high tower, our battleaxe
   and weapons of war. And He has said that Sennacherib shall not come
   into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with a
   shield, nor cast a bank against it. The adversary may come near enough
   to mark the walls and bulwarks of Zion and count her towers, but he
   shall not be able to capture her, for 'God shall help her, and that
   right early.' He is our defense! Not the valiant men that stand upon
   the watchtowers and shoot swift arrows against the foe. Not the trained
   armies that throng her gates and charge upon the adversary with sword
   and shield, but the Lord God is a wall of fire round about us and the
   glory in our midst." What a grand answer that would have been to the
   question of the messengers!

   Let us also, Beloved, give the same answer to all who ask what is our
   confidence. Let us tell them that our confidence is in God alone. If,
   dear Friends, we are truly citizens of Zion, this is one of the marks
   of our citizenship, that our entire confidence is in that unseen arm
   upon which alone we lean. We look only to God for our salvation, and we
   cast away all confidence in ourselves, or in our fellow men, reckoning
   all earthly supports as being like broken cisterns that can hold no
   water, and trusting alone to the deep eternal fountain of Grace that
   wells up in the heart of God Himself.

   No doubt the messengers of the nations also asked, " What is the
   history of this Zion?What is the story of the nation of which Jerusalem
   is the capital? Where did your fathers come from? Did they obtain
   possession of this land with their own bow and their own swords? Have
   they made advances, step by step, to the greatness whereof they now
   boast?" The right answer to that question was, "God has founded Zion."
   That was the secret of her glorious history and the messengers ought to
   have received no other reply but that to their enquiry! Sometimes,
   nowadays, men come to us and they say, "Where did your Church come
   from? What is the origin of it? From where did it arise?" Well, you may
   tell the story, if you give all the glory to God and if you reflect all
   honor upon the power of Divine Truth, but never fail to go back to the
   very beginning and answer, "God has founded Zion," for if there is a
   church which cannot trace its foundation to the eternal Truth of God's
   Word, to the eternal power of God's Spirit, to the eternal founding by
   God's own Sovereign Grace, it is not the Church of God at all!

   I hope you would give a similar answer to the question about your own
   history. If you are a believer in Christ, how came you to be a
   Christian? How was it that you ever began to love the Lord? How is it
   that you have a good hope of Heaven? How is it that you believe that
   you have eternal life? This is the answer for you to give--

   "Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God. He,
   to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood." Each saved
   soul must say, "It is of God's Grace that I am what I am. As God has
   founded Zion, so has He founded me."

   Another question which these messengers would be sure to ask would be
   this--" What is the expectation of Zion? You say that Jehovah built it
   and that He has, up to now, guarded and preserved it, but to what end
   is such a little city as this made so conspicuous? Why is it so honored
   by the Divine Presence?" Oh, then I hope the people opened their mouths
   wide and told the messengers that God had founded Zion and that the
   poor of His people would trust in it and that they added, "So we have
   the expectation of being provided for, preserved, delivered, magnified
   through God's mercy." And as for you and me, Beloved, when they say to
   us, "What do you expect?" let us open our mouth wide and tell what God
   has done and what we expect He will yet do for us--that He will guide
   us by His counsel and, afterwards, receive us to Glory--that He will
   correct and chasten us as a man chastens his own son--that He will
   perfect our education and then will take us Home to dwell with Him
   where sorrow and sighing can never come! Then let us tell them of the
   coming of our Lord and of the Glory that is wrapped up in His advent.
   And let our hearts burn and our eyes sparkle as, with joyful lips, we
   talk of the things which God has prepared for them that Love Him and
   which He has revealed to us by His Spirit!

   II. Now, secondly, WHY SHOULD THESE MESSENGERS BE ANSWERED?

   The question in our text is, "What will they answer the messengers of
   the nation?" But there is no hint of any question as to whether they
   are to be answered or not. It is taken for granted that a reply is to
   be given to their enquiries. I hope, dear Brothers and Sisters, that we
   shall always be ready to give an answer with meekness and fear to every
   man who asks of us a reason for the hope that is in us. Questions will
   be sure to be put to Christians, for they are men wondered at and,
   hence, there is a necessity for us to be well taught of God and to have
   our minds stored with heavenly knowledge, that we may not be dumb when
   we ought to speak, but may always be ready with such an answer as shall
   be acceptable to God and may be beneficial to those who ask the
   question.

   Some who come to Zion ask questions out of curiosity I should not
   wonder if the ambassadors who came to Jerusalem looked all about the
   city with wondering eyes and kept on enquiring, "What is this? What is
   that? What is the meaning of this memorial and what is the intention of
   this symbol?" They did not ask these questions because they cared
   particularly about what they saw--possibly they asked even more
   questions when they were in Epsom, or when they sauntered through the
   streets of Nineveh, but, having come to Jerusalem, they had a curiosity
   about what was to be seen there, so they began to enquire. In like
   manner, Beloved, there will come to you, to your Zion, to your house,
   persons who will make enquiries about your religion--not that they love
   it, or believe in it--but, still, they would like to know about it. Men
   are curious about religious matters. They jot down in their notebook
   information that they gather concerning them. They may not be,
   themselves, devout, but they would like to know what is the nature and
   extent of your devotion. They may not be, themselves, Believers, but
   they would be glad to learn what kind of faith yours is. Would you
   discourage this curiosity? I think you would be very unwise if you did
   so. No, rather try to make some use of it. It is, in itself, nothing
   particularly worthy of notice, but there is at least a measure of
   hopefulness about it. When men's minds once begin to work, we are led
   to hope and pray that the Spirit of God may work with them and work in
   them, according to the good pleasure of His Grace. It is a very hopeful
   thing when you, my Brothers in the ministry, get an attentive audience
   to listen to you. Mind that you always give them something worth
   listening to! It were an ill day for you and me, in trying to do good,
   if we could never persuade anyone to listen at all. Let us hold the
   wedding guest and detain him with our tale, though it may seem to him
   to be as sad as that of the Ancient Mariner of whom Coleridge speaks,
   let us try to hold him fast till we have told him--

   "The old, old story

   Of Jesus and His love!"

   We shall not complain if people ask, simply out of curiosity, about our
   religion, for that very curiosity will give us an opportunity to set
   things belonging to the Kingdom of God before minds which are somewhat
   receptive. If you ever lose your present access to those ears and they
   grow fast closed to your message, you will say, "I wish that even that
   curiosity would come back, again," for curiosity about the things of
   God may lead to something better, by-and-by, if you know how to use it
   wisely. So, we will answer the messengers of the nation even though
   they ask merely from curiosity.

   No doubt there are others who ask out of contempt The ambassadors of a
   great power like Babylon, when they passed inside the walls of Zion,
   most likely said, "So this is your precious capital, is it? This little
   pettifogging village that we could put in one corner of Babylon and
   never know that it was there--is the city of the great King, is it?"
   And they laughed within themselves for very scorn and said, "This
   little miserable dog hole is your wonderful city, is it? Why, in
   Babylon, we have hanging gardens, wondrous palaces and mighty works of
   art and yet you say, 'Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
   earth is Mount Zion?'" And they gave a loud guffaw at the very thought
   of what seemed to them so absurd! Well, Brothers and Sisters, shall we
   refuse to answer when our questioners ask in contempt concerning our
   Zion? Sometimes we shall do well not to reply, for we are forbidden to
   cast pearls before swine, but, on other occasions we may answer them
   because we do not wish men to think that we are ashamed or afraid to
   declare our convictions, or that we have nothing to say concerning the
   faith that we hold. Oh, proclaim it, though all Philistia shall be
   listening! Proclaim it among the nations that the Lord reigns! Proclaim
   it amid a senate of philosophers or a parliament of kings!

   This Truth of God might well be written across the sky and the sun,
   itself, as it makes its daily circuit, should be the Mercury to bear
   this message everywhere! The heavens should proclaim the Glory of God
   and the firmament show His handiwork! And it is our desire and
   intention to let the Gospel be published wide as the light of day!
   Publish it even to the contemptuous, for, sometimes, even he who
   despises is not the last to be converted. And an enemy who has enough
   light to hate the Truth of God may have enough to be brought to love
   it! Think not that a man like Saul of Tarsus, the persecutor of the
   saints, is the most hopeless of mankind. God thought not so and He
   brought him in penitence to His feet and made him to be not a whit
   behind the very chief of His servants! Therefore, if men ask you about
   religion, even out of contempt, and you can see the sneer upon their
   faces as they ask the question, give them an answer! Tell them of
   Jesus' dying love and of all that wonderful plan of salvation arranged
   by the Sovereign Grace of God. You may even find your answer in our
   text--"The Lord has founded Zion and the poor of His people shall trust
   in it."

   But sometimes, no doubt, the messengers of the nations will ask out of
   admiration. There were some of them that came, like the Queen of Sheba,
   and asked about everything because they admired it all. And there are,
   perhaps among us, some whose hearts God has touched. They have the
   first signs and tokens of an affection for the Truth of God and for the
   Lord--and when they come where you are who love His dear name, they
   will ask you many questions most admiringly. Oh, never be slow to
   answer such enquirers! No, but set out before their eager eyes all the
   wonders of Zion and all the glories of your Lord! Tell them what the
   Lord has done for you and for all His people. Tell them how you were
   washed in the blood of the Lamb, how your heart has been changed,
   cheered and comforted. Tell them everything, for now that the Lord has
   given them some hungering and some thirsting after these things, now is
   your time to bring out the "butter in a lordly dish!" Now is your
   opportunity to set before them the Bread that came down from Heaven,
   even Christ Jesus who is the Bread of Life. Now let them all know about
   the "wines on the lees, well-refined," and the "fat things full of
   marrow," for you have before you those who will gladly feed on all the
   dainties and delights provided in the great banquet of the Gospel.

   And it may be that while you are telling the story, there will be some
   enquirers who will ask because they want to enjoy these good things for
   themselves. The spouse in the Canticles said, "I charge you, O
   daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my Beloved, that you tell Him, that
   I am lovesick." And they then asked her, "What is your Beloved more
   than another beloved, O you fairest among women? What is your Beloved
   more than another beloved, that you so charge us?" So the spouse sat
   down and told them of all His matchless beauties and finished up by
   saying, "This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O daughters of
   Jerusalem." Then they enquired, "Where is your Beloved gone, O you
   fairest among women?--Where is your Beloved turned aside?--That we may
   seek Him with you." In like manner, dear Friends, when you see others
   who are willing to hear what you can say to them about Christ, do not
   hesitate to tell them, for perhaps they, too, will love your Savior!
   Perhaps they have a wish to participate in the merits of His blood and
   the blessings of His salvation--and that is exactly what you wish
   concerning them and concerning all mankind, for you often say--

   "His worth, if all the nations knew Surely the whole world would love
   Him, too." Therefore, tell all who are in the world about it, praying
   God's Spirit to open their hearts that they may receive the message and
   may trust in Jesus and be saved.

   O my dear Hearers who love the Lord, be none of you reticent about
   these precious things, but answer the messengers of the nation whenever
   you meet with them! It may do them good, contemptuous though they may
   be! It may do them good though they are, for the time, but
   curiosity-mongers. Therefore tell them. Tell them the story fully, for,
   at any rate, it will do you good. It is a very useful thing for a man
   to proclaim what spiritual Truth he knows, for he thereby teaches
   himself. It will increase your own sense of safety if you declare to
   others what the real defense of Zion is. It will increase your own
   sense of joy if you proclaim what is the true joy of Zion. For your own
   good, do this, and do it also for the Glory of God. You are to be God's
   mouth to man--let not God ever seem to be silent because you are idle!
   O you people of God, "You are God's heritage"--the word the Apostle
   uses means, "You are God's clergy, so I charge you, be not dumb dogs
   that cannot bark, but let others know what the Lord has done for your
   souls! "You that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence," but speak
   and speak, and speak yet again, and give to the messengers of the
   nations an answer to their enquiries concerning Zion and the Church of
   the living God!

   III. Now I come to the closing and most important point. How SHALL
   THESE ENQUIRERS BE ANSWERED?

   According to our text, they are to be answered by this
   declaration--"The LORD has founded Zion." Whenever any religious
   enquiry is put to you, let it be definitely made known in your answer
   that every good thing that you have, or that the Church of God has,
   comes from God. Leave your hearer in no doubt about this matter--do not
   let him suppose that it came by your own exertion or merit--but say
   most plainly, "The Lord has founded Zion." If one soul is saved, God
   has done it. If 500 souls are saved and banded together in Christian
   fellowship, "this is the finger of God." And if there are tens of
   thousands of saved saints in the world, this is what the Lord has done
   by His own Almighty power! It is not ofman, neither is it byman, but it
   is of the Lord alone! Make that Truth of God very conspicuous in your
   answers to all enquirers.

   And that being done, make this Truth equally plain, that the Lord is
   the Founder of His Church--His true Church--that all her doctrines are
   revealed in His Word and are her doctrines because He has given them to
   her--that her ordinances are taught by Christ, Himself, in His own Word
   and, therefore--and for that reason only--are they ordinances of His
   Church! Lay this down with the utmost emphasis, that the Lord has
   founded Zion as to her doctrines and her ordinances and also as to all
   the polished stones that He has built into all her walls. Christ is the
   one Foundation of His Church and God has laid Him in Zion as the chief
   Cornerstone--elect, precious--but every stone that is laid upon Him is
   laid there according to the Divine purpose and predestination, yes, and
   by the effectual working of the power of the Holy Spirit who brings men
   up from the quarry of sin and builds them upon the Foundation of Christ
   Crucified!

   To make our answer to these messengers complete, they will want to know
   all about our Church and our Zion, so let us acknowledge our own
   poverty. You notice, in the text, that the answer is, "The Lord has
   founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it." Say to the
   enquirers, "Ah, you must not look for anything great in us! We are poor
   by nature and poor by practice, too. And in ourselves we are less than
   nothing and vanity." There may be some very good people in the world
   who think that they are perfect. We are not among them--we could not,
   dare not, will not stand up and say, "We thank God that we are not as
   other men are." We have rather, each one of us, to smite upon our
   breasts and say, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." It is most
   important, in our testimony, that we should confess our spiritual
   poverty, for our Lord Jesus is never magnified unless He is set forth
   as the Savior of sinners. And Grace is never glorified unless sin is
   denounced and bemoaned. O Beloved, let your own poverty be a black foil
   that shall make the precious gem of Divine Grace shine the more
   gloriously in the eyes of men!

   Then say also that, as God has founded Zion, we mean to cleave to her
   That is to say, if this Bible is God's Book, we believe in it from
   cover to cover. If any doctrine, however mysterious, is taught by the
   Spirit of God, we accept it. If we do not understand it, we believe it.
   If there are any ordinance commanded by God, we will obey it to the
   best of our ability as it is delivered to us. I cannot agree with those
   who say that they have "new truth" to teach. The two words seem to me
   to contradict each other--that which is new is not true. It is the old
   that is true, for truth is as old as God. Albeit that its locks are
   bushy and black as a raven for strength and force, yet I might say of
   every Truth of God that its head and its hair are white like wool, as
   white as snow, for its antiquity. "Ah, but," they say, "we are wise in
   this generation; we have learned much from this source and that." Have
   you? Then keep your precious knowledge to yourselves--we do not covet
   it. We are content to believe concerning this Word, that the Lord has
   founded it and, we poor simpletons mean to trust in it, and to cleave
   to it, come what may.

   Do you notice how sweetly is put in the text the resolve to trust in
   what God has founded? "The poor of His people shall trust in it." The
   inhabitants of Jerusalem sheltered behind the walls of Zion and they
   felt perfectly safe. There was Sennacherib coming up with hordes of
   Assyrians, apparently numerous enough to eat them all up, but when they
   knew that God had founded Zion and meant to preserve her, they might
   smile at the king of Babylon, and they did so. "The virgin, the
   daughter of Zion, has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the
   daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you." If Zion is founded
   by God, vain is all the might and malice of man or devil against it--it
   shall stand against all who oppose it. I can fancy Luther talking like
   this, only with stronger sentences than I can put together, and bidding
   the people join in singing that favorite Psalm of his, the 46th -"God
   is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore
   will we not fear though the earth is removed and though the mountains
   are carried into the midst of the sea."

   Let us, also, have this brave confidence, my Brothers and Sisters!
   Trust in Jehovah and be at ease concerning His Truth and cause. Let
   nothing daunt or disturb you. God has routed greater men than the
   wiseacres of the 19th Century! And when they are all swept into the
   nothingness from which they came, His Truth shall still live and
   triumph, glory be to the name of Him who sent it to us and, thereby,
   founded the one only Eternal City, the Church of the living God, the
   pillar and ground of His Truth! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH14'

   Verse 1. For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
   Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be
   joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. This
   promise had a measure of fulfillment when Israel was brought back from
   Babylon. And it is still true that when God's people come to their
   worst, there is always something better before them. On the other hand,
   it is equally sure that when sinners come to their best, there is
   always something terrible awaiting them. The Apostle Paul wrote to the
   Romans, "God has not cast away His people which He foreknew." And his
   declaration agrees with this prophecy, "The Lord will have mercy on
   Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land" I
   believe that there will be a far grander fulfillment of this prophecy
   in that day when God shall bring back His chosen people to their own
   country--and then shall be the fullness of blessing to the Gentiles,
   also. "The strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave
   to the house of Jacob."

   2. And the people shall take them and bring them to their place: and
   the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for
   servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose
   captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. The
   chosen people now have the worst of it in many parts of the world, but
   they shall have the best of it, by-and-by. They shall not always be
   trampled on--their time of uplifting shall come at the last. And there
   is nothing after the last--that which is last, lasts forever.

   3, 4. And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give you
   rest frown your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard bondage
   wherein you were made to serve, that you shall take up this proverb
   against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! The
   golden city ceased!O child of God, you shall, by-and-by, have a
   glorious season of rest! Today is your time of labor. You are now under
   hard bondage, but you shall yet come forth into the fullness of your
   liberty in Christ Jesus. In that day Jehovah, Himself, shall give you
   rest from all your grief and fears. You shall obtain joy and gladness,
   and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. This was a great prophecy for
   Isaiah to utter, for, in his day there was no power on earth equal to
   that of Babylon. That great city abounded in palaces and extraordinary
   wealth--and its power was such that no kingdom could stand against it.
   For a while it broke in pieces all those who fought against it, yet God
   broke Babylon in His own time. And here is a song of rejoicing in
   anticipation of its overthrow, "How has the oppressor ceased! The
   golden city ceased!"

   5. The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the
   rulers. No power can ever be permanently strong that is founded upon
   wickedness. Sooner or later it will have to come to an end. A falsehood
   may array itself in the garments of wisdom and strength and go forth to
   fight hopefully for victory, but, in the end, it must die. The stone of
   the Truth of God will reveal the giant's brow and lay him headlong in
   death.

   6, 7. He who emote the people in wrath with a continual stroke. He that
   ruled the nations in anger is persecuted, and none hinders. The whole
   earth is at rest, and is quiet they break forth into singing. The
   Babylon that none could resist becomes, herself, destroyed and there is
   no one to come to her assistance. Go at this day and see where the owl
   dwells, and mark the habitation of the dragons, and say to yourself,
   "This is Babylon, the great city that was the queen over all nations.
   But she did evil in the sight of the Lord, and spoke extremely proudly
   and, behold, Jehovah has crumbled her in the dust and, now that Babylon
   is gone, 'the whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
   into singing.'"

   8. Yes, the fir trees rejoice at you, and the cedars of Lebanon,
   saying, Since you are laid down, no feller is come up against us. For
   the cruel kings of Babylon cut down the nations as the woodman with his
   axe fells the trees of the forest. But when the power of Babylon was
   broken, peace and quietness reigned everywhere. O Brothers and Sisters,
   what a blissful day it will be when the modern Babylon is taken away,
   for to this hour she is the troubler among the nations! Wherever the
   blight of Popery comes, there is evil, there is oppression, there is
   bondage--and only when Romanism shall be utterly swept away and cast
   like a millstone into the flood, will it be said, "The whole earth is
   at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing." Here is s very
   wonderful picture of the king of Babylon going down to the grave!

   9, 10. Hades from beneath is moved foryou to meetyou at your coming: it
   stirs up the dead foryou, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has
   raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they
   shall speak and say unto you, Are you also become weak as we? Are you
   become like unto us?I t is a fine pictorial representation of the
   spirits of departed kings lifting themselves up from their beds of dust
   and saying, "Are you, king of Babylon, that slew us, also come here?
   The mighty conqueror--are you yourself conquered--and brought to the
   grave?"

   11-15, Your pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of your
   viols: the worm is spread under you, and the worms cover you. How are
   you fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How are you cut
   down to the ground, which did weaken the nations! For you have said in
   your heart, I will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
   stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in
   the sides of the north: I will ascend above the height of the clouds; I
   will be like the Most High. Yet you shall be brought down to Hades, to
   the sides of the Pit. God hates pride with a perfect hatred! He drives
   His sword through the very heart of it and cuts it in pieces. None can
   be great and mighty, and boast of what they are able to do without
   provoking the King of Kings to put forth against them some of His great
   power! Oh, let none of as talk about climbing to Heaven by our good
   works, or getting there by our merits, lest it should happen to us,
   also, that we should "be brought down to Hades, to the sides of the
   Pit."

   16-18. They that see you shall narrowly look upon you, and consider
   you, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did
   shake kkngdoms; that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the
   cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? All the
   kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his
   own house. That is, they lie in state, each one in the mausoleum of his
   family. They went down to death and they were buried with all the honor
   and glory that were supposed to be due to their high position.

   19. But you are cast out of your grave like an abominable branch, and
   as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword,
   that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
   So total, so terrible, so disgraceful was the destruction of Babylon,
   that no honor or glory remained to it.

   20-22. You shall not be joined with them in burial because you have
   destroyed your land and slain your people: the seed of evildoers shall
   never be removed. Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity
   of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
   the face of the world with cities. For I will rise up against them,
   says the LORD of Hosts. And he has done it. It seemed the most unlikely
   thing to happen, but the Lord spoke, and it was done--all the glory of
   Babylon was swept away. "I will rise up against them, says the Lord of
   Hosts."

   22-27. And cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
   nephew, says the LORD. I will also make it a possession for the bittern
   and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the boom of destruction,
   says the LORD of Hosts. The LORD ofHosts has sworn, saying, Surely as
   Ihave thought, so shall it come to pass; andas I have purposed, so
   shall it stand: that I will break the Assyrian in My land, and upon My
   mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off
   them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. This is the
   purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this in the hand
   that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the LORD ofHosts has
   purposed, and who shall disannul it? And His hand is stretched out, and
   who shall turn it back? And God did this to the Assyrians in the day
   when Sennacherib invaded the land and the Angel of Destruction slew the
   whole host in one night! What a striking simile the Lord uses here!
   "This is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the
   Lord of Hosts has purposed, and who shall disannul it? And His hand is
   stretched out, and who shall turn it back?" Conceive in your mind the
   picture drawn here--Jehovah Himself puts out the hand of His
   almightiness and challenges the nations to stand up in opposition to
   it!

   28. In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. About this time,
   the Philistines had plucked up courage and had invaded Judah.

   29. Rejoice not, whole Palestina, because the rod that smote you is
   broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice,
   and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. Ahaz was defeated, but
   Hezekiah was raised up to be the leader of the LORD's people.

   30. And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie
   down in safety: and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall
   slay your remnant. If God's enemies have a bright day or two, it shall
   soon be stormy weather with them. They may for the moment exult over
   God's people, but He knows that their day of reckoning is coming.

   31. Howl, O gate; cry, O city; you, Palestina, are dissolved: for there
   shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his
   appointed times. That is the way the Babylonians would come running
   down from the north. No one would be able to hide himself from them,
   not a single person would find a shelter, or escape from their terrible
   adversaries.

   32. What will they answer the messengers ofthe nation? That the LORD
   has foundedZion, and thepoor ofHispeo-ple shall trust in it. Though the
   passage seems dark at first, yet it is full of consolation to the
   people of God and is of similar import to that other gracious
   promise--"No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every
   tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn."

Sonship Questioned

   (No. 2613)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 12, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 16, 1883.

   "And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of God."
   Matthew 4:3.

   IN speaking upon the temptation of our Lord, I first want to say a few
   words that ought always to be remembered by those who are tempted, lest
   they encounter unnecessary sorrow. And to begin with, I remark that
   there is no sin in being tempted. Even when our first parents were in
   their perfect state, they were liable to temptation. The serpent came
   and beguiled them. It was not their fault that they were tempted--their
   sin was that they yielded to the temptation. We know that our blessed
   Lord was personally without the slightest taint of sin--"holy,
   harmless, undefiled"--yet He was tempted by Satan, himself, the prince
   and leader of all tempters, and He was tempted to what would have been
   the worst of sins. Still, there was no blame attached to Him on that
   account, for He did not yield to the assaults of the Evil One. So, dear
   Friends, should you be tempted while you are about your lawful calling,
   or when you are in the House of God, distinctly engaged in His service
   and worship, do not be surprised! Who are you that you should escape
   temptation when your Lord had to endure it? Do not be cast down by the
   fact of your being tempted, as though it were, in itself, a sin. The
   guilt lies with him who tempts--not with the tempted one until he
   yields to the temptation. Let that always be remembered.

   And remember, next, that temptation does not necessitate sinning. It
   did not in the case of our Lord, for He "was in all points tempted like
   as we are, yet without sin." And that which was possible of Him, in His
   life on earth, can also be possible of you by Him with whom all things
   are possible! A man need not fall into avarice because he is tempted to
   cov-etousness. A man need not become unchaste because he is tempted to
   lewdness. Remember the case of Joseph--he was none the less pure
   because he was so foully tempted. A man need not be false to his
   convictions because someone tries to bribe him to be so--rather, he may
   prove the honesty and uprightness of his heart by recoiling from the
   very touch of the briber. He who is tempted need not, therefore, sin,
   for God, who permits the temptation to come will, with the temptation,
   make a way of escape for him that he may be able to bear it. A man may
   walk in the midst of a furnace of temptation, yet not even the smell of
   fire shall be upon him. He may be "kept by the power of God through
   faith unto salvation" and kept as well amid the most furious
   temptations as if he lived in a region that was most helpful to his
   Graces. A child of God may be specially, peculiarly, singularly and
   emphatically tempted, and yet he may be preserved from sin. In the case
   before us, we see that our Lord was not only tempted, but that He was
   tempted by Satan, by him who has the greatest power and the most
   cunning sleight of hand of all tempters and, though the arch-tempter
   put before Him the subtlest of temptations, yet He did not yield in any
   respect whatever. So may you, dear Friend, pass unharmed, as it were,
   between the very jaws of Hell, preserved and upheld by the Sovereign,
   Omnipotent Grace of God!

   Note, yet again, that it may be necessary for you to be tempted. It
   evidently was so in the case of our Lord, for He did not fall into
   temptation through unwatchfulness. He did not go into temptation
   presumptuously, but we read of Him, that He was "led up by the Spirit
   into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil," so that He was in His
   right place--He was in the path of duty even when He had to go through
   this, His great threefold trial in the desert. It was necessary that it
   should be so with Him that He might be made, in all points, like unto
   His brethren, that He might have full sympathy with us in all our
   temptations and that He might make His life-work complete in every
   respect.

   Temptation may be necessary for us for the purpose of testing and
   trying us. We read, in the Book of Genesis, "It came to pass after
   these things, that God did tempt (or, try) Abraham." That is, God
   testedhim, put his faith to a very severe test. There are no champions
   in God's army who are mere fair-weather soldiers. They must all endure
   hardships and their valor must be tried and proved. God sends none of
   His ships to sea without having first tested them--and when their
   seaworthiness is proved, then they may go on their long voyages. You,
   tried Believer, are to be tested, that the great Angel of the Covenant
   may say to you, as He said to the father of the faithful, "Now I know
   that you fear God." God already knows this through His Omniscience, but
   He would know it practically by testing us and it is, therefore,
   necessary that we should be tempted in order that we may be tested.
   Temptation may also be necessary to us for our spiritual growth.
   Muscles are not developed except by exercise and if we were to be,
   spiritually, put under a glass case, and never suffered to endure
   temptation, we would become dwarfed and stunted--and some of our
   virtues would never be developed at all. Where would our patience be if
   there were no suffering to test it? Where would be the Grace of
   forgiveness if we never had to suffer injury from our fellows? It is
   for our growth in Divine Grace that the stormy winds of temptation are
   let loose upon us, that, like a stalwart oak, we may take firm
   root-hold. By this stern experience, Christian men grow "strong in the
   Lord and in the power of His might." They sit loose to the world and
   they take a firmer grip on the invisible things of God as they are
   tried and tempted by Satan.

   It may also be necessary for us to be tempted to increase our
   usefulness. He that was never tempted cannot help those who are
   tempted! He lacks sympathy because he has never passed through the
   fiery trial to which they are exposed. Dear young man, it may be that
   you wonder why you have such a stormy inward life. Perhaps God is going
   to make you greatly useful as a dispenser of comfort to others. Men
   might be Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder, without trouble, but you
   could not be a Barnabas, a son of consolation, unless you had first
   known what it was to be comforted in time of trial. God might use you
   to scatter His Seed with a hand that was never wounded, but He could
   not use you to bind up the broken in heart unless that hand had been
   rendered tender and sensitive by trial. Your present experience, though
   painful, is a necessary preparation for something which will give you
   tenfold joy--so you may endure the present trial even with cheerfulness
   because of the blessed result that will come from it!

   Beside that, Brothers and Sisters, we must be tempted, or else we
   cannot be victorious. The rule of the Kingdom is-- no battles, no
   crowns; no conflicts, no conquests! We must stand foot to foot in
   deadly combat with the archenemy of souls or else we can never have a
   memorial pillar set up by the wayside, like that one of which Mr.
   Bunyan speaks, where Christian met Apollyon and it was recorded of
   him--

   "The man so bravely played the man, He made the fiend to fly-- Of which
   a monument I stand, The same to testify."

   The great reason why God's children are tempted is for God's Glory,
   for, when they stand fast and defeat the foe, then the strong man is
   overcome by a stronger and then He that is the strongest of all--the
   mighty Son of God--gets fresh crowns upon His head as, one after the
   other, the weakest among His people put to rout the great adversary.
   There is a necessity, then, that you should, at times, be "in heaviness
   through manifold temptations" and, though you may pray not to be led
   into temptation and are bound to do so, yet sometimes it may be
   necessary that, like your Lord, you should be brought into the
   wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

   Note, once more, that solitude will not prevent temptation. "Oh," said
   a young man, "I think that I must give up my job, for it involves me in
   so many temptations." "Ah," said a Christian woman, "I wish that I
   could get right away into some sisterhood where I should have no
   temptations." Yes, and if you did, as some foolish women have done, you
   would have your temptations greatly increased! I am afraid that,
   sometimes, solitude is a helpto temptations and that Christian people
   who are much tormented by Satan would do well to mix more often with
   other Believers, and tell out their sorrows. A good burst of tears and
   a narration of your grief to a sympathetic friend may be the best
   possible way for you to find relief from your sorrows. Do not be so
   shut up within yourself as to refuse to tell of the heartache that is
   wearing into your very soul--seek help from some Christian Brother or
   Sister, for we are bid to bear one another's burdens, and

   1 trust we are not slow to do so. Having thus introduced the general
   subject of temptation at rather unusual length, I want, now, to speak
   with some brevity, but to practical purpose concerning the temptation
   of our LORD.

   The text I have taken shows that Satan is apt at writing prefaces. He
   is cunning and crafty, if not wise. He does not come to the Savior and
   say at once, "Command that these stones be made bread," but he begins
   thus, "If You are the Son of God." This is his old plan of insinuating
   doubts, by which Eve was vanquished in the Garden of Eden! And this is
   the sharp end of the wedge with which he thought to separate the Son of
   God from His Father. And notice, too, that Satan knows how to fire a
   double-shotted gun, for, while he began by insinuating doubt--"If You
   are the Son of God"--he linked it with rebellion--"Command that these
   stones be made bread." Thus there were two temptations at the same
   moment and, sometimes, our mind is greatly perplexed and our heart is
   wounded by two attacks at one time, or one following very closely upon
   the heels of the other. It is a part of Satan's tactics to be quick
   with his temptations so that we scarcely recover from one blow before
   he deals another--and then another--that, if possible, he may drive us
   out of our wits and overcome us by his cunning.

   I. Let us look closely into this double temptation with which he
   attacked the Savior. "If You are the Son of God, command that these
   stones be made bread." And notice, first, that THE TEMPTER BEGINS BY
   ASSAILING THE

   SAVIOR WITH AN, "IF."

   Note that he does not begin with a point-blank denial, saying, "You are
   not the Son of God," but he suggests a doubt upon the point--"IYou are
   the Son of God." At the present time there is a spirit of infidelity
   creeping over the Christian Church and it puzzles and perplexes me to
   lay hold of it because of its very vagueness. Ministers and others of
   the modern-thought school do not positively assert that the Scriptures
   are not Inspired, but they have a theory of inspiration which
   practically comes to that conclusion. They do not actually say that
   Jesus Christ is not the Son of God, but they try to explain away His
   Divinity in such a fashion that they might just as well deny it at
   once. As for the Fall--oh, of course, there was a fall, but it was a
   matter of very small importance and the idea that the serpent tempted
   Eve is held up to positive ridicule as a myth, an ancient fable! The
   depravity of the human heart is admitted in words, but it is really
   denied when you come to see what those words actually mean. There is a
   new theology, lately sprung up, which has taken every pea out of the
   pod and every kernel out of the shell--and its advocates present us
   with the empty shucks and shells and say, "Do not quarrel with us. We
   are all brothers and there is very little difference between what we
   hold and what you teach, only we are not so dogmatic and positive as
   you are." Yet, all the while, they are throwing doubts upon that which
   is our very life! And we cannot help feeling that they have learned the
   devil's way of dealing with the Truth of God--"If, if, if."

   That is just how Satan comes to each Believer. He will not positively
   say, "You are not a child of God," but he tries to inject a doubt into
   our minds, "fyou are a child of God." He will not declare that Christ's
   people will certainly perish, but he asks, "Suppose they should?"
   Often, when I have heard a great many suppositions, I have felt more
   indignation at them than I have ever felt at a point-blank denial.
   Somebody once said to Mr. Gough, "Now, Mr. Gough, suppose you were in a
   beer parlor." Mr. Gough said, "I will not allow you to suppose anything
   of the kind! With my convictions about the drink traffic, I will not
   have you suppose such a thing!" And I do not know what better answer he
   could have given. Yet people come to us with their supposing and
   insinuations--and we feel as indignant as Mr. Gough did. It is the
   devil's plan to assail with an, "if," and we have met with many who
   have adopted his tactics. One says, "I am not an infidel. I am not a
   freethinker! I am practically the same as you are. I hold the same
   views, I subscribe to the same creed, I am in the same Union and
   Association!" Yet, as we go on talking with him, he undermines the
   whole thing with some dreadful, dreary, "if," concerning the faith
   which we hold dear.

   Notice, next, that the devil grafts his, "if," upon a holy thing. He
   says, "If You are the Son of God." This is the very title that had been
   applied to Christ by His Father at His Baptism--"This is My beloved
   Son." Yet Satan attacks it by trying to graft an, "if," on it. Thus
   does the devil still seek to do with every precious Truth of God and we
   must be always on the watch against him as those who are not ignorant
   of his devices. What a blessed stock is that glorious Doctrine of the
   Adoption of Believers into God's family, but, with an, "if," grafted
   upon it, what sour grapes it bears! It is with great joy we sing--

   "Behold what wondrous Grace The Father has bestowed On sinners of a
   mortal race, To call them sons of God!"

   But put an, "if," on it, and then, ah, me! All the joy and all the
   wonder vanish at once.

   Moreover, on this occasion, Satan put an, "if," upon a plain utterance
   of God. The Father had said, "This is My beloved Son," yet this
   impudent fiend dares, in the face of God's Only-Begotten, to quote that
   title with an, "if," added to it. I am never afraid of what any text of
   Scripture may teach, but I am often afraid of the gloss that has been
   put on a text and this Satanic glossing is the most mischievous of all
   mischief! It matters not how plainly any Truth may be revealed in the
   Scriptures, nor how clear is the language in which it is stated, so
   that we can see that it is certainly taught to us by God, but the devil
   will come and put an, "if," on it. I suppose that some of us who have
   been Christians for many years have had to fight over every Doctrine in
   the Word of God. There is scarcely one Truth of God I believe for which
   I have not had to contend in my own soul. David said that he rejoiced
   over God's Word "as one that finds great spoil." Now, spoil is found
   after a battle, and God's Truth is, to most of His people, a thing for
   which they have had to fight with the powers of darkness and they have
   had to take the Doctrine from the enemy by main force through the aid
   of the Holy Spirit. "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty?" No, that
   which has been gained in battle by such soul-conflict as we have had
   shall be held fast till we die! Yet, while we say this, we know that
   Satan has the impertinence to come and write over many of the great
   Truths of Scripture his ugly, insinuating, "if."

   Yes, and not only does he put an, "if," on Scripture, but he puts an,
   "if," also on past manifestations. You enjoyed, some time ago, a
   blessed visit from God. You thought that you never could forget it--you
   said that you would never doubt again. The sacred Dove rested upon you
   and you were full of holy calm. The voice and witness of the Spirit
   were within you and you knew that you were a child of God and that you
   lived in Jehovah's love. But the devil will come and say to you, "All
   that was fancy and excitement! There was nothing in it." Or if he is
   not so positive, he questions it with an, "if." With his great black
   pen, he scrawls, "if," right across all our sweet experiences, all the
   tops of Tabor--all the communion tables where we have met our Lord, all
   the places of secret retirement where our soul has been made like the
   chariots of Amminadib! And then, unless our Lord comes to our help, we
   lose the comfort of these past manifestations.

   In this case, the devil puts an, "if" across nearly the whole of
   Christ's life. Our Lord had already had 30 years of retirement and
   preparation for His public ministry. I do not know whether Satan had
   tempted Him while He was in His obscurity, living with His father and
   mother in quiet. One would think that after 30 years of holy
   retirement, there must be a certainty of His being the Son of God, yet
   Satan has a bronze forehead and he says, "if," even to Him after all
   that! Some of us have been more than 30 years in God's ways. Some,
   perhaps, for 50 years have enjoyed the Lord's Presence and blessing,
   yet Satan will come and say, "If--if you are a child of God." Yes, and
   he has whispered that insinuation in the ears of dying saints whose
   faces have begun to glow with the Glory to be revealed! He has
   persecuted them with his cruel, "ifs," even to the last moment! Do not
   be astonished at it, Beloved, for our Lord Jesus Christ had no sin in
   Him-- He had never done anything that could have made His sonship
   questionable, and yet, with a perfectly pure and holy and consecrated
   life before Him, this arch-enemy dares to sneer at it and to spit upon
   it one of his abominable, "ifs." "If You are the Son of God." There was
   our Divine Master, fully assured that He was the Son of God. His
   unerring consciousness told Him that He was so. He knew it, He was sure
   of it, as sure of it as He was of His own existence--and yet the fiend
   dared to say to Him, "If You are the Son of God." And you, Beloved, may
   feel the pulsing of the heavenly life--your heart may beat high with
   immortality--yet the hiss of the old serpent may be heard in your
   spirit, "If you are a child of God." That is his usual mode of attack,
   so be on your guard against it!

   II. But, now, secondly, notice that THE TEMPTER AIMS THE, "IF," AT A
   VERY VITAL PLACE. "If You are the Son of God."

   In like manner, with his poisoned arrow of an, "if," he will attack a
   child of God, sometimes, with doubts as to whether Christ is God. "If
   He is the Son of God." Oh, but that Doctrine of the Godhead of our
   Savior is a thing which we must be prepared to defend even with our
   life, if necessary--we can never give up that great Truth of God! It
   has been assailed all through the history of the Christian Church. The
   devil has seemed to say to his fiendish archers, "Fight neither with
   small nor great, save only with the King of Israel." If he can get men
   to deny the Godhead of Christ, he knows that the chief Truth of God is
   assailed. If that were gone, there would be nothing left that would be
   worth having!

   When he has not assailed the Godhead of Christ, he has often attacked
   our sonship. "Oh," he says, "are you a child of God? You, with all your
   imperfections and infirmities--are you a child of God?" And he puts it
   to you, over and over again, as a matter of question, until, at last,
   you are driven almost out of your wits. This questioning of Satan is
   always with an evil intention. He knows that he is assailing us in a
   very vital place--he is attacking our faith--and faith is vital to a
   Christian. If faith should fail us, then our life has failed us.

   He also, by this means, attacks our childlike spirit, for, if we are
   not children of God, why should we submit to His will? Why should we
   not kick and struggle against our daily trials? If we are childlike, we
   trust, we obey, we believe, we endure, we persevere--but Satan puts an,
   "if," on all that and so he tries to disarm us.

   Moreover, he is here aiming at our Father's honor, for he as much as
   says, "Is He your Father? If He is your Father, why does He allow you
   to be tried as you are? Why are you so poor? Why are you so ill? Why
   are you so depressed in spirit? He certainly does not act towards you
   as if He were your Father." Thus the devil tries to take from us all
   our comfort and all our delight, for if God is not the Father of us who
   believe, then are we orphans, indeed! We are strangers in this land and
   we have no other land to go to if God is not our Father and Heaven is
   not our home. The world has rejected us and if God does not acknowledge
   us, we are, of all men, most miserable. So, Satan attacks us with that,
   "if," in the most tender place where he can most wound us. If he could
   succeed in his assault, he would, indeed, leave us naked, poor and
   miserable. He would prevent our prayers, destroy our patience and
   hinder us in every respect. And he does this that he may then make room
   in our hearts for any other form of temptation that he likes. If you
   are not a child of God and God will not take care of you, then
   something whispers to you, "Take care of yourself. Rob your fellow men.
   Do a dishonest thing, do something or other by which you can escape
   from your present difficulty." This is what Satan is aiming
   at--therefore, my Brothers and Sisters, I earnestly entreat you to look
   well to this vulnerable part--your faith--your firm conviction of your
   sonship in relation to the Most High.

   III. Thirdly, SATAN SUPPORTS HIS, "IF," WITH OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.

   I will dwell only a minute or two upon this point. I think that the
   devil seemed to say to Christ, as he looked round the desert and saw
   that there was not a disciple or friend or anybody about--no guards to
   take care of this Prince of the blood--" You, the Son of God, alone,
   deserted, forsaken, in a wilderness? You, the Son of God?"

   And, sometimes, he has come upon us when we have been all alone. We
   have looked and there was no man to help us. We had to war a warfare
   all by ourselves. Friends were all gone--some were dead, others had
   proved false--and then he said, "You, a child of God? While He would
   have given His angels charge concerning you if you had been one of His
   children, He would not have left you all alone like this."

   And then Satan, with a glance of his cruel eyes all around us, has
   seemed to say, " You are in a desert There is nothing but sand and
   stones--no food to eat, no water to drink, no shrubs or trees to
   shelter you. This is a pretty place for a child of God! Why, surely, if
   you had been one of His children, you would have been in a paradise!
   Was not that where God put Adam? How can you be a child of God and be
   in a desert?" Has he ever said something like this to you, Beloved?
   "You have had trials all around you. Losses, crosses, bereavements,
   afflictions, poverty--nothing but troubles and nobody to help you out
   of them." And you have echoed the devil's words, "Alone and in a
   desert!" And then the question has come, "Can I really be a child of
   God?"

   Our Lord was also with the wildbeastsand I have no doubt that Satan
   pointed them out to Him, and said, " You, the Son of God, along with
   lions and bears and leopards and wolves?" So, sometimes, you have gone
   out into what has been a desert to you and all day long you have been
   among wild beasts. When you have been at work, you have not heard a
   word to comfort or cheer you--you have been surrounded by blasphemers
   and filthy talkers. You have said, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in
   Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar." The misery of your
   surroundings has gone right home to your heart and then the devil has
   said, "You, a child of God, and put into such a position as this?"

   Then, last of all, we read that Jesus hungered. And, after 40 days
   fasting, well He might--and hunger is a hard thing to overcome. It
   bites and gnaws most terribly. It was then that the devil said to Him,
   "If you are the Son of God," and threw a sardonic sneer into it--"a
   hungeringSon of God!" So, you see, Satan backs up his insinuations by
   appealing to the circumstances in which we are found. And I will put it
   to you now, whether there is anybody here--even the very bravest of
   us--who could endure such temptation as this!

   Suppose you had to go out of that door, tonight, with ragged garments
   on you, without a single penny in your pocket, without a solitary
   friend left and no place where you could lay your head? Do you not
   think that it is very likely that you would begin to be afraid that,
   after all, you were not a child of God? Supposing that you had eaten
   nothing all this day, and for many days before, and you were faint and
   weary, and no man gave you anything--if the devil said to you, then,
   "If you are a child of God," I am afraid that you would say, "Ah,
   Satan, now that it has come to this pass, I am afraid that I am not!"

   Or I will put it in another way. If there should knock at your door,
   tonight, a man without shoes on his feet, one who had nowhere to sleep,
   and was all in rage, and he told you that he had not broken his fast
   for days, would you believe that he was one of your Brothers in Christ,
   and that he was a child of God? Well, perhaps, you might, but I know a
   good many who would not--they would say, "No, no, no! You are an
   impostor and if you do not leave, I will call in a policeman." Do you
   see, then, what pith and force there is in the temptation, when,
   finding the Savior without a place to lay His head, hungering, alone,
   with the wild beasts and in a wilderness, the devil comes to Him, and
   says, "Are you, indeed, the Son of God?" It was only the true Son of
   God who could answer him with confidence when in such a plight as that!

   IV. To close my discourse, let me remind you that IF THE TEMPTER CAN BE
   OVERCOME, IT WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY HELPFUL TO US ALL THE REST OF OUR
   LIFE.

   For, first, note that, if an, "if," about our being a child of God
   comes from the devil, it is as good as a certificate stating we
   are!"Oh," you say, "how is that?" Why, the devil never puts an, "if,"
   to anything that is not true! Whenever he says, "if," to a thing, we
   may be sure that it is true! If he comes along and finds a text of
   Scripture, and says, "If it is true," that is the best homage which he
   can pay to it by trying to undermine it! I believe that your sonship is
   true when the devil tells you that it is not! If you were not a child
   of God, the devil would not be likely to utter an, "if," about it. I
   hope I am not, in any sense, a servant of the devil, and whenever I see
   anyone in my congregation who is puffed up with carnal conceit and who
   thinks that he is a child of God, I say to myself, "I will try to
   preach, next Sunday, in such a way as to make him question whether he
   is or is not a Christian, for he ought most seriously to question it."
   It is true, as Cowper says--

   "He that never doubted of his state,

   He may perhaps--perhaps he may--too late."

   It is no part of the devil's work to make the self-deceived and
   hypocrites question themselves--he rather lulls them into deeper
   slumber--but when he does suggest to any man the doubt, "If you are a
   child of God," you may depend upon it that the man is a child of God,
   or else the devil would never think it worth his while to raise a
   question about it! So you may take Satan's insinuation for a
   certificate of your sonship!

   When you are once able to battle with his evil suggestion, you may say,
   "If I were Satan's own, he would not worry me. If I belonged to him, he
   would try to make me content in his service--and these doubts and
   fears, these questions, this self-examination, these great searching of
   heart are all evidences that I have escaped from the talons of the old
   dragon and that he worries me because he cannot devour me." So we get a
   confirmation of our sonship even from Satan, himself!

   Thus, dear Fiends, if you once thoroughly overcome that "if," it is
   very likely that it will not occur to you again for many a day, for, as
   far as I know, our blessed Lord had not that, "if," put to Him any more
   for years. The devil departed and angels came and ministered to Him,
   and He spoke with a holy confidence and joy in His Father's love all
   the rest of His life. At the last, when He was in a still worse plight
   and His hands were nailed to the Cross, and He was faint with thirst
   and near to death, then cruel men stood around Him and repeated the
   Satanic insinuation, "If You are the Son of God." Oh, but our blessed
   Master must have inwardly smiled as He thought, "You cannot tempt Me
   with that, 'if,'--I have been tempted, long ago, by a far greater
   adversary than any of you--even by your master and lord, the
   arch-fiend, himself! In the wilderness, he said to Me, 'If You are the
   Son of God,' and I repulsed him, and turned the edge of his sword upon
   himself. And now you have only tried to pierce me with a blunted
   weapon--you cannot wound Me as you cry, 'If You are the Son of God.'"
   Do you not see, Brothers and Sisters, that a temptation overcome may be
   used, the next time, to overcome another one? You may lay up this
   conquered temptation, just as David laid up Goliath's sword and, one of
   these days, when you come the same way and need a sword, you will say,
   "There is none like it! Give it to me." And you will be glad to get the
   old sword into your hand again. So, temptations vanquished may be of
   service to us even on our dying bed and, as our Master triumphed on the
   Cross over a temptation which He had defeated in the desert, so, when
   we come to die, we may have peace and joy because of those early trials
   in which we were enabled to overcome our great adversary by the blood
   of the Lamb.

   I have been all this while talking to God's children about the "if."
   Yet I fear that I am addressing some to whom the devil will not say,
   "if," for he knows, and perhaps your own conscience knows, that you are
   not a child of God. O dear Friends, do not deceive yourselves about
   this matter! If you are not His children, do not pretend that you are,
   but remember that if you are not the children of God, you are children
   of the Evil One and heirs of wrath, even as others. Oh, may Infinite
   Mercy adopt you into the family of God! And the way that mercy works is
   by leading you to trust in Christ Crucified. Then you shall be put
   among the children--adopted into the Lord's family--yes, born into it
   by a new birth through faith in Jesus Christ! The Lord grant it to
   every unconverted one here and grant it now, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 3:13-17; 4:1-11.

   Matthew 3:13, 14. Then came Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to
   be baptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be
   baptized of You, and do You come to me.?Who among us would not have
   felt as John did? Shall the servant baptize the Master and such a
   Master even his Lord and Savior? But mark the condescension of our
   blessed Lord! He would do everything that He wished His people to do
   afterwards and, therefore, He would be baptized and set the example
   that He would have them all follow.

   15. And Jesus answering said unto him, Allow it to be so now: for thus
   it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him. We are
   never to be so modest as to become disobedient to Christ's commands! We
   have known some who have allowed their humility to grow alone in the
   garden of their heart without the other sweet flowers that should have
   sprung up side by side with it--and thus their very humility has
   developed into a kind of pride. John was easily persuaded to do what
   his feelings, at first, seemed to forbid. "Then he allowed Him."

   16, 17. And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the
   water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw the Spirit
   of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him: and lo, a Voice
   from Heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am wellpleased.
   It has also happened unto the servants of Christ, as well as to their
   Master, that in keeping the Commandments of God there has been a sweet
   attestation borne by the Holy Spirit. I trust that we, too, according
   to our measure of sonship, have heard in our hearts the Voice from
   Heaven, saying, "This is My beloved son," and that we have experienced
   the descending of the dove-like Spirit, bringing us peace of mind and
   gentleness of nature.

   Matthew 4:1. Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to
   be tempted of the devil What a change it seems from the descent of the
   Holy Spirit to being led up into the wilderness to be tempted of the
   devil! Dear Friends, be especially on the watch after a great spiritual
   joy, for it is just then that you may have some terrible temptation!
   Perhaps the voice from Heaven is to prepare you to do battle with the
   enemy. I have noticed that the Lord has two special seasons of blessing
   His people--sometimes, before a great trial, to prepare them for
   it--and, at other times, after a great affliction, to remove the
   weakness which has been thereby occasioned. Think not that you can come
   up out of the waters of Baptism and then live without watchfulness!
   Imagine not, because the Spirit has sealed you, and borne witness with
   your spirit that you are the Lord's child, that, therefore, you are out
   of gunshot of the enemy. Oh, no! At that very time he will be preparing
   his most subtle temptations for you, just as Jesus was led up by the
   Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil immediately after
   His Baptism and His Father's testimony, "This is My beloved Son, in
   whom I am well pleased."

   2. And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He afterward was
   hungry. I suppose that He was not "hungry" during His long fast, and
   this renders it a fast altogether by itself. We are here told, "He
   afterward was hungry."

   3. And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of
   God, command that these stones be made bread. "You can do it if You
   are, indeed, the Son of God. You are hungry, therefore feed Yourself.
   Your Father has forgotten You. His Providence has failed You! Be Your
   own Providence--work a miracle for Yourself." How little the tempter,
   with all his knowledge, understood the true Character of Christ! Our
   Lord never worked a miracle in order to supply His own needs.

   4. But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
   bread, alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
   He had been attacked as a man who was hungry, so He quoted a text which
   evidently belonged to man--"Man shall not live by bread, alone." It was
   a wilderness text. It concerned the children of Israel in the desert,
   so it was suitable to the position of our Lord in that wilderness. He
   meant to let the tempter know that as God once fed man by manna from
   the skies, He could do it again. At any rate, this glorious Man, this
   true Son of God, was determined not to interfere with the ordinary
   working of Providence, but He left Himself and His needs in His
   Father's hands.

   5, 6. Then the devil took Him up into the Holy City and set Him on a
   pinnacle of the Temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God,
   cast Yourself down: for it is written, He shall give His angels charge
   concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any
   time you dash your foot against a stone. "It is written." Thus the
   devil tried to turn Christ's own sword against Himself--that two-edged
   sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God! And the devil can still
   quote Scripture to suit his own purpose. Yet it was a misquotation as
   to the letter of it, for he left out the essential words, "to keep you
   in all your ways." And it was a worse misquotation as to the spirit of
   it, for in the true meaning of the passage there is nothing to tempt us
   to presumption. There is a guarantee of safety when we are walking
   where we should walk, but not in leaping from a temple's pinnacle down
   into the abyss!

   7. Jesus said to Him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord
   your God. Here was a plain, positive precept, which clearly forbade
   Christ to tempt God by such a presumptuous action as casting Himself
   down from the pinnacle of the Temple! And we must always follow the
   precepts of Scripture whatever the tempter may say.

   8. Again, the devil took Him up into an exceedingly high mountain
   andshowedHim all the kingdoms ofthe world, and the glory of them.
   Notice that these temptations were in high places. Alas, high places
   are often full of trial, whether they are places of wealth and rank, or
   of eminent service in the Church of God. A pinnacle is a dangerous
   position, even if it is a pinnacle of the Temple. And the summit of an
   exceedingly high mountain is a perilous place even if the view from it
   is not the poverty of the city, nor the sin of the people, but the
   glory of the kingdoms of the world. Even with such a view as that, the
   mountain's brow is full of danger to our weak heads.

   9. And said to Him, All these things will I give You, if You will fall
   down and worship me. Why, they were Christ's already! They never
   belonged to Satan and, though, for a while, he had, to some extent,
   usurped authority over them, it was only his impudence to offer to give
   away what was not his own!

   10. Then Jesus said to Him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written,
   You shall worship the Lordyour God, andHim only shall you serve. Let
   the bribe be what it may, you must not worship or serve either yourself
   or the devil! Your God alone claims your homage. And if the whole earth
   might be yours through one act of sin, you would not be justified in
   committing it.

   11. Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered
   unto Him. What a change! When the devil goes, the angels come! Perhaps
   some of you are just now sorely tempted and much troubled. Oh, that you
   might speedily come to Mahanaim, of which we read, "And Jacob went on
   his way, and the angels of God met him"--that there you might be met by
   troops of angels coming to minister to you, weary with the conflict
   with the Evil One, just as they ministered to your Lord! You need them
   as much as He did and, therefore, you are as sure to have them if you
   look up to Him and ask Him to send them to you.

Strange Things

   (No. 2614)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 19, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 18, 1883.

   "We have seen strange things today." Luke 5:26.

   THE world is growing very old, dull and commonplace. One takes the
   newspaper and, often, after glancing through it, has to say, "There is
   really nothing in it." The reason probably being that there is nothing
   fresh or new happening on the earth--it is the same old sad story of
   sin and sorrow constantly repeated. The world seems to be like a
   cluster from the vine when all its generous juice has been pressed out.
   Life, to many persons, has come to be excessively humdrum. The human
   mind is always craving after novelties and, to find these novelties, it
   makes "much ado about nothing." It runs raving mad over that which is
   not worth thinking of and whips itself up into an intense excitement
   about a matter that is of no more importance than a drop in a bucket,
   or the small dust of the balance. The fact is, man wants something
   really fresh and strange and if he can get it, he feels delighted! I
   hardly think that when our good friend, Mr. John Ashworth, brought out
   his book, he would have achieved so great a success with it if he had
   not called it Strange Tales. But the strangeness was the attraction.
   The stories in it were strange tales to the mass of mankind, though to
   some of us they are very familiar things--but the strangenesswas the
   point that attracted readers.

   No man ever spent a day with Jesus Christ without being filled with the
   sight of strange things! No man ever entered into communion with the
   Lord Jesus without being delighted with wonders of love, of mercy, of
   Divine Grace, of the Truths of God, of goodness for, while His Gospel
   is the old, old Gospel, yet it always has a new face upon it and is
   continually fresh and new--it never gets stale! We read of our Lord
   that when John saw Him, "His head and His hairs were white like wool,
   as white as snow," to denote His antiquity. And yet the spouse said of
   Him, "His locks are bushy and black as a raven," as if to indicate His
   perpetual youth, His unfailing strength and His unfading beauty.
   Believe me, dear Friends, if you want to see that which is truly
   strange, you must get into that spiritual realm where Christ is
   acknowledged as King, the new Heaven and new earth wherein dwell
   righteousness.

   If you want to continue to be astounded, amazed, astonished, filled
   with holy awe, you must come and be familiar with the Savior, His
   person, His work, His offices and everything that has to do with Him
   and, when you have become familiar with all these things, then you will
   have to say constantly, "We have seen strange things today. Something
   has occurred that has surprised even us who have grown used to
   surprises. Our Lord has seemed to outdone Himself, though we thought
   Him to be higher than the heavens--and His mercy has appeared to go
   deeper than ever before, though we judged that it had already gone
   deeper than the abyss, itself!" "O world of wonders! I can say no
   less." He that enters this spiritual world where Christ is adored as
   God and King has unlocked a cabinet of marvels that shall astonish him
   during all his lifetime here and even throughout eternity! I am going
   to speak about strange things and I pray that God will make what is
   said to be of service to many.

   I. First, I ask you to MARK THE STRANGE THINGS OF THAT PARTICULAR DAY
   which are mentioned in our text. It was so full of wonders that the
   people said, "We have seen strange things today." Well, what did they
   see?

   First, they had that day seen Christ disturbed in preaching, greatly
   disturbed, and yet delighted to be so disturbed and accepting the
   disturbance as part of His usual experience and the means of doing
   further good to men. The Lord Jesus has gone into the square covered
   court of a house--the people have pressed in behind Him, one after
   another, till they are packed in a dense mass--and there are still
   others around the door vainly trying to enter. Here come four men--it
   is rather remarkable that there should be four such earnest men--who
   have brought a sick neighbor on his bed, with ropes tied to the four
   corners. But they find that they cannot get in through the crowd. They
   push, they squeeze, they struggle, but there is no getting in! And
   their poor paralyzed friend seems to be effectually shut out from
   Christ. They go up the outside stairs of the house. They get on the
   roof which covers the square where Christ and the people are--and they
   begin ripping off the tiling! And now, look! The man is being let down
   by the four ropes right before the Savior's face! There must be some
   measure of dust, even if something still heavier does not come tumbling
   down upon the Preacher's head, but here comes the bed with the man on
   it! The people are sure to make room for him, now, or else he will be
   supported on their heads! They seemed to be squeezed as tightly as they
   could be, but they feel that they must, somehow or other, get a little
   more closely together and so the man is gradually let down by his four
   friends who carefully let out the four ropes at the same rate, keeping
   good time together, lest one end of the bed should be too high and he
   should fall.

   That must have been a great disturbance to our Lord! I know some
   preachers who cannot bear to have even a baby crying during the sermon.
   I do not feel especially delighted with that sweet music, yet I rejoice
   that the good woman did not stay away from the service! As far as I am
   concerned, she may bring her baby, even if it should sometimes cry--I
   am glad to have her here that God may bless her. Perhaps a friend has
   just dropped his cane in the aisle and made a loud noise just when the
   preacher was trying to be very earnest. Well, that is a pity, but the
   dear Savior was much more rudely interrupted by all the falling stuff
   from the ceiling and the sick man coming down into the midst of the
   crowd before Him! If there had been any "thread" in His sermon, He
   certainly would have lost it--but His discourses were made of better
   material than that. They were made, indeed, of fire, and fell like
   fire-flakes on men's heads and hearts. He still spoke on, after He had
   paused a while to attend to this man's case, and He did attend to it
   very sweetly. He looked at the four men who had brought him and He saw
   that they had great trust in Him. And, seeing their faith, He worked
   the cure upon the sick man.

   It was a strange thing that it should be so, but how much I would like
   to see more of this strange kind of work! I don't know where I am to
   find four men who are so in love with one of their friends that they
   will break up ceilings and roofs to get him where Christ can bless him!
   They will probably be four very imprudent and rash men, in the opinion
   of others--the Lord bless the imprudent and the rash! They are
   generally the best sort of men for such a task as this. Your more
   prudent men would have stopped till the service was over and the people
   had come out and, very likely, they would have waited till Christ had
   gone out at another door--and so their friend would have missed Him.
   But these rash, headstrong, ardent lovers of their sick neighbor must
   somehow get him to Christ! So they break up the roof and there he is,
   right in the Presence of Christ! It was a strange thing to do, but,
   Brothers and Sisters, do not hesitate to do strange things in order to
   save souls! Hardly mind what you do, so long as you can get them to
   Christ. Your Lord will not blame you. He is so strangely loving--so
   strangely full of goodwill to men--that even should you be guilty of an
   indiscretion in your zeal, He will not upbraid you for it. Oh, labor
   for the souls of your children, your servants, your neighbors--and the
   Lord will accept that service, and you may yet have the delight of
   seeing them made whole by Christ! That was a strange thing to begin
   with. I am bound to say that the people who witnessed it talked all
   their lives about the man coming down from the ceiling and Jesus Christ
   healing Him!

   But now they saw a greater wonder than that--the Christ of God
   forgiving this man his sins! We talk about the forgiveness of sins, I
   fear, rather glibly, without always realizing what a great thing it is.
   You know that when Martin Luther was in deep distress of soul, a good
   old monk said to him, "Brother, can you not say the Credo?" "Yes," said
   Luther. "Well, then," replied the old man, "in the Credo you say, 'I
   believe in the forgiveness of sins.'" "Yes," said Luther, "I know that.
   I have often said it." "Then," enquired the other, "do you believe in
   the forgiveness of your own sin? For, if not, how can you say, 'I
   believe in the forgiveness of sins'?" This great Truth is sometimes
   spoken of as though forgiveness were an impalpable something that was
   done and yet not done, but Christ never meant it to be so. His death
   was not a shadowy, vague Atonement that might possibly be available for
   sinners, but a real and complete putting away of sin and, as many as
   believe in Him may know for sure that their sin is put away and is as
   completely gone as if it had actually ceased to be, seeing that Christ
   bore the punishment of it. Yes, and the sin, itself, was, by
   imputation, laid upon Him, as it is written, "The Lord has laid on Him
   the iniquity of us all." "He was wounded for our transgressions, He was
   bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him
   and with His stripes we are healed."

   Whenever a sinner has his sin forgiven, it is a strange, a wondrous
   thing! Never think of it as a mere commonplace matter of no account,
   for it is a marvel of marvels. The angels--a far nobler race than
   men--fell from their first estate, but never has any of the devils bean
   pardoned for his rebellion against the Most High. No Savior has
   espoused their cause, no sacrifice has been offered for their guilt, no
   Gospel is ever proclaimed in their ears! When they sinned, they fell
   finally and now they are "reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
   unto the judgment of the great day." Yet man, who was not a pure
   spirit, like the angels, but a spirit allied with materialism, an
   inferior being, fell--and for him God left His throne to come and bleed
   on earth to offer up an expiation! For men, sin became pardonable! No,
   more, to multitudes of the sons of men sin has been forgiven and an act
   of amnesty and oblivion has been passed concerning their rebellion!
   What a wonderful Truth of God is this! Whenever you feel a sense of
   pardoned sin, or whenever you know that your fellow man has received
   absolution from the great High Priest, the Son of God, you may at once
   say, "We have seen strange things today."

   When these people around our Lord had seen that wonder, they saw
   something else which must have greatly surprised them--they saw an
   exhibition of thought-reading. I have heard and read many curious
   things about thought-reading. Some I have believed, and some I have
   not. That any man can read my thoughts, I shall take leave to question!
   At any rate, he may read this thought, for I will tell him what is on
   my mind--that I do not believe him! But our Lord Jesus Christ, as He
   looked at the Pharisees and the scribes, read their unexpressed
   thoughts and, at once, saw what was passing within their minds! It was
   not an easy thing, I should think, to read thoughts like these, "Who is
   this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God, alone?"
   But our Lord Jesus read those thoughts and answered them, though the
   men before Him had not as yet spoken a single word! I have seen
   wonderful exhibitions of thought-reading in this Tabernacle--not by me,
   but by the Lord Himself! Many of you are witnesses of how I have
   uttered from this platform the very words you have spoken when you were
   coming here--and what you said in your bedchamber, where nobody heard,
   perhaps, but some one companion, has been repeated in this place and
   you have been astounded as you discovered that the Word of God, which
   is quick and powerful, searches the heart and cuts asunder, just as you
   have seen an animal split from head to foot by a butcher and its
   innermost parts laid bare to the view of every passerby!

   The Word of God often does that--discovers the secret thoughts and
   intents of the heart and makes the man see himself as God sees him--and
   makes him stand astonished that it should be so! We have frequently
   seen this sort of thing happen as we sometimes tell to one another some
   of the extraordinary instances in which men's very flesh has seemed to
   creep as the things they said and did have been made known to them. It
   will probably happen in like manner to many others--and those to whom
   God will thus speak will say, as these people did--"We have seen
   strange things today."

   There was another strange thing they saw and, with that, I will
   conclude this first part of my discourse. They saw a sick man who could
   not lift hand or foot made, in a single moment, to walk and carry his
   bed, at the word of the Lord, Jesus Christ! That must have been a
   strange sight to those who knew this poor paralyzed man, when they saw
   him stand up from the bed and glorify God as he did what Jesus bade him
   do. And when the Lord speaks with power to a soul, as He constantly
   does, and the man who knew not God learns to know Him, and the one who
   feared not the Lord is brought to trust and love and serve Him, what a
   marvelous thing it is! I sometimes wonder whether any person would
   doubt the Inspiration of Scripture and the Divine origin and power of
   the Gospel if he could live each day as I live and see what I see of
   the wonders that are worked by the Gospel. Last Sunday night there came
   into Exeter Hall a man who did not care for the things of God, but he
   sat and heard the sermon. His brother had brought him--and was praying
   earnestly for him. As he was going out, a friend, who had observed him
   during the service, said to this man who had entered the hall utterly
   careless and Christless, "You were interested in the sermon tonight,
   were you not?" "I was," he answered, "very much." "Do you believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ?" The man at once replied, "I do believe in Him
   with all my heart and all my soul." His brother, who was with him, and
   who had been praying over him, said, "I was astonished beyond measure
   to hear him make such a declaration of his faith!"

   Beside that one, there were 12 other persons who came forward when the
   service was over and distinctly declared that they had found the Savior
   that night under the preaching of the Gospel. Though they had not been
   religious people, and had scarcely ever thought of their souls, yet God
   had found them! And these strange things do not occur with us,
   alone--they happen every day with our beloved friends, Moody and Sankey
   and, indeed, in a great measure, with all who preach the Gospel! It is
   its own evidence of its almighty power and, as it wins its way, men are
   saved, they are healed of the deadly paralysis of sin and made to leap
   with active obedience and joyful service in the cause of Christ!
   Whenever you see this miracle of mercy worked, you can say, "We have
   seen strange things today." ' II. Now, with great brevity, I ask you TO
   MARK THE STRANGE THINGS OF CHRIST'S DAY.

   If you had ever beheld our Lord's life and work with the eyes of faith,
   you must have seen many strange things. First, the Maker of men became
   a Man! He that is Infinite became an Infant--He that made all things
   was wrapped in swaddling clothes! He who fills all space was laid in a
   manger and the Son of the Highest was known as the Son of Mary! We have
   heard strange things when we have heard the Doctrine of the
   Incarnation! "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld
   His Glory, the Glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of
   Grace and truth." Truly, this was a strange thing!

   Further, He who was Lord of All, became Servant of All! "Being found in
   fashion as a Man," He lived a life of perfect obedience to His Father's
   will and went about healing the sick, raising the dead and ministering
   to all who came near Him. Most marvelous of all, on Him who knew no
   sin, the sin of man was laid, and the righteous God meted out to Him,
   the Innocent One, the chastisement due to the guilty! This is the
   ground of our hope and the only foundation of hope for sinners, that
   He, the innocent Christ, was made sin for us, "that we might be made
   the righteousness of God in Him." But what a wonder it is! The guilty
   go free because He who is free from guilt suffers in their place! Tell
   all men that wonder of wonders!

   Yet that was not all. Jesus died on the Cross! And loving friends laid
   Him in the tomb. Death had conquered Him, but, in that moment, Death
   was conquered--

   "He Death by dying slew."

   That day He led Death, itself, captive to His own supremacy. Wonder of
   wonders--Death put to death by death! Jesus Christ, by His dying, puts
   dying out of the way for all His people. Yet, even that wonder is not
   the last. Look, there He lies, for a while, wrapped in the grave
   clothes and Death appears to have the mastery over Him. But that
   Scripture must be fulfilled--"You will not leave My soul in Hades;
   neither will You suffer Your Holy One to see corruption." He must wait
   there till the appointed hour strikes and then, early in the morning,
   before the break of day, He was up and away! An angel rolled away the
   stone, for He that had been dead was alive, again, and Jesus left the
   abode of Death, no more to die! What a wonder it is that He who was
   dead worked out our resurrection! And now, since He rose from the
   grave, so all His followers must.

   You may take what point you please in the history of the Lord Jesus
   Christ and, if you really understand it, you will say concerning every
   part of it, "We have seen strange things" in this matter. It is a chain
   of miracles! It is like Alps on Alps and more than that, for the
   mountains of mercy tower above the stars and reach even to the Throne
   of God and God, Himself, was never more lofty and glorious than when He
   was occupied in the stupendous labors of His Son Jesus Christ. Only
   spend your time in the company of the great Wonder-Worker, and you will
   continually be able to say, "We have seen strange things today."

   III. Now I must close by asking you to MARK THE STRANGE THINGS STILL TO
   BE SEEN IN THOSE IN

   WHOM CHRIST WORKS. If He comes and blesses us, we shall often say, "We
   have seen strange things today."

   First, we have seen a self-condemned sinner justified by Christ. I can
   tell you what I saw, one day, and I never shall forget the sight
   throughout eternity! I saw a sinner whom I know right well--and I can
   say no good of him, but much, very much that is evil, without at all
   slandering him. He had been proud and haughty in his opinion of
   himself, but there shone a light into his soul which unveiled to him
   his deep corruption and depravity, the sin that mixed with all his best
   things, and the still more dreadful sin that fermented in his worst
   things. I saw that sinner--for I know him well--self-condemned. He
   wrote his own sentence and he handed it to the Judge. He said that he
   deserved to be cast away forever from the Presence of God and the Glory
   of His power. And, as he passed up his own death-warrant, he dropped a
   tear upon it and he said, "I now trust myself to the Sovereign Mercy of
   God in Christ Jesus." I remember it well and I saw that self-condemned
   sinner pardoned in a moment! The Lord said to him, "Your sins, which
   are many, are all forgiven," and his face changed from darkness and
   gloom into shining light and joy! And he has never lost the impression
   of that blessed day--and, as he stands here to tell you the story, he
   can truly say that he saw strange things that day! But, Brothers and

   Sisters, there are hosts of you who have undergone the same blessed
   operation! Self-condemnation brought you where the Savior absolved you
   and, though it seems so easy to talk about it now, oh, how blessed it
   was when first we felt it! My heart did leap for joy! I was never so
   happy before and I sometimes think that I have scarcely ever been quite
   as jubilant as I was on that day of holy excitement and exhilaration!

   I remember, also, a natural heart renewed by Divine Grace. I have gone
   into my garden and I have seen a great number of trees that have new
   branches which have been grafted into them, but I never yet saw a tree
   get a new heart. I have seen it get new bark and many changes have
   happened to it, but it cannot change its heart. There are some living
   creatures that shed their claws and grow fresh ones, but I never heard
   of a living creature that grew a new heart. That must be a strange, a
   wondrous thing, to change the very center and source of life! Yet the
   Lord Jesus Christ is constantly doing it--giving men new motives, new
   desires, new wishes, new habits--changing them entirely and,
   especially, creating in them new hearts and right spirits! Whenever you
   see that miracle of Grace worked, you can say. "We have seen strange
   things today." A woman came to see me and cast herself down at my feet.
   She said that she had been such a sinner that she was not fit to speak
   with me. I bade her rise, for I said I, also, was a sinner. And she
   told me what she had been--I will not tell you the sad story, for I
   should have to use words of shame if I described her. But she is among
   us now, washed and sanctified--and she delights to serve her God and
   honor and glorify Him! What changed that woman? Was it fear? No, she
   was a brave spirit who would have dared any kind of devil, but the
   Grace of God changed and transformed her, and made her into a loving
   servant of the living Savior. Oh, whenever we see this deed of Grace
   done--and we see it continu-ally--we say, "We have seen strange things
   today."

   Another marvel is, a soul preserved in spiritual life amid killing
   evils. Did you ever see a bush burn and yet not be consumed? Did you
   ever see a spark float in the sea and yet not be quenched? Many persons
   here are, to themselves, just such wonders. They are living godly lives
   in the midst of temptation--holy in the midst of impurity--serving God
   in spite of all opposition. These are strange things!

   Did you ever see evil turned into good?. There are many of God's
   children who constantly see it. "All things work together for good to
   them who love God." They are made rich by poverty, made healthy by
   sickness, made strong by weakness, made alive by killing, made to go up
   by going down! You who live the new life know the meaning of these
   paradoxes and understand how these strange things make up a Christian's
   progress to the Eternal City of God. Strange things do the people of
   God see in their own lives as they find Heaven on earth! It is a
   singular thing for anyone to be on earth and yet in Heaven, but we have
   proved it to be so! We have seen men sick and we have seen men
   dying--and yet as full of bliss as they could hold, as thankful in
   their room of poverty--and almost as joyful, as if they had been among
   the angels before the Throne of God above! There are surprises all the
   way along the road to Glory, but what will it be when we come to the
   end of it?

   Did you ever try to picture the first half-hour in Heaven? Have you
   ever thought of the sensations that will pass through you in the first
   few days there? I think that we can very well judge what they will be,
   for they have been revealed to us by the Spirit. We shall have the same
   joys as we have here, only carried to a far higher pitch, for the life
   of God in Heaven is the life of God in the heart on earth! Heaven is
   but the outgrowth of a holy consecrated life and he that lives with
   Christ below is already in the lower chamber of the Father's House. He
   has but to climb a pair of stairs and be in the upper chamber where all
   the glorified meet together with their Lord! Still, I doubt not that it
   will be passing strange to go from earth into Glory.

   Whenever I begin to talk about this matter, I always wonder who will be
   the first among us to be called away, for it happens every week that
   some out of our great congregation go Home. Sometimes, in a single
   week, six or seven of our Church members go to the great Father's
   House--whose turn will it be to go next? We have not the choice,
   otherwise some of us might venture to put in an early claim that we
   might enjoy our rest. I know some old folk and some sick ones, and some
   who are greatly beset by Satan, and some who are sorely troubled with
   doubts and fears who would gladly say, "Would God it were time for us
   to go!" Well, dear Friends, rest assured that you are not
   forgotten--the messenger will come to you, perhaps soon, and he will
   say to you, "By tomorrow, you shall see the King in His Glory." You
   will have to go down into the flood--to cross the dark river, as they
   call it--but I do not believe that it is dark at all. I have seen the
   light shining on the faces of many of the pilgrims as they have looked
   back at me, when I have stood upon the river's brink to comfort
   them--and it has not seemed at all dark. The happiest company I ever
   keep is that of dying saints! I come away right merry, sometimes, from
   their bedside, for they say to me, "O dear Pastor, the Truth of God you
   preach is good to live upon and good to die upon!"

   I saw a man and his wife, both of them very ill, lying in bed,
   together, but not a syllable of sympathy did they appear to need from
   me. And they seemed delighted to say to me, "We learned Christ from
   your lips. We have lived on the Gospel you preached and it holds us up,
   now that we are lying here. We are glad to go home to Heaven--we are
   full of life and full of immortality even now!" Oh, yes, these are
   strange things--except to those who form part of this strange company
   with God, who is, to many, a stranger in His own world, and with
   Christ, who is a stranger, sometimes, in His own Church! We can say,
   and we shall say at the close of our lives, "We have seen strange
   things today."

   There is one strange sight which I wish that you, dear Friends, if you
   are unconverted, would look upon--I wish that you would see Jesus as
   your own Savior. He is not far from any one of you. O look, look, look
   at Him and, as you look at Him, you shall live! That is God's appointed
   way of salvation. "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth." And, dear Heart, if you should see that strange
   being--yourself--a saved sinner, I would like you to see another
   strange sight, namely, all your family saved! It will be such joy to
   you to have your wife rejoicing in Christ with you, joining in your
   daily prayer, and your children, even in their childhood, loving their
   father's God. There is a text for you to lay hold of, supposing that
   you are not yet converted. It was the middle of the night when, in
   Philippi, the jail began to rock to and fro. The jailer's house was up
   above, and he knew that he had two strange prisoners down in the vaults
   below. They had been singing in the night and the other prisoners had
   heard them and, as the jail rocked and reeled, and the doors flew open,
   the jailer, a stern Roman legionary, thought that his prisoners must
   have escaped and that he would be put to death for allowing it.

   So he was about to thrust his sword into his own heart, but Paul
   shouted to him, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here." Then, when
   a light was brought, that man fell down before Paul and Silas and said
   to them, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" And they answered,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your
   house." Do not leave out those last three words, "and your house." Do
   not seek your own salvation without that of your household, also! Look
   up the passage in Acts 16:31-34--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   you shall be saved, and your house. And they spoke to him the Word of
   the Lord, and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same
   hour of the night and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he and
   all his, straightway. And when he had brought them into his house, he
   set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
   house."

   It was a midnight service and Baptism of the whole household upon a
   profession of their faith! God send you a like blessing! You will see
   strange things, then! Many of us have seen already them in our families
   and we hope to see them repeated a thousand times! The Lord give you,
   every one, a personal blessing, and then bless your households, also,
   for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 5:12-32.

   Verse 12. And it came to pass, when He was in a certain city, behold, a
   man full of leprosy. What a contrast there was between these two
   persons--the Lord Jesus full of purity--and this man full of
   impurity--full of leprosy! He could not be more than full. He had as
   much leprosy as a man could contain.

   12. Who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought Him, saying, Lord,
   if You will, You can make me clean. This was splendid faith! Here was
   adoration of the noblest kind! No angel before the Throne of God could
   render the Son of God more honor than this poor leprous man did. He
   believed in Christ's power at once to rid him of that otherwise
   incurable disease. "Lord, if You will, You can make me clean."

   13. And He put forth His hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be you
   clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. This is what
   Christ can also do in the spiritual realm. If a man is full of sin, let
   him but fall down on his face before Jesus and say, "Lord, if You will,
   You can make me clean," and the Lord will put out His hand, touch him,
   and he will be clean in a moment. "Immediately," not needing the lapse
   of a single hour--"immediately the leprosy departed from him."

   14. And He charged him to tell no man but go, and show yourself to the
   priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for
   a testimony unto them. As long as the Ceremonial Law was in force,
   Christ very diligently obeyed it and bade others do the same. That Law
   is now abolished and the Jewish priesthood has also ceased to be. But
   mark the modesty of our Savior. As Man, He sought no fame or honor,
   but, as far as He could do so, He suppressed the voices that would have
   brought Him notoriety. Yet grateful tongues could not all be silenced,
   even at His bidding.

   15. But so much the more went there a fame abroad of Him: and great
   multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their
   infirmities. There was s double attraction about the Lord Jesus--His
   sweet, instructive speech, and His gracious, healing hand. There is a
   still somewhat similar attraction in every true Gospel ministry, not
   the attraction of the mere words of human eloquence, but in the Truths
   of God which every faithful minister preaches and in that matchless
   soul-healing power which goes with the Word wherever it is believingly
   heard.

   16. And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed. That is
   just what you and I would probably nothave done under such
   circumstances. We would have said, "We must seize this golden
   opportunity of publishing our message. There is a tide in the affairs
   of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to plenitude of blessing and
   we must take advantage of it." But our Savior did not wish for fame, He
   cared nothing about excitement and popularity, so, "He withdrew Himself
   into the wilderness and prayed" for more of that real power which
   touches the hearts of men so as to save them, caring nothing for that
   power which merely attracts a crowd and excites momentary attention. O
   servant of God, when you are best succeeding in your service, imitate
   your Lord--withdraw yourself and pray!

   17. And it came to pass on a certain days, as He was teaching, that
   there were Pharisees and doctors ofthe law sitting by, which had come
   out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem; and the power
   ofthe Lord was present to heal them. To heal the people? Yes, and to
   heal the doctors, too! And that was a far more difficult thing than to
   heal the ordinary folk. It must have been a time of great mercy and
   favor when Christ was ready to bless even the Pharisees and doctors of
   the law who were sitting by.

   18. And, behold--For it was a great wonder--

   18. Men brought in a bed, a man which was taken with palsy. A paralyzed
   man.

   18, 19. And they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before
   Him. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
   because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop. There was, no
   doubt, a staircase outside, as there usually is to Eastern houses.
   "They went upon the housetop,"

   19-21. And let him down through the tiling with his couch into the
   midst before Jesus. And when He saw their faith, He said unto him, Man,
   your sins are forgiven you. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to
   reason, saying, Who is this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive
   sins, but God alone?Most true, O Pharisees and, therefore, He isGod,
   for He can forgive sins and He has forgiven this poor sinner!

   22, 23. But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He, answering, said
   unto them, What reason you in your hearts? Whether it is easier to say,
   Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, rise up and walk? "Does not each
   of these require the same Divine power? If I am able to bid him rise up
   and walk, I am also able, by the same Divine authority, to forgive his
   sins."

   24-26. But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon earth
   to forgive sins, (He said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto you,
   Arise, and take up your couch, and go into your house. And immediately
   he rose up before them and took up that on which he lay, and departed
   to his own house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed, and they
   glorified God, and were filled with fear With a reverent awe!

   26, 27. Saying, We have seen strange things today. And after these
   things He went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the
   receipt of custom. This Levi, or Matthew, was a tax collector. Not like
   those of our own day, but one who collected the taxes for the Roman
   governor and made what he could for himself out of them. At least that
   is what many of the "publicans" did.

   27, 28. And He said unto him, Follow Me. And he left all, rose up, and
   followed Him. This was just a parallel case to that of curing the
   palsied man--it is precisely the same morally as the other was
   physically. The office of a publican was disreputable in the eyes of
   the Jews, and this Levi was probably making fast money at the cost of
   his own countrymen. He was morally paralyzed as the other man was
   physically,but as soon as Christ said to him, "Follow Me," "he left
   all, rose up, and followed Him."

   29, 30. And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house: and there was
   a great company ofpublicans and of others that sat down with them. But
   the scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why
   do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?'t seems that there can
   never be a great wonder worked by Christ without somebody or other
   objecting to it! I suppose that the sun never rises without annoying
   thieves who would like a longer time to perpetrate their deeds of
   darkness. And no miracle of mercy is ever worked without somebody
   finding fault with it for some reason or other. Be not dismayed,
   therefore, now that in these modern days there have arisen many cunning
   objectors to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Let them object to it, as the
   dog barks at the moon--the moon still shines on in her silver
   brightness! So, when all objectors shall have howled themselves to
   silence, the eternal Gospel will shine on with never-failing splendor.
   These scribes and Pharisees murmured against Christ's disciples and
   said to them, "Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
   Their Master did not leave them to defend themselves, but He took the
   case into His own hands.

   31. And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole--"Such as
   you scribes and Pharisees claim to be

   31. Need not a physician; but they that are sick ' 'You regard them as
   sick and I regard them in the same way and, therefore, am I found where
   these sick ones are. Why should I turn aside from them to insult you,
   who are so wonderfully healthy and think yourselves so good?"

   32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

The Anxious Enquirer

   (No. 2615)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 26, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, EARLY IN THE YEAR 1857.

   "Oh that I knew where I might find Him!" Job 23:3.

   WE will say nothing at this time concerning Job. We will leave the
   Patriarch out of the question and take these words as the exclamation
   forced from the aching heart of a sinner when he finds that he is lost
   on account of sin and can only be saved by Christ. "Oh that I knew
   where I might find Him"--my Savior--"That I might be saved by His love
   and blood!" There are some who tell us that a man, can, if he pleases,
   in one moment obtain peace with God and joy in the Holy Spirit. Such
   persons may know something of religion in their own hearts, but I think
   they are not competent to be judges of others. God may have given them
   some peace through believing and brought them into an immediate state
   of joy--He may have given them some repentance for sin and then quickly
   made them to rejoice in Jesus. But I believe that in many more cases,
   God begins by breaking the stony heart in pieces and often makes a
   delay of days, of weeks and even of months, before He heals the soul
   which He has wounded and gives life to the spirit which He has killed.
   Many of God's people have been, even, for years seeking peace and,
   finding none, they have known their sins, they have been permitted to
   feel their guilt and yet, notwithstanding that they have sought the
   Lord earnestly with tears, they have not attained to a knowledge of
   their justification by faith in Christ.

   Such was the case with John Bunyan. For many a dreary month he walked
   the earth in desolation and said he knew himself to be lost without
   Christ. On his bended knees, with tears pouring like showers from his
   eye, he sought mercy, but he found it not. Terrible words continually
   haunted him! Dreadful passages of Scripture kept ringing in his ears
   and he found no consolation until, afterwards, God was pleased to
   appear unto him in all the plentitude of Divine Grace and lead him to
   cast himself on the Savior!

   I think there may be some here who have been for a long while under the
   hand of God--some who have been brought so far toward Heaven as to know
   that they are undone forever unless Christ shall save them. I may be
   addressing some who have begun to pray--many a time the walls of their
   chamber have resounded with their supplications. Not once, nor twice,
   nor 50 times, but very often have they bent their knees in agonizing
   prayer and yet, up to this moment, so far as their own feelings are
   concerned, their prayers are unanswered. Christ has not smiled upon
   them. They have not received the application of His precious blood and,
   perhaps, each one of them is at this hour saying, "I am ready to give
   up in despair. Jesus said He would receive all who came to Him, but
   apparently He has rejected me." Take heart, O Mourner! I have a sweet
   message for you and I pray the Lord that you may find Christ on the
   spot where you are now standing or sitting--and rejoice in a pardon
   bought with blood!

   I shall now proceed to consider the case of a man who is awakened and
   is seeking Christ, but who, at present, has not, to his own
   apprehension, found Him. First, I shall notice some hopeful signs in
   this man's case. Secondly, I shall try to give some reasons why it is
   that a gracious God delays an answer to prayer in the case of penitent
   sinners. And then, thirdly, I shall close by giving some brief and
   suitable advice to those who have been seeking Christ, but have, up to
   the present time, found it a hopeless search.

   I. First, then, observe that THERE ARE SOME VERY HOPEFUL SIGNS IN THE
   CASE OF THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN SEEKING CHRIST, THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE
   FOUND HIM.

   Taking the text as the basis of observation, I notice as one hopeful
   sign that the man has only one objective--that he may find Christ. "Oh
   that I knew where I might find Him!" The worldling's cry is, "Who will
   show us any good--this good, that good, or any other good--fifty kinds
   of good! Who will show us any of these?" But the quickened sinner knows
   of only one good and he cries, "Oh that I knew where I might find HIM!"
   When the sinner is truly awakened to feel his guilt, if you could pour
   the gold of India at his feet, he would say, "Take it away! I need to
   find HIM." If you could then give him all the joys and delights of the
   flesh, he would tell you he had tried all these and they but soured his
   appetite. His only cry is, "Oh that I knew where I might find HIM!"--

   "These will never satisfy! Give me Christ, or else I die!" It is a
   blessed thing for a man when he has brought his desires into a focus.
   While he has 50 different wishes, his heart resembles a pool of water
   which is spread over a marsh, breeding foul air and pestilence. But
   when all his desires are brought into one channel, his heart becomes
   like a river of pure water, running along and fertilizing the fields.
   Happy is the man who has only one desire, if that one desire is set on
   Christ, even though it may not yet have been realized. If it is his
   desire, it is a blessed sign of the Divine work within him. Such a man
   will never be content with mere ordinances. Other men will go up to
   God's House and when they have heard the sermon, they will be
   satisfied. But not so this man! He will say, "Oh that I knew where I
   might find HIM!" His neighbor, who hears the sermon, will be content,
   but this man will say, "I need more than that! I want to find Christ in
   it." Another man will go to the Communion Table--he will eat the bread
   and drink the wine--and that will be enough for him. But the quickened
   sinner will say, "No bread, no wine, will satisfy me! I need Christ. I
   must have Him! Mere ordinances are of no use to me. I want not the
   Savior's clothes, I want Him! Do not offer me these things--you are
   only bringing me the empty pitcher while I am dying of thirst! Give me
   water, the Water of Life, or I shall die. It is Christ that I want."
   This man's cry is, as we have it here in our text, "Oh that I knew
   where I might find Him!"

   Is this your condition, my Friend, at this moment? Have you but one
   desire, and is that desire that you may find Christ? Then, as the Lord
   lives, you are not far from the Kingdom of Heaven. Have you but one
   wish in your heart, and is that one wish that you may be washed from
   all your sins in Jesus' blood? Can you really say, "I would give all I
   have to be a Christian--I would give up everything I have and hope for
   if I might but feel that I have an interest in the Person and death of
   Christ"? Then, poor Soul, despite all your fears, be of good cheer--the
   Lord loves you and you shall soon come out into the daylight and
   rejoice in the liberty in which Christ makes men free.

   There is another hopeful sign about this anxious enquirer. Not only has
   the man this one desire, but it is an intense desire. Hear the text
   again. "Oh that I knew where I might find Him!" There is an, "Oh,"
   here. This proves an intensity of desire. There are some men who are
   apparently very religious, but their religion is never more than skin
   deep--it does not reach as far as their heart. They can talk of it
   finely, but they never feel it--it does not well up from the heart and
   that is a bad spring that only comes from the lips. But this character
   whom I am describing is no hypocrite--he means what he says. Other men
   will say, "Yes, we would like to be Christians. We would like to be
   pardoned and we would like to be forgiven." And so they would--but they
   would like to go on in sin, too! They would like to be saved, but they
   would also like to live in sin! They want to hold with the hare and run
   with the hounds. They have no desire whatever to give up their
   sins--they would like to be pardoned for all their past
   transgressions--but go on just the same as before. Their wish is of no
   use because it is so superficial! But when the sinner is really
   quickened, there is nothing superficial about him. Then his cry is, "Oh
   that I knew where I might find Him!" and that cry comes from his very
   heart!

   Are you in that condition, my Friend? Is your sigh a real one? Is your
   groan no mere fancy, but a real groan from the heart? Is that tear
   which steals down your cheek a genuine tear of penitence, which is the
   evidence of the grief of your spirit? I think I hear you saying, "Sir,
   if you knew me, you would not ask me that question. My friends say I am
   miserable day after day and so, indeed, I am. I go to my chamber at the
   top of the house and I often cry to God. Yes, Sir, I cry in such a
   style that I would not have anyone hear me. I cry with groans and tears
   that I may be brought near to God. I mean what I say." Then, Beloved,
   you shall be saved! So surely as it is a real emotion of the heart, God
   will not let you perish. Never was there a sinner whose inmost spirit
   cried to the Lord for salvation who was not already loved of God! Never
   was there one who, with all his might, desired to be saved and whose
   soul groaned out that desire in hearty prayer, who was cast away by
   God! His mercy may tarry, but it will come. Pray on--He will hear you
   at last--and you shall yet "rejoice in hope of the glory of God."

   But notice again that in the text there is an admission of ignorance,
   which is another very hopeful sign. "Oh that I knew!" Many people think
   they know everything and, consequently, they know nothing. I think it
   is Seneca who says, "Many a man would have been wise if he had not
   thought himself so. If he had but known himself to be a fool, he would
   have become wise." The doorstep to the Temple of Wisdom is a knowledge
   of our own ignorance. He cannot learn aright who has not first been
   taught that he knows nothing. A sense of ignorance is a very excellent
   sign of Grace. It is an amazing thing that every man seems to think
   himself qualified to be a Doctor of Divinity--a man who knows nothing
   of any other science, fancies he perfectly understands this greatest of
   all sciences and, alas, alas, for those who think they know so much
   about God's things and yet have never been taught of God! Man's school
   is not God's school. A man may go to all the Colleges in creation and
   know as little of theology when he comes out as when he went into them.
   It is a good thing for a man to feel that he is only beginning to learn
   and to be willing to open his mind to the teaching of God's Spirit,
   that he may be guided in everything by Him. He that is foolish enough
   to fancy that he knows everything need not think himself a Christian.
   He that boasts that he understands all mysteries, needs to fear as to
   his true state. But the quickened soul prays to the Lord, "Teach me."
   We become little children when God begins to deal with us. Before that
   we were big, tall, men and women, and oh, so wise! But when He takes us
   in hand, He cuts us down to the stature of children and we put on the
   form of humility to learn the true lessons of wisdom--and then we are
   taught the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. Happy are you, O Man, if
   you know yourself to know nothing! If God has emptied you of your
   carnal wisdom, He will fill you with that which is heavenly. If He has
   taught you your ignorance, He will teach you His wisdom and bring You
   to Himself! And if you are taught to reject all you know and know it,
   God will certainly reveal Himself to you.

   There is one more hopeful sign in my text that I must mention. It is
   this--the person I have spoken of is very careless about where it is he
   seeks Christ, so that he does find Him. Do you know, Beloved, that
   people, when they really feel the weight and the guilt of their sins,
   are the worst people in the world to stick up for denominations? Other
   men can fight with their fellow creatures about various minor matters,
   but a poor awakened sinner says, "Lord, I will be glad to meet You
   anywhere!" When we have never seen ourselves to be sinners, we are the
   most respectable religionists in the world-- we venerate every nail in
   the church or chapel door--and we would not have anyone differ from us
   on any point of doctrine or practice! But when we feel our sins, we
   say, "Lord, if I could find You anywhere, I would be happy. If I could
   find you at the Baptist Meeting House. If I could find you in the
   Independent Chapel, I would be glad enough to go there. I have always
   attended a large, handsome church, but if I could find You in that
   little despised Meeting House, I would be glad to go there. Though it
   would be degrading to my rank and respectability, I would go there to
   find my Savior." Some are foolish enough to think that they would
   rather not have Christ if He goes anywhere except to their own
   church--they must keep to their own denomination and can, by no means,
   overstep the line.

   It is a marvelous thing, but I believe I describe the experience of
   many whom I am now addressing, when I say that there are very few of
   you who were brought to know the Lord where you were in the habit of
   attending. You have, perhaps, worshipped there since you were
   converted, but it was not your father's church, not the place where you
   were born and bred, but some other into which you strayed for a time,
   where the King's arrows stuck fast in your heart! I know it was so with
   me--I never thought of going to the Chapel where I was first brought to
   know the Lord, but it snowed so hard that I could not go to my ordinary
   place of worship, so I was obliged to go to the little Primitive
   Methodist meeting. And when I got in, the preacher read his text--"Look
   unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." It was a blessed
   text and it was blessedly applied to my soul! But if there had been any
   opportunity as to going into other places, I would not have been there!
   So the awakened sinner says, "'Oh that I knew where I might find Him!'
   Only let me know where Christ is to be found! Let the minister be the
   most despised in the world, I will go and hear him! Let the
   denomination to which he belongs be the most calumniated and slandered,
   there I will be found seeking Him! If I can but find Christ, I will be
   content to meet Him anywhere!"

   If divers can go into the deeps to bring up pearls, we should not be
   ashamed, sometimes, to dive deep to bring up precious jewels of Divine
   Grace. Men will do anything to get gold--they will work in the most
   muddy streams, or under the most scorching sun--surely, then, we ought
   not to mind how much we stoop if we find that which is more precious
   than gold and silver, even "Jesus Christ and Him crucified." Is this
   how you feel? Then, Beloved, I have not only a hope for you, but I have
   a certainty concerning you! If you are brought to cry out, in all the
   senses I have mentioned, "Oh that I knew where I might find Him!" then,
   assuredly, the Lord has begun a good work in you and He will carry it
   on even unto the end.

   II. But now, for my second point, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO GIVE SOME REASONS
   WHY IT IS THAT A GRACIOUS GOD DELAYS AN ANSWER TO THE PRAYER OF
   PENITENT SINNERS. I think I hear someone asking,

   "How is it that God does not give a man comfort as soon as he repents?
   Why is it that the Lord makes some of His people wait in bondage when
   they are longing for liberty?"

   In the first place, it is to display His own Sovereignty. Ah, that is a
   word that is not often mentioned in pulpits! Divine Sovereignty is a
   very unfashionable Doctrine. Few people care to hear of a God who does
   as He pleases, who is absolute monarch over man, who knows of no law
   but His own will--which is always the will to do that which is right,
   to do good to those whom He has ordained unto eternal life--and to
   scatter mercy lavishly upon all His creatures. But we assert that there
   is such a thing as Divine Sovereignty and, more especially in the work
   of salvation! God seems to me to argue thus, "If I gave to all men
   peace as soon as they asked for it, they would begin to think they had
   a rightto it. Now, I will make some of them wait so that they may see
   that the mercy is absolutely in My hands and that if I chose to
   withhold it altogether, I might do so most justly. And so I will make
   men see that it is a gift of My Free Grace and not of their own merit."
   In some of our squares, where the owners are anxious to keep the right
   of way in their own hands, they sometimes shut the gates, not because
   they would inconvenience us, but because they would have the public see
   that, although they may let them through, yet they have no right of way
   and might be excluded if the proprietors please. So is it with God--He
   says, "Man, if I save you, it is entirely of My own will and pleasure.
   I give My Grace, not because you deserve it, for then it were not
   Grace, but I give it to the most undeserving of men that I may maintain
   My right to dispense it as I please." And I take it that this is the
   best way of proving God's Sovereignty, namely, His making a delay
   between penitence and faith, or between penitence and that faith which
   brings peace with God and joy in the Holy Spirit. I think that is one
   very important reason.

   But there is another. God sometimes delays manifesting His forgiving
   mercy to men in order that they may find out some secret sin. There is
   something hidden in their hearts of which they do not know. They come
   to God confessing their sins and they think they have make a clean
   breast of all their transgressions. "No," says God, "I will not give
   you pardon yet, or I will not, at present, apply it to your conscience.
   There is a secret sin you have not yet discovered." And He sets the
   heart to examine itself again--as Jerusalem is searched with
   candles--and, lo, there is some iniquity dragged out from the corner in
   which it was hidden! Conscience says, "I never knew of this sin. I
   never felt it to be a sin! Lord, I repent of it--will You not forgive
   me?" "Ah," says the mighty Maker, "now I have proved you, tried you and
   cast out this dross. I will now speak to you the word of consolation
   and comfort." Are you, then, a mourner seeking rest, and not finding
   it? I beseech you, look into your heart once more! Perhaps there is
   some hidden lust there, some secret sin. If so, turn the traitor out!
   Then will the Holy Spirit come and dwell in your soul and give you "the
   peace of God which passes all understanding."

   Another reason why God delays His mercy is that He may make us more
   useful in later life. A man is never made thoroughly useful until he
   has passed through suffering. I do not think there is much good done by
   a man who has never been afflicted. We must first prove in our own
   hearts and lives the Truths of God we are afterwards to preach, or we
   shall never preach them with effect! And if we are private Christians,
   we can never be of much use to our fellow men unless we have passed
   through trials similar to those which they have had to endure. So God
   makes some of His people wait a long time before He gives them the
   manifestation of their pardon, in order that, in later days, they may
   comfort others. The Lord is saying to many a tried soul, "I need you to
   be a consolation to others. Therefore I will make you full of grief and
   drunk with wormwood so that when you shall, in later years, meet with
   the mourner, you may say to him, 'I have suffered and endured the same
   trial that you are passing through.'" There are none so fit to comfort
   others as those who have once needed comfort themselves. Then take
   heart, poor afflicted one, perhaps the Lord designs you for a great
   work! He is keeping you low in bondage, doubt and fear, that He may
   bring you out more clearly and make your light like the light of seven
   days, and bring forth your righteousness "fair as the moor, clear as
   the sun and terrible as an army with banners." Wait, then, with
   patience, for God intends good to you and good to others through you,
   by this delay.

   But the delay often arises not so much from God, as from ourselves. It
   is ignorance of the way of salvation which keeps many a man longer in
   doubt than he would be if he knew more about it. I do not hesitate to
   affirm that one of the hardest things for a sinner to understand is the
   way of salvation. It seems the plainest thing in all the world--nothing
   appears more simple than, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved." But when the sinner is led to feel himself a sinner,
   he finds it not so easy to understand as he thought. We tell a man that
   with all their blackness, sinners may be pardoned. That with all their
   sins, they can be freely forgiven for Christ's sake. "But," says the
   man when he feels himself to be black, "do you mean to tell me that I
   am to be made whiter than snow? Do you really mean that I, who am lost,
   am to be saved, not through anything I do, or hope to do, but purely
   through what Another did ?" He can hardly believe it possible! He will
   have it that he must dosomething--he must do this, or that, or the
   other to help Christ--and the hardest thing in the world is to bring a
   man to see that salvation is of the Lord, alone, and not at all of
   himself! That it is God's free and perfect gift which leaves nothing of
   ours to be added to it, but is given to us to cover us completely, from
   head to foot, without anything of our own!

   Men will conceive what God would not have them imagine and they will
   not receive that which God would have them embrace! It may be very easy
   to talk of certain cures and to read of them. We may say,
   "Such-and-such a medicine is very effective and will work such-and-such
   a cure." But when we, ourselves, are sick, we are often very dubious
   about the medicine! And if, having taken draught after draught of it,
   we find that it does not help us, perhaps we are brought to think that
   though it may cure others, it cannot cure us, because there has been
   such delay in its operation. So the poor soul thinks of the Gospel,
   "Certainly it cannot heal me" And then he misunderstands the nature of
   the sacred medicine, altogether, and begins to take the Law instead of
   the Gospel. Now the Law never saved anyone yet, though it has condemned
   full many in its time--and will condemn us all unless we receive the
   Gospel.

   If any here should be in doubt on account of ignorance, let me, as
   plainly as I can, state the Gospel. I believe it to be wrapped up in
   one word--Substitution. I have always considered, with Luther and
   Calvin, that the sum and substance of the Gospel lies in that word,
   Substitution--Christ standing in the place of man. If I understand the
   Gospel, it is this--I deserve to be lost and ruined. The only reason
   why I should not be damned is that Christ was punished in my place and
   there is no need to execute a sentence twice for the same sin. On the
   other hand, I know that I cannot enter Heaven unless I have a perfect
   righteousness. I am absolutely certain I shall never have one of my
   own, for I find that I sin every day. But then Christ had a perfect
   righteousness and He said, "Here, take My garment, put it on--you shall
   stand before God as if you were Christ--and I will stand before God as
   if I had been you. I will suffer in your place and you shall be
   rewarded for works which you did not do, but which I did for you."

   I think the whole substance of salvation lies in the thought that
   Christ stood in the place of man. The prisoner is in the dock. He is
   about to be taken away to death. He deserves to die, for he has been a
   great criminal. But before he is removed, the Judge asks whether there
   is any possible plan whereby the prisoner's life can be spared. Up
   rises One who is, Himself, pure and perfect, has known no sin and, by
   the allowance of the Judge, for that is necessary, He steps into the
   dock and says, "Consider Me to be the prisoner. Pass the sentence on Me
   and let Me die. Reckon the prisoner to be Myself. I have fought for My
   country. I have deserved a reward for what I have done--reward him as
   if he had done good-and punish Me as if I had committed the sin."
   "But," you say, "Such a thing could not occur in an earthly court of
   law." No, but it has happened in God's Court of Law, in the great Court
   of King's Bench where God is the Judge of All, it has happened! The
   Savior said, "The sinner deserves to die. Let Me die in his place and
   let him be clothed in My righteousness."

   To illustrate this, I will give you two instances. One is that of an
   ancient King who enacted a law against a certain crime--the punishment
   of anyone who committed the crime was that he should have both his eyes
   put out. His own son committed the crime. The king, as a strict judge,
   said, "I cannot alter the law. I have said that the loss of two eyes
   shall be the penalty--take out one of mine and one of his." So, you
   see, he strictly carried out the law, but, at the same time, he was
   able to have mercy, in part, upon his son. But the case of Christ goes
   further than that. He did not say, "Exact half the penalty on Me and
   half on the sinner." He said, "Put both My eyes out; nail Me to the
   tree; let Me die; let Me take all the guilt away and then the sinner
   may go free." We have heard of another case, that of two brothers, one
   of whom had been a great criminal and was about to die, when his
   brother, coming into the court, decorated with medals and having many
   wounds upon him, rose up to plead with the judge that he would have
   mercy on the criminal for his sake. Then he began to strip himself and
   show his scars--how here and there on his big broad chest he had
   received saber cuts in defense of his country. "By these wounds," he
   said, and he lifted up one arm, the other having been cut away, "by
   these, my wounds, and the sufferings I have endured for my country, I
   beseech you, have mercy on him." For his brother's sake, the criminal
   was allowed to escape the punishment that was hanging over his head. It
   was even so with Christ. "The sinner," He said, "deserves to die. Then
   I will die in his place. He deserves not to enter Heaven, for he has
   not kept the Law of God, but I have kept the Law for him--he shall have
   My righteousness and I will take his sin--and so the Just shall die for
   the unjust, to bring him to God."

   III. I have thus turned aside from the subject, somewhat, in order to
   clear away any ignorance that might exist in the minds of certain of my
   hearers as to this essential point of the Gospel plan. And now I am, in
   closing my discourse, to give SOME ADVICE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
   SEEKING CHRIST, BUT WHO HAVE NEVER FOUND HIM,

   AS TO HOW THEY MIGHT FIND HIM.

   In the first place, let me say, Go wherever Christ goes. If Christ were
   to walk this earth again and heal the sick, as He did when He was here,
   before, many sick people would enquire, "Where will Christ be
   tomorrow?" And, as soon as they found out where He would take His
   walks, there they would be, lying on the pavement, in the hope that as
   He passed by, He would heal them. Go up, then, sick Soul, to Christ's
   House! It is there that He meets with His people. Read His Word! It is
   there that He blesses them by applying sweet promises to them. Observe
   His ordinances. Do not neglect them. Christ comes to Bethesda Pool, so
   lie by the water and wait till He arrives. If you cannot put in your
   foot, be where Christ comes. Thomas did not get the blessing, for He
   was not with the other disciples when the Master came to them. Stay not
   away from the House of God, poor seeking Soul--be there whenever the
   doors are opened, so that, when Jesus passes by, He may look on you and
   say, "Your sins are forgiven you."

   And whatever else you do, when Christ passes by, cry after Him with all
   your might! Never be satisfied until you make Him stop. And if He
   should frown on you, seemingly for the moment, do not be silenced or
   stayed. If you are a little stirred by a sermon, pray over it--do not
   lose the auspicious moment. If you hear anything read which gives you
   some hope, lift up your heart in prayer at once! When the wind blows,
   then should the sails be set, and it may happen that God will give you
   Grace to reach the harbor's mouth and you may find the haven of
   perpetual rest. There was a man who was born blind and who longed to
   have his sight. As he sat by the roadway, one day, he was told that
   Jesus was passing by. And when he heard that, he cried after Him,
   "Jesus, You Son of David, have mercy on me!" The people wanted to hear
   Christ preach, so they tried to hush the poor man, but he cried again,
   "You Son of David, have mercy on me!" The Son of David turned not His
   head. He did not look upon the man, but continued His discourse. But
   still the man shouted, "Jesus, You Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   And then Jesus stopped. The disciples ran to the poor man and said, "Be
   still, trouble not the Master." But he cried so much the more, "Jesus,
   You Son of David, have mercy on me!" And Jesus at last asked him, "What
   will you that I should do unto you?" He answered, "Lord, that I might
   receive my sight." He received it "and followed Jesus in the way."
   Perhaps your doubts say to you, "Hush! Do not pray any more." Or Satan
   says, "Be still! Do not cry to Christ any more." Tell your doubts and
   fears, and the devil, too, that you will give Christ no rest till He
   turns His eyes upon you in love and heals your diseases. Cry aloud to
   Him, O you awakened Sinner, when He is passing by!

   The next piece of advice I would give you is this--think very much of
   Christ. No way that I know of will bring you faith in Christ as well as
   thinking of Him. I would advise you, conscience-stricken Sinner, to
   spend an hour in meditation on Christ. You do not need to devote that
   time to meditation on yourself--you will get very little good from
   that--you may know beforehand that there is no hope for you in
   yourself. But spend an hour in meditation on Christ. Go, Beloved, to
   your most private place of seclusion. Sit down and picture Christ in
   the garden--think you see Him there, sweating, as it were, great drops
   of blood falling down to the ground. Then view Him standing in Pilate's
   Hall. Behold Him with His hands bound, His back streaming with blood!
   Then follow Him till you see Him coming to the hill called Calvary.
   Think you see Him hurled backwards and nailed to the Cross. Then let
   your imagination, or rather your faith, bring before you the Cross
   lifted up and dashed into its socket, when every bone of Christ was
   jerked out of joint. Look at Him. Look at His crown of thorns and watch
   the beaded drops of blood trickling down His cheeks--

   "See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled
   down!

   Did ever such love and sorrow meet,

   Or thorns compose so rich a crown!

   His dying crimson, like a robe,

   Spreads over His body on the tree,

   Then am I dead to all the globe,

   And all the globe is dead to me." I know of no means, under God, so
   profitable for producing faith as thinking of Christ, for while you are
   looking at Him, you will say, "Blessed Jesus, did You die for sinners?
   Then, surely, my Soul, His death is sufficient for you." He is able to
   save unto the uttermost all those who trust in Him. You may think of a
   doctrine forever and get no good from it, if you are not already saved.
   But think of the Person of Christ and specially of His death, for that
   will bring you faith. Think of Him everywhere, wherever you go. Try to
   meditate on Him in all your leisure moments and then He will reveal
   Himself to you and give you peace.

   None of us, not even the best of Christians, think and say enough of
   Christ. I went into a friend's house, one day, and he said to me, as a
   sort of hint, I suppose, "I have known So-and-So these 30 years,
   without hearing anything of his religion." I said, "You will not know
   me 30 minutes without hearing something of mine." It is a fact that
   many Christian people spend their Sunday afternoons in talking about
   other subjects and Jesus Christ is scarcely ever mentioned. As for poor
   ungodly worldlings, of course they neither say nor think anything of
   Him. But oh, you that know yourself to be a sinner, despise not the Man
   of Sorrows! Let His bleeding hands rest on you! Look at His pierced
   side and, looking, you shall live! Remember, it is only by looking to
   Christ that we shall be saved, not by doing anythingourselves.

   This brings me to close by saying to every awakened sinner--If you
   would have peace with God, and have it now, venture on Christ. We must
   venture on Christ, and venture wholly, or else we can never be saved.
   Yet it is hardly right to say venture, for it is no venture--there is
   not a grain of chance in it. He that trusts Himself to Christ need
   never fear. "But," someone asks, "how am I to trust Christ? What do you
   mean by trusting in Christ??" Why, I mean just what I say--fully trust
   on what Christ did for the salvation of sinners. A Negro slave, when he
   was asked how he believed, said, "Massa, dis is how I believe--I fall
   flat down on de promise, I can't fall no lower." He had just the right
   idea about believing in Jesus. Believing is falling down on Christ and
   looking to Him to hold you up. I will illustrate it by an anecdote
   which I have often told. A boy at sea who was very fond of mounting to
   the masthead, one day climbed to the maintop, and could not get down.
   The sea was very rough and it was seen that, in a little while, the boy
   would fall on the deck and be dashed to pieces. His father saw but one
   way of saving his life. Seizing a speaking-trumpet, he shouted, "Boy,
   the next time the ship lurches, drop into the sea." The next time the
   ship lurched, the boy looked down and, not at all liking the idea of
   throwing himself into the sea, still clung to the mast. The father, who
   saw that the boy's strength would soon fail him, took a gun in his hand
   and cried out, "Boy, if you don't drop into the sea the next time the
   ship lurches, I'll shoot you!"

   The boy knew his father meant it--and the next time the ship lurched,
   he leaped into the sea. It seemed liked certain destruction, but out
   went a dozen brawny arms and he was saved. The sinner, in the midst of
   the storm, thinks he must cling to the mast of his good works, and so
   be saved. Says the Gospel, "Let go your own works, and drop into the
   ocean of God's Grace." "No," says the sinner, "it is a long way between
   me and God's Grace. I will perish if I trust to that. I must have some
   other reliance." "If you have any other reliance than that, you are
   lost." Up comes the thundering Law of God and declares to the sinner
   that unless he gives up every dependence, he will be lost. Then follows
   the happy moment when the sinner says, "Dear Lord, I give up all my
   dependence, and cast myself on You. I take You, Jesus, to be my one
   objective in life, My only trust, the refuge of my soul."

   Can any of you say that in your hearts? I know there are some of you
   who can, but are there any who could not say it when they came here,
   but who can say it now? Oh, I would rejoice if one such were brought to
   God! I am conscious that I have not preached to you as I desired, but
   if one such has been brought to believe and trust in the Savior, I
   rejoice, for thereby God will be glorified!

   But, alas, for such of you as will go away and say, "The man has talked
   about salvation, but what does it matter to us?" You think you can
   afford to laugh at God and His Gospel today, but remember, men cannot
   afford to despise boats when their vessel is going down in a storm,
   although they may do so on land. Death is after you and will soon seize
   you--your pulse must soon cease to beat. Strong as you are, now, your
   bones are not made of brass, nor are your ribs of steel. Sooner or
   later you must lie on your lowly pallet and there breathe out your
   last. Or, if you are ever so rich, you must die on your curtained beds
   and must depart from all your enjoyment into everlasting punishment!
   You will find it hard work to laugh at Christ, then! You will find it
   dreadful work to scoff at religion, then, in that day when Death gets
   hold of you, and asks, "Will you laugh now, Scoffer?" "Ah," you will
   say, "I find it different from what I supposed. I cannot laugh now
   death is near me."

   Take warning, then, before death comes! Take warning! He must be a poor
   ignorant man who does not insure his house before it is on fire and he
   must be the greatest of fools who thinks it unnecessary to seek the
   salvation of his soul till he comes to the last moment and is in peril
   of his life! May God give you thought and consideration, so that you
   may be led to flee from sin and fly to Jesus! And may God, the
   Everlasting Father, give you what I cannot--His Grace, which saves the
   soul and makes sinners into saints and lands them in Heaven!

   I can only close by repeating the Words of the Gospel, "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall
   be damned." Having said this, if I had said no more, I would have
   preached Christ's Gospel to you. The Lord give you understanding in all
   things and help you to believe, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

Christ's Care of His Disciples

   (No. 2616)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 2, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING, EARLY IN
   THE YEAR 1857.

   "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go their way." John 18:8.

   WE need but hint at the circumstances under which these words were
   uttered. Our Savior was in the Garden of Geth-semane with His disciples
   when a multitude came with the officers commissioned by the High Priest
   to seize Him. He went boldly towards them and asked, "Whom do you
   seek?" They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth." At His words, "I am He,"
   "they drew back and fell to the ground," and then Jesus said to them,
   "I have told you that I am He. If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go
   their way."

   Now, in a very simple manner, I shall try, first of all, to draw a few
   lessons from this occurrence and then, secondly, to bring out a great
   Truth of God which I think is foreshadowed in this utterance of our
   Redeemer.

   I. First, let us CONSIDER THE LESSONS OF THE OCCURRENCE ITSELF. Our
   Savior said to these people, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go
   their way."

   In this incident, our Master proved His own willingness to die. This
   word of His was a mandate so powerful that none of the disciples were
   seized, much less put to death. There was Peter, who had drawn his
   sword and cut off the ear of the High Priest's servant. We should
   naturally have expected that he would have been arrested, or smitten to
   the earth, but so powerful was the command of Christ that not a finger
   was laid upon His hasty-tempered disciple. Peter and John later went
   into the judgment hall--into the very teeth of our Lord's enemies--but,
   with the exception of a few jeers, they were allowed to go their way.
   John did even more than that, for he went within the range of the
   spears of the Roman soldiers and stood at the foot of Christ's Cross
   and wept--yet not a finger was laid on him, nor on any of Christ's
   disciples--not for lack of will, for, you remember, they seized a young
   man who left his garment in their hands, and fled naked--evidently
   supposing him to have been a disciple of Christ. This shows, then, the
   power of Christ's mandate that, in that hour of darkness, not so much
   as one of His disciples was maltreated, but all were allowed to go
   their way. If Christ, then, by His simple word, delivered His
   disciples, how much more could He have delivered Himself? And in His
   not doing so, you cannot fail to see how willing He was to die. One
   word threw them to the ground. Another word would have hurled them into
   the arms of death! But our Savior would not speak the word which might
   have saved Himself, for He came to save others, not Himself.

   There is something very courageous in the Savior's saying, "If you seek
   Me." You know that when Adam sinned, God had to seek the culprit, but,
   in this case, when Christ stood as the Surety for His people, instead
   of being sought, He seemed to seek His executioners! "If you seek Me,"
   He said--and He put in an, "if," as though it were not so much their
   seeking Him as His seeking them--for He had come into their very midst
   to die. Our blessed Lord was well acquainted with the circumstances of
   His own death. He sat at the table, at the institution of the Lord's
   Supper on that memorable evening--why could He not wait and be seized
   there? But no, dauntless, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah" steps out
   and boldly faces His enemy! He does not wait to be attacked, but goes
   forth to meet death, to give Himself up for us. Scarcely any martyr has
   done such a deed as this! God has helped them to die when they have
   been delivered into the hands of their enemies, but our Savior goes to
   His enemies and says, "Here I am. If you seek Me, I have come to give
   Myself up. I will put you to no trouble in searching for Me. There is
   no necessity to hunt through the length and breadth of Jerusalem to
   find Me. Here I am. If you seek Me, I am ready to die. Take Me, I have
   no opposition to make. 'If you seek Me,' all I have to say is, 'Let
   these go their way.' As for Myself, I am willing enough to die!"

   Learn, then, Christian, the readiness of your Master to suffer for you.
   He was no unwilling Savior. You have, sometimes, borrowed money from a
   friend and when you have taken it from him, it was a grief to you to
   accept it, for he looked upon you as a beggar, or even as a robber who
   had demanded spoil of him. But when you take Christ's favors, there is
   this sweet consideration with them, that they are all given willingly!
   The blood that you drink and the flesh that you eat, spiritually, is no
   dole of a strained benevolence, but the voluntary, munificent gift from
   the heart of Jesus to you and to your brethren. Rejoice, then, in the
   willingness of Christ to suffer for you!

   In the second place, upon the very face of our text we read the care of
   Christ towards His people. "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go
   their way." Oh, the agony of the Savior's heart at that moment! A
   friend in trouble is frequently forgetful--expect not a man in great
   grief to remember you--the heart is then so full of its own bitterness
   it has no time to think of others. I would pardon any man for not
   noticing me in the street if he were ill. I would easily forgive anyone
   for forgetting anything when loaded with pain and sorrow and surely,
   Beloved, we might have thought it not hard of Jesus if He had forgotten
   His disciples in His hour of grief! But mark how kind His heart
   is--"'If you seek Me'--I say nothing about how you should treat Me--but
   'let these'--these disciples were the only ones He cared about. He
   cared not for Himself--'let these go their way.'"

   Like the mother in the snowstorm who takes off her own clothes to wrap
   around her cold shivering baby--what does she care though the cold
   blast should find out her inmost soul, and though her body is frozen
   like ice, if her baby but lives? Her first thought, after she is
   restored to consciousness, when she has been well-nigh benumbed to
   death, but chafed to life by kindness, is concerning that baby! It was
   even so with Jesus. "Let these go their way."--

   "When Justice, by our sins provoked,

   Drew forth its dreadful sword,

   He gave His soul up to the stroke

   Without a murmuring word.

   This was compassion like a God,

   That when the Savor knew

   The price of pardon was His blood,

   His pity ne'er withdrew.

   Now though He reigns exalted high,

   His love is still as great.

   Well He remembers Calvary,

   Nor lets His saints forget."

   They are all remembered, all borne upon His heart and still cared for.
   Therefore you are cared for, you lamb of the flock! You are cared for,
   poor Ready-to-Halt! You are remembered, Miss Despondency! You are
   regarded with the eyes of love, timid Mr. Fearing! Though you stumble
   at every stone, yet your Savior's love fails not! He remembers you, for
   He cared for His disciples in His hour of greatest sorrow.

   In the next place, learn from this incident our Savior's wisdom. When
   He said, "Let these go their way," there was wisdom in it. How? Because
   they were not prepared to suffer and it would have been unwise to have
   allowed them to suffer, then, even if they had been prepared--for if
   they had suffered, then, it would have been thought that at least they
   shared the honor of our redemption--therefore Christ would have none
   but thieves upon the mount of doom, lest any should suppose that He had
   a helper! He tread the winepress alone and of the people there were
   none with Him. Besides, these disciples were but infants in Divine
   Grace--they had not received the plenitude of the Spirit. They were not
   fit to suffer. Therefore Christ said, "If you seek Me, let these go
   their way." These raw recruits must not yet bear the brunt of the
   battle. Let them tarry until, by a greater experience and by greater
   Grace, they shall be made brave to die and shall, each of them in his
   turn, wear the crown of martyrdom. But not now. Christ spared His
   people at that moment since it would have been unwise to have allowed
   them to die then.

   Learn also, Christians, from your Master's example, the duty of putting
   yourselves in the way of suffering when you can save your Brothers and
   Sisters. Oh, there is something glorious in the spirit Christ
   manifested in placing Himself first. "If you seek Me, let these go
   their way." That is the spirit all Christians ought to have--the spirit
   of heroic selfsacrifice for the disciples' sake. The mere professor
   says, "Let me go my way, seek another to be put to death." But if we
   were what we should be, we would, each one, say, "If you seek me, let
   these go their way." How many of us would be ready to escape martyrdom
   and allow our Brethren to be burned! That would not be the spirit of
   our Master. How frequently you are ready to allow ridicule and shame to
   fall upon the Church if you can but be spared! How very frequently you
   will allow a Brother to perform a duty, at much inconvenience, which
   you could do without any trouble to yourself! Now, if you were like
   your Master, you would say, "'Let these go their way.' If there is
   sufficient ground for it, let me suffer. If there is a painful duty,
   let me do it. Let others escape, let them go free--lo, I will be,
   myself, a willing substitute for them in this matter." Oh, we need,
   everywhere, more of this spirit to be able to say to the poor saint,
   "Poverty is seeking you. I will, in some degree, bear the inconvenience
   that you may be spared. You are sick. I will watch you. You are in
   need. I will clothe you. You are hungry. I will feed you. I will stand
   in your place as far as I am able, that you may go your way."

   These seem to me to be the lessons to be learned from our Savior's
   words, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go their way."

   II. Now I come to notice, secondly, THE GREAT DOCTRINE WHICH THIS
   INCIDENT SEEMS TO FORESHADOW.

   Will you please observe the next verse to the text? "That the saying
   might be fulfilled, which He spoke, 'Of them which You gave Me have I
   lost none.'" If I had quoted this passage in such a connection, you
   would have told me it was a misquotation. You would have said, "Why, my
   dear Sir, that has nothing to do with the disciples going their way or
   not!" Ah, but you would be quite in error if you talked like that!
   God's Spirit knows how to quote, if we do not. Very often we refer our
   hearers to a text which we think is exactly adapted and pertinent to
   the point before us when it has really nothing to do with the matter.
   And, often, the Holy Spirit quotes a text which we think unsuitable,
   but, on closer examination, we find that the very gist of it bears
   directly upon the subject. This was the beginning of Christ's
   deliverances which He would, through eternity, vouchsafe to all His
   children. Inasmuch as He then said, "Let these go their way," it was
   the foreshadowing, the picturing of the greet deed of Substitution
   whereby Christ would be able to say, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let
   these go their way." This point will appear dearly if we look at how
   Christ treats His people in Providence and at the bar of Justice.

   It has always seemed to me as if Christ had borne the brunt of
   Providence for His peopleso that now all things work together for their
   good! When Christ came into the world, He did, in spirit, say something
   like this, "You wild beasts of the field, you are against My
   people--come, now, be against Me and, then, let these go their way."
   This was according to the ancient prophecy--"I will make a covenant for
   them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of Heaven, and
   with the creeping things of the ground." Christ seemed to say, "Stones,
   you are enemies to My flock--take Me for their Substitute and be at
   enmity against Me. And then it shall be written, 'The stones of the
   field shall be in league with them.'" Christ, as it were, said to
   Providence, "Your black and bitter face shall look on Me. Your quiver,
   full of fiery darts, shall be emptied, and they shall all find their
   target here in My bosom. Your dread aspect shall be seen by Me, but,
   'Let these go their way.'"

   Providence has indicted its evils on Christ and has now only good for
   God's people! "What? Only good, Sir?" you say, "why, I am poor, I am
   sick!" Yes, but it is only good, for that is good which works good.
   "All things work together for good to them that love God." Christ even
   says to kings, "Touch not My anointed and do My prophets no harm." "Let
   these go their way." The kings of the earth have been seeking Christ's
   Church, to destroy and to devour it, so Christ lets them find Him and
   put Him to death! And before He dies, He turns round to the kings, and
   says, "Touch not My anointed and do My prophets no harm." He speaks to
   trouble, to trial, to grief, to accident and to peril as He says, "You
   have sought Me, now let My people go their way." We would never have
   known the sweetness of the Psalm--

   "He that has made his refuge God, Shall find a most secure abode"-- if
   Christ had not died! The only way that you and I can have a refuge is
   by Christ bearing the brunt of our trouble. How does a shield save me?
   It saves me by bearing the blows, itself. The shield does, as it were,
   say to the swords of the enemy, "If you seek me, let this warrior go
   his way." So Christ, our Shield and God's Anointed, bears the brunt of
   Providence, the evil and the woe, thereof, and He now says to the
   mysterious dispensations of God concerning all the children of the
   Lord, "'Let these go their way.' Never, never work ill to them, but let
   them have only good."

   The other thought is, Christ has said this ofHispeople even to Justice.
   Before the Throne of God, fiery Justice once drew his sword and went
   out after sinners, to find many and to cast them into the Pit. His
   sword thirsted for the blood of all that had sinned. But there stood a
   chosen multitude, reserved by love and chosen by Grace, and Justice
   said, "They are sinners. I will have them, I will sheathe this sword in
   their hearts, for they are sinners and they must perish." Then Christ
   came forward and asked him, "Whom do you seek?" "Sinners," answered
   Justice. Then Jesus said, "They are not sinners. They were sinners,
   once, but they are now righteous, clothed in My righteousness. If you
   seek the sinner, here am I." "What?" said Justice, "are You the
   sinner?" "No, not the sinner, but I am the sinner's Substitute. All the
   sinner's guilt was imputed to Me. All his unrighteousness is Mine and
   all My righteousness is his. I, the Savior, am the sinner's Substitute.
   Take Me." And Justice accepted the substitution, took the Savior,
   crucified Him, nailed Him to that Cross whose agonies we commemorate at
   the Communion Table. In that hour Jesus cried, "If you seek Me, let
   these go their way." Who are they that are to go their way? Why, the
   very men whose former way was one of iniquity and whose end would have
   been destruction if the curse had not been made to fall upon the head
   of Jesus!

   "Let these go their way." Oh, that a wonderful sentence! I never knew
   its sweetness till I found the Lord, but I did know something of its
   power. Do you ask, "How was that?" Why, long before you know the Lord,
   you have some of the power of the blood of Christ resting upon you.
   "How so?" do you ask? Why, do you not know it to be a fact that--

   "Determined to save, He watched o'er our path, When Satan's blind
   slaves, we sported with death"? And so, some of the benefits of
   Christ's death were ours before we knew Him and before we loved Him!
   The reason why I was not damned before I knew the Savior was that He
   had said, "Let him go his way. I have died for him." You would have
   been in Hell these 20 years, Saint, for you were then unregenerate. But
   Christ said, "Let him go his way. If you seek Me, he shall go his way,
   sinner though he is." And now, when gloomy fears arise, and dark
   thoughts roll over our mind, let this be our comfort! We are still
   sinners--guilty and vile--but the same voice says, "Let these go their
   way." It is the "let" of command--and who can hinder when God lets in
   this sense? "Let these go their way." You are going up Bun-yan's Hill
   Difficulty and there are lions at the top. Christians remember this
   message, "Let these go their way." You will, perhaps, get into Giant
   Despair's dungeon. Here is a key that will fit the lock--"Let these go
   their way." You will be tumbling about in the Slough of Despond--here
   is a stone to put your foot on to help you to get out--"Let these go
   their way." Why? Because they pray? No. Because they serve God? No--the
   mandate was given before they did either the one or the other. "Let
   these go their way" because Christ died in their place!

   The day is coming, and shall soon be here, when you and I shall stretch
   our wings and fly away to the land that is very far off. I think I
   might picture in my imagination the soul when it has left the body. The
   Believer speeds his way up to his native city, Jerusalem, "the mother
   of us all." But at the gate one stands and he says, "Have you a right
   to admission here? It is written, 'He that walks righteously, and
   speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes
   his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of
   blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high.'
   Are you such an one?" "Ah," says the soul, "I hope by Grace I have been
   made so; but I cannot claim to have always been so, for 'I the chief of
   sinners am.'" "Then how came you here? This gate gives no admission to
   those who are sinners." While the angel is thus parleying, I hear a
   Voice crying, "Let these go their way" and, forthwith, the gates of
   Heaven are opened and every soul for whom Christ died enters into
   Paradise!

   Come, Saint, close up this simple meditation by looking yonder. See
   Christ, with Justice, Vengeance, Wrath, all seeking Him. Lo, they have
   found Him! They have slain Him! He is buried! He has risen again! Oh,
   see them seeking Him and, as you sit down at His Table, think, "When
   they sought Him, they let me go my way." And what a sweet way it is! I
   am allowed to come to His Table of Communion. Why? Because they sought
   Him. I am invited to hold fellowship with Jesus. Why? Because they
   sought Him. I am permitted to have a good hope through Divine Grace
   and, more than that, "I know that when this earthly house of my
   tabernacle is dissolved, I have a building of God, a house not made
   with hands, eternal in the heavens."

   Why am I to go that way? Why? Because they sought Himand found Him!
   Otherwise, where had I been now? My place might have been on the
   alehouse bench, or, perhaps, in the seat of the scorner. And what would
   have been my prospect? Why, that, at the last, I would be in Hell among
   the fiends and the lost spirits of the Pit! But now I tread the paths
   of righteousness and the ways of Grace. Oh, let me remember why I do
   so--it is because they sought You, O precious Lord of mine! They sought
   You, my dear Redeemer and my God! They sought Your heart and broke it!
   They sought Your head and crowned it with thorns! They sought Your
   hands and nailed them to the tree! They sought Your feet and pierced
   them! They sought Your body, they slew and buried it! And now, though
   the roaring lion may seek me ever so much, he cannot devour me! Never
   can I be torn in pieces, never can I be destroyed, for I carry with me
   this sweet passport of the King of Heaven, "Let these go their way."

   O child of God, take this with you for your safe conduct everywhere!
   When men travel abroad, they carry with them a permit to go to this
   town and the other. Take this little sentence, Brother or Sister in
   Jesus, and when Unbelief stops you, draw it out, and say, "He has said,
   'Let these go their way.'" And when Satan stops you, hold out to him
   this Divine Mandate, "Let these go their way." And when Death shall
   stop you, take out this sweet permit from your Master, "Let these go
   their way." And when the Throne of Judgment shall be set and you stand
   before it, plead this sentence, plead it even before Your Maker, "My
   Master said, 'Let these go their way.'"

   Oh, cheering words! I could weep them all out, but I will say no more.
   I hope many of you will enjoy the sweetness of them while we gather
   around the Lord's Table, in obedience to His gracious command, "This do
   in remembrance of Me."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 17; 18:1-9.

   John 17:1. These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to Heaven,
   and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son may
   also glorify You. Jesus is going forth to die and He knows it, yet He
   prays to His Father, "Glorify Your Son." There was no way of His coming
   to that Glory except by passing through tears, blood, agony and death.
   He only asks that He may be glorified in what He is about to do and
   suffer--and He is ready for it all--"Father, the hour is come; glorify
   Your Son, that Your Son may also glorify You."

   2. As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give
   eternal life to as many as You have given Him. In that saying of our
   Lord's we have an explanation of what He did by His redemption. There
   was a universal aspect of it-- "You have given Him power over all
   flesh." There was a special design in it--"That He should give eternal
   life to as many as You have given Him." Sometimes, two views of the
   same thing may appear to contradict each other, but when we are taught
   of God, we soon discover that they do not really do so, and that a
   grand Truth may be contained in the two descriptions of it. Christ had,
   by virtue of His death, power over all flesh, but it was for a distinct
   purpose--"that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given
   Him."

   3. And this is eternallife, that theymight know You, the only true God,
   andJesus Christ, whom You have sent By this, then, dear Friends, we can
   know whether we have eternal life or not. Do we know the Father? Do we
   know Jesus Christ as the Messiah, the Sent One? Are we resting in that
   blessed knowledge? If so, He has given us eternal life.

   4. 5. I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which
   You gave Me to do, And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself
   with the Glory which I had with You before the world was. In deep
   humility, Jesus had laid that Glory aside for a while. He had
   tabernacled in human flesh--and when He spoke these words, the time was
   approaching when--

   "AllHis world and warfare done,"

   He would go back to His pristine Glory with something more added to it.

   6. I have manifested Your name unto the men which You gave Me out of
   the world. They had not, all of them, clearly seen that manifestation.
   Jesus had to ask the question, "Have I been so long with you, and yet
   have you not known Me, Philip?" Still, that was not the fault of the
   manifestation. Christ had manifested the name--that is, the Character--
   of God unto those who had been given to Him out of the world.

   6. Yours they were and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your
   Word. We might have expected that the verse would end, "and I have kept
   them." But their keeping God's Word is the evidence that Christ has
   kept them! Whenever a soul loves the Word of God, delights in the
   teaching of Christ, glories in those things which the world calls
   dogmas--as if they were so much dog's meat--when you and I can feed
   upon these things--when every utterance of Christ is dear and precious
   to us--that is good evidence of our being called out of the world and
   separated unto Christ! It is one of the marks of Divine Grace which
   Jesus works in those whom the Father has given Him. "Yours they were
   and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your Word."

   7. Now they have known that all things whatever You have given Me are
   of You. The Father gives Christ the Truth which Christ gives to us. The
   Father gives Christ the souls which Jesus keeps until the day of His
   power. There is mutual communion between God the Father and His blessed
   Son--let us never say a word that might look as if we did not
   understand the Oneness, the everlasting and Infinite Oneness--which
   there is between the sacred Persons of the Divine Unity.

   8. For I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me. You know how
   men talk against "verbal Inspiration." Yet Christ says, "I have given
   unto them the Words which You gave Me." Many are trifling with the
   teaching of God's Word as if it were of no importance at all. Not so
   Christ! "I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me."

   8. And they have received them, and have known surely that I came out
   from You, and they have believed that You did send Me. Firmly do we
   believe this and in our heart of hearts we accept every part of the
   teaching of Christ, no matter what it is. I hear people say, sometimes,
   "Oh, but that is not essential!" There is a great deal of mischief
   hatched out of that egg! O Friends, it is essential that Christ's
   disciples should treasure whatever He has said! Never trifle with that
   part of the Word of God which seems to be less essential to salvation
   than another portion, for if it is not essential to salvation, it may
   be essential to your comfort, or your holiness, or your strength, or
   your usefulness. And if it be essential to God's Glory, let us never
   trample it in the mire, or in any way dishonor it. Who am I that I
   should say, "This which God has spoken is important, but that other is
   not"? It does not do for us to presume to judge the Word of God--we
   should rather let the Word of God judge us.

   9. I pray for them.--Blessed Words! Christ prays for His own people. "I
   pray for them." I pray not for the world, but for them which You have
   given Me. In that last hour, just before His Passion, His thoughts were
   separating the precious from the vile and His prayer ascended for His
   own people. "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them
   which You have given Me."

   9, 10. For they are Yours. And all Mine are Yours and Yours are Mine;
   and Iam glorified in them. It is a wonderful thing that Christ should
   be glorified in His people! Can it be that He shall be glorified in me?
   Dear child of God, you sometimes sit in the corner and think to
   yourself, "How insignificant I am! The Church on earth would not miss
   me if I were taken away. And the choirs of Heaven cannot need me." Oh,
   but your Lord is glorified in You! If you are one of His chosen and
   redeemed people, in your very weakness and need He finds opportunity to
   glorify His strength and His fullness! He knows the truth about this
   matter and He says, "I am glorified in them."

   11. And now I am no more in the world. He was going away. He has now
   gone.

   11. But these are in the world. We know we are, do we not, Brothers and
   Sisters? We have a thousand things, some of them very painful and
   humiliating, to remind us that we are still in the world.

   11. And I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your own name those
   whom You have given Me, that they may be one, as We are. Oh, what
   blessed keeping is that--to be kept in spiritual oneness! I do not
   expect to see the people of God in visible oneness, but as there was a
   secret, invisible Union, most real and most true, between the Father
   and the Son, so there is, at this time, a secret union in the hearts of
   all Believers, most deep, most real, most true! I may never have seen
   that good friend before, but as soon as we begin to talk of Jesus and
   His love, if we are the living children of the living God, the bond of
   unity is felt at once by both of us! "One is your Master, even Christ;
   and all you are brethren."

   12. While I was with them in the world, Ikept them in Your name: those
   that You gave Me Ihave kept, andnone of them is lost, but the son of
   perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. What a blessed
   Shepherd is this who never lost a sheep! Judas crept in among the
   flock, but he was never truly one of the flock. He was never a son of
   God. He was "the son of perdition" all along. Christ has kept all His
   sheep and all His lambs--and He will do the same, dear Friends, even to
   the end.

   13. And now come I to You and these things I speak in the world, that
   they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves. What an unselfish
   Savior! His heart is ready to break with His impending sufferings and
   yet He prays for us, that we may be filled with His joy! I suppose that
   it is true that the Man of Sorrows was the happiest man who ever lived.
   "For the joy that was set before Him, He endured the Cross, despising
   the shame." And, notwithstanding His boundless and bottomless grief,
   there was within Him such communion with God, love to men and the
   certainty of His ultimate triumph that kept Him still joyous above the
   seas of tribulation! He prays that that same joy may be fulfilled in
   us. May God graciously grant it to all of us who believe in Jesus!

   14, 15. Ihave given them Your Word; and the world has hated them,
   because they are not of the world, even as Iam not of the world. I pray
   not that You should take them out of the world, but that You should
   keep them from the Evil One. There is a reason for God's elect being
   allowed to remain in the world. They are never left like wheat in the
   field, to perish through the damp and cold, or to be devoured by the
   birds of the air. Oh, no! We are left for God's Glory, that men may see
   what the Grace of God can do in poor frail bodies. We are left for the
   service of Christ's Church, that we may be here for a while to carry on
   the cause of God, to be the means of comforting the little ones and to
   seek the conversion of sinners. We are to be like salt to prevent
   putrefaction. We are God's preventive men, to prevent as much of the
   evil as we can--and we are to fight with the evil that cannot be
   prevented and to seek to overthrow it in Christ's name.

   16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Many,
   nowadays, say that we ought to blend the Church with the congregation
   and that it is a great pity to have any division between them. A great
   many good people are outside the Church--therefore try to make the
   Church as much like the world as you can! That is a silly trick of the
   devil which the wise servants of God will answer by saying, "To whom we
   give place for subjection? No, not for an hour!" There must always be a
   broad line of demarcation between the Church of Christ and the
   world--it will be an evil day when that line is abolished. The sons of
   God took to themselves wives of the daughters of men, but that kind of
   union brought mischief with it, and it will always do so.

   17. Sanctify them through Your Truth: Your Word is Truth. We cannot
   afford to give up God's Inspired Word because it is a means of our
   sanctification. If this is taken away, it is not such-and-such a dogma,
   as they call it, put into the background, but it is the Truth of God
   that would sanctify us which is discarded, it is God's own Word that is
   flung to the dogs! And that must never be.

   18. 19. As You have sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent
   them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they,
   also, might be sanctified through the Truth. "I set Myself apart unto
   holiness, that they, also, might be set apart unto holy uses through
   the Truth."

   20. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them, also, which shall
   believe on Me through their word. Our Lord knew that the little circle
   around Him would grow into a multitude that no man can number, out of
   all nations, kindreds, people and tongues--so He prayed for all whom
   His Father had given Him.

   21, 22. That they all may be one as You, Father, are in Me, and I in
   You, that they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that
   You have sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me Ihave given them;
   that they may be one, even as We are One. The Church will never know
   her true Glory till she knows her perfect oneness--the One Church will
   be the glorious Church!

   23. Iin them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
   that the worldmay know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as
   You have loved Me. That is a grand expression--"You have loved them, as
   You have loved Me." What? With the same love? It is even so--a love
   without beginning, a love without change, a love without bounds, a love
   without end! "You have loved them as You have loved Me."

   24-26. Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with
   Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory, which You have given me:
   for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous
   Father, the world has not known You: but Ihave known You, and these
   have known that You have sent Me. And I have declared unto them Your
   name, and will declare it: that the love in which You have loved Me may
   be in them, and I in them. This blessed prayer was heard by the Father.
   All of it must be fulfilled--and untold blessings do and shall come to
   us through this intercession of our Lord. Blessed be His holy name!

   John 18:1. When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His
   disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which He
   entered, and His disciples. Our Lord could not cross that "brook
   Kidron" without being reminded of the time when David went that way in
   the hour of his sorrow, though He knew that He had to face a far
   greater trial than that of David. The very brook would remind Him of
   His approaching Sacrifice, for through it flowed the blood and refuse
   from the Temple.

   2. And Judas, also, which betrayed Him, knew the place: for Jesus often
   resorted there with His disciples. The place of our Lord's frequent
   retirement for private prayer was well known to Judas, who had often
   gone there with his Lord and his fellow disciples.

   3. Judas, then, having received a band of men and officers from the
   chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and
   weapons. How completely the traitor must have been in the power of
   Satan--and how hardened and callous he must have grown, that he could
   lead, "there," the men who were going to arrest the Savior! Truly it
   was by wicked hands that Christ was taken, crucified and slain! Yet,
   unconsciously, these evil men were carrying out "the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God." How strangely were they equipped for
   their deed of darkness! "With lanterns and torches and weapons." They
   were coming to the Light of the world bearing "lanterns and torches!"
   And armed with "weapons" that they might use against "the Lamb of God."
   If He had wished to deliver Himself, all their "weapons" would have
   been in vain--and their "lanterns and torches" would not have revealed
   Him, even with the help of the full moon, which was probably shining at
   the time.

   4. 5. Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should come upon Him,
   went forth and said unto them, Whom do you seek? They answered Him,
   Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I am He. And Judas also, which
   betrayed Him, stood with them. Notice, dear Friends, that the word,
   "He" is in italics, showing that it is not in the original. Our Lord
   here twice used the name of Jehovah, I AM--as He did on certain other
   memorable occasions. It was most fitting that, as He was going out to
   die, He should declare that it was no mere man who was about to suffer
   on the Cross, but that, while He was truly Man, He was also "very God
   of very God."

   6. As soon, then, as He had said unto them, I am He, they drew back and
   fell to the ground. The simple utterance of His name drove them from
   Him and drove them to the earth! What would have happened if He had put
   forth His almighty power?

   7-9. Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus
   of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told You that I am He. If,
   therefore, You seek Me, let these go their way: that the saying might
   be fulfilled, which He spoke, Of them which You gave Me, I have lost
   none.

Shining Christians

   (No. 2617)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 9, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 1, 1882.

   "Arise shine; for your light is come, and the Glory ofthe LORD is risen
   upon you." Isaiah 60:1.

   I BELIEVE that this text refers to the Church of God. I am aware that
   it is considered by some to have a special reference to Israel, but I
   also know that "no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
   interpretation," and that this particular Scripture may be most justly
   and fitly applied to every child of God. I pray the Holy Spirit to bear
   witness to that fact, even while I am speaking, by applying the text to
   all Believers who are assembled here. The first word of it is, "Arise."
   There is much need, dear Friends, that we should be, sometimes at
   least, awakened. Here are persons in the light--the day has dawned upon
   them, but they are fast asleep--so the trumpet is sounded in their ears
   and the watchman shouts aloud, "Arise, shine; for your light is come."
   I believe that there are some Christians who have wasted a large part
   of their lives for need of somebody or something to wake them up. There
   is more evil worked in the world by lack of thought than by downright
   malice and there is more good left undone through lack of thought than
   through any aversion to the doing of good! Some Christians appear to
   have been born in the land of slumber and they continually live in
   their native country of dreams. They occasionally rub their eyes and
   suppose themselves to be wide awake, but they are in the Enchanted
   Ground and though they know it not, they are little better than
   sleepwalkers most of their days.

   All of us may be conscious that, at times, we are startled into
   something better than our ordinary mode of life. We have been going on
   quietly, doing some good, but, all at once, we have been impressed with
   the value of an immortal soul--we have been struck with the nearness of
   eternity by the sudden death of a friend, or we have been awakened by
   the special application to our conscience of some eminently-powerful
   Scripture--or even the sight of some grievous sin has shocked us into
   holy action.

   For a time we have been quite different from our ordinary selves and
   those who have observed us have thought that there was more in us than
   they ever expected to see. Certainly more came out of us than we had
   ever seen before, but, alas, we have soon slipped back into our former
   quiescent state until, perhaps, something else of an unusual character
   has happened and startled us again. I have known some in whom, happily,
   the process of awakening has been a really effectual one. There came,
   once, to a meeting I was addressing, a Brother who had been, for years,
   earnest after the ordinary fashion of Christian young men--and the Lord
   so guided me that I spoke about the usefulness that some men might
   acquire if they would but bestir themselves. I urged the desirability
   of some attempting to preach in the street, who might find their gifts
   abundant for that work,

   Well, this young man went back and tried what he could do for Christ
   and God greatly blessed him. That young man was Mr. W. P. Lockhart, of
   Liverpool, who is, at this moment, pastor of the church meeting in the
   Toxteth Tabernacle, a large edifice erected by the people whom he
   gathered by his preaching! Our friend has, with much acceptance,
   occupied this pulpit and been of great service to our denomination.
   But, if it had not been for God's awakening him under that particular
   address, he might have remained just the ordinary trader that he was,
   serving the Lord in a very proper way, but nothing noteworthy might
   have come of it. I wonder whether there is anybody here who needs, as
   it were, to be dragged out and impressed into the service of
   Christ--some Brother, perhaps, from Liverpool, or Manchester, or
   Birmingham, or Glasgow, or from this great London, itself--someone who
   is "not slothful in business," yet not "fervent in spirit, serving the
   Lord." Such a man may be, really, a fine fellow with great capacity,
   but most of his talent is latent and dormant so far as the Word of Cod
   is concerned.

   My dear Friend, you have been sluggish quite long enough. Is it not
   time for me to cry to you, "Arise," and is it not time for you to lift
   yourself up from that couch of indolence, and say, "Yes, I have been
   hearing sermons for a good long while. I have been a member of a
   Christian Church and have been attending communions for many years. It
   is high time that I ceased from sloth and began to do something to show
   that God is with me and in me and, by His Grace, so it shall be"? Happy
   will the preacher be if that shall be the result of calling your
   attention to this first word of the text, "Arise." We all need to hear
   the clarion call of Charles Wesley's hymn--

   "Soldiers of Christ, arise

   And put your armor on!

   Strong in the strength which God supplies

   Through His eternal Son!"

   It is high time that all of us did arise. "Let us not sleep, as do
   others." Loved by our God from all eternity, predestinated unto
   everlasting life, bought with the precious blood of Jesus, helped by
   the Spirit of God, and indwelt by Him, it is, indeed, time that we did
   something worthy of our pedigree, something worthy of the price with
   which we have been bought, something worthy of the love which set us
   apart unto itself before the world was! I have no doubt that I am
   addressing some who do not lack grace--God has given them that. They
   are not without a saving knowledge of the truth--they do know Christ,
   but what they need is somebody to start them on a higher and nobler
   career. There are some who are just like Elijah's sacrifice, with the
   wood all laid in order on the altar, and the bullock on the wood. O
   Lord, send the fire from Heaven, that the sacrifice may be completely
   consumed! Let the man be given to you as a whole burnt offering unto
   the Most High! It may be that this poor weak hand may strike the match
   that shall set that sacrifice on a blaze. So may it be, and God shall
   have all the Glory!

   The text says, "Arise," but then it goes on to say, "Arise, shine; for
   your light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon you." In
   these words I see three things for me to do. First, to remind you of
   your privilege--"your light is come." Secondly, to awaken you to your
   service--"Arise, shine." And then, thirdly, to rally you to your work,
   by a few remarks which the context will suggest.

   I. I am now speaking only to the people of God. There are some of you
   whose light has never come, but you are in darkness even now. The Lord
   have mercy upon you, but, to God's own people who have believed in the
   Lord Jesus, this is my first message, REMEMBER YOUR PRIVILEGE. Your
   light has come!

   Remember, first, out of what darkness that Light of God has delivered
   you. You are no longer in the darkness of sin, the darkness of
   spiritual ignorance, the darkness of spiritual death. Neither are you
   any longer in that darkness of distress and despair which might be
   felt. You are now in the Light of God, but think a little while of what
   your state of darkness used to be. It is not so many years ago that
   there was a young man who did not know his right hand from his left in
   spiritual things. He put darkness for light, and light for darkness,
   bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter--but that man, not as young now,
   knows the Savior--he has learned the evil of sin and he has rejoiced in
   all the delights of pardon! Was that young man yourself? If so, you may
   well prize your present privileges. It is not so long ago that there
   was a man who was in the darkness of soul-agony. His sin was heavy upon
   him. God's hand pressed him till all the moisture of his being seemed
   to exude and he was like a plant withered in the long droughts of
   autumn. He cried to the Lord, but for a while he received no response
   to his petitions. He begged for mercy, but it did not come.

   Now, that same person is sitting here, thankful that he is pardoned and
   that he knows how he has been delivered from the wrath of God! And he
   blesses that Divine Substitute who took upon Himself his sin and with
   it that sin's penalty, and so delivered the guilty one from the wrath
   to come. Oh, what a change there is in that young man! That young man
   is yourself, is he not? Sister, it has been the same with you, too! Oh,
   what a difference there is between the knowledge which God the Holy
   Spirit has imparted to you--and the blindness in which Satan held you
   captive! Oh, the difference between the misery into which conviction
   and despair had brought you--and the peace and restfulness which you
   feel at this moment through faith in Jesus Christ, your Lord and
   Savior! Is it not true that your light has come, and do you not bless
   God for it? Oh, I think you must and that you will use that blessed
   fact to help me in my argument when I come to enforce the lesson of the
   text--"Arise, shine; for your light is come." If God has given you
   light out of such horrible darkness, it well becomes you to shine to
   His praise as brightly as you can!

   Please notice, next, that this light, which God has given you, is His
   own Glory. "And the Glory of the Lord is risen upon you." Oh, but that
   is wonderful--that God would not only give us light, but that that
   light should be His own Glory! Creation is a part of God's Glory, but
   it is only a moonlight Glory compared with that of Redemption! God, in
   the gift of Jesus Christ, displayed the whole of His Nature. Creation
   is not a canvas large enough for the whole image of God to be stamped
   upon it. Byron speaks of God's face being mirrored in the sea, but
   there is not space enough for the face of Deity to be fully reflected
   in the broad Atlantic, or in all the oceans put together! The image of
   God is to be fully seen in Jesus Christ, and nowhere else, for there
   you behold attributes which Creation cannot display. Creation can
   manifest love, power, wisdom and much else, but how can Creation
   manifest justice, and justice lying side by side with mercy, like the
   lion and the lamb? It is only in Christ that you can see this wondrous
   sight--God hating sin with perfect hatred, but yet loving sinners with
   much more than the tenderness of a mother towards her child!

   It is upon you, dear Friend, that this light of the Glory of God has
   fallen. In your history, in your case, the Glory of God's attributes
   has been illustrated. You have seen it, yourself, in a measure, and
   others are also to see it in you. Your light has come, the Glory of the
   Lord has risen upon you. Therefore, God's Glory is to shine through you
   and in you, and by you, and through you God shall manifest Himself to
   angels and principalities and powers in the ages yet to come! I confess
   that I am talking about what I do not fully understand. I am quite out
   of my depth here. I see the light of the Glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ, but to describe it is quite impossible. When I first saw
   the electric light, if you had asked me what it was like, I could have
   only told you something about its candle-power or its brilliance in
   comparison with gas, but I could not have made you understand it. But
   what is the electric light compared with the glory of the sun to one
   who sees it for the first time? And what are all the suns that could
   ever be created compared with the wondrous blaze of the Glory of God?
   Yet such a marvelous light as that has fallen upon you, my Brother, my
   Sister--"the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ."

   There is also this blessed thing to be said about this Light of
   God--you will never lose it. I dwell upon that thought for a minute,
   that you may rejoice in it. Read the 30th verse. "Your sun shall no
   more go down, neither shall your moon withdraw itself: for the Lord
   shall be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be
   ended." The light that God has given you will never be taken away from
   you! Ah, you have feared a good many times that it would be, but it
   never has and it never will! You have put your hand before your eyes
   and then you have thought that the sun was blotted out, but it was not.
   Clouds have sometimes arisen between you and your God, but the light of
   His everlasting love has gone on shining all the while and so it always
   will. We bless God that we have not to preach to you of temporary
   salvation, a salvation that saves people for a quarter of a year, or
   that saves them for a few years and then away they go back, again, to
   the world! No, no, our comforts may be slower in the making than are
   those of others, but they last when they are made, for they are made by
   the Grace of God! We are not saved by a sudden jump into something--we
   know not what--but by a new creation, by a new birth, by a total and
   radical change. Now, if the Light of God has risen upon you in that
   way, so as to change your very heart and the whole nature of your
   being, that Light will go on shining forever! Drink in that thought.
   You have, by Grace, laid hold of that which you will never lose and One
   has laid hold of you who will never let you slip out of His grasp, for
   it is written, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
   follow Me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
   perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."

   I must not get on that glorious theme of the Final Preservation of the
   Saints because it is one that always sets my heart leaping with delight
   whenever I turn to it! But I say to you that if you take away from me
   the Doctrine of the Final Perseverance of the Saints and all that is
   involved in it, I have not anything left that is worth keeping! I
   should not care about the Gospel if that essential feature of it were
   gone. That Truth of God seems to me to be the very soul of it--
   everlasting love making an everlasting covenant and taking the objects
   of that everlasting love into everlasting union with Christ and giving
   them everlasting life by virtue of that union with Him! So, Believer,
   that light of yours will never burn out--it shall shine on forever and
   ever. "Your light has come" and it shall never go away. Oh, joy, joy,
   joy! Let God be praised continually for such a blessed gift as this!

   Now I must leave that part of my subject, only asking you to turn it
   over in your minds and to rejoice if the text is true of you, "Your
   light is come." I wish that some here who have been in the dark till
   now, might know it to be true in their case, and each one be able to
   say, "I do believe! I will believe in Christ Jesus as my Savior." If
   you do, your light has come!

   II. But I am going to speak further to those who know that their light
   hascome. Dear Friends, as soon as you have received this light of the
   Glory of God--this very same light that makes Heaven what it is--this
   light which never will be dim and which you will never lose--I want to
   push you on to my second point, which is this, TO AWAKEN YOU TO
   SERVICE. "Arise, shine; for your light is come." A man cannot shine if
   he has not any light, but as soon as ever he has the Light of God, what
   is he to do? Why, shine, of course! He must not put away his light as
   in a dark lantern, but the moment he receives it, he is bound to show
   it!

   First, my dear Friend, since your light has come, shine by holy
   cheerfulness. I am very sorry whenever I meet with Christians who have
   no joy. I am most of all vexed with myself whenever my own joy burns
   dimly, for we who have the light of the Glory of God ought to have
   shining faces. We have been forgiven! We are God's children! We are on
   the way to Heaven! Then, surely, if anybody's mouth ought to be full of
   laughter and if any tongue should be tuned to sweetest music, it should
   certainly be ours! There are none who have such a right to lead
   perfectly happy lives as Christians. I know that there are some who I
   cannot doubt are good people, but who are a very surly sort of folk.
   Dear Hearts, they will be all right when they get to Heaven, but I
   would not like to meet a Heaven full of them if they are in Heaven as
   they are here! There are some persons who never can be content.
   Providence never pleases them. The weather is always wrong. Their
   dinners are always ill cooked--nothing goes right, nothing has gone
   right with them for years--and they are very snappish and snarling.

   This style of living will not do, my Brother! "Arise, shine." I would
   like to lay those words on your breakfast plate tomorrow morning.
   Before you go out to business, put this passage between two pieces of
   bread and butter, "Arise, shine; for your light is come." It may be
   that you will wake up in the morning rather gloomy and you will say to
   yourself, "I have to go out and battle with the world again." Take this
   text, "Arise, shine; for your light is come," and say to yourself, "I
   must shine. Come, come, come, come, come! I must not let myself get
   down in the dumps, I must not begin the day mourning. God has given me
   light, so I must and I will shine to His praise and Glory." May God
   help you to do it, for that is one way in which we can adorn the Gospel
   of Jesus Christ, our Savior, by the cheerfulness of our deportment!

   The next way of shining is by a gracious godliness. True Christians
   ought to shine by their lives. The stars do not say anything, but they
   keep on shining. Did you look up at the sky, the other night, and see
   Jupiter hard by the moon and Saturn apparently just a little way off?
   There has been a wonderful beauty about various planets during the past
   month--perhaps never was the sky more interesting than it has been of
   late, but never a word was said among the shining bodies in the
   heavens! I kept company with the pole star, I think, for 12 long hours
   as I was traveling home from the South of France I kept seeing him out
   of the carriage window. He never said a word to me all the time, but
   one thing he did do, he continued shining! And I also gazed at all the
   stars of Ursa Major, as I remained wakeful the whole night long, but
   not a syllable did they say to me. They do not need to speak, for they
   shine! In like manner, you Christian people who cannot talk--the women
   especially. I mean that you cannot preach, you are not allowed to
   preach--I want you to shine. Some people seem to think that there is no
   shining without talking, whereas the very best shining is that of
   Christian women, who, if they have little to say, have a great deal to
   do. They make the house so bright with heavenly grace and decorate it
   so sweetly with the flowers of their cheerful piety, that those round
   about them are won to Christ by them! Therefore, shine, dear Brothers
   and Sisters, by your gracious godliness, for so you will bring Glory to
   God!

   Then, thirdly, shine by zealous earnestness. We do not often meet with
   people who are too much in earnest. I can only thank God that I hear,
   in certain places, an outcry against fanaticism. We have been such a
   long time without it, so we may be almost glad to have a little of it,
   especially as the so-called fanaticism is probably only zeal thoroughly
   awakened. If there are some people who seem to be wildly enthusiastic,
   let us imitate them! We have had so much slumbering, so much coldness,
   so much death, that we can put up with a little extravagance and
   excess. Still it would be better if, judiciously, one went steaming
   straight ahead in the service of God with a resolution never to be
   beaten, never to cease every earnest endeavor to make known the Gospel
   of Christ--and to reflect the Light of God which has shone upon us from
   above! Oh, for a zealous earnestness! May God pour it out upon this
   Church yet more abundantly! May you go into your Master's service with
   all your might and main, and may the Spirit of God, as a spirit of
   burning, rest upon everyone of you far more abundantly than in the
   past!

   This would lead, dear Friends, to your shining by a secret bravery.
   There are some dear people whom I must encourage to be a little more
   bold. We have some friends, here and there, to whom I could hint, only
   very gently, that they are quite forward enough, but there are many
   good people who always keep in the background. They might do so much
   for Christ if only they had a little courage! Do, dear Friends, break
   through the ice this year! If you have felt that you ought to do
   something for your Lord, and yet have never begun to do it, begin at
   once! Do you ask, "What is the best way to try to serve Christ?" Well,
   I think the best way is to doit. "But how should I begin?" Well, I
   would begin by beginning! "When shall I begin?" Begin now! This very
   hour. "But in what way?" In the first way that comes to hand--"whatever
   your hand finds to do, do it with all your might," for our text says,
   "Arise, shine." If you have the Light of God, emit it, distribute it,
   scatter it somehow or other! Have pluck--that is a plain English word,
   but I do not know how to put my meaning better. Have pluck enough to
   come out and be a Christian--do not always be like a rat behind the
   wall, but come out and acknowledge yourself on Jesus Christ's side and
   promote the everlasting Gospel wherever you have the opportunity!

   So runs the text, "Arise, shine; for your light is come."

   III. Now, in closing, I want TO RALLY YOU TO THIS SHINING BY ONE OR TWO
   ARGUMENTS.

   And, first, by the world's great need. Read the second verse of this
   chapter--"Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
   darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon you, and His Glory
   shall be seen upon you." Oh, the darkness and the death shade still
   over the people! Over this London of ours there hangs a pall of deadly
   nightshade, a darkness that may be felt! Then, little glowworm, even
   you must not hide your light! Sparks, tiny sparks, you that have but
   one little flash, you must not conceal it, for the night is dark, and
   the darkness deepens! The devil, drunkenness and lewdness, Romanism in
   all its forms, false doctrine, infidel teaching, skepticism in a
   thousand shapes--all these make night hideous and further deepen the
   dense shades of darkness! You who have the light--show it! If it is not
   the Light of God, say so, and renounce it. But if it is the Light of
   God, in the name of the eternal God, good man, I pray you, let your
   light be seen! Arise, shine; for darkness covers the earth, and gross
   darkness the people!

   Shine, next, because of the great results that will surely come of it.
   If all Christians were once to shine--and that means if you were to
   shine, and your neighbor, and I and my neighbor--if all of us were to
   shine, then it would come to pass that Gentiles would speed to the
   Light of God, and kings to the brightness of the rising! Then, from all
   lands and from the sea, would converts come, till nations should crowd
   to Christ like flocks of doves flying to their dovecotes. And the
   Church of God would be multiplied beyond all count. We often keep from
   work for Christ because we despair of its success. We neglect effort
   because we are afraid that effort will be useless. Doubt no longer! He
   that bids you sow intends to give a harvest and He will bless your
   sowing if you will but sow in faith. We may well be encouraged to do so
   when we think such thoughts as these, "Shine, for your light shall be
   seen; shine, for your light shall be useful to save lives like a
   lighthouse on the rock--useful to direct others home, like the
   cottager's candle in the window to guide her husband to his resting
   place." Shine, then, because of the good that will come of it to the
   world.

   Shine, next, because of the great blessing that it will bring to the
   Church, for, if all Christians rally to serve God as they should, then
   shall the Church have the days of her great glory--"The glory of
   Lebanon shall come unto you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box
   together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the
   place of My feet glorious. The sons, also, of them that afflicted you,
   shall come bending unto you; and all they that despised you shall bow
   themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall call you The
   City of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. Whereas you have
   been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through you, I will make
   you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations." A shining Church
   will be a happy Church, but if we do not shine, we will be miserable.
   But if we will shine for Christ, we shall see great prosperity for the
   Church of the living God!

   And, best of all, we must do this because of the argument used in the
   21st verse. I will not speak upon it, I shall leave it with you--"that
   I may be glorified." It is God your Father who says that! It is Christ
   who has bought you with His blood who says it! It is the Holy Spirit
   who is your indwelling Comforter who says it! There is no argument that
   eloquence could state, or that reason could suggest that can have such
   force with a loyal heart as this--"that I might be glorified." Do you
   not pray, "Father, glorify Your Son"? Now, in the power of the Holy
   Spirit, prove the sincerity of your prayer by giving out whatever light
   God has given to you and, since your light has come, arise and shine,
   as you have ability, from this very hour! The Lord grant it, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, to me and to you, for His name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 103; ISAIAH 59:16-21; ISAIAH
   60:1-16.

   What more appropriate passage than the 103rd Psalm can we read, on this
   first Sabbath night of another year, to express the gratitude of our
   thankful hearts? I will only interject a sentence here and there, but
   let me beg all to try to worship God in the spirit while we once more
   read together the familiar words of this much-loved Psalm.

   Psalm 103:1. Bless the LORD, Omysoul. O my Soul, be not thoughtless and
   wandering, but give this holy hour to the sacred employment of praising
   and blessing your God!

   1. And all that is within me, bless His holy name. Let every string of
   my heart be now touched by the fingers of the Holy Spirit, let every
   faculty of my being wake up to praise the Lord--"and all that is within
   me, bless His holy name."

   2. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits. They are
   very memorable. They deserve to be "engraved as in eternal brass." To
   be forgetful of them will be a base form of ingratitude. Come, my
   memory, wake up! "Forget not all His benefits." Here are a few of the
   choicest of the gems in this cabinet--the jewels are too many for me to
   exhibit them all.

   3. Who forgives all your iniquities. The Lord has done it and continues
   to do it--"who forgives"--not some of your iniquities, but all of them,
   so that you can sing, "The depths have covered them: there is not one
   of them left." Why, there is enough to sing of in that, alone! We need
   never leave off praising God for that one mercy of forgiven sin --it is
   the first of God's favors and prepares us to enjoy the rest.

   3. Who heals all your diseases. Many times has my heart had to sing
   about the gift from my God of this precious pearl, "who heals all your
   diseases," and some of you have also had occasion, in your restored
   health, to praise the Lord for this privilege. But, oh, to think that,
   every day, He is healing us of the great disease of sin--our very
   afflictions being, often but the lancet and the knife with which He is
   removing from us the foul taint of evil. "Who heals all your diseases."

   4. Who redeems your life from destruction. You have a life that can
   never die, for He has redeemed it. Then, bless your Lord for
   Redemption! If you do not sing for this cause, the very stones in the
   street will cry out against you!

   4. Who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies. What a
   crown! What gems are on it! No gold or silver can ever equal
   this--"loving kindness and tender mercies." Every child of God is a
   crowned king--shall we not, for this, also, sing aloud, "Bless the
   Lord, O my soul"?

   5. Who satisfies your mouth with good things; so that your youth is
   renewed like the eagle's. If you enjoy sweet inward contentment and
   satisfaction with your God, you must praise Him, "who satisfies your
   mouth with good things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's"
   With renewed strength, can you, will you, be silent? I am sure you
   cannot, but you must use all the strength that God has given back to
   you to His praise and Glory.

   6. The LORD executes righteousness and judgment for all that are
   oppressed. Blessed be His name for this! He is the supreme Governor of
   the world and He will rectify all its wrongs in His own time and way.
   There is a great power that makes for righteousness and that power is
   on the Throne of God. "The Lord reigns."

   7-9. He made known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children of
   Israel The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
   in mercy. He will not always chide: neither will He keep His anger
   forever Let your heart keep praising the Lord as we read every one of
   these sentences, for there is a theme for everlasting music in each
   line of this Psalm. "He will not always chide," Hallelujah! "Neither
   will he keep His anger forever." And again we say, "Hallelujah !"

   10. He has not dealt with us after our sins. Blessed be His holy name!

   10. Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. Forever adored be His
   long-suffering and His tender mercy.

   11. For as the Heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy
   toward them that fear Him. Therefore praise

   Him--

   "Loud as His thunders, shout His praise,

   And sound it lofty as His throne!"

   If He is such a God as this, you can never overdo His praises. It is
   impossible to exaggerate your exaltation of Him!

   12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our
   transgressions from us. They are gone! They are removed to an infinite
   distance--they will never come back. It is not possible that they
   should ever again be laid to our charge.

   13. Like as a father pities his children, so the LORDpities them that
   fear Him. Do not stop the music of thanksgiving. Let your hearts, if
   not your voices, keep on saying, "Bless the Lord! Bless the Lord!" Oh,
   what pity you and I have needed! What tenderness and compassion! And--

   "Such pity as a father has Unto his children dear"--

   such pity has God had upon us!

   14-16. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust As for
   man, his days are asgrass: as a flower ofthe field, so he flourishes.
   For the windpasses over it, andit is gone; and the place thereof shall
   know it no more. As a congregation, we have had most grievous proof of
   this Truth of God during the last two or three months. It has seemed to
   me as if everybody was dying. Our ranks have been thinned wondrously--

   "And we are to the margin come, And we expect to die."

   17-19. But the mercy ofthe LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon
   them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children; to
   such as keep His Covenant, and to those that remember His Commandments
   to do them. The LORD has prepared His Throne in the heavens; and His
   kingdom rules over all Do not believe the people who attribute sickness
   and death to the devil, and so try to make it appear that God has left
   His Throne. He still reigns! He reigns forever, "King of kings, and
   Lord of lords, Hallelujah!" "Bless the Lord, O my soul!" "The Lord has
   prepared His Throne in the heavens; and His kingdom rules over all."

   20-22. Bless the LORD, you His angels, that excel in strength, that do
   His Commandments, hearkening unto the voice ofHis Word. Blessyou the
   LORD, allyou His hosts;you ministers ofHis that do Hispleasure. Bless
   the LORD, all His works in all places ofHis dominion: bless the LORD, O
   my soul. For well you may, O my Soul, for the Lord has dealt
   bountifully with you! Lead the song and may the whole world join you in
   joyful adoration of the Triune Jehovah, Father, Son and Holy Spirit!
   Now we will read the passage that especially relates to the message I
   have to deliver to you presently in my Master's name. Turn to Isaiah
   59, verse 16--

   Isaiah 59:16. And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there
   was no intercessor: therefore His arm brought salvation unto Him; and
   His righteousness, it sustained Him. Man's extremity was Christ's
   opportunity. There was no one left to save poor fallen manhood, no one
   who could lift a hand or a finger for our rescue. Therefore, Jesus
   came, and fought, and bled, and died, and conquered on our behalf.

   17-19. For He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
   salvation upon His head; and He put on the garments of vengeance for
   clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. According to their deeds,
   accordingly He will repay fury to His adversaries, recompense to His
   enemies; to the islands He will repay recompense. So shall they fear
   the name ofthe LORD from the west, and His Glory from the rising ofthe
   sun. Christ came once and He is to come a second time because He will
   be again needed here. And when He returns, He will ease Himself of His
   adversaries, and speedily win the victory for truth and righteousness.
   Then shall the whole earth know what Christ can do.

   19-21. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit ofthe LORD
   shall lift up a standard against him. And the redeemer shall come to
   Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, says the
   LORD. As for Me, this is My Covenant with them, says the LORD; My
   Spirit that is upon you, and My Words which Ihave put in your month,
   shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out ofthe mouth of your seed,
   nor out ofthe mouth of your seed's seed, says the LORD, from henceforth
   and forever. The Church of God shall have the Spirit of Truth and the
   Word of Truth ever abiding in her midst. God will not break His
   Covenant by withdrawing His Spirit from His Church. The Redeemer has
   come and His work of Redemption is accomplished. The Spirit also has
   come, but His work is not as yet done--it is being performed from day
   to day and the Spirit will never be withdrawn while any part of His
   ministry remains unfulfilled. The consequence of all this is the Glory
   of the true Church of the living God. There are better days coming for
   the cause of Christ and of His Truth. Listen, and be encouraged, all
   you that are heavy of heart!

   Isaiah 60:1-3. Arise, shine; for your lightt is come, and the Glory of
   the LORD is risen upon you. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the
   earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon
   you, and His Glory shall be seen upon you. And the Gentiles shall come
   to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. The Church
   of God is one, whether it is among Jews or Gentiles. That poor Church
   seemed abandoned and forsaken. Dark days came and it looked as if the
   Church must even cease to exist, but it did not. Now God has brought in
   many sinners of the Gentiles and He will bring them in much more
   numerously in the future times of refreshing. They shall come in
   armies, in hosts, in nations--and the Church of God shall be
   exceedingly glorious!

   4,5. Lift up your eyes round about and see: all they gather themselves
   together, they come to you: your sons shall come from far, and your
   daughters shall be nursed at your side. Then you shall see, and flow
   together, and your heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the
   abundance of the sea shall be converted unto you, the forces of the
   Gentiles shall come unto you. All the strength of the land and of the
   sea--the armies and the navies shall come and prostrate themselves
   before the Church of God. The supreme power on earth shall yet be the
   Christ in the midst of His Church.

   6. The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian
   and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come. The Easterns shall bow
   before the King; they that of old had some light shall come to the yet
   greater light. In those holy lands which afterwards became so unholy,
   there shall yet be a return to the Truth of God and all the false
   prophets shall be expelled. Where Mohammed's crescent has cursed the
   nations, there shall shine again the Sun of Righteousness, with healing
   in His wings.

   6, 7. They shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the
   praises of the LORD. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together
   unto you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto you: they shall come
   up with acceptance on My altar, and I will glorify the house of My
   Glory. Wandering tribes of wild Arabs shall come and bow before Christ,
   and lay their wealth at His feet.

   8. Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
   windows?The growing Church sees a greater multitude coming to her than
   even the populous East could muster. From where do they come? Listen,
   Brothers and Sisters, and look around and see for yourselves.

   9. Surely the isles shall wait forMe, and the ships ofTarshish first,
   to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them,
   unto the name of the LORD your God, and to the Holy One of Israel,
   because He has glorified you. In ships from these remote islands, and
   from countries that were dimly spoken of, in the East, as, "lands of
   Tarshish," far away, great multitudes were to come to Christ. Are they
   not coming today from this Ultima Thule, this distant land beyond the
   pillars of Hercules, are they not coming to Christ "as a cloud, and as
   the doves to their windows"?

   10-16. And the sons of strangers shall build up your walls, and their
   kings shall minister unto you: for in My wrath I smote you, but in My
   favor have I had mercy on you. Therefore your gates shall be
   continually open; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may
   bring unto you the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be
   brought. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall
   perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted. The glory of
   Lebanon shall come unto you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box
   together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the
   place of My feet glorious. The sons, also, of them that afflicted you
   shall come bending unto you; and all they that despised you shall bow
   themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall call you, The
   City of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. Whereas you have
   been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through you, I will make
   you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. You shall also
   drink the milk of the Gentiles, and milk the breast of kings: and you
   shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the
   Mighty One of Jacob. In God's good time, all this shall come to pass.

"Straightway"

   (No. 2618)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 16, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 15, 1882.

   "They straightway left their nets, and followed Him." Matthew 4:20.

   "THEY straightway left their nets." Immediately, without hesitation,
   without question. At once, on the spot, then and there,
   instantaneously--at the Master's call they "left their nets, and
   followed Him." It was one mark of our Savior's authority and power
   that. when He commanded, men obeyed. Your memories will help you to
   recall many instances in which persons and even inanimate things
   instantly obeyed when Christ gave them the word of command. Satan and
   legions of demons, diseases of every kind and even winds and
   waves--those things which usually seem to be lawless and wild always
   gave heed to the Law which issued from His lips. When He spoke, it was
   done, for His Word was with power.

   This is a mark of the effectual calling by Divine Grace--whenever it
   comes, men are led "straightway" to obey it. I may call you as long as
   I please, yet you will not come to Christ for all my calling. But if
   Christ shall call you by His Spirit, you will come. Yes, and come
   "straightway." When the command of Christ is applied to the soul with
   Divine energy, there is an immediate yielding of the heart to Him and
   His Law is obeyed. Judge yourselves, therefore, dear Friends, whether
   the Word of God has come with power to you or not, for if it has not
   come with almighty power, but you merely hear it as I speak it, you
   will say to me, as Felix said to Paul, "Go your way for a time; when I
   have a convenient season, I will call for you." But if the Truth of God
   proclaimed shall be accompanied with the energy of the Holy Spirit,
   then, as soon as the Lord says, "Seek you My face," your heart will
   respond to Him, "Your face, Lord, will I seek." Pray to the Lord, you
   who have heard and answered the call of His Spirit, that the same call
   may be given to others, and be effectually applied to them, to the
   praise of the Glory of God's Grace.

   I am going to use, in two ways, one word in my text--"straightway."
   First, I suggest that this word, "straightway," should be a motto for
   all Christians. All disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ should take that
   word as their guiding star! Secondly, let all seekers take if as their
   motto, too--"straightway." If you would find Christ, seek Him at once--
   "straightway."

   I. First, then, let this word, "straightway," be THE MOTTO OF EVERY
   DISCIPLE OF THE LORD JESUS

   CHRIST.

   When I preached, many years ago, in the cathedral at Geneva, after the
   service was ended, the Brothers presented me with a large bronze
   commemorative medal of John Calvin, on which is this passage, "He
   endured, as seeing Him who is invisible," which was a most suitable
   motto text for him. Upon the covers of his works are these words, which
   are also truly descriptive of the man, "Prompte et sincere in opere
   Domini"--"Prompt and sincere in the work of the Lord." I was pleased
   with both those mottos and my prayer, then, was, and still is, that
   they may both be mine as well as Calvin's. I pray that I may endure, as
   seeing Him who is invisible, and that I may also live to earn that
   other commendation, "prompt and sincere in the work of the Lord."
   Sincere, I trust we all are, who love the Savior, but we are not all as
   prompt as we are sincere! You know, in business, people like a man of
   prompt payments upon whom they can always depend. We also like persons
   to be prompt in carrying out their promises, but, oh, to be prompt in
   the work of the Lord, so as to not only do the right thing, but to do
   it at the right time--and that right time almost always is the time
   suggested by my text, "straightway." "Whatever your hand finds to do,
   do it with all your might," and do it at once. Leave it not to lie by
   among the lumber of good intentions, but if you are prompted to do it,
   set to work and do it immediately!

   "Straightway," then, is to be the motto of the Christian, first, in
   obeying Christ's Laws. The moment, my dear Friend, that you find
   yourself in the Kingdom of Heaven by faith in Christ, endeavor to be a
   loyal, Law-keeping subject. Mary said to the servants at the marriage
   feast of Cana, concerning her Son, "Whatever He says unto you, do it."
   And I say the same. "Whatever He says unto you"--He whom you have now
   taken to be your Lord and King--do not merely talk about it, or think
   of it, but do it and do it at once! "I counsel you," said Solomon, "to
   keep the King's commandment." Take Solomon's advice and let me add as a
   rider to it, "Keep the King's commandments straightway." As soon as
   ever a man becomes a Believer in Christ, the next step for him to take
   is to be baptized. The two things are constantly joined together in the
   New Testament. Our Lord said, "He that believes and is baptized shall
   be saved." When the eunuch came to a certain water, he asked Philip,
   "What does hinder me to be baptized?" Philip answered, "If you believe
   with all your heart, you may." I add to that, "If you believe with all
   your heart, you not only may, but you are bound to do it according to
   the Law of the Kingdom of Christ!" Do you tell me that you cannot see
   it to be your duty? I would advise you candidly to search the
   Scriptures and find out the teaching and practice of our Lord and His
   Apostles concerning Believers' Baptism. If, after that, you still say
   the same, I must leave you to your Master--I am not your judge.

   I hope there will be no question with any of you who love the Lord
   about the next point. It is the duty of every Believer in Christ to
   come to His Table. He said, "This do in remembrance of Me." He bids us
   gather in His name and commemorate His death in the breaking of bread
   and the pouring out of wine. So how can you say that you are His
   obedient disciple if you have lived, to now, in total negligence of
   that great commemorative ordinance? "Straightway," Friend--
   "straightway" obey boththe ordinances of the Kingdom--and delay no
   longer!

   "Straightway," also, unite yourself with the people of God. Christ's
   servants--Christ's blood-bought ones--are called "sheep." Sheep are
   gregarious creatures--they always go in flocks. Join yourself to your
   Brothers and Sisters somewhere. If they are evilly spoken of, go and be
   evilly spoken of with them. Do not attempt to fare better than the rest
   of your Master's servants, but take up Christ's Cross and follow Him.
   Give yourselves first to Christ and afterwards to us, or to some other
   Christian Church, according to the will of God. And do this
   "straightway!" And whatever else appears to be the Law of the
   House--and the Law of Christ's House is very plainly written in the
   Gospels and the Epistles--obey the Law of the House--and obey it
   "straightway."

   Next, dear Friends, make this word, "straightway," your motto in
   entrance upon Christian service. Do you ask, "When should a Believer
   begin to work for Christ?" I answer, "Straightway." There are no
   laborers for the Master who are so useful as those who begin to be
   useful while they are young. Sometimes God converts men in mid life, or
   even in old age, and uses them in His service, but, still, I venture to
   assert that Church History will show that the most useful servants of
   Christ were those who were caught early and who, from their youth up,
   bore testimony to the Gospel of Christ. At any rate, as soon as you are
   converted, I pray you to begin to do something for Jesus so as to get
   your hand in for future labor. In the case of some old people who have
   been professors of religion for years, but who have done next to
   nothing for Christ, I find it very difficult to ever stir them up at
   all. When I do get a saddle on them, they are very restless creatures,
   like a horse that has never been broken in--but if I break them in
   while they are colts, they get used to their work, it becomes a delight
   to them and they would not be happy unless they had something to do for
   the Lord Jesus! If Christ has redeemed, you, Beloved, and you know it,
   get to His service "straightway." Let there be no delay whatever, but
   at once commence to labor for your Lord!

   I remember having a considerable share of sneers and rebukes from some
   who thought themselves very wise men because I began preaching at the
   age of sixteen. I was recommended to tarry at Jericho till my beard had
   grown, and a great many other pieces of advice were given to me, but I
   confess that I have never regretted that I was a "boy-preacher" of the
   Word of God--and if I could have my time over, again, I would like to
   do just the same as I did then. O you young men who are just converted,
   try to serve God at once, for, if you idle away your years until the
   boy has ripened into a full-grown man and his beard adorns his chin, I
   question whether he will not be "a lazy-beard" all the rest of his
   life. No, no--get to work at once--"straightway!" Find out your niche
   and stand in it. Ask the Master to allot you your portion of the great
   harvest field and go to work in it with all your might. And keep on at
   it, God helping you, till your dying day. "Straightway," then, is to be
   your motto concerning the service of the Master.

   And while I give this motto for the commencement of our whole lifework,
   I beg to propose it to all Christian friends as a suitable motto for
   each work as it arises. If there is anything good to be done, when
   shall I do it? "Straightway." There is no time like the present for the
   fulfillment of a good design. How many excellent projects have been
   postponed for a time and, therefore, never carried out for the benefit
   of men! Now, dear Friends, especially you who have your children around
   you, if you ask me, "When shall I commence to train them for God?" I
   answer, "Straightway." "But they are so young." Well, never mind how
   young they are, you will find bad tempers and many other evils
   springing up from the hearts of even the smallest children! And the
   time to repress them is as soon as they appear. You will find that
   Satan will take the earliest hour that he can find for doing his deadly
   work. He is always up early in the morning and he will try, if he can,
   to sow the tares in that little plot of ground. Take as early an hour
   as Satan takes and ask God, by His Grace, that you may teach your child
   the things of eternal life "straightway." I would say to you, dear
   Mother, if you have never talked with your daughter about her soul, do
   it this very night. "But," you reply, "when I get home, she will be in
   bed." If so, then wake her up, but do talk and pray with her tonight!
   And then let her fall asleep again. Begin this holy service at once if
   you have neglected it until now.

   And you, dear Father, if you have never yet personally spoken to your
   children about the Savior, you cannot tell the power you might have
   over them if you would do so. I shall never forget when my father spoke
   to me, as a boy, about my soul, and asked me to pray. I remember with
   what shamefacedness I declined the attempt--and how wounded I felt, in
   my heart, to think that I was not able to pray. I had my groans and
   crying unto God in secret, but they were deepened and intensified by
   the question that he had put to me. O dear parents, do begin at once,
   that they may become God's children while yet they are your children! A
   little boy once said, "Father, please take me to Chapel with you
   tonight." "My Dear," the father replied, "you are too young. I will
   take you when you grow older." "Father," answered the child, "if I
   don't go now, very likely when I get older, I shall not want to go at
   all." And, alas, that is often the case! Take them, therefore, while
   they are yet little, where they may get a benefit to their souls and
   "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."

   Then, with regard to any individuals with whom you may meet, take care
   to speak to them about the Savior. If you ask me when you shall speak
   to them, I answer, "Straightway"--tomorrow morning, across the counter,
   or in the workshop, or whenever there is a quiet minute or two that you
   can use. Perhaps the friend to whom you think of speaking may be dead
   if you delay until the end of the week, so go to him "straightway."
   There is a minister now preaching the Gospel, and God is greatly
   blessing him, who says he owes his earnestness to a remark I made in a
   certain College that I visited. I was asked, as we say, "on the spur of
   the moment," to speak a word to the students, and I said, "Well,
   Brothers, I have nothing to say to you except this--whenever you see
   the devil, have a shot at him." The young man told me that he
   remembered that sentence and it had often been of service to him. So I
   say it again to every Christian here--Whenever you see the devil, have
   a shot at him! If you see sin, rebuke it! If you see doubt, try to
   remove it! If you see darkness, bring the Light of God to bear upon
   it--and do it "straightway," for opportunities are flying and will soon
   be gone unless we seize them as they come near us!

   There is a lamentable story told of a man in a boat being carried down
   a waterfall and drowned and, an hour after, one who had been standing
   with others on the shore said, "I could have saved him if I had thought
   of it before." They asked him, "How would you have done it?" And he
   laid before them a perfectly feasible commonsense plan that might have
   been easily carried out and, I think, he went home very miserable, for
   all the spectators of the disaster seemed to say, "Why did you not
   think of it before? You are wise too late." So, when certain men have
   died, I think some of you must have known what it was to say, "Oh, I
   wish I had spoken to him! That Gospel which saved me might have been a
   blessing to him, but now he is gone and I have thought of the remedy
   too late!" Do not let it be possible to have such regrets, but,
   whenever you find an opportunity of speaking about salvation to others,
   do it "straightway."

   And, once again, let this word, "straightway," be your motto with
   regard to your own soul. Whenever you find your spiritual life
   declining, your faith growing weak and your love getting cold, go back
   to Jesus and ask for quicken-ing--and do it "straightway." Always nip
   these things in the bud! Most diseases must have the remedies applied
   at once if they are to be cured. If they are allowed to remain
   unchecked for a time, they gather strength to the great injury of the
   patient. The moment you feel that you have not the power in prayer that
   you once had, go "straightway" to Jesus! The instant you realize that
   you have not the love for souls that you once had, fly away to Jesus
   and tell Him all about your sad condition. Oh, if we always took heed
   to our backsliding as soon as it began, how much of sorrow and how much
   of sin might be spared! So, dear Friends, if I am describing your case,
   I implore you to renew your communion with your Lord--get back to
   Christ, ask for pardon at His hands--and do all this "straightway."

   Dear Christian Brothers and Sisters, this is the motto for you,
   "STRAIGHTWAY!" Let it flame like a lightning flash through the place!
   Whatever ought to be done, let it be done at once, without even a
   second thought. O Beloved, will you still delay in such a matter of
   urgency as this? Then let me further plead with you for a minute or two
   before I turn to the other part of my subject. Imagine the day of
   battle and a colonel issuing the order to his regiment to march into
   the midst of the fray. Do the men hesitate? Do they stand still? Then
   there is mutiny in the ranks! "Forward!" he said, but the troops stay
   where they are. They are disloyal. How can the battle be won by men who
   act like that? But see how the faithful soldiers in the army behave.
   The command is given, "Charge!" It matters not how many are their
   foes-- away they go like a whirlwind--who can stop them? Let it be so
   with you, dear Friends. Good soldiers of Jesus Christ must not
   hesitate, but must obey the Captain of their salvation "straightway."

   Have you a vivid imagination? Can you, in your mind's eye, picture an
   angel up yonder before the burning Throne of God? The voice of Jehovah
   has said to him, "Descend to earth." Can you imagine Gabriel staying
   there, with his finger on his lips, deliberating whether he shall fly
   or not? Do you not often ask that you may do God's will on earth as
   angels do it in Heaven? Then, how can you hesitate, even for an
   instant, to do what you are clearly commanded by Christ to do? Let me
   ask you another question--Did Christ delay His great mission of mercy?
   No, for it was with Him as good Dr. Watts sings--

   "Plunged in a gulf of dark despair

   We wretched sinners lay

   Without one cheerful beam of hope,

   Or spark of glimmering day.

   With pitying eyes, the Prince of Grace

   Beheld our helpless grief

   He saw, and oh, amazing love,

   He ran to our relief!

   Down from the shining seats above

   With joyful haste He fled,

   Entered the grave in mortal flesh,

   And dwelt among the dead." There was no hesitating in Christ! Then,
   shall there be any in you who are called by His name?

   Further, did God lose any time before He saved you when you cried to
   Him? Does He delay to bless you now? If there is a seeming delay, it is
   Infinite Wisdom that makes you wait, only that the blessing may be all
   the more valued by you when it comes! But He is always ready to bless
   you. He stands prepared to give you all that you need. I charge you,
   therefore, by all these reasons, take this word, "straightway," as your
   motto. You are, yourself, a dying man, and if you do not accomplish
   your life-work "straightway," when will you perform it? Others are
   dying all around you! If you are not made a blessing to them
   "straightway," when may you hope to do them good? If anything is right,
   do it at once--there cannot be a good reason for any delay! Why should
   you ask for second thoughts about a plain duty? In such a case, first
   thoughts are best, and those first thoughts should be followed by
   immediate and energetic action. "Straightway!" Write it on your
   banners! Let it wave in the breeze, for victory will be given to the
   Church of Christ when she advances to the fight with all her hosts
   "straightway!"

   II. Now I ask the prayers of all Believers while, during the rest of my
   discourse, I try to speak to those who are "out of the way." In this
   large congregation there must be many who are not saved. It is idle to
   suppose that we are, all of us, the children of God and the servants of
   Christ, for we are not. There are some here who are not saved--but
   among them there are, I hope, some who wish to be saved. Well, if you
   really desire to be Christians. If the Holy Spirit has made you start
   seeking the Savior, I ask you to put this word into your bosom and bear
   it home with you, "straightway," for IT IS

   A MOST SUITABLE MOTTO FOR ALL SEEKERS.

   Are you seeking the Lord? Again, I pray you, hear the Gospel
   "straightway." The Gospel is not preached everywhere. Some go to
   certain places of worship because the music is admirable. Others
   because the preacher is clever. Some because it is considered
   "respectable" to go to such a place. I charge you, if you have not
   found Christ, care for nothing but finding Him! And where will you find
   Him except where He is fully and faithfully preached? If He is the head
   and front of the minister's discourses, then go there--not where they
   preach the "modern gospel," which would not save a mouse--but where
   Christ on the Cross is lifted high as the one hope for the salvation of
   sinners! Go there, go at once, and make a habit of going where Christ
   Crucified is constantly proclaimed! Remember how the Lord gave the
   invitation to the heavenly feast even by the mouth of the Prophet
   Isaiah. "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that
   has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price. Why do you spend money for that which
   is not bread? And you labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken
   diligently unto Me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul
   delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto Me: hear, and
   your soul shall live; and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you,
   even the sure mercies of David."

   But when you are hearing the Gospel, be not content with merely
   hearing, but repent "straightway." You cannot have Christ and keep your
   sins, therefore, give up all evil at once! May God's blessed Spirit now
   separate you from your sins! Have you been inclined to drunkenness?
   Turn the intoxicating cup bottom upwards once and for all, and have
   done with it! What has been your particular besetting sin? Though it
   were dear as your right eye, pluck it out! Though it were precious as
   your right arm, cut it off and cast it from you! And do it
   "straightway." "Oh," you say, "I will see about it tomorrow!" Then, I
   know that God's Spirit is not effectually calling you, or you would be
   ready at once to turn from every false way, to Him, and then the time
   of your deliverance would have come. Therefore, I repeat--Repent
   "straightway." But then you must also pray "straightway." Plead with
   the Lord just where you are now in your seat, or, if you desire quiet
   and retirement, pray as soon as you reach your house--yes, pray in the
   street, on the road home! Lift up your heart to God and cry, "God be
   merciful to me a sinner!" But do it at once, or, as the text says,
   "straightway."

   Above all, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ ' 'straightway." That word,
   "straightway," is implied in every Gospel exhortation! We are not sent
   to preach to our Hearers, "'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ tomorrow!"
   No minister of Christ is authorized to say, "Put off faith in Christ
   for a week." No, but our message is, "Behold, nowis the accepted time!
   Behold, nowis the day of salvation!" Believe in Jesus and believe in
   Him now! And if the Spirit of God is really working in your spirit, you
   will be moved to believe now. If it is only my talk and my persuasion,
   you will still say, "Tomorrow." But if it is God's Word, it will go
   with power to your heart and you will say, "Now, Lord, even now, bring
   my soul out of prison, that I may trust Your Son and praise Your holy
   name." For a man to delay, who has nothing to depend upon but the
   breath in his nostrils, is the height of folly! For a man to delay, who
   stands on the brink of the grave, when that grave will conduct him to
   Hell, is indeed terrible!

   Delay is dangerous, but I confess that I do not understand men and
   their criminal carelessness. I daresay you read in the papers, a short
   time ago, about the destruction of the Swiss village of Elm. What an
   extraordinary affair it was, that the people should have had it
   reported to them, for months, that the forest which overhung the
   village was often seen to tremble when the rocks were blasted at the
   quarry. They knew that, sooner or later, the mountain above them would
   inevitably come down and crush them! Yet they went to church on the
   Sunday morning, and were gathered together as comfortably and quietly
   as if nothing alarming could ever happen to them. Many of you, no
   doubt, remember the story and, therefore, I need not tell you how, all
   of a sudden, the great forest above the village seemed to come down
   upon them--and when stalwart men from the upper end of the village
   hurried to help their fellow countrymen, they had scarcely arrived
   before the mountain, itself, descended in one tremendous mass and
   buried the whole village in a moment! The people knew that such a
   calamity as that would certainly happen--they had been warned of it
   again and again--yet they persisted in living there.

   I do not know how men could get so accustomed to impending danger as
   they did, and I must blame the foolhardi-ness of those who willfully
   ran such a risk of destruction. But it is nothing compared with the
   madness of man and women who see the great mountain of Divine Wrath
   trembling and about to fall upon them, to crush them to all eternity
   and yet they go on with their games and occupy themselves with their
   sports, just as if there were no God to judge them, no Heaven to be
   sought, no Hell to be shunned! They sin as if iniquity were mere
   child's play and there were no punishment for it in the world to come!
   Delay is dangerous at all times, but I feel moved to say that it is
   especially dangerous for some of you just now, for, as the Lord lives,
   unless you find salvation within another week, you will be in the world
   where it shall be impossible for you either to seek or to find it! If
   not saved soon, you will be lost forever. Delay is dangerous--
   therefore escape for your lives and escape at once!

   Besides, delay will be a great loss to you. If I were unsaved at this
   moment and in my right senses, I would wish to be saved here and now. I
   do not know what has been done with the two men who have been lying in
   prison for the last two years under what is believed to be a false
   accusation. We heard that the Home Secretary had fetched them up from
   Chatham to Pentonville to Millbank and that they were brought up in
   their own clothes, with a view to setting them free tomorrow, but I
   guarantee you, if I had been in their position and had been asked,
   "Would you prefer to be set at liberty on Saturday, or wait till
   Monday?" I would have said, "Oh, set me free at once, straightway!" Any
   delay would be to my loss. Who wants to stay in prison on a Sunday when
   he can walk at large? Who wishes to be there five minutes longer than
   he is compelled to be? And, in like manner, who would be unconverted
   five minutes longer than he needs to be? It is a loss to a man to be
   unsaved--even if he is ultimately saved, all the time that went before
   his conversion is just so long spent in prison--it is dead time, lost
   time! Therefore, let there be no delay in trusting Christ, for all
   delay is a loss.

   And, besides, delay makes it more difficult to get into the way of
   life. A person, on a certain line of railway, wants to go North, but he
   gets into the wrong train and, therefore, travels South. After he has
   gone a little way, he puts his head out and says, "This is not the
   station that I ought to pass!" And, as the porters cry out a name
   altogether different from what he expected to hear, he exclaims, "Why,
   I am on the wrong train!" What does he do then? Go on and say, "Well, I
   will get out by-and-by"? Not he! If he is a man of business and needs
   to keep an appointment, he jumps out at the first station after he
   discovers his mistake, and he says, "Tell me, please, when is there a
   train back? I have evidently come South instead of going North, and I
   need to return as quickly as possible." My dear Friends, some of you
   are traveling on the wrong line and you have come to a station,
   tonight! It is not a station where you ought to be. Do not, I entreat
   you, go on to another in the same direction, but I pray God, by His
   Grace, that you may get out of the train in which you have been
   traveling on the down line, and say, "Which is the train for Heaven? I
   must get into it somewhere--first class, second class, third class, or
   in the goods wagon--I do not care where I am, as long as I do but get
   in, for I have made a mistake, and I would not continue to make it--for
   the longer I remain as I am, the more difficult will it be for me to
   get right."

   Do you not also know, dear Friends, that every moment in which a man
   delays he is committing more sin? When I am not doing that which is
   right, I sin by omission. When a man neglects a duty for a week, how
   many times does he sin? "Once," you answer. Ah, no! It is his duty to
   do it now, but he has not done it, so that is sin. It will be equally
   his duty in five minutes' time, and every moment he puts it off, he
   keeps on committing sin upon sin! The longer he delays, he continues to
   sin. Have you ever heard the legend of one who had often delayed his
   repentance till he was taken into a forest where he saw an old man
   chopping sticks for his fire. He cut away till he had enough to make a
   large pile of firewood and then he tied the firewood up and stooped to
   put it on his shoulders, but it was too heavy for him to lift. The old
   man sighed, took his axe and cut down some more branches and added them
   to his bundle. But when he tried to take it up, of course it was still
   heavier than before! So the foolish old man, with many a sigh, went on
   cutting more wood and put that on the heap, and then tried to lift it,
   but of course it was heavier still! And the longer he delayed, the
   heavier the burden became. That is just your case, dear Friend, if you
   are delaying to repent--

   "Longer wisdom you despise, Harder is she to be won."

   There is all the more sin to be repented of, there is the more hardness
   of heart to be overcome, so you are adding to the difficulty every
   moment that you delay! "Grandfather," said a little child, "the
   preacher talked about loving Jesus. Do you love Him?" "No, child," said
   the old man. "I have never thought of those things, but I hope that you
   will while your heart is tender." "But, Grandfather, you will die soon.
   Please, won't you love Jesus?" "No, child," replied the old man, "my
   heart is too hard, now. It is no use for me to think about it." Many a
   man has said that! It is a great mistake, for the Lord can soften the
   hardest heart and bring the oldest man or woman to Himself. Still,
   there is great force in the grandfather's words and it is a blessed
   thing when we begin to serve the Lord early, for there is a hardening
   process that goes on every hour of delay, which I pray God, of His
   Infinite Mercy, to prevent by bringing every one of you to Jesus Christ
   "straightway."

   Shall I tell you one thing more before I finish? It is this--whenever a
   man will not have Christ "straightway." Whenever he will not give up
   his sin "straightway." Whenever he will not believe in Jesus
   "straightway," that is a roundabout method of saying, "No," to Christ!
   The father in the parable said to the son, "Go, work today in my
   vineyard," and he replied, "I go, Sir." That is to say, "I am going,
   Sir. I mean to go. Give me just a little time to think it over. It is
   all right, Sir, I will go." But how does the parable put it? "He said,
   I go, Sir, and went not." It was an indirect way of saying that, after
   all, he did not mean to go. Alas, that is what I fear some of you will
   do tonight. You will say, "Yes, what the preacher says is quite
   correct. We should seek Christ and plead for mercy--and we will do
   so--by-and-by. Soon--not immediately. Of course we cannot be in a hurry
   about these things, but we will attend to them some day." I tell you,
   Sirs, plainly, that you will not! You are the sort of people who will
   not come to Christ! You have not the moral courage to say, "No," but
   you mean, "No," all the while! And if you said, "No," I would have more
   hope of you, for the rest of the parable runs thus--"He said to the
   other son, Go, work today in my vineyard. And he said, I will not."
   That was pretty plain. "But afterwards he repented, and went." Now, I
   would rather have you say, "I will not," and then afterwards go home
   and repent and come to Christ, than I would have you beat about the
   bush and say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes," thinking that you are complimenting
   Christ with your lying--I dare not use a milder term! That "yes, yes,
   yes," means that you will not!

   Have you never noticed, when you have been collecting subscriptions, if
   you go to a person who does not say, "No," straight out, but says,
   "Well, let me look at your list--yes, what is the objective of it?"
   that he usually adds, "I have many calls. I will think about it"? I
   have known such people, "think about it," a very long while, but
   nothing ever came of all their thinking! You smile at what people do
   with regard to a subscription list--and it is, in some respects, a
   thing to smile over. But beware lest you do the same with your soul! Do
   not, I pray you, act like that towards the Lord Jesus Christ! Do not
   merely think about it, but doit! Go straight to Him and think of it
   afterwards--and you will then have to think, with joy--and delight,
   that the best day's work His Grace ever enabled you to do was this
   getting away to Christ and casting yourself on Him!

   God bless you, dear Friends! May we all meet in Heaven, through Jesus
   Christ our Lord! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW25:1-13.

   Verses 1, 2. Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
   virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
   And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. What a division this
   makes in the visible Church of God! Let us hope that we are not to
   gather from this that as many as half the professors of Christianity at
   any time are like these foolish virgins! Yet our Lord would not have
   mentioned so high a proportion if there were not a very large mixture
   of foolish with the wise--"Five of them were wise, and five were
   foolish."

   3. They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them.
   They thought that if they had the external, it would be quite enough.
   The secret store of oil they judged to be unnecessary because it would
   be unseen. They would employ one hand in carrying the lamp, but to
   occupy the other hand by holding the oil-flask seemed to them to be
   doing too much--giving themselves up too thoroughly to the work--so
   they "took their lamps, and took no oil with them." They might just as
   well have had no lamps at all!

   4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Oil in
   their lamps and oil with their lamps. Lamps are of no use without oil,
   yet the oil needs the lamp, or else it cannot be rightly used. The
   light of profession cannot be truly sustained without the oil of Grace.
   Grace, wherever it exists, ought to show itself, as the oil is made to
   burn by means of the lamp, but it is no use to attempt to make a show
   unless there is that secret store somewhere by which the external part
   of religion may be maintained.

   5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept Both the
   wise and the foolish fell into a state which seemed alike in them both.
   In the case of good men, Christ's delaying His coming often causes
   disappointment, weariness and then lethargy. And even the true Church
   falls into a deep slumber. In the foolish--the mere professors--this
   condition goes much further. There being in them no true life, the very
   name to live becomes abandoned and, before long they give up even the
   profession of religion when there is no secret oil of Grace to sustain
   it.

   6. And at midnight when things had come to the worst "At midnight"--the
   coldest and darkest hour, when everybody was asleep.

   6. There was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to
   meet him. That was a cry which startled everybody! None of the virgins
   could sleep when once it was announced that the bridegroom was coming.
   I wish, dear Friends, that we thought more of the great Truth of the
   Second Advent. The more often it is preached in due proportion with
   other Truths of God, the better. We still need to hear that midnight
   cry, "Go you out to meet Him."

   7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. They could
   not sleep any longer. They were fairly startled and awakened.

   8. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us some of your oil Ah, me!
   Now they began to value what they had, before, despised! They were
   foolish enough to think that oil was unnecessary, but now they saw that
   it was the one essential thing, so they cried to the wise virgins,
   "Give us some of your oil." And hear the dreadful reason--

   8. For our lamps are gone out I do not know any more terrible words
   than those, "Our lamps are gone out." It is worse to have a lamp that
   has gone out than never to have had a lamp at all. "'Our lamps are gone
   out.' We once rejoiced in them. We promised ourselves a bright future.
   We said, 'All is well for the marriage supper.' But 'our lamps are gone
   out,' and we have no oil with which to replenish them." O Sirs, may
   none of us ever have to lift up that mournful cry! On a dying bed, in
   the extremity of pain, in the depth of human weakness it is an awful
   thing to find one's profession burning low, one's hope of Heaven going
   out like the snuff of a candle!

   9. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for
   us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for
   yourselves. It is no easy matter to go and wake up the seller of oil
   when the midnight hour has struck. O you who are putting off repentance
   to a dying bed, you are foolish virgins, indeed! Your folly has reached
   the utmost height! You will have more than enough to do when you lie
   there with the death-sweat cold upon your brow, without then having to
   seek the Grace which you are neglecting to obtain today, but which you
   will value then!

   10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While they were
   not there.

   10, 11. And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and
   the door was shut Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord,
   Lord, open to us. Too late! So that they could not enter.

   12. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not' 'I
   never knew you," says Christ in another place, and this knowledge of
   His is always bound up with affection. He loves no heart that He knows
   not in this sense. Those whom He knows, He loves. Will He ever say to
   me or to you, dear Friend, "I know you not"? God grant that He never
   may have cause to do so!

   13. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein
   the Son ofMan comes

The Captain of Our Salvation

   (No. 2619)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 23, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   19, 1882.

   "For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings." Hebrews 2:10.

   OBSERVE, dear Friends, how glorious God is. The description given here
   by the Apostle contains but few words, and those nearly all little
   ones, but how full of meaning they are! "Him, for whom are all things,
   and by whom are all things." Here you have God set forth as being both
   the beginning and the end of everything! All things are frHim--to do
   His bidding, to accomplish His purpose, to act forth His Glory and this
   because all things are byHim--in their first creation, in their
   subsequent preservation and in all that is yet to come of them! Of whom
   speaks the Apostle this but of the Triune God, to whom be glory forever
   and ever? Of whom speaks He this--if we would be still more exact--but
   of the Father who has made His Son perfect in bringing many sons to
   Glory? It is the Father "for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things."

   And, my dear Brothers and Sisters, the Apostle was wisely guided by the
   Holy Spirit to give this title to the Father in this particular place.
   Sometimes, in prayer, men call God by one or another of His names and
   each name may be correct, yet it may not be well chosen for that
   special occasion. But you will notice that if the Holy Spirit describes
   either God the Father or the Lord Jesus by any term other than His
   usual name, the title is always very wisely chosen and is most
   appropriate in that place. Now, in the matter of our salvation, we need
   One, "by whom are all things," for none but the Creator can create us
   anew in Christ Jesus. No one who has less power than the Divine
   Preserver of men can keep us from falling. And none but the Divine
   Being who encompasses all things within the range of His Infinite mind,
   can guard us against the many terrible perils on the way to Heaven. If
   ever we are to be brought to Glory, it must be by the God "by whom are
   all things." And certainly, if we are brought there, as I pray that we
   all may be--it will be by Him "for whom are all things"--and we shall
   forever adore the mystery of His Grace which landed us safely on the
   heavenly shore!

   Every part of the great plan of salvation sets forth the splendor of
   the Grace of the Most High God. What do we see in our election but His
   Grace? What do we see in our redemption but His Grace? What do we see
   in our conversion but His Grace? What do we see in our justification,
   sanctification, adoption and final preservation but His Grace? By Him,
   in Grace as well as in Nature, are all things--and for Him, in Grace as
   well as in Nature, are all things. Unto Him belongs both the power and
   the glory, the two must always go together. He works all our works in
   us and to Him be all the praise, world without end!

   We start, then, with this as a sort of keynote--that the great Father,
   who has purposed our salvation, is able to fully carry out what He has
   planned, for by Him are all things. And He also has an admirable reason
   for accomplishing it, because it will bring Him glory, and for Him are
   all things. If our salvation would degrade His name in any sense or
   respect. If the salvation of sinners would even obscure the severity of
   His justice, it might be a question as to whether it would ever be
   accomplished. But, since there is nothing about this work but what will
   bring Him honor and glory, we rest assured that, having put His hand to
   it, He will not withdraw His arm until He has fully accomplished His
   eternal purpose to the praise of the glory of His Grace!

   Our text sets before us some most precious Truth concerning our Lord
   Jesus Christ and His people. First, here is a high enterprise--the
   bringing of many sons to Glory. In the second place, this enterprise is
   being carried out by an ordained Captain--there is a Captain of our
   salvation through whom the many sons are to be brought to Glory. And,
   thirdly, we are to notice the becoming work of the Father upon Him who
   is Captain. "For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom
   are all things, in bringing many sons to Glory, to make the Captain of
   their salvation perfect through sufferings."

   I. First, then, here IS A HIGH ENTERPRISE--the bringing of many sons to
   Glory.

   I think that you will find the historical parallel of this enterprise
   in the Lord's great work of bringing the tribes of Israel out of Egypt,
   through the Red Sea, through the wilderness and into Canaan. The Lord,
   in His deliverance of His ancient people, gives us a type of what He is
   doing and will do for all His chosen. The exodus was not merely the
   bringing of the people out of Egypt into the wilderness, for then they
   might truly have said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   have you taken us away to die in the wilderness?" But the whole
   transaction was not completed, the enterprise was not finished, until
   all those whom the Lord intended to bless had actually crossed the
   Jordan and had taken possession of the promised land. He led not the
   children of Israel merely out of Egypt, but He led them into Canaan--
   and His leadership of them through the desert is a picture and emblem
   of Christ's leadership of the many sons whom He is bringing to Glory. I
   want you to think of the salvation of the redeemed in that light.

   To begin at the end, the Lord Jesus is bringing many sons to Glory,
   just as God brought His ancient people into Canaan. The ultimate
   destination of every Believer is eternal Glory. There is not one of us
   who will be perfect and complete until we stand at the right hand of
   God, even the Father. There is no secondary position where some of the
   redeemed may be satisfied to remain, but the many sons are all to be
   brought to "Glory." That is the word--one of the biggest words that can
   be spoken by any mortal mouth. Do you know all its meaning? No, my
   Brothers and Sisters, you do not, and there is another word that comes
   before it--"The Lord will give Grace and Glory." Do you know all the
   meanings, even, of, "Grace"? No, you do not--yet you have tasted of
   God's Grace and if you know not all the meaning of that of which you
   daily partake, I am sure you do not know the meaning of that, "Glory,"
   which you have not yet obtained.

   Heaven is rightly called, "Glory." I do not doubt that it is a very
   glorious place. People have written books in which they have sought to
   give us some idea of Heaven as perfecting all the joys of our earthly
   domestic life. And artists have tried to depict the plains of Heaven,
   but the books and the works of art are equally worthy to be burnt, for
   they fall so infinitely short of what the reality must be that they are
   only a caricature and a mockery of what "Glory" must really be. No,
   Beloved, no tongue can tell what it is, and no pencil can depict the
   Glory of the place, itself, the Father's House, where the many mansions
   are--

   "Eye has not seen it, my gentle boy-- Ear has not heard its sweet songs
   of joy!"

   Nor shall your imagination be able to bring these things down to you,
   for there is a spiritual Glory which must far exceed all the glories of
   which you know anything on earth!

   I think, also, that Heaven is called, "Glory," because its inhabitants
   follow glorious pursuits. What they are doing there all day long, I
   shall not attempt to guess, but we are told that "the Throne of God and
   of the Lamb shall be in it and His servants shall serve Him. They shall
   see His face and His name shall be on their foreheads." They will have
   enough to do to cast their crowns at His dear feet who gave them all
   the joy they have--and to make known to principalities and powers in
   heavenly places the manifold wisdom of God! Of this we are quite
   sure--all their pursuits will be glorious, there will be nothing low,
   nothing groveling, nothing selfish done in Heaven--certainly, nothing
   wearisome, nothing laborious that can bring sweat to the brow, again,
   that comes here because of the Curse. No, it is a glorious place where
   the happy dwellers are engaged in glorious pursuits!

   And they also have glorious pleasures. They realize to the fullest what
   David said, "In Your Presence is fullness of joy. At Your right hand
   there are pleasures forevermore." Did you ever think--have you the
   power to conceive--what the pleasures of God must be? What is the joy
   of the Lord--the infinite satisfaction of the Eternal--the profound
   bliss of Him who is most blessed forever? It is that joy, that bliss,
   that peace of which they shall have a share, as the Master says to each
   one of them, "Enter you into the joy of your Lord." As high as the
   heavens are above the earth, so high is God's joy above our joy.
   Therefore we cannot attempt to describe it, but we can only say of it
   that the joy of Heaven is Glory! The bliss of Heaven is "from Glory to
   Glory" forever and ever!

   And, as Heaven is a glorious place for glorious pursuits and glorious
   pleasures, so all there will be glorious persons. There is not one low
   or mean inhabitant of Heaven! There are many there who were despised on
   earth--the lowly and the suffering and the persecuted--but they are no
   longer despised. God has put eternal honor upon them. They are all
   priests and kings unto God! The priestly garments they wear are more
   grand than Aaron's raiment of glory and beauty and in their royal robes
   they keep high holiday, where the sun goes down no more, and the days
   of their mourning are forever ended. It is all glorious and I do not
   wonder that Heaven is called, "Glory," and that we have so little said
   about it. There is just this great word--"Glory"--which by itself says
   more than I would be able to say if I kept you here till the clock
   tolled out the midnight hour!

   This is the high enterprise of God, to bring His many sons to Glory. I
   call it a high enterprise, and so it is, for He will bring them to
   Glory despite all difficulties. Where do the redeemed begin their
   march? Down there, at the iron furnace, where they have lain among the
   pots, and where their slavery has been hard and cruel. Their march
   begins with Pharaoh to oppose them, but, with a high hand and an
   outstretched arm, God brings them up out of the bondage of Nature, and
   out of the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the
   children of God! How gloriously does He lead them through the Red Sea
   and destroy their adversaries with the precious blood of Jesus, till
   the depths have covered them, and there is not one of them left! And
   the rest of the passage of His people, from that high day at the Red
   Sea onward till they reach Glory--what is it but a march of miracles,
   an ever-moving panorama of wonders? I do but speak of the experience of
   the true Christian when I say that he is opposed from within and from
   without and that he is his own greatest enemy--and that is not saying a
   small thing when I remind you that the world, the flesh and the devil
   are all leagued against him!

   It is with push of pike that I make my way to Heaven, disputing with my
   fierce foe every inch of the road. Yet I shall win the day, for He, "by
   whom are all things," has undertaken to lead His sons to Glory--and He
   willead them there! If they had to cut their way through a whole legion
   of devils, as when men reap their path through a thick cornfield, yet
   should they, everyone of them, pass through unharmed! If there were
   seven thousand Hells between them and Heaven, yet they would reach it
   in safety because He, "for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things," has determined to bring them there! Yet it is no easy march
   and it will be no little glory that shall redound to Him who will lead
   us all through the wilderness and bring us to the Canaan which is
   above, that is, to "Glory."

   I want you to notice, next, that this high enterprise on God's part is
   concerning the bringing of "many sons to Glory." In the second part of
   The Pilgrim's Progress, we read about Mr. Great-Heart, who had a tough
   task to lead those women and children all the way to the Celestial
   City. They caused him a deal of trouble and he is a picture of many a
   Christian minister. Some of us have not to go before a few
   faint-hearted pilgrims, but we have to lead hundreds, or even
   thousands! Every morning before breakfast, I have to kill a giant for
   somebody or other, and hard fighting it is! And as soon as ever I have
   killed him, I hear one of the dear children crying out that he is going
   to be eaten up alive by another, so that I have to keep my sword always
   drawn! It is no easy task to be, under Christ, helping to bring some of
   these sons to Glory!

   But think of the work that God has undertaken--to bring many sons to
   Glory--untold millions of them! I shall not attempt to use figures to
   represent the numbers of the saved, for I believe my Master's redeemed
   ones will be as the dew of the morning, as the drops of the spray, as
   the sands on the seashore and far excelling the starry hosts marshaled
   on the midnight plains. Many sons will be brought to Glory by the great
   Father. Sometimes, in the old days of war, there used to be a number of
   little ships wanting to cross the sea, but the privateers were on the
   watch, so the seamen were afraid to hoist the sail and get away from
   the shelter of the shore, for they would soon be caught by their
   enemies, like doves by the hawk. Well, what was done? There they lay,
   in port, until His Majesty sent down a man-of-war, perhaps two or
   three, to be a convoy. Then the little ships would all be safe--their
   crews need not any longer be afraid of the Frenchmen or the Spaniards.
   So is it with those who are under the protection of God. We, weak
   little vessels, could never, by ourselves, reach our desired haven,
   but, lo, the Lord High Admiral of the seas and the great Emperor of the
   land has come forth in the majesty of His power to conduct us to Glory!
   And we shall get there safely, even though our enemies should be beyond
   all count. It was a grand thing when those convoys brought many little
   ships into harbor, but what a fleet the Lord will bring into the Fair
   Havens of eternal happiness! We read that on one occasion, when the
   Lord Jesus was crossing the Sea of Galilee, "there were also with Him
   other little ships." And there are still with Him many other little
   ships, but He will bring them all safely into the harbor. Let the enemy
   attack them if he dares to do so, but their Protector will preserve
   them all, for it is His purpose to bring many sons to Glory.

   I have not yet said all I need to say about this high enterprise, for
   perhaps the chief wonder of it all is that He, "for whom are all
   things, and by whom are all things," has resolved to bring to Glory
   many sons. They shall, all of them, be His sons! Oh, what a marvel it
   is that they should be His sons! Who will have them for sons? I am sure
   that there is many a man who might be ashamed to take for sons those
   whom God takes--the most depraved, debased and fallen--whom men have
   passed by, as those to whom they could not even speak. The Lord, in
   Infinite Love, has taken them to be His children and He has said of
   them, "I will be a Father to them, and they shall be My sons and
   daughters." But, oh, what a work is needed in order to turn these
   rebels into children! What a wonder of Grace it is that they should
   first be regenerated and so get the nature of children! And then that
   they should be adopted and so have the status of children! And then
   that they should be sanctified and so exhibit, from day to day, those
   qualities that must be found in the children of a holy God! To make
   them sons is, indeed, an amazing work!

   God did not do as much as that for the people in the wilderness. In
   that respect, the type broke down, for the Israelites would not be
   God's sons. He acted as a father towards them, but they were rebels
   against Him and, therefore, the carcasses of that first generation fell
   in the wilderness. What a mercy it is that God does not now write the
   Law on tablets of stone, but on the fleshy tablets of our hearts! And
   the Law of God being written there, He gives us the Grace to obey it
   and, especially, He gives us Grace to believe in Jesus and to receive
   Him! John wrote, "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to
   become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name." And it
   is still true of all who receive Him and believe on His name! Oh, what
   a mercy it is that guilty sinners may so receive the adoption of
   children! What a blessed thing it is that God will not only bring us to
   Glory, but that we shall be sons when He gets us there! He will bring
   us to Glory as sons--we shall be His sons while on the road and we
   shall be acknowledged as His sons in the presence of the entire
   universe in that day when the righteous shall "shine forth as the sun
   in the Kingdom of their Father," for that is the glorious Kingdom to
   which He is going to bring us!

   Blessed be His name that He should ever make us sons and resolve to
   bring us to Glory! Ah, well, He has set His heart upon doing it and He
   can do it--therefore let us again bless and praise His holy name!

   II. Now I turn to my second point, which is concerning THE ORDAINED
   CAPTAIN. God intends to bring "many sons to Glory," but He means to do
   it by the hand of a chosen Captain, greater than Joshua, who will fight
   for His people and conduct them safely into the Canaan of "Glory."

   The word here translated, "Captain," is, in another place, rendered,
   "Author," and, in yet another passage, "Prince." In fact, it is twice
   translated, "Prince." But I feel perfectly satisfied to take the term
   as our Authorized Version gives it and to say that the Lord our God
   leads His people to Glory by a Captain. He might have done it, if so it
   had pleased Him, by His own power and might, apart from a Mediator, but
   He has not done so. He has ordained everything by the hand of a
   Mediator and it is an essential part of His arrangement of the whole
   system of Grace that the Father should work by the Son to bring the
   many sons to Glory, that the Son should bring them there by being the
   Captain in their midst, representing Him among men, being clothed with
   His power, effecting His Divine purpose for them. God will bring no
   sons to Glory except through this Captain! None may ever hope to enter
   Glory except by Christ Jesus! He Himself has said, "I am the way." And
   He is the only way. Therefore, woe be to those who refuse to come to
   God by Him! God will bring all His sons to Glory, but it must be by the
   Captain whom He has ordained. Let us think for a little while what a
   captain is and what a captain has to do, for that will help us to
   understand the office and work of the Captain of our salvation.

   First, then, the Lord Jesus Christ has come to conduct us to Glory by
   making all arrangements for the march. There is a great deal of
   responsibility connected with the leader of an army, not only in
   deciding as to where his troops shall encamp for the night, but where
   they shall march on the morrow, and in what direction they will be
   likely to be needed many days ahead. The commissariat of an army
   requires great thoughtfulness and care on the part of the leader and
   our Captain, the Lord Jesus Christ, has made all necessary arrangements
   for His people between here and Heaven! I am quite sure that we shall
   never come to a halting place between here and Glory, of which we shall
   be able to say that no provision has been made for us there.
   Providence, or seeing beforehand, is always at work on behalf of the
   Lord's people. God is always looking ahead and Christ makes every
   arrangement for the salvation of all His people, even down to the
   minutest details. He is a most blessed Captain.

   A captain's work, after he has arranged for the march, is, next, to
   give thee word of command. "Go," he says, or, "Stay." "Do this," or,
   "Be still." The soldier's one business is to obey his orders. He has
   not any right to choose what he will do. His marching orders are to be
   his law. Now, the Lord Jesus Christ will lead many sons to the Glory of
   His Father by giving those gracious commands which always bring a
   blessing with them whenever they are obeyed.

   Captains, however, do more than command, for, if they are wise, they
   lead the way. I have heard that a Turkish officer says to his men, "Go
   along," and stays behind and watches the soldiers. But when a British
   officer cries, "Come on!" he leads the way! That is what our Lord has
   done. In the sternest fight, He is always conspicuous, and there is no
   weary march that He bids us tramp in which He does not foot it at our
   side. You shall never climb so high that you will not find the
   footprint of the Crucified there, nor shall you be called to descend
   even into the depths of the sea but you shall find that He has been
   there, too, for He leads us always as the Captain of our salvation!

   It is a captain's business, also, to encourage his men. How often the
   presence of a true leader has effected more for the army than all their
   own strength could do! When Basing could not be taken by the
   Parliamentary troops in Cromwell's day, "Old Noll" went down and he
   took Basing, directly, as he did every other place that he determined
   to capture! And infinitely more glorious is the Captain of our
   salvation, whose Presence secures victory to the most discouraged band
   if they do but see Him, and say, "It is He!" The next word is, "Be not
   afraid," for where He comes, devils fly. The earth shakes at the
   Presence of the Christ of God! It is the captain's business to
   encourage his men, and that our great Captain does continually!

   Sometimes it is the captain's delight to reward his followers. A wise
   leader gives words of praise when they are deserved and, on special
   occasions, he distributes more substantial things. As for our blessed
   Lord, His gracious commendation, "Well done, good and faithful
   servant," would more than repay us for the toils of a lifetime--even if
   our lifetime were longer than Methuselah's! Let us, then, be faithful
   and true as we have such a Captain as our Lord Jesus Christ who can do
   for us all that captains should do for their soldiers, and a great deal
   more.

   Now, seeing that it is the will of the Lord to lead us to Glory by the
   Captain of our salvation, I want you to be worthy of your Leader. Do
   you not think that, sometimes, we act as if we had no Captain? We fancy
   that we have to fight our way to Heaven by the might of our own right
   hand and by our own skill, but it is not so. If you start before your
   Captain gives you the order to march, you will have to come back. And
   if you try to fight without your Captain, you will rue the day. "Oh,"
   says one, "but I have been thinking today what I shall do if
   such-and-such happens." My dear Brother, it would be a great deal
   better for you to remember that "the Lord lives," and to leave the
   thinking and arranging in His hands. There are a great many ifs in the
   world that are like a swarm of wasps--if you let those ifs out, they
   will sting you from head to foot! But there is one glorious if that
   will kill them all! It is this--if the Lord Jesus Christ could fail--if
   He could desert us, then all would be lost! That kills all the other
   ifs, because it is an impossible if. He cannot fail us or leave us! He
   must live, He must conquer and while that is the case, the other ifs do
   not mean anything to us. Therefore, cast yourselves on your Captain's
   care. March onward though you cannot see your way! Fly at the enemy
   though they seem to outnumber you by ten to one, for greater is He that
   is for you than all that can be against you! Be not afraid of anything,
   for your Captain is equal to all emergencies.

   When the Lord our God chose Him as our Leader and Commander, He laid
   help upon One that was mighty. He did not take some poor weak mortal to
   be the captain of such a company as we are! He did not even select an
   angel for this great task. He exalted One chosen out of the people who
   was most suitable for the position--and God's wisdom would be
   dishonored if Christ were found incapable of bringing the many sons to
   Glory! But He is blessedly capable of all that is required of Him--and
   the ancient prophecies concerning Him shall be completely fulfilled!
   "He shall not fail nor be discouraged." "and the pleasure of the Lord
   shall prosper in His hands."

   III. Thus far, then, we have seen that the Great Father will bring His
   many sons to Glory by a Captain. But the meat of the text lies in the
   part we have now to consider, and that is, THE BECOMING WORK OF THE
   FATHER UPON OUR CAPTAIN. "It became Him, in bringing many sons to
   Glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through
   sufferings."

   God always acts becomingly and, therefore, it was right that Christ
   should suffer. I have sometimes heard discussions as to whether the
   Lord might not have saved sinners without a Mediator, or, if through a
   Mediator, whether we might not have been saved by some other method
   without the death of Christ. I do not think it is right for us to form
   any kind of judgment upon that matter, but to say, as our risen Lord
   said to His disciples, "It behooved Christ to suffer." It was becoming
   that Christ should die. "It pleased the Lord to bruise Him." It was a
   seemly and proper thing, in the sight of Him, "for whom are all things,
   and by whom are all things," that we should be saved by a Mediator, and
   that the chosen Mediator should not have us apart from His own terrible
   sufferings.

   It was becoming that our Captain should be made perfect, complete,
   fully equipped for saving us by suffering. The agony could not be left
   out. The cup must not pass from Him without His drinking its awful
   contents. It was becoming that Christ should be poor--so He had not
   where to lay His head. It was becoming that He should be hungry--so He
   fasted for 40 days. It was becoming that He should sweat great drops of
   blood. It was a becoming thing in the sight of God that there should be
   suffering on the part of His chosen Captain. It was becoming that He
   should be spit upon-- that He should be mocked--that He should be
   scourged--that He should be nailed to a tree--that He should be parched
   with fever and, in awful depression of spirit, should cry, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" It was becoming that all this should
   happen and, therefore, it did happen. Let that be a sufficient answer
   to us whenever we are asked any questions about Christ's suffering--it
   was becoming in God's sight.

   And let those who deny the Atonement, and those precious critics who
   sneer at every hymn that tells of the agonies of Christ, understand
   that it was becoming that He should endure all this and that we are not
   ashamed to sing of what God counts becoming. I, for one, mean still to
   sing--

   "His dying crimson, like a robe, Spreads o'er His body on the tree."

   I mean, still, to sing--

   "Well might the sun in darkness hide, And shut its glories in, When
   God, the mighty Maker, died For man, the creature's sin."

   Even though it seems to some as if we knew Christ after the flesh, I
   would rather know Him so than not at all. And some seem to wish not to
   know Him at all. They want, especially, to get rid of the blood--"the
   offense of the Cross" has not yet ceased--it is still a cause of
   stumbling to a great many! But, oh, I pray you who are offended at the
   Cross, not to think that you will ever get to Heaven, for God and you
   would not agree, there, for He counts the Cross becoming, and you count
   it foolishness--so there is a radical difference of opinion between you
   two and one Heaven would not hold you! You must get agreed with God
   about that matter, or else, depend upon it, you will never enter the
   pearly gates! You must honor the Son even as you honor the Father, and
   honor the Son in His blood and wounds and in all His agony and death,
   or else you shall not come where the Father takes pleasure in the
   Well-Beloved.

   Further, the text seems to say that it was becoming that Christ should
   be made perfect through suffering. There are many points in which
   Christ could not save us without suffering. He could not be a perfect
   Substitute unless He bore our sin and shame. He could not be a perfect
   Sympathizer unless He bore our suffering. This, perhaps, is the main
   point in which Christ is perfected. He becomes capable of entering into
   all the griefs that disturb the many sons whom He is to lead to Glory.
   In our Elder Brother, the heir of all things, there is an epitome of
   all the sorrows of all the rest of the family. In Christ there is every
   pang that rends the heart, every grief that forces tears from the
   eyes--except such griefs as are sinful and could not enter into His
   holy bosom--but everything that is inevitable to flesh and blood, to
   hearts that break, spirits that are depressed and everything of that
   kind, Jesus knows.

   Sometimes I have been where none of you have ever been, but I have
   never been where I could not find Christ. And some of you, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters, have been in heartbreaking trouble that I never
   knew. But the Master has been there, if the Pastor has not, and if the
   dearest Christian friend has not--and so He has become perfect through
   suffering. "I know their sorrows," He says, "I know their sorrows, not
   by having read or heard about them, but by having suffered them." Of
   all the bitter medicine in the great apothecary's store, Christ has had
   a draught. He knows all about them and this makes Him "perfect through
   sufferings."

   Finally, it was becoming on the part of God, "for whom are all things,
   and by whom are all things," that He should perfect His Son as our
   Captain through sufferings. But the original Greek gives us a fuller
   meaning than this--that God should glorify His Son. It is becoming on
   God's part that He should give to Christ everything that can make Him
   glorious and honorable. Seeing that He bowed His head to suffer and to
   die, it was right that God should raise Him from the dead, that He
   should set Him at His own right hand, that He should crown Him with
   many crowns, that He should grant Him to "have dominion from sea to
   sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth." It is becoming that
   Christ should have all honor and Glory paid to Him, that men should
   honor the Son even as they honor the Father. In prayer, when I need an
   argument that I know will prevail with God, I say to Him, "Father,
   glorify Your Son! You love Him, look at Him, is He not lovely in Your
   eyes as the suffering, obedient Son of Your love? Do You not admire Him
   beyond all conception? Therefore, hear my supplication and grant my
   petition for His sake."

   I like, sometimes, to leave off praying and singing, and to sit still,
   and just gaze upward till my inmost soul has seen my Lord. Then I say,
   "He is inexpressibly lovely. Yes, He is altogether lovely!" If He is
   that to my poor eyes, which are so dull and dim that they cannot half
   discern His beauties, what must He be in the eyes of God? In the eyes
   of God He is so precious that, as my text says, "It became Him, for
   whom are all things, and by whom are all things"--it was becoming even
   in Him, "in bringing many sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings"-- glorified beyond all imaginable
   glory and to have universal homage paid to Him throughout the universe
   forever and ever! God sees it to be becoming and, therefore, we delight
   in it. Amen and amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 2:1-15.

   Verse 1. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
   which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. We have
   heard them. Do not let us forget them! Let them not be like the
   driftwood which goes floating down the stream. Let us make a desperate
   effort to retain them in our memories and, above all, to ponder them in
   our hearts.

   2. 3. For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every
   transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
   how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? They could not
   trifle with the angels' message without receiving just punishment from
   God. Much less, then, can we trifle with Christ's Gospel! We have not
   an angelic savior, but God Himself, in the Person of His Son, has
   deigned to be the Mediator of the New Covenant. Therefore, let us see
   to it that we do not trifle with these things. You see, dear Friends,
   that we need not be great open sinners in order to perish--it is merely
   a matter of neglect. See how it is put here. "How shall we escape, if
   we neglectso great a salvation?" You need not go to the trouble of
   despising it, or resisting it, or opposing it. You can be lost readily
   enough simply by neglecting it. In fact, the great mass of those who
   perish are those who neglect the great salvation!

   3. Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
   unto me by them that heard Him. The Apostles and the other followers of
   our Lord constantly bore witness to His miracles and His Resurrection.

   4. God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own
   will. Those who doubt the Truth of the Gospel, or who say they do, are
   often found believing historical statements that are not half as well
   proved. A man sits down and reads a book of the Gallic wars and he
   believes that Julius Caesar wrote it--yet there is not a half or a
   tenthas much evidence to prove that he did write it as there is to
   prove that our Lord Jesus lived, died and rose again from the dead! The
   witness to the truth of these great matters of fact has been borne by
   God, Himself, with signs, wonders and miracles. Honest and true men,
   Apostles and others, have witnessed them--and they have also been
   certified by Incarnate Deity, even by the Lord who deigns to speak to
   us by His Spirit. We cannot, therefore, trifle with this Gospel without
   incurring most serious guilt!

   5. For to the angels He has not put in subjection the world to come, of
   which we speak. We are the preachers of it-- not the angels! And the
   great Author and Finisher of our faith is the Man, Christ Jesus--not an
   angel. We have not, now, the ministry of angels, but the ministry of
   men, by whom the Lord of the angels sends His messages to their
   fellows.

   6-8. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
   You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him? You made
   him a little lower than the angles; You crowned him with glory and
   honor, and did set Him over the works of Your hands: You have put all
   things in subjection under his feet This was the original status of
   man. God made him to be His vicegerent on earth and he would still hold
   that position were it not that since he has rebelled against his own
   Sovereign, even the beasts of the field take liberty to be rebellious
   against him. Man is not now in his original estate and, therefore, he
   no longer rules. And we see many men who are very far from being royal
   beings, for they are mean and groveling. Yet the glory of man is not
   all lost, as we shall see.

   8, 9. For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing
   that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
   him. But we see Jesus. Here is the representative Man who is supreme
   over all. "We see Jesus."

   9, Who was made a little lower than the angels for suffering of death,
   crowned with glory and honor; that He, by the Grace of God, should
   taste death for every man. Oh, how glorious it is to realize our
   position in Christ and to see how He has lifted us up, not merely to
   the place from which the first Adam fell, but He has made us stand so
   securely there that we shall not again descend around the ruins of the
   Fall! Glory be to His holy name!

   10, 11. For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings. For both He that sanctifies and
   they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not
   ashamed to call them brethren. The Christ and the Christian are
   one--the Man, Christ Jesus, and the men whom He redefined are one! He
   has so become partaker of our nature that now we are one family and He
   is not ashamed to call us brothers and sisters. Am I addressing any who
   are ashamed of Christ, or who are ashamed of God's poor people, and who
   would not like to be known to be members of a poor Church? Ah, how you
   ought to be ashamed of yourselvesfor having any such pride in your
   hearts, for Christ is not ashamed to call His people brethren! Oh, what
   wondrous condescension! He has done this many times in the Psalms where
   He speaks of His brethren.

   12. Saying, I will declare Your name to My brethren, in the midst of
   the church will I sing praise to You. That is a quotation from the 22nd
   Psalm.

   13. And again, I will put My trust in Him. Thus entering into the very
   faith of His people!

   13, 14. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given Me.
   Inasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood. As
   you know to your cost, for perhaps you have aches and pains about you
   at this very moment. Verily, you are "partakers of flesh and blood."
   Perhaps you are suffering from despondency and depression of spirit. If
   so, that reminds you that however much you may, in spirit, sometimes
   soar to Heaven, yet you are still "partakers of flesh and blood."

   14, 15. He also, Himself, likewise took part of the same; that through
   death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage. He so took upon Himself flesh and blood as
   to die in our nature, that thus He might slay death, and might set us
   free from all fear of death. Do you not see that if the representative
   Man, Christ Jesus, died, He also rose again, and also that so will all
   who are in Him rise, too? If you are in Him, You shall rise again!
   Therefore, fear not to lie down in your last sleep, for the trumpet
   shall awaken you and your bodies shall be molded afresh like to His
   glorious body and your soul and body together shall dwell in infinite
   bliss forever! "Therefore comfort one another with these words."

Christ's Prayer for Peter

   (No. 2620)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 30, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 22, 1882.

   "But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not." Luke 22:32.

   SATAN has a deadly hatred towards all good men and they may rest
   assured that somewhere or other, he will meet them on their way to the
   Celestial City. John Bunyan, in his immortal allegory, placed him in
   one particular spot and described him as Apollyon straddling the road
   and swearing by his infernal den that the pilgrim should go no further,
   but that then and there he would spill poor Christian's soul. But the
   encounter with Apollyon does not happen in the same place to all
   pilgrims. I have known some of them assailed by him most fiercely at
   the outset of their march to Zion. Their first days as Christians have
   been truly terrible to them by reason of the Satanic attacks they have
   had to endure, but, afterwards, when the devil has left them, angels
   have ministered to them and they have had years of peace and joy. You
   remember that in the case of our Savior, no sooner was He baptized than
   He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the
   devil. In like manner, there are those whose fiercest trials from the
   adversary come at the beginning of their public ministry. Others meet
   with their greatest conflicts in middle life when, perhaps, they are
   too apt to think themselves secure against the assaults of Satan and to
   fancy that their experience and their knowledge will suffice to
   preserve them against his wiles. I know some, like Martin Luther, in
   whose voyage of life, the middle passage has been full of storm and
   tempest, and they have scarcely known what it was to have a moment's
   rest during all that period. Then there have been others, the first
   part of whose career has been singularly calm. Their life has been like
   a sea of glass--scarcely a ripple has been upon the waters--and yet,
   towards the end, the enemy has made up for it, and he has attacked them
   most ferociously right up to the last! I have known many instances of
   eminent saints who have had to die, sword in hand, and enter Heaven--I
   was about to say, with the marks of their stern conflict fresh upon
   them. At any rate, they have been crowned on the battlefield and have
   fallen asleep at the close of a tremendous fight.

   With the most of us who are really going to Heaven--I will not say that
   it is a rule without any exception--but with the most of us, at some
   time or another, we shall know the extreme value of this prayer, "Lead
   us not into temptation of any kind, but deliver us from the Evil One,
   who, beyond all others, is especially to be dreaded." There is little
   to be got out of him, even if we conquer him. He usually leaves some
   mark of his prowess upon us which we may carry to our graves. It were
   better to leap over hedge and ditch and to go a thousand miles further
   on our pilgrim road than ever to have a conflict with him, except for
   those great purposes of which I shall presently speak for a moment. The
   fight with Apollyon is a terrible ordeal--an ordeal, however, which a
   brave Christian will never think of shirking! No, he rather will
   rejoice that he has an enemy worthy of his steel, that true Damascus
   blade with which he is armed. And, in the name of God, he will
   determine, though he wrestles not with flesh and blood, that he will
   contend against principalities and powers and with the very leader of
   them all--that there may be all the more Glory to the great King who
   makes the weakest of His followers to be so strong that they put the
   old dragon, himself, to flight!

   So, dear Friends, rest assured that Satan hates every good man and
   woman, and that, some time or other, he is pretty sure to show that
   hatred in a very cruel and deadly attack upon them.

   Further, because of his hatred, Satan earnestly desires to put
   Believers into his sieve that he may sift them as wheat-- not that he
   wants to get the shaft away from them--but simply that he may agitate
   them. You see the corn in the sieve, how it goes up and down, to and
   fro. There is not a single grain of it that is allowed to have a
   moment's rest--it is all in commotion and confusion--and the man who is
   sifting it takes care to sift first one way and next, another way, and
   then all sorts of ways. Now, that is just what Satan does with those
   whom he hates, when he gets the opportunity. He sifts them in all
   manner of ways and puts their whole being into agitation and turmoil.
   When he gets a hold of us, it is a shaking and sifting, indeed! He
   takes care that anything like rest or breathing space shall be denied
   us.

   Satan desires thus to sift the saints in his sieve and, at times, God
   grants his desire. If you look at the Revised Version, in the margin
   you learn the true idea of Satan having asked, or rather obtained by
   asking, the power to sift Peter as wheat. God sometimes gives Satan the
   permission to sift as wheat those who are undoubtedly His people--and
   then Satan tosses them to and fro, indeed. That record in the Book of
   Job, of Satan appearing before God, is repeated in this story of Peter,
   for the devil had obtained from God liberty to try and test poor
   boasting Peter. If Christ had not obtained of God, in answer to His
   intercession, the promise of the preservation of Peter, then had it
   gone ill, indeed, with the self-confident Apostle! God grants to Satan
   permission to try His people in this way because He knows how He will
   overrule it to His own Glory and their good. There are certain Graces
   which are never produced in Christians, to a high degree, except by
   severe temptation. "I noticed," said one, "in what a chastened spirit a
   certain minister preached when he had been the subject of most painful
   temptation." There is a peculiar tenderness without which one is not
   qualified to shepherd Christ's sheep, or to feed His lambs--a
   tenderness without which one cannot strengthen his brethren, as Peter
   was afterwards to do, a tenderness which does not usually come--at any
   rate, to such a man as Peter, except by his being put into the sieve
   and tossed up and down by Satanic temptation!

   Let that stand as the preface of my sermon, for I shall not have so
   much to say upon that as upon another point.

   First, observe, in our text, the grand point of Satan's attack. We can
   see that from the place where Jesus puts the strongest line of
   defense--"I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not." The point
   of Satan's chief attack on a Believer, then, is his faith Observe,
   secondly, the peculiar danger of faith--"That your faith fail not."
   That is the danger--not merely lest it should be slackened and
   weakened, but lest it should fail And then observe, thirdly, the
   Believer's grand defense--"I have prayed for you, that your faith fail
   not."

   I. Notice carefully, in the first place, THE GRAND POINT OF SATAN'S
   ATTACK.

   When he assails a child of God, his main assault is upon his faith, and
   I suppose that the reason is, first, because faith is the vital point
   in the Christian. We are engrafted into Christ by faith and faith is
   the point of contact between the believing soul and the living Christ.
   If, therefore, Satan could manage to cut through the graft there, then
   he would defeat the Savior's work most completely. Faith is the very
   heart of true godliness, for, "the just shall live by faith." Take
   faith away and you have torn the heart out of the gracious man. Hence,
   Satan, as far as he can, aims his fiery darts at a Believer's faith. If
   he can only destroy faith, then he has destroyed the very life of the
   Christian! "Without faith it is impossible to please God." Therefore,
   if the devil could but get our faith away from us, we should cease to
   be pleasing to God and should cease to be "accepted in the Beloved."
   Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, look well to your faith! It is the
   very head and heart of your being as before God. The Lord grant that it
   may never fail you!

   I suppose that Satan also attacks faith because it is the chief of all
   our Divine Graces. Love, under some aspects, is the choicest, but to
   lead the van in conflict, faith must come first. And there are some
   things which are ascribed solely and entirely to faith that are never
   ascribed to love. If any man were to speak of our being justified by
   love, it would grate upon the ears of the godly! If any were to talk of
   our being justified by repentance, those of us who know our Bible would
   be up in arms against such a perversion of the Truth of God! But they
   may speak as long as they like of our "being justified by faith," for
   that is a quotation from the Scriptures. In the matter of
   justification, faith stands alone. It lays hold on Christ's Sacrifice
   and His righteousness and, thereby, the soul is justified. Faith, if I
   may say so, is the leader of the Graces in the day of battle and hence
   Satan says to his demoniacal archers, "Fight neither with small nor
   great, save only with the King of Israel--shoot at faith, kill it if
   possible." If faith is slain, where is love, where is hope, where is
   repentance, where is patience? If, faith is conquered, then it is as
   when a standard-bearer faints. The victory is virtually won by the
   arch-enemy if he is able to conquer faith, for faith is the noble
   chieftain among the Graces of a saint!

   I suppose, again, that Satan makes a dead set upon the faith of the
   Christian became it is the nourishing Grace. All the other Graces
   within us derive strength from our faith. If faith is at a low ebb,
   love is sure to burn very feebly. If faith should begin to fail, then
   would hope grow dim. Where is courage? It is a poor puny thing when
   faith is weak. Take any

   Grace you please, and you shall see that its nourishing depends upon
   the healthy condition of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ! To take faith
   away, therefore, would be to take the fountain away from the stream--it
   would be to withdraw the sun from its rays if light. If you destroy the
   source, of course that which comes out of it ceases. Therefore,
   Beloved, take the utmost possible care of your faith, for I may truly
   say of it that out of it are the issues of life to all your Graces.
   Faith is that virtuous woman who clothes the whole household in scarlet
   and feeds them all with luscious and strengthening food. But if faith
   is gone, the household soon becomes naked, poor, blind and miserable.
   Everything in a Christian fails when faith ceases to nourish it!

   Next to this, Satan attacks faith because it is the great preserving
   Grace. The Apostle says, "Above all"--that is, "over all," "covering
   all"--"taking the shield of faith with which you shall be able to
   quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." Sometimes, the Eastern
   soldiers had shields so large that they were like doors, and they
   covered the man from head to foot. Others of them, who used smaller
   shields, nevertheless handled them so deftly and moved them so rapidly
   that it was tantamount to the shield covering the entire person. An
   arrow is aimed at the forehead, up goes the shield and the sharp point
   rings on the metal! A javelin is hurled at the heart, but the shield
   turns it aside. The fierce foe aims a poisonous dart at the leg, but
   the shield intercepts it. Virtually, the shield is all-surrounding--and
   so it is with your faith. As one has well said, "It is armor upon
   armor, for the helmet protects the head, but the shield protects both
   helmet and head. The breastplate guards the breast, but the bucker or
   shield defends the breastplate as well as the breast." Faith is a
   Divine Grace to protect the other Graces--there is nothing like it and,
   therefore, I do not wonder that Satan attacks faith when he sees its
   prominent position and its important influence in the entire town of
   Mansoul.

   I cannot help saying, also, that I wonder not that Satan attacks faith
   because it is the effective or efficient Grace. You know what a
   wonderful chapter that 11th Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews
   is--it is a triumphal arch erected in honor of what? Of faith!
   According to that Chapter, faith did everything--it quenched the fire,
   stopped the mouths of lions, turned to flight the armies of the aliens,
   received the dead who were raised and so on. Faith is the soul's right
   hand. Faith works by love, but, still, it is faith that works, and you
   can do nothing acceptably before God unless you do it by that right
   hand of faith. Hence, Satan cannot stand faith--he hates that most of
   all. Pharaoh tried to have all the male children thrown into the river
   because they were the fighting force of Israel. He did not mind having
   the women to grow up to bear burdens--it was the men whom he feared.
   And, in like manner, the devil says, "I must stamp out faith, for that
   is the secret of strength." He will not trouble himself so much about
   your other Graces--he will probably attack them when he can, but, first
   of all he says--"Down with faith! That is the man-child that must be
   destroyed!" And he aims his sharpest and deadliest darts at it.

   I believe, also, that faith is attacked by Satan, most of all, because
   it is most obnoxious to him. He cannot endure faith. How do I know
   that? Why, because God loves it! And if God loves faith and if Christ
   crowns faith, I am sure that Satan hates it. What are we told
   concerning the work of Jesus being hindered by unbelief? "He could not
   do many mighty works there because of their unbelief." Now, I will turn
   that text around and say of Satan, that he cannot do many mighty works
   against some men because of their faith! Oh, how he sneaks off when he
   discovers a right royal faith in a man! He knows when he has met his
   master and he says, "Why should I waste my arrows upon a shield carried
   by such a man as that? He believes in God, he believes in Christ, he
   believes in the Holy Spirit--he is more than a match for me." To those
   that are under his leadership, he cries, "To your tents!" He bids them
   flee away and escape, for he knows that there can be no victory for
   them when they come into collision with true God-given faith! He cannot
   bear to look at it. It blinds him--the lustrous splendor of that great
   shield of faith which shines as though a man did hang the sun upon his
   arm and bear it before him into the fray--blinds even the mighty Prince
   of Darkness! Satan does but glance at it and straightway he takes to
   flight, for he cannot stand it. He knows it is the thing which most of
   all helps to overthrow his kingdom and destroy his power! Therefore,
   Believer, cling to your faith! Be like the young Spartan warrior who
   would either bring his shield home with him or be brought home dead
   upon his shield. "Cast not away your confidence, which has great
   recompense of reward." Whatever else you have not, "have faith in God."
   Believe in the Christ of God. Rest your soul's entire confidence upon
   the faithful promise and the faithful Promiser and, if you do so,
   Satan's attacks upon you will all be in vain!

   That is my first point--observe the grand point of Satanic attack.

   II. Now, secondly, observe THE PECULIAR DANGER OF FAITH. "That your
   faith fail not."

   Did Peter's faith fail? Yes, and no. It failed in a measure, but it did
   not altogether fail. It failed in a measure, for he was human, but it
   did not altogether fail, for, at the back of it, there was the
   superhuman power which comes through the pleading of Christ. Poor
   Peter! He denied his Master, yet his faith did not utterly fail and, I
   will show you why it did not. If you and I, Beloved, are ever permitted
   to dishonor God and to deny our Lord, as Peter did, yet may God in
   mercy keep us from the utter and entire failure of our faith as He kept
   Peter!

   Notice, first, there was still some faith in Peter, even when he had
   denied his Master, for when the Lord turned and looked at him, he went
   out and wept bitterly If there had still not been the true faith in
   Peter, the Master might have looked upon him long before a tear would
   have coursed down his cheeks. The Lord not only looked on Judas, but He
   gave him a sop with Him out of the dish. And He even let the traitor
   put his lips on Him and kiss Him. But all that had no weight with
   Judas. The reason why Christ's look had such an effect on Peter was
   because there was still some faith in Peter. You may blow as long as
   you like at the cold coals, but you will get no fire. But I have,
   sometimes, seen a servant kneel down when there has been just a little
   flame left in the coal in a corner of the grate, and she has blown it
   tenderly and gently so as to revive it. "It is not quite out," she says
   and, at last, there has been a good fire once again! May God grant that
   we may never come to that sad condition, but, if we do, may He, of His
   Grace, grant that there may still be that blessed little faith left,
   that weak and feeble faith which, through the breathing upon it of the
   Spirit of God, shall yet be fanned into a flame!

   We are sure that there was this faith still in Peter or else what would
   he have done? What did Judas do? Judas did two things. First, he went
   to a priest, or to priests, and confessed to them. And then he went out
   and hanged himself-- the two things were strangely connected. Peter did
   neither, yet, if he had not had faith, he might have done both. To
   publicly deny his Master three times and to support his denial with
   oaths and curses, even when that Master was close by and in His
   greatest need, must have put Peter into most imminent peril. And if
   there had not been, within his heart, faith that his Master could yet
   pardon and restore him, he might, in his despair, have done precisely
   what the traitor Judas did. Or, if he had not gone to that extremity of
   guilt, he would have hidden himself away from the rest of the Apostles.
   But, instead of doing so, we soon find him, again, with John--I do not
   wonder that he was with John. They were old companions, but, in
   addition to that, the Beloved John had so often leaned his head on the
   Master's bosom that he had caught the sweet infection of his Savior's
   tenderness and, therefore, he was just the one with whom Peter would
   wish to associate.

   I think that if I had ever denied my Lord as Peter did, in that public
   way, I would have run away and hidden myself from all my former
   companions. But Peter did not, you see. He seemed to say to himself,
   "The Master, with His dear tender heart, can still forgive me and
   receive me." So he clings to the disciples and especially to John. Yes,
   and notice that on the day of our Lord's Resurrection, Peter was the
   first disciple to enter the sepulcher, for, though "the other disciple
   did outrun Peter" and reach the grave first, "yet he went not in" until
   Peter led the way. "The Lord is risen, indeed, and has appeared to
   Simon," is a remarkable passage. Paul, writing concerning Christ's
   Resurrection, says that, "He was seen of Cephas," that is, Peter. There
   was some special manifestation of our blessed Master to Simon Peter who
   was waiting for it, and privileged to witness it--and this showed that
   his faith was kept from failing through the Savior's prayers.

   Now, Beloved, I say no more about Peter, but I speak to you about your
   own faith. Are you greatly troubled? Then I pray that your faith may
   not fail. It is shaken. It is severely tried, but God grant that it may
   not fail! Something whispers within your heart, "Give up all religion,
   it is not true." To that lie, answer, "Get you behind me, Satan, for
   the religion of Jesus Christ is eternally, assuredly, Infallibly true."
   Cling to it, for it is your life! Or, perhaps, the fiend whispers, "It
   is true enough to others, but it is not meant for you, you are not one
   of the Lord's people." Well, if you cannot come to Christ as a saint,
   come to Him as a sinner! If you dare not come as a child to sit at His
   Table, come as a dog to eat the crumbs that fall under it! Only come
   and never give up your faith!

   If the arch-fiend whispers, again, "You have been a deceiver! Your
   profession is all a mistake, or a lie!" Say to him, "Well, if it is so,
   there is still forgiveness in Christ for all who come unto God by Him."
   Perhaps you are coming to the Savior for the first time--you mean to
   cast yourself upon the blood and merit of Jesus even if you have never
   done so before. I pray for you, dear coming one! O gracious Savior, do
   not let Satan crush out the faith of even the weakest of Your people!
   Blessed Intercessor, plead for that poor trembler in whom faith is
   almost dying out! Great High Priest, intercede for him, that his faith
   may not utterly fail him and that he may still cling to You!

   What is to become of us if we have not faith in Jesus? I know that
   there are some who seem to get on well without it. So may the dogs. So
   may the wild beasts. They get on well enough without the children's
   garments or the children's bread--but you and I cannot. The moment I am
   unbelieving, I am unhappy. It is not a vain thing for me to believe in
   Christ--it is my life, it is my strength, it is my joy! I am a lost man
   and it were better for me that I had never been born unless I have the
   privilege of believing! Give up faith? Remember what Satan said
   concerning Job, "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give
   for his life"? And our life is wrapped up in our faith in Christ! We
   cannot give it up and we will not give it up! Come on, fiends of Hell,
   or mockers of earth--we will not give it up, we will hold it fast, for
   it is part of the very warp and woof of our being! We believe in God
   and in His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And it is our great
   concern that our faith should be well guarded and protected, for we
   know the peculiar danger to which it is exposed when it is assailed by
   Satan.

   III. Now I will close my discourse by speaking, for only a very few
   minutes, upon THE BELIEVER'S GREAT PRESERVATIVE AND DEFENSE.

   What is the great protection of our faith? Our Savior's intercession!
   Prayer is always good, it is always a blessed thing, but notice that
   great letter-word in the text, "I have prayed for you." It is the
   intercession of Christthat preserves our faith--and there are three
   things about it which make it precious beyond all price--it is
   prevalent, prevenient and pertinent. First, it is prevalent, for, if
   Jesus pleads, He must prevail. It is prevenient, for, before the
   temptation comes to Peter, He says, "I have prayed for you. Satan has
   but obtained, by his asking, the permission to tempt you, but I have
   already prayed for you."

   And, then, it was pertinent, that is, to the point. Christ had prayed
   the best prayer possible--"that your faith fail not." Peter would not
   have known that this was to be the chief point of attack by Satan. He
   might have thought that Satan would attack his love. The Lord seems to
   hint at His thought about that by saying to him, afterwards, "Simon,
   son of Jonas, do you love Me?" But the Savior knew that the hottest
   part of the battle would rage around Fort Faith and, therefore, He
   prayed that the fortress might be well garrisoned and never be captured
   by the enemy. And it was not!

   Whenever I begin to talk to you about the intercession of Christ, I
   feel inclined to sit down and let you think, and look up, and listen
   till you hear that Voice, matchless in its music, pleading, pleading,
   pleading, with the Father! It were much better for you to realize it
   than for me to describe it. It was a blessed thing to hear one's mother
   pray--by accident, as we say--to pass the door that was ajar and to
   hear Mother pleading for her boy or her girl. It is a very touching
   thing to hear your child praying for her father, or your wife breathing
   out her warm desires for her Beloved. I do not know anything more
   charming than to hear, now and then, a stray prayer that was never
   meant to be heard on earth, but only in Heaven. I like such
   eaves-droppings. Oh, but listen! It is Jesus who is praying! He shows
   His wounds and pleads the merit of His great Sacrifice and, wonder of
   wonders, He pleads for me, and for you! Happy man, happy woman, to have
   our faith preserved by such a mighty preservative as this--the
   intercession of Christ!

   I want you to especially notice that this intercession is the pleading
   of One who, in the text, seems to directly oppose Himself to the great
   adversary ' 'Satan has asked for you by asking that he may sift you as
   wheat; but I have prayed for you by asking," (so I will venture to
   paraphrase it) "that your faith fail not." There stands Satan. You
   cannot see him and you need not want to, but that grim monster who has
   made kings and princes tremble, and has plucked angels from their
   spheres of light, and hurled bright spirits down from Heaven to Hell,
   stands there to assail you! And you may well be afraid, for God,
   Himself, permits him to sift you! Ah, but there also stands the
   Ever-Blessed One, before whom an angel, fallen or unfallen, is but a
   tiny spark compared with the sun! There He stands, girt about the chest
   with the golden girdle of His faithfulness, robed in the fair white
   linen of His matchless righteousness. Upon His head is a crown of glory
   that far outshines all constellations of stars and suns! And He opposes
   His Divine pleading to the demoniacal asking of the fallen one. Are you
   still afraid? It seems to me unspeakably blessed to see it written
   here, "Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat,"
   and then to see over the top of it these words, "but I have prayed for
   you." Oh, blessed, "but"! How it seems to cast the fallen angel back
   into the bottomless Pit and to bind him with chains, and set a seal
   upon his prison--"But I have prayed for you." Tempt on, then, O Satan!
   Tempt at your worst, for there is no fear when this glorious shield of
   gold, the intercession of the Savior, covers the entire person of the
   poor attacked one! "I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not."

   And then my last word is this--it is an intercession which is
   absolutely certain of success. In fact, He who offers it anticipates
   its success and discounts it by giving this precept to His
   servant--"and when you are converted." Sure pledge, then, that he will
   beconverted, that he will be turned back, however far he wanders! When
   you are restored, "strengthen your brethren." Then, for certain, he
   will be restored, or else the Savior would not have given him a precept
   which could only be available if a certain, unlikely contingency should
   occur! O you who are a true child of God, you may be drenched, but you
   shall never be drowned! O warrior of the Cross, your shield may be
   covered with fiery darts, thick as the saplings of a young forest--but
   no dart shall ever reach your heart! You may be wounded in head and
   hand and foot. You may be a mass of scars, but your life is given you!
   To Christ are you given and you shall come out even from between the
   jaws of death--and you shall overcome Satan by Christ's power! Only
   trust Christ! Only trust Him! Cling to your faith, Beloved. Cling to
   your faith! I would like to get a hold of that young man who has lately
   been listening to skeptical teachers, and to whisper in his ear, "Cling
   to your faith, young man, for, in losing that, you will lose all."

   And to you who, alas, have fallen into sin after having made a
   profession of religion, let me say that, however far you have gone
   astray, still believe that Jesus is able to forgive you! Come back to
   Him and seek His pardon now! And you, my hoary-headed Brothers and
   Sisters, whose hair is whitening for Heaven, are you sorely beset by
   all sorts of temptations? Well, give me your hand, for I, too, know
   what this warfare means. Let us believe in God, my Brothers and
   Sisters--let us believe in God! Though He should break us down worse
   than ever. Though He should set us up as a target and let the devil
   shoot all the arrows from his quiver at us, let us still believe in God
   and come to this point to which my soul has come full often, and to
   which Job came of old, "'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.'
   Whatever He does to me-- if He shall never smile upon me again--I will
   still believe Him, I can do no other." I dare not doubt Him! I must
   confide in Him! Where is there any ground for confidence if it is not
   in the God that cannot lie, and in the Christ of the Everlasting
   Covenant whom He has set forth to be the propitiation for human sin,
   and in the Holy Spirit, whose work it is to take of the things of
   Christ and reveal them to us?

   May the blessed Trinity save and keep us all, for our Lord Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE22:7-34; 54-62.

   Verses 7-20. Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover
   must be killed. And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us
   the Passover, that we may eat And they said unto Him, Where will You
   that we prepare? And He said unto them, Behold, when you are entered
   into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
   follow him into the house where he enters. And you shall say unto the
   good man of the house, The Master says unto you, Where is the guest
   chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with My disciples? And he shall
   show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. And they went
   and found as He had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover
   And when the hour was come, He sat down, and the twelve Apostles with
   Him. And He said unto them. With desire I have desired to eat this
   Passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I will not any
   more eat thereof until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. And He
   took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among
   yourselves: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the
   wine, until the Kingdom of God shall come. And He took bread, and gave
   thanks, and broke it, and gave unto them, saying, This is My body which
   is given for you: this do in remembrance of Me. Likewise also the cup
   after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament--(Or, Covenant).

   20, 21. In My blood, which is shed for you. But, behold, the hand of
   him that betrays Me is with Me on the table. What a shadow this
   revelation must have cast over that solemn feast, over the Savior's
   heart and over the minds of all His attached disciples! We can scarcely
   imagine what pangs tore His loving spirit. He could have used the
   language of David with even deeper emphasis, and said, "It was not an
   enemy that reproached Me. Then I could have borne it: neither was it he
   that hated Me that did magnify himself against Me. Then I would have
   hid Myself from him. But it was you, a man My equal, My guide and My
   acquaintance." "The hand of him that betrays Me is with Me on the
   table." O Beloved, I pray that you and I may never betray our Master!
   If ever we should so fail as to deny Him, may the Lord stop us where
   Peter fell and never suffer us to betray Him as Judas did!

   22. And truly thee Son of Man goes, as it was determined: but woe unto
   that man by whom He is betrayed! The decree of God does not lessen the
   responsibility of man for his action. Even though it is predetermined
   of God, the man does it of his own free will--and on him falls the full
   guilt of it.

   23, 24. And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
   was that should do this thing. And there was also a strife among them,
   which of them should be accounted the greatest. Be astonished, dear
   Friends, as you read, in such a connection as this, "There was also a
   strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
   What? While yet the anxious question as to which of them was the
   traitor was being passed round, "Lord, is it I?" Is it so closely
   followed by another question, "Which of us shall be highest in the
   Kingdom?" Oh, the awful intrusiveness of pride and ambition! How it
   will come in and defile the very Holy of Holies! May God prevent our
   falling victims to it! The last question for a Christian to ever ask
   is, "How may I win honor among men?" The one question for a Believer
   should be, "How can I glorify my Master ?" Very often, that can best be
   done by taking the very lowest place in his Church.

   25, 26. And He said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
   lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are
   called benefactors. But you shall not be so: but he that is greatest
   among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
   serves. Let every respect be given to the elder and let such as God
   honors be honored among us--but let no man honor himself, or seek honor
   for himself! After all, in Christ's Kingdom, the way to ascend is to
   descend! Did not the Master act thus? He descended that He might ascend
   and fill all things! And so must His disciples! Less, and less, and
   less, and less must we become--and so we shall really be, in His
   sight--more, and more, and more, and more!

   27. For who is greater, he that sits at meat, or he that serves?Is it
   not he that sits at meat? But I am among you as He that serves. For He
   had just then taken a towel and girded Himself, and washed their
   feet--so becoming Servus ser-vorum, the Servant of Servants, though He
   was, in very truth, the King of Kings!

   28. You are they who have continued with Me in My temptations. There is
   a reward to the righteous, though they serve not for reward, for the
   Lord says--

   29. 30. AndIappoint unto you a Kingdom, as My Father has appointed unto
   Me; that you may eat and drink at My table in My Kingdom, and sit on
   thrones judging the twelve tribes ofIsrael. Ah, but see what follows!
   No sooner, in this Chapter, does the thought seem to rise than it is
   dashed down again! The brightness always has a shadow cast across it,

   31, 32. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to
   have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for you,
   that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your
   brethren. We are thinking about thrones and about which of us shall
   have the loftiest throne--but see how the Master is thinking about the
   necessary while we are doting upon the superfluous! He thinks of our
   needs while we are dreaming of something great. What a blessing it is
   that we have our Savior praying for us when we, ourselves, may be
   fancying that we need not pray! Our hands are ready for the scepter and
   we are anxious to sit down on the throne--when the Lord knows that our
   proper place is at the footstool, pleading for mercy!

   33. And he said unto Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both into
   prison, and to death. That is bravely spoken, Peter--and yet it is very
   foolishly said, too! He spoke out of his very heart and he meant what
   he said, but Peter did not know what a poor weak body Peter really was!
   His Master understood him far better.

   34. And He said, I tellyou, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day,
   before that you shall thrice deny that you know Me. And so it came to
   pass. Let as read a part of the sad story, beginning at the 54th verse.

   54. Then took they Him, andled Him, and brought Him into the High
   Priest's house. And Peter followedafar off. I do not think that Peter
   was to be blamed for that. I do not see how he could very well have
   followed any nearer, for he was already a marked man. That cutting off
   of the ear of Malchus had made him especially prominent among the
   Apostles, even if he had not been well known before! He got into the
   crowd and came after his Master at such a distance as seemed safe for
   him.

   55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were
   set down together, Peter sat down among them. I do think that he was to
   be blamed for that action, for it brought him into dangerous company.
   Better be cold, than go and warm your hands in ungodly society!

   56. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
   looked upon him. As the flame came flashing up every now and then, she
   looked at him, and Peter was troubled by her gaze--she, "earnestly
   looked upon him."

   56-59. And said, This man was also with Him. And he denied Him, saying,
   Woman, I know Him not And after a little while another saw him, and
   said, You are also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not And about the
   space of one hour, later, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a
   truth, this fellow also was with Him; for he is a Galilean. For he got
   to talking to this evil company and his speech had betrayed him!

   60. And Peter said, Man, I know not what you say. Another Evangelist
   tells us that he began to curse and to swear, as if that was the surest
   proof that he could possibly give that he did not know Jesus--for, when
   you hear a man swear, you know at once that he is no Christian--you may
   conclude that safely enough! So Peter thought that to prove that he was
   no follower of Christ, he would use such evil language as the ungodly
   speak.

   60, 61. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the rooster crowed. And
   the Lord turned and looked upon Peter God has all things in His hands.
   He has servants everywhere and the rooster shall crow, by the secret
   movement of His Providence, just when God wills! And there is, perhaps,
   as much of Divine ordination about the crowing of a rooster as about
   the ascending of an emperor to his throne! Things are only little and
   great according to their bearings and God reckoned not the crowing bird
   to be a small thing since it was to bring a wanderer back to his
   Savior, for, just as the rooster crowed, "the Lord turned and looked
   upon Peter." That was a different look from the one which the girl had
   given him, but that look broke his heart.

   62. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said unto
   him, Before the roster crows, you shall deny me thrice. And Peter went
   out and wept bitterly. How many there are who sin with Peter, but who
   never weep with Peter! Oh, if we have ever transgressed in such a way
   as he did, let us never cease to weep! Above all, let us begin at once
   to lament it and rest not till the Master looks again, and says by that
   look, "I have blotted out all your transgressions; return unto Me."

The Sinner's Refuge

   (No. 2621)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 7, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING, EARLY IN
   THE YEAR 1857.

   "Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that
   the slayer may flee there, who kills any person at unawares." Numbers
   35:11.

   YOU are aware that the principle of blood-revenge is a deep-seated one
   in the Eastern mind. From the earliest ages it was always the custom
   with the Orientals, when a man was murdered, or slain without malice
   aforethought, for the nearest relative, his heir, or any person related
   to him, to take revenge for him upon the person who, either
   intentionally or unintentionally, was the means of his death. This
   revenge was a very special thing to the Oriental mind. The avenger of
   blood would hunt his victim for 40 years--yes, until he died, if he was
   not able to reach him before--and would be on his trail all his life,
   that he might slay him. It was not necessary that the manslayer should
   have any trial before a judge-- his victim was dead and if the one who
   killed him was not put to death, it was reckoned among some tribes to
   be legitimate to kill his father, or indeed any member of his
   tribe--and until someone in that tribe was put to death, as a revenge
   for the man who had been slain, by accident or otherwise, a deadly feud
   existed between the two clans which never could be quenched except by
   blood.

   Now, when the Lord gave to the Jews this Law concerning the cities of
   refuge, he took advantage of their deep-rooted love towards the system
   of the revenge of blood by the nearest relative. God acted wisely in
   this, as He has done in all things. There are two matters mentioned in
   Scripture which I do not believe God ever approved, but which, finding
   they were deep-seated, He did not forbid to the Jews. One was polygamy,
   the practice of marrying many wives had become so established that,
   though God abhorred it, yet He permitted it to the Jews because He
   foresaw that they would inevitably have broken the commandment if He
   had made an ordinance that they should have but one wife. It was the
   same with this matter of blood-revenge--it was so firmly fixed in the
   mind of the people that God, instead of refusing to the Jews what they
   regarded as the privilege of taking vengeance upon their fellows,
   enacted a Law which rendered it almost impossible that a man should be
   killed unless he were really a murderer, for He appointed six cities,
   at convenient distances, so that when one man killed another by
   accident, and so committed homicide, he might at once flee to one of
   those cities. And though he might have to remain there all his life,
   yet the avenger of blood could never touch him, if he were innocent. He
   would have a fair trial, but even if he were found innocent, he must
   stay within the city into which the avenger of blood could not, by any
   possibility, come. If he went out of the city, the avenger might kill
   him. He was, therefore, to suffer perpetual banishment, even for
   causing death accidentally, in order that it might be seen how much God
   regarded the rights of blood and how fearful a thing it is to put a man
   to death in any way. You see, dear Friends, that this prevented. the
   likelihood of anyone being killed who was not guilty of murder, for, as
   soon as one man struck another to the ground by accident, by a stone,
   or any other means, he fled to a city of refuge. He had a head start
   from the pursuer and if he arrived there first, he was secure and safe.

   I wish to use this custom of the Jews as a metaphor and type to set
   forth the salvation of men through Jesus Christ our Lord. I shall give
   you, first, an explanation and, then, an exhortation.

   I. I SHALL ATTEMPT AN EXPLANATION OF THIS TYPE. Note, first, the person
   for whom the city of refuge was provided. It was not a place of shelter
   for the willful murderer--if he fled there, after a fair trial he must
   be dragged out of it and given up to the avenger. And the avenger of
   death was to kill him and so have blood for blood, and life for life.
   But, in case of an accident, when one man had slain another without
   malice aforethought and had, therefore, only committed homicide, the
   man fleeing there was perfectly safe.

   Here, however, the type does not adequately represent the work of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. He is not a refuge provided for men who are
   innocent, but for men who are guilty--not for those who have
   accidentally transgressed, but for those who have willfully gone
   astray! Our Savior has come into the world to save not those who have,
   by mistake and error, committed sin, but those who have fearfully
   transgressed against well-known Divine Commandments and who have
   followed the sinful dictates of their own free will, their own
   perversity leading them to rebel against God.

   Note, next, the avenger of blood. In explaining this portion of the
   type, I must, of course, take every part of the figure. The avenger of
   blood, I have said, was usually the next of kin to the one who had been
   slain. But I believe any other member of the family was held to be
   competent to act as the avenger. If, for instance, my brother had been
   killed, it would have been my duty, as the first of the family, to
   avenge his blood, if possible, then and there --to go after the
   murderer, or the man who had accidentally caused his death--and to put
   him to death at once. If I could not do that, it would be my business
   and that of my father and, indeed, of every male member of the family,
   to hunt and pursue that man until God should deliver him into our hands
   so that we might put him to death. I mean not that it is nowour duty,
   but it would have been so regarded under the old Jewish dispensation.
   It was allowed, by the Mosaic Law, that those who were the relatives of
   the man killed would be the avengers of his blood.

   We find the counterpart of this type, for the sinner, in the Law of
   God. Sinner, the Law of God is the blood-avenger that is on your trail!
   You have willfully transgressed--you have, as it were, killed God's
   Commandments, you have trampled them under your feet--and so the Law of
   God is the avenger of blood. It is after you and it will have you in
   its grasp before long! Condemnation is hanging over your head and it
   shall surely overtake you! Though it may not reach you in this life,
   yet, in the world to come, the avenger of blood, the Moses, the Law of
   the Lord, shall execute vengeance upon you and you shall be utterly
   destroyed!

   But, further, there was a city of refuge provided under the Law of
   God--no, more, there were six cites of refuge, in order that one of
   them might be at a convenient distance from any part of the country.
   Now, there are not six Christs-- there is but one, but there is a
   Christ everywhere. "The Word of God is near you, even in your mouth and
   in your heart, that is, the Word of faith which we preach, that if you
   shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your
   heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. For
   with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation."

   The city of refuge was a priestly city--a city of the Levites, and it
   afforded protection for life to the manslayer. He might never go out of
   it till the death of the then reigning High Priest, after which he
   might go free without being touched by the avenger of blood. But,
   during the time of his sojourn there, he was housed and fed
   gratuitously-- everything was provided for him and he was kept entirely
   safe! And I would have you mark that he was safe in this city, not
   because of its walls, or bolts, or bars, but simply because it was the
   place Divinely appointed for shelter. Do you see the man running
   towards it? The avenger is after him, fast and furious! The manslayer
   has just reached the borders of the city--in a moment the avenger
   stops--he knows it is no use going any further after him, not because
   the city walls are strong, nor because the gates are barred, nor
   because an army stands outside to resist, but because God has said the
   man shall be safe as soon as he has crossed the border and has come
   into the suburbs of the city! Divine appointment was the only thing
   which made the city of refuge secure! Now, Beloved, our Lord Jesus
   Christ is the Divinely-appointed way of salvation! Whoever among us
   shall make haste from our sins and flee to Christ, being convinced of
   our guilt, and helped by God's Spirit to enter that road, shall,
   without doubt, find absolute and eternal security! The curse of the Law
   of God shall not touch us, Satan shall not harm us, vengeance shall not
   reach us, for the Divine appointment, stronger than gates of iron or
   brass, shields everyone of us "who have fled for refuge to lay hold
   upon the hope set before us" in the Gospel!

   The city of refuge, I must have you note, too, had around it, suburbs
   of a very great extent. Two thousand cubits were allowed for grazing
   land for the cattle of the priests and a thousand cubits within these
   for fields and vineyards. Now, no sooner did the man reach the suburbs
   of the city, than he was safe--it was not necessary for him to get
   within the walls, but the outskirts, themselves, were sufficient
   protection. Learn, then, that if you do but touch the hem of

   Christ's garment, you shall be made whole! If you do but lay hold of
   Him with "faith as a grain of mustard seed," with faith which is very
   feeble, but is truly a living principle, you are safe--

   "A little genuine Grace ensures

   The death of all our sins!"

   Get anywhere within the borders of the city of refuge and you are, at
   once and forever, secure from the avenger!

   We have some interesting particulars, also, with regard to the distance
   of these cities from the habitations of men in ancient Judea. It is
   said that wherever the crime of homicide might be committed by any man,
   he might get to a city of refuge within half a day and, verily,
   Beloved, it is no great distance from a guilty sinner to the sheltering
   breast of Christ! It is but a simple renunciation of our own powers and
   a laying hold of Christ, to be our All-in-All, that is required in
   order to our being found within the city of refuge! Then, with regard
   to the roads to the city, we are told that they were strictly preserved
   in good order. Every river was bridged. As far as possible, the road
   was made level and every obstruction removed so that the man who fled
   might find an easy passage to the city. Once a year the elders of the
   city went along the route to see that it was in proper repair and to
   assure, as far as they could, that nothing might occur through the
   breaking down of bridges, or the blocking of the highway, to impede the
   flight of any manslayer and cause him to be overtaken and killed.
   Wherever there were by-roads and turns, there were legible sign-posts
   with this word plainly visible upon them, "Refuge"--"Refuge"--pointing
   out the way in which the man should flee if he wished to reach the
   city. There were two people always kept on the road, so that in case
   the avenger of blood should overtake a man, they might intercept him
   and entreat him to stay his hand until the man had reached the city,
   lest innocent blood should be shed without a fair trial--and so the
   avenger himself would be proved guilty of murder. The risk, of course,
   was upon the head of the avenger if he put one to death who did not
   deserve to die.

   Now, Beloved, I think this is a picture of the road to Christ Jesus. It
   is no roundabout road of the Law--it is no obeying this, that, and the
   other command--it is a straight road. "Believe, and live." It is a road
   so hard that no self-righteous man will ever tread it, but it is a road
   so easy that every man who knows himself to be a sinner may, by it,
   find his way to Christ and his way to Heaven! And lest any should be
   mistaken, God has set me and my Brothers in the ministry to be like
   hand-posts in the way, to point poor sinners to Jesus! And we desire to
   always have on our lips the cry, "Refuge! Refge/REFUGE!" Sinner, this
   is the way! Walk you therein and you shall be saved!

   I think I have thus given the explanation of the type. Christ is the
   true City of Refuge and He preserves all those who flee to Him for
   mercy. He does that because He is the Divinely-appointed Savior, able
   to save unto the uttermost all them that come to God by Him.

   II. Now, in the second place, I HAVE TO GIVE AN EXHORTATION.

   You must allow me to picture a scene. You see that man in the field? He
   has been at work. He has taken an ox-goad in his hand, to use it in
   some part of his farm work. Unfortunately, instead of doing what he
   desires to do, he strikes a companion of his in the heart and he falls
   down dead! You see the poor fellow with horror in his face. He is a
   guiltless man, but, oh, what misery he feels when he gazes upon the
   corpse lying at his feet! A pang shoots through his heart, such as you
   and I have never felt--horror, dread, desolation! Yes, some of us have
   felt something akin to it spiritually--we will not allude to the when
   and the why--but who can describe the agony of a man who beholds his
   companion fall lifeless by his side? Words are incapable of expressing
   the anguish of his spirit! He looks upon him, he tries to lift him up--
   he makes sure that he is really dead--what does he do next? Do you not
   see him? In a moment, he flies out of the field where he was at labor
   and runs along the road with all his might! He has many weary miles
   before him--six long hours of hard running--and as he passes the gate,
   he turns his head and there is the man's brother! He has just come into
   the field and seen his brother lying dead!

   Oh, can you conceive how the manslayer's heart palpitates with fear? He
   has a little head start on the road--he sees the avenger of blood, with
   red face, hot and fiery, rushing out of the field with the ox-goad in
   his hand, and running after him! The way lies through the village where
   the dead man's father lives--how fast the poor fugitive flees through
   the streets! He does not even stop to bid good-bye to his wife, nor to
   kiss his children--but on, on, he speeds for his very life! The
   relative calls to his father and his other friends--and now they all
   rush after him. Now there is quite a troop on the road--the man is
   still ahead, there is no rest for him. Though one of his pursuers may
   pause for a while, or turn back, the others still trail him. There is a
   horse in the village. They mount it and pursue him. If they can find
   any animal that can assist their swiftness, they will take it. Can you
   not conceive of the manslayer crying, "Oh, that I had wings, that I
   might fly to the city of refuge"? See how he spurns the earth beneath
   his feet! What, to him, are the green fields on either hand? What are
   the babbling brooks? He stops not even so much as to wet his lips! The
   sun is scorching him, but still on, on, on, he runs! He casts aside one
   garment after another! He still rushes on and the pursuers are close
   behind him. He feels like the poor stag hunted by the hounds--he knows
   they are eager for his blood and that if they do but once overtake him,
   it will be a word, a blow--and he will be a dead man. Watch how he
   speeds on his way! Do you see him now? A town is rising into sight! He
   perceives the towers of the city of refuge--but his weary feet almost
   refuse to carry him further! The veins are standing out on his brow
   like whipcords! The blood spurts from his nostrils--he is straining all
   his powers to the utmost as he rushes on--he would go faster if he had
   any more strength. The pursuers are after him--they have almost caught
   him, but see, and rejoice! He has just reached the outskirts of the
   city--there is the line of demarcation--he leaps over it and falls
   senseless to the ground--but there is joy in his heart.

   The pursuers come and look at him, but they dare not slay him. The
   knife is in their hands and the stones, too, but they dare not touch
   him. He is safe, he is secure! His running has been just fast
   enough--he has managed to leap into the kingdom of life and to avoid a
   cruel and terrible death.

   Sinner, that picture I have given you is a picture of yourself, in all
   but the man's guiltlessness, for you area guilty man! Oh, if you did
   but know that the avenger of blood is after you! Oh, that God would
   give you Grace that you might have a sense of your danger tonight! You
   would then not stop a solitary instant without fleeing to Christ. You
   would say, even while sitting in your pew, "Let me get away, away,
   away, where mercy is to be found," and you would give neither sleep to
   your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids till you had found in Christ a
   refuge for your guilty spirit! I am come, then, to exhort you to flee
   to Jesus now!

   Let me pick out one of you, to be a specimen of all the rest. There is
   a young man here who is guilty. The proofs of his guilt lie close at
   hand. He knows himself to be a great transgressor--he has foully
   offended against God's Law. Young man, young man, as you are guilty,
   the avenger of blood is after you! Oh, that avenger--God's fiery
   Law--did you ever see it? It speaks words of flame! It has eyes like
   lamps of fire! If you could once see the Law of God and mark the dread
   sharpness of its terrible sword, you might, as you sat in your pew,
   quiver almost to death in horror at your impending doom! Sinner, I
   think if this avenger shall seize you, it will not be merely temporal
   death that will be your portion--it will be death eternally! Sinner,
   remember, if the Law of God lays its hands on you, and Christ does not
   deliver you, you are damned! Do you know what damnation means? Say, can
   you tell what are the billows of eternal wrath and what the worm that
   never dies are? What the Lake of Fire, what the Pit that is bottomless
   are? No, you cannot know how dreadful these things are! Surely, if you
   could, Man, you would be up on your feet and fleeing for life--eternal
   life! You would be like that man in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress who put
   his fingers in his ears and ran sway! And when his neighbors ran after
   him, he cried, "Eternal life! Eternal life!"

   O stolid stupidity! O sottish ignorance! O worse than brutal folly that
   makes men sit down in their sins and rest content! The drunk still
   drinks his bowl--he knows not that in its dregs there lies wrath. The
   swearer still indulges in his blasphemy--he knows not that, one day,
   his oath shall return upon his own head! You will go your way and eat
   the fat, and drink the sweet, and live merrily and happily, but, ah,
   poor Souls, if you knew that the avenger of blood was after you, you
   would not act so foolishly! Would you suppose that the man, after he
   had killed his neighbor, and when he saw the avenger coming, would
   coolly take his seat and wait to be slain, when there was a city of
   refuge provided? No, that consummate folly is reserved for such as you
   are! God has left that to be the top stone of the folly of the human
   race, the most glittering jewel in the crown of free will--the dress of
   death wherein free will does robe itself. Oh, you will not flee to
   Christ, you will stay where you are, you will rest contented and, one
   day, the Law of God will seize you--and then wrath, eternal wrath, will
   lay hold upon you! How foolish is the man who wastes his time and
   carelessly loiters when the city of refuge is before him, and the
   avenger of blood is after him!

   Suppose, now, I take another case. There is a young man here, who says,
   "Why, Sir, it is no use my trying to be saved. I shall not think of
   prayer or faith, or anything of that sort, because there is no city of
   refuge for me." Suppose that poor man, who had killed his neighbor, had
   talked like that? Suppose he had sat still, folded his arms and said,
   "There is no city of refuge for me." I cannot imagine such folly! And,
   surely, you do not mean what you said just now! If you thought there
   was no city of refuge for you, I know what you would do--you would
   shriek, and cry, and groan!

   There is a kind of despair that some people have which is a sham
   despair. I have met with many who say, "We do not believe we could ever
   be saved," and they seem not to care whether they are saved or not. How
   foolish would the man be who would sit still and so let the avenger
   slay him because he fancied there was no entrance for him into the
   city! But your folly is just as great and even worse, if you sit still
   and say, "The Lord will never have mercy on me." He is as much a
   suicide who refuses the medicine because he thinks it will not cure
   him, as the man who takes the knife and stabs himself in the heart! You
   have no right, Sir, to let your despair triumph over the promise of
   God! He has said it and He means it--"Whoever shall call on the name of
   the Lord shall be saved." If He has shown you your guilt, depend upon
   it, there is a city of refuge for you! Run to it! Run to it! May God
   help you to take yourselves to it now! Oh, if men only knew how
   dreadful is the wrath to come and how terrible will be the Day of
   Judgment, how swiftly would they flee away to Jesus! There is not a
   hearer of mine here who would delay an hour to flee to Christ if he did
   but know how fearful is his condition out of Christ! When God the Holy
   Spirit once convinces us of our sin, there is no stopping, then! The
   Spirit says, "Today, if you will hear His voice," and we cry, "Today,
   Lord, today, we hear Your voice!" There is no pausing, then! It is on,
   on, on, for our very life! I beseech you, my Hearers, you who have
   sinned against God, and know it--you who want to be delivered from the
   wrath to come--I beseech you, by Him that lives and was dead, flee to
   Christ!

   Take heed that it is to Christ you flee, for, if the man who had slain
   his neighbor had fled to another city, it would have been of no avail.
   Had he fled to a place that was not an ordained city of refuge, he
   might have sped on with all the impetuosity of desire and yet have been
   slain within the city gates. So, you self-righteous ones, you may flee
   to your good works, you may flee to your baptism and your
   confirmation--and your church or your chapel attendance--you may be all
   that is good and excellent, but you are fleeing to the wrong city and
   the avenger of blood will find you, after all! Poor Soul! Remember that
   Christ Jesus the Lord is the only Refuge for a guilty sinner--His
   blood, His wounds, His agonies, His sufferings, His death--these are
   the gates and walls of the city of salvation! But if we trust not in
   these, without a doubt, trust where we may, our hope shall be as a
   broken reed and we shall perish after all!

   I may have one here who is newly awakened, just led to see his sin, as
   if it were the corpse of a murdered man lying at his feet. It seems to
   me that God has sent me to that one individual in particular. Man, God
   has shown you your guilt and He has seat me to tell you that there is a
   Refuge for you! Though you are guilty, He is gracious! Though you have
   revolted and rebelled against Him, He will have mercy on all who repent
   and trust in the merits of His Son! He has bid me to say to you, "Flee!
   Flee! Flee!" And, in God's name, I say to you, "Flee to Christ." He has
   bid me warn you against delays. He has bid me remind you that death
   surprises men when they least expect it. He has bid me assure you that
   the avenger will not spare, neither will his eyes pity--his sword was
   forged for vengeance, and vengeance it will have! God has also bid me
   exhort you, by the terror of the Lord, by the Day of Judgment, by the
   wrath to come, by the uncertainty of life and by the nearness of death,
   to flee to Christ this very moment--

   "Hasten, traveler, hasten! The night comes on! And you far off from
   rest and home, Hasten, traveler, hasten!"

   But, oh, how much more earnest is our cry, when we say, "Hasten,
   Sinner, hasten!" Not only does the night come on, but, look, the
   avenger of blood is close behind! Already he has slain his
   thousands--let the shrieks of souls, already damned, come up in your
   ears! Already the avenger has worked wonders of wrath--let the howling
   of Gehenna startle you, let the torments of Hell amaze you! What? Will
   you pause with such an avenger in swift pursuit? What? Young man, will
   you stop this night? God has convinced you of your sin--will you go to
   your rest once more without a prayer for pardon? Will you live another
   day without seeing to Christ? No, I think I see signs that the Spirit
   of God is working in you and I think I hear what He makes you say, "God
   helping me, I give myself to Christ even now! And if He will not, at
   once, shed abroad his love in my heart, this is my firm resolve--no
   rest will I find anywhere till Christ shall look on me and seal, with
   His Holy Spirit, my pardon bought with blood."

   But if you sit still, young man--and you will do so, if left to your
   own free will--I can do no more for you than weep for you in secret.
   Alas for you, my Hearer! Alas for you! The ox led to the slaughter is
   more wise than you are! The sheep that goes to its death is not so
   foolish as you are! Alas for you, my Hearer, that your pulse should
   beat a march to Hell! Alas that yonder clock, like the muffled drum,
   should be the music of the funeral march of your soul! Alas! Alas that
   you should fold your arms in pleasure when the knife is at your heart!
   Alas! Alas for you, that you should sing and make merriment when the
   rope is around your neck and the fatal drop is about to be given to
   you! Alas for you, that you should go your way and live joyfully and
   happily, and yet be lost! You remind me of the silly moth that dances
   round the flame, singeing itself for a while and then, at last,
   plunging to its death--such are you! Young woman, with your butterfly
   clothing, you are leaping round the flame that shall destroy you! Young
   man, light and frothy in your conversation, joyful in your life, you
   are dancing to Hell! You are singing your way to damnation and
   promenading the road to destruction! Alas! Alas! Alas that you should
   be spinning your own winding-sheets--that you should, every day, by
   your sins, be building your own gallows--that by your transgressions
   you should be digging your own graves and working hard to pile the
   firewood for your own eternal burning! Oh, that you were wise, that you
   understood this, that you would consider your latter end! Oh, that you
   would flee from the wrath to come!

   O my Hearers, think of the wrath to come, the wrath to come! How
   terrible that wrath is! These lips dare not venture to describe it! At
   the very thought of it, this heart fills with agony! O my Hearers, are
   there not some of you who will soon be proving what the wrath to come
   really is? There are some of you who, if you were now to drop dead in
   your pews, must be damned. Ah, you know it! You know it! You dare not
   deny it! I know you know it! As you hang down your heads, you seem to
   say, "It is true. I have no Christ to trust to, no robe of
   righteousness to wear, no Heaven to hope for!" My Hearer, give me your
   hand! Never did father plead with son with more impassioned earnestness
   than I would plead with you. Why do you sit still when Hell is burning
   almost in your very face? "Why will you die, O house of Israel?" O God!
   Must I yearn over these people in vain? Must I continue to preach to
   them and be "a savor of death unto death" to them and not "a savor of
   life unto life"? And must I help to make their Hell more intolerable?
   Must it be so? Must the people who now listen to us, like the people of
   Chorazin and Bethsaida in the days of our Lord, have a more terrible
   doom than the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah? O you who are left to
   your own free will to choose the way to Hell--as all men do when left
   to themselves--let these eyes run down with tears for you because you
   will not weep for yourselves!

   It is strange that I should feel more concern for your souls than you
   do for yourselves. My God knows there is not a stone that I would leave
   unturned to save each one of you. There is nothing that human strength
   could do, or human study could learn which I would not seek after if I
   might but be the instrument of saving you from Hell! And yet you act as
   though it concerned you not, whom it should concern the most. It is my
   business, but it is far more yours. Sirs, if you are lost, remember
   that it is yourselves who will be lost! And if you perish, bear me
   witness that I am clear of your blood. If you flee not from the wrath
   to come, forget not that I have warned you. I could not bear to have
   the blood upon my head which some, even of those who like sound
   doctrine, I fear, will have at the last day of account! I tremble for
   some I know who preach God's Gospel, in some sense idly, but who never
   warn sinners. A member of my Church said to me lately, "I heard
   So-and-So preach-- he is called a sound-doctrine-man. I listened to him
   for nine years and I was attending the theater all the time. I could
   curse, I could swear, I could sin and I never had a warning from that
   man's lips during the whole nine years."

   Ah, me! I would not like one of my Hearers to say that concerning my
   preaching. Let this world hiss me! Let me wear the coat that sparkles,
   and the cap that garnishes a fool! Let earth condemn me and let the
   fools of the universe spurn me, but I will be free from the blood of my
   Hearers! The only thing I seek in this world is to be faithful to my
   Hearers' souls. If you are damned, it will not be for lack of faithful
   preaching, nor of earnest warning. Young men and maidens, old men with
   gray heads, merchants and tradesmen, servants, fathers, mothers,
   children--I have warned you this night--you are in danger of Hell! And,
   as God lives, before whom I stand, you will soon be there unless you
   flee from the wrath to come! Remember, none but Jesus can save you! But
   if God shall enable you to see your danger and give you Grace to flee
   to Christ, He will have mercy upon you and the avenger of blood shall
   never find you! No, not even when the red lightning shall be flashing
   from the hands of God in the Day of Judgment! His City of Refuge shall
   shelter you forever! And in Heaven with Jesus, triumphant, blessed,
   secure, you shall sing of the blood and righteousness of Christ who
   delivers penitent sinners from the wrath to come. God bless and save
   you all! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 CORINTHIANS 10:1-14.

   Verses 1-4. Moreover, brethren, I would not that you be ignorant how
   that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the
   sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and
   did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same
   spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed
   them; and that Rock was Christ. The history of Israel in coming out of
   Egypt was a very instructive type of the history of the visible Church
   of Christ. They were in slavery in Egypt as all men are in bondage to
   sin and Satan. They were brought out of Egypt as all the redeemed are
   delivered by the almighty Grace of God. With a high hand and an
   outstretched arm, the Lord brought Israel out of the house of bondage
   and, by a very wonderful Baptism, "in the cloud and in the sea," they
   commenced their career as God's separated people. Then they all shared
   in the same spiritual ordinances--"They did all eat the same spiritual
   meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink." Yet, for all that,
   they were not all God's people. They were so nominally and visibly--but
   they were not all really so. And, as there was a mixed multitude that
   came up out of Egypt, together with the true Seed of promise, so is
   there an alien element in every Church at this present day. Among those
   who have been baptized into Christ, there are still some who, while
   they eat the spiritual meat and drink the spiritual drink, yet for all
   that have not been brought into true communion with Christ and do not,
   in reality, know the Lord.

   5. But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
   overthrown in the wilderness. There was no evidence of faith in many of
   them and, "without faith it is impossible to please God." Is it not a
   sad thing that in a people so highly favored as they were, there should
   have been so large a proportion of those who had not the faith which
   renders men pleasing to God? So they did literally come out into the
   wilderness to die there--and they never entered into the rest of God.

   6. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we. We professed
   Christians--we, Church members.

   6. Should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. They gave
   way to their carnal appetites. They craved for meat when God had
   already given them angels' food. Now, if we act like this, we cannot be
   pleasing to God.

   7. Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
   The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. That is, to
   go through those unclean rites and ceremonies before their idols which
   are here called, "play." Ah, dear Friends, may God keep us from the
   worship of anything which we can see with our eyes, or hear with our
   ears! May we never become idolaters! You know we can very easily make
   idols of our children. We can make idols of our own persons! We can
   make idols of our talents, of our respectability and so forth. But, oh,
   it matters not what the idol is--it is no more pleasing to God if it is
   of silver and gold than if it were of the mud of the river.
   No--"Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them."

   8. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
   fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Fornication in God's people
   is peculiarly black and filthy. In the ordinary man of the world, it is
   evil enough, but when a man professes to be a Christian, he must flee
   from even the very thought of it, and keep himself chaste, for his body
   is a temple of the Holy Spirit. Oh, may none of us ever come anywhere
   near to this great evil, but in purity of heart may we walk before our
   God!

   9. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted Him, and
   were destroyed by serpents. I cannot stay to mention the many ways in
   which we can tempt Christ, but we can still readily do so. What a
   dreadful doom it was to be destroyed by serpents! Yet is it not amazing
   that in connection with this great sin, and its awful punishment, the
   bronze serpent was lifted high, that whoever looked at it might live?
   And now, if any have tempted Christ by presumptuous sin, by their
   delay, or by their infidelity, let them bless God that they are not yet
   destroyed by serpents because Christ has been lifted up even as the
   serpent of brass was exalted above the camp of Israel! Remember our
   Lord's words to Nicode-mus--"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whoever
   believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."

   10. Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were
   destroyed by the destroyer It is a dreadful habit to get into--that of
   complaining against God. Occasional murmuring is doubtless sinful, but
   habitual murmuring becomes a very great evil! I am afraid that there
   are some who quibble at God's Providence and at His Word till they come
   to be quibblers and nothing else! And what good is a man who can do
   nothing else but carp, quibble and criticize? O Beloved, "neither
   murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the
   destroyer."

   11. Now all these things happened to them for examples. They were like
   a book in which we might read our own history in large characters. We
   see ourselves foreshadowed in them and we read our happiness or our
   misery in their behavior.

   11, 12. And they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of
   the world are come. Therefore let him that thinks he stands take heed
   lest he fall For if he begins to think that he stands, it may be that
   it is nothing but his own imagination--there may be no real standing
   about it. And there is no surer sign of the falsity of a man's estimate
   of himself than the fact that it is a high one. He that thinks himself
   good has not begun to be good, for the door of the palace of wisdom is
   humility, and the gate of the temple of virtue is lowliness of mind.

   13, 14. There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
   but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what
   you are able; but will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape,
   that you may be able to bear it Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from
   idolatry. I would like to see this verse put over the top of every
   "sacramental" table in every "church" in England--"Therefore, my dearly
   beloved, flee from idolatry." If this text were properly understood,
   every crucifix would be broken to pieces and the altars, themselves,
   would be cleared away to make room for what should be there--the Table
   of the Lord--and we would have no more worship of visible things, which
   is idolatry! O you who are the dearly-beloved of God, flee from it!
   Keep as far from it as you can.

   I remember reading of a man of God who was the rector of a certain
   parish and who had in the church a very ancient and famous painted
   window of which he was somewhat proud. In the design there was a
   representation of the Godhead--the Father was there, and oh, how
   blasphemous! He was represented as an aged man! And, one day, this
   clergyman, who had seen no evil in the window, heard a rustic
   explaining to a companion that that was the God whom they worshipped.
   The rector did not hesitate for a moment, but he threw a stone right
   through that part of the painted window. I suppose that was an offense
   against the law of man, but certainly it was not against the Law of
   God! He would never have that figure replaced on any account, whatever,
   and I think that he did well! "Dearly Beloved, flee from idolatry." Put
   it out of your sight! Do not tamper with it, but hate it with a perfect
   hatred! In God's eyes, it is one of the most fearful of sins. He has
   said, "I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God," and He will have
   nothing to come between us and the pure and simple worship of His own
   invisible Self.

Watching to See

   (No. 2622)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 14, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   26, 1882.

   "I will stand my watch, and set myself on the tower, and will watch to
   see what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am
   reproved. And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and
   make it plain on tablets, that he may run that reads it For the vision
   is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not
   lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will
   not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him:
   but the just shall live by his faith." Habakkuk 2:1-4.

   I KNOW that, on Thursday nights, there is a large number of friends
   here who are engaged in the work of the Lord, and sometimes it is meet
   to address them, mainly, because, if the bread be put into the hands of
   the disciples, they will pass it on to the multitude. In the day of
   battle, if the command is given to the officers, they will repeat it to
   the various sections of the army, and so the whole mass shall be moved
   forward with one aim and objective. Habakkuk was, like ourselves,
   called of God to labor for the good of the people among whom he dwelt.
   He was one of the later Prophets who came to warn God's ancient people
   before the Lord meted out their last terrible measure of chastisement.
   He saw, in vision, his country given up to the Chaldeans, and he
   pleaded with God about the matter. He had a burden on his heart which
   pressed very heavily upon him. He saw the nation crushed beneath the
   oppressors and he asked, "Why is this?" The Lord replied, "Because of
   the iniquity of the people." Habakkuk understood that, but then it
   occurred to him that the Chaldeans, who were treading down the people,
   were themselves far greater sinners--that, certainly, in the matter of
   oppression and bloodthirstiness, they were a far more guilty people
   than those whom they came to punish! So he used this fact partly as an
   argument with God that He would withdraw the Chaldeans and overthrow
   them. And partly he set it before the Lord as a difficulty which
   troubled his mind. He said, "You are of purer eyes than to behold evil,
   and cannot look on iniquity: why look You upon them that deal
   treacherously and hold Your tongue when the wicked devours the man that
   is more righteous than he?" Habakkuk was puzzled, as David had been
   before him, and as many a child of God has been since. He felt as if he
   could not do his work rightly, so, in his perplexity, he came to
   consult God concerning it. And having laid the case before the Lord, he
   made use of the memorable and instructive words which we are now to
   consider under the gracious guidance of the Holy Spirit.

   I. So, first, dear Friends, we shall notice, in our text, THE ATTITUDE
   OF THE LORD'S SERVANT.

   That is expressed in the one word, "watch." When you are puzzled--when
   you are troubled, when you do not know what to do, then may God help
   you to say, "'I will stand my watch, and set myself on the tower, and
   will watch to see what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer
   when I am reproved." Before we can do any real service for God, we must
   first of all receive our commission from Him. We cannot teach others
   aright unless we are, ourselves, taught of God--and His truest servants
   are those who continue waiting upon Him that they may receive from Him
   the words which afterwards they are to speak to the people in His name.
   Habakkuk is a model to us in this respect. Troubled in heart, he
   resolves to set himself to watch his God and to listen for the message
   he is afterwards to deliver.

   We learn from him that the attitude of the Lord's servant towards God
   is, first, an attentive attitude. "I will stand my watch, and set
   myself on the tower, and will watch to see what He will say unto me."
   If we have a deaf ear towards our Lord, we must not marvel if He gives
   us, also, a dumb tongue. If we will not hear what God speaks, we may
   not expect to be able, ourselves, to speak in His name. Or, if we pour
   forth a flood of words, yet we may not expect that they will be such as
   He will approve and bless. O dear Friends, if we would work for God in
   the right spirit, we must begin as Jesus did, of whom it was written in
   prophecy long before He came to the earth, "The Lord God has given Me
   the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in
   season to him that is weary: He wakens morning by morning, He wakens My
   ears to hear as the learned. The Lord God has opened My ears and I was
   not rebellious, neither turned away back." In the fullness of time,
   Jesus came forth and taught to others what he had thus learned in
   secret, and, if we would teach others, we must first be taught by the
   Spirit of God.

   How much more we might know if we were only willing to listen to the
   Lord's messages! There is, in the Word of God, a voice which is often
   inaudible because we are so engrossed with other things. There is,
   also, the voice of the Christian ministry which oftentimes speaks to
   us, but it is like the cry of one in a wilderness--it is not heard by
   us. There is, too, a voice in God's Providence. How much the Lord says
   to his flock by every stroke of his rod and by every blessing of His
   daily Providence! There is a voice from every grave--a message in every
   bereavement when friends are taken away. There are voices everywhere
   speaking to those whose ears are open. Above all, there is the blessed
   Spirit always waiting to communicate to us the things of God by that
   soft mysterious whisper which none know but those who are, themselves,
   spiritual--and which they know at once to be the very voice of God
   within their spirits. Brothers, we must be attentive! We must not allow
   a single sound from the Lord to escape us. Some men seem God must speak
   thunder and lightning before they will ever hear Him, but His true
   children sit at His feet that they may catch the slightest movement of
   His lips and not let a single syllable from the Lord fall to the
   ground. The attitude of the Christian worker must be one of attention.

   But, next, it must be a patient attitude. Observe what Habakkuk says,
   "I will stand my watch." Not merely, "I will be upon my watch for a
   moment," but, "I will take my place like a sentinel who remains on
   guard until his time of watching is over." Then the Prophet puts it
   again, "I will set myself on the tower"--as if he took his position
   firmly and resolutely upon the tower, there to stand and not to stir
   till he had seen and heard what God the Lord would have him see and
   hear. Do you think, dear Friends, that we are sufficiently resolved to
   know our Master's will? Do we frequently enough get upstairs alone and,
   with our open Bibles, search out what God would have us learn? And do
   we pray over the Word till we have wormed ourselves into the very heart
   of the Truth of God--till we have eaten our way into it, as the weevil
   eats its way through the shell, and then lives upon and in the kernel?
   Do we do this? Do we set ourselves upon the tower, determined that we
   will not go forth to speak for the Lord till the Lord has spoken to us,
   lest we go upon a fool's errand, to deliver our own inventions, instead
   of proclaiming the message that comes from God Himself? Your attitude,
   my Brother, if you are a servant of the Lord, is that of attention and
   patience. To which I may add that it is often a solitary attitude. "I
   will stand my watch." The Church has gone to sleep, but, "I will stand
   my watch." Like flocks of sheep, they lie all around us, the multitudes
   of souls for whom we have to care, but there are still shepherds
   keeping watch over their flocks by night, to whom the Glory of the Lord
   is often revealed when the sheep perceive it not. The city lies wrapped
   in slumber and no sound is heard among her ten thousand sleepers, but
   there is one who knows no sleep, nor gives slumber to his eyelids, for
   he is the appointed watchman of the night and he keeps to his tower and
   sets himself in his place, firmly resolved that till the morning breaks
   there shall be somebody to keep guard over the city. Well, sometimes, I
   say, watchmen have to be quite alone. O Brothers, it would be better
   for us if we had more solitude! It often becomes necessary to us
   because we cannot find kindred spirits that can watch with us a single
   hour. The higher you get up in the Church of God, the more solitary you
   will be. For the sheep, there are many companions, but even for an
   under-shepherd, there are but few. As for that Great Shepherd of the
   sheep, the Chief Shepherd and Bishop of souls, the Good Shepherd, you
   know that His most favored Apostles could not watch with Him even one
   hour, but He had to endure His terrible agony in Gethsemane alone. And
   such of His servants as He honors most will know best what is the
   meaning of Gethsemane, the olive press and the solitude which often
   accompanies the stern watch that the faithful servant of God must keep.

   Never mind if all others around you say that you are hot-headed,
   zealous, enthusiastic, foolish and I know not what! Say to yourself, "I
   will stand my watch." What if they should think that you carry things
   much too far and have too much religion, or are too consecrated? Reply,
   "I will set myself upon the tower, and will still watch, for that is my
   business even if I must attend to it alone." The man who has God for
   his Companion has the best of company! And he that is a solitary
   watcher for the Most High God shall, one day, stand amidst yon shining
   legions of angels, and he will, himself shine forth as the sun in the
   Kingdom of his Father. Expect, therefore, if you are a servant of the
   Lord, to sometimes have to watch alone--and be thankful for that
   position if God honors you by calling you to occupy it!

   Observe, further, that the attitude of the child of God who is called
   to be a prophet to his people--as I know that many of you are--is one
   in which the mind must be entirely engrossed. The true servant of the
   Lord thinks of nothing else than this--"I will stand my watch, and set
   myself on the tower, and will watch to see what the Lord will say unto
   me." He is wholly taken up with that one matter! Many of you have your
   secular callings to follow, but, without neglecting them, you can
   still, in spirit, be watching and waiting to hear the voice of God, for
   God speaks to us not only when we are in the study, or kneeling in
   prayer by our bedside, but He has ways of talking with us while we are
   going along the road and so He makes our hearts to burn within us. He
   can speak with us in the thick of the greatest throng and, perhaps,
   some of us were never more conscious of the voice of God than amid the
   rushing of ten thousand spindles, or in the midst of the crowded
   street! At such times, the noise and turmoil of this busy world have
   not been able to drown the gentle voice of God within our spirit. May
   you, Beloved, be thus engrossed! If you intend to serve the Lord, give
   your whole soul to the learning of His Truth and the hearing of what He
   has to say to you, that you may afterwards be able to tell to others
   what you have, yourselves, been taught of God.

   Observe, also, that the Prophet was entirely submissive to the will of
   God. He put himself into this attitude, that he might hear whatever God
   would say to him, and that his only thought, all the while, should be,
   "What shall I answer when I am reproved?" We need to be, as much as
   possible, like clean white paper for God to write upon. Our mind is
   often far too much occupied and too prejudiced to receive a clear
   impression of the will of the Lord. How many make up their mind as to
   what they will see in a text and so they never learn what the passage
   would teach them if it were allowed to speak freely to them. If you
   would serve God, say to your soul, "I will stand my watch, and set
   myself on the tower, and I will give both my ears and all my heart to
   understand what God would have me know, and to learn what He would
   teach me." May this be the happy privilege of us all!

   The last remark I will make upon this first head is that the attitude
   of the Lord's servant was eminently practical The Prophet did not watch
   and wait merely that he might know the secrets of the future, or be
   able to prophesy, or show his wonderful knowledge. No, but he wanted to
   know what he should answer when he was reproved. He knew that when he
   went out into the world, men would begin to reprove him for being a
   Prophet--they would rebuke him for his zeal and his earnestness! And so
   he waited that he might have the right answer to give, with meekness
   and fear, to all who opposed him. That should be your wish and mine,
   Beloved, for, if we serve God faithfully, we are sure to meet with
   objectors. Well, if this opposition is only against us, it does not
   matter much, but, alas, sometimes their critical and cruel remarks are
   against the Truth of God itself, and, worst of all, against our blessed
   Lord! In such a case it is well to have something with which we can
   stop the mouths of the snarling dogs. It is a blessing to have heard
   God's voice, for, if you repeat the message He speaks to you, even the
   echo of God's voice will break the rocks in pieces and cause the cedars
   of Lebanon to split in two! There is nothing that can stand against the
   Word of the Lord! In the 29th Psalm, David says, "The voice of the Lord
   is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty" and, if we have
   heard that voice, and know how, by the power of the Holy Spirit, to
   echo its mighty tones, they will strike the objector dumb! And even
   when he hates the Truth of God, he will still be compelled to feel what
   force there is in it. So the servant of the Lord says, "I will watch
   and wait to hear what God will say to me, for then I shall know what to
   answer when I am rebuked and reproached for the Truth's sake."

   This, then, is to be the attitude of the children of God. Get away to
   your watchtowers, Brethren! Get away to your tower by the brook Jabbok
   and wrestle with the Angel! Get away to the top of Carmel and put your
   head between your knees and cry unto the Lord until the heavens are
   covered with clouds, and the thirsty earth is refreshed with rain! "The
   effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much," but they who
   do not hear God's voice cannot effectually pray, for God will not hear
   their voice if they will not hear His. If we have been deaf to Him, He
   will be deaf to us. The communion necessary to prevailing prayer
   renders it absolutely essential that we should first set ourselves to
   hear the voice of God and then, again, it shall be said that the Lord
   listened to the voice of a man, for the man first listened to the voice
   of the Lord!

   II. The second part of our subject is, THE WORK OF THE LORD'S SERVANT.

   We have seen what Habakkuk's attitude was. The next verse tells us
   about his work--"The Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and
   make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that reads it." It was not
   long before the waiting Prophet heard God speak and if you and I wait
   upon Him, it will not be long before we hear something that will be
   worth our waiting for and, especially, we shall receive plain
   directions as to our duty!

   Habakkuk was, first, to see the vision. The first name for a Prophet
   was, "a Seer." You, my Brother, cannot be a teller of the good tidings
   of salvation unless you are first a seer. Mind that you see well all
   that is to be seen. Use your eyes to the best advantage and also to be
   able to see what God sets before you. It is curious how the different
   senses are mingled in these verses. Did you notice the expression in
   that first verse, "I will watch to see what He will say unto me"? When
   God speaks to us, we can hear with our eyes as well as with our ears.
   There is an inner sense which sees the meaning of the Lord's language,
   and the inner ear hears the very tones in which that meaning is
   expressed. So, the Prophet was first to be a seer--he was to wait to
   see what God would say unto him.

   Then, next, he was to "write the vision," that is, to make it known
   and, Beloved, when you and I have seen or heard anything which God has
   revealed to us, let us go and write it down or make it known by some
   other means. God has not put the treasure into the earthen vessel
   merely for the vessel's own sake, but that the treasure may afterwards
   be poured out from it, that others may thereby be enriched! You have
   not been privileged to see, merely to make glad your eyes, and to charm
   your soul--you have been permitted to see in order that you may make
   others see--that you may go forth and report what the Lord has allowed
   you to perceive. God does not usually favor His servants with visions
   that they may keep them to themselves. Paul hid for 14 years one that
   he saw, but he was obliged to let it out at last and, I suppose, that
   if he had had more visions, he would not have been able to keep that
   one concealed so long. John no sooner became the seer of Patmos than he
   heard a voice that said to him, "Write." He could not speak to others,
   for he was on an island where he was exiled, but he could write--and he
   did. And, often, he who writes, addresses a larger audience than the
   man who merely uses his tongue. It is a happy thing when the tongue is
   aided by the pen of a ready writer and so gets a wider audience and a
   more permanent influence than if it merely uttered certain sounds and
   the words died away when the ears had heard them. The first thing which
   you have to do, if God has called you to serve Him, is, after hearing
   what He has said to you, to make it known to somebody else--"Write the
   vision."

   And take care, dear Friends, that, in the spreading of the Truth of
   God, you use as permanent a means of doing so as you can. "Write the
   vision," that is to say, if you cannot write with a pen, if you have
   not that special gift, yet write it on men's hearts! Do not merely
   speak it, but seek to reach the inmost soul of your fellow beings and,
   by the power of the Holy Spirit, write the Truth there! God help you
   not merely to sound it in their ears, but to write it on the fleshy
   tablets of their heart--and to leave the Truth of God deeply engraved
   upon their memory! I have sometimes been greatly favored in this way.
   Indeed, it has often been the case, for I almost daily meet with
   persons who say, "We remember hearing you preach more than 20 years
   ago, and we remember what you said." And they will quote something
   which they then heard. I remember visiting, in one of our hospitals, a
   man who had heard me years before. He said to me, "While I was lying
   here, one night, I thought I heard the very tones of your voice"--and
   he told me some similes that I had used when he listened to me. I am
   glad to be successful in producing permanent impressions upon my
   Hearers, but I wish I could be more so. Mr. Jay used to say that in
   preaching, we must say things that will "strike and stick." It is well
   when we can do so and I urge you, who are the servants of the Lord, to
   be sure that when you teach the Truth, you so teach it that it shall be
   permanently learned under your instruction. "Write the vision...upon
   tablets."

   Then the next duty of the servant of God is to "make it plain." I have
   sometimes thought that certain ministers fancied that it was their duty
   to make the message elaborate--to go to the very bottom of the subject
   and stir up all the mud they could find, there, till you could not
   possibly see them, nor could they see their own way at all. I could not
   help, the other morning, comparing some preaching to a boy who was in
   front of me, one summer's day, wanting a penny, and sweeping the
   crossing for me in such a fashion that he enveloped me in clouds of
   dust in order to clear my way! Have I not seen preachers do just the
   very same thing? They tell people all the difficulties they have
   discovered in the Bible--which difficulties most of their Hearers would
   never have heard of unless their ministers had told them--and they
   raise a cloud of dust in order to make a pathway for a poor troubled
   soul! We would rather that they let the dust lie still, for we,
   ourselves, raise enough dust without their help!

   "Write the vision, and make it plain." I suggest that as a motto to you
   who preach in the open air and to you who speak in the lodging houses
   or anywhere else. "Make it plain." It is wonderful how plain we must
   make the Gospel before some people will be able to understand it. They
   have no idea what we mean by many of the expressions that we use. The
   most common language among Christians is often an unknown dialect to
   worldlings--they cannot make heads or tails of it. You and I, speaking
   together of our Christian experience, perfectly understand one another,
   but if we were to say the same things outside to the majority of the
   people, we might just as well preach to them in Dutch! If you have a
   loaf of bread and you want to feed a hungry child with it, it is
   hopeless to try to put that loaf of bread inside the child just as it
   is. Crumble it up, Brother, crumble it up as small as you can! And pour
   over it some of the nice warm milk of your own hearty love--and in that
   way the child and the loaf will come into contact before long! There is
   no way of getting many great Truths of God in the lump into most
   people's minds--we must break them up into small pieces, or, to use the
   words of the text, when we "write the vision," we must "make it plain."

   Another important point is to make it practical I have heard this text
   misquoted a great many times, "that he that runs may read it." Kindly
   look at the passage and see whether that is correct. It does not say,
   "that he that runs may read it," but it does say, "that he mayrun that
   reads it." That is a different thing and that is what we want to see.
   But I have known some people who have had the Gospel delivered to them
   and they have slept that heard it! There has been something about the
   prophet's very tone, and voice, and manner that has tended to fill the
   ears with somniferous influences. "Ah," said one to me, "I cannot help
   believing in mesmerism and so would you if you could see how our
   minister mesmerizes the people all round the gallery every Sunday! They
   can sleep soundly enough after he has been preaching a little while."
   Now, dear Brothers, if we want to do any good to our fellow creatures,
   we must hear God's voice ourselves-- and that will not send us to
   sleep, but it will wake us up! and then we must go and tell the people
   very plainly what we have heard, and also tell it to them so earnestly
   "that he may run that reads it." I believe that I could easily make
   some of you run if I were to take up a telegram from the table and
   read, "Mr. So-and-So's house is on fire. He is requested to hurry home
   as fast as possible." Away he would go down the aisle as soon as the
   words were out of my mouth! You see, that message is something that
   concerns him personally, something that may mean great peril to his
   property, so he runs that reads it, or hears it read! I wish I could
   always preach about the wrath to come in such a way that every unsaved
   man who heard me would take to his heels and run for his life from the
   City of Destruction! Or that I could so speak about the glories of
   Heaven and the preciousness of Christ, that men would straightway run
   to Him, even to the Holy One of Israel, whom God has glorified! Let us
   always try to write on men's hearts in a good running hand, that he
   that reads the message may at once begin to run to escape from judgment
   and to find the Savior and to enter into eternal life!

   There, child of God, is your attitude, and there is your work.

   III. Now, in the third place, the next verse brings out our difficulty,
   that is, THE TARRYING OF TRUTH, "for the vision is yet for an appointed
   time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait
   for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry."

   We preach a Gospel whose chief glory lies in the future. The blessings
   which we proclaim have a most important bearing upon the present, but
   the stress and emphasis of them relate to the future and, therefore, it
   is that, oftentimes, men reject our testimony because, to them, the
   time is not yet, or they doubt its truth because they do not at once
   see the results produced which we foretell.

   Brethren, every promise of God's Word has its own appointed time of
   fulfillment and every doctrine or privilege has its own allotted hour.
   There is an election of Grace, but we shall not know all who are
   included in it till we shall meet the whole company of the faithful at
   the right hand of God! There is a redemption by blood, but the fullness
   of that redemption will not affect these mortal bodies until the
   trumpet of the Resurrection has sounded out its mighty blast over land
   and sea! Then shall we see how Christ has redeemed the bodies as well
   as the souls of His chosen ones. Take any blessing that you please and
   the same rule applies. Although there is much in the Covenant of Grace
   to be enjoyed, today, there is much more that is yet to come.

   The servant of God is still a prophet. He says, "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved"--that is a prophecy! He says,
   "Cast your burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain you"--that is a
   prophecy! He says, "They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion,
   which cannot be removed, but abides forever"--that is a prophecy! He
   says, "The hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall
   hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto
   the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
   resurrection of damnation"--that is a prophecy! And the testimony of
   Jesus is still the spirit of prophecy and each prophecy has an
   appointed time in which it will be fulfilled.

   And, further, it is absolutely certain to be fulfilled. There is no
   word which God's servant rightly speaks for his Lord which will not
   come true. Ye have not followed cunningly-devised fables and,
   therefore, you need not speak your Master's message as though you were
   old wives rehearsing the gossip of a country village! You are telling
   what God the Holy Spirit has revealed in the Word and applied to your
   own soul--therefore, tell it boldly! Now, then, you are ambassadors for
   Christ, as though God did beseech sinners by you, and you are to go and
   pray them, in Christ's stead, to be reconciled to God! Do you not see,
   dear Brothers, the position you are to take up? May you be helped to
   take it up! You are a prophet and your prophecy has a time for
   fulfillment--and it is absolutely certain to come to pass!

   But, sometimes, it apparently tarries. You tell men of the blessedness
   that comes of true religion and they say, "There is such-and-such a
   Believer who is very sorrowful." "Oh, yes," you reply, "in his case the
   vision is tarrying." "There is such-and-such a child of God who does
   not enjoy the Light of the Lord's Countenance." Just so. We did not say
   that he always would, but we do say that he will, one day, walk in the
   Light of God. "Ah," says one, "I have been seeking the Lord for years,
   but I have not obtained peace and comfort." Just so--He did not promise
   that you would obtain the blessing immediately. It may be that, for a
   while, you shall "walk in darkness, and see no light," to test your
   faith. But, though the vision may seem to tarry, it will not really
   tarry--it will come in God's good. time. Oh, how often have you and I,
   struggling to live by faith and to glorify God, geo into a maze and we
   have said, "We shall get out of it." But we did not get out of it for a
   long time. "Oh," we have said, "surely God will deliver us!" Yet, for a
   while, He did not deliver us. We even got into still worse trouble than
   before and then the arch-enemy began to whisper--

   "The Lord has forsaken you! Your God will be gracious no more"-- and
   what little faith we had began to waver, for we said, "We did not think
   that we should be tried like this! We thought we would come out of the
   darkness much sooner than this." But now, Brothers and Sisters, in
   looking back upon those past exercises and experiences, what do you say
   of them? Did the Lord tarry, after all? "Well," you reply, "He tarried
   as I would like Him to always tarry--

   'He hid the purpose of His Grace, To make it better known.'

   He allowed the clouds to collect more thickly to give all the heavier
   shower of blessing, by-and-by. He did permit me to begin to sink. He
   did let me nearly go down, but it was only to make me know how weak I
   was, that I might the more firmly cling to His hand when He plucked me
   out of the waves and bade me stand still by His side."

   I can personally say, at the present moment, that I would not like to
   have had one ache less, or one depression of spirit less, or one
   affliction less of any sort. I would rather not have any more--as
   everybody says--but yet I am glad that my "rathers" count for nothing
   with God and that I have not any permission or need to manage for
   myself! How much better everything is arranged by Him! As for the past,
   it is all right and, blessed be His holy name, it has been so right
   that it could not be better! It has not only been good, but it has been
   better. Yes, it has been best of all! So shall every child of God find
   it. You may say, "This life of faith is difficult. This hanging on so
   long, almost by one's eyelashes--will it not soon come to an end?" The
   end will come at the right time--

   "Godis never before His time: He is never too late."

   Remember how Israel went out of Egypt at the appointed time? It is
   written, "And it came to pass the same day, that the Lord did bring the
   children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies," and on
   that same day when Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Grace shall know that
   it is better for you to be delivered, you shall be delivered to the
   praise of the glory of God's Grace!

   IV. The fourth verse gives us our last point, but I will only just hint
   at what I would have said if there had been more time. THIS TARRYING OF
   TRUTH BECOMES A TESTING OF THE PEOPLE because that Gospel which we are
   to tell does not bring forth all its fruit at once to those who hear
   us. What then? Why, this is the winnowing-fan, this is the sieve, this
   is the way by which God discerns between the righteous and the wicked!

   As for the wicked man, he says, "I do not see any present good coming
   out of religion. Look at that poor, miserable, sighing, groaning,
   poverty-stricken Christian over there! What good has his religion ever
   done him? I do not believe in it." Just so. Now we know who and what
   you are, for our text says, "His soul which is lifted up is not upright
   in him." He is so proud that he judges God's Word and condemns it! He
   will not have Christ to reign over him. He will not believe God. He
   will not wait for God and the reason is that his soul is not upright in
   him. Follow him home and you shall see, in his life, that his soul is
   not upright in him. The man who judges God is one whom God will judge
   and who shall not be able to stand in the Day of Judgment. I will not
   say that every man who rejects Christ is necessarily immoral, but I
   will say that, in nine cases out of ten, it is so and that when you
   trace an infidel's life, there is something there that accounts for his
   infidelity. He wants a cover on his unbelief for that is something he
   has good need to cover! There is something about his daily walk that
   does not agree with holiness--some darling sin that spoils his hope of
   being saved as a Christian. So he tries, as much as he can, to get a
   hope out of lies, out of contradicting God. "His heart is not upright
   in him."

   But how does this test discern the righteous? Why thus--"The just shall
   live by his faith." You know that a Christian, a holy man, a just man,
   a justified man talks thus--"Yes, if God has spoken anything, it is
   true. If God has said that, it will be fulfilled. I will wait. Troubles
   may multiply, cares may come like a deluge, but I will wait. I am sure
   that God is true and I will wait and watch for the unfolding of His
   purposes. Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. I will never give
   up reliance upon Him." Now, that man is a just man, and that is the man
   who will live! It is always well when these three things go
   together--righteousness, faith, life. They ought not to be found apart.
   They should always be together.

   "The just man"--that is, the righteous man--"shall live." Ah, there is
   no true life without that righteousness! "Shall live by his faith"--and
   there is no true life without faith and no true righteousness without
   faith. These three go together--may we all have them and may it be your
   joy and mine to keep on telling others what God has revealed to us,
   that we may thus gather out His own believing people, His elect and
   redeemed ones, while the graceless will, perhaps, despise and hate what
   they may see and so will ripen for the flames of Hell! God grant, of
   His Grace, that they may yet be delivered, for our Lord Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HABAKKUK 2:1-11.

   Verse 1. I will stand my watch, and set myself on the tower, and will
   watch to see what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I
   am reproved. ' 'I shall look to God and I shall also look to myself.
   There shall be an expectation as I gaze upward to my Lord and there
   shall also be an examination as I look within at my empty, guilty,
   good-for-nothing self."

   2. And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it
   plain upon tablets, that he may run that reads it. The Prophets were
   accustomed to write their messages upon wax tablets and the Lord bade
   Habakkuk thus write what he had seen. God would have both His Law and
   His Gospel plainly revealed to men so that they might know and
   understand His will. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "We use great
   plainness of speech." And the Lord would have all His servants do
   likewise. It is not for us to bury the Gospel under a mass of fine
   words, but to set it forth in the simplest and clearest possible
   language--for it is not the power of human words that God blesses, but
   the Truth, itself, as it is applied to the heart by His Spirit.

   3. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
   speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will
   surely come, it will not tarry. Is that a contradiction--"Though it
   tarry...it will not tarry"? No. To us it appears to tarry, but, in
   God's way of reckoning, it does not really tarry. To our impatient
   spirits it seems long in coming, but God knows that it will not be a
   moment beyond the appointed time.

   4. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the
   just shall live by his faith. This grand text was quoted by Paul when
   he wrote his Epistles to the Romans, the Galatians and the Hebrews. It
   proves that Old Testament saints understood New Testament life! David
   and Abraham lived by faith, even as Paul and Peter and the other
   Apostles did.

   5. Yes also, because he transgresses by wine, he is a proud man,
   neither keeps at home, who enlarges his desire as Hell, and is as
   death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathers unto him all nations, and
   heaps unto him all people. This was spoken of the Chaldeans, an
   ambitious nation so exceedingly greedy that it seemed as if the whole
   world would not be large enough to satisfy their voracious appetite.
   Their great kings enlarged their mouths like Gehenna and they seemed as
   insatiable as the very jaws of Death itself. They heaped up nation upon
   nation to make a huge empire for themselves.

   6. Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting
   proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increases that which is
   not his? How long? And to him that loads himself with thick clay! That
   which is said of ambition may also be said of covetousness. What an
   idle task it is for a man to go on perpetually hoarding--heaping
   together more than he can possibly enjoy, as if it were made for nobody
   but for one man, and he must grasp all the wealth of the world. There
   is scope enough for the loftiest ambition when you seek the nobler joys
   of Grace. There is room for a sacred covetousness when you "covet
   earnestly the best gifts," but, in every other respect may these two
   things--ambition and covetousness--be always thrust far from us!

   7. Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite you, and awake that
   shall vex you, and you shall be for booty unto them? So it happened to
   Chaldea that the nations which they had spoiled, by-and-by, grew strong
   enough to take vengeance upon them and to spoil them in their turn.
   Usually, when men do wrong, it comes home to them sooner or later. The
   chickens they hatch come home to roost at night, at any rate, if not
   before. Towards the end of life, a man begins to gather the fruit of
   his doings, or, if he does not reap it in this world, certainly he will
   in the world to come.

   8. 9. Because you have spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
   people shall spoil you; because of men's blood, and for the violence of
   the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. Woe to him that
   covets an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on
   high, that he may be delivered from thepower of evil! He fancies, when
   he gets rich by oppressing others, that he will, himself, rise out of
   harm's way. He says that he will make the main chance sure. He who has
   plenty of gold fancies that he will be able to preserve himself from
   sorrow, but this is what God has to say about that matter--

   10, 11. You have consulted shame to your house by cutting off many
   people and have sinned against your soul For the stone shall cry out of
   the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it These
   Chaldeans were great builders, as we know by the vast ruins that still
   remain. And most of their buildings were erected by labor exacted from
   the people whom they oppressed. They received no wages for their work,
   so even today, from the ruins, the stone cries out of the walls and the
   beams out of the timber answers it. Let all men know that, sooner or
   later, God will execute justice even upon the greatest nations! If they
   will be destroyers, they shall be destroyed. Their evil policy shall,
   by-and-by, sweep them away. "There is a something in the world," says
   one, "that makes for righteousness." Indeed there is, only it is more
   than a something--it is God himself who is always working in all things
   towards the vindication of His own righteous and holy Law.

How Faith Comes

   (No. 2623)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 21, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 2, 1882.

   "And many ofthe Samaritans of that city believed on Him for the saying
   of the woman who testified, He told me all that I ever did. So when the
   Samaritans were come unto Him, they sought Him that He would tarry with
   them: and He abode there two days. And many more believed because of
   His own word; and said unto the woman, Now we believe not because of
   your saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is,
   indeed, the Christ, the Savior of the world." John 4:39-42.

   WHEREVER faith exists, it is the gift of God. It is a plant that never
   sprang up spontaneously from the soil of corrupt human nature. Whether
   it is little faith or great faith, it is equally of Divine origin, and
   wherever it is found-- whether in the child of pious parents who was
   brought up with the utmost care, or in one who has lived all the former
   part of his life in the vilest sin--it is equally and alike the fruit
   of the Spirit and the effect of God's Grace. From this fact I gather
   great encouragement because, if it needs Divine power to implant faith
   in the heart that looks more favorable, it needs no more to implant and
   preserve it in the soul that appears most unprepared to receive it.
   Casting our eyes over the whole map of Palestine, we might have said
   that Samaria was probably as unlikely a place as any in the entire
   country in which we might expect to find followers of the Lord Jesus,
   for, at the very threshold of Christ's announcing Himself, there would
   be found this prejudice, that the Samaritans would not believe in a
   Jew.

   They would not even listen to a Jew, for, while the Jews had no
   dealings with the Samaritans, the Samaritans reciprocated the feeling
   and had no dealings with the Jews. Yet it was among the Samaritans, the
   members of the mongrel faith into which Judaism had deteriorated, that
   Christ was to find a large number of His followers! My Brothers, you
   will be wise to go, first, to those places where there seems to be
   least likelihood of conversions. You will often find that God judges
   not as man judges--"Man looks on the outward appearance"--but God, who
   reads the hearts of men, can see a certain readiness where we reckon
   that there is the most unreadiness! The Lord knows that the soil where
   the Seed of the Kingdom is sown may be in the best condition for
   fruitfulness even when we fancy that it cannot possibly yield us any
   return for our labor. If faith is the work of God--a supernatural
   thing--as it certainly is, what have you and I to do with judging
   according to natural appearances?

   You may go and speak, my Brother, feeble as you feel yourself to be,
   for the Seed owes very little, indeed, to the hand that sows it. And
   you may go, my Brother or my Sister, and scatter this precious Seed
   upon what you may regard as waste soil, but the Seed owes very little,
   after all, to the soil! God can make it spring up like a root out of a
   dry ground and, as of old He brought water out of the rock, and oil out
   of the flinty rock, so can He bring a harvest to His Glory where
   everything seems utterly barren. If it is God's work, let us have no
   doubts, much lese any despondencies, concerning it, but let us continue
   to put ourselves into His hands that He may use us anywhere that He
   pleases, for we know not where He will most glorify His name through
   our feeble instrumentality.

   I am going to talk about faith--faith as it came to these Samaritans.
   And we shall notice, first, faith's annunciation--"Now we believe."
   Secondly, faith's nativity--where it is born. Thirdly, faith's
   upbringing--faith's Nazareth-- for, according to the text, it grows and
   takes higher ground as it develops. "Now we believe, not because of
   your saying: for we have heard Him ourselves." I give these names to my
   three divisions in order to assist your memories.

   I. First, then, I call your attention to FAITH'S ANNUNCIATION. Here we
   have it, in the 42nd verse--"we believe."

   Genuine faith may, through timidity, be hidden for a little while, or,
   possibly, the love of carnal ease may lead some to conceal their faith
   in Christ. But it is of the very nature of faith that it should make
   its appearance known and felt. As Christ had what our Church of England
   friends call His Epiphany, when He was manifested to men, so faith,
   though it may, for a while, be swaddled and laid in a manger, and kept
   in a stable, must have its coming out--it must have its manifestation
   and men must see it! Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea managed, for
   three years or so, to conceal their faith to a great degree. Every now
   and then the light would burn a hole through the bushel, for they could
   not quite hide the fire that was within them, but when Jesus died, then
   the thoughts of many hearts were revealed and both these men stood out
   in the clear light of day as His avowed disciples. They could not help
   it! The occasion had come when their faith must be manifested and they
   must, by their actions, say, "Now we believe." Our Lord has always put,
   side by side with the faith that saves, the duty of confession of that
   faith. His own words are, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." And Paul, guided by the Holy Spirit, wrote, "If you shall
   confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart
   that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the
   heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is
   made unto salvation." Christ loves not a tongue-tied faith--He would
   not have Faith dumb, but would have her speak to the glorifying of her
   Lord on whom she depends! So these Samaritans, when they had come to
   believe in Jesus, must confess their faith and they did so by saying,
   "Now we believe."

   Possibly, dear Friends, they felt some little difficulty--I suppose
   that it was but little in their case--in saying, "Now we believe,"
   because they had previously undergone a period of doubt Evidently these
   people did not receive the woman's testimony, although others had done
   so. They listened to it and were sufficiently moved by it to go out and
   see the Teacher of whom she spoke, but they were not brought to faith
   by it. Perhaps they even battled with her and raised questions--I will
   not say quibbles--but, at last, to her great joy, they said to her,
   "'Now we believe.' We have got out of all the muddle and confusion in
   which we were. We have left the darkness, the doubt and the difficulty.
   And 'now we believe.'"

   Are there any of you, dear Friends, who have been amusing yourselves
   for years with the notion that you were infidels? Have you tried to
   make up, in your own minds, a sort of belief that you were "agnostics"?
   I think that is the favorite word for those who are proud of being know
   as nothings or ignoramuses. Have you tried to bolster up in your mind
   the idea that you were something very amazing in the form of a
   skeptical person--all the while, I doubt not, believing a great deal
   more than you liked to admit--believing and trembling at the same time?
   But have you played that foolish game out and have you now truly
   trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your own Savior? If so, then do not
   be ashamed to say, "Now I believe." You may have to eat your own
   words--well, then, eat them! You may have to be very humble when you
   meet your old friends--well, then, be humble--there will be no harm to
   you in that! And, perhaps, they will bring against you some of your own
   arguments. Well, it will serve you right if they do and, besides, it
   will give you the pleasure of breaking those arguments in pieces and,
   perhaps, of winning your friends for Christ, for you have seen those
   fallacies broken in your own case and you may be the means, in the hand
   of God, of breaking the bow and cutting the spear in sunder in the case
   of those who have been your fellow doubters!

   Do not be ashamed of confessing your past folly. I think a man who
   says, "I was wrong," really says, in effect, "I am a little wiser,
   today, than I was yesterday." But he who never admits that he has made
   a mistake and who claims that he has always been in the right, has
   evidently never made much growth in knowledge of himself. So, do not be
   ashamed to say, "Now I believe," though that confession may have been
   preceded by many a doubt.

   And do not hesitate to say it to the person who has, up to now, been
   baffled by you. I expect the tears were in that poor woman's eyes when
   she said to the men, "You remember what sort of person I used to be,
   and you see the change that has been worked in me. You know that I
   always spoke straight out what I believed, and this blessed Man, who
   read my very soul, is the Christ! I know He is. Then, why do you not
   believe what I say about Him?" I should not wonder if she pleaded very
   hard with them, and prayed, and entreated them to believe her
   testimony. And now, at last, when they did believe, it was due to her
   that they should cheer her heart by saying, "Now we believe." And, even
   though they had to add, "not because of your saying," that
   qualification would not grieve her. "Oh," she would say, "so long as
   you believe, I do not mind how you came into that happy condition! I
   would have been glad if God had used my saying to bring you to faith,
   but, inasmuch as He blessed the saying of the great Preacher, the Lord
   and Master, Himself, I am the more glad on that account, for He will
   have all the glory of it and, so long as you do but believe, you give
   gladness to my heart."

   There are some of you, dear Friends, to whom I have preached in vain
   for a long while and God knows that when I have been laid aside, I have
   often felt a holy joy in my heart at the thought that the man who has
   been preaching for me will be blessed by God to some who have never
   been converted under my ministry. Sometimes, when I have longed to be
   fishing for souls, but could not even stand and, therefore, had to lie
   at home in pain, it has been my hope that some other fisherman would
   throw the fly better than I might have done, and that you would take
   the bait from him, though you have often refused it from me. And when
   you come forward to join the Church, and say to me, as many have done,
   "Sir, we believe, but it was through Fullerton and Smith's mission,"
   or, "it was through the teaching in the Sunday school," or, "it was
   through the agency of someone who spoke to us in the aisle," I am sure
   that I have been just as glad and happy as if you had told me that it
   was by my own personal testimony that you had found the Lord. Glad,
   indeed, am I to be the instrument of saving souls, but still, if you
   are saved, the instrumentality by which that blessed result is reached
   is, after all, a very small matter! But, when you do really believe in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, take care that you tell us, for we have wept
   over you and prayed for you. And when you are converted, it seems but a
   fair and honest recompense that you should say to the individual whom
   God has honored to be your spiritual parent, "Now we believe." By doing
   so, you will strengthen and encourage him to go on with his work more
   earnestly than before! Perhaps you will even stave off a heartbreak and
   make the Christian sower fill his hands the fuller and scatter the seed
   more deftly because he knows that he has not labored in vain, nor spent
   his strength for nothing!

   In this annunciation of faith, I want you to observe, also, that it was
   very speedy. The Lord Jesus Christ was only in that place for two days,
   so that those who said, "Now we believe," must have testified very
   speedily after they believed. I do not think that it is the duty of
   people to wait several months before they come forward and confess
   Christ--it may sometimes be the wisdom of the officers and members of
   the Church to say to some persons, "We would like to see a little of
   your life, that we may judge by your fruit, before we receive you into
   fellowship." It may even be their dutyto say that, and to keep them
   waiting outside the Church for a while to test their genuineness, but
   it is not the duty of the candidate, himself. His business is, as
   speedily as may be convenient after he has believed in Jesus, to
   confess his faith and to seek to be baptized and added to the Church.
   You do not find Paul waiting several months, after he was converted,
   before he was baptized. You see, in Scripture, no trace of what our old
   people in the country used to practice, namely, "summering and
   wintering" converts, to see what they were like before they permitted
   them to make a confession of their faith in Jesus. No, no--if you have
   believed in Him, come along with you!

   The next step is to say so, and to say it as quickly as you can, "Now
   we believe." If tonight you are brought to faith in Jesus Christ, I
   would say to you, find some Christian Brother and tell him at once that
   you have believed in Jesus. When this precious child of the Spirit of
   God, namely, Faith, is born, let it be known to the King's house that
   it has come! In Heaven they make such blessed tidings known for, "there
   is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that
   repents." Though it is but the initial stage of faith, hold not the
   glad news back from the Church of God, but let it be speedily
   proclaimed, "Now we believe." What a joyous moment it is when any can
   say, "Now we believe!" It is the end of suspense--it is the end of the
   kingdom of darkness, it is the end of fear, it is the end of
   despair--it is the dawn of hope, it is the dawn of Heaven! Oh, what a
   world of meaning there is in those three words! What glory is opened up
   to the poor tearful eye by faith! What sights are visible when we can
   say, "Now we believe!"

   O my dear Hearers, can you all say, "Now we believe"? If you can do so,
   truthfully, you can say a greater thing than Cicero or Demosthenes,
   with all their eloquence, ever uttered! Have you been seekers for
   months and years? Have you been tempest-tossed and driven up and down
   upon the sea of doubt? May you now cast your anchor overboard into the
   depths of Jehovah's love and when you find that it holds, may you cry
   out, with ecstasy, "Now we believe!" There, then, is the annunciation
   of faith.

   II. Now, very briefly, I want you to look, in the second place, on
   FAITH'S NATIVITY. How does faith come into men's hearts?

   According to the plain teaching of Scripture, "Faith comes by hearing,
   and hearing by the Word of God." But faith is not always created in the
   human heart by the same form of instrumentality. It is always the fruit
   of the Spirit of God but it comes in different ways. Some of these
   Samaritans believed because of the saying of the woman and, I suppose
   that in the Christian Church, a very large number derive their faith
   through the power of God's Spirit, from the personal witness of others
   who have been converted. Now look, dear Friends, all of you, at this
   woman, and be encouraged to use your personal testimony for Christ! She
   was the spiritual mother of many a Samaritan believer, yet she was a
   woman of bad character. An ill savor was about her name--everybody in
   Sychar must have looked upon her as a dangerous person of fickle love
   and of foul ways--and yet, after she had found Christ, she did not
   hesitate to tell her neighbors about Him--and God did not refuse to
   bless her testimony! I believe that there are thousands of persons whom
   no man would ordain, but who are ordained of God, for all that--and
   there are many whom we would say that the Church could not employ, whom
   the great Head of the Church employs, and employs grandly, too! What if
   you have been converted from great sin? Be careful and watchful that
   you sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you, but let not shame
   with regard to the past make you ashamed to confess the Christ of the
   present, and to acknowledge that He has worked a great work upon you!
   Here was a poor fallen woman and yet, after her conversion, she became
   a missionary of Christ to the city of Sychar! She was, altogether,
   quite an unofficial person. She does not appear to have been called a
   sister of mercy, or to have put on any peculiar garb, but she ran
   straightway to the people with whom she had lived and, perhaps, to the
   very men with whom she had sinned! She went to tell the story that
   Christ had come to her and had given to her that Living Water, of
   which, if a man shall drink, he shall never thirst again! Well,
   Believer, if no man sends you, go all the same, for Godsends you!
   Perhaps no man has laid his hands upon you, but of what use is the
   laying on of hands? Full often I fear it is only empty hands laid on
   empty heads--so, if no man has laid his hands on you, go without the
   laying on of hands, in the name of Him who has laid His pierced hands
   upon you and said to you, "Fear not, for I am with you: be not
   dismayed, for I am your God: I will strengthen you, yes, I will help
   you, yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness."

   If you ask, "What shall my message be?" let your message be your own
   personal testimony--what you have, yourself, seen, heard, tasted,
   handled and felt of the good Word of God. I do not suppose that this
   woman arranged her discourse under three heads, or that she had an
   introduction and a conclusion and all that, but she just went to the
   men of the city and said, "Come see a Man who told me all things that I
   ever did--is not this the Christ?" That was her little sermon and as
   often as she repeated it over and over again, she spoke out and bore
   her personal testimony--and so she brought the men of Sychar to Christ.
   "Go home," said Christ to one whom He had healed, "go home to your
   friends and tell them how great things the Lord has done for you, and
   has had compassion on you." It is amazing how attractive a personal
   narrative is! If you begin to explain to some people the doctrines of
   the Gospel, your audience will diminish one by one. But tell them your
   own experience of the power of Christ and they will listen as listened
   the wedding guest when "the ancient mariner" laid his hand upon him,
   detained him and told him that strange legend of the sea! You will have
   attentive hearers when you speak about your own dealings with Christ,
   the wonders that Christ has worked in you and for you, and of which you
   can testify because they are your own experience! That is, in many a
   case, the nativity of faith. The mother tells her child, the husband
   tells his wife, the brother tells his sister and, more often, still,
   the sister tells her brother. One man communicates it to his
   co-workers--a gentleman speaks of it in the drawing room to those of
   his own class--and so faith is born in other hearts as the result of
   the personal testimony of Believers!

   But, dear Friends, there are some persons who do not seem as if they
   would ever be converted by that means. Personal testimony evidently
   fails with them as it did with some of these Samaritans. What, then,
   remains? Why, it will suffice if personal testimony leads the way and
   excites attention to the subject! Then, if the man is wise, he asks for
   time and thought--and our Lord Jesus is always ready to attend to those
   who are anxious about spiritual matters, but are not quick to believe.
   Two days did He remain in Sychar and those unbelievers who were candid
   sat at His feet and heard Him through the two days. Now, what did Jesus
   preach during those two days? Turn to your New Testaments and find the
   sermon. Even though you look very carefully, you will not discover it,
   for it is not there! And it is a very curious thing that when the woman
   preached, we have notes of her sermon, but when Christ preached, we are
   not told what He said. Very remarkable is it that, frequently, we have
   those discourses of Christ which did not convert anybody and we have
   not those discourses which didconvert people! Why is that? I suppose
   that the Holy Spirit gives us the discourses which were rejected in
   order to let us see that there was no fault in the sermon, but that the
   fault was in the people. But as for those that were received, He simply
   tells us the result and does not state the particular form of the
   discourse. I would infinitely rather preach sermons that win souls and
   are then forgotten, than go on preaching and having my discourses
   printed from week to week, and hear of no results! Happily, I have not
   to choose either alternative, but these people who were not persuaded
   to believe by the witness of the woman, were converted through hearing
   Christ, Himself.

   "Well," says one, "but we cannot personally come to Christ right now."
   No, I know that you cannot, but you can do what is very much like it. I
   recommend every man who finds faith to be a difficult thing, to
   carefully read through the four Gospels, asking the Holy Spirit to
   enable him to believe what is recorded and revealed there. I usually
   find that the greatest doubters are the people who do not read the
   Bible. Holy Scripture has within itself a mighty convincing power--and
   when men lie soaking in it, it soon penetrates into their very souls! A
   man says, "I cannot believe," and yet he does not read or hear about
   the very thing that is to be believed! He keeps out of the way of it
   and yet says, "I cannot believe it." If there is something in the
   newspaper today, about which you felt compelled to say, "Other people
   seem to believe it, but, somehow, I am unable to do so--I would be very
   glad to believe it, but I cannot"--what would you do? You would read
   the statement again! You would refer to any other account that would be
   likely to confirm it. You would candidly examine the whole affair to
   see whether it was true or not. Yet how few--how very, very few have
   thus come to Holy Scripture, itself, and virtually listened to Jesus,
   Himself, and then have gone away and still said, "We do not believe."
   Unless they are really given up to hardness of heart, the result, in
   every case, seems to be that when they search the Scriptures, and seek
   to know what Christ did and said, they are soon subdued by His sweet
   power and are found sitting at His feet, believing in His name! If
   anybody has not done this and yet remains an unbeliever, I charge his
   unbelief upon himself as his own fault and sin. If I will not examine
   the evidence, I am to blame if I do not believe the

   Truth of God!

   Do you ask, "What evidence shall I examine?" I say again, examine the
   documents themselves! Let Christ speak for Himself. "Had I not better
   read a, 'Life of Christ'?" Listen, there is no, "Life of Christ,"
   extant but the one written by the four Evangelists. All the attempts
   that have been made at lives of Christ, whatever value they may have,
   are not biographies of Christ! They are somebody's idea of what He may
   have been. We need no other, "Life of Christ," than the fourfold one
   given to us in the Gospels! Those Inspired Evangelists have told us all
   we ought to wish to know. And if you read those Books--not men's books
   which have been written upon those Books--I believe that through the
   blessing of God the Holy Spirit, you will yet be able to say, with
   these Samaritans, "Now we believe." God grant that it may be so! It is
   in this way that faith is often born. Holy Scripture is the Bethlehem
   of faith! There is this blessed Child brought forth and happy are they
   who take it, and nurse it, that it may grow.

   III. This is our last point, FAITH'S UPBRINGING, or, as I called it,
   "faith's Nazareth."

   It is possible that there were some of the Samaritans who believed and
   who, when they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your
   saying, for we have heard Him ourselves," meant that they did, at
   first, believe because of the woman's saying, but, after a while, they
   outgrew that first stage of faith and they came to believe in Jesus
   still more strongly because they had heard Him themselves.

   This was a higher form of faith. The beginnings of faith are as a
   spider's web. It would be difficult to say how little a thing faith may
   be at first. I doubt not that many believe the Bible because they were
   always taught by their parents that it is the Word of God--although
   they have never thoroughly examined that question for themselves. Some
   have believed the Truth of God, at first, because their minister
   preached it. Well, I would not discourage even that form of faith, for
   it may be like a very tiny thread which may be fastened to a
   string--and the string may be tied to a rope and the rope be attached
   to a cable--and, at last, the shipwrecked mariner may thus be saved
   from drowning! Anything that links men to Christ may, nevertheless, be
   overruled of God to their salvation. When that woman said, concerning
   our Lord, "If I may but touch His clothes, I shall be made whole," I
   fear that there was some superstition in the notion, but, nevertheless,
   Christ overlooked that and, seeing the real faith that lay hidden
   underneath, took care that it should live. Do not discourage anything
   that tends towards faith in Christ, but it is a grand thing when men
   grow, by God's Grace, till they can say, "Now I do not believe simply
   because of what my dear mother taught me. I do not believe merely
   because of what my minister preached. I do not believe because of any
   human being at all, but I believe because I have heard Christ for
   myself, I have had personal dealings with Him and, now, 'I know whom I
   have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto Him against that day.'"

   The faith that sprang from Christ's own testimony would also be much
   more vivid faith. The other day there was a meeting held to protest
   against the barbarities indicted on our Jewish brethren. All the
   speakers spoke very strongly, but if any one of you had seen what has
   been done and had come fresh from the deeds of blood, I guarantee that
   you would have spoken very intensely, indeed. Your indignation would
   have flamed fiercely if you had seen the homes of the people burned
   down and men murdered and women ravished, for the sight of the
   cruelties and abominations would have affected you far more than merely
   hearing about them! So, when Faith gets to deal with Christ for
   herself--when she sees sin forgiven--when she feels the weight taken
   from her troubles--when she realizes the great possessions of joy which
   Christ has given to her--to her, herself--then she becomes much more
   vivid and truly living than the faith that rests simply upon the
   testimony of others!

   And, Beloved, as our faith becomes more vivid, so, also, it becomes
   more independent. We need more independent Christian people in the
   present day! I hope that we are growing a race of them, here, and I
   pray that we may grow far more of them. I have seen young people and,
   for all that matter, old people, too, behave excellently and seem to be
   admirable Christians while they have lived here in the midst of other
   warm-hearted Believers. But they have gone down into the country to
   live and it has been very grievous to see how cold-hearted they have
   become--how some of them have even, at last, forsaken the assemblies of
   God's House and, if they have not utterly turned aside, yet they have
   been very different from their former selves! Beloved, if you have seen
   Christ and are truly one with Him, you will live with Him when all
   Christian association is withdrawn! Look at many of the houses in our
   London streets. If a giant were to pull one of them out of the middle
   of the row, they would all come tumbling down! They only stand because
   they lean on one another. But Christians should be detached houses--no,
   semi-detached--for they must be attached to Christ--but they ought to
   stand alone, apart from men, because of their living faith in Him!

   This kind of faith has grown beyond that which was at first exercised
   and it has become broader. If you will kindly look at the chapter, you
   will notice that all the woman could tell the men was this, "Come, see
   a Man who told me all things that I ever did--is not this the Christ?"
   But these men had learned more than that, for they had listened to
   Jesus Himself! They wondered, at first, that He, being a Jew, should
   care for them. But, by-and-by, it darted into their mind that He had
   not come to be the Savior of Jews, alone, so they said, "We have heard
   Him, ourselves, and know that this is, indeed, the Christ, the Savior
   of the world." Oh, that was grand, broad faith, when they saw that this
   Christ was not the Jews' Christ alone, but the Christ of the
   Samaritans--the Christ of the Gentiles, too--the Savior of sinners all
   over the world! May your faith and mine, dear Friends, grow broad! May
   we believe for others! May we hope for others! May we expect to see
   God's salvation extending even unto the ends of the earth and, moved by
   this faith, may we be stirred up to go out and find the lost sheep,
   that we may bring them to the Great Shepherd, that He may fold them in
   safety by His tender care! Let us be so much with Christ that we may
   catch His spirit, and that our faith may grow exceedingly, and our love
   to all the saints be increased!

   The Lord give His blessing, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN4:1-42.

   Verses 1-6. When, therefore, the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard
   that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, (though Jesus
   Himself baptized not, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed
   again into Galilee. And He must needs go through Samaria. Then came He
   to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of
   ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there.
   Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus on the well:
   and it was about the sixth hour Do not be surprised, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, if you sometimes grow weary in the Lord's work. I trust that,
   even then, you will not be weary of it, but that you will believe that
   your blessed Master can still use even His tired servants and bless
   their labors. The Lord Jesus Christ worked great marvels even when He
   sat wearily on the brink of Jacob's well--and you, perhaps, are at this
   moment as fatigued and worn as you well can be--yet, will you not
   awaken all the energies of your soul if you should see an opportunity
   of doing good, even if it should be to some poor fallen woman, as in
   the case here mentioned? It is a blessed thing never to be too tired to
   pray and to never be too tired to speak to an anxious enquirer!

   7. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water Providence was at work
   so that when Christ reached the well, this woman was on her way there.
   It was very late in the day for anyone to go to draw water, but,
   probably, the other women, who went to the well early in the morning,
   were not willing to associate with her, so she had to go by herself.
   Late as she was, however, she was all in good time, for she reached the
   spot just when Christ was waiting to bless her!

   7, 8. Jesus said unto her, Give Me to drink (For His disciples were
   gone away unto the city to buy meat). Or else they might have drawn
   water from the well to refresh Him.

   9, 10. Then said the woman of Samaria to Him, How is it that You, being
   a Jew, asks drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have
   no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her, If
   you knew the gift of God, and Who it is that says to you, Give Me to
   drink; you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living
   water. See the deadly mischief of ignorance concerning spiritual
   things? If she had known, she would have asked, and Christ would have
   given! But the first link was missing and, therefore, the rest of the
   chain was not drawn on. Sometimes all that people need is a little wise
   instruction and they will then trust the Savior. God grant that we may
   always be ready to give it! Alas, there are some who need much more
   than that, but Christ could truly say to this Samaritan woman, "If you
   had known, you would have asked, and I would have given." O dear
   Hearers, do not perish through ignorance! You have your Bibles--then,
   search them! You have a Gospel ministry among you--take care that you
   give diligent heed to what you hear from the servants of the Lord!

   11. The woman said unto Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and
   the well is deep: from where, then, have You that living water?Christ
   told the woman that He could give her living water, but it puzzled her
   to know how He could get at it. The well where they had met was deep
   and He had nothing to draw the water out of it--how, then, could He go
   still deeper to get the living water of which He had spoken? She could
   not understand His simile and, to this day, it is the same with many of
   our Hearers. The simplest language of God's ministers goes right over
   the heads of the people. They take our words literally when they ought
   to see that they are spiritual and, on the other hand, I have known
   them spirit them away when they ought to be accepted literally. Such is
   the perversity of man's mind that, often, he will not understand the
   Truth of God.

   12-14. Are You greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well,
   and drank thereof himself and his children, and his cattle? Jesus
   answered and said unto her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst
   again: but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall
   never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
   well of water springing up into everlasting life. These words set forth
   the wonderful nature of Divine Grace! They greatly err who suppose that
   we can receive it and yet, after all, be left to perish without it! No,
   but when it is once imparted to us, it continues to spring up within us
   like a well that never runs dry! It is the living and incorruptible
   seed, "which lives and abides forever." It is of the very nature and
   essence of the Grace of God that it is indestructible--it cannot be
   taken away from the heart in which it has been implanted by the Holy
   Spirit!

   15, The woman said unto Him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
   not, neither come here to draw. This was an ignorant prayer on the part
   of the woman, but it is one which I would commend to every enlightened
   soul--"Sir, give me this water." Do you want a form of prayer? Here is
   one for you! "Sir," Lord--"give me this water." The Lord is ready to
   hear that petition and to give this precious living water even now.

   16, 17. Jesus said unto her, Go, call your husband and come here. The
   woman answered and said, I have no husband. The Lord Jesus knew all
   about her character and here He touched the weakest point in it. His
   plainest teaching had so far missed the mark, for He had not reached
   her conscience--but He was about to do so.

   17, 18. Jesus said unto her, You have weel said, Ihave no husband: for
   you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your
   husband: in that said you truly. You can imagine her astonishment--her
   blank amazement as the secret story of her life was thus repeated to
   her!

   19. The woman said unto Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a Prophet I t
   would have been a sign of better things if she had said, "Lord, I
   perceive that I am a sinner," but that confession had to be made a
   little farther on. How apt people are rather to think about the
   preacher than about themselves! If half the criticisms which are passed
   upon ministers of Christ were bestowed upon the hearers, themselves,
   how much sooner they might receive the blessing they need! The woman
   then asked our Lord a question about religion which was strangely out
   of place from such a woman as she. Yet, often, those who have least
   morality will have the most ceremonialism and concern about the
   externalsof worship!

   20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. This Mount Gerizim--

   20. And You say that in Jerusalem is theplace where men ought to
   worship. This she thought was a very important matter.

   21. Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe Me, the hour comes when you
   shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
   Father ' 'There shall be an abolition of all specially-holy shrines,
   for all places shall be, alike, holy. There shall be a putting an end
   to all your traditions and your forms of worship, for God shall be
   worshipped after another fashion than that which is merely formal and
   superficial."

   22-26. You worship what you do not know: we know what we worship, for
   salvation is of the Jews. But the hour comes and now is, when the true
   worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the
   Father seeks such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they that
   worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. The woman said
   unto Him, I know that Messiah comes, who is called Christ: when He is
   come, He will tell us all things. Jesus said unto her, I that speak
   unto you am He. That majestic word of Christ carried conviction with
   it--the woman believed it then and there!

   27, 28. And upon this came His disciples, and marveled that He talked
   with the woman: yet no man said, What do You seek? or, Why do You talk
   with her? The woman then left her water pot She was too glad, too happy
   to recollect so poor a thing as a water pot! It was much to her before,
   but very little now. As one who finds a precious pearl forgets some
   trifle that he carried in his hands, so she "left her water pot."

   28, 29. And went her way into the city, and said to the men, Come, see
   a Man, who told me all things that I ever did--is not this the
   Christ?Her notion was that when Christ came, He would tell all things.
   Here was a Man who revealed her innermost secrets--was not He the
   Christ?

   30-32. Then they went out of the city and came unto Him. In the
   meantime, His disciples urged Him, saying, Master, eat But He said unto
   them, I have meat to eat that you know not of O Beloved, there is a
   wonderful fascination about the blessed work of soul-seeking! When one
   is really anxious to bring a sinner to the Savior, eating and drinking
   are often forgotten! As the hunter of the chamois, in the heat of the
   chase leaps from crag to crag, and is oblivious of danger, and forgets
   all about the time for his meals, so he that hunts after a precious
   soul, to win it for Christ, forgets everything else! He is altogether
   absorbed in this holy pursuit--the Master was more absorbed in it than
   any of us are ever likely to be.

   33-35. Therefore said the disciples, one to another, Has any man
   brought Him anything to eat? Jesus said unto them, My meat is to do the
   will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work Say not you, There are
   yet four months, and then comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift
   up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white, already, to
   harvest. That was probably an old Oriental proverb, used by lazy men
   who never thought it time to get to work, but Jesus said, "Do not use
   the idler's language any longer. Now, at once, there is work for you to
   do."

   36-42. And he that reaps receives wages, andgathers fruit unto life
   eternal: that both he that sows andhe that reaps may rejoice together
   And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps. I sent you
   to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor: other men labored and you
   are entered into their labors. And many of the Samaritans of that city
   believed on Him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told
   me all that I ever did. So when the Samaritans were come unto Him, they
   besought Him that He would tarry with them: and He abode there two
   days. And many more believed because of His own word and said unto the
   woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard
   Him, ourselves, and know that this is, indeed, the Christ, the Savior
   of the world. The Lord bring us all to trust in Him for His dear name's
   sake! Amen.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 28, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 12, 1882.

   "Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this
   concerning Me?" John 18:34.

   I EXPLAINED this morning, [Sermon #1644, Volume 28--" Our Lord's First
   Appearance before Plate"] why our Savior put that question to Pilate.
   The Roman governor had asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And
   Jesus as good as said to him, "Have you, of your own knowledge, seen
   anything in Me that looks like setting up to be a king in opposition to
   Caesar? You intend, by asking Me that question, to enquire whether I
   have led a rebellion against your government, or the imperial authority
   which you represent. Now, has there been anything which you have
   observed which would have led you to make this enquiry, or do you only
   ask it because of what the Jews have been saying in their enmity
   against Me?" You will see, dear Friends, that our Lord asked this
   question in order that He might get from Pilate's own lips the
   acknowledgment that he had not seen any sign of sedition or rebellion
   in Him and that it might be proved that the charge had been brought to
   Pilate by those outside, and had not come from the Roman governor
   himself.

   We will, now, forget Pilate for a while, for I want to use this
   question in two ways with reference to ourselves. First, I shall
   utilize it as a warning against secondhand quibbles at Christ and His
   Gospel Some people have a large stock of them and we might say to each
   one of these quibblers, "Are you speaking for yourself about this, or
   did others tell you this?" Then, in the second place, I shall use the
   text as a warning against all secondhand religion, pressing this
   question home upon each one who speaks up for Christ, "Are you speaking
   for yourself about this, or did others tell you this?"

   I. We will begin with the opponents of the Lord Jesus and consider our
   text, first, as A WARNING AGAINST SECONDHAND QUIBBLES AT CHRIST AND HIS
   GOSPEL.

   There are a great many people in the world who really do not know why
   they oppose religion--and if you ask them the reason, they repeat some
   old bit of scandal, some stale slander upon Jesus and His Cross--and
   they give that as their answer. I firmly believe that there are
   thousands, who are ranked among the opposers of the Gospel who have not
   anything to say against Christ of their own knowledge, but others have
   told them something or other, and they go on repeating and reiterating
   the old exploded obsolete objections that have been demolished
   thousands of times! And I suppose they and others of their kind will
   keep on doing the same thing right to the end of time.

   As soon as Jesus Christ's Gospel was launched upon the world's sea, it
   had to encounter opposing winds, storms and tempests. Like a scarred
   veteran, the Gospel has had battle after battle to fight. In our Lord's
   own day it was opposed most vigorously. His Apostles found that
   wherever they went, their feet were dogged by those who railed at Jesus
   and His Word. And when the Apostles had all fallen asleep, the early
   Churches found that they had need of an order of men who became the
   apologists for the Gospel and who bravely stood up to defend it against
   the attacks of divers heathen philosophers, skeptics and heretics who
   arose wherever the Truth of God was preached. There was opposition
   everywhere to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ--and His servants
   girded up their loins to do battle for Him and for His Truth.

   That great campaign has continued even down to this day and there is
   this very remarkable fact about it, that, at the present moment, most
   of the objections that are brought against the Gospel are those that
   were answered and silenced some hundreds of years ago! And even when
   they appeared, all those centuries ago, they were then only
   reproductions of some older objections which had been answered and, as
   the defenders of the faith thought, had been trampled out, like sparks
   of fire trodden under foot! But, somehow an ill wind has begun to blow,
   again, and the fire, which some hoped was finally extinguished, has
   burned up once more. Originality in skepticism has almost ceased to
   be--we scarcely ever hear anything fresh in the way of heresy nowadays.
   We are troubled with the very errors which our forefathers answered a
   hundred years ago, yet the adversaries of the Truth of God go on
   cleaning and sharpening their blunted shafts, that they may once more
   shoot them at the great shield of faith which is impervious to their
   puny assaults, for it can quench even the most fiery darts of the devil
   himself! The modern arrows of skepticism will be broken against that
   glorious shield, yet they will probably be gathered up by another
   generation that will follow the present one and the heretics and
   objectors in the future will do just as their fathers did before them.
   I want, at this time, to put to any quibbler whom I may be addressing,
   the question of our Lord to Pilate, "Are you speaking for yourself
   about this, or did others tell you this?"

   And, first, I ask you to observe that there are many unreasonable
   prejudices. Some persons have great prejudices against the Bible. I
   will not repeat what they say, but I would like to ask every person who
   thinks ill of this blessed Book, "Have you read the Bible through, and
   read it thoroughly? Have you studied it? Are your objections your own?
   Come, now, did you make them yourself?" It is almost always found that
   objections are like the axe the young Prophet was using--they are
   borrowed--and often they are objections against a Book which has not
   been read at all, and which has not been allowed to exercise its own
   influence upon the heart and the judgment of the person who is
   prejudiced against it to his own hurt! Other people have told men,
   such-and-such things, so they shut the Book and refuse to look into it
   for themselves.

   There are other people who are prejudiced against public worship. You
   see, I am starting at the very beginning-- those matters with regard to
   religion which are elementary. Of course, we are told that we shut
   ourselves up on Sunday in these dreary buildings of ours, and here we
   sit, in a horrible state of misery, listening to the most awful twaddle
   that ever was taught, our singing being nothing better than droning and
   the whole of our worship being something very terrible! If I were to
   read to you the descriptions of an English Sabbath which I have
   sometimes seen in newspapers, they might make you almost weep tears of
   blood to think that we poor souls should suffer so much as we do! Only
   you know that we are altogether unconscious of any such suffering! We
   really have been under the notion that we very much enjoyed ourselves
   while worshipping the Lord in His House. Many of us have the idea that
   the Sabbath is the happiest day in all the week and that, when we hear
   the Gospel preached, it is sweeter than music to us and makes our
   hearts leap within us for very joy!

   Of course we are very much obliged to our friends for telling us how
   dull and how unhappy we are and for wishing us to be in a better
   condition. We can only say that, not being enabled to perceive any of
   these sorrows, we would advise them to retain their pity and exercise
   it upon themselves--for they certainly need it far more than we do! To
   any of you who make remarks of the kind I have indicated, I ask--"Do
   your difficulties concerning public worship really arise out of your
   attending the House of God, out of your hearing the Gospel
   preached--out of your joining in the songs and praises of God's
   people?" Oh, no! It is those people who never come to our services who
   believe the Sabbath to be dull, the House of God to be dreary and the
   preaching of the Gospel to be a monotonous sound from which every
   sensible man would escape! I put the question of my text to every
   person who is prejudiced against the Bible, and prejudiced against our
   public worship in God's House, "Are you speaking for yourself about
   this, or did others tell you this?"

   Sometimes, the prejudice concerns the preacher. I will not say that it
   is so about myself, though I have had, in my time, more than my fair
   share of it. "Hear him?" says one, "I would not go across the road to
   listen to such a fellow." Many have said that and the preacher, whoever
   he may be, is condemned without a hearing. If the objector were asked
   to give a reason for his prejudice, he might answer by quoting the old
   lines--

   "I do not like you, Dr. Fell. The reason why, I cannot tell, But this I
   know, and know full well-- I do not like you, Dr. Fell."

   I should like to say to everybody who is prejudiced against any servant
   of Christ, "Do you say this of yourself?" Those absurd stories about
   the preacher--did you really hear them, yourself, or did somebody tell
   you them? Would you like to be judged by the mere idle tittle-tattle of
   the street or of the newspapers? And if you would not, then be an
   honest, reasonable man and at least give the servant of God a hearing
   before you condemn him or his message! And, take my word for it, the
   most-abused preacher is very likely to be the very man whom God will
   bless the most! Not the one who is most praised, but the one who is
   most censured by the world, is probably the man who has been most
   faithful to his Master and to the Gospel committed to his charge. At
   any rate, be honest enough to reply to the question which our Lord put
   to Pilate, "Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others
   tell you this?"

   There is a remark sometimes made, and I fear it is a very common one,
   "Oh, I would not be a Christian, I would not be religious, for it makes
   men so dreadfully miserable" Now, Friend, do you say this, yourself, or
   did somebody else tell you? Come, now, you say that religion is such a
   miserable thing--have you tried it for yourself? Have you experienced
   the misery that comes out of prayer--out of faith--out of
   repentance--out of love to God--out of being pardoned-- out of having a
   good hope of Heaven? Have you ever proved what that dreadful misery is?
   I think if you had ever really tested these things for yourself, your
   verdict would be the very reverse and you would join with us in singing
   the lines that express what many of us most firmly believe about this
   matter--

   "'Tis religion that can give

   Sweetest pleasures while we live!

   'Tis religion must supply

   Solid comfort when we die."

   Yet you go on repeating that slander upon religion though you cannot
   prove it to be true and might easily learn its falseness! Let me appeal
   to you. Had you a godly mother? "Yes," you say, "and it was her life
   that prevents my being altogether an unbeliever." I thought so, but, if
   I remember her aright, she was a quiet good soul who, in her home,
   tried to make everybody happy. And though she had not much pleasure in
   her son, for he was wayward and willful, yet there was no unkindness on
   her lips--the law of love always ruled the house. She was a weak and
   feeble creature who derived but slender gratification from any of the
   outward enjoyments of life, but she had a deep, secret spring of peace
   and joy which kept her calm, quiet and happy. And now that she has gone
   to be with God, she has left a gleam of sunlight still behind in her
   sweet memory. You did not get from your mother, nor from other godly
   friends, your belief that religion makes men miserable! And I venture
   to say that, so far as you have had any actual personal observation of
   it, you have been inclined to come to quite the opposite verdict and to
   confess that, though you do not know how it is, yet, somehow or other,
   godliness does give to the people who possess it, peace of mind,
   happiness of heart and usefulness of life.

   There is another slander that is spread abroad very widely, and that is
   that the Doctrine of the Grace of God--the Doctrine which we try to
   preach from this pulpit--has no sanctifying effect. That, on the
   contrary, it is likely to lead people into sin. They say that if we
   preach, "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life," and do not
   preach up good works as the way of salvation, it is clear that such
   teaching will lead people into sin! Clear, is it? It is not so to me!
   But, my Friend, will you answer this question, "Are you speaking for
   yourself about this, or did others tell you this?" Is it not a matter
   of history that there never have been stricter living men than the
   Puritans? What is the great quarrel against John Calvin, himself, but
   that when he ruled in Geneva he was too stern and too exacting in his
   requirements? It is an odd thing--is it not--that these Doctrines of
   Grace should, on the one hand, make men too strict as a matter of fact,
   and yet that the wiseacres who object to them should say that these
   doctrines are likely to lead into sin those who accept them? It is not
   found to be so by those who believe them!

   Let me again appeal to any candid objector. My dear Sir, did you ever
   prove what it is to believe in the great love of God to you--that, for
   the sake of His dear Son, out of pure, unmerited Grace, He has chosen
   you, saved you and appointed you to eternal life? Did you ever believe
   that and then feel, as a natural consequence, that you would go and
   live in sin? I know that you never did, but that it was quite the
   reverse! "Here," said some boys to a companion, "we are going to rob an
   orchard. Come along with us, Jack." "No," he said, "my father would not
   approve of such a thing." "But your father is very fond of you and
   never beats you as our fathers do." "Yes," said the boy, "my father
   loves me very much and I love him very much--and that is the reason why
   I am not going to rob the orchard and so grieve him." Now, you believe
   in the beating of the boys by the rod of the Law, do you not? And we,
   on the other hand, feel that because God loves us and will, in His
   infinite mercy continue to love us, therefore we must keep out of sin
   as much as we possibly can. We cannot do that horrible thing which
   would grieve His blessed Spirit. So I ask you, as truthful men, not to
   repeat that old slander concerning the Doctrines of Grace leading to
   sin until you have really had some reason to assert it because of what
   you, yourselves, have witnessed in the lives of Christian people! Do
   not say it again until you can truly say it from your own experience or
   observation! Do not repeat it simply because others tell you it is so.

   Yes, and there are some who say that there is no power in prayer, that
   we may pray, if we like, but that we cannot change the purposes of
   God--that the laws of nature are fixed and immutable and, therefore, to
   pray is a piece of absurdity. "Are you speaking for yourself about
   this, or did others tell you this?" I will speak personally to you. Did
   you ever try to pray? Did you ever put this matter to the test--whether
   God will hear prayer or not? I do not think you can have put it to a
   fair test and I would like you to see whether God will or will not hear
   even yourprayer if you cry to Him. If any say to me, "God does not hear
   prayer," I have scarcely the patience to give them an answer! I live
   from day to day crying to God for this or that favor which I receive as
   certainly and as constantly as ever my sons had their meals when they
   sat at my table! I knew how to give good gifts to my children and I
   know that my Heavenly Father gives good gifts to me. My evidence, of
   course, is only that of one man--and it may not suffice to convince
   others, though many of you, here, could add your testimony to mine--but
   I should like all objectors just to give prayer a fair trial before
   they are quite so sure about the inefficacy of it. Let them see whether
   real prayer, offered in the name of Jesus Christ, will not be heard
   even in their case!

   I am certain that there is not a praying man anywhere on the face of
   the globe who does not bear this testimony-- that God hears him. And if
   any say, "We do not pray and do not believe that God hears prayer,"
   what evidence have you to bring? You are altogether out of court, for
   you know nothing about the matter! But the man who does pray and then
   says, "God hears me," is the man to be a witness, and the one who has a
   right to be heard. I have told you, more than once, what the Irishman
   said when there were five witnesses to prove that he had committed
   murder. He said to the judge, "You must not condemn me on their
   evidence--there are only five people here who saw me do it--I can bring
   50 people who did not see me do it!" But that was no evidence at all
   and, in like manner, there are many who say, "You bring a certain
   number of people who pray, to prove that God hears them. But we can
   bring ten times as many, who do not pray, and who do not get heard."
   What has that to do with the matter? Where is the evidence? You say it
   not of yourself but merely repeat, secondhand, what has been said by
   others, so often and so foolishly, that it sickens one to hear it!

   It is beginning to be questioned in many quarters, nowadays, whether
   there is any real effect produced by prayer, except that of exciting
   certain pious emotions in the breasts of those who pray. This is a very
   pretty statement! We ought to be extremely obliged to those superior
   persons who allow that even so much may be done! I am amazed they do
   not assert that prayer is ridiculous, or hypocritical, or immoral!
   Their moderation puts us under obligations. And yet I do not know--when
   I look again at their admission, I thank them for nothing--for they as
   good as call us fools! Do they think that we perform a useless exercise
   merely for the sake of exciting pious emotions? We must be grievous
   idiots if we can receive benefit from a senseless function! We are not
   willing to whistle to the wind for the sake of the exercise. We should
   not be content to go on praying to a god who could be proven to be both
   deaf and dumb. We have still some little common sense left, despite
   what our judicious friends consider to be our fanaticism. We are sure
   that we obtain answers to prayer! Of this fact I am certain and I
   solemnly declare that I have received of the Lord that which I have
   asked at His hands. I am not alone in such testimony, for I am
   associated with multitudes of men and women who bear witness to the
   same fact and declare that they sought the Lord and He heard them. Take
   care, Brothers and Sisters, to record all instances of answered prayer
   so as to leave this unbelieving generation without excuse. Accumulate
   the facts and demonstrate the grand Truth of God! Multiply the
   testimonies till even the philosophers are obliged to admit both the
   phenomena and the deduction rightly drawn from them.

   There is one other gross slander to which I would reply, and that is a
   saying that goes round among troubled consciences--that Christ will not
   receive sinners--that the very guilty cannot be saved. They say that
   Christ can forgive and deliver up to a certain point, but if you get
   beyond that, He is no longer willing to pardon. Dear Hearer, has that
   foolish and wicked notion entered your head? Then I ask you, "Are you
   speaking for yourself about this?" Did you ever prove it to be true?
   Have you ever sought His face? Have you cried to Him for mercy? "Yes,"
   you say, "I have." And then, further, have you thrown yourself at His
   feet, trusting Him to save you, and have you been refused? I know you
   have not! There was never a sinner, yet, who fell down before Him and
   determined to lie there and perish if He did not speak a word of mercy,
   to whom the Lord has not, sooner or later, spoken the Grace-word which
   has sent that poor sinner on his way rejoicing! I would at least like
   you to go and see whether Christ will receive you or not before you say
   that He will not do so.

   Say not that the door of His mercy is shut, but go in while it is still
   open! If He casts you out, then He will have broken His word, for He
   has said, "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out." Do not
   call Him a liar and say that He will cast you out till you have,
   yourself, proved that it is so! And that, I know, will never be the
   case. I am afraid that there is another being who has been whispering
   that vile insinuation into your ear--and he is your archenemy who is
   seeking your destruction and, therefore, he has come and told you this
   lie against the infinitely-loving and gracious Savior! Believe him not,
   but come even now and put your trust in Jesus and you shall find that
   He will give you eternal life!

   I have thus examined the question of my text with reference to the
   opponents of the Gospel. I shall now leave that part of the subject,
   praying the Holy Spirit to bless it to all whom it may concern.

   II. Now, in the second place, I am going to speak briefly, but with
   much earnestness, to the many here present who are friends of the
   Gospel, but who have only a SECONDHAND RELIGION, if they have any at
   all. I want to have a word with you, dear Friends, about this matter.
   You and I have been talking a great deal about Christ. Now, have we
   been simply quoting what others have said? Have we been making extracts
   from other people's experience, or is what we have said something that
   we can say of ourselves, and not what others have told us?

   For, Brothers and Sisters, first, a secondhand testimony for Christ is
   a powerless thing. Take a man--as I am afraid is often done--with no
   Grace in his heart and send him to Oxford or Cambridge, with the view
   of making him a parson. Teach him the sciences, languages, mathematics
   and give him a degree. His friends want to get a living for him and the
   bishop's chaplain proceeds to examine him. The first question ought to
   be, Is this young man a Christian? Is he truly converted? Does he know
   the Lord? Does he understand, in his own soul, the things he is going
   to preach to others? For, if he does not, what good can he do in the
   Christian ministry? Perhaps he is sent to a school of theology to learn
   the various systems of doctrine. He must read the judicious Hooker. He
   must study Jeremy Taylor. He must take lessons in elocution and
   rhetoric. Then, possibly, his friends buy him some lithographed sermons
   that he may read and they get him some books, that he may make extracts
   from them to put into the sermons he preaches. Suppose that man is, all
   the while, unconverted? Suppose that he does not know anything about
   the working of the Grace of God in his own soul? What is the good of
   him as a teacher of others? No good at all! At any rate, at the best,
   he may be only as good as one of those newly invented phonographs which
   can repeat what is spoken into them. This man can read out what he has
   selected from other books, but that is all. We will suppose that he is
   a very decent sort of fellow--an amiable gentleman, well-instructed,
   well-behaved and so on--but all that he has to say is what other people
   have told him!

   But now put into that man's pulpit, only for one Lord's-Day, a preacher
   who has known what it is to feel the burden of sin and to have it
   removed by faith in Jesus. Let him begin to speak to the people in
   downright earnest about the pangs and sorrows of true repentance. Let
   him tell them about their need of the new birth and about his
   experience of obtaining that great blessing and how, by Sovereign
   Grace, he was brought out of the darkness into the light, and even from
   death to life. Let that man be moved to speak of the peace of pardon
   through the precious blood and of the joys of Heaven laid up for all
   Believers--and then the people will wake up, I will guarantee you! This
   is something very different from the preaching to which they have been
   accustomed--and they will soon feel the power of it.

   Yet the Lord sometimes uses even a preacher who does not, himself,
   understand the Truth he proclaims. I know a man who went and heard a
   certain minister preach, or rather, read a sermon, and it was such a
   good one that the hearer's conscience was smitten by it. The discourse
   was about the new birth and, the next morning, the man went off to the
   clergyman, and said, "Sir, I want you to explain this matter further to
   me, for I am dreadfully distressed by what you preached last night."
   What, do you think, this preacher said? He said, "Well, Jonathan, I am
   sure I never meant to cause anybody any uneasiness. What was it that
   gave you such trouble?" "Why," he replied, "it was that part of the
   sermon where you said that we must be born again." So the preacher
   said, "Well, here is the discourse. You see, by the dates upon it, that
   I have used it 13 times before, so I could not have made it with any
   special view to your case. I am very sorry, indeed, that it caused you
   any discomfort, and I will never preach it again if it brings people
   into trouble in this style." That was all the help the poor man could
   get from the parson, so he went out and found a true servant of God who
   knew the Truth of God, himself, and was not a secondhand retailer of
   it, and, through conversation with him and prayer, and the reading of
   the Scriptures, he was brought into peace and liberty! I need hardly
   tell you that he does not go to hear that secondhand preacher now! He
   listens to a far humbler minister, who, nevertheless, preaches what he
   has tasted and handled of the good Word of Life.

   Now, if any of you are going to be Sunday school teachers, or
   street-preachers, do not begin to talk about what somebody else has
   told you. Go and say what you, yourself, know, of a heart first broken
   by the power of the Holy Spirit, and then bound up by the application
   of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ! Proclaim your message in a
   living way from the heart to the heart, or else your hearers will feel
   that there is no power about it, however nicely you put the Truth and
   however sweetly you describe it. There is all the difference between
   personal testimony to the Truth of God and a parrot-like repetition of
   it, that there is between the living and the dead! Let us only bear
   witness to what we really know--and then no one will need to ask us
   what our Lord asked Pilate, "Are you speaking for yourself about this,
   or did others tell you this?"

   Now, further, the same thing is true with regard to professors. We have
   many friends who come, at different times, to join the Church, and
   their stories vary greatly. Some who come to see me cannot say much and
   they think that I shall be very dissatisfied with them because they
   make a great muddle of their narrative, and there is not much, after
   all, that comes out. But the people with whom I am least satisfied are
   those who reel off their yarn by the yard--they have it all ready to
   repeat and everything is arranged as prettily as possible! Yes, and as
   I listen to it, I know that someone has told them what to say and they
   have memorized it all for me to hear! But I like far better the
   testimony that I have to pick out in little bits, but which I know
   comes fresh from the heart of the trembling convert! Sometimes it costs
   the poor soul a tear or a real good cry--and I have to go round about
   in all manner of ways to get hold of the story at all--but that shows
   that it is true and that the man never borrowed it. I like to hear the
   experience of a Believer, when he comes straight out of the world and
   out of the ways of sin, to confess his faith in Christ. He does not
   know anything about the terms that Christian people use. He has not
   learned our phrases and it is a great delight to hear it all fresh and
   new. Yet it is always the same story in all the essential parts of it.
   However strangely he may narrate it, it tallies with that of others in
   the main points. Take the experience of a Christian man who has been
   brought up in the sanctuary from his childhood and extract the pith and
   marrow of it. Now take the experience of a man who has been a gambler,
   a drunk, a swearer, but who has been truly converted--and extract the
   pith of that. Talk to a peer of the realm who has become an heir of the
   Kingdom of Heaven and take the pith of his experience. Now get a
   chimney-sweep who has been brought to the Lord and get the pith of his
   experience. Put them all side by side and you will not know one from
   the other! There are always the same essential marks--death, birth,
   life, food--Christ in the death, the life, the birth, the
   food--repentance, faith, joy, the work of the Spirit of God! But it is
   very sweet to hear the story told in the many different ways in which
   the converts tell it. The true child of Grace is always the same in
   heart, although the outward appearance may continually vary.

   But, dear Friends, whenever you begin to make a profession of religion,
   take care that you never profess more than you really possess! Go just
   as far as you can go, yourself, by the Grace of God, and do not repeat
   what others tell you. To borrow another man's experience is dishonest.
   If it is not mine, how dare I say that it is? It is also very apt to be
   self-deceptive, for a man may repeat another person's experience until
   he really thinks he didpass through it, himself, just as a man may
   repeat a lie until it almost ceases to be a lie because he, himself,
   gets to believe what at first he knows was not true! That borrowing of
   the experience of others is usually worthless with those who have had
   much to do with men, for we who do know the Lord and are familiar with
   His people, very readily trip up those who only repeat what they have
   learned! Freemasons recognize one another by various grips and signs. A
   man may, perhaps, find out one of the grips, but he does not learn them
   all and, at last, he gets caught--and people say to him, "You are
   pretending to be what you really are not."

   Take, again, a man's handwriting. Someone may imitate my writing for a
   long while, but, at last, he does not copy some peculiar dash, or
   stroke, or mark which is characteristic of my style. And those who
   know, say, "That is not Mr. Spurgeon's writing--it is a forgery." So
   there is a something--a sort of freemasonry--about Christianity. People
   may learn some of our grips, signs and passwords, but, by-and-by, they
   make a blunder and we say, "Ah, you are an impostor!" They may try to
   write after the fashion of a child of God and they may make the
   pot-hooks, hangers and straight strokes, but, as they get on further,
   there is a something or other that comes out in the long run which
   proves that they are only copyists after all. Therefore, I say to you,
   dear Friends--Do not attempt to repeat what others have told you about
   experimental godliness, but let your testimony only consist of what you
   can truly say out of your own heart and soul!

   Let this be the case, also, with regard to every man, whether he makes
   a profession of religion or not May God grant that all that we think we
   know, we may really know in our own souls and not have because we have
   borrowed it from others! In religion, proxies and sponsors are
   altogether out of place. I pray you never to be guilty of that horrible
   blasphemy--for I think that it is nothing less than that--of standing
   up before God and promising that a child shall keep His Commandments
   and walk in the same all the days of its life! Remember that in
   religion, there are certain things that must be personal. For instance,
   every man must be, himself, born--another person cannot be born for
   you. In like manner, "You must be born again"--personally, for
   yourself! There is no possibility of another person experiencing that
   new birth for you. If a man lives, he must eat for himself. You cannot
   take my meals for me--it is I, myself, who must eat them. And we must
   eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ by faith, each one for
   himself or herself--nobody can do it for another. In daily life each
   man must be clothed for himself. You may wear silk and satin, you may
   be dressed in the best broadcloth, but you cannot be clothed on my
   behalf--I must be dressed myself, or else go naked. So must each man
   put on the robe of Christ's righteousness, or be naked, to his shame,
   before God. Every man must repent of his own sin-- make confession of
   his own sin, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ for himself--love God for
   himself, obey the Lord for himself. There is no possibility of any
   other person, by any means, doing this for you! There must be personal
   godliness, or else there is no godliness at all. So, whenever you feel
   inclined to say for yourself, "I believe that I am a Christian. I
   believe this and I believe that," let this question come home to you,
   "Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you
   this?"

   And, lastly, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, let me utter a word
   specially for your ears. Never get, in your prayers, or in your talk,
   an inch beyond your actual experience. Our calling is a very high one
   and one of the most serious difficulties in the way of ever attaining
   its greatest height is the impression that we have reached it when we
   have not. My own impression is that some Brothers and Sisters might
   have been almost perfect if they had not thought that they were so
   already! But they missed the blessing through that very thought! Many a
   man might have become wise, but he imagined that he had learned wisdom,
   so he was never really wise. You know that if you see a man who thinks
   that he is wise, you say to yourself, "How very foolish he is!" And you
   speak truly, too. The doorstep of wisdom is a consciousness of
   ignorance and the gateway of perfection is a deep sense of
   imperfection. Paul was never so nearly perfect as when he cried, "O
   wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" But if he had sat down and said, "I have attained and am
   already perfect," then would he have been in a fair way of missing the
   blessing of God. No, dear Brothers or Sisters, say no more than you can
   justify. There are many who do that in business--mind that you do not
   so act in spiritual matters! Look at that shop window--what a wonderful
   display! Now go inside the shop. Why, there is nothing there! No, for
   the man has all his goods in the window! You would at once say to
   yourself, if he wanted to deal with you, "I shall not trust him very
   deeply." Ah, and do we not know some who, spiritually, have all their
   goods in the window? It is a grand thing to have a great stock in
   reserve. Never mind if it is in the cellar, where you cannot see it--it
   is none the worse for being out of sight!

   The great thing for all Christians is to have a good background,
   something behind that is real so that, if you pray, or if you speak to
   another, you will be prepared to back it up! I remember trying to be a
   blessing to a very shrewd boy in a Sunday school class when first I
   knew the Lord. I told him the Gospel--"He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." Then he asked me a straight question, "Teacher, have
   you believed?" I replied, "Yes, I hope so." He said, "Don't you know,
   Teacher? You ought to." "Yes," I answered, "yes, I do know. I have
   believed in Jesus." "Well, Teacher," he enquired next, "have you been
   baptized?" I replied, "Yes, I have." "Then," he said, "Teacher, you are
   saved." I said, "I hope so." "But," he insisted, "you are." Just so,
   and I found that I must say so, too--that I must not use even Christ's
   words unless I meant to back them up by my own consistent
   character--otherwise I am throwing suspicion on my Master's
   truthfulness! May the Lord bring us up to this point of Christian
   honesty--that when we cannot truthfully say a thing from our own
   experience, we will be honest enough to resolve, "I shall not say it
   till I can truly say it."

   When you think of a verse of a hymn, and it is a little in advance of
   your own position, wait till you come up to that point. There are
   numbers of hymns that I laid by, in that fashion, years ago. I wished
   that I could sing them, yet they seemed to stick in my throat and I
   could not. But my throat has been cleared a good deal lately, and I
   have been obliged, at last, to feel that I must have those very hymns,
   for they have become true to my soul and have made my experience a very
   happy one. Do not be in too much of a hurry in spiritual things any
   more than in temporal things. If you cannot eat meat, stick to your
   milk. Milk is for babes, so keep to milk till you outgrow it, You will
   choke with that tough bit of meat--you had better leave it for somebody
   else. Do not find fault with it, it is good for strong men, they do not
   need to be always drinking milk. Do not deny the strong man his meat,
   but let him have as much as he likes of it! As for yourself, if you are
   a babe in Grace, keep to your milk diet. But, in all your testimony, do
   not go beyond what is actually true to yourself. Often let my text lay
   its hand upon your shoulder and repeat this searching enquiry, "Are you
   speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this?"

   May God grant a rich blessing to you all, dear Friends, for our Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

The Dumb Singing

   (No. 2625)

   INTENDED FOR READING OR LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 4, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT SHOULDHAM STREET CHAPEL, ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, APRIL 29, 1857.

   "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
   shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the
   tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out,
   and streams in the desert." Isaiah 35:5.

   WHAT a difference Divine Grace makes, wherever it enters the heart! In
   our text we find the blind mentioned, but they are no longer blind when
   once Grace has touched their eyes! "Then the eyes of the blind" are
   "opened." We read also of the deaf, but they are not deaf after Grace
   has operated upon them! "The ears of the deaf are "unstopped." Here are
   men who have been "lame," but when once the Omnipotent influence of
   Divine Grace has come upon them, they leap like a hart! And those who
   used to be speechless, so far from being dumb any longer, have
   experienced a change that must be radical, for its effects are
   surprising. "The tongue of the dumb" not only speaks, but it sings!
   Divine Grace makes a great difference in a man when it enters into him.

   How vain, then, are the boasts and professions of some persons who
   declare themselves to be the children of God and yet continue to live
   in sin! There is no perceivable difference in their conduct from what
   it formerly was--they are still what they used to be before their
   pretended conversion--they are not changed in their acts, even in the
   least degree. And yet they most positively affirm that they are the
   called and living children of God, although they are entirely
   unchanged! Let such people know that their pretensions are lies and
   that falsehood is the only groundwork they have for their hopes, for
   wherever the Grace of God comes, it makes men to differ from what they
   were before. A graceless man is not like a gracious man, and gracious
   men are not like graceless ones--we are "new creatures in Christ
   Jesus." When God looks upon us with the eyes of love and works in us
   conversion and regeneration, He makes us as opposite from what we were
   before as light is from darkness, and as Heaven, itself, is from Hell!
   He works in man a change so great that no mere reformation can even
   imitate it--it is an entire change--a change of the will, of the
   affections, of the desires, of the dislikes and of the likes. The man
   becomes, in every respect, new, when Divine Grace enters his heart. Yet
   you say of yourself, "I am converted," and remain just as you were I
   tell you once again to your face, that you say what is not true--you
   have no ground for saying it! If grace permits you to sin as you were
   known to do, then that grace is not Divine Grace! That grace is not
   worth having which permits a man to be, after he receives it, what he
   was before. No, Beloved, we must always hold and teach the great
   Doctrine of Sanctification. Where God truly justifies, He also really
   sanctifies. And where there is the remission of sin, there is also the
   forsaking of it! Where God has blotted out transgression, He also
   removes our love of it, makes us seek after holiness and walk in the
   ways of the Lord. I think we may fairly infer this from the text as a
   prelude to the observations I have to make concerning it.

   I want you, first of all, to notice the sort of people whom God has
   chosen to sing His praises and to sing them eternally. Then, in the
   second place, I shall enter into a fuller description of the dumb
   people here mentioned. Then, thirdly, I shall try to mention certain
   special times and seasons when those dumb people sing more sweetly than
   at others.

   I. First, then, THE PERSONS WHOM GOD HAS CHOSEN TO SING HIS PRAISES
   FOREVER. "The tongue of the dumb shall sing."

   I ask you, first, to note that there is no difference, by nature,
   between the elect and others. Those who are now glorified in Heaven and
   who walk the golden streets clad in robes of purity, were, by nature as
   unholy, defiled and as far from original righteousness as those who, by
   their own rejection of Christ and by their love of sin, have brought
   themselves into the pit of eternal torment as punishment for their
   iniquities! The only reason why there is a difference between those who
   are in Heaven and those who are in Hell is because of Divine Grace, and
   Divine Grace alone. Those in Heaven would have been cast away had not
   everlasting mercy stretched out its hand and rescued them. They were,
   by nature, not one whit superior to others! They would as certainly
   have rejected Christ and have trod under foot the blood of Jesus as did
   those who were cast away if Grace, Free Grace, had not prevented them
   from committing that sin! The reason why they are Christians is not
   because they did naturally will to be so, nor because they did, by
   nature, desire to know Christ, or to be found of Him--they are now
   saints simply because God made them so! He gave them the desire to be
   saved. He put into them the will to seek after Him. He helped them in
   their seeking and afterwards brought them to feel that peace which is
   the fruit of justification! But, by nature, they were just the same as
   others, and if there is any difference, we are obliged to say that the
   difference does not lie in their favor. In very many cases, those who
   now "rejoice in hope of the glory of God" were the very worst of men!
   There are multitudes who now bless God for their redemption who once
   blasphemed Him--who, as frequently as they dared to do so, implored
   that the curse of God might rest upon their fellows and upon
   themselves! Many of the Lord's anointed were once the very castaways of
   Satan, the sweepings of society, the refuse of the earth! They were
   those whom no man cared for, who were called outcasts, but whom God has
   now called desired ones, seeing that He has loved them!

   I am led to these thoughts from the fact that we are told here that
   those who sing were dumb by nature. Their singing does not come
   naturally from themselves--they were not born songsters. No, they were
   dumb ones whom God would have to sing His praises. It does not say the
   tongue of the stammerer, or the tongue of him who blasphemed, or of him
   who misused his tongue, but, "the tongue of the dumb"--those who have
   gone furthest from any thought of singing, those who have no power or
   will to sing--the tongue of such as these shall yet be made to sing
   God's praises! It is a strange choice that God has made. Strange for
   its graciousness, strangely manifesting the Sovereignty of His will.
   When God resolved to build for Himself a palace in Heaven of living
   stones, where did He get them? Did He go to look for the richest and
   purest marble in the quarries of earthly perfection? No, you saints,
   "Look unto the rock from which you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
   from where you were dug." So far from being stones that were white with
   purity, you were black with defilement, seemingly utterly unfit to be
   built into the spiritual temple which would be the dwelling place of
   the Most High!

   Yet He chose you to be trophies of His Grace and of His power to save!
   Goldsmiths make exquisite forms from precious material. They fashion
   the bracelet and the ring from gold, but God makes His precious things
   out of base material. From among the black pebbles of the muddy pond He
   has taken up stones which He has set in the golden ring of His
   Immutable Love, to make them into gems to sparkle on His finger
   forever! He has not selected the best, but apparently the worst of men,
   to be the monuments of His Grace! And when He would have a choir in
   Heaven that would, with harmonious tongues, sing His praises--a chorus
   that would forever chant hallelujahs louder than the noise of many
   waters and, like great thunders--He did not send Mercy down to seek
   earth's songsters and call from us those who have the sweetest voices!
   No, but He said, "Go, Mercy, and find out the dumb, and touch their
   lips, and make them sing. The virgin tongues that never sang My
   praises, before, that have been silent until now, shall break forth in
   sublime rhapsodies and they shall lead the song--even angels shall but
   attend behind and catch the notes from the lips of those who once were
   dumb."

   Oh, what a fountain of consolation this opens for you and for me! Yes,
   Beloved, if God did not choose the base things of this world, He would
   never have chosen us! If He had regard unto the countenances of men. If
   He were a respecter of persons, where would you and I be this day? We
   would had never been the subjects of His love and mercy! No, as we look
   upon ourselves, now, and remember what we once were, we are often
   obliged to ask our Lord--

   "Why was I made to hear Your voice,

   And enter while there's room

   When thousands make a wretched choice,

   And rather starve than come?" And we have no difficulty in finding the
   right answer in the next verse of the hymn--

   "'Twas the same love that spread the feast,

   That sweetly forced us in,

   Else we had still refused to taste, And perished in our sin."

   Grace is always Grace, but it never seems so gracious as when we see it
   brought to our unworthy selves. Yes, my Friends, you may be Arminians
   in your doctrine, but you can never be Arminians in your feelings--you
   are obliged to confess that salvation is all of Grace and to cast away
   the thought that the Lord chose you because of your foreseen faith or
   good works! We are obliged to come to this point--to feel and know that
   it must have been of mercy, free mercy, and of that, alone--that we
   were not capable of doing good works without His Grace enabling us to
   do them and, therefore, they never could have been the motive for the
   Lord's love, nor the reason why it flowed towards us! O you unworthy
   ones, you saints that feel your deep natural depravity and mourn over
   your ruin by the fall of Adam, lift up your hearts to God! He has
   delivered you from all the impediments which Adam cast upon you! Your
   tongue is now loosed--Adam made it dumb, but God has loosed it! Your
   eyes, which were blinded by Adam's fall, are now opened by Him who has
   lifted you up from the horrible pit and the miry clay! What Adam lost
   for us, Christ has regained for us. He has set our feet upon a rock and
   established our goings--and He has put a new song into our mouth, even
   praise unto our God!

   Before I leave this point, I must remind you how this ought to give you
   encouragement in seeking to do good to others. Why, my Brothers and
   Sisters, I can never think any man too far gone for God's mercy since I
   know that He saved me! Whenever I have felt despondent about any of my
   hearers who have, for a long time, persevered in guilt, I have only had
   to reach down my own biography from the shelves of my memory and think
   what I was till Divine Grace rescued me and brought me to my Savior's
   feet. And then I have said, "It will be no wonder if that man is
   saved--after what the Lord has done for me, I can believe anything of
   my Master! If He has blotted out my transgressions. If He has put away
   mysins, then I can never despair of any ofmy fellow creatures. They may
   be dumb, now, but He can make them sing."

   Your son John is a sad reprobate--keep on praying for him, mother--God
   can change his very nature. Your daughter's heart seems hard as
   adamant, but He who makes the dumb sing can cause even that rock to
   melt! Believe in God for your children, as well as for yourselves! Take
   their cases before His Throne of Grace! Rely upon Him to save them and
   believe that in answer to earnest prayer, He will do so. And if you
   have neighbors who are full of the pestilence of sin, whose vices come
   up before you as a stench in your nostrils, yet fear not to carry the
   Gospel to them! Though they are harlots, drunks, swearers, be not
   afraid to tell them of the Savior's dying love. He makes the dumb
   sing--He does not ask for even a voice to begin with--they are dumb and
   He does not ask of them even the power of speech, but He gives them the
   power! If you have neighbors who keep not the Sabbath, love not God and
   are not willing to come to His House--and even despise Christ--if you
   find them as far gone as they can be, remember, He makes the dumb to
   sing and, therefore, He can make them live!

   He needs no goodness in them to begin with--all He needs is the rough,
   raw material, uncut, unpolished--and He does not even need good
   material! Bad as the material may be, He can make it into something
   inestimably precious, something that is worthy of His precious blood!
   Go on with your work for Christ, dear Friends, and fear not concerning
   the worst of men and women--if the dumb can be made to sing, then
   surely you can never say that any man need be cast away because Christ
   cannot save them!

   II. I am now to enter into A FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THESE DUMB PEOPLE.
   Who are they? Sometimes I get a good thought out of Cruden's
   Concordance. I believe that is the best commentary to the Bible and I
   like to study it. I opened it lately at the word, "dumb," and I found
   Master Cruden describing five different kinds of dumb people, but I
   shall name only four of them. The first dumb people he mentions are
   those who cannotspeak. Then, secondly, those who willnotspeak. Thirdly,
   those who darenotspeak and, fourthly, those who have nothingto say and,
   therefore, are dumb.

   Among the dumb people who shall sing are, first, those who cannot
   speak. That is the usual meaning of the word, dumb.The others are, of
   course, only figurative applications of the term. We call a man dumb
   when he cannot speak. Now, spiritually, the man who is still in
   trespasses and sins is dumb, for he is dead and there is none so dumb
   as a dead man! We used to hear, in our childhood, that they buried none
   but deaf and dumb persons in certain churchyards! That saying was
   intended to tickle our childish fancies and it misled us a little, but
   the meaning was that none but dead people were buried there. The Word
   of God assures us that unregenerate men are spiritually dead. It
   follows, then, that they must be spiritually dumb. They cannot sing
   God's praises. They know Him not and, therefore, they cannot exalt His
   glorious name. They cannot, in their natural state, confess their sins.
   They may utter the words of confession, but they cannot really confess,
   for they do not know the evil of sin, nor have they been taught to feel
   what a bitter thing it is. "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
   by the Holy Spirit," and these people cannot truly do so. It may be
   they can talk well of the Doctrines of Grace, but they cannot speak of
   them out of the fullness of their hearts, as living and vital
   principles which they possess in themselves. They cannot join in the
   songs, nor can they take part in the conversation of Christians. If
   they sit for a while with the saints, perhaps they let it be known that
   they have culled a few phrases which they use and apply to certain
   things about which they know nothing. They talk a language the meaning
   of which they do not comprehend--like Milton's daughters reading to
   their father strange tongues which they did not understand. So far as
   the essence of the matter is concerned, these spiritually dead people
   are dumb. But, hail to Sovereign Grace! "The tongue of the dumb shall
   sing!" God will have His darlings made what they should be. They are
   dumb by nature, but He will not leave them so. They cannot now sing His
   praises, but they shall do it! They do not now confess their sins, but
   He will yet bring them to their knees and make them pour out their
   hearts before Him! They cannot now talk the tongue of Canaan, or speak
   the language of Zion, but they shall do it soon! Grace, Omnipotent
   Grace, will have its way with them! They shall be taught to pray! Their
   eyes shall be made to flow with tears of penitence and then, after
   that, their lips shall sing to the praise of Sovereign Grace!

   I need not dwell upon this point because there are many here who once
   were dumb, who can bless God that they now can sing. Does it not
   sometimes seem to you, Beloved, a very strange thing that you are what
   you are? I should think it must be one of the strangest things in the
   world for a dumb man to speak--because he has no idea how a man feels
   when he is speaking, he has no notion of the thing at all! A man, blind
   from his birth, has no idea what kind of a thing sight can be. I have
   heard of a blind man who supposed that the color scarlet must be very
   much like the sound of a trumpet. He knew no other way of describing
   it. So, the dumb man has no notion of the way to talk. Do you not think
   it is a strange thing that you are what you are? You said once, "I will
   never be one of those canting Methodists. Do you think I shall ever
   make a profession of religion? What? I attend a Prayer Meeting? It is
   not likely!" And you went along the streets in all your gaiety of mirth
   and said, "What? I become a little child and give up my mind to simple
   faith, and not reason at all? What? Am I to abandon all argument about
   things and simply take them for granted because God has said them? No,
   that never can be!" Yet that is what hashappened and I will be bound to
   say it will be a wonder to you, as long as you are here, that you are a
   child of God! And even in Heaven, itself, your greatest wonder will be
   that you were ever brought to know the Savior!

   But there are, next, some dumb people who will not speak. They are
   mentioned by Isaiah. He said some of the watchmen in his day were "dumb
   dogs." I bless God that we have not so many of these dumb people as we
   used to have. God has raised up, of late, especially in the Church of
   England, a large number of thoroughly Evangelical men who are not
   afraid to declare the whole counsel of God. There are many such
   faithful preachers of the Gospel to be found. [Stated in 1882.] There
   is no reason why the Church of England should not be thoroughly
   Evangelical. If it keeps to its Articles, it ought to be! It is the
   most inconsistent church in all the world if it is not Calvinistic--and
   it will be inconsistent unless it keeps to those grand fundamental
   Truths of God which are written in its Articles and which are a code of
   faith to be received by all Believers!

   But, oh, there are a great many preachers among Dissenters and in the
   Church of England, too, that are "dumb dogs." There are still plenty
   who hardly know anything about the Gospel! They preach about a great
   many things, but little or nothing about Jesus Christ! They buy their
   sermons cheaply and preach them at their ease. They ask God to teach
   them what to say and then pull their manuscripts out of their pockets!
   We have had to mourn, especially in years gone by, that we could look
   from parish to parish and find only "dumb dogs" in the pulpits. And
   some men who might have spoken with a little earnestness, if they had
   liked, let the people slumber under them instead of preaching the Word
   with true fidelity, remembering that they will have to give account to
   God at the last! My aged grandfather tells a story which I believe he
   could verify, of a person who once resided near him and called himself
   a preacher of the Gospel. He was visited by a poor woman who asked him
   what was the meaning of the new birth, and he replied, "My good woman,
   why do you come to me about that matter? Nicodemus, a ruler of the
   Jews, was a wise man, yet he did not understand about the new
   birth--how do you think I should?" And she had to go away with only
   that answer.

   The time was when such an answer as that might have been given by a
   great many who were reckoned to be the authorized teachers of religion,
   but who really knew nothing about the matter. They understood a great
   deal more about fox-hunting than about preaching--and more about
   farming their land than about the spiritual husbandry of God's Church!
   But we bless God that there are not so many of that sort, now, and we
   pray that the race may become quite extinct--and that every pulpit may
   be filled with a man who has a tongue of fire and a heart of flame and
   who shuns not to declare the whole counsel of God, neither seeking the
   smiles of men nor dreading their frowns!

   We have, in our text, a promise that it shall be so. "The tongue of the
   dumb shall sing." And ah, when God makes them sing, they sing well! You
   remember Rowland Hill's story, in "The Village Dialogues" about Mr.
   Merriman? He was a sad scapegrace of a parson and was to be seen at
   every fair and revel, and was seldom to be found in his pulpit when he
   should have been. But when, by God's Grace, he was converted, he began
   to preach with tears running down his face! The Church soon became
   crowded, but the squire would not go--he even locked up his pew. So Mr.
   Merriman had a little ladder made outside the door, as he did not wish
   to break it open, and the people used to sit on the steps, up one side
   and down the other, so that there was twice as much room as there was
   before!

   No people make such good preachers as those who were once dumb! If the
   Lord opens their mouths, they will think they cannot preach often
   enough, or earnestly enough to make up for the mischief they did
   before! Chalmers himself might never have been so eloquent a preacher
   had he not been, for a long time, a dumb dog! He preached morality, he
   said, till he made all the people in his parish immoral! He kept on
   urging them to keep God's Law till he made them break it! But when he
   turned round and began to preach Christ's Gospel, then the dumb began
   to sing! Oh, may God work this change in every one of us! If we are
   dumb as professed ministers, may He open our mouths and force us to
   speak forth His Word, lest, at the Last Day, the blood of our hearers'
   souls should be found upon our garments and we should be cast away as
   unfaithful stewards!

   I now introduce you to a third sort of dumb people. They are dumb
   because they dare not speak They are good people, blessed souls. Listen
   to one of them--"I was dumb, I opened not my mouth because You did it."
   Ah, it is blessed to be dumb in that fashion! The Lord's servant will
   often have to be dumb under trials and troubles. When Satan tempts him
   to repine, he will put his finger to his lips and say, "Hush, murmuring
   heart! Be still!" "Why does a living man complain, a man for the
   punishment of his sins?" Even the child of God will sometimes do as Job
   did when he sat down upon the ground for seven days and seven nights
   and said not a word, for he felt that his trouble was so heavy that he
   could say nothing. It would have been as well if he had kept his mouth
   shut for the next few days--silence would not have been so bad as some
   things that he uttered! There are times when you and I, Beloved, are
   obliged to keep the bridle on our tongues lest we should murmur against
   God. We are in evil company. Perhaps our spirit is hot within us and we
   want to take vengeance for the Lord. We are like the friends of David
   who would have slain Shimei. "Let us cut off this dead dog's head," we
   say, and then Jesus tells us to put our sword into its scabbard, for,
   "the servant of the Lord must not strive." How often have we thus been
   dumb!

   Sometimes, when there have been slanders against our character and men
   have maligned us, oh, how our fingers have itched to be at them! But we
   have said, "No. Our Master did not answer His accusers and He has left
   us an example that we should follow His steps." The chief priests
   accused Him of many things, but, "He answered them not a word." We have
   found it difficult to be dumb, like the sheep when it is brought to the
   shearer, or the lamb when it is in the slaughterhouse. We could
   scarcely keep quiet. When we have been upon our beds in sickness we
   have tried to quench every murmuring word. We have not let a sentence
   escape our lips when we could possibly avoid it, but, notwithstanding
   all that, we have found it hard work to keep dumb--though it is blessed
   work when we are enabled to do it.

   Now, you who have been dumb under great sorrow. You whose songs have
   been suspended because you dare not open your lips lest sighs should
   usurp the place of praise, come, listen to this promise--"The tongue of
   the dumb shall sing." Yes, though you are now in the deepest trouble
   and are obliged to be silent, you shall yet sing! Though, like Jonah,
   you are in the belly of Hell, as he called it--though the earth with
   her bars seems to be about you forever, and the weeds are wrapped about
   your head--yet you shall look again towards His holy Temple! Though you
   have hung your harp upon the willows, bless God that you have not
   broken it. You will have farther use for it, by-and-by, and you shall
   take it down from its resting place and--

   "Loud to the praise of Love Divine,

   Bid every string awake!"

   If you have no songs in the night, yet the Lord shall compass you about
   with songs of deliverance! If you cannot sing His praises now, you
   shall do so, by-and-by, when greater Grace shall have been poured into
   your heart, or when delivering mercy shall be the subject of your song
   in better days that are yet to come! But, blessed be God, we are not
   always to be silent in affliction. We are bound to sing. Though we are
   dumb as to murmuring, we ought to sing God's praises! An old Puritan
   said, "God's people are like certain birds--they sing best in cages."
   He meant, "God's people often sing the best when they are in the
   deepest trouble." Said old Master Brooks, "The deeper the flood was,
   the higher the ark went up toward Heaven." So is it with the child of
   God--the deeper his troubles, the nearer to Heaven he rises if he lives
   close to his Master. Troubles are called weights and weights, you know,
   generally clog us and keep us down to the earth. But there are ways, by
   the use of the laws of mechanics, by which you can make a weight lift
   you--and so it is possible to make your troubles lift you nearer Heaven
   instead of letting them sink you! God has sometimes opened our mouth
   when we were dumb--when we were ungrateful and did not praise Him. He
   has opened our mouth by a trial and though, when we had a thousand
   mercies, we did not praise Him, yet when He sent a sharp affliction,
   then we began to do so! He has thus made the tongue of the dumb to
   sing.

   I will mention one more kind of dumb people and then I shall have done
   with this part of my subject. There are those who have nothing to
   sayand, therefore, they are dumb. I will give you an instance. Solomon
   says, in the Proverbs, "Open your mouth for the dumb" and he shows, by
   the context, that he means those who, in the court of judgment, have
   nothing to plead for themselves and must stand dumb before the bar.
   Like that man of old who, when the king came in to see the guests, had
   not on a wedding garment--and when the king said, "Friend, how came you
   in here not having a wedding garment?" He stood speechless, not because
   he could not speak, but because he had nothing to say! Have not you and
   I been dumb? Are we not now dumb when we stand on lawterms with God,
   when we forget that Jesus Christ and His blood and righteousness were
   our full acquittal?

   Are we not obliged to be dumb when the Commandments are laid bare
   before us and when the Law of God is brought home to our conscience?
   There was a time with each of us, and not long ago with some here
   present, when we stood before Moses' seat and heard the Commandments
   read. And when we were asked, "Sinner, can you claim to have kept those
   Commandments?" we were dumb. Then we were asked, "Sinner, can you give
   any atonement for the breach of those Commandments?" And we were dumb.
   We were asked, "Sinner, can you, by a future obedience, wipe out your
   past sins?" We knew it was impossible and we were dumb. Then we were
   asked, "Can you endure the penalty? Can you bear to suffer forever in
   the flames of Hell? Can you endure torments that shall never cease? Can
   you dwell with everlasting burnings and abide with eternal fires?" And
   we were dumb.

   Then we were asked the question, "Prisoner at the bar, have you any
   reason to plead why you should not be condemned?" And we were dumb. And
   we were asked, "Prisoner, have you any helper? Have you anyone who can
   deliver you?" And we stood dumb, for we had nothing to say. Yes, but
   blessed be God, the tongue of the dumb can now sing! And shall I tell
   you what we can sing? Why, we can sing this, "Who shall lay anything to
   the charge of God's elect?" Not God, for He has justified us! "Who is
   he that condemns?" Not Christ, for "it is Christ that died, yes,
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also makes intercession for us." We who had not a word to say for
   ourselves, can now say everything! We can say to our Lord--

   "Bold shall I stand in that great day, For who anything to my charge
   shall lay? While through Your blood absolved I am From sin's tremendous
   curse and shame?"

   Yes, the dumb ones can sing! So shall you, poor dumb one, if God has
   made you dumb by taking away all the names of Baal out of your
   mouth--if He has taken away all your self-righteousness and all your
   trust in yourself--as truly as ever He has shut your mouth, He will
   open it! If God has killed your self-righteousness, He will give you a
   better one! If He has knocked down all your refuges of lies, He will
   build you up a good refuge! He has not come to destroy you. He has shut
   your mouth that He may fill it with His praise. Be of good cheer! Cast
   your eyes to the Cross! Look to Jesus! Put your confidence in Him and
   even you, who think yourself a castaway--even you, poor weeping
   Mary--even you shall yet sing of redeeming Grace and dying love!

   III. Now I have to conclude by noticing THE OCCASIONS WHEN THE TONGUE
   OF THESE DUMB PEOPLE SINGS THE BEST.

   When does the tongue of the dumb sing? Why, I think it sings always,
   little or much! If it is once set at liberty, it will never leave off
   singing. There are some of you people who say that this world is a
   howling wilderness. Well, if so, you are the howlers, you make all the
   howling! If you choose to howl, I cannot help it, but I prefer the
   promise of my text, "Then shall the tongue of the dumb," not howl, but,
   "sing!" Yes, they sing always, little or much! Sometimes it is in a low
   note. Sometimes they have to go rather deep in the bass, but there are
   other times when they can mount to the highest notes of all. They have
   special times of singing. When they lost their burden at the foot of
   the Cross--that is the time when they begin to sing! Never did a harp
   of Heaven sound so sweetly as when touched by the finger of some
   returning prodigal! Not even the songs of the angels seem to me to be
   so sweet as that first song of rapture which rushes forth from the
   inmost soul of the forgiven child of God! You know how John Bunyan
   describes it. He says when poor Christian lost his burden at the Cross,
   he gave three great leaps and went on his way singing! We have not
   forgotten those three great leaps--they were great leaps of praise! We
   have leaped many times since then with joy and gratitude, but we think
   we never leaped so high as we did at the time when we saw our many sins
   all gone and our transgressions covered up in the tomb of the Savior!
   So you see, dear Friends, that is one time when we can sing--when we
   lose our burden at the Cross.

   And after that, do God's people sing? Yes, they have sweet singing
   times in their hours of communion. Oh, the music of that word,
   "communion," when it is heard in the soul--communion with Jesus,
   fellowship with Jesus--whether in His sufferings or in His glories!
   These are singing times, when the heart is lifted up to feel its
   oneness with Christ, and its vital union with Him, and is enabled to
   "rejoice in hope of the glory of God," through communion with the
   Savior!

   Have you not had some precious singing times at the Lord's Table? Ah,
   when the bread has been broken, and the wine poured out, how often has
   it been to me a time of song when the people have all joined in
   singing--

   "Gethsemane, can I forget? Or there Your conflict see Your agony and
   bloody sweat, And not remember Thee? When to the Cross I turn my eyes,
   And rest on Calvary,

   Lamb of God! My Sacrifice!

   1 must remember Thee."

   I am in the House of God, I think--every day. I believe that David
   could not have asked for more than I have received when he prayed that
   he might dwell in the House of the Lord forever, for I spend more of my
   time in the House of God than I do anywhere else. But my best moments
   are at the Lord's Table. I rejoice then, when I have no thought of what
   I have to say to others, but simply sit down among the Lord's family
   and taste my morsel of bread, and have my sip of the wine. Oh, it is
   then that the soul finds its Savior precious! I look forward for every
   month to come when I may once more sit at the table of my Master and
   spiritually eat His flesh and drink His blood, and feel that I have,
   indeed, life in Him because I am in true union with Him. Ah, these are
   singing times to the family of God! And so, sometimes, are preaching
   times and hearing times. Prayer Meetings are often special singing
   times--in fact, all the means of Grace will very frequently be blessed
   of God to be to us the occasions of song!

   But, lastly, my dear Friends, for I cannot stop to mention all these
   singing times, the best we shall have will be when we come to die! Ah,
   there are some of you who will be like what is fabled of the swan. The
   ancients said that the swan never sang in his lifetime, but always sang
   as he was about to die. Now, there are many of God's desponding
   children who seem to go live their life under a cloud, but they get a
   swan's song before they die. The river of their life comes running
   down, perhaps, black and miry with troubles--and when it begins to
   touch the white foam of the sea, there comes a little glistening in its
   waters. So, Beloved, though we may have been very much dispirited by
   reason of the burden of the way, when we get to the end we shall have
   sweet songs! Are you afraid of dying? Oh, never be afraid of that! Be
   afraid of living! Living is the only thing which can do us
   mischief--dying never can hurt a Christian! Afraid of the grave? It is
   like the bath of Esther in which she lay for a time, to purify herself
   with spices. The grave fits the body for Heaven. There it lies and
   corruption, earth, and worms do but refine and purify our flesh!

   Be not afraid of dying--it does not take any time at all. Death is
   emancipation, deliverance, Heaven's bliss to a child of God! Never fear
   it--it will be a singing time. You are afraid of dying, you say,
   because of the pains of death. No, they are the pains of life--of life
   struggling to continue. Death has no pain--death, itself, is but one
   gentle sigh--the fetter is broken and the spirit released. The best
   moment of a Christian's life is his last one because it is the one that
   is nearest Heaven--and then it is that he begins to strike the keynote
   of the song which he shall sing to all eternity! Oh, what a song will
   that be! It is a poor noise we make, now, when we join the song here.
   Perhaps we are almost ashamed to sing! But up there our voices shall be
   clear and good! And there--

   "Loudest of the crowd we'll sing,

   While Heaven's resounding mansions ring

   With shouts of Sovereign Grace!" The thought struck me, the other day,
   that the Lord will have in Heaven some of those very big sinners--ones
   who have gone further astray than anybody else that ever lived--just to
   make the melody complete by singing some of those alto notes we
   sometimes hear which you and I, because we have not gone so far astray,
   will never be able to utter! I wonder whether one has stepped into this
   Chapel, this morning, whom God has selected to take some of those alto
   notes in the scale of praise? Perhaps there is one such here. Oh, how
   loudly will he sing, if Grace, Free Grace, shall have mercy upon him!

   And now, farewell, with just this parting word. My Brothers and
   Sisters, members of this Church, strive together in your prayers, that
   God may bless you. Be not content with what you are, however prosperous
   you may be, but seek to increase more and more. Pray that you and your
   children may be added to the Church of Christ, here, and may live to
   see others added, too. Do not neglect your Prayer Meetings. Christmas
   Evans gives us a good idea about prayer. He says, "Prayer is the rope
   in the belfry. We pull it and it rings the bell up in Heaven." And so
   it is. Mind you keep that bell going! Pull it often at home and come up
   to the Prayer Meetings and keep on pulling it! And though the bell is
   up so high that you cannot hear it ring, depend upon it, it can be
   heard in the tower of Heaven and it is ringing before the Throne of
   God, who will give you answers of peace according to your faith. May
   your faith be large and plentiful, and so will be the answers! Amen.

"Peace in Believing"

   (No. 2626)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 11, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 19, 1882.

   "Peace in believing." Romans 15:13.

   ON whatever subjects I may be called to preach, I feel it to be a duty
   which I dare not neglect to be continually going back to the Doctrine
   of the Cross--the fundamental Truth of God of justification by faith
   which is in Christ Jesus. This topic is essential to the life of the
   soul. Men are not saved but by faith in Jesus and, therefore, to this
   great central point we must return again and again and again, hoping
   that God will bless His own Word to those who hear it proclaimed. I
   notice that some of our friends, who are bakers, have in their shop
   windows divers articles of confectionery, and I suppose they have their
   set days for making their various kinds of cake and sweetmeats. But one
   thing I know they never forget to do and that is to bake, every day, a
   batch of bread because, if their customers do not need this or that
   confectionery, they always need bread--and what is the good of a baker
   if he has no bread? I wish that every preacher felt that, albeit there
   are certain things which are sweet and toothsome, which some mouths are
   always craving, yet the chief business of the minister, like that of
   the baker, is to have a constant supply of good bread. It may be a very
   ordinary kind of food.

   Some may even call it commonplace and what a mercy it is when bread is
   a commonplace thing! I have known some people who would have been glad
   if they could place it in common upon their tables, but they have not
   been able to get it, and the necessity has grown into a luxury. And
   what a mercy it is when the Gospel is a commonplace thing--when you
   have so much of it that you really understand it, enjoy it and feed
   upon it! It is then as it ought always to be with the true ministry of
   the Gospel. So, preacher, whatever you choose to neglect, never neglect
   to preach Christ Crucified and the simple, soul-saving precept, "Look
   and live."

   What if there are some prophetic passages which you cannot understand?
   The day shall declare them! What if there are certain deep Doctrines
   that are too profound for you? You and your people shall learn them in
   eternity, if you learn them not in time! But as for this Doctrine,
   that, "he that believes on the Son has everlasting life"--it must be
   learned now or never! And if it is not learned now, men will be shut
   out of Heaven eternally. Therefore, let this Truth of God be proclaimed
   again and again and again! Let it still be preached, even though some
   who have itching ears weary of it, for there is an urgent necessity
   that it should be made known whether men will hear or whether they will
   forbear. Better that the sun should not rise than that Christ should
   not be preached! Better that the wheels of time should stand still than
   that the name of Jesus should not be sounded forth! Better that the
   dews be withheld and the rain fall not again upon the earth, than that
   the glorious Gospel of the blessed God be hidden from the sons of men!

   So, then, this is my reason for coming to you, again, as I have come so
   many hundreds of times before, with the same old message, "Believe and
   live." I am comforted by the persuasion that all who are saved by
   believing are the most ready to hear this story over and over again. It
   is not what I do not know so much as what I do know that I delight to
   hear-- and many others are of the same opinion as I am in that matter.
   It is a curious phase of human nature, but it is true. You may talk to
   a congregation about discoveries in the center of Africa and yet you
   may lose their attention. But if you speak about the village, or
   hamlet, or street in which one of them was born or lived, he will prick
   up his ears at once. The very thing that he knows best is that which,
   somehow, holds his attention the most. So have I often seen it in the
   highest affairs--they who understand the Gospel best are the most ready
   to hear of it again and yet again. If I were to take Luther on the
   Galatians, intending to give it as a present to someone who would be
   sure to appreciate it, I would not bestow it upon a man who was not a
   believer in Jesus Christ, or give it to one who did not understand the
   Doctrine of salvation by faith--I would hand it over to the man who has
   long believed in Christ and found rest in Him--for I would be certain
   that the strong and racy utterances of the great Reformer would be
   appreciated by him. They love the Gospel most who know it best!

   Another thing comforts me, too, namely, that in such a congregation as
   this there are always some persons who are just ready to believe. I
   throw the fly with confidence because there are always fish rising to
   it. God is plowing the hearts of many and so preparing the soul for the
   good Seed of the Kingdom! Little children die. Aged mothers are carried
   away. There is sickness in the body, or loss in the business, or
   suffering of various kinds--all this is the passing of God's great plow
   up and down these furrows--and when I scatter the good Seed, I know
   that the furrows are gaping for it. They are hungry for it, so they
   gladly receive it! Here are many of those who are ordained unto eternal
   life to whom the Truth of God concerning "peace in believing" comes as
   the very message of God to their soul, the good news that they are most
   glad to hear! So they receive it and go on their way rejoicing.
   Doubtless, there are some hearers of that kind here right now--oh, that
   we may very soon hear of their conversion, for it would gladden our
   heart to have such good tidings! Therefore, by the help of God, let us
   at once get to our work.

   I. And, first, having to talk about faith and one of its sweet
   results--for our subject is that faith brings peace to the soul, "peace
   in believing"--the first head shall be that IT IS A FILLING PEACE.

   In the verse from which our text is taken, the Apostle says, "Now the
   God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing," so that the
   peace which arises from faith is a filling peace. There is, in the
   heart of an awakened man, a great vacuum caused by sin. He is like some
   of those great artificial harbors which I have seen, in various places,
   out of which they sometimes allow all the water to run and there
   remains a dreary expanse of mud. What is the use of it? What is needed
   in order to make it of service once more? Why, simply that the tide
   should come into it, fill it and cover up all that mud! As I look on
   some of you, dear Friends, I know that your heart is just like that
   great harbor full of mire. What is to be done for you? What is to be
   done withyou? Well, the Grace of God can come in and cover all your
   transgressions and your iniquities till they shall never be mentioned
   against you ever again! What a blessed peace that is which quiets the
   conscience--which takes away the sense of guilt and puts in the place
   of it, consciousness of perfect pardon, of justification and of
   acceptance before God! This is "peace in believing." It fills the
   vacuum that sin has made.

   Then this Divine flood, when it has covered that part of our distress,
   flows in over our sinfulness as well as our sins, for, in addition to
   our actual transgression, there is the defilement of our nature. And
   when a man is awakened, it is a cause of moaning and unrest to him that
   he not only has sin, but that he issin--that his very nature is a
   fountain of evil containing much that is adverse to God and in
   alienation from Him. But, by believing, there flows into the heart a
   flood of life which removes our death--a purifying stream which takes
   away our corruption and we have peace with God, for "we which have
   believed do enter into rest" about that matter, too. And though we
   sometimes have to cry, "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death?" Yet we "thank God, through Jesus Christ
   our Lord," that we are delivered from the dominion of sin and that we
   shall, by-and-by, be delivered from the very existence of it and shall
   be like unto God in purity and true holiness. That is, indeed, a
   blessed peace--a peace that comes of a changed nature, of a renewed
   heart and of reconciliation to God.

   You will tell me that those blessings are enough to fill a man with
   peace and, truly, I think they are. But as when the tide comes in, it
   not only rolls up the main stream of the Thames, but it also flows into
   every creek and fills every tiny streamlet, so is it with the Grace of
   God. There is a black stream that sometimes runs into the river of a
   man's life and makes it turbid--that is the fear of death. But, oh, I
   have seen the great flood of eternal life come rolling up and drive the
   black stream back till all was pure, all was quiet and calm! Is it not
   so with the man who believes in Jesus? He loses the fear of death.
   Sometimes, instead of fearing it, he almost longs for it! As Mr.
   Flavel, when living in sweetest communion with Christ, said, "I never
   saw a face more beautiful than that of death when I saw the light from
   the face of Christ fall on it. Then I longed to die much more than to
   live." And good Dr. Watts sang--

   "Oh, if my Lord would come and meet, My soul should stretch her wings
   in haste, Fly fearless through Death's iron gate, Nor feel the terrors
   as she passed!"

   Yes, this "peace in believing" will fill your soul so as to drown the
   fear of death!

   Perhaps another says, " The fear of life is that which is upon me, the
   fear of the troubles incident to my condition and my position among my
   fellow men, the fear which arises out of those three questions, 'What
   shall we eat? What shall we drink? And how shall we be clothed?'"
   Beloved, the peace which comes through believing will chase these fears
   away and fill your soul with perfect rest concerning them. Indeed,
   these things will seem to you to be only trifles after which the
   Gentiles seek--and you will scorn to be troubled by them, for you will
   remember that "your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of all
   these things," and He will supply your need in His own good time and
   way.

   Then, sometimes, will come upon us, to break our peace, the cravings of
   desire. A man is never perfectly at peace if he is ambitious and
   craving for this or that which, as yet, is beyond his reach. "Peace in
   believing" makes us say of Christ, "He is all my salvation and all my
   desire." He loves us to know that all things are ours and, therefore,
   that there is nothing left in the region of desire, for--

   "All things are ours--the gift of God-- The purchase of a Savior's
   blood! While the good Spirit shows us how To use and to improve them
   too." Oh, what a blessed, blessed rest it is when a man's desires are
   satisfied with the favor of God!

   One very natural cause of disturbance of mind is solicitude about our
   families--anxiety as to how we shall bring them up in the fear of God,
   earnest longing that they may become believers in Christ, honorable
   Christian men and women, but Faith learns to bear even this without
   having her peace broken, for she pleads the promise, "Unto you, and to
   your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord
   our God shall call." Faith falls back upon the Inspired Word--"But the
   mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that
   fear Him, and His righteousness unto the children's children, to such
   as keep His covenant, and to those that remember His commandments to do
   them." I know of no cause of disquietude which faith will not remove. I
   know of no groundswell disturbing the mind which faith cannot quiet. I
   know of nothing on earth, in Heaven, in Hell, in time, in eternity, in
   life, in death which is not fully met by the Covenant blessings which
   are within reach of faith and which faith learns to appropriate. This
   "peace in believing" is a sea that has no bottom nor shore--it is a
   peace of intense restfulness! Oh, that we were all plunged in it this
   very hour!

   II. Now, very briefly, let me remind you that, according to the text,
   IT IS FAITH'S PEACE that is such a filling peace as I have tried to
   describe.

   I may be addressing some persons who are needing to find peace for
   their souls, but they have never sought faith's peace. There is a false
   peace that some get--the peace of carelessness--they do not even think
   about eternity. They "count it one of the wisest things to drive dull
   care away." They scarcely think of what will happen even a month ahead,
   but they say that they are content to live by the day. This is the way
   in which the man protects himself when, after the thief has broken into
   his house, he covers up his head, lies in bed and thinks that he and
   his property must be safe because he cannot hear the burglar at work.
   This is the kind of philosophy of men who, when they are ready to fail
   in business, shut up their books and never take stock because they
   would be so disturbed if they knew their real condition! It is a
   beggarly, cowardly kind of peace that is fit for fools and madmen, but
   is not fit for you who are reasonable, responsible beings. Oh, I would
   scorn to have a peace in my heart which consisted in shutting my eyes!
   The truth ought to be faced and, the more dangerous the truth, the more
   urgently does it call upon us to look at it! And he is the wise man who
   can stand before the truth that frightens most men and, having looked
   it in the face, can say, "Now I am not afraid. I am, rather, the more
   established in my conviction of my safety, now that I have seen that
   which would have destroyed me if it had not been for faith in Christ."
   Shun, I pray you, the safety which is but in appearance, and does but
   thinly film the deadly ulcer that needs to be eradicated from your
   body!

   Some others seek a peace which comes of hardihood. They not merely shut
   their eyes, but they lie against the Truth of God. "The fool has said
   in his heart, There is no God," and he gets peace out of that foolish
   and false declaration. Men deny the immortality of the soul. They deny
   the Divinity of Christ. They deny the Inspiration of the Bible and so
   they think that they shall sew pillows together that shall make it easy
   for their heads to rest! Let those do this who dare, but, as for some
   of you, you cannot do it, for you know too much and you have felt too
   much to ever be self-deceived in such a fashion as that! Can he ever be
   an infidel who has seen his mother die joyfully triumphant? Is it
   possible for me, for instance, to find a shelter from my sins by
   denying that there is any hereafter, when I have stood by the bedside
   of saints and seen their ecstasy, and have heard the strange things,
   scarcely lawful for a man to utter, which they have told concerning
   that which is within the veil? Some of us are spoiled for infidelity,
   for we have had familiar communion with the Eternal! We have spoken
   with Him, "as a man speaks with his friend" and, therefore, this escape
   from thought avails us not! Thank God that it does not avail us, for
   the abhorred of the Lord fall into this deep ditch and how seldom do
   they come up out of it! May God grant that we may never need to tell a
   lie and violate our conscience in order to give it peace! That is not
   the rest of faith which I commend to you!

   Some have tried to get peace from self-confidence. They think they are
   as good as others, if not rather better. As they see those who are mere
   professors of religion, they thank God that they are not professors of
   religion, for they are not hypocritical and, therefore, they do not
   pretend to be what they are not. Yet there is often a worm at the root
   of that proud boasting and, in your sober moments, you who talk in this
   fashion do not really think thus of yourselves. You are not insane and
   you know that you are not doing that which is pleasing to God, or
   living to His Glory. Self-righteousness is sometimes a delusion, but it
   generally begins by a man's attempting to delude himself. But there is
   no real peace to be obtained by any works that we can perform, or by
   the pretense that we have performed works which are meritorious in the
   sight of God. There is no promise of peace to come in this fashion.

   But, perhaps, you have patched up your self-righteousness with a few
   ornaments stolen from the Church of God. Were you, as an infant,
   "baptized" and made "a member of Christ, a child of God, and an
   inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven"? Have you been confirmed, and taken
   the "sacrament"--as it is wrongly called--and is there not much
   efficacy in that? Sirs, listen to me! There is nothingin it! There is
   nothing whatever in it unless you have first believed in the Lord Jesus
   Christ! Or, if there is anything in it, you have participated in
   ordinances to which you had no right, for these things are only for
   Believers--and if you have not believed in Jesus, you are intruders
   into His Church and you have stolen from His altar that which He
   reserves for His own people--and little advantage will this be to you.
   Beware of trusting in your church-going, or your chapel-going, or your
   Tabernacle-going! Beware of trusting in your prayers, or your Bible
   reading, in your hymns and holy thoughts and almsgivings. They are all
   lighter than vanity and, as chaff from the fan of the winnower, shall
   they be blown away! There is no peace in them though you multiply them
   as the sand upon the seashore. Our text speaks of "peace in believing,"
   and there is no peace worthy of the name that is to be found in any
   other way!

   III. But now, thirdly, this "peace in believing" is A WELL-FOUNDED
   PEACE. But what is it?

   It is, first, a peace which is the result of believing the Word of God,
   who cannot lie. God, the ever-blessed Father, says, "Listen to Me. I
   have given My Well-Beloved Son to be a Savior to you. Trust in Him and
   you shall be saved." I trust in Him and I am saved. How do I know that?
   Why, because God said so! And God cannot lie! Is there any better
   foundation for peace in this world than the Word of God? What God has
   spoken must be true. "Let God be true and every man a liar." And I,
   believing what He has said, have a right to all the peace that can come
   out of that sure Word which I have believed!

   Remember, too, that this Word of God comes to us by the Inspiration of
   the Holy Spirit. If you do not believe that Book to be Inspired, I have
   nothing to say to you just now. But most of us do believe that every
   part of it is "God-breathed." Well, then, knowing that Book to be the
   Infallible Word of God, if we get peace through believing what is in
   that Book, we have sure ground to stand upon! Either the Book is a lie,
   or else our faith is fully warranted, and our peace is perfectly
   justified. Oh, what a blessed thing it is to feel that you have
   Scripture at your back! Many saints that I have read of have asked,
   when dying, to have their fingers laid upon some precious promise of
   the Word, and they have thus witnessed to their conviction that the
   passage was the very Truth of God to their souls. One said, "Guide me
   to that glorious Eighth of Romans." Another had his finger laid upon
   this text, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." And
   another on this verse, "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the
   shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You are with me, Your rod and
   Your staff they comfort me." You know how you take one another's word
   and trust to it. And when you get a note of hand in black and white
   from a good tradesman, you do not mistrust it. Then, shall we ever
   mistrust the black and white of God--the record of His dear Son which
   He has given us in Holy Scripture? No! Nor will we mistrust the peace
   that comes into our heart through believing it!

   And then, my Brothers and Sisters, also mark that our peace is founded
   on God's testimony concerning His Son. He tells us, in this Book, that
   the Only-Begotten took upon Him human form and came down among
   men--that being here,

   He lived the life of a servant and, at the last, taking upon Him man's
   sin and as the Substitute for guilty men, He went up to the Cross and
   there bore His Father's wrath, dying in the place of the guilty, "the
   Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." I recollect how I
   grasped that Truth of God when I first understood it--it was that
   Doctrine of Substitution which brought peace to my troubled spirit. I
   saw that if Christ died for me, then I should not die! And that, if He
   paid my debt, it was paid and I was clear! And I knew that this was the
   case as soon as I believed in Him. So I did believe in Him and I was
   filled with "peace in believing." And that "peace in believing" meets
   every need of the heart. Are you troubled? "All things work together
   for good to them that love God." Are you afraid that you shall fall?
   Rest content about that, also, for, "He will keep the feet of His
   saints." Are you afraid that you shall ultimately perish? Has He not
   said, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and
   I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of My hand"?

   Our faith is, indeed, well-founded, and can be abundantly justified!
   Faith in Christ is nothing but common sense of sanctified of God. It
   may be common sense to trust some banker who has long maintained his
   credit and not to be always worrying about whether he is solvent or
   not, but it is infinitely greater common sense to trust God--to trust
   His Son-- to trust His Spirit--to trust His Word! If you trust these,
   you shall enjoy a calmness of spirit which will not be the effect of a
   mistaken confidence, but the result of the most glorious facts--a peace
   which may be questioned and cross-questioned, examined and
   cross-examined, but the answer it shall give to all enquiries will be
   satisfactory. Faith's building may be searched, tried and tested from
   foundation to top stone, but no flaw shall be found in any part of it.
   It is a good, wise, true, just and proper thing to trust the Lord Jesus
   Christ--and so to have "peace in believing!"

   IV. I have done when I have noticed just one more point, namely, that I
   believe this "peace in believing" to be A MOST FRUITFUL PEACE.

   I wish you all knew it, for, first, it makes even this world a better
   and a happier place. It takes the sting out of all troubles to have
   "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." There is no man who is
   so ready to cope with the troubles of life as the one who knows that
   all is right for eternity. Some of you often get worried in your daily
   calling and when you come home from business, you cannot rest. When you
   go to bed, you cannot sleep, for there is within you a fear of death
   and of a dreaded something after that. But suppose that a man can say,
   "That matter is all settled"--

   'Tis done! The great transaction's done! I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine!-- "I have trusted myself with Christ, and I know that He is able
   to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day"? He goes
   to his business feeling that he has a burden off his shoulders--the
   great burden he had so long carried-- and he is ready for anybody and
   ready for anything! If you set a man to run up a hill and lay heavy
   weights on his back, he must make slow work of it. Take off those
   weights and now watch him! Why, he turns into a gazelle and he leaps
   from crag to crag when the burden is gone! Ah, dear Friends, if you
   were relieved of your burdens, your very office work would grow
   lighter! Your bargaining would be more wisely done! You would be able
   to deal better with your fellow men when you have come to your proper
   position before God and all is made right there.

   This peace with God is fruitful in the growth of all other Graces. Have
   you a garden? If so, have you some fruit trees in it? Do you dig them
   up every year? Do you take them out of the ground two or three times in
   a season, and carry them about the garden and then plant them in a
   fresh spot? If so, I would not give you a penny for all your fruit! But
   when you plant your tree in good soil and it is well-watered and
   fertilized, when the fruit-bearing season comes, there is your fruit.
   It is a blessed thing to get the very roots of your being entwined
   around Christ--now you can grow, now you can bring forth fruit! Now you
   will get patience. Now you will get hope. Now you will get love and
   soon you will get full assurance! You will have the work of
   sanctification going on, you will be more and more consecrated and
   devoted to Christ-- and you will become "strong in the Lord, and in the
   power of His might." God give you "peace in believing," that you may
   grow in every other Grace!

   And this, I know, will help you to serve others. A man who is enjoying
   the blessings of true religion, living init and living onit, wants
   other people to know about it and to share it with him. I think that
   nobody would give a recommendation to a new kind of food which he did
   not like, himself, and which did him no good. He would say, "Well, if
   this is intended to keep me from being ill, I would rather be ill than
   eat it! I certainly shall not recommend it to others." But he that has
   eaten it, loves the flavor of it and finds that nourishment comes from
   it, says to his friend, "You are getting emaciated, and thin, and
   debilitated as I was--you should try what I have tried." He is sure to
   commend it because it has done so much for him. And when we enjoy the
   Gospel, we are sure to recommend it to others. God's happy people are
   God's working people! Those who fear and tremble and never have any joy
   in the Lord are generally a barren generation. But they who delight
   themselves in the Lord are sure to speak of Him to others and to bring
   others to Christ!

   Lastly, I believe that "peace in believing" is one of the best
   instrumentalities for bringing others to Christ. If you are soon to be
   very happy in a time of trial--if you are known to be very patient in
   great pain--and especially if the Lord helps you to be triumphant in
   the solemn article of death, you will be a soul-winner! Those who come
   round your bed will never forget the joyous look on your face--it will
   be a life-long sermon to them. I do not advise you to sit up like
   Addison and make a show of it, and say, "Come see how a Christian can
   die!" No, that is a style of thing I do not admire. But when you can
   honestly, straightforwardly, without any parade, sweetly fall asleep in
   Jesus Christ, triumphantly entering into Glory and let those around you
   hear your shout of victory as you enter in to be "forever with the
   Lord"--if you can do that, the memory of it will abide--and those who
   were unconvinced, before, are most likely to be decided! While those
   who never hesitated will be more than ever confirmed in the faith!

   In conclusion, to gather up all in a word, you who have no peace may
   have it even now. Believe! That is, trust! Trust Jesus with your souls
   and you shall have "peace in believing." And you who have it, though it
   is somewhat broken, may have it to the fullest! Where you obtained your
   first peace, you can get more! Where peace has only trickled in, it can
   come pouring in, it can rush in like a Heavenly deluge and flood your
   entire nature, to the praise and glory of your gracious God! May He
   make it to be so, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 8:14-39.

   Verse 14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
   sons of God. Leading implies following and those who are enabled to
   follow the guidance of the Divine Spirit are most assuredly children of
   God, for the Lord always leads His own children. If, then, you are
   following the lead of God's Spirit, you have one of the evidences of
   sonship!

   15. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
   you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
   The spirit of bondage is the spirit of servants, not of sons--but that
   servitude is ended for us who are made free in Christ Jesus. We are no
   longer afraid of being called the children of God. We are not afraid of
   our own Father--we have a filial fear of Him, but it is so mixed with
   love that there is no torment in it. Whether Jew or Gentile, we cry,
   "Abba, Father."

   16. The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God. Our spirit knows that we are God's children and then
   God's Spirit adds His testimony to the witness of our spirit that we
   are the children of God.

   17. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we map be also glorified
   together. This would not necessarily be true of any man's family, for
   he might have children who were not his heirs. But in God's family, all
   who are born into it are born "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ." We must take our part of Christ's portion--His portion here,
   and His portion hereafter--the rule for us who are in Him shall be,
   "share and share alike." He Himself has said, "Where I am, there shall
   also My servant be." And all that He has, He will divide with us. Are
   you willing, dear Brothers and Sisters, to take shares with Christ? If
   not, then I question whether you can be rightly reckoned among His
   saints.

   18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
   worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. '
   'Light afflictions" are contrasted with "an exceeding weight of glory."
   Temporary afflictions, but for a moment, are to be followed by
   everlasting crowns that fade not away. What a contrast!

   19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the
   manifestation of the sons of God. All creation is, as it were, watching
   and waiting on tiptoe for the day when God shall manifest His sons and
   daughter, who, at present, are hidden. In due time, they shall come
   forth, acknowledged of God, and then shall the whole creation rejoice!

   20-23. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
   by reason of Him who has subjected the same in hope, because the
   creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption
   into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the
   whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now. And not
   only they, but ourselves, also, which have the first fruits of the
   Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
   adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. We have already obtained
   salvation for our souls, but our body is still under bondage--subject
   to weariness--to pain, to infirmity--to death. But, by-and-by, with the
   new creation, our newly-molded bodies shall be fit to live in the new
   world and fit for our newborn souls to inhabit. This is the full
   redemption for which we are waiting!

   24-28. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
   what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for what we
   see not, then do we with patience wait for it Likewise the Spirit also
   helps our infirmities: for we knownot what we shouldpray for as we
   ought: but the Spirit itselfmakes intercession for us with groans which
   cannot be uttered. And He that searches the hearts knows what is the
   mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints
   according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together
   for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to
   His purpose. "We know that all things work together for good to them
   that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose."
   That is a wonderfully positive statement, Paul! There are certain
   persons, nowadays, who say that we knownothing, yet the Apostles
   constantly say, "We know this" and, "We know that." These people tell
   us that there is a great distinction between believing and
   knowing--but, evidently it is a distinction of which the Inspired
   Apostles knew nothing at all! Read the Epistles of John and note how he
   continually says, "We know, we know, we know," and how frequently he
   adds, "We believe," as though believing and knowing were the same
   thing! Agnostics may declare that they know nothing, if they please,
   but, as for us who do know, because we believe what we are taught of
   God in this Book, we will speak! He who has something to say has a
   right to say it! We know and therefore we speak!

   Mark, Brothers and Sisters, how the Apostle speaks here. He does not
   say that all things shall work together for good. No, but that they do
   work together. They are nowworking for your present good. This is not
   merely something which shall eventually turn out right--right now it is
   all right! "We know that all things are working together for good to
   them that love God, to them who are the called according to His
   purpose." No sooner does the Apostle mention that word, "purpose," than
   he must begin a long discourse upon it. He was not afraid or ashamed to
   speak of the purposes of God! There are some preachers who say nothing
   about God's purposes, or God's decrees--they seem to be afraid of
   them--they say it is "Calvinistic doctrine." Why, it was here, in the
   Scriptures, long before Calvin was born! So what right have they to
   call it by hisname? Listen to what the Apostle has to say--

   29, 30. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
   many brethren. Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called:
   and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them
   He also glorified. There is no separating these golden links of love
   and mercy! That foreknowledge, to which all future things are open and
   present, begins the deed of love. Predestination comes in and chooses a
   people for God who shall be eternally His. Upon this, in due time,
   follows effectual calling by which the chosen ones are brought out,
   from the impure mass of mankind, and set apart unto God. Then follows
   justification by faith, through the precious blood and righteousness of
   Jesus Christ! And where this is, glory will certainly come, for "whom
   He justified, them He also glorified."

   31, 32. What shall we say, then, to these things? If God is for us, who
   can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
   for us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely give us all things?
   Notice, it is not simply "freely give us all things," but, "with Him,
   also freely give us all things." You shall get all things with Christ,
   but you shall get nothing without Christ, for all the other gifts come
   in this one! God first gave us His Son and He gives us everything in
   Him.

   33. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who
   justifies. Ring out the challenge in Heaven itself! Trumpet it through
   all the caverns of Hell! Let the whole universe hear it! "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect?" None can, for "it is God who
   justifies," and His justification blocks every charge that is brought
   against His people--

   "Who shall the Lord's elect condemn? 'Tis God that justifies their
   souls And mercy, like a mighty stream, O'er all their sins divinely
   rolls."

   34. Who is he that condemns?None will answer to that challenge, for

   34, 35. It is Christ that died, yes, rather, that is risen again, who
   is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Oh, this blessed
   question--this touching question! It seems to come at the end of all
   the others--a rear-guard which effectually prevents our treasures from
   being taken from us. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

   35. Shall tribulation?That has been tried. Have not the saints been
   beaten like wheat upon the threshing-floor? Has not affliction been to
   them a stern test of the reality of their faith? But Christ has loved
   them none the less for all the suffering that He has permitted to fall
   upon them.

   35. Or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
   sword? When they have been in famine or poverty, has Christ ever
   forsaken His saints? Ah, no--He has loved them all the more! Have any
   of these things separated us from our Savior? No, but they have, to our
   own consciousness, knitted us even more closely to our Divine Lord.
   Cruel men have tried every form of persecuting the saints of God. They
   have been more inventive in the torments which they have applied to
   Christians than in almost anything else! Yet no torture, no rack, no
   imprisonment has ever divided them from Christ. They have clung to Him
   after the manner of John Bunyan, who, when they said that he might go
   free if he would promise not to preach the Gospel, said, "I will lie in
   prison till the moss grows on my eyelids rather than I will ever make
   such a promise as that! If you let me out of prison today, I will
   preach tomorrow, by the Grace of God."

   36. As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we
   are accounted as sheep for the slaughter But there has been no triumph
   over the saints in this case.

   37-39. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him
   that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord--

   "Not all that men on earth can do, Nor powers on high, nor powers
   below, Shall cause His mercy to remove, Or wean our hearts from Christ
   our love." Glory be unto His holy name! Amen.

The Best Friend

   (No. 2627)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 18, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGE0N,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 23, 1882.

   "Your own friend, and your father's friend, forsake not." Proverbs
   27:10.

   TRUE friends are very scarce. We have a great many acquaintances and,
   sometimes, we call them friends and so misuse the noble word,
   "friendship." Perhaps, in some later day of adversity, when these
   so-called friends have looked out for their own interests and left us
   to do the best we can for ourselves, that word, friendship, may come
   back to us with sad and sorrowful associations. The friend in need is a
   friend, indeed, and such friends, I say again, are scarce. When you
   have found such a man and proved the sincerity of his friendship. When
   he has been faithful to your father and to you, grapple him to yourself
   with hooks of steel and never let him go! It may be that because he is
   a faithful friend, he will sometimes vex you and anger you. See how
   Solomon puts it in this very chapter--"Open rebuke is better than
   secret love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend." It takes a great
   deal of friendship to be able to tell a man his faults. It is not
   friendship that flatters! It is small friendship that holds its tongue
   when it ought to speak. But it is true friendship that can speak at the
   right time and, if necessary, even speak so sharply as to cause a
   wound. If you are like many other foolish folk, you will be angry with
   the man who is so much your friend that he will tell you the truth. If
   you are unworthy of your friend, you will begin to grow weary of him
   when he is performing on your behalf the most heroic act of pure
   charity by warning you of your danger and reminding you of your
   imperfection! Solomon, in prospect of such a case, knowing that this is
   one of the greatest trials of friendship among such poor imperfect
   beings as we are, tells us not to forsake, for this reason--nor indeed,
   for any other reason--the man who has been to us and to our family a
   true friend. "Your own friend, and your father's friend, forsake not."

   I do not think that I would waste your time if I were to give you a
   lecture upon friendship--its duties, its dangers, its rights and its
   privileges--but it is not my intention to do so. There is one Friend to
   whom these words of Solomon are especially applicable. There is a
   Friend who is the chief and highest of all friends and when I speak of
   Him, I feel that I am not spiritualizing the text in the least. He is a
   true and real Friend and these words are truly and really applicable to
   Him. And if ever the text is emphatic, it is so when it is applied to
   Him, for there was never such another Friend to us and to our fathers!
   There is no Friend to whom we ought to be so intensely attached as to
   Him. "Your own Friend, and your father's Friend, forsake not."

   I want, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to speak upon this
   subject. First, here is a descriptive title which may be fitly applied
   to Christ by many of us. He is our own Friend, and also our father's
   Friend. Secondly, here is suggestive advice concerning this Friend.
   "Forsake Him not." And before I have done, I shall say a little upon a
   consequent resolution. I hope that we shall turn the text into a solemn
   resolve and say, "My own Friend, and my father's Friend, I will not
   forsake."

   I. First, then, here is A DESCRIPTIVE TITLE for our blessed Lord and
   Master.

   First, he is a Friend, the Friend of man. I know that Young calls him
   the "great Philanthropist." I do not care to see that title--it is not
   good enough for Him--though truly the great Lover of man is Christ.
   Better still is the title which was given to Him when He was upon
   earth, "the Friend of sinners."--

   "Friend of sinners is His name."

   Their Friend--thinking of them with love when no other eye pitied them,
   and no other heart seemed to care for them. Their Friend, entering in
   most tender sympathy into the case of the lost, for "the Son of Man
   came to seek and to save that which was lost." Their Friend--giving
   them good and sound advice and wholesome counsel, for whoever listens
   to the Words of Christ shall find in His teaching and in His guidance
   the highest wisdom. Their Friend, however, giving far more than
   sympathy and mere words--giving a lifetime of holy service for the sake
   of those whose cause He had espoused and going further even than
   this--doing for them the utmost that a Friend can do, for what is there
   more than that a man should lay down his life for his friend? Friend of
   man and, therefore, born of man. Friend of sinners and, therefore,
   living among them and ministering to them. Friend of sinners and,
   therefore, taking their sin upon Himself and bearing it "in His own
   body on the tree," so fulfilling Gabriel's prophecy that He would come
   "to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
   reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
   righteousness."

   Christ has done for us all that needed to be done! He has done much
   more than we ever could have asked Him to do, or expected Him to do. He
   has done more for us than we can understand, even now that He has done
   it, and more than you and I are likely everto understand even when our
   intellect shall have been developed and enlarged to the utmost degree
   before the eternal Throne of God, for even there I do not think we
   shall ever fully know how much we owe to the friendship of our best
   Friend! However self-denying and tender other friends may be, our Lord
   must always stand at the head of the list and we will not put a second
   there as worthy of any comparison with Him!

   It is a very blessed thing, next, to have the Lord Jesus Christ as
   having been our father's Friend. There are some of us to whom this has
   been literally true for many generations. I suppose that there is some
   pride in being the 14th earl, or the 10th duke, or having a certain
   rank among men. But, sometimes, quietly to myself, I glory in my
   pedigree because I can trace the line of spiritual Grace back as far as
   I can go to men who loved the Lord and who, many of them, have preached
   His Word. Many of you, I know, in this Church, and in other Churches,
   have a glorious heraldry in the line of the Lord's nobles. It is true
   that some of you have had the great mercy of being taken, like trees
   out of the desert, and planted in the courts of our God, for which you
   may well be glad. But others of you are slips from vines that, in their
   turn, were slips from other vines loved and cared for by the great
   Husbandman! You cannot tell how long this blessed succession has
   continued--your fathers, and your fathers' fathers, as far back as you
   can trace them, were friends of Christ! Happy Eph-raim, whose father
   Joseph had God with him! Happy Joseph, whose father Jacob saw God at
   Bethel! Happy Jacob, whose father Isaac walked in the fields and
   meditated in communion with Jehovah! Happy Isaac, whose father Abraham
   had spoken with God and was called "the Friend of God!" God has a habit
   of loving families. David said, "The mercy of the Lord is from
   everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, and His
   righteousness unto children's children; to such as keep His covenant,
   and to those that remember His commandments to do them." Grace does not
   run in the blood, but often the stream of Divine Mercy has run side by
   side with it and, instead of the fathers, have been the children whom
   the Lord has made to be princes in the earth!

   Some of you, perhaps, have fathers and mothers still living, whose
   example you may fitly follow. I charge you, never forsake your father's
   God, or, what is still more tender, the God of your mother! Others of
   you have parents in Heaven. Well, they are still yours--that sacred
   relationship is not broken. You remember your mother's last grasp of
   your hand when she bade you follow her to Heaven. You recollect your
   father's appeals to you, in his long sickness, when he pleaded with you
   to take heed to your ways and not neglect the things of God, but seek
   Him in the days of your youth. Well, did you ever hear your father say
   anything against his God? Did your mother ever, in her confiding
   moments, whisper in your ear, "Mary, do not trust in God, for He has
   betrayed your mother's confidence"? No! I know they did not talk like
   that, for He was their best Friend and He who was such a Friend to the
   dear old man whom you can never forget. He who cheered the heart of
   that gracious matron whose sweet face rises before you now--oh, I
   beseech you, forsake Him not! "Your own Friend, and your father's
   Friend, forsake not."

   Still, the sweetest part of the text lies in these words, " Your own
   Friend." I do not think that I can preach on those words. I can take
   them in my mouth and they are like honey for sweetness, but they must
   be personallyenjoyed to be fully appreciated. There are some precious
   lines we sometimes sing--

   "The health is of my countenance, Yes, my own God is He"-- which
   exactly describe the blessedness of "your own Friend."

   Now, if it is true that Christ is your own Friend, then you have spoken
   with Him. You have held sweet conversations with Him, you have placed
   your confidence in Him, you have told Him your lost estate and
   sinfulness and you have reposed in Him as your own Savior. You have put
   your cause into His hands and you have left it there. If He is, indeed,
   your own Friend, then He has helped you. You were a stranger and He has
   taken you in. You were naked and He has clothed you. You were
   spiritually sick and in prison, and He came to you and healed you. Yes,
   and He wore your chains and bade you go free! And He took your
   sicknesses and bade you take His health--and so He made you whole. Yes,
   and He restored you even from the grave--and went into that grave,
   Himself, that by His death, you might live! You know that it is so and
   day by day you keep up communion with Him--you could not live without
   Him, for He is such a Friend to you, and you rest on Him with all your
   weight as you come up from the wilderness with Him, leaning on your
   Beloved, "your own Friend."

   Nor is the friendship all on one side, though your side is a very
   little one. You would make it greater if it were in your power, for you
   have confessed His name, you have united yourself with His people, you
   love to join with them in prayer and praise. You are not ashamed to be
   called by Christ's name as a Christian, or to speak well of that name,
   and you desire to consecrate to Him all that you have. Better than all
   this, while you do call Him, Friend, He also calls you, Friend, as He
   said to His disciples, "You are My friends, if you do whatever I
   command you." Dare I say the words, yet, dare I doubt the truth of the
   words--Jesus is my Friend? There is one we read of in the Bible who was
   David's captain of the host, and there was another who was David's
   counselor. But there was one man whom we always call, "David's friend,
   Jonathan." And I envy him such a title. Yet Jesus gives this name to
   all those who come and put their trust in Him and so find Him to be
   their Friend!

   Now, inasmuch as the Lord Jesus is "your own Friend, and your father's
   Friend," the injunction of the text comes to you with peculiar
   force--"Forsake Him not." Can you forsake Him? Look at His face, all
   red with bloody sweat for you. Nor His face, alone, for He is covered
   all over with that gory robe wherein He worked out your redemption. He
   that works for bread must sweat, but He that worked for your eternal
   life did sweat great drops of blood falling down to the ground! Can you
   forsake Him? He stands at Pilate's bar, He is mocked by Herod's men of
   war. He is scourged by Pilate, and all for you--and can you forsake
   Him? He goes up to the Cross of Calvary and the cruel iron is driven
   through His hands and feet and there He makes expiation for your guilt.
   He is your Friend, even to the ignominy of a felon's death-- and can
   you forsake Him? He lays His pierced hand on you and He says, "Will
   you, also, go away?" Or, as He worded it to the twelve, "You also will
   not go away, will you?" So it might be read, "Many of my supposed
   friends have gone and so have proved themselves to be not friends, but
   traitors. But you, also, will not go away, will you?" And He seems to
   make an appeal to them with those tearful, tender eyes of His--"as the
   eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly
   set"--"You also will not go away, will you?"

   And when you turn your eyes another way and think not merely of the
   shame your Friend endured for you, but recollect what is an equal proof
   of His love--that He is not ashamed of you now that He is in His Glory!
   Amidst the throng of angels and cherubim and seraphim that frequent His
   courts above He does not disdain to know that He is the Brother of
   these poor earthworms down below, for even there He wears the body
   which proves Him to be our next of kin--yes, and wears the scars which
   proved that for us He endured the death penalty, itself, and even now
   He is not ashamed to call us Brethren! As you think of all this, can
   you forsake Him? Because you are somewhat better off than you once
   were, will you leave the little gathering of poor folk with whom you
   used to worship so happily, and will you go to some more fashionable
   place where there is music, but little of the music of the name of
   Jesus--where there is gorgeous architecture, it may be, and
   masquerading, and mummery and I know not what, but little of the sweet
   savor of His Presence, and the dropping of that dew which He always
   brings with Him wherever He comes? Oh, it is a pity, it is a sorrowful
   pity, it is a meanness that would disgrace a mere worldling--when a man
   who once confessed Christ and followed Him--must turn his back upon his
   Lord because his own coat is made of better material than it used to
   be, and his balance at the bank is heavier! I had almost said--"Then
   let the Judas go, be his own place what it may--it were almost a
   dishonor to Christ to wish the traitor back!

   Oh, will you go away, either from the Crucified or from the Glorified?
   If you will forsake this Friend, "Behold, He comes!" Every hour brings
   Him nearer! The chariots of His Glory have glowing axles and you may
   almost hear them as they speed toward us! And then what will you do
   when you have forsaken your own Friend and your father's Friend, and
   you hear Him say, "I never knew you; I never knew you"? God grant that
   it may never be the lot of any of us here present to hear those awful
   words!

   II. Now I pass on to our second head, as the Holy Spirit may help me.
   It is, SUGGESTIVE ADVICE--"Your own Friend, and your father's Friend,
   forsake not."

   There is, to me, in the text, a suggestion which the text itself does
   not suggest. That is to say, it suggests something by not suggesting
   it. The text does not suggest to me that my own Friend and my father's
   Friend will ever forsake me. It seems to hint that I may forsake Him,
   but it does not suggest that He will ever forsake me--and He never
   will! If the Lord had ever meant to forsake me, He has had so many good
   reasons for doing it that He would have done it long ago! The Apostle
   says of those who are journeying to the better country that, "if they
   had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might
   have had opportunity to have returned." And, certainly, our blessed
   Lord and Master, if He had desired to leave us to perish, had many an
   opportunity to return to Heaven before He died. And, since then He has
   had many more occasions when He might have said, "I really must
   withdraw My friendship from you," if He had ever wished to do so. But
   His love is constant--"Having loved His own which were in the world, He
   loved them unto the end." His is a friendship which never changes! You
   shall never fall back on Him and find that He has withdrawn the arms
   with which He formerly upheld you. You shall find, in life and in
   death, that "there is a Friend that sticks closer than a brother." Let
   us be cheered by the assurance that He will never forsake us!

   Now let us go on to what the text doessuggest in so many words. It
   suggests to us the question, In what sense can we forsake Christ? Well,
   there is more than one sense in which a man may forsake Christ. Two
   passages rise to my mind at this moment. "Then all the disciples
   forsook Him and fled." That was one sort of forsaking--they were all
   afraid and ran away from their Lord in the hour of His betrayal into
   the hands of sinners. But it is quite another kind of forsaking when we
   read, "From that time many of His disciples went back and walked no
   more with Him." The first forsaking was the result of a sudden fear,
   much to be deplored and very blameworthy, but still, only temporary in
   its effects. The other was the deliberate act of those who, in cold
   blood, refused to accept Jesus Christ's doctrine, or to follow Him any
   farther, and so turned back and walked no more with Him. This last
   forsaking is incurable. The former one was cured almost as soon as the
   sudden fear that caused it was removed, for we find John and even Peter
   following the Master to the judgment hall and the whole of the
   disciples soon gathered around Him after His Resurrection.

   I would say to you, dear Friends, "Your own Friend, and your father's
   Friend, forsake not" in any sense at all. Forsake Him not even in your
   moments of alarm. Pray God that then you may play the man and not
   forsake Him and flee. And then, in the other sense, let no quarrel ever
   arise between you and Christ's most precious Truth so as to lead you
   deliberately to leave Him, for this is the worst of all kinds of
   forsaking! If we never forsake Him in any sense at all, then it is
   quite certain that we shall never forsake Him in the worst sense. I
   remember a little merriment I had with a good Wesleyan brother, the
   clerk of the works, when the Tabernacle was being built. He wanted me
   to go up a ladder right into those lantern lights and I said, "No,
   thank you. I would rather not." "But," he replied, "I thought you had
   no fear of falling." "Yes," I answered, "that is quite true. I have no
   fear of finally falling away, but the belief that the Lord will
   preserve me does not exercise any evil influence over me, for it keeps
   me from running unnecessary risks by climbing up ladders! But you, good
   Brother, who are so afraid of falling, do not seem to show it
   practically in your conduct, for you go up and down the ladders as
   nimbly as possible."

   I have sometimes met with persons who think that if we believe that we
   shall never fall so as to perish, we are apt to become
   presumptuous--but we do not, dear Brothers and Sisters! There are other
   Truths of God that come in to balance this one, so that what they think
   might come of it is, by God's good Grace, prevented. And I am not quite
   sure that those who think that they may finally fall and perish are
   sufficiently impressed with that belief so as to always be careful. The
   fact is, that your carefulness of walk does not depend merely upon your
   view of this doctrine or that, but it depends upon your state of heart
   and a great many other things--so that you have no reason to judge what
   you might do if you believed such-and-such a Truth of God, because if
   you did believe it, perhaps you would, at the same time, be a better
   man--and the possibility that appears to linger around the doctrine
   would vanish so far as you are concerned. Let this be the language of
   all of us who love the Lord, as we look up confidently and reverently
   to Him--

   "We have no fear that You should lose One whom eternal love could
   choose,

   But we would ne'er this Grace abuse. Let us not fall. Let us not fall!"

   I know that if we are truly the Lord's, He will not allow us to forsake
   Him. But I must have a wholesome fear lest I should forsake Him, for
   who am I that I should be sure that I have not deceived myself? I may
   have done so and, after all, may forsake Him after the loudest
   professions, and even after the greatest apparent sincerity in vowing
   that I never will turn away from Him.

   So, I ask again--In what sense can we forsake our Lord? Well, there are
   many senses, but perhaps you will see better what I mean if I describe
   a general process of forsaking a friend. I hope that you have never had
   to undergo it. I do not know that I ever have, but, still, I can
   imagine that it is something like this. The old gentleman was your
   father's friend. He also had been your own friend and has done you many
   a good turn. But, at last, he has said something which has provoked you
   to anger, or he has done something which you have misunderstood or
   misinterpreted--and now you feel very cool towards him when you meet.
   You pass the time of day and, perhaps, say very much the same things
   which you used to say, but they are said in a very different fashion.
   Now, that is how we begin to forsake our God. We may keep up the
   appearance of friendship with Christ, but it is a very cool affair. We
   go to a place of worship, but there is no enjoyment, no enthusiasm, no
   earnestness.

   Then the next thing is that you do not call to see your friend as
   frequently as you used to do. It has not come to an open rupture
   between you, so you do look in at certain set times when you are
   expected, but there are none of those little flying visits and that
   popping in upon him unawares, just to get a look at his face as you
   used to do. And, on his part, he does not come to see you much, either.
   And that is how our forsaking of Christ generally continues. We do not
   go to talk with Him as we once did, and when we do go to His House, we
   find that He is not there. "Can two walk together, except they be
   agreed?" Then, by-and-by, perhaps there is a sharp word spoken, and
   your friend feels that you do not need him. You have said something
   that cuts him to the quick and grieves him. It was not anything so very
   bad if it had been spoken to a stranger--but to be said to him who was
   your father's friend, to him whom you always expected to come in and
   whom you loved to see--to say it to him was very hard and he naturally
   took offense at it.

   That is how it comes to pass between Christ and professors. There is
   something done which might not be of so much account in the case of
   non-professors or the openly ungodly, but it is very bad in one who
   professed to have Christ for his Friend. And do you know what happens,
   by-and-by, when your friend is being discarded? At last he does not
   call at all--and you do not go to see him. Perhaps the breach is still
   further widened and little presents are sent back or treated with
   contempt. There is that oil painting which your father would have,
   though he could scarcely afford it, because he loved his friend so
   much, and which he hung up in so conspicuous a place in his house.
   Well, the other day, the string broke and you did not buy a fresh piece
   of cord to hang it up again. In fact, you put the picture away in the
   cellar and you do not really care what becomes of it! The little tokens
   of past affection are all put away, for there is an open rupture, now,
   and when somebody spoke to you about him, lately, you said, "Oh, pray
   don't mention him to me! He is no friend of mine now! I used to be on
   intimate terms with him, once, but I have altered my opinion about him
   altogether."

   So do some professors act towards the Lord Jesus Christ. Those little
   tokens of love which they thought they had from Him, they send back.
   They do not remain in fellowship with His Church. They do all that they
   possibly can to disown Him. In the meanwhile, the blessed Lord of Love
   is obliged to disown them, too! And His Church disowns them. And,
   by-and-by, the rupture has become complete. May that never be the
   portion of any of you!

   "No," says one, "it never will be." My dear Friend, if you are so
   confident as that, you are the person about whom I am most afraid! I
   remember one who used to pray among us, but we had to put him out of
   the Church for evil living. And there was one of our members who said,
   that night, "If that man is not a child of God, I am not one, myself."
   I said, "My dear Brother, do not talk like that. I would not pit my
   soul against the soul of any man, for I do know a little of myself, but
   I do not know other men as well as I know myself." I am very much
   afraid that neither of the two men I have mentioned was a child of God.
   By their speech they seemed to be Christians, but their acts were not
   like those of God's people. It does not do for us to talk as that man
   did, but to pray to the Lord, "Hold me up and I shall be safe." That is
   the proper prayer for us--or else it may happen even to us as happened
   to them--and we may forsake our own Friend and our father's Friend.

   Now, what reasons can we possibly have for forsaking Christ? We ought
   to do nothing for which we cannot give good reasons. I have known
   persons very properly forsake their former friends because they have,
   themselves, become new creatures in Christ Jesus and they have, rightly
   and wisely, given up the acquaintances with whom they used to sin. They
   cannot go, now, to the house where everything is contrary to their
   feelings. But it is not so with Christ. Some so-called friends drag a
   man down, lower him, injure him, impose upon him and, at last, he is
   obliged to let them go. But we cannot say that of Christ. His
   friendship has drawn us up, helped us, sanctified us, elevated us--we
   owe everything to that friendship! We cannot have a reason, therefore,
   for forsaking this Friend. I have known some to outgrow an acquaintance
   or friend. They really have not been able to continue to have common
   views and sympathies, for, while their friend has remained in the mire,
   they have risen into quite different men by reason of education and
   other influences. But we can never outgrow Christ. That is not
   possible! And the more we grow in a right sense, the more we shall
   become like He. A man who has been the friend of our father and of
   ourselves is the very man to still have as a friend because he probably
   understands all about the family difficulties, the family troubles and
   he also understands us. Why, he nursed us when we were children and,
   therefore, he knows most about us. I remember that, when lying sorely
   sick, I had a letter from a kind old gentleman who said that he had,
   that day, celebrated his 80th birthday, and the choicest friend he had
   at his dinner table was the old family doctor. He said, "He has
   attended to me so long that he thoroughly knows my constitution. He is
   nearly as old as myself, but the first time I was ill I saw him and he
   has attended me, now, for 40 years. Once," he said, "when I had a
   severe attack of gout, I was tempted to try some very famous man who
   very nearly killed me and, until I got back to my old friend, I was
   never really well again."

   So he wrote to advise me to get some really good physician and let him
   know my constitution and to stick to him, and never go off to any of
   the patent medicines or the quacks of the day! Oh, but there is a great
   deal of truth in that in a spiritual sense! With the utmost reverence,
   we may say that the Lord Jesus Christ has been our family Physician.
   Did He not attend my father in all his sicknesses, and my grandfather,
   too? And He knows the ins and outs of my constitution-- He knows my
   ways, good and bad, and all my sorrows and, therefore I do not go to
   anyone else for relief. And I advise you, also, to keep to Jesus
   Christ, do not forsake Him! If you are ever tempted to go aside, even
   for a little while, I pray that you may have Grace enough to come back
   quickly and to commit yourself again to Him, and never go astray again.
   There is the blessing of having One who is wise, One who is tried, One
   whose sympathy has been tested, One who has become, as it were, one of
   your family, One who has taken your whole household to His heart and
   made it part and parcel of Himself. Such a Friend to your own soul, and
   to your father's soul, forsake not!

   Do not forsake Him, dear Friends, because, I almost tremble to say
   it--you will need Him some day. Even if you would never need Him in the
   future, you ought not to forsake Him. I do not quite like that verse of
   the hymn at the end of our hymn book--

   "Ashamed of Jesus! Yes, I may, When I've no guilt to wash away, No tear
   to wipe, no good to crave, No fears to quell, no soul to save."

   No, I may not When all my guilt is gone, I shall not be ashamed of
   Jesus. When I am in Heaven and need no more the pardon of sin, I
   certainly shall not be ashamed of Him who brought me there! No, but I
   shall glory in Him more than ever! Your friendship to Christ, and mine,
   ought not to depend upon what we are going to get out of Him. We must
   love Him now for what He is, for all that He has already done, and for
   His own blessed Person and personal beauties which every day should
   hold fast our love, and bind us in chains of affection to Him.

   But suppose you do think of forsaking Christ, where are you going to
   get another Friend to take His place? You must have a friend of some
   sort--who is going to sit in Christ's chair? Whose portrait is to be
   hung up in the old familiar place when the old Friend is discarded? To
   whom are you going to tell your griefs and from whom will you expect to
   receive help in time of need? Who will be with you in sickness? Who
   will be with you in the hour of death? Ah, there is no other who can
   ever fill the vacuum which the absence of Christ would make! Therefore,
   never forsake Him.

   III. Now I must close with THE CONSEQUENT RESOLVE about which I can say
   very little, as my time has gone.

   Let this be your resolve, by His Grace, instead of forsaking Him, you
   will cling to Him more closely than ever You will acknowledge Him when
   it brings you dishonor to do so. You will trust Him when He wounds you,
   for "faithful are the wounds of a friend." You will serve Him when it
   is costly to do it, when it involves self-denial, resolved that, by the
   help of His ever-blessed Spirit, without whom you can do nothing, you
   will never, in any sort of company, conceal the fact that you are a
   Christian! Never, under any possible circumstances, wish to be
   otherwise than a servant of such a Master, a friend of such a Lord!
   Come now, dear young friends who are getting cool towards Christ, and
   elder friends to whom religion is becoming monotonous--come to your
   Lord once more and ask Him to bind you with cords, even with cords to
   the horns of the altar! You have had time to count the cost of all
   Egypt's treasure--forego it and forswear it once and for all. But the
   riches of Christ you can never count--so come and take Him again to be
   your All-in-All!

   Those about to be baptized will feel, I trust--as we shall when we look
   on--and say, each man and woman for himself, or herself--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done! I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine."

   Nail your colors to the mast! Bear in your body the marks of the Lord
   Jesus. Yes, let everyone of us who has been baptized into Christ feel
   that our whole body bears the watermark, for we have been "buried with
   Him by baptism into death." It was not for the putting off of the
   filthiness of the flesh, but as a declaration that we were dead to the
   world and quickened into newness of life in Christ Jesus our Savior. So
   let it be with you, too, dear Friends, as you follow your Lord through
   the water! Cling to Him, cleave to Him! "Your own Friend, and your
   father's Friend, forsake not." May God add His blessing, for our Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN15:9-27.

   Verse 9. As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Oh, drink
   this nectar down! It is as when Cleopatra dissolved the pearl into a
   single draught, for here is the choicest pearl of the Truths of God
   that was ever dissolved into a single verse to be a delicious draught
   for His people to drink! "As the Father has loved Me"--as surely as the
   Father has loved Me and, then, "as"--that is--in the same manner "as
   the Father has loved Me"--without beginning, without ending, without
   measure, without change, "so have I loved you."

   9, 10. Continue you in My love. If you keep My commandments, you shall
   abide in My love. Note this point of the Lord's discipline--not that
   Christ ever casts away His people, but that He does take from them the
   sweet sense of His love, the realization of it, if they are disobedient
   to Him and keep not His commandments.

   10, 11. Even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His
   love. These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in
   you. That He might joy in us--feel a sacred delight in thinking of us
   as He does when He sees us keeping His commandments and treasuring up
   His Words, and so living in His love and being mighty in prayer.

   11, And that your joy might be full. If Christ is not pleased with us,
   we cannot be glad. And if He has no joy in us, we cannot have joy in
   Him. These two things rise and fall together. When the father of the
   family looks with joy upon his boy, then the boy is happy. But when the
   father has no joy in his son, then be sure of this, the son has no joy
   in his father, but he is sad at heart. O God, may we never grieve You,
   for if we do, we shall be grieved! At least, I trust that we shall-- we
   would not have it otherwise. But, oh, that we might have the testimony
   that Enoch had before his translation, that we have pleased God! Then
   shall we have true pleasure in ourselves.

   12-14. This is My commandment, That you love one another, as I have
   loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his
   life for his friends. You are My friends if you do whatever I command
   you. Obedience, then, is rewarded with a holy friendship, for Christ
   becomes in the highest sense our Friend! But we are not His friends
   till we cease to delight in sin and turn away from it into the paths of
   holiness.

   15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what
   his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I
   have heard of My Father I have made known unto you. The servant works
   in a building and it is enough for him that he is laying part of a line
   of brick or stone. Perhaps he has never seen the design of the
   structure, nor had a wish to do so. But you and I have the great
   Architect constantly coming to us to tell us what the building is to be
   and to explain to us His plans--and so we work with greater pleasure
   and joy than a mere laborer might. The very heart of Christ is laid
   bare to His people. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
   Him." Happy are His people--glad to be His servants--more glad, still,
   to be His friends!

   16. You have not chosen Me, but Ihave chosen you, and ordainedyou,
   thatyou shouldgo and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
   remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name, He may
   give it to you. There you see Divine Election leading on to
   fruit-bearing and perpetuated in perseverance--"that your fruit should
   remain." It brings to every one of its objects this conspicuous favor,
   prevailing power in prayer--"that whatever you shall ask of the Father
   in My name, He may give it to you."

   17. These things I command you, thatyou love one another O you
   professors who have no love to one another, you are breaking the King's
   commandment! You are living in direct violation of a plain command that
   is most dear to His heart. Oh, that we might constantly hear it and
   obey it! "These things I command you, that you love one another."

   18. If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated
   you. That is what you have reason to expect, and you may feel honored
   if they treat you as they have treated your Lord.

   19-22. If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but
   because you are not of the world, but Ihave chosen you out of the
   world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said
   unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have
   persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My
   saying, they will keep your's also. But all these things will they do
   unto you for My name's sake, because they know not Him that sent Me. If
   I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they
   have no cloak for their sin. There is an awful increase of sin produced
   by Christ appearing to a man. And if any of you have been very near to
   the Kingdom, and your conscience has been awakened, and your mind has
   been impressed by the Truth of God and yet you have gone back to your
   sin, you have multiplied that sin a thousand-fold! The times of your
   ignorance God may have winked at, but now you are sinning against the
   Light of God and knowledge--and unless you repent, your doom will be
   terrible!

   23-26. He that hates Me, hates My Father, also. If I had not done among
   them the works which no other man did, they had not had sin: but now
   have they both seen and hated both Me and My Father But this came to
   pass that the word might be fulfiled that is written in their law, They
   hated Me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come. And He has
   come! He is here! He has never been taken away! He still abides with
   and in the Church!

   26. Whom I'll send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth,
   which proceeds from the Father, He shall testify of Me. By this mark
   you may know whether that which has been taught you is of the Spirit of
   God. If it does not testify of Christ--if He is not the head and front
   of it all--there is nothing in it for you to accept. If any man comes
   to you with what he calls a revelation, if it is not all concerning
   Christ, by this shall you judge it--it is not of the Spirit of God if
   it does not testify of Christ.

   27. And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with Me from
   the beginning. May we all bear witness according as we have been with
   Christ, for there is no bearing witness to Christ unless we have first
   been with Him.

"All Hail!"

   (No. 2628)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 25, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   5, 1882.

   "And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
   saying, All hail! So they came and held Him by the feet and worshipped
   Him. Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid. Go and tell My brethren to
   go into Galilee, and there will they see Me." Matthew 28:9,10.

   ON Sabbath mornings, lately, we have been meditating upon the sorrows
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have been, in thought, traveling with Him
   from dark Gethsemane to still darker Golgotha. We have pictured Him
   under accusation before Caiaphas, Herod and Pilate. We have, in
   imagination, heard the cruel shouts of the Jews, "Away with Him!
   Crucify Him!" These solemn events have been full of pain to us--even
   the bliss that comes to us through the Cross of Christ has been toned
   down with intense sorrow as we have thought of the agonies our Savior
   endured there. But as soon as we get to the other side of the Cross and
   realize that Christ has risen from the dead, everything is calm, quiet
   and peaceful! There are none of those rough winds and stormy blasts
   that come sweeping around us as we stand outside Pilate's palace and
   Herod's judgment hall. All is spring-like--summer-like, if you
   will--yes, and autumn-like, for there are most luscious fruits to be
   gathered in the garden wherein was a new sepulcher out of which the
   living Christ arose in all the glory of His resurrection from the dead!

   There was just one painful memory during the interview which Christ had
   with His disciples, when he said to Peter the third time, "Simon, son
   of Jonas, do you love Me?" And "Peter was grieved because He said unto
   him the third time, Do you love Me?" But all the rest of the
   manifestations of our Lord to His disciples were singularly placid,
   joyful, restful.

   So, dear Friends, I want it to be with you, now, as you enter into the
   spirit of the scene described in our text. I pray that the Master may
   set you on the other side of the sepulcher and make you feel as if He
   breathed upon you as He breathed upon His disciples and said to you as
   He said to them, "Peace be unto you!" We need this experience, at least
   sometimes, for while the lessons to be learned at Calvary are
   inestimably precious and it is beyond all things necessary to sorrow
   over our sin as we see how we are reconciled to God by the death of His
   Son, yet we must ardently desire to gather all the fruit that grows
   even on the accursed tree--and part of that fruit will give us the
   sweet rest of reconciliation through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

   This is the time for fellowship with your Lord, Beloved. You cannot
   tread the winepress with Him. You cannot pour out your blood to mingle
   with His, for the Atonement is complete and needs no suffering on your
   part--anything added to it would spoil it. But now, on the other side
   of the tomb, you can stand beside your risen Savior. He can come into
   our midst and say, as He has often done, "Peace be unto you!" As we
   journey to our homes after this service, we can walk and talk with Him
   as they did who went to Emmaus in company with Him. We can take Him
   with us into our daily labors, on the morrow, even as He went to the
   sea where His disciples were fishing and taught them how to catch a
   multitude of fish. Familiar acquaintance with Christ should spring out
   of the fact that He is no longer dead, that He is not, now, in the
   grave, but that He has risen in fullness of life and that, most
   wonderful Truth of all, that life is in all His people!

   I. Our meditation upon this text will, I trust, help us to enjoy
   fellowship with Christ. Read the beginning of it and learn from it this
   first lesson. THE LORD JESUS OFTEN MEETS WITH HIS PEOPLE IN THE WAY OF
   HOLY SERVICE. "As they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met
   them."

   My Brother said, just now in prayer, that we do not expect to actually
   meet Jesus in flesh and blood, but we know that there is a great
   blessedness in store for those who have not seen Him with their mortal
   eyes and yet have believed in Him. But we do expect to meet Him, after
   a spiritual fashion, so that faith can recognize Him. No, more, we know
   that He is here in His real, though invisible Presence. We may expect
   this blessed experience when we are in the way of holy service. I grant
   you that our Lord Jesus comes to us at other times as well--

   "Sometimes a light surprises

   The Christian while he sings--

   It is the Lord who rises

   With healing in His wings!"

   Yes, and sometimes the light of the Sun of Righteousness surprises the
   Christian when he cannot sing! "Before I was aware," says the sweet
   singer of the blessed Canticle--"Before I was aware, my soul made me
   like the chariots of Ammi-nadib," for the Presence of Christ may be
   suddenly manifested to His people--and they may be as though they were
   caught away altogether from earthly scenes--and were with Christ in the
   Heavenly places!

   We have known this to happen, sometimes, in the lonely night watches.
   And we have said with David, "When I awake, I am still with You," even
   in the darkness of the night. We have known it to happen in the very
   midst of the hurry and worry of business. All of a sudden everything
   has been calm and quiet. We could not make it out--it seemed like a
   Sabbath in the middle of the week--a very oasis in the wilderness! The
   Lord Jesus Christ has come to some of us when we have been amidst the
   busy throng in Cheapside. In fact, there is nothing but sin that can
   keep Him away from us since He is not dependent upon the ordinary rules
   that regulate the movement of earthly bodies. He was not so on earth
   after He had risen from the dead, for though I doubt not that He often
   came and went just as others did, yet, at other times, He came like an
   apparition, "the doors being shut," and He could be here and there at
   His own sweet will, passing from place to place, holding the eyes of
   those to whom He was nearest, or opening their eyes just when He
   pleased to do so!

   And that is how He acts toward us now. Do not some of you remember when
   Christ first appeared to you? Ah, it is years ago with some of us, but
   we mind the place, the spot of ground where Jesus first manifested
   Himself to us. The joy of marriage--the joy of harvest--these were as
   nothing compared with the joy that came to us from the vision of His
   face! Many days have passed since then and we have had fresh
   visitations from Him. He has come to us, and come again, and yet again.
   He has not been a stranger to us and now some of us can say that we are
   not strangers to Him, for He is our dear familiar Friend! Yet there are
   times, even with those who dwell with Him, when the light is clearer
   and the voice is nearer, and the sense of His Presence is more
   delightful than usual.

   These times, I say, come by Christ's own appointment whenever He
   pleases, yet I again remind you of the lesson we learn from our text,
   which is, that we may expect these visits from Christ when we are going
   about His business. These devoted women had been to the sepulcher and
   had there seen "the angel of the Lord," who had bid them go quickly and
   tell His disciples that He was risen from the dead and would meet them
   in Galilee. So they hastened with all their might to tell the cheering
   tidings to the sorrowing followers of Jesus! "And as they went to tell
   His disciples, behold, Jesus met them." It is better to be actively
   working for Christ than to sit still and read, and study, and hope to
   enjoy His company. There must be alternations between the contemplative
   and the active life of a Christian! Sometimes it is best to sit quietly
   with Mary and leave Martha and the dishes alone. But, at another time
   it is better to bestir yourself and to run here and there with all the
   diligence of a Martha, for then Jesus will be most likely to meet with
   you.

   I notice--and I think that my observation is correct--that my Brothers
   and Sisters who do most for Christ know most about Him and have most
   fellowship with Him. The Sunday school teacher, diligent in his class
   and weary, perhaps, now that the Sabbath is well-nigh spent, yet
   rejoicing that he has set forth Christ before his class, is the one to
   whom the Lord will come and manifest Himself! The man who has been
   preaching in the street, or going from door to door trying to speak for
   Christ by a tract or by his own voice--and all of you, indeed, who have
   done anything for your Lord and Master--are the most likely persons for
   Him to meet with at this time.

   I have known some who have been for years members of churches, but who
   have never done anything for the Savior. They are the kind of people
   who do not get on with my ministry very long--they say that they are
   not able to feed upon it. They are generally wanderers who go about
   from one place to another looking for new light--and they never get to
   be very happy or very useful. Nor do they often have much communion
   with Christ. No, our Lord is very choice in His company and He does not
   frequent the house of the sluggard! But wherever there is one who
   spends and is spent for Jesus, there we may expect that Jesus will be!
   If we heartily serve Him, the state of mind into which we shall be
   brought will be congenial to His own--fellowship will be likely between
   the laboring Savior and His laboring servant. Follow the example of Him
   who went about doing good and you will thus be in sympathy with
   Him--and you will find that He will come and walk with you because you
   two are agreed!

   That is certainly one reason why Christ comes to those who are busy
   about His errands--because He is in agreement with them and they are,
   therefore, traveling on the right road to meet with Him. "If any man
   will not work, neither shall he eat," is a rule that Christ observes.
   And those who will not work for Him get but scant morsels from Him. Few
   of the bits my Brother spoke of, that are dipped in the dish with
   Christ, come to those who never lift a hand to do Him any service. But
   if He brings us into loving obedience, into joyful alacrity and sacred
   earnestness in doing His will, then it is that He will, in all
   probability, meet with us by the way and manifest Himself to us. Sit
   down, then, you who have come to the end of another day of holy
   service, and pray, "Jesus, Master, come and meet us now." Oh, that you
   might feel as though He stood behind you and looked over your
   shoulder--as if the shadow of the Christ fell upon you and you felt,
   even now, His pierced hand touching you--and that prostrate at His feet
   your spirit might lie, holding Him by the feet and worshipping Him!

   I do not feel as if I need to preach upon this subject. I want only to
   set you longing for larger and deeper communion with Christ and
   aspiring after it--especially you to whom this Sabbath has been a day
   of service, from which service, perhaps, you have not as yet seen any
   good come. You have come from the field weary--not weary ofit, though
   weary in it--for you are still ready to serve your Lord. Now I want you
   to feel that Christ is here and that He comes to commune with you.

   II. So we advance a step to our second remark. WHEN JESUS MEETS US, HE
   ALWAYS HAS A GOOD WORD FOR US. "Jesus met them, saying, All hail!"

   That is, first, a word of salutation, as if He had said, "Welcome,
   Friends! Glad to see you, Friends! All hail, My Friends!" There is
   nothing cold and formal about that word--it seems full of the warmth of
   brotherly kindness and affectionate condescension. "All hail!" says our
   Lord to the women. "You are glad to see Me, and I am glad to see you.
   'All hail!'" How much more sweet that sounds than that bitter sarcasm
   of the soldiers, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And yet it seems almost like
   an echo of it, as though Christ caught up the cruel word, crushed the
   bitterness out of it and then gave it back full of delicious sweetness
   to the holy women before Him. "All hail!" He says. "All hail!"

   My dear Christian Brother or Sister, would you be glad to see the
   Savior if He could now be made visible to you? Yet you would not be so
   glad to see Him as He would be to see you! He is very dear to you, but
   He is not so dear to you as you are to Him! Out of two friends, the
   greater affection is always found in the one who has conferred the most
   favors upon the other. I will not dare to compare, for a moment, the
   love which exists between you and Christ, for what have you ever done
   for Him compared with what He has done for you? He loves you more than
   you can ever love Him. Well, then, He says, "All hail! I am glad, My
   Sister--I am glad, My Brother--I am glad, my Friend, that you have come
   up to this place where My people meet. All hail! I welcome you."

   Besides being a word of salutation, it is a word of benediction. Our
   Lord, by this expression, seems to say, "All health be to
   you--everything that can do you good! I wish for you every good thing."
   He speaks it to you, Believer. "May you have the haleness, the
   wholeness that makes holiness and, so may it be all well with you--all
   hale with you!"

   Then it is also a word of congratulation, for some render it,
   "Rejoice," and, indeed, that is the meaning of the term--"Let us joy
   and rejoice together." Jesus gives to you, Beloved, this watchword as
   He meets you--"Rejoice." The children in your class are not yet all
   converted. Nevertheless, rejoice in Christ. All in the congregation,
   about whom some of us are concerned, are not saved. Nevertheless, let
   us rejoice in Christ. You, yourself, cannot run as quickly on your
   Lord's errands as you wish you could. Nevertheless, rejoice in Christ
   Jesus, though you can have no confidence in the flesh. It is a blessed
   thing when it becomes a sacred duty to be glad. What man to whom our
   Lord Jesus Christ says, "Rejoice," can have an excuse for misery? So,
   "All hail!" is a word of congratulation.

   And, according to some versions, it may be read, "Peace be unto you!"
   That is a word of pacification--as though our Lord had said, "Ah, you
   women did not run away from Me as the men did. But, still, you were
   afraid and very timid. Sad though you were at the sepulcher, you went
   there trembling. You did not believe My Word, or you scarcely believed
   it--that I would rise from the dead--but I am not going to have any
   back reckonings with you. 'Peace be to you!'"

   Now, dear Friends, have you heard your Lord and Savior say to you, "It
   is all forgiven--every omission and every commission, every slip and
   every fault--all the lukewarmness and all the coldness is all gone"?
   That is the meaning of the greeting, "All hail!" from the lips of
   Christ. "There is nothing between Me and you, dear Heart, but perfect
   peace and unbroken love. I rejoice to see you and I would have you
   rejoice, and rest, and be quiet, for I have come near unto you, to
   bless and cheer you."

   That is the second lesson I learn from the text. First, that, when we
   are running on our Master's errands, we may hope that He will meet us.
   And, next, when He does meet us, we may expect that He will always have
   a good word for us.

   III. Thirdly, WHEN JESUS MEETS US, IT BEHOOVES US TO GET AS NEAR TO HIM
   AS WE CAN. "And they came and held Him by the feet."

   Note that they first stood still. They had been running quickly to
   carry the angel's message to the disciples, but at the sound of their
   Lord's voice they stopped, half out of breath, and they seemed to say
   by their looks, "It is, indeed, our blessed Master! It is the very same
   Lord whom we saw laid in the tomb, the Best-Beloved of our soul!" Then,
   next, they approached Him. They did not flee away backward at all, but
   they came right up to Him "and held Him by the feet." Now, dear
   Friends, if Jesus is near you, come still closer to Him! If you feel
   that He is passing by, come near to Him by an act of your will. Be all
   alive and wide-awake--do not be half asleep in your pew, but say, "If
   He is here, I will get to Him. If He is anywhere about, I will speak
   with Him and beg Him to speak to me." If ever our heart was active, it
   ought to be active in the Presence of Christ! And let us try to be all
   aglow with joy, for so were these women. They were delighted to behold
   their risen Lord, so they drew nearer to Him and, all intent with
   earnest, burning, all-conquering love, they came so close to Him that
   they could grasp Him, for they felt that they must adore Him.

   Now, Beloved, let it be so with you and with me. Do not let us lose a
   single word that our Lord is ready to speak to us. If this is the time
   of His appearing to us, let Him not come and find us asleep. If He is
   knocking at the door, if He is saying to us, "Open to Me, My Sister, My
   Love, My Dove, My Undefiled," let us not reply that we cannot leave the
   bed of sloth to let Him in--but now, more than ever, let us breathe a
   mighty prayer, "Come, O You Blessed One whose voice I know full well,
   and commune with me." If Jacob held the Angel whom he did not know--if,
   as our hymn puts it, he said--

   "Come, O You Traveler unknown, Whom still I hold, but cannot see! My
   company before is gone, And I am left alone with Thee"--

   let us much more say--

   "Come, O You Traveler well-known, Whom still I hold, but cannot see,

   I must have your company. My spirit craves it, sighs for it, pines for
   it! I must have You. I will hold You. Leave me not, but reveal Yourself
   to me now!"

   That is the third lesson we may learn from our text.

   IV. And the fourth I have almost touched upon. I could not help it. It
   is this, WHEN JESUS MEETS US, WE SHOULD RETAIN HIM AND WORSHIP HIM.
   "They came and held Him by the feet and worshipped Him."

   When Mary Magdalene first sought to hold her Lord, Jesus said to her,
   "Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father." But now He
   permits what He had formerly forbidden--"They came and held Him by the
   feet"--those blessed feet that the nails had held but three days
   before! He had risen from the grave and, therefore, a wondrous change
   had taken place in Him--but the wounds were there, still visible, and
   these women "held Him by the feet." And, Beloved, whenever you get your
   Lord Jesus near to you, do not let Him go for any little trifle--no,
   nor even for a great thing, but say, with the spouse in the Canticles,
   "I found Him whom my soul loves: I held Him, and would not let Him go."
   The saints, themselves, will sometimes drive Christ away from those who
   love Him. Therefore the spouse said, "I charge you, O you daughters of
   Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir
   not, nor awake my love, till He pleases." Be jealous lest you lose Him,
   when you have realized the joy, the rich delight, of having Him in your
   soul! You feel, at such a time as that, as if you scarcely dared to
   breathe--and you are so particular about your conduct that you would
   not venture to put one foot before the other without consulting Him,
   lest even inadvertently you should cause Him grief! Bow thus at His
   feet. Be humble. Hold Him by the feet. Be bold, be affectionate. Grasp
   Him, for though He is your God, He is also your Brother, bone of your
   bone and flesh of your flesh!

   But take care that in it all, you worship Him--"They came and held Him
   by the feet, and worshipped Him." This is not the Socinians'
   christ--they cannot worship their savior, for he is but a mere man.
   This is ourChrist, "the Son of the Highest," "very God of very God,"
   "God over all, blessed forever." As we hold Him by the feet, we feel a
   holy awe stealing over us, for the place where we stand is holy ground
   when He is there! We hold Him, but still we reverently bow before Him
   and feel like John in Patmos when He wrote, "When I saw Him, I fell at
   His feet as dead." Well spoke one of old, to whom it was said, "You
   cannot see Christ and live." "Then," replied the saint, "let me see Him
   and die." And we would say the same, for, whatever happens to us, we
   wish for a sight of Him! I have read of one who cried, under the
   overpowering weight of Divine manifestations, "Stop, Lord! Stop! I am
   but an earthen vessel and if You fill me fuller, I will perish." Had I
   been in his place, I think I would not have spoken quite as he did, but
   I would have said, "Go on, Lord, with the blessed manifestation of
   Yourself! Let the earthen vessel be broken if necessary--it cannot
   possibly come to a better end than by being crushed and even
   annihilated by the majesty of Your glorious Presence!" At any rate, we
   will hold Him and worship Him--may the Lord help us to do so more and
   more!

   V. The last remark I have to make is a practical one. It also comes out
   of our text. FROM SUCH A MEETING WITH CHRIST, WE SHOULD GO ON A FURTHER
   ERRAND FOR HIM. "Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid. Go tell My
   brethren to go into Galilee, and there will they see Me."

   When we have such a meeting with Christ as these women had, let us go
   on some further errand for Him as soon as He permits us to do so. It is
   a very blessed thing to have fellowship with Christ, but it would be a
   very ill result of our communion with Him if it led any one of us to
   say, "Now I shall not go back to my service. I shall not go to my class
   again. I might be provoked by the scholars. I might be careless and so
   I might lose the fellowship I am now enjoying with Jesus. I shall not
   go and preach again. I shall stay at home and have communion with
   Christ all day." I knew one Brother who got into such a condition that
   he really thought that to see the face of his people on the Lord's Day
   robbed Him of fellowship with Christ! All week long he never saw
   anybody, for his fellowship with Christ, he said, was so intense that
   he could not bear to look upon mankind! And when the Sabbath came and
   he had to meet with his people, he would, if he could, have preached
   out of a box so that they might hear his voice, but he might never see
   them. Now, I do not think that such a spirit as that is at all right!
   Who is the man who can best bear witness for Christ, but the man who
   has been with Him in secret and sacred fellowship? And what is a better
   return for Christ's wondrous Grace to us than that we should consecrate
   ourselves to the holy task of showing forth His Glory among our fellow
   men?

   There is a striking legend illustrating the blessedness of performing
   our duty at whatever cost to our own inclination. A monk had seen a
   beautiful vision of our Savior and, in silent bliss, He was gazing upon
   it. The hour arrived at which it was his duty to feed the poor at the
   convent gate. He would gladly have lingered in his cell to enjoy the
   vision, but under a sense of duty he tore himself away from it to
   perform his humble service. When he returned, he found the blessed
   vision still waiting for him, and heard a voice saying, "Had you
   stayed, I would have gone. As you have gone, I have remained." So, dear
   Friend, ask yourself, "Since Jesus is very precious to me, what more
   can I do for Him? I was running to His disciples when He met me, so
   when He bids me go to them, I will run the faster that no time may be
   lost to the disciples before they, also, share the enjoyment with which
   my Master has indulged me! And when I get to them, I shall have more to
   tell them than I had before. I was going to tell them that I had seen
   the angel of the Lord, but I shall be able to tell them that I have
   seen the Lord, Himself, and I shall tell the message so much more
   brightly and powerfully now that I have had it confirmed from His own
   lips."

   Those holy women were full of fear and joy--strangely mingled emotions,
   before--but now, surely fear must have taken flight, for Jesus had said
   to them, "Be not afraid." And it must have been joy, and joy, alone,
   with which these blessed women would break in upon the eleven and say,
   "We have seen what is far better than a vision of angels, for we have
   seen the Master Himself! We held Him by the feet till we knew that it
   was really our Lord! We held Him till we had worshipped Him and heard
   Him say, 'Be not afraid.' And then He gave us a message from His own
   dear lips, and this is what He said to us, 'Tell My brethren to go into
   Galilee, and there shall they see Me.'"

   Happy preacher who, on his way to his pulpit, is interrupted by meeting
   his Master! Happy preacher who has lost the thread of his discourse,
   for few discourses are worth much that have too much thread in them,
   but who has found something infinitely better than thread--some links
   of sacred fire--some chains of Heavenly love that go from end to end of
   the discourse, so that he tells what he knows, and testifies what he
   has seen, for men must give heed to such a witness! His countenance is
   all aglow with the light that shines from the face of Jesus! It is
   bright with the joy that fills the preacher's own soul! And those who
   listen to him say, "Would God we knew that joy!" And those that do
   share it say, "Yes, we know it," and they respond to it till hearts
   leap up to speak with hearts--and they sing together a chorus of praise
   unto Him whom they unitedly love! I wish it were so at this moment. I
   would like, dear Friends, to be able to tell my message better because
   of having met my Master. And I would like you to go out to the work and
   service of another week strengthened and rendered mighty and wise for
   all you have to do, because Jesus has met you and has said to you, "All
   hail," and you have held Him by the feet and worshipped Him!

   There I leave the subject with you. Perhaps some of you are saying, "We
   wish we could hold Him by the feet." Yes, but in this blessed supper,
   which is spread upon the table, you have an outward emblem of how to
   hold Him better than by the feet, for, in the eating of the bread and
   the drinking of the wine in memory of Him, He sets forth to us how His
   whole Self can be spiritually received into the innermost chambers of
   our being--how He can come unto us and sup with us, and we with
   Him--how He can dwell in us and we can dwell in Him. Not only the peace
   of God, but His very Self can now come and abide in your very self, and
   there can be a union between you and Him that never shall be broken!
   God grant that you may enjoy it even now!

   But I know that some here present cannot understand what I have been
   talking about. It must have seemed like an idle tale to them. Ah, dear
   Friends! And if we were to go into a stable and were to talk to horses
   about the ordinary concerns of our home life, what would they know
   about it all? They understand about oats, beans, hay and straw--but
   what can they know of the themes that interest intelligent human
   beings? So, there are some men in this world, of whom Dr. Watts truly
   says--

   "Like brutes they live, like brutes they die."

   They have no spiritual nature, even as the horse has no immortal soul,
   and they cannot, therefore, comprehend spiritual things! And as I might
   pity the horse because it is a stranger to mental enjoyments, so I
   would pity the unregenerate man who is a stranger to spiritual
   enjoyments. For, as much as the mind of man is above the living
   something that is within the brute, so much is the spirit of the
   Believer above the ordinary mind of the unregenerate man. We have joys,
   the sweetness of which is such that honey is not to be compared! We
   have bliss, the like of which all Solomon's wealth could not have
   purchased! And we have been introduced into a world which is as much
   fairer than this material universe as the sunlight is better than the
   darkest midnight of a dungeon!

   Oh, that you did all know it! May God, of His Grace, give you His
   Spirit, create you anew and breathe faith in Jesus into your soul! Then
   will you know the bliss of meeting with Him and of serving Him! God
   bless the Word, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS 3:11-26; ACTS 4:1-4; 2 PETER 3.

   You remember, dear Friends, how Peter denied his Lord in the time of
   His trial. Now notice what a change was worked in him after the Holy
   Spirit had fallen upon him on the day of Pentecost. We have often read
   the story of the man healed at the beautiful gate of the Temple. Now
   let us see what followed:

   Acts 3:11. And as the lame man, which was healed held Peter and John,
   all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called
   Solomon's, greatly wondering. I t is always easy to draw a crowd, but
   there was really something wonderful to be seen that day! The Apostle
   was careful to turn to the very best account the curiosity of the
   crowd. See how quickly he carried their thoughts away from the man
   before him to the greater Man, the Divine Man, the Son of God whom they
   had rejected.

   12-23. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of
   Israel, why marvel you at this? Or why look you so earnestly on us, as
   though by our own power or holiness we had made this man walk? The God
   of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has
   glorified His Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied Him in the
   presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. But you
   denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted
   unto you; and killed the Prince of Life, who God has raised from the
   dead; whereof we are witnesses. And His name through faith in His name
   has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which
   is by Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
   all And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did it, as
   didalso your rulers. But those things which God before hadshowed by the
   mouth of allHis Prophets, that Christ should suffer, He has so
   fulfilled. Repent you, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
   be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
   Presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was
   preached unto you: whom the Heaven must receive until the times of
   restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His
   holy Prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said to the
   fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
   brethren, like unto me; Him shall you hear in all things whatever He
   shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul which
   will not hear that Prophet, shallbe destroyed from among the people.
   Hear this, then, you who have heard Christ through His Word and through
   His servants, and have heard Him preach--yes, scores and hundreds of
   times! Let me read this text to you again and as I read it, may it sink
   into your hearts. "It shall come to pass, that every soul which will
   not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."

   24-26. Yes, and all the Prophets from Samuel and those that follow
   after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
   You are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God
   made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in your seed shall all
   the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you, first, God, having
   raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every
   one of you from his iniquities. They were to have the first
   proclamation of the Gospel. From among them would be gathered many of
   the first converts. The preacher did not know immediately what result
   this sermon produced. It was not like the sermon preached at Pentecost,
   for he did know what happened after its delivery. This is quite as good
   a sermon in every way and we have every reason to believe that many
   were converted by it. The Spirit of God was with Peter, yet even the
   Spirit of God does not always work in the same way upon men. You see,
   the Apostles had no opportunity to have a talk with the people
   afterwards, and to find out what had been done, as they had on the day
   of Pentecost.

   Acts 4:1-4. And as they spoke unto the people, the priests, and the
   captain of the Temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, being grieved
   that they taught the people, andpreached through Jesus the resurrection
   from the dead. And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody
   until the next day, for it was now eventide. Howbeit many of them which
   heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five
   thousand So that, though they could not tell then and there how many
   were converted, and though they could not baptize them at once, for
   they were taken away, yet, though there was no meeting, later, there
   were probably just as many saved as at Pentecost! Just as grand a
   result came of it! You cannot judge the result of a sermon on the
   particular day that it is preached--it may seem as if that sermon had
   produced no effect and it may be so--but, still, this time it was not
   so. Whenever you go home sad that you have not had a later meeting, or
   you are interrupted and cannot tell what good was done, though youdo
   not know what has been accomplished, the record is in Heaven and God
   will reveal it, by-and-by! And, perhaps, even here you will discover
   that you made a mistake and that the service which seemed lost was one
   of the most blessed that you ever conducted. God grant that it may be
   so, for Christ's sake! Now let as read Peter's second Epistle, the
   third chapter.

   2 Peter 3:1-3. This second epistle, Beloved, I now write unto you; in
   both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: that you
   may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy
   Prophets, and of the commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and
   Savior: knowing this first that there shall come in the last days
   scoffers, walking according to their own lusts. This prophecy is most
   certainly being fulfilled in these days.

   4. And saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the
   fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
   beginning of the creation. ' 'Inviolable laws still govern the material
   creation. Men are still swift to sin. Oppressors are not overthrown
   and, oftentimes, the good are left to languish in poverty and
   suffering. 'Where is the promise of His coming?'"

   5. For this they willingly are ignorant I gnorant that there has been
   one great interposition of God to avenge the insults to His holy Law
   and to overturn the rule of sin. "For this they willingly are
   ignorant."

   5, 6. That by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth
   standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then
   was, being overflowed with water, perished. God did destroy man, once,
   with water, and sweep away sin.

   7. But the Heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same Word are
   kept in store, reserved unto fire against the Day of Judgment and
   perdition of ungodly men. There will come a second interposition--we
   know not when, but assuredly it shall come! And if the visitation
   tarries, we must wait for it, for it shall come--it will not really
   tarry, however long it may seem to be delayed.

   8. But, Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
   with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
   There are no years to Him! There are no days to the great Ancient of
   Days. A thousand years must seem to be a mere speck in comparison with
   His everlasting existence--as a dream when one awakes, it has swiftly
   passed away. But God still remains!

   9. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count
   slackness; but is long-suffering to us, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance. Therefore does He wait.
   If men ask why there is no interposition of wrath to overthrow the
   ungodly, the answer is because this is part of God's great reign of
   love. He waits because He is "not willing that any should perish, but
   that all should come to repentance." Yet there will be a limit even to
   His patience.

   10. But the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which
   the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
   melt with fervent heat, the earth, also, and the works that are therein
   shall be burned up. The next and great judgment will be by fire.

   11. 12. Seeing, then, that all these things shall be dissolved, what
   manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and
   godliness, looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God,
   wherein the Heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
   shall melt with fervent heat?This should be the practical outcome of
   the anticipation of coming judgment. Let us look on "all these things"
   as passing away.

   13. Nevertheless we, according to Hispromise, look for new Heavens anda
   new earth, wherein dweels righteousness. The end of this world will be
   the beginning of a new and better one, of which "righteousness" will be
   the great characteristic!

   14. Therefore, Beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be
   diligent that you may be found by Him in peace, without spot and
   blameless. There is, again, the practical note.

   15. 16. Andaccount that the long-suffering ofourLordis salvation; even
   as our beloved brother Paul, also, according to the wisdom given unto
   him, has written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in
   them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood to
   them that are unlearned and unstable, wrest, as they do also the other
   Scriptures, unto their own destruction. The Scriptures are given for
   our learning and, rightly used, guide us to the Savior. But, alas, some
   "wrest" them "unto their own destruction." Let none of us ever be found
   committing such fatal folly as that.

   17, 18. You therefore, Beloved, seeing you know these things before,
   beware lest you, also, being led away with the error of the wicked,
   fall from your own steadfastness. But grow in Grace, and in the
   knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now
   and forever. Amen. I should like to point out to young Christians and
   to all Christian people how Peter finishes this Epistle, first with a
   warning and then with a counsel. He says, "Beware lest you be led
   away." And then he puts in a, "but"--"but grow in Grace." If you go
   into a plantation at a certain time of the year, you may see a great
   number of trees that have no leaves on them. How are you to know which
   are alive and which are not? Well, you would soon know if you could
   look at their roots. If a tree has been growing, if its roots have
   taken hold upon the soil, you may pull it, but you will not stir it.
   There it stands and, in like manner, growth in Grace brings
   steadfastness in Grace. You who have faith, pray God that you may have
   growingfaith. A living faith is a growing faith, and a growing faith is
   a living faith! Pray, therefore, that you may "grow in Grace."

God's Work in Man

   (No. 2629)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 2, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING, IN THE
   SUMMER OF 1857.

   "And it shall be in that day, says the LORRD, that you shall call Me,
   Ishi; and shall call Me no more, Baali. For I will take away the names
   of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by
   their name." Hosea 2:16.

   WITHOUT any preface or prelude, we shall draw from these words three on
   four lessons.

   I. The first lesson from the text is this, that GOD SPEAKS CONCERNING
   HIS PURPOSES OF GRACE IN MAN WITHOUT NOTICING EITHER MAN'S WILLINGNESS
   OR UNWILLINGNESS--AND WITHOUT ALLOWING HIS OWN PURPOSE TO BE CHANGED BY
   THE ONE OR THE OTHER.

   According to the free-will plan of salvation, it would be absolutely
   necessary for God to put it thus--"At that day, says the Lord, if you
   are willing, you shall call Me, Ishi, and shall no longer call Me,
   Baali. And if you will believe and repent, if you are willing, I will
   take away the names of Baalim out of your mouth. And if you are
   willing, they shall no more be remembered by their names." But note
   that God puts in no, "ifs," at all, but talks about men as if they had
   absolutely nothing to do in the matter--and as if He, Himself, did it
   all! One might object, "But suppose they are unwilling to forget the
   names of Baalim?" "Ah," says God, "but I have their will in My hands! I
   have the key of man's will--I can open it and no man can shut it. I can
   shut it and no man can open it." "But suppose they should be
   hard-hearted and will not repent?" "Yes," says the Lord, "but I have
   the hammer that can break the heart in pieces and make it fly into
   shivers!" "But suppose they should be stony-hearted and will not melt?"
   "No," says the Lord, "but I have a fire that will melt the most
   adamantine rock that was ever known. Yes, that can consume the rock out
   of the heart and utterly burn it away." Therefore, speaking concerning
   the Israelites, who were serving Baalim, who were drunk with sin, who
   were desperately set on worldling iniquity and who had gone far away
   from God, He puts in no, "if," but distinctly says even concerning
   them, "I will take away the names of Baalim out of their mouth, and
   they shall no more be remembered by their name"

   Have you ever noticed, throughout Scripture, how positively God speaks
   with regard to His acts of salvation in men? "He shallcall upon Me, and
   I willanswer him." "All that the Father gives Me shallcome to Me." "Him
   that came to me I willin no wise cast out." "He shallsee of the travail
   of His soul and shallbe satisfied." The free-willer might rise up and
   say, "But suppose they are not willing to be saved? Will God save them
   against their will?" To this we reply-- There is nothing said about
   their willat all--the only reference is to God's will! It is evident
   that God has such a power over men that He can work in their hearts
   just what He pleases, apart from their willingness or unwillingness, so
   that, when I come into this pulpit to preach, if God the Spirit should
   so please, though you all should gnash your teeth in anger, yet He
   could, under the sound of the Word, convert you all. Though you should
   set your hearts desperately against God's Word and enter His House with
   a curse upon you, yet He could, before you left the place, change you
   to another mind!

   And though you should have come here with all levity of spirit,
   hardened in heart, despising God and His Gospel, yet He has such
   strength that He could, by one word of His mouth, by the breath of His
   Spirit, transform you into His living children who should do the very
   reverse of what you are now doing! It is in vain, then, for an infidel
   to say that he could never be converted, for God could convert him. It
   is in vain for a man to say, "God will never bend my knees in prayer."
   God knows how to make your knees bend, be they ever so stiff. "I never
   will, like a coward, cry for mercy," says one. But God knows how to
   create penitent cries in your heart and how to make them struggle for
   utterance, too! He has you in His hand, He has the bit even in your
   mouth. And desperately as you may be set against Him, yet He can turn
   you wherever He pleases. He who binds Leviathan and cuts the dragon in
   two will not be stopped by a poor puny mortal like you! But if He has
   purposes of Grace towards you, He will work those purposes out. If He
   is determined to save you, He will, Himself, lure you into the
   wilderness and give you a new heart and a right spirit! And if He has
   so decreed it, struggle as you may against Him, the hour shall come
   when, with one blow from the hammer of His Word, your heart shall be
   broken in pieces! And with one sip of His blessed cordial of Grace,
   your soul shall rejoice in pardon bought with blood!

   This is a great Doctrine of the Gospel--the Doctrine of the power of
   Grace--the Doctrine that God saves whom He wills, that "it is not of
   him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy."
   "Ah," says one, "if I am willing to be saved, will not God save me?"
   Sir, He has saved you! If you are willing to be saved, God has made you
   willing, and therein He has given you the very germ of salvation, for
   your willingnessto be saved in God's way is the very essence of being
   saved! "But," says one, "if I am unwilling to be saved, will He save
   me?" No, Sir, not while you are unwilling, but, if He so pleases, He
   will make you willing and then He will manifest in you His power to
   save! God saves no man against his will--and yet it is against his
   will. Ralph Erskine puts it thus--he says, "I was saved with full
   consent against my will." He means to say, "against my oldwill, that
   always willed to do evil, but yet, with the full consent of all my
   powers, they being renewed, created anew in Christ Jesus and,
   therefore, at once willing to submit to everything that God laid down."

   Oh, how I rejoice to preach a Gospel that does not borrow strength from
   me, but gets its power from God! What a consolation that, go where we
   may to preach God's Word, if God wills it, that Word shall be rendered
   effectual among the very worst of men--among mockers, scoffers and
   despisers! Why is it that men go not to preach the Word among the
   Romanists of Ireland? Because they say they will not hear them. Oh, but
   they would! And we should at least free ourselves from their blood if
   we did but stand up and testify the Word of God! However unwilling they
   might be, God could yet, by His abundant Grace, change their hearts!
   "It is of no use," said one, "to go to the Bechuana in his kraal--he
   cannot be saved--he would never be willing to give up his old habits."
   But you do not depend upon hswill at all! You go to him with the Gospel
   and God gives him a new will and the great change is worked! All you
   have to do is to preach the Word! "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing
   by the Word of God," for, with the Word of God, there goes forth His
   Holy Spirit which changes men, renews their characters and hearts and
   makes them what they never were before. Oh, I bless God's name that,
   though all the people in the world should lift their hands against the
   Most High and declare that they never would be saved, yet God could, in
   an instant, if so it pleased Him, make the whole of them bend their
   knees before Him, cry for the mercy they once rejected and seek the
   Savior whom they once despised! Here lies the power of the Gospel, in
   that it gains the mastery over man's evil will and without his consent
   changes his nature, and then fully gets his consent after his nature
   has been changed!

   That is the first Doctrine of God, I think, we may fairly draw from the
   text.

   II. Now for the second, which is, that GOD WILL MAKE THOROUGH WORK OF
   IT WHEN HE SANCTIFIES A

   MAN.

   Note that these Jews were idolaters, yet God says, "I will not only
   make them leave off their idolatries, but I will do more--I will take
   away the names of Baalim out of their memories--for they shall no more
   be remembered by their name." God's sanctifying work either is already,
   or it will yet be a complete one. I said that it either is or it will
   be complete--it is so in yon bright spirits before the Throne of God
   and, for the rest of us, if God has begun the good work, He will carry
   it on to ultimate perfection until the very name of sin shall be clean
   taken out of our mouth and the remembrance of it shall be purged from
   our conscience and memory!

   It is worthy of remark that this promise has had a literal fulfillment
   in the case of the Jews. They have many sins, but there is one sin that
   they have not--except spiritually--that is, they are not idolaters!
   Before the time of their captivity, they were constantly worshipping
   one false God or another. It was the hardest thing in the world to keep
   them from bowing down before blocks of wood and stone. But now, go
   where you may, you can scarcely find a Jew who is an idolater. Here and
   there, one or two of them have joined the Romish church and so have
   become idolaters by bowing down before images and saints' relics--cast
   clouts and rotten bones and such things. But, taking the Jews as a
   race, they are the last people in the world to become actual idolaters!
   That ancient message, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord,"
   seems to have been burnt into them and you cannot get it out of
   them--neither will they acknowledge any form of faith that seems to
   deny the unity of the Godhead, or implies that worship is to be given
   to any save the incomprehensible and mysterious Being whom they, as
   well as we, worship as Jehovah. The name of Baalim has been taken clean
   out of their mouths--they do not remember it, neither do they call it
   to mind!

   And it is also a very notable thing, which we have often seen, that
   men, when they are converted, usually become the most clear of the very
   sin with which they were once the most defiled. You will note that a
   man who has been, before his conversion, a great drunk, will, in some
   instances, not only become exceedingly sober afterwards, but he will
   even carry his views, if possible, to an extreme. He will be so
   desperately set against everything that once injured him, that he will
   even look with suspicion on others who indulge themselves in
   moderation. You will note it is so with the man who has been an
   habitual Sabbath-breaker. So surely as he is converted, he will become
   the most precise Sabbath-keeper you ever knew! The sin that hurt him
   will be the sin that he will kill, if possible. The burnt child dreads
   the fire and it is the same with the man who has been burnt by sin. He
   does not like to touch it again. He must keep clean away from it, turn
   from it, pass by it and utterly abhor it. So was it with the Jews--the
   worship of Baalim had been their favorite sin, so the name, Baalim, was
   to be taken out of their mouth and to be no more called to their
   remembrance.

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, what noble beings you and I will be when
   not only has our sin been purged, when not only have our daily
   corruptions been done away with, but when all our sinful nature has
   been utterly removed! Well said the Apostle, "It does not yet appear
   what we shall be." No, Brethren, we can scarcely guess what we shall
   be! But we can for a moment contemplate it. What a noble being man must
   be when he is thoroughly refined--when all his sin is gone--when there
   is not an evil passion left--when there is not a lust hidden in a snug
   corner, but when his soul has become thoroughly pure and his heart
   entirely renewed! Oh, what a noble creature! And just remember this,
   poor, weak, and worthless though we are, that faith which we have in us
   will ultimately purify us and we shall be holy, like yon bright spirits
   before the Throne of God!

   What a grand man would he be who had no sin in him! Suppose him to come
   into this world? He would lead a life exactly like that led by our
   Lord, Jesus Christ, and He was the grandest of all men! It is marvelous
   to consider the different attributes of His Character, as they are
   manifested in His life, but remember that we, too, shall be like He
   when we see Him as He is. We shall be as pure as Adam was in the
   Garden, with this addition--that our purity shall be not merely
   spotless, but it shall be so white that it shall be beyond the
   possibility of ever being spotted! Our nature shall be not merely pure,
   but so pure that it can never be impure! God will stamp it so indelibly
   with the stamp of purity that it will be pure throughout eternity! Oh,
   what a blessed thought--the name of Baalim out of my mouth, sin out of
   my heart, the lustful glance forever gone from my eyes, evil things
   from my imagination all gone! Oh, will we not praise our Lord in the
   bright moment when we wake up in His likeness, when our glorified
   spirit shall be white as driven snow in the glad companionship of the
   Immaculate, the Pure, the Perfect? Oh, what joyous shouts we shall
   raise then! What choral symphonies, what bursts of song, what
   hallelujahs of gratitude! Verily, words fail to express the emotions we
   shall then feel, when, pure and holy, clean and purged, we shall be
   presented, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing," before the
   Throne of God!

   "I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall
   no more be remembered by their name." I think the first day in Heaven
   will be a day full of surprises. We shall not know what to make of it!
   Never will there have been a day before, in our lives, when we had not
   some trouble, or some sin. The first day we are there, when we shall
   have no devil to tempt us, and no sin to pain us, and no trouble to
   grieve us--when we find ourselves all pure, I think we shall scarcely
   know what to do, we shall be so surprised! Mr. Medley's hymn has caught
   the right idea--

   "Then let me mount and soar away

   To the bright world of endless day

   And sing with rapture and surprise,

   His loving kindness in the skies!" We shall be almost like poor Caspar
   Hauser who was kept for many years--in fact, from his childhood--in a
   dark dungeon where a ray of light could scarcely enter. He was,
   afterwards, taken out by his keeper to see the light of the sun and to
   mingle among men, whom he had never seen before, and to hear their
   voices even though there was scarcely an intelligible sound he had been
   taught to utter. Oh, what a delightful thing it would have been for him
   if he had been uninjured by his confinement! But you and I, uninjured
   by our confinement in this cavern below, shall be at once snatched from
   the earth, set down in the streets of Paradise and find ourselves pure!
   The surprise of a beggar, who wakes up and finds himself a king would
   not be one-half so great as the surprise of a saint, when he shall wake
   up in Christ's likeness and find himself transformed into the pure
   image of God! Let us contemplate this with joy and gladness and, amid
   all our daily conflicts, let us count upon the victory! Let us
   anticipate the conquest by faith and let us already seize the palm
   branch and put the crown upon our heads with the ecstasy of hope and
   with the full assurance of faith, for if we fight, we shall reign! If
   we suffer, we shall triumph! If we endure, we shall obtain "the crown
   of life" that fades not away!

   That is the second lesson of our text, that Christ will make thorough
   work of it, wherever He has begun to save and to sanctify.

   III. And now I bring to you a third lesson. THERE ARE SOME THINGS,
   WHICH ARE NOT EVIL IN THEMSELVES, THAT A CHRISTIAN MUST HAVE NOTHING TO
   DO WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH EVIL THINGS.

   I will explain what the Lord meant when He said, "You shall call Me,
   Ishi; and shall call Me no more, Baali." Was Baali a bad name? Not at
   all--God calls Himself Baali in two or three places in Scripture. You
   remember that blessed passage, "Your Maker is your Husband"? It is
   really, "Your Maker is your Baali." And there are several other
   instances where the word, Husband, is used in reference to God which
   might have been left untranslated--and they would have read like this,
   "Your Maker is your Baali." Why, then, is God not to be called, Baali?
   The Jews did, at one time, call Him so. They prayed to Him under that
   title--why might they not continue to do so? Because the heathen had
   made a wrong use of the word--they called their false God, Baali, and,
   therefore, God said, "Do not apply the title to Me, because they have
   used it for their false gods." I can suppose a Jew, like some young man
   in these times, saying, "Now, no man is going to step between me and my
   conscience. I believe the name Baali is a very good one. I have always
   used it and many good men have used it. I use it very sincerely in
   prayer and it is nothing to me that other people make a bad use of
   it--I cannot help that! I know that it expresses my thought--it means
   husband, lordly husband--and I cannot be quite so particular as the
   Prophet Hosea, so I shall keep on using it."

   That is how many argue in these days. Says one, "I am a Christian. I
   intend to serve God, but there are certain pleasures that stand on the
   boundary line between the allowable and the unallowable." "I intend,"
   says one young man, "to follow them, because I do not see that there is
   any harm in them. I confess that they are the cause of great injury to
   others, but they do meno hurt. I used to practice them when I was in
   the world, but they are no hurt to me now--you cannot bring anything in
   Scripture to prove they are wrong. There is such-and-such a place, I
   sometimes truly worship God there. I may be mistaken, but I cannot see
   why I should not do such-and-such a thing when I see nothing exactly
   wrong in it, though I admit that it has a connection with wrong and
   others are thereby injured." That is just it--you are not to use the
   title, Baali, not because it is a bad name, but because others have
   used it for an evil purpose! So, Christian, there are many things you
   are not to do, and many places you are not to frequent--not because
   they are absolutely wrong, but because they have a connection with
   wrong--and if you tolerate them, you will be sharing in the sin which
   is committed by them! And, moreover, whether you know it or not, your
   going there is but the little and little of which it is written, "You
   shall fall by little and by little." So that the best way is to stand
   out against the littles--to be rather too strict than too loose--and in
   so doing, God will give you a reward, for He will make it become a
   greater happiness to you to abstain from fleshly pleasures than it
   would have been to have partaken of them. "You shall call Me no more,
   Baali," because, though the name may be all right in itself, others
   have misused it.

   I can never look upon dice except with abhorrence. If you ask me why, I
   reply--Because the soldiers at the foot of the Cross threw dice for my
   Savior's garments, and I have never heard the rattling of dice but I
   have conjured up the dreadful scene of Christ upon His Cross--and
   gamblers at the foot of it with their dice spattered with His blood! I
   do not hesitate to say that, of all sins, there is none that more
   surely damns men and, worse than that, makes them the devil's helpers
   to damn others, than gambling! And yet many say, "Well, I only play for
   the fun of it--you know there is nothing in it." Of course there is
   nothing in it, but look at the connection of it. Lord So-and-So thinks
   it a very nice thing for him to go and see a horserace, he says that I
   cannot prove it to be wrong. Nice company he will meet there! They
   don't speak very well for the thing.

   Another says, "I can do this, that, and the other. It does not hurt
   me." I daresay you can, but look at the connection of the affair. You
   are to avoid a thing, not merely from the moral wrong of it, or the
   injury it is to you, but because it encourages others in their sins! A
   good pious Jew kneels down to pray and cries to God, "Baali, hear me!"
   There is a poor idolater by his side and he says, "That good,
   venerable-looking man just now prayed to Baali--and so may I." "Quite a
   mistake, my dear fellow," says the Jew. "I did not pray to Baali! I was
   praying to God Almighty, not to your Baal." "But you said, Baal, my
   dear Sir." "Ah, my Friend, but you do not understand me! I was praying
   to the God of Heaven and earth, and not to that poor, paltry idol which
   you call, Baal." Yet the poor heathen naturally thought the Jew was
   worshipping the false god.

   We are to take care not to do what appears wrong in the sight of
   others, so as to lead them astray. We are not to be judged by other
   men's consciences, but, at the same time, we are not to lead others to
   offend. As far as we can possibly do it, we must seek to cut off those
   things that are likely to do injury to others. If I were to hear of any
   of my members going to a theater, I think I would go after them, and
   they would never go, again, as church members. I might, perhaps, do as
   Rowland Hill did. He took a box-ticket for the theater and saw some of
   his members there. "There you are," he said, "I never would believe it
   from hearsay." And then he walked away and immediately turned them out
   of the church. It may be that I may have the misery of looking after
   some of you who make a profession of religion and do not carry it out.
   I am not now speaking to you worldly men who choose to frequent these
   places. But I say to you who profess to be Christ's followers, "Put
   away even the name of such things. Your business is not to talk of its
   being allowable, but to put it away because others make a bad use of
   it." You may say, "Baal," perhaps, without any very great sin, but by
   doing so you encourage others in sin.

   A man who makes a profession of religion ought to be something more
   than other people. He who talks about being saved by Grace and washed
   in the precious blood of Jesus. He who expects to live up yonder and
   wear the white robe, and sing the praise of the Eternal before the
   Throne of God must be different from others. The things which another
   might do with impunity, he must not dare do. A native of India might
   live in a jungle and not die, but we, who are not natives of the
   country, might very soon die of the jungle fever. So, the man who is
   not a Christian may, perhaps, go into many amusements and yet not
   become any the worse for them--but a Christian must not go there
   because he is not an inhabitant of that land! It is not his native air,
   it is not his proper place and he knows it is not! Therefore, his
   business is to go as far away from it as he can!

   I have read of a lady who wanted a coachman. She advertised for one.
   Three presented themselves. She called them in, one by one, and she
   said to the first, "My good man, you want a coachman's place, do you?"
   "Yes, ma'm." "Well, there is one question I want to ask you--How near
   to danger could you drive me?" "Well, ma'm, I think I could drive
   within a yard." "You won't do for me," said she. A second one was
   brought in and she said to him, after asking other questions, "How near
   to danger could you drive?" "Well ma'm, for the matter of that, I could
   drive you within a hair's breadth." "You won't do for me," she said,
   "you are not the sort of driver I want." The third was introduced. He
   was a careful soul and when the question was put to him, "How near
   could you drive to danger?" He said, "If you please, ma'm, I never
   tried that. I always drive as far off as ever I can." Said she, "You
   will do very well. You are just the coachman I want." I would recommend
   you all to imitate that coachman! Do not test how near you can drive to
   danger, but say, "My business is to drive as far off as I can." Do not
   to see how much you can endure of that which is not right, but how much
   you can avoid it, pass it by and not mingle with it!

   IV. Now we come to the last lesson from the text. GOD HAS PRECIOUS
   TITLES TO BE USED ONLY BY BELIEVERS. "It shall be at that day, says the
   Lord, that you shall call Me, Ishi; and shall call Me no more, Baali."

   I left this part of the subject to the last because I am not sure that
   what I am about to say has all the weight that some would attach to it.
   There is a difference between the words, Ishi, and, Baali. The word,
   Ishi, means, "my husband." So does the word, Baali, but the word, Ishi,
   is the word that the wife would use to the husband as a fondling
   expression, expressive of her love. The word, Baali, is the word she
   uses for him as a humble expression, on those very rare occasions in
   which she feels herself to be subject to him for a moment. It is
   expressive of her humility. It is the kind of word Sarah used, when,
   rather out of the ordinary way, she did reverence to her husband,
   "calling him, lord." The word, Ishi, is the term she would have used
   when she called him simply by the loving epithet of "my own dear
   husband," her man, her Beloved. She would most likely have used the
   word, Baali, when her husband had spoken a little sharply to her and
   claimed a little of the headship that the husband has. But when they
   sat down together, in their softer moments, she would not call him,
   Baali, any longer, but it would be, Ishi, my much-loved--not feared,
   but much-lovedhusband.

   "Now," says God to His Church, "you shall no more call Me, Baali--'my
   Master, my Lord, my haughty Husband,' yet, after all, having all the
   right attributes of a husband, too, but you shall call Me, Ishi--'my
   loving Husband.'" Mark, there is nothing wrong in the word, Baali, as I
   said before, because it is applied to God in that very passage, "Your
   Maker is your Husband." And there it has a kind meaning, as well as the
   aspect of superiority, but, still, the word, Ishi, is the fonder title
   of the two and is, by far, the better. It is the one which we would
   always wish to use towards God. If we are His people, He does not like
   us to come crouching and cringing before Him. He does not wish us to
   come and cry, "Baali," but He wants us to come to Him as to a loving
   Friend and Father, with the sweet word, "Ishi," upon our lips. He
   wishes us to come, speaking of Christ as Emmanuel Ishi--"God With
   Us"--not as Emmanuel Baali--"God Our Ruler." He wishes us to speak of
   Him as "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh"--"our Man, our
   Husband"--and not as, "our Man, our Lord."

   There is a very blessed distinction here. I think the Christian can
   perceive it, though the worldling cannot. When a sinner is in his sin,
   he sometimes attempts to serve God. Conviction of sin works in him some
   kind of legal repentance-- he tries to be better, but the sinner always
   tries to be better with Baali on his lips--"O Lord, I must do right,
   else I shall be punished for it. I must mend my ways, or Hell stares me
   in the face. I must grow better, or else I shall die and share eternal
   torment." So he tries to do better through fear. Not so the Christian!
   He tries to serve his God, but he puts the name, Baali, away. "O my
   blessed God!" he says, "You have done so much for me, I do truly love
   You. I must love You, I will serve You, I will live for You, I will die
   for You. It is a pleasure to serve You. If Heaven were quenched and
   Hell blotted out, I would still serve You, for You are my Ishi, my
   Loved One, whom with all my heart I serve."

   But it is not so with the sinner when he first seeks mercy. He kneels
   down and prays to God to have mercy upon him, but all the while it is
   Baali to whom he speaks. He can never say, Ishi, while he is under
   conviction of sin. His cry is, "O Lord, I am the chief of sinners!" "I
   am not worthy to be called Your son." That is all Baali! But as soon as
   the Lord has appeared to him and told him, "I have put away your sin,"
   he offers no such prayer as he did before! He comes with boldness and
   says, "Lord, I am Your child! For Jesus' sake give me these things,"
   and he prays out of his heart with a fullness of confidence, for it is
   now, Ishi, not Baali! It was the same God before, but under a different
   aspect. He was a kind God before, but He was the Baali God. Now He is a
   kind God, but He is kinder--He is the Ishi God to all Believers.

   O Beloved Brothers and Sisters, I would you could all keep this word,
   Ishi, on your lips! It is a Hebrew word. I bless God for having kept a
   few Hebrew words in the Bible to make us remember the Jews. But,
   besides this, there is something very sweet in this old term, Ishi--my
   man, my Husband! Go home, Beloved, sit down and think of this title.
   God bids you come to Him boldly tonight and call Him, Ishi. Sit down
   and begin to think of the Son of God, who became Man. When you see Him
   in His cradle, call Him, Ishi, and fondle the Infant to your breast.
   When you see Him a grown Man, go up to Him and, by faith, clasp Him in
   your arms and call Him, Ishi, while He preaches to you the Sermon on
   the Mount. Find Him in the Garden. Stand and look at Him, not as some
   marvelous Man, far above you, your superior, a Baali to you--but come
   and kneel by His side and as you kneel, see, in contemplation, the
   bloody sweat still streaming from His brow. Bend over Him and say, "O,
   Ishi, You are my Man, my Husband, paying the costly price for me by
   this awful sweat of blood!"

   Then follow Him along the pavement. See His back all gory with the lash
   of Pilate's whip and call Him, Ishi, then. And when you see Him on the
   Cross, oh, it is there that Ishi is spelt more clearly than ever! When
   His heart is opened, when His veins are bleeding, then you can see
   written in His blood that name, Ishi--Man With You, your Husband. And
   then see Him in His grave and call Him, Ishi, there. Track Him up to
   Heaven in His Ascension and call Him, Ishi, as He leads captivity
   captive. See Him pleading before the Throne of God with outstretched
   hands. Look on His breastplate, read your own name and call Him, Ishi!
   And then look forward--see Him as He comes in the clouds of Heaven--and
   call Him, Ishi, then. See Him when He and all His people shall be
   gathered home to Glory. He shall be your Ishi, then--not your Baali,
   your Lord, your superior--but your Ishi, your Man, your Husband--to be
   embraced and loved, to be in sweet communion with you, to be your
   Acquaintance, your Friend, your "Fellow," as His Father and yours has
   been blessedly pleased to call Him!

   And, Christian, when you go forth to labor, tomorrow, take care not to
   do it as a slave. Practice this, "Ishi," out every day. Do not serve
   God because you dare not do other than serve Him! Do not serve Him
   because you are afraid not to serve Him! Do not do it from fear. Do not
   work like a slave, under his master's lash, but go out and serve your
   Master from pure delight because He is also your Ishi, your Man, your
   Husband--

   "We would no longer lie,

   Like slaves beneath the throne,

   Our faith would 'Ishi, Jesus,' cry,

   And You the kindred own." Go forth to your work, serving your Lord in
   love and joy and gladness--

   "'Tis love that makes our willing feet

   In swift obedience move."

   And now, in conclusion, my Friends, there are many here who cannot say,
   Ishi, for Christ is not Ishi to them! Baali is the only word they can
   use for God. What shall we do for them, dear Friends, those who know
   the Lord here? What shall we do for these? We have a little
   Sister--what shall we do for her, against the day that she shall be
   spoken for unto the King? If she is a wall, we will build upon her with
   many prayers, precious as silver! If she is a door, we will enclose her
   with the cedar of our supplication! We will, day and night, pray for
   these poor souls who are not yet brought in, but many of whom must be
   brought in, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd! Poor Sinner, I
   will preach the Gospel to you before I send you away. Are you trembling
   and shivering, crouching and cowering before God? Are you afraid of
   Him? Do you think His sword is out of its scabbard, hunting after you?
   Do you see the arrow of vengeance thirsty for blood and winged to slay?
   Do you see the Law of God after you? Then you have got as far as Baali!
   Ah, Soul, if you know what sin is, in all its blackness, and if you
   weep on account of it, and if you desire to be pardoned, if you are
   willing to abjure all sin and all self-righteousness, here is the way
   of salvation!

   Ishi bids me tell it to you, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you
   shall be saved." "Let me go, Sir! Let me go home and pray." No, Sir!
   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ! "Let me go out of this chapel and I
   will run home, and read a chapter." No, Sir! As you are standing there,
   if you know your need of a Savior, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved! Look at the jailor. He had made the feet of Paul
   and Silas fast in the stocks and shut them in the inner prison, like a
   brute as he was. But when there came the earthquake that shook the
   prison, he said, "What must I do to be saved?" "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved," said Paul! He did believe and
   became a child of God! And he was baptized directly afterwards, walking
   in the fear of Jesus. I believe conversion is very often gradual, but
   there is no reason why it should be so. If God has put you, now, in
   such a condition that you know yourself to be lost and ruined, you have
   every reason to believe that Christ died for you and to cast yourself
   upon Him, just as you are, without one plea but that Jesus died for
   you!

   Are you under conviction of sin? Do you feel that God would be just if
   He were to destroy you? Do you ask, "Can it be possible that all my
   sins could be blotted out in a moment?" Possible, Sir? It is certain
   that they may be! It is certain that they wilbe! It is certain that
   they ARE if you now believe in Christ!

   A lady called upon me, last Monday, with this trouble upon her. She
   said she had not heard me preach, but she had been reading my sermons
   and God had been pleased to bless them to her--not only to her
   conviction, but to her conversion. She went to the clergyman of the
   parish, full of joy at having found the Savior. She began to tell him
   of her gladness and how she rejoiced that all her sins were blotted
   out. He stopped her, and said, "My good Woman, that is all a delusion!
   You have no right to believe that your sins are pardoned till you have
   led several years of piety and devotion!" She went away sad--and she
   came to ask me if what the clergyman said was true. And when I quoted
   that verse--

   "The moment a sinner believes, And trusts in His crucified Good, His
   pardon at once he receives, Redemption in full through His blood!"
   "Oh," she said, "I see it clearly now!" And when I went on to tell her
   that many who had believed in Christ had been black sinners one moment,
   and white as snow the next--had cast themselves simply on Christ and
   had instantly found peace--she could not but take to her heart the
   precious promises of Christ and, believing in Jesus, being justified by
   faith, she had the peace of God that passes all understanding!

   I pray the Lord may give it to you right now! As many of you as shall
   now look to Christ. As many of you as shall lift up your hearts to Him.
   As many of you as God has ordained to eternal life and who, therefore,
   believe in Him, may you now go out of this house, like the publican of
   old, "justified rather than the other," triumphing that you, who came
   in here to confess your guilt, crying, "Lord, have mercy on me a
   sinner," can go out calling Jesus, Ishi, and clasping Him in your arms
   as your Redeemer, your Savior and your All-in-All!

   May the Lord give all of you such faith, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

What Jesus Would Do

   (No. 2630)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 9, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   16, 1882.

   "How often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen
   gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!" Matthew
   23:37.

   THE theologians have met each other around this text as on a field of
   battle. They have contended, controverted and dragged the text about as
   if it were a wild beast which they would tear limb from limb. And yet,
   if you will look through the letter of it, and come to its inner
   spirit, you will see that it is not strange that Jesus should have
   uttered it. It would have been much more marvelous if he had not spoken
   thus, and it would have been a terrible crux in all theology if we had
   read here, "I never would have gathered your children together even if
   they had been willing to be gathered." That would have been a thing
   hard to be understood, indeed! And it would have presented a greater
   difficulty than any which can be found in our text.

   I have long been content to take God's Word just as I find it and when,
   at any time, I have been accused of contradicting myself through
   keeping to my text, I have always felt perfectly safe about that
   matter. The last thing I care about is being consistent with myself!
   Why should I be anxious about that? I would rather be consistent with
   Christ 50 times over, or be consistent with the Word of God! But as to
   being forever consistent with oneself, it might turn out that one was
   consistently wrong, consistently narrow-minded and consistently
   unwilling to believe what God would teach. So we will take the text
   just as we find it and it seems to say to me that if Jerusalem was not
   saved--if her children were not gathered together in safety as a brood
   of chickens is gathered beneath the hen--if Christ did not gather them
   and protect them, it was not because there was any unwillingness on His
   part. There was always a willingness in His heart to bless Jerusalem
   and, therefore, He could truly say, "How often would I have gathered
   your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her
   wings!" From this utterance of our Lord, I learn that if any man is not
   saved, the cause of his non-salvation does not lie in any lack of
   graciousness or want of willingness on the part of God! They who dare
   to say that it does, venture very far, and are very audacious in their
   assertions. This text says the very opposite--and so far as it is
   applicable to the sons of men in general, it declares that God wills
   not the death of any, but desires that they should turn unto Him and
   live.

   The next Truth of God that I learn from this passage is that if
   Jerusalem perished--as it didperish in a most awful manner--it was
   because it would not be saved. It was often invited, persuaded,
   exhorted, warned and threatened. Prophet succeeded Prophet. Tribulation
   followed tribulation. The rod of God came as well as the Word of God,
   but Jerusalem was exceedingly wicked and its people were
   stiff-necked--they would not have the blessing with which prophetic
   hands dripped! And even when Christ, Himself, came, the loveliest and
   the lowliest, the most tender and the truest, bringing to them love and
   mercy without stint--and when He spoke as never man spoke, in notes of
   warning, yet wooing love--they still would not listen to Him. But they
   took Him and, with wicked hands, they crucified Him! It was their own
   rebellious will that ruined them. They would not come to Him that they
   might have life. There is where the guilt lies and, when sinners go to
   Hell it is because they will to go there! When they are condemned by
   the Judge who must do right, it is because they willedto pursue the sin
   which entailed condemnation! If they have not obtained mercy, their
   ruin shall lie at the door of their own wicked will! This shall be the
   thunder which shall pursue them through all the caverns of

   Hell--"You would not! You would not! You would not! On your own head
   must the guilt of your condemnation fall! You would not have eternal
   life--you willfully put it from you and refused it!"

   Now, there, or somewhere about there--I do not quite know where--there
   is a great doctrinal difficulty, but I do not think you or I need go
   fishing for it. If there is a bone in the meat, I do not ask to have it
   put on my plate. And if there is a bone in this text, let any dog that
   likes have it! As for us, there is the meat on which our soul may feed,
   the Truth that God lays at man's own door the guilt of his destruction!
   And Christ puts it thus, "I would, but you would not." I have, at this
   time, the pleasant task laid upon me of pointing out to you that what
   Christ would have done for the Jews, but which they would not accept, I
   am sure He would have done for us. No, I will go further and say that I
   am sure He is willing to do it for us right now! And so, remembering
   the past a little, I want you to dwell still more upon the present and
   to notice that, at this moment, Jesus is willing to gather us--to
   gather the children of this city together--as a hen gathers her
   chickens under her wings! Oh, I trust I may not have to say, "And you
   would not," but may the sweet Spirit of God be here to move the
   untoward and wicked wills of men till it shall be said, "Christ is
   willing to gather you, and you are willing to be gathered." When those
   two things come together, great blessing must result! I have read what
   astronomers have said about what would happen if two planets were in
   conjunction. I know nothing about that matter, but this I doknow--when
   these two thingscome into conjunction--when Christ would, and we
   would--there will be blessed times for us, peaceful days of which we
   have never dreamed! May the Spirit of God make it to be so even now!

   Now coming to the text, let us consider, first, what Jesus would do.
   Secondly, how He would do it And thirdly, when He would do it

   I. First, WHAT JESUS WOULD DO. "How often would I have gathered your
   children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings!"

   What does this mean? It is a very simple, homely, beautiful, touching
   simile--the hen gathering her chickens under her wings. And it means,
   first, that Jesus would make you feel quite safe. Look, there is the
   shadow of a hawk! The bird of prey is poised up yonder and the shadow
   is seen upon the ground. Or the mother hen, looking up, notices the
   destroyer and, in a moment, she gives a cluck of alarm and so calls
   together her little family. And in a few seconds they are all safe
   beneath her sheltering feathers--her wings become their efficient
   shield. Now, our Lord Jesus Christ would do just that with us. He would
   make us quite safe--take us out of the broad road of danger and then
   compass us about with the wings of His power so that we might not only
   be safe, but also feel quite safe.

   I suppose nothing feels safer than a little chick beneath the hen. That
   tiny creature has no gauge and measure of strength beyond its own
   weakness, so it reckons its mother to be incalculably strong and feels
   perfectly safe when it can hide its head within her breast feathers.
   Ah, but there are some of you who do not feel safe. You have never felt
   secure. Death is truly the king of terrors to you. You do not like to
   hear people talk about it and if you are ill, how quickly you send for
   the doctor--not because you have the symptoms of any very serious
   illness, but because you are afraid to die! Why, there are some of you
   so afraid that you hardly like to be left in a room in the dark--and
   you would scarcely dare to go upstairs without a candle! You are not
   afraid from mere natural timidity, but because you know that there is
   something that follows death for which you are not prepared! Things are
   out of order between you and God, and you know it. So the fall of a
   leaf, or the scratching of a mouse would disturb your mind, for you
   know that you are not in a state of safety.

   You could not bear to be at sea in a storm. The thought of shipwreck
   would have about it not only the natural terror which is inseparable
   from such an alarming event, but also the dread that the waves of fire
   might succeed the waves of the ocean! You are not safe even in your
   highest joys--a skeleton sits at the feast, for your pleasures are
   transient and you know it. When, easygoing man as you are, you have
   your greatest delight in earthly things, you are still conscious that
   there is a worm in the very center of the sweetest fruit and you are
   afraid of the consequences of eating it. Oh, but Jesus would have you
   spared from all this anxiety! He would have you covered so completely
   that you would not have known fear! He would have you brought into the
   enjoyment of that "perfect love" which "casts out fear: because fear
   has torment." He would have you made to be among the blessed ones of
   whom it is written, "He shall cover you with His feathers and under His
   wings shall you trust. His truth shall be your shield and buckler." And
   He is willing that this should be the case--that you, poor trembler,
   should come to Him, now, and feel no longer in jeopardy, but be safe
   forever!

   That hymn with which we commenced the service--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul"--

   is an exact reflex of what Christ is willing to bestow upon all who
   come to Him. He is willing to clasp to His bosom all who flee to Him
   for refuge. He is willing to take into the haven of perfect security
   the tempest-tossed vessel. He is willing to hide, as in the cleft of
   the rook, the sin and Satan-haunted spirit! It is so, dear Friends! I
   know it is so, for I have proved it! Look into the eyes, into the heart
   and into the wounds of Jesus, and you will know that there is no
   unwillingness in Him to give perfect safety to the souls that trust
   Him! He would make them to be in safety, "even as a hen gathers her
   chickens under her wings."

   But now I will go a step further and say that Jesus would also make
   them feel perfectly happy Chicks under a hen are not only the picture
   of safety, but they are the very emblem of happiness. Did you ever
   disturb them a little? If so, did you not notice the sweet little
   noises they made--the very sound of perfect contentment! If you have
   ever watched them as they stand, there, huddled together, you must have
   seen that it is their little paradise! They could not have been happier
   in the Garden of Eden than they are there, they are so blest. Beneath
   their mother's wings they have all that they can desire and, during the
   whole night, let it be what it may--let it blow cold, or warm--there
   they are perfectly safe and happy. Her heart is beating above them and
   her breast is yielding the warmth of life to keep them glad.

   I feel sure that I am addressing people who are not happy. The common
   idea of happiness that many persons have is a very strange one. When
   our London friends have a day's holiday, their notion of enjoying a
   rest often amuses me. They pack themselves away, as tightly as they
   can, inside and outside a van, or an omnibus, or a carriage--and then
   they go as far as they can till the weary horse can scarcely move to
   bring them home! And, all the while, to give rest to their ears and to
   their hearts, somebody blows a trumpet in a fashion that evokes very
   little music, and they riot all the day as if they were mad and disport
   themselves as if London consisted of one huge Bethlehem Hospital--and
   that is what they call happiness!

   My view of happiness would be to get as far as I could away from them,
   and to do the very reverse of what they are doing! These people talk
   about "the place to spend a happy day," "the way to be happy" and so
   on, but was ever a poor word so trailed in the dust as that word,
   "happy," is in such a connection as that? But, oh, a peaceful,
   contented mind that rests in God! A soul whose wishes are all fulfilled
   and whose very life-breath is jubilant praise or else submissive
   prayer--that is what I call happiness! The man who knows that all is
   right with him for eternity, one who drinks from the eternal fountain
   the joys which belong not to the brute beast, nor even to the man who
   is without a God--I call him the happy man! And, oh, how happy some of
   you would be if you came to Christ as the chicks come to the hen! Oh,
   how happy Christ would make you! Wretched woman over yonder, this very
   night you may be happy! Giant Despair has marked you for his own, you
   say. Then I challenge Giant Despair and call him a liar! If you believe
   in Christ, you shall find that He has redeemed you with His blood.
   Trust Him and He will set you free at once--and in Him you shall be as
   happy as the days are long at the longest and you shall know what true
   joy means--emphatic joy--"the joy of the Lord," "the peace of God which
   passes all understanding!"

   I remind you of that other hymn we sang just now--

   "Take salvation, Take it now, and happy be"--

   not only safe, but happy! And safe and happy forever! I remember how I
   was enticed to Christ when I heard the Doctrine of the Final
   Perseverance of Saints preached. I had heard a great deal about that
   kind of salvation which consists of being saved today and lost,
   tomorrow, and I never cared a button for it--neither would I go across
   the street to listen to it now! But I heard a salvation preached which
   really saves a man--saves him eternally--and I felt that if I could get
   a grip of thatsalvation, I would be the happiest individual in the
   world! By God's Grace I did grip it and I found it truthful and fact,
   for Christ does save--saves effectually and eternally--all them that
   put their trust in Him. And even now, for the unsafe and for the
   unhappy, Christ is waiting and willing that they may be both safe and
   happy in Him!

   But there is more bliss, even, than that, for Christ makes them part of
   a blessed company. He says in our text, "How often would I have
   gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens
   under her wings!" It is not a hen with one chick to which our Savior
   alludes! I suppose that the one chick might be happy, but the best
   happiness in the world is always enjoyed in holy company. Christ gives
   the idea of a Church as His notion of happiness--not one member only,
   but a body of members! Not one lone sheep, but a flock! So here he
   says, "How often would I have gathered your children together!" Am I
   addressing some lonely person? You have been in London a long time and
   you have found out that there is no place so lonely as this great
   London is. I suppose that in the desert of Sahara, you might find a
   friend, although in Cheapside you could not. Nobody seems to know
   anybody here--that is to say, unless he has something to give away--and
   then the number of cousins that a man has is something amazing! But if
   you need anything, nobody knows you and even your so-called friends
   forsake you! Perhaps somebody has come to the Tabernacle for a good
   while and yet has been quite lonely. I am very sorry that it should
   ever be and I know that there are some earnest souls here that try to
   speak to strangers. But, oh, dear Friends, my Master would not have you
   lonely! He would gather you with the rest of His children, "even as a
   hen gathers her chickens under her wings." He would bring you to know a
   few burdened spirits like yourself. He would bring you to know some
   others that have been set free, as He will set you free! And He would
   lead you to have fellowship here with one, and there with another, till
   you would say with good Dr. Watts--

   "In such society as this

   My weary soul would rest--

   The man that dwells where Jesus is,

   Must be forever blessed!"

   You would find that your joys would be multiplied by being shared with
   your kindred in Christ who, on the other hand, would make you partakers
   of their joy and would delight to do so! Oh, that you would come to
   Christ, for then you would have the happiness of Christian fellowship!

   It seems to me that there is also another thought in the text, that is,
   Jesus would make us know His love. When the hen gathers her chickens
   under her wings, there is not only safety, happiness and congenial
   society, but there is also a consciousness of great love. The poor
   little chickens do not understand much about it--they do not know what
   relationship the hen bears to them, but shedoes. Yet they feel that she
   loves them by the way she picks up every little grain for them and by
   the way she calls them together so anxiously, and covers them so
   carefully. It is a truly blessed experience to know a great love--the
   love that is equal to our own--that blessed marriage love renders life
   supremely happy where it is purely enjoyed. But how much more blessed
   is it to have a love infinitely superiorto your own and yet to know
   that it is all yours and that whatever there is in that loving One is
   all for you! Every chick may feel sure that whatever the great bird can
   do, it will all be done for the little bird that cowers beneath its
   wings. In fact, the chicks are lost in the hen-- look how she covers
   them! That is what Jesus does to me and to you, if we are truly in
   Him--He covers us up and hides us from all our enemies. They cannot see
   us, for we are lost in our Lord and yet we are most sweetly found, and
   put beyond the possibility of being lost! All that Jesus is belongs to
   me, and to you, dear Sister, and to you, dear Brother. All Christ is
   mine, and all Christ is yours! And as the hen gives herself up to her
   chick and takes the chick, as it were, wholly to herself so that they
   become one, so does the blessed Christ give Himself wholly to His
   people--He takes His people wholly up into Himself, so that they are
   truly one! Oh, that you all had this great blessing! And if you are
   waiting and anxious and desirous to have it, He is willing to give it,
   for so He says in the text, "How often would I have gathered your
   children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings!"

   That is what Jesus would do.

   II. Now, very briefly, let us consider HOW HE WOULD DO IT.

   He would do it, first, by calling you to come to Him. That is how the
   hen gathers her chicks around her, by calling them to her. Christ's
   call is often given by the preaching of the Gospel and I am truly glad
   when I can be His call-boy and pass on the message from Him. How I wish
   these lips had language conformable to the blessed call which He allows
   me to deliver in His name! He bids me tell you, who labor and are heavy
   laden, to come to Him, to come to Him, now, and He will give you rest.
   He says, "Ho, every one that thirsts, come to the waters, and he that
   has no money; come, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without
   money and without price." He bids me expressly say that he that comes
   to Him, He will in no wise cast out. And I am glad that before He
   closed the Book of the Revelation, He put in this gracious message,
   "Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely." That is how He
   would gather you by His call--is it not a sweet and gracious one? If
   you are His child, you will know it and come to Him, even as the chick
   knows the mother's call and runs to her. There is a pigeon not far from
   the hen, but it does not come at her call. There is a duck in the
   farmyard, but it does not come to her. Ah, but the chicks do! And this
   is how the Lord discerns His elect and redeemed people--that gracious
   call of His is understood by those who secretly belong to Him and who,
   therefore, respond to His call. He Himself said, "All that the Father
   gives Me shall come to Me; and he that comes to Me, I will in no wise
   cast out."

   How would Jesus gather you to Him? Well, He would gather you, next, by
   your coming at His call The hen gives a call and then the chicks run to
   her. What do they bring with them when they come? Do they pick up gold
   and silver, or bring diamonds in their mouths to pay their way to their
   mother's bosom? No, not they! All they do is to run to her, just as
   they are! Can you see them? The mother hen has called them and away
   they go! They bring her nothing and she asks nothing of them. It is for
   the hen to give to the chick--not for the chick to give to the hen! And
   so, poor Sinner, all you have to do is to come and trust Jesus. Run to
   Him! What shall you bring Him? Bring Him nothing but your need of
   everything that He can give you! Shall you bring Him a broken heart?
   Yes, if you have one, but if you have not, come to Him and ask Him to
   give you a broken heart. Remember that verse of Hart's--

   "Come, you needy, come and welcome,

   God's free bounty glorify!

   True belief and true repentance,

   Every Grace that brings us nigh,

   Withoutmoney,

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy!"

   So, then, this is Christ's way of gathering sinners to Himself. First,
   He gives the call, and then they come to Him in obedience to it.

   The next part of the gathering is the enclosure of His wing by which He
   interposes between us and harm. The hen gathers her chicks to her by
   brooding over them, making herself like a wall round about them, her
   feathers being their soft nestling-place. So Jesus gathers us to Him by
   brooding over us. He puts Himself between us and justice. You know when
   He did it and how He suffered in doing it. He puts Himself between us
   and God, for He is the Mediator, the Inter-poser, the Daysman acting on
   our behalf. Oh, how sweet it is when, conscious of guilt and sin, we,
   nevertheless, can realize the sweetness of that promise which I have
   already quoted to you, "He shall cover you with His feathers, and under
   His wings shall you trust." He shall Himself be your pavilion! He shall
   hide you from the righteous wrath of God and put your sin away by
   taking it upon Himself! That is the way we are gathered under the
   interposing Mediator.

   How does He gather us? You have it all before you now--He calls us, and
   we come to Him and we hide beneath Him and cry--

   "Cover my defenseless head With the shadow of Your wings."

   That is how we are gathered to Him--may the Lord thus graciously gather
   us all!

   III. Our last remark, concerning our being gathered to Christ, is to be
   WHEN HE WOULD DO IT. The text says, "How often would I have gathered
   your children together!" I will not go into an account of the many
   times in which Jesus, in His infinite love, would have gathered the
   children of Jerusalem to Himself, but I should like to mention some
   times when, I think, He would have gathered some of you.

   He would have gathered you, first, when you were literally children. I
   mean especially those of you who had early advantages. When you went to
   bed, after mother had spoken to you about--

   "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild," and given you the "good-night" kiss, you
   would often lie awake and turn the subject over in your mind till the
   tears coursed down your little cheeks and you sobbed yourself asleep. I
   think Jesus would have gathered you then. Do not some of us recall,
   when we were boys, when we spoke to an elder brother, or, maybe, to a
   younger brother, and we two reasoned with one another about these
   things-- and prayed in our boyish fashion--and yet in a few days had
   forgotten it all? I think Jesus would have gathered us to Him then.

   In looking back over my own life, there seems to me to have been times
   when the Lord came very near my childish spirit and touched me, if not
   with Divine Life, yet with something very near akin to it, for there
   were many earnest desires after holiness, bitter feelings of repentance
   and mighty yearnings after the Christ of whom I knew so little, but for
   whom I longed so much! Ah, my aged Friend, am I describing your case?
   It is a long while since you were a boy, but you might almost wish you
   could be a child again to feel as you once felt! Ah, good woman, it is
   many a day since mother ran her fingers through your curls and said
   that she hoped you would love her Savior! And you do not feel, now, as
   you felt then. Those were certainly times when Jesus would have
   gathered you to Himself.

   Since then, I daresay many of you have had times of serious impression
   and quiet thoughtfulness. You do not know why it was, but you suddenly
   felt unusually thoughtful. It may be that you have been in the midst of
   gaiety and you have felt that it was all hollow. You could not bear it,
   so you got away and went upstairs, or into the garden, or you have even
   walked the street as if nobody else were there but yourself. And you
   have thought, and thought, and thought, again, and you have almost been
   persuaded--but you have said to the Heavenly message, "Go your way for
   this time. It is not yet convenient for me to receive you." Do you
   think it will ever be convenient? Or is God to wait your convenience
   and play the lackey at your door till your supreme will shall deign to
   listen to His merciful requests? Ah, how often--how often would Jesus,
   thus, by these solemn impressions, have gathered unto Himself some who
   are here present!

   It may be that I am coming a little more closely home to some when I
   remind them that they have had periods of severe illness. At such times
   you have lain in bed and listened to the tick of the clock on the bed
   table and you have looked into eternity--and it has appeared very grim
   and dark to you. And you have then sought the prayers of good men and
   you have vowed that if you ever recovered, there should be no more
   wasted years, Ah, then Christ would have gathered you to Himself and
   the shadow of His sheltering wings darkened your sick-chamber! But you
   would not yield and you escaped from Him, again, and yet again.

   I think I may truthfully add that in this Tabernacle, sometimes, when
   God has helped the preacher, there have been moments when you have been
   brought to the very brink of salvation--and you have almost gone in.
   You have had to put pressure upon your conscience to keep out of the
   Pool of Mercy! You have had to resist the Holy Spirit. Oh, but it is a
   dreadful thing when a man has done despite to the Spirit of God and
   made himself an antagonist of that blessed Spirit, whom to resist is
   perilous, for it is of Him that we read that there is a sin which is
   unto death--and there is a sin against the Holy Spirit which shall
   never be forgiven! I trust that none of you have yet committed that
   sin! But mind what you are doing--mind what you are doing, for you are
   in a most dangerous position! Somewhere in that region where you now
   are lies the sin which ensures damnation! I charge you, Sirs, whatever
   sin you commit, resist not the Holy Spirit, for, if you do, it may be
   that it shall be said, "My Spirit shall no longer strive with that
   man." And then, ah, then--I drop the curtain and say no more, for it is
   too terrible to think of.

   Oh, how I wish that this might be the time when Jesus would securely
   cover you as the hen covers her chicks! Do you really desire this
   blessing? I know you would not desire it if He did not desire it. If
   there is a spark of desire towards Christ in your heart, there is a
   whole flaming furnace of desire in Christ's heart towards you! You
   never get the best of Him--long before you have gone half a boat's
   length, you shall find Jesus Christ infinitely faster than you are! No
   sinner can ever say that he stopped for Christ, or waited for Jesus. I
   more willing than Christ? Never! A sinner more anxious for pardon than
   Christ is willing to pardon him? Never! There was never seen and there
   never shall be seen, beneath the cape of Heaven, a soul more hungry
   after Christ than Christ is hungry after that soul! Long before the
   woman of Samaria said to Christ, "Give me a drink," Christ had said to
   her, "Give Me a drink." He was the more thirsty of the two, even when
   He had made her thirsty! And He was thirsty after her soul long before
   she was thirsty after the Water of Life!

   O poor, guilty Sinner, do not doubt your welcome to Jesus! The gate of
   salvation is flung wide open! The door is taken completely off the
   hinges. "All things are ready, come!" Your Savior waits for you. The
   Father waits for you. No, He does more--He comes to meet you! I see Him
   running! Is it true that I see youcoming? Then what a spectacle is now
   before me! I see you coming with feeble footsteps and I see Him running
   faster than the angels fly! I see the Father falling on the neck of the
   prodigal. I see Him kiss him and delight in him and cover him as if it
   were the hen that covered her chick! I see Him delighting in deeds and
   tokens of infinite love. "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him!
   And put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet, and bring here the
   fatted calf, and kill it and let us eat and be merry; for this, my son,
   was dead, and is alive again! He was lost, and is found!"

   "Ring the bells of Heaven!" There is joy tonight, for a sinner has
   found his Savior and God has found His child! God bless you, dear
   Friends, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 13:18-34.

   Verse 18. Then said He, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? And unto
   what shall I resemble it? For men learn much by resemblances and the
   things which are seen are frequently helpful to us in seeking to set
   forth the things which are not seen. Knowing that God is One in all
   that He has done, we are often able to learn from one part of His works
   to understand another. What, then, is God's Kingdom like? Is it like a
   mighty army marching with banners and trumpets? No. Is it like the
   raging sea, rolling onwards and sweeping everything before it? Not
   so--at least it is not so visibly.

   19. It is like a grain of mustard seed. You can hardly see it. You can,
   however, taste it. Try it and you shall find it pungent enough, but it
   is so small that you may easily pass it by. "It is like a grain of
   mustard seed."

   19. Which a man took and cast into his garden. I t must be sown in
   prepared soil, but there is "a man" who knows how to cast it so that it
   shall fall where it will live and where it will grow.

   19. And it grew, and grew into a great tree; and the fowls of the air
   lodged in the branches of it ' 'The fowls of the air" that might once
   have eaten it, "lodged in the branches of it." See, in this parable, an
   illustration of the growth of the Kingdom of God, the vitality of the
   Truth of God, the energy with which, from a small beginning, God's
   Kingdom advances to a great ending! Have you this mustard seed in your
   heart? It may seem a very little thing even to yourself. Others may
   scarcely perceive it, yet, but leave it alone and it will grow. Yet it
   will not grow without watering. Seeds may lie long in the ground, but
   they will not sprout until the rain has fallen to moisten the earth.
   Pray God to send showers of blessing upon your soul, tonight, so that,
   even if you have no more than a grain of mustard seed in your heart, it
   may begin to grow!

   Is the grain of mustard seed sending up its shoot above the ground?
   Then pray God that it may grow yet more till it shall not only be
   visible, but shall be so prominent that it must be seen--that those who
   once hated it will be compelled to see it--and to wonder at it as they
   behold the birds of the air coming and lodging in its branches! I pray
   that in many hearts, here, the Grace of God may not long continue to be
   a small thing, but that it may advance to tree-like stature till you
   shall yield comfort to fifties and hundreds--and many of you shall be
   like some of the trees in this great city and its suburbs. Did you ever
   notice them, at nightfall, when all the sparrows of the street come and
   lodge in the branches and merrily twitter before they go to sleep?
   There are some Christians like those trees--they have hearts so big and
   they do for Christ's service so much, that they harbor hundreds of poor
   little birds of the air that otherwise would hardly know where to go
   for shelter. God make us such Christians that we shall be a blessing to
   multitudes all around us!

   20, 21. And again He said, Unto what shall I liken the Kingdom of God?
   It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal,
   till the whole was leavened. Some expositors think that this is a
   picture of the kingdom of the devil, but it does not say so. If our
   Lord had meant to represent the power of evil, He would have given us
   some intimation of that kind, but He has given us none. He means to
   describe exactly what He had described before, for He says, "Unto what
   shall I liken the Kingdom of God?" The leaven is buried, as it
   were--"hid in three measures of meal." It is lost, covered up. Leave it
   alone. By the force that is within itself, it begins to work its way in
   the meal and it leavens all around it until, at last, the whole three
   measures of meal are permeated by it and made to feel and acknowledge
   its power. So is it with the Grace of God where it is placed within a
   human heart--and so is it with the Kingdom of God wherever its
   influence is exerted among the sons of men!

   22, 23. And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
   journeying toward Jerusalem. Then said one unto Him, Lord, are there
   few that are saved?Oh, that question! Have you ever asked it? Have you
   ever heard it asked? And there are some people who are very pleased
   when the answer is, "Yes, very few, indeed, will be saved--and they all
   go to Salem, or Zoar, or Rehoboth, or little Bethel." There are some
   who are not quite certain whether all who go even therewill be
   saved--they seem to delight to cut and pare down to the very lowest the
   number of those who will be saved. With such a spirit as that, I trust
   we do not sympathize for a moment! Certainly, our Lord does not! Listen
   to His reply to the question, "Lord, are there few that are saved?"

   23, 24. AndHe said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate;
   for many, Isay unto you, willseek to enter in, and shall not be able.
   For your own part, take it for granted that there will be so few that
   will enter that you will have to push to get through the gate--"Strive
   to enter in at the narrow gate." If you are not narrow in your own
   mind--and it is a pity that you should be--yet remember that the gate
   into Heaven is narrow--and make up your mind that there is no getting
   through it except with many a push and many a squeeze.

   25, 26. When once the Master of the house is risen up, and has shut the
   door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying,
   Lord, Lord, open unto us; and He shall answer and say unto you, I know
   not who you are: then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk
   in Your Presence, and You have taught in our streets. See, there are
   some men who will not think of going to Heaven till it is too late! And
   then, when they get to Heaven's gate and find it shut, they will begin
   to plead for admittance though they pleaded not for it before! When
   they might have had the blessing, they would not have it. And when they
   cannothave it, then they grow earnest in crying for it.

   27, 28. But He shall say, I tell you, I know not who you are; depart
   from Me, all you workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and
   gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
   and all the Prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust
   out. Ejected, violently driven away, as those who are abhorrent in
   God's sight because you despised His mercy!

   29-34. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
   the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of
   God. And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
   first which shall be last. The same day there came certain of the
   Pharisees, saying unto Him, Get out, and depart from here, for Herod
   will kill You. And He said unto them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I
   cast out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I
   shall be perfected. Nevertheless I must walk today, and tomorrow, and
   the day following: for it cannot be that a Prophet perish outside of
   Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the Prophets, and stones
   them that are sent unto you; how often would I have gathered your
   children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and
   you would not! What a terrible contrast! "I would...and you would not."
   May the Lord Jesus never have to say that to any of us!

Israel's Cry and God's Answer

   (No. 2631)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 16, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   23, 1882.

   "And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died:
   and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
   cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. And God
   heard their groaning, and God remembered His Covenant with Abraham,
   with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel,
   and God had respect unto them...Now therefore, behold, the cry of the
   children of Israel has come to Me: and I have also seen the oppression
   with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will
   send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the children
   of Israel, out of Egypt." Exodus2:23-25; 3:9,10.

   GOD had chosen the children of Israel, and He had determined to make of
   them a great nation and a peculiar people to whom He could communicate
   the Law and the Testimony, that they might keep the heavenly lamp
   burning until Christ should come. Jacob and his family had gone down
   into Egypt and, for a long time, they and their descendants were very
   happy there. The land of Goshen was very fruitful and the Israelites
   were greatly favored by the Egyptian king. The mass of them, therefore,
   had little thought of ever leaving that country--they resolved that
   they would settle there permanently. In fact, though God would not have
   it so, they became Egyptians as much as they could. They were a part of
   the Egyptian nation and they began to forget their separate origin. In
   all probability, if they had been left to themselves, they would have
   been melted and absorbed into the Egyptian race and lost their identity
   as God's special people. They were content to be in Egypt and they were
   quite willing to be "Egyptianized." To a large degree, they began to
   adopt the superstitions, idolatries and iniquities of Egypt. And these
   things clung to them, in later years, to such a terrible extent that we
   can easily imagine that their heart must have turned aside very much
   towards the sins of Egypt. Yet, all the while, God was resolved to
   bring them out of that evil connection. They must be a separated
   people--they could not be Egyptians, nor yet live permanently like
   Egyptians, for Jehovah had chosen them for Himself, and He meant to
   make an abiding difference between Israel and Egypt.

   Now see the parallel. God still has a people whom He has chosen to be
   His own in a very peculiar sense, but they are, at present, mixed up
   with the world. They are in the world and they are, at least in
   appearance, ofthe world. They are as fond of sin and as much slaves to
   sin as others are. They even love the world and the things of it--and
   many of them are quite happy where they are. They have no wish whatever
   to became a part of the separated people, set apart unto the Lord. They
   would rather remain in the world. But God will bring His redeemed out
   from the rest of mankind. He that bought them with blood will deliver
   them by power. Christ did not offer His Atonement in vain, but, "He
   shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." God will
   yet call every one of His sons and daughters out of Egypt, even as He
   called His Firstborn, and He will bring His chosen out of the midst of
   the people among whom they are sojourning until the time appointed for
   their emancipation.

   The first thing to be done with the Israelites was to cause them to be
   anxious to come out of Egypt, for it is not God's way to make men His
   servants, except so far as they willingly yield themselves to Him. He
   never violates the human will, though He constantly and effectually
   influences it. Jehovah wants not slaves to grace His throne and,
   therefore, God would not have the people dragged out of Egypt, or
   driven out in fetters, against their own glad consent. He must bring
   them out in such a way that they would be willing to come out, so that
   they would march forth with joy and delight, being thoroughly weary and
   sick of all Egypt and, therefore, rejoicing to get away from it. How
   was this to be done? It was accomplished by a new king coming up who
   knew not Joseph and his eminent services. This Pharaoh began to be
   jealous of the people, fearing that, some day, when Egypt was at war,
   Israel might turn and side with the Egyptians' enemies. He looked upon
   the people, therefore, as being a great danger, and determined, if he
   could, to thin their ranks. Hence, he issued the barbarous edict to
   slay all the male children and, to effectually break their spirit, he
   put them to hard labor in making bricks and erecting vast structures,
   so that the treasure cities of Egypt and, perhaps, some of her huge
   pyramids were built by the unpaid labors of Israelite slaves. The whip
   fell often and heavily upon their backs, for they were put under brutal
   taskmasters who beat them most shamefully. They had no rest. They had
   to toil on and on and on, and scarcely had bread enough to eat to keep
   body and soul together. At last, the yoke of bondage became altogether
   intolerable and then, as we have it in the first part of our text, "The
   children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and
   their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. And God heard
   their groaning, and God remembered His Covenant with Abraham, with
   Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and
   God had respect unto them."

   I want to use this subject in showing to any here who are in
   soul-trouble and do not understand why they have such sorrows and
   distress, that God is seeking to make them sick of the world, sick of
   sin and, therefore, He is putting them into a condition of spiritual
   bondage so that they may be willing to come out of Egypt! Yes, that
   they may, by-and-by, with the utmost joy and gladness, leave the land
   of their captivity!

   I. The first thing I have to speak about is THE CRY OF MISERY. "The
   children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and
   their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. And God heard
   their groaning."

   Notice, first, that they began to sigh, and to cry because their time
   of prosperity had passed. The land of Goshen might still be very
   fruitful, but their taskmasters devoured their substance. The country
   might be fair to look upon, but they had no time to enjoy the prospect.
   They were worked well-nigh to death and they could no longer get any
   rest in Egypt. All their prosperity and happiness had departed. Am I
   addressing any who were once very well content and satisfied to live as
   ordinary worldlings do? And has everything changed with you? Is there
   now no joy in what was once such a pleasure to you? Does it seem very
   dull and dreary if you go where you used to find so much merriment?
   Those haunts which were once the scene of your greatest delight--are
   they now avoided by you because you cannot endure them? Do you now feel
   that you would gladly give up all those things which once you doted on?
   I am thankful to hear that it is so, for when God is about to give a
   man a drink of the cup of salvation, He often first puts his taste
   right by washing out his mouth with a draught of bitters to take away
   the flavor of the accursed sweets of sin! I always regard it as a good
   and hopeful sign when a man becomes tired of the world, altogether
   weary of its sins, and says, "I find no pleasure in them." This happens
   to some while they are still young and their passions are strong--while
   their substance is undiminished, while their health is vigorous--while
   their friends are numerous. In the very middle of the day, their sun of
   enjoyment seems to go down. There is the honey, but it is no longer
   sweet. There is the wine cup, but it has no further fascination for
   them. Their joy has departed just when one would have thought that it
   would have been most abiding with them. Do I speak to any in this
   condition? If so, I think that I bring a message from the Lord to them!

   But, next, the Israelites had not only lost their former prosperity,
   but they began to feel that they were in bondage. An Israelite in Egypt
   was at first a gentleman--in fact, a nobleman--for was he not related
   to the great prime minister, Joseph, who was second only to Pharaoh
   himself? Every Jew walked through Goshen as an aristocrat, for he was
   intimately connected with almost the highest in the realm! But now all
   that was changed with them and they felt that they were slaves--they
   were in bitter bondage--they must act and move at the will of others.
   There were hard laws and regulations made for them and cruel
   taskmasters to put those laws in action. They must rise, not when they
   chose, but when they were told to, and they might get to their beds
   only when they were allowed to do so at the slave driver's will. And
   they felt that they could not bear it any longer.

   This was God's way of bringing them out of bondage, by first making
   them feel that they were in slavery. Have I any here who realize that
   they are also in slavery? Am I addressing a man who feels that he is in
   bondage to evil habits which he cannot break, although he wishes that
   he could and counts himself degraded by the fact that to will is
   present with him, but how to perform that which he would, he finds not
   because he is a slave? His passions rule him. His companions control
   him. He dares not do what his conscience tells him is right, for there
   is a fear of somebody or other that makes him into a coward, and so
   into a slave. I am always glad when the fetters begin to gall. They who
   are content to be in bondage will never be freed! But when they feel
   that they cannot and that they will not any longer endure their
   captivity, then has the hour of freedom struck! It is an untold
   blessing when the Grace of God makes a man feel that what was once a
   pleasure has now become a servitude--and what he formerly found to be
   liberty has now become utter slavery to him.

   The Israelites went further than that. They now felt that their burdens
   were too heavy to be borne. They had worked and toiled very hard and
   they had lived through the work, but now they were made to serve with
   rigor and their bondage was too heavy to be endured. They could not
   bear it. And it is the same spiritually! As long as a man can carry his
   sins, he will continue to carry them. And as long as a man can be
   content with the pleasures of this world, rest assured that he will
   delight in them. It is a blessed thing when sin becomes an awful load,
   so that it crushes a man until he seems to sink utterly hopeless
   beneath it! It is well with him, for now he will welcome the Deliverer.
   He will be glad of pardon from Him who, alone, can forgive sins. He
   will rejoice to accept the word of absolution from the lips of the
   Great High Priest and, therefore, although it is often a sore sorrow,
   it is also a very great mercy to be made to feel the intolerable load
   and burden of sin. If I am speaking to any who are in such a
   condition--and I hope that I am--I congratulate them on what is yet to
   come to them!

   Oh, well do I remember when I was such a slave--when, as I rose in the
   morning, I resolved to live better than I had previously done, yet,
   long before noon, I had made a worse mess of the day than ever! Then I
   thought that, perhaps, by increasing my prayers, or reading more of the
   Scriptures, I might get ease from my burden. But I found the more I
   prayed and the more I read, the heavier my burden became! If I tried to
   forget my sorrow and so to shake off my gloom, I found that it would
   not forget me--and I had to cry unto the Lord, with David, "Day and
   night Your hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the
   drought of summer." I remember all that painful time so vividly that I
   can speak to some of you like an experienced friend who is well
   acquainted with the dark and stony road on which you are walking. I
   know all about your painful pathway of grief and I long to help you to
   get over it quickly, and to come to a better and happier place! But
   this trial is God's way of fetching you out of Egypt. He is making the
   house of bondage too hot for you. He does not mean to let you stay
   there, so He is permitting all this to come upon you that you may cry
   unto Him to deliver you! He will bring you forth and you shall march
   out with joy and gladness, thankful and happy to do what now seems like
   a hardship and like self-denial to you.

   These Israelites also felt one more thing, namely, their powerlessness
   to escape out of Pharaoh's hand, and they thought that there was nobody
   to help them. When the young man of 40, who had been educated in
   Pharaoh's court, came forward and was reckoned to be the son of
   Pharaoh's daughter. When he came forward like a true hero, he threw in
   his lot with the despised people and smote one of their adversaries. He
   thought, perhaps, that it would be the signal for a general revolt and
   that the banner of Israel would wave defiantly in the face of Pharaoh
   and that the people would boldly march to liberty. But they were too
   enslaved--they had been too long ground down and oppressed to act like
   that-- they had lost all spirit and they did not hope to ever be free!
   They were a nation of hopeless slaves.

   Am I speaking to any here who have lost all heart and hope--who have
   come to this place of worship with a sort of feeble wish for salvation,
   but with no expectation of receiving it? Are you so shut up in the
   prison of sin that you cannot come forth? Are your chains clanking in
   your ears? Do you feel yourself to be in the low dark dungeon out of
   which you will never come alive? It is to you I have to say that I
   bless God that you are where you are! Despair is a blessed preparation
   for faith in Jesus! The end of the creature is the beginning of the
   Creator. Your extremity is God's opportunity. Now that you are helpless
   and hopeless, God will come to your rescue!

   You notice that in my text there is a gradation, and such a gradation
   as some of us have felt in spiritual things. "The children of Israel
   sighed by reason of the bondage." "Ah, miserable wretch! Woe is me!
   Alas! Alas!" That is how they sighed when they were at their labor.
   That is how they sighed when they went home at night, or lay down among
   the pots by the kiln. And that is how they sighed when they woke up in
   the morning. When a boy was born, they sighed as they looked at him,
   for they knew that he must be killed. "The children of Israel sighed by
   reason of the bondage." And, then, as their misery grew, a sigh was not
   enough. "And they cried." Ah, I cannot imitate the expressive language
   of their grief. There were often many tears and there was the voice of
   grief which made itself audible in piercing cries. "O God, how long
   shall this bondage last?" They sat them down and begged for death--and
   sought it as if they were seeking for hidden treasure, for the life of
   a slave in Egypt was intolerable to them. And, often, the sigh and the
   cry were merged into a groan, for we read, "God heard their groaning."

   Is that how it has been going on with you, my Brother? You used to sigh
   a good deal. Sometimes people noticed that you were very absent-minded
   and that you seemed to have some sorrow upon your spirit which you
   could not express. Now you have gone further than that, for you have
   begun to cry and in prayer to God, you pour out your very soul!
   Perhaps--and that is the worst plight of all--you feel that you cannot
   pray. You do not seem to be able to offer what you regard as a real
   prayer. You can only weep--yes, and perhaps you cannot even weep--and
   so you sigh and groan because you cannot pray. You are troubled because
   you cannot be troubled enough. And that is the worst kind of trouble
   that there is in the world! There are none so brokenhearted as those
   that are brokenhearted because they are not brokenhearted! I have
   reminded you that the Israelites groaned and that "God heard their
   groaning." Ah, from the very bottom of their heart came up their
   groaning! It was no mere heaving of a sigh. It was no mere utterance of
   a cry. But all day long it was groaning, groaning, groaning--each
   breath seemed to be yet another sorrowful groan!

   I hope that many of you will find the Savior before you know much about
   this terrible groaning, but it was not so with me. I became so full of
   groans that I understood what Job meant when he said, "My soul chooses
   strangling and death rather than my life." It would be better never to
   live than to live forever under conviction of sin, for the arrows of
   God drink up the very fountains of our life, pour fire into the blood
   and make us feel as if a thousand deaths were preferable to living
   under an awful sense of God's wrath! Perhaps I am speaking to some who,
   even when they fall asleep, are startled by dreams concerning the Day
   of Judgment, the sound of the archangel's trumpet and the setting up of
   the Great White Throne. And when they wake and go out to their
   business, they make strange blunders--and all day long they are like
   men walking as in a dream.

   Still, dear Friends, if that is your experience, I am heartily glad of
   it, for it is to me a sign of better days coming! Looking down upon
   Egypt, the angels must have been glad when they heard the sighs and
   cries and groans of Israel. "Why," you ask, "how is that?" Because the
   angels would say to themselves, "God's greatest difficulty is overcome!
   He wanted to incline these people to come out of Egypt and now they
   long to come out--so they will be willing to accept the leader whom God
   will send to them and, with music and dancing, they will come forth
   when Moses brings them out of the iron furnace and the house of
   bondage." Those of us who were, only a little while ago, in the house
   of bondage, rejoice that we have been set free from it! And we are
   praying that you who are still in it and are beginning to feel what a
   horrible place it is, may not stay there long. May tomorrow's sun not
   see you there, but may you escape at once from that terrible captivity!

   That, then, is the first head--a cry of misery.

   II. The second is a very blessed one, THE GOD OF PITY. Let me read part
   of the text again. "They cried, and their cry came up unto God by
   reason of the bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered
   His Covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked
   upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them."

   Here, then, is the poor sinner's hope--not at all in himself, but
   wholly in God! Note the gradations here with regard to God's pity for
   these people. First, "their cry came up unto God." When it rose up
   sharp, shrill and intense, it burst through the gates of Heaven and
   "came up unto God." Not that He does not really hear everything, but,
   speaking after the manner of men, when it was a mere sigh, it did not
   reach Him. But when it got to be a cry and deepened into a groan, then
   it came up before Him and He seemed to stop and say, "What is that? It
   is the cry of the seed of Abraham in Egypt." Oh, poor Soul, when your
   cry comes up from the depths of your very soul, then God will stop and
   say, "What is that? It is the cry of a man in misery. It is the voice
   of a soul that is in bondage under sin." "Their cry came up unto God."

   Notice, next, for it is a step further--"and God heard their groaning."
   Do you know what that means? There are some people who seem to hear
   things, but the sounds pass through their ears and there the matter
   ends. But if you go to visit a sick woman and you sit down, and she
   tells you all about her ailments and about her poverty, she is cheered
   because you listen to her kindly and because you are willing to hear
   her even if you cannot help her--but it does help her even to tell her
   sad story. Well now, God heard Israel's crying and groaning. He heard
   them not merely as men hear a sound and take no notice of it, but He
   seemed to stand still and listen to the sighs, and groans, and cries of
   His people. Sinner, tell God your misery even now and He will hear your
   story! He is willing to listen, even, to that sad and wretched tale of
   yours about your multiplied transgressions, your hardness of heart,
   your rejections of Christ. Tell Him all, for He will hear it. Tell him
   what it is you need--what large mercy--what great forgiveness! Just lay
   your whole case before Him. Do not hesitate for a single moment! He
   will hear it, He will be attentive to the voice of your cry. Oh, what
   comfort there is for you in this Truth of God if you can but grasp it!
   Dear Christians, pray that some poor sinners may grasp it even now!
   Pray that they may lay hold upon the sweet thought that God is hearing
   the sighs and cries of the penitent souls in our midst!

   God's pity went further than that, for we read, next, that having heard
   their groaning, " God remembered His Covenant.'" I wish I knew how to
   preach upon that 24th verse--"God remembered His Covenant." He looked
   on the children of Israel and He did not remember their sins--their
   practically becoming Egyptians, their loving Egypt and Egypt's
   idols--but He remembered His friend, Abraham. He remembered Isaac. He
   remembered Jacob whom He loved, and He remembered how He had promised
   to bless them and to make them a blessing. And not because of any merit
   in the Israelites, themselves, but for the sake of those whom He had
   loved and honored, and for the sake of the Covenant which He had made
   with them, He said, "I will break the power of Pharaoh, and I will
   bless My people; I will bring them out of bondage, and set them at
   liberty." Sinner, if God were to look on you to all eternity, He could
   not see anything in you but what He is bound to punish! But when He
   looks on His dear Son whom He loves, and remembers how He lived and
   loved, and bled and died, and made atonement for the guilty. And when
   He remembers His Covenant with His Well-Beloved, He says, "I will bless
   these people whom I gave unto Him by an Everlasting Covenant. I
   promised that He would see of the travail of His soul and so He shall.
   I will break the power of sin and I will set these captives free to the
   praise of the glory of My Grace. And they shall be accepted in the
   Beloved." It is a great blessing that although God cannot see any
   reason for mercy in us, He can see the best of all reasons for mercy in
   the Covenant of His Grace and in His dear Son with whom He made it!
   "God remembered His Covenant." Do not forget it, dear Friends, but
   think much upon the Covenant ordered in all things and sure, and upon
   all the blessings that are to come to you through that Covenant.

   God did still more for His people. "And God looked upon the children of
   Israel" He had given them His ear. He had given them His memory. Now He
   gives them His eyes. He stood still and He looked upon them in pity and
   in love. And it is further said, "And God had respect unto them." The
   margin renders it, "God knew them," which is the true meaning of the
   original. He looked upon a man and He said, "That is one of My
   children." He looked upon another and He said, "Yes, Egyptian though he
   is in dress, he is one of my Israelites." He looked upon others and He
   said, "I know them. I know their sorrows, I know their sins, I know
   their weaknesses. And I will surely deliver them." Oh, that these lips
   could utter language in which I might fitly tell you how God looks upon
   you, my dear brokenhearted fellow sinner--how He looks upon you, my
   poor troubled Friend who cannot break loose from sin, but feels like a
   bull in a net and cannot get free from it! I tell you that He is
   looking upon you in love and pity and that He knows your condition and
   is ready to help you! I will close my discourse by telling you what He
   has done to help you and, oh, may He give you Grace to lay hold of it,
   that you may find liberty this very hour!

   III. The last point is THE INSTRUMENT OF DELIVERANCE.

   God's power was quite sufficient to bring the people of Israel out of
   bondage, but He chose to deliver them by means of human
   instrumentality. God works for men by men, so He raised up Moses, and
   it was through Moses that the children of Israel were delivered. Now,
   for you, dear Captive, God has raised up a Prophet like unto Moses. One
   who is infinitely greater than Moses has come to deliver you!

   First, remember that Jesus, the Savior of men, is a Man like ourselves.
   This ought to encourage you to come to Him. Full of grief and broken
   down under a sense of sin, you dare not approach an absolute God--it
   would not be right that you should attempt to come to Him without a
   Mediator. But you may come to the one Mediator between God and men, the
   Man Christ Jesus, for He can fully sympathize with you! He is able to
   have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way,
   for He, Himself, in the days of His flesh, was compassed with
   infirmity. Well did Dr. Watts sing--

   "Till God in human flesh I see, My thoughts no comfort find. The holy,
   just, and sacred Three Are terrors to my mind! But if Immanuel's face
   appears,

   My hope, my joy begins!

   His name forbids my slavish fear,

   His Grace removes my sins!"

   Jesus Christ is a Man--therefore come boldly to Him, even as Israel
   might come to Moses! And Jesus is clothed with Divine authority and
   power, as Moses was. But more than that, He is what Moses was not, and
   could not be--Jesus is actually Divine! Jesus is God!'Oh, come, poor
   trembling Sinner, and trust your case in His hands, because nothing
   ever fails that He undertakes! He can break the power of the Pharaoh of
   your sins and set you free! Yes, even now He can bring you forth out of
   Egypt with the silver and gold of His abounding Grace. Only trust Him
   and follow Him, and be obedient to His commands, and all will be well
   with you.

   This Moses, being a man, yet clothed with Divine authority, gave
   himself entirely up to the people. He was such a lover of Israel that
   he lived entirely for the people and once, you will remember, he even
   said, as he pleaded for them, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin,
   and have made them gods of gold! Yet now, if You will forgive their
   sin--and if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book which You have
   written." Our Lord Jesus Christ, whom it is our joy to preach, was
   really made a curse for us. He actually stood in the sinner's place and
   bore the penalty of the sinner's guilt. Therefore, oh, trust Him!
   Perhaps I may be the means of leading some poor sinner to end his
   delaying and now to commit his spirit into the hand of the faithful
   Creator and Redeemer who died for him. And, dear Friend, if you will
   but trust Jesus with yourself, you shall be saved at once! I hope you
   are willing to come out of Egypt. If you are, you may do so. Christ has
   broken all the power of sin and He is willing, now, to set you free if
   you will but trust Him and give yourself up, once and for all, entirely
   to His power!

   Lastly, Moses did bring the people out, every one of them. He left not
   a little babe in Egypt. No, not so much as a sheep or a goat remained
   there. He said, "There shall not a hoof be left behind." All that
   belonged to Israel went marching out when Moses led the way. And God's
   elect and Christ's redeemed shall all come out of the Egypt of sin.
   Pharaoh's power--the devil's power--cannot hold the very least of them
   in captivity! No, not even a bone of one of God's children shall be
   left in the grasp of death and the devil! They shall die and their
   bones shall be put into the sepulcher, but not the least atom of one of
   God's own chosen ones shall be left in the power of death! They shall
   come again from the hand of the enemy.

   Yet remember, O you Sinners, that I do not urge you to trust Christ as
   though He cringed at your feet and could not have honor and glory if
   you did not welcome Him as your Savior! If you will not come to Him. If
   you will turn your backs on Him, I shall only say of you, "You believe
   not because you are not of His sheep, as He said unto you." It is not
   for Christ's sake, but for your own sake that I plead with you! Oh,
   that you would come to Him and trust Him! Weary of self, and weary of
   sin, and hopeless of self-salvation, come and lay yourselves at Jesus'
   feet, even at the feet of Him whom God has "exalted with His right hand
   to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and
   forgiveness of sins" He has laid help upon One who is mighty! He has
   exalted One chosen out of the people! Therefore, come and trust Him
   even now, and you shall be saved! May God grant repentance and faith to
   this whole congregation for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS 7:14-43.

   Verses 14-17. Then sent Joseph, and called his father, Jacob, to him,
   and all his kindred, seventy-five souls. So Jacob went down into Egypt,
   and died, he, and our fathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and
   laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the
   sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. But when the time of the promise
   drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and
   multiplied in Egypt Note those words, "the time of the promise," and
   remember that every promise has its due time of fulfillment and that
   there is a time of promise to all the Lord's chosen people, when He
   will surely bring them out of bondage into the glorious liberty of the
   children of God.

   18-20. Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. The same dealt
   subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they
   cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. In which
   time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair, and nourished up in his
   father's house three months. In the darkest night of Israel's bondage
   in

   Egypt, her star of hope arose--"Moses was born and was exceedingly
   fair," or, as the margin has it, "was fair to God"--with a beauty
   something more than human.

   21, 22, And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and
   nourished him for her own son. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom
   of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. He was well
   qualified for the work to which God had called him, but how much more
   fully qualified is that great Prophet, like unto Moses, whom God has
   raised up, in these latter days, for the salvation of men, even Jesus
   Christ, His Son! He knows more than all the learning and wisdom of the
   Egyptians! He knows more than the cleverness of the devil, so He can
   deliver us from all his crafty wiles.

   23-25. And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to
   visit his brethren, the children of Israel And seeing one of them
   suffer wrong, he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed, and
   smote the Egyptian: for he supposed his brethren would have understood
   how that God, by his hand, would deliver them: but they understood not
   Alas, it is just the same with Israel now! The Lord Jesus came to His
   own and, according to one of His parables, the Father said of Him,
   "They will reverence My Son." But they did nothing of the kind! They
   said, "This is the Heir. Come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance
   shall be ours." And, alas, how many, nowadays, are imitating their evil
   example! They say, "We will not have this Man to reign over us!" They
   refuse to yield themselves to the Sovereignty of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   26-30. And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and
   would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brethren; why
   do you wrong one to another? But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust
   him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Will you
   kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday! Then fled Moses at this
   saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian where he begat two
   sons. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
   wilderness of Mount Sinai, an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
   bush. So that he was 80 years of age when he began his great lifework!
   Perhaps, as a rule, the larger part of our time is occupied in getting
   ready to work. Yet, if we are able to perform a work as good as that
   which Moses did, it will well repay us for a long season of
   preparation.

   31-34. When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
   to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying, I am the God
   of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
   of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not look. Then said the Lord
   to him, Take off your shoes from your feet: for the place where you
   stand is holy ground. I have seen, I have seen the affliction of My
   people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come
   down to deliver them. All this must have been very pleasant to the ears
   of Moses. It was solemn, yet it was exceedingly sweet. But notice what
   comes next.

   34. And now, come, I will send you into Egypt Oh, dear! What a
   falling-of there seems to be in these words! God first says, "I have
   heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them." And then He
   adds, "I will send you into Egypt." Yes, truly, from the grandeur of
   the Divine working down to the insignificance of our instrumentality is
   a tremendous stoop! Yet the God who says, "I will save sinners by My
   Grace; none but Myself can save them," also says to me, "Go and preach
   the Gospel to them." The same Lord who says, "I will change the heart
   of stone into a heart of flesh and work a miracle of mercy in renewing
   those who are dead in trespasses and sins," also says to you, "Speak to
   the persons sitting with you in the pew and seek to point them to the
   Savior." It is an amazing stoop, but it is the condescension of
   Almighty Grace and it brings great honor to the poor, trembling,
   unworthy person to whom the message is addressed! Moses thought himself
   very unfit for the task of delivering Israel and he would, if he had
   dared to do so, have refrained from that task. But God said to him,
   "Now come, I will send you into Egypt." Ah, Brothers, how different a
   man did Moses then become! When he went out by himself, without any
   commission, he was impatient to get to his work and he slew an
   Egyptian--and so had to flee the country. But when he was sent in God's
   name, when the Lord said to him, "Now come, I will send you," then the
   work was accomplished! O my Brothers and Sisters, in your service for
   the Savior, always seek for power from on high! Ask to be sent of God
   and pray your Master to go with you--then will you succeed in the task
   which He entrusts to you.

   35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a
   judge? The same did Godsend to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand
   of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush. Is not that a shadow of
   that grander Truth of God, "The Stone which the builders rejected, the
   same is become the Head of the corner"?

   36, 37. He brought them out after that he had showed wonders and signs
   in the land ofEgypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty
   years. This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, A
   Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
   like unto me; Him shall you hear Now you see that Moses was thus a type
   of Christ. God grant that we may not reject Christ, as the Israelites
   rejected Moses, but may we be willing that He should be to us our Judge
   and our Deliverer!

   38, 39. This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with
   the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who
   received the living oracles to give unto us: to whom our fathers would
   not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back
   again into Egypt Though Moses had brought them out of Egypt, they were
   not obedient to him and they wanted to go back to the land of bondage.
   And, ah, Brothers and Sisters, this is the great crime of the present
   day--the crime of mankind in general--that, after all Jesus has done,
   there is still within so many, the evil heart of unbeliefn departing
   from the living God!

   40, 41. Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for
   this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we not what is
   become of him. And they made a calf in those days, and offered
   sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
   This again is another of the ways by which men attempt to make an idol
   god out of something which they can see and to rejoice in what they,
   themselves, do, instead of trusting in what the Lord Jesus has done.

   42, 43. Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of
   heaven; as it is written in the book of the Prophets, O you house of
   Israel, have you offered to Me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space
   of forty years in the wilderness? Yes, you took up the tabernacle of
   Moloch, and the star of your God, Remphan, figures which you made to
   worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. There was still
   idolatry in their hearts and Moses was rejected by them. God grant that
   we may not be idolaters and so reject the Prophet like unto Moses, whom
   the Lord has sent unto us! Amen!

"What Shall the Harvest Be?"

   (No. 2632)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 23, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   14, 1882.

   "For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it has
   no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if it should produce, strangers
   shall swallow it up." Hosea 8:7.

   PRUDENT men look before them to see the result of their actions. Their
   eyes look beyond the present to the future. They look before they leap.
   It is only the foolish man who goes blindly on till, at last, he
   stumbles and has a desperate and probably fatal fall. Brothers and
   Sisters, I hope that I am addressing those who have enough wit and
   wisdom to look at the consequences of what they are doing. This is how
   I wish to live--not merely doing what may give me today's temporary
   pleasure, but asking myself what will be the result of those actions,
   by-and-by. How will they appear to me when I come to be old? What
   aspect will they wear when my eyes are failing me in death? What will
   be the result in that life after death--that endless future which is so
   sure to come to me, let me live as I may? I say that I hope I am
   speaking to those who look a little ahead, and are not, "like dumb
   driven cattle," satisfied if there is grass enough within the reach of
   their mouths, but who look before them to see the consequences on the
   morrow and especially on that Last Great Day for which all other days
   were made--"the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."

   We are all sowing, Brothers--we cannot help it. You Sisters, too, are
   sowing--perhaps but a little garden plot, or possibly a broader acreage
   in public life--but you are all sowing. And every day there is a
   sowing. No man goes forth in the morning without a seed-basket. What
   may be in it is not so easily told. There may be nothing in it but the
   wind. There may be chaff in it. There may be in it curses which shall
   grow up to plague yourself and others, but it is certain that we do not
   move an inch along the furrows of life without scattering some kind of
   seed. He that does least is seeding his idleness and, like the thistle
   that stands still, and offers its downy seed to be carried by every
   wandering wind, so does the sluggard--he does mischiefby doing nothing.

   As we are all sowing, the great question we have to consider is, "what
   will the harvest be?" Every wise man will ask himself that question. I
   may have sown very little in my small plot, or I may have walked far
   and scattered the seed broadcast over the wider field committed to my
   charge--but what have I sown and what shall I reap? What sheaves shall
   I gather into the garner? Sheaves of fire that shall burn into my soul
   forever, or sheaves of glory that I shall bring with rejoicing in the
   Last Great Day? Brothers and Sisters, if it is rightly examined, this
   matter of the harvest from our sowing will be found to be full of very
   rich encouragement to those who are seeking to serve God. If you have
   believed in Christ and received eternal life by faith in Him, and if
   now you are trying to labor for Him, you are sowing blessed seed--and
   if it comes not up today, or tomorrow, yet Divine Grace ensures a crop
   and you shall have precious sheaves which you shall gather in one of
   these days! Therefore, be encouraged to labor on! The farmer waits for
   the precious fruits of the earth through the long and dreary winter,
   through the checkered days of spring, through March winds and April
   showers he waits, until, at last, the golden harvest rewards him for
   all his toil. Labor on, then, Beloved, "steadfast, unmovable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your
   labor is not in vain in the Lord." That which you sow, you shall also
   reap! Your Lord has told you so. Therefore, be not dismayed by the long
   waiting but--

   "Sow and faint not,

   Till the seed a harvest bears."

   But, while this Truth of God is full of encouragement to God's people,
   it ought to be a very strong and powerful check to those who are living
   in sin. As you sow, you will have to reap! Those "wild oats" about
   which you laugh are easily sown, but they will make hard and sorrowful
   reaping! That act of iniquity, that indulgence in lust, that lie, that
   blasphemy, that revolt against God in stifling your conscience and
   refusing to yield to Christ--all these will produce a harvest in due
   season! It is easy to toss these pigeons up into the air, but they will
   all come home to roost. At nightfall you shall see every one of
   them--and they will have grown greater than when you set them flying.
   And they will be bearers of messages of misery to the rash hand that
   sent them flying abroad. It is a dreadful thing to be so living that
   you would not wish the result of your actions to come home to you! And
   if any of you are so living, I pray God, the Holy Spirit, now to give
   me something to say which shall, like a strong hand, lay hold of your
   bridle and compel you to stand still and race no longer in the downward
   course to Hell!

   My text naturally divides itself into two parts and, at first sight,
   they do not seem to be very closely connected. But I think that I shall
   be able to show that they are. From the first part of the text we may
   learn that some sowings will have a horrible harvest "They have sown
   the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind." Then the rest of the text
   will teach us that some sowing must end in failure. They are such poor,
   windy things, that they shall never come to anything that is good. If a
   blade shall come up, yet "it has no stalk." And, if it should seem to
   come to a stalk, "the bud shall yield no meal." It shall be like the
   devil's meal--all bran--there shall be no good flour in it. Or, if it
   should yield meal, "if it should produce, strangers shall swallow it
   up." The old proverb says, "There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the
   lip," and these sowers find it to be so with their sowing! Strangers
   come in and steal away the fruit out of the very mouth that hoped to be
   fed by it so that no good result comes of the sowing as far as he is
   concerned.

   I. The first part of our text teaches us that some sowings will PRODUCE
   A HORRIBLE HARVEST.

   Some have a horrible harvest even in this world, as, for example, the
   sowing of oppression which leads to revolt and revenge. I do not know a
   better instance of this than France. Some two hundred years ago, or
   even less than that, the owners of the land in that country treated the
   peasantry worse than they treated their cattle. Poor and almost naked
   men might have been seen dragging the plow over the soil, themselves,
   because they were reduced to such poverty by excessive rents that they
   could not afford to keep animals to do the hard work. Kings, princes
   and the great ones of the land cared for nothing but their own
   pleasures--and those pleasures were often of the most vicious kind.
   Read the first chapters of Carlyle's French Revolutionand see in what a
   state France was. Yet, for a time, everything seemed to go on favorably
   for the oppressors. If the peasantry revolted, they were put down with
   an iron hand.

   The mighty rulers thought that their empire would never come to an end
   and, as for the Grand Monarch, himself-- was there ever such another
   mortal as he thought himself to be, and as his courtiers spoke of him?
   Might not his kingdom last forever--at least, in the hands of his
   successors? Yet, one after another, those kings and nobles sowed the
   wind and, at the end of the last century, they reaped the whirlwind!
   Having, themselves, defied all law and justice, they had taught the
   people to do the same--and when the masses once rose in rebellion and
   got the upper hand--you know how they worked the terrible guillotine
   and how the streets, not only of Paris, but of many another city and
   town, were deluged with blood! And, at last, the oppressors were made
   to realize that their cruelty and oppression had come home to them.

   It is always so, sooner or later, according to the rule of God's
   righteous government. Men may stretch the cord for a long while, but at
   length it snaps and woe be to those that are holding it when it gives
   way! The people may be, for a time, trodden down beneath the tyrant's
   hoof, but, in the long run, the tyrant gets the worst of it. France has
   more than once furnished an awful instance of the retribution that
   comes upon those who do not regard the dignity of man and who treat him
   as if he were merely a beast, or something worse! They have sown the
   wind and they have reaped the whirlwind.

   Now take another view of the picture presented by our text. We have
   lately had, over in Ireland, a terrible proof that the justification of
   outrage leads to murder. Certain persons say, "We never meant to urge
   our countrymen to commit the crime of murder and we are shocked at the
   Phoenix Park tragedy. We wash our hands in innocence, for we are clear
   of guilt in this matter! We denounce it, we have no part in it, we
   abhor it." So they say, but what led up to that awful deed of blood?
   When men have used expressions in which they have not condemned, but
   have almost justified outrage and murder in other cases, what could
   come of it but that their disciples should go a little beyond what
   their masters may have intended? You cannot scatter fire and then when,
   at last, the city burns, say, "Oh, we never meant it to spread like
   that! We only intended to burn down that cottage, or that wretched
   shanty! We never thought of burning down the city! We are as innocent
   of the crime as newborn babes--we never meant to do anything of the
   kind." Yes, but you cannot say to fire, "Thus far shall you go and no
   further." And in like manner, if you sow the wind, you will reap the
   whirlwind.

   There is a whole province of Holland protected from the sea by a dyke
   and there is a man who wants to let in a little water to the other side
   for a certain purpose. He says he is only going to let a little stream
   run through, so he takes his pickaxe and he worlds away till he has
   made a passage through the dyke. And then, of course, the whole dyke is
   swept away and the province gets drowned! The foolish fellow says, "God
   forbid that I should have the blame of this catastrophe! I never meant
   to do anything of the sort." Of course he did not--he intended
   something far less than that, but his action naturally produced the
   result that followed and, therefore, he is rightly regarded as
   responsible for it! Beware, I pray you, of trifling with the eternal
   principles of justice and of right and wrong! Beware of ever
   sanctioning what you consider to be only a little evil, for, if you do,
   the greater evil is sure to follow at its heels! It is like the boy
   that the burglar takes and pushes through a little window, that he may
   open the door and let in those who commit robbery and murder. So, if
   any of us begin to advocate principles which sap and undermine the
   foundations of law and order, we cannot tell to what mischief our talk
   will lead--it is well for us to always be careful not to sow the wind,
   lest we should, by-and-by, reap the whirlwind!

   Passing from those great instances which prove the rule, I want you,
   next, to notice that there are many persons who fall into this same
   fault. Take, for instance, the teacher of error. He is, perhaps, in
   other respects, an excellent minister, but he is unsound on one
   important point. Just so and, before long, his unsoundness on one point
   will lead to unsoundness all round! It is like a single speck of decay
   in fruit--it is very apt to cause the whole to go rotten. Have you ever
   heard the story which was told by Augustine concerning a young man who
   had been, at one time, a professed Believer in God, but who had given
   up all trust in Him? It occurred to him, when he was very much tried by
   the buzzing and biting of flies, that God could not have created such
   troublesome little creatures. They were such a nuisance to him that he
   concluded that the devil had made them and, having once gone the length
   of believing that the devil made flies, he thought it highly probable
   that Satan created some other nuisances. And he went on till, at last,
   he actually came to believe that the devil made everything--and he did
   not believe in God at all. "Ah!" remarks Augustine, as he relates the
   story, "he that errs about a fly soon errs about all things."

   Look at the progress of Romanism in our own country. When the most of
   us were boys, we used to hear our fathers talking of a Mr. Pusey and of
   baptismal regeneration--and it was thought, then, to be a strange thing
   if a man wore a cross around his neck. All England was stirred about
   the matter and everybody was horrified! But look at the so-called
   "priests" now--they have gone all the length of Rome. "Where?" you ask.
   Well, where are they not? They seem to be everywhere now, swarming over
   the land, and they have brought back rank Popery into what used to be
   called "the Protestant Church of England!" How has that come to pass?
   Well, first of all, there was a little of it tolerated and then a
   little more of it was needed and, gradually, more was sucked down until
   now I believe that many of the Ritualists would be prepared to receive
   the Pope and all his cardinals, red hats and all! I really cannot see
   why they should not, for, if they did, they could scarcely be more
   Popish than they are, already! Only go a little way in the course of
   error and it is like sliding down an inclined plane--there is no
   telling where you will stop. Go to the top of St. Paul's Cathedral and
   throw a stone down from that height. You say that you only mean to
   throw it a yard. Ah, but it will never rest until it gets to the
   ground--and perhaps it will kill someone before it reaches the earth!

   So, when once you start in the way of error, there is no possibility of
   stopping unless Divine Grace shall interpose to save you from the
   consequences of the first false step! You sow the wind and you reap the
   whirlwind. A little error leads to more, and that to still more until
   the very idea of God is given up! I, therefore, love to meet a man who
   is stiff-backed in his orthodoxy and, in this age of laxness and
   looseness, I am prepared to clap my hands even when I see a little
   bigotry! I like a man to believe something--to stick to it, to know
   that it is true and not to be ashamed to avow it in the teeth of his
   fellow men--let them oppose as they will, for there must be
   somethingtrue and, oh, that God's gracious Spirit may teach us what it
   is! And when we once know it, may we hold it fast, come life or come
   death--for if we do not, we shall sow the wind and reap the whirlwind!

   Here is another instance of the same Truth of God--an ill example at
   home. I will confine it to that one point, though it is of general
   application. You probably know a man who is very lax in the management
   of his family. He professes to be a Christian, perhaps, but his sons
   and daughters are allowed to plunge into every frivolity and every
   vanity. Yes, and they may even go into open sin and all that they will
   hear will be some gentle word like that which fell from the lips of
   soft-hearted Eli when he did but hint that his sons were not doing well
   when they were doing much that was terribly evil! The man even hears
   that such-and-such a vice has been committed by his son, yet he
   scarcely upbraids him. He is so easy-tempered that he says nothing,
   though he sorrows within his own heart. Perhaps his own example and the
   example of his wife are not such as could be desired. Family prayer is
   neglected and holy living is not known in the house. He gets
   prematurely old--his son has died very early--he has drunk himself to
   death, or destroyed himself by vice. His daughters, too, are unhappy in
   their marriages. The whole family has virtually gone to ruin as to any
   connection with the Christian Church.

   What shall I say of the old gentleman? He will not say it, himself, but
   I must say it for him--he sowed the wind and he has reaped the
   whirlwind! The father's character is usually seen in his sons. It has
   been said that ministers' sons often turn out badly--if it is so and I
   am not sure that it is--it must be because the ministers have not kept
   their own vineyards, for the rule still holds good, "Train up a child
   in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from
   it." Generally, though not always, if he does depart from it, it is
   because there has been some fatal neglect in his training--and there
   are some Christian parents who are acting thus. They are so indulgent,
   not only to their children, but to themselves, that they do not like to
   give themselves the trouble that ought to be taken in all such cases.
   They are sowing the wind and they will reap the whirlwind!

   Let me give another illustration of the truth of the text with
   reference to persons who fall into evil habits. At first those evil
   habits are under restraint. They admit that they drink, but they say
   that they cannot be called "drunks." They may, now and then, take more
   than is good for them but, still, it is not very often. That is the
   beginning of the evil! And, by-and-by, where are they? They have sown
   the wind and they reap the whirlwind! Did you ever hear the story of
   the Persian prince who dreamed that he was drinking from a cup and a
   fly came and tried to sip from it? He drove it away, but, as he kept on
   drinking from his cup, it came back--and it had grown as large as a
   bird! He drove the creature away, but it returned as large as an
   eagle--the largest kind of bird! He tried to chase that away, but it
   soon came back in the form of a man who grinned at him most horribly.
   He strove to get that man away, but soon he was back in the form of a
   giant who trod on him and crushed him to death! That is just the
   picture of the growth of an evil habit! At first you say, "Is it not a
   little one?" But it grows and increases till it becomes unconquerable.
   That parable illustrates our text--if you sow the wind you will reap
   the whirlwind! You cannot live in sin, you cannot do wrong of any kind,
   or in any form, but it will come back to you, not merely as wind, as
   you sowed it, but as a whirlwind, as a horrible tempest, as a rushing
   tornado, carrying everything before it!

   I will not tarry to give more illustrations of this solemn Truth of God
   because I want to leave a few minutes for the consideration of the
   second part of the subject. Only I pray that God may write on the
   memory and heart of any of you who are living as you should not live,
   the great fact that as surely as you so live, "That which a man sows,
   that shall he also reap." And he will reap even worse than he sows, for
   if he sows the wind he will reap the whirlwind.

   II. Now let us turn to the second part of the subject which is that
   SOME SOWINGS MUST END IN FAILURE.

   There are some people who do not think that they are doing any hurt,
   yet they are living an aimless life. Go to them and ask what they are
   sowing? "Nothing," they answer. They say that they are doing no hurt to
   anybody, for they are not doing anything at all--but is not that kind
   of life an injury to themselves and to others? If you have no aim in
   life, no high ambition, no objective, no noble purpose--does anything
   ever come of it? People talk of what they call, "chance," but I never
   found any chance of a man's getting to be holy without intending to be
   so! I never yet heard of a man doing any great good in the world if he
   did not mean to do it! I never heard of a man glorifying God by
   accident, nor of anyone getting to Heaven, as it were, by the throw of
   the dice, somehow finding himself there, but not knowing how it all
   happened. No, if you lead an aimless life, what will come of it will be
   just what the text says--"It has no stalk" There will be no plant from
   it and even if there should be some kind of stalk to the seed that you
   have sown, yet when it springs up, "there shall be no meal." It cannot
   be any comfort to you, even if things should go pretty well without
   your intending that they should, for the comfort, after all, lies in
   the motive and in the intention. And even if your life should somehow
   turn out to be better than that of other aimless persons, though you
   never intended it to be so, "if it should produce, the strangers shall
   swallow it up." If you meant it to be nothing, it will be nothing.

   I daresay that I am speaking to a large number of people who do not
   know what they are living for. You have come into the world and here
   you are and, in due time, you will go out of it--but that is all that
   can be said of you. You are doing nothing. You have no noble end in
   view, no glorious purpose to accomplish, no sublime aspiration to
   realize. Then take it for granted that if all you sow is the wind, you
   will reap nothing but wind--only it will come to you in a fiercer
   form--as a whirlwind, for God will say to you, "I made you for My
   Glory. I sent you into the world with a purpose. I entrusted you with
   talents. I made you a steward of My goods and now you are accused of
   having wasted My goods. Give an account of your stewardship." What will
   you say? Alas, in that day the trifler, the idler, the mere butterfly
   in the garden of the world will find things going hard, indeed, with
   him! God save you all from leading an aimless life!

   But there are some who are sowing the wind in another form. They are
   leading a selfish life. Self is the beginning and the end of their
   life. They open a shop simply to make money. They live at home to be
   comfortable. Perhaps they enlarge themselves a little by taking the
   wife and the children into the circle of self, but still, that is
   all--they have no care for God, no love for Christ, no wish to help the
   poor, no thought about eternity. That is a life of sowing the wind and
   it will end, sooner or later, in reaping the whirlwind, for no man
   lives unto himself without earning for himself a fearful reward!
   Selfishness is often like the serpent that stings itself to death. It
   is not possible, within the compass of a man's own soul, that he should
   satisfy the cravings and desires of that soul. When he loves God and
   loves his neighbor--he is really most of all blessing himself--for then
   is he living to true purpose.

   But when self is everything to a man, he confines his soul within the
   morgue of his own ribs--his spirit dies within him and becomes like a
   stone. In the case of the man who lives only for self, it may be said
   of his life, in the words of the text, "It has no stalk: the bud shall
   yield no meal." He gathers riches, but has no happiness or contentment
   in them. He is like Solomon, who, with all his possessions, had to cry,
   "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" Or if he gets to be rich and seems
   to enjoy himself a little, he suddenly dies and strangers swallow up
   his estate! All that is left of him is a massive tomb and the notice in
   the newspapers that he died worth so many thousands of pounds--which is
   not true, for he never was really worth a farthing all his life! He was
   a worthless man whose only value consisted in the money he possessed.

   O my dear Hearers, I implore you, with all my soul, not to live unto
   yourselves! If you desire the highest, grandest selfishness that can
   ever be attained, I charge you, throw selfishness away, remembering our
   Savior's Words, "He that loses his life for My sake, shall find it." He
   who casts his life away for the sake of Christ and for love of the
   Truth of God, shall be the man who shall really save his life and find
   true joy and blessedness! But for anyone to live for self is to sow the
   wind and to reap the whirlwind.

   So, once again, will it be if a man lives a self-righteous life. A
   self-righteous man is generally very great at sowing-- so many
   prayers--so many almsgivings--so many sermons--so many ceremonies. Yes,
   wind, wind, wind! He is sowing wind, but what will come of it all? This
   very good religious man--I forget whether his name is Good Enough, or
   Too-Good, but I believe the families are cousins--is, in his own
   opinion, so very excellent that he does all he ought to do and perhaps
   a little more. Yet he is only sowing the wind! And what will he reap
   from it? Well, if God is very gracious to him, he will soon reap the
   whirlwind, for he will find, to his confusion, that all his
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags and they shall be like the sere
   leaves of the forest borne away by the wind! I pray that he may, in
   this sense, reap the whirlwind very soon, for, if not, he will do so in
   the next world when all his pretended good works and all his formal
   observances of external religion will be nothing but so much whirlwind
   to blow in his face, and to fan the flames of Hell forever! O dear
   Friends, shun self-righteousness and trust, alone, to the righteousness
   of Christ! May the Spirit of God lead you to wash in the atoning blood
   and then cover you with the spotless righteousness of Jesus Christ!
   Then it will be well with your soul--but all self-righteousness shall
   end in delusion and confusion forever and ever. May God grant that none
   of us may, in this sense, sow the wind!

   The text is pre-eminently true of every man who leads a deceitful life.
   Oh, have I the misery of speaking to one who makes a profession of
   religion and who wishes to be thought to be a Christian, but yet is not
   really so? It is hard for a true Believer to maintain a Christian
   character, but it is very much harder to keep up that character when
   there is nothing at the back of it! Oh, how desperately does the man
   who is a hypocrite have to labor! He has to patch up here, and patch up
   there--daub with untempered mortar here, and whitewash there, and he
   never has any peace. And all the while he is only sowing the wind!
   There is nothing real in his religion--what will come of it when that
   hypocrisy is discovered, when he stands revealed before the bar of God?
   Will his hypocritical religion do him any good? No, "it has no stalk"
   even now! It cannot yield him even present comfort! If there is a "bud"
   that looks a little like self-respect, it "shall yield no meal." I have
   already quoted the old proverb, "The devil's meal is all bran," and I
   may add that the hypocrite's meal is all bran. There is nothing
   substantial in it. And even if he should seem to die in the odor of
   sanctity, yet the stranger shall come in and devour his supposed
   religiousness, for somebody shall tell the truth about him and so his
   fine reputation shall be utterly blasted.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, I have come to the end of this discourse.
   And what should be the practical result of it but that if we have been
   sowing anything that we ought not to sow, we should pray God to come
   and plow it all up! Lord, drive the plow straight through every life
   that is not according to Your Word! Oh, to have all the evil
   obliterated-- every seed of sin crushed and destroyed! Would God that
   it might be so with all of us!

   What next? Well, let us then go--oh, may the Divine Spirit lead us!--to
   Jesus Christ and ask Him to give us the good seed! Let us have our
   hands washed from the evil in which we formerly delighted and He,
   alone, can cleanse us. Then let us take the clean good wheat which He
   will give us out of His own granary and let us go and sow it. God help
   us to sow it right and left, from morn to eve, without weariness, that,
   at the last, we may gather in a glorious harvest, not to our own glory,
   but to the praise of Him by whose rich, Free and Sovereign Grace we
   were enabled to sow to the Spirit, and of the Spirit to reap life
   everlasting! Amen.

   Before we go, we will sing that very solemn hymn in Mr. Sankey's book,
   "What Shall the Harvest Be?" It will help to impress the subject upon
   our memories and hearts--

   "Sowing the seed by the dawn-light fair,

   Sowing the seed by the noon-day glare.

   Sowing the seed by the fading light,

   Sowing the seed in the solemn night--

   Oh, what shall the harvest be?

   Sowing the seed with an aching heart,

   Sowing the seed while the teardrops start,

   Sowing in hope till the reapers come,

   Gladly to gather the harvest home--

   Oh, what shall the harvest be?

   Sown in the darkness, or sown in the light,

   Sown in our weakness, or sown in our might,

   Gathered in time, or eternity,

   Sure, ah, sure, will the harvest be!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GALATIANS 5:13-26; GALATIANS 6:1-10.

   Remember, beloved Brothers and Sisters, that the Epistle to the
   Galatians is one in which Paul, with especial clearness, proves the
   Doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone. So much is this the case that
   the famous Commentary of Martin Luther upon this Epistle is, perhaps,
   the strongest work extant upon the Doctrine of salvation by Grace
   through faith. But that doctrine was never intended to be separated
   from the Scriptural teaching concerning the fruit of faith, namely,
   good works and, therefore, we find, in the close of this very Epistle,
   the strongest possible declaration that if men live in sin, they will
   reap the result of sin--and that only if, by Grace, they are brought to
   walk in holiness, will they win the rewards of Grace.

   Galatians 5:13. For, brethren, you have been called unto liberty; only
   use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. "Do not make license out
   of your liberty. Remember that liberty fromsin is not liberty tosin."

   13, 14. But by love serve one another For all the Law is fulfilled in
   one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself The
   condensation of the whole Law of God is contained in that one word,
   "love." In the First Table we are taught to love God. And the
   Commandments of the Second Table teach us to love our neighbor.

   15. But if you bite and devour one another. Finding fault, slandering,
   injuring, bearing malice and so on--"If you bite and devour one
   another."

   15. Take heed that you are not consumed, one of another. ' 'You will
   eat one another up. You will, each one, condemn his neighbor." Paul
   represents the great Judge coming and waiting outside the door. And
   when He hears two men condemning one another, He says to Himself, "I
   will confirm their verdict. They have mutually condemned each other, I
   will say 'Amen' to it." What a sad thing it is if professed Christians
   are found thus condemning one another!

   16. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the
   lusts of the flesh. Walk under the Spirit's power, following His
   guidance. The Spirit never leads a man into sin. He never conducts him
   into self-indulgence and excess.

   17. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
   flesh: and these are contrary, the one to the other, so that you cannot
   do the things that you would. How often that is the case! You would be
   perfect, but, "you cannot do the things that you would." We would, if
   possible, escape from every evil thought--we would not even hear of
   anything sinful if we could help it.

   18. 19. But ifyou are led ofthe Spirit, you are not under the Law. Now
   the works ofthe flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery,
   fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness. Any kind of sensual
   indulgence--whatever it may be--a lustful glance, the cherishing of an
   unclean desire--the utterance of a foul expression--all this is
   condemned, as well as the overt acts of adultery and fornication.

   20. 21. Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
   strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness. Is
   drunkenness actually put by the Apostle afermurder, as though it were
   something worse than that terrible crime? Or is it not, oftentimes, the
   case that drunkenness lies at the bottom of the murder?

   21. Reveling and such like: ofthe which I told you before, as I have
   also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not
   inherit the Kingdom of God. Paul never said, nor ever thought of
   saying, that a man might live in sin that Grace might abound. No,
   no--these evil things must be given up! Christ has come to save us from
   every evil work. And this is the salvation that we preach--not simply
   salvation from Hell, but salvation from sin--which is the very fire
   that has kindled the infernal flame. But how different from all this
   evil is the fruit of the Spirit!

   22. But the fruit ofthe Spirit is love. Universal love, first, to God.
   Next, to His people and, then, to all mankind. Have we that fruit of
   the Spirit? If so, it will make us of a very amiable disposition. It
   will dethrone selfishness and set up holy affections within our heart.

   22. 23. Joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   meekness, temperance. Joy and peace seem to blossom and ripen out of
   love. Long-suffering, too, is part of the fruit of the Spirit. You will
   be hourly tried, but the Spirit of God will give you patience to suffer
   long and to endure much. You will also have gentleness. Some people are
   very hard, stern, severe, quick-tempered, passionate--but the true
   follower of Christ will be gentle and tender, even as He was.

   23. Against such there is no law. Neither God nor man has ever made a
   law against these things--the more there is of them, the better will it
   be for everybody. Oh, that they prevailed all over the world!

   24. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
   affections and lusts. A crucified Christ is the leader of a crucified
   people! Oh, to have all the affections and lusts of the flesh nailed
   up! They may not be actually dead, for those who are crucified may
   still live on for some hours, but they are doomed to die. Their life is
   a very painful one and it is hastening to a close. A man who is
   crucified cannot get down from the cross to do what he wills and, oh,
   it is a great blessing to have our sinful self thus nailed up! Ah, Sir,
   you may struggle, but you cannot get down! You may strive and cry, but
   your hands and feet are nailed--you cannot go into active, actual sin.
   The Lord grant that the nails may hold very fast, that none of the
   struggling of our old nature may be able to pull out those nails that
   have fastened it up to the cross!

   25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit If that is
   our real life, let it also be our course of action.

   26. Let us not be desirous of vain-glory. Do not let us want to be
   accounted as somebody, for, if we do, we prove that we are really
   nobody! Nobody is anybody till he is willing to be nobody--as long as
   he wants to be somebody, he is nobody and nothing!

   26. Provoking one another, envying one another God save us from that
   and every other form of evil!

   Galatians 6:1. Brethren, if a man is overtaken in a fault. He is a slow
   traveler. He is not speeding swiftly on the way to Heaven, so the fault
   overtakes him. Had he been quicker of pace, he might have outstripped
   it, but he is "overtaken in a fault." What then? Throw him out of the
   Church? Have done with him? No. "If a man is overtaken in a fault"--

   1. You which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of
   meekness. Pick him up, help him to run better than he did before.

   1. Considering yourself, lest you, also, are tempted. Paul does not
   say, "Lest you also fall," but, "Lest you, also, are tempted"--as much
   as to say, "You will be sure to fall if you are tempted," and that man
   who thinks that other people ought to be cast off because they have
   committed a fault is so proud in his own heart that he only needs to be
   tempted and he would fall, too! This is a very expressive way of
   putting the matter! "Considering yourself, lest you also be tempted."

   2. Bear you one another's burdens and so fulfill the Law of Christ Help
   your Brothers and Sisters. If you see that they have more to do than
   they can accomplish, take a share of their labor. If they have a
   heavier burden than they can bear, try to put your shoulder beneath
   their load and so lighten it for them.

   3. For if a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
   deceives himself Paul does not say, "He deceives other people." No, "he
   deceives himself" As a general rule, other people find him out, they
   learn what he really is, but, "he deceives himself."

   4. 5. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
   rejoicing in himself, alone, and not in another For every man shall
   bear his own burden. There is, after all, a burden which we cannot
   carry for others and which we cannot shift upon others. There are
   burdens of care, sorrow and trouble which we can take from other men's
   shoulders, but the great burden of responsibility before God, each man
   must carry for himself.

   6. Let him that is taught in the Word communicate unto him that teaches
   in all good things. Those who are taught and so receive spiritual
   things, should maintain those who are their teachers as far as they are
   able to do so.

   7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that
   shall he also reap. That is true under the Gospel as well as under the
   Law.

   8. For he that sows to his flesh shall ofthe flesh reap corruption.
   That is what always comes to the flesh--it decays and corrupts.

   8. But he that sows to the Spirit shall ofthe Spirit reap life
   everlasting. No corruption shall come to that which belongs to the
   Spirit! "He that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
   everlasting."

   9, 10. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
   shall reap if we faint not As we have therefore opportunity, let us do
   good unto all men, especially unto them who are ofthe household of
   faith.

The Two Pivots

   (No. 2633)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 30 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 18,
   1882.

   "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob." Exodus 3:6.

   "Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He has
   prepared a city for them."

   Hebrews 11:16.

   YOU remember, dear Friends, that Paul is writing to the Hebrews
   concerning Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and he says, "God is not ashamed
   to be called their God." Then, when you turn back to our text in
   Exodus, you find that God was called their God at the burning bush and,
   oftentimes, on other occasions, He is called the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. We must not forget that at the time
   when God appeared to Moses, in the desert, in the bush that burned, but
   was not consumed, the condition of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac
   and Jacob was very terrible. They were slaves to the Egyptians. They
   were an oppressed and downtrodden race. Their male children were taken
   from them and cast into the river. They were entirely in Pharaoh's
   hands. They were a degraded people, as all slaves gradually become, and
   they were unable, of themselves, to rise out of that degradation. Yet,
   at that very time, God was not ashamed to be called their God! There,
   with Israel in bondage, Jehovah, whose name is the great I AM--a name
   which makes all Heaven bright with ineffable Glory--did not disdain to
   say to Moses, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of
   Jacob." I do not wonder that the Apostle should note it as a remarkable
   thing, that He was not ashamed to be called their God!

   I have been looking into this text very earnestly and trying to find
   out exactly what was the meaning of the Holy Spirit in it, and I think
   I have discovered a clue in two words which it contains. First,
   "Therefore." "Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God"--and
   next, "for." "For He has prepared for them a city." As a door hangs
   upon two hinges, so my golden text turns upon these two
   pivots--"therefore" and, "for."

   I. I shall ask you to keep your Bibles open at the 11th of Hebrews,
   that you may see, first, "THEREFORE." Therefore God is not ashamed to
   be called the God of His people. Look at the 18th verse--"These all
   died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
   afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed
   that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth" and so on.
   "Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God."

   To begin with, then, the Lord was not ashamed to be called His people's
   God because they had faith in Him. You read here of Abraham, Sarah,
   Isaac, Jacob--and then Paul says, "These all died in faith." If a man
   believes in God, trusts Him--believes that His promise is true and that
   He will keep it--believes that God's command is right and, therefore,
   ought to be obeyed--God is never ashamed to be called that man's God.
   He is not the God of unbelievers, for they act contrary to His will.
   They set up their own will in opposition to His--many of them even
   doubt His existence, they deny His power, they distrust His love--and,
   therefore, He is notcalled their God. But when a man comes to trust God
   and to accept His Word, from that moment God sees in that man the works
   of His Grace which are very precious in His eyes, and He is not ashamed
   to be called that man's God.

   Notice that it is said, "These all died in faith," so that they did not
   believe in God for a little while and then become unbelievers, but,
   throughout the whole of their lives, from the moment when they were
   called by God's Grace, they continued to believe Him--they trusted Him
   till they came to their graves--so that this epitaph is written over
   the mausoleum where they all lie asleep, "These all died in faith." Ah,
   my beloved Brothers and Sisters, it is very easy to say, "I believe,"
   and to get very enthusiastic over the notion that we have believed. But
   so to believe as to persevere to the end-- thsis the faith which will
   save the soul! "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
   saved." The faith that many waters cannot drown and the fiercest fires
   cannot burn--the faith that plods on throughout a long and weary
   life--the faith that labors on, doing whatever service God appoints it.
   The faith that waits patiently, expecting the time when every promise
   of God shall be fulfilled to the letter when its hour has come--that is
   the faith which, if it is in a man, makes him such a man that God is
   not ashamed to be called his God! I put it to every one of you, have
   you a faith that will hold on and hold out--not a faith that starts
   with a fine spurt, but a faith that runs from the starting place to the
   goal? Some of you, I know, have believed in God these twenty, thirty,
   forty, or even fifty years. Just before I came to this service, I stood
   by the bedside of a dear Brother who is the nearest to Job of any man I
   ever saw, for he is covered from head to foot with blisters--I might
   almost say, "wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores"--and yet he is
   as happy as anyone among us, joyful and cheerful as he talks about the
   time when he shall be "with Christ, which is far better."

   Oh, that is the faith we want! "These all died in faith," "therefore
   God is not ashamed to be called their God." He is not the God of
   apostates, for He has said, "If any man draws back, My soul shall have
   no pleasure in him." If he has put his hand to the plow and looks back,
   he is not worthy of the Kingdom of God. It is the man who steadily and
   persever-ingly, resting in his God and believing Him against all that
   may be said by God's foes, holds on until he sees the King in His
   beauty in the land which is very far off. Of such a man it may be truly
   said that God is not ashamed to be called his

   God!

   Now let us come back to the Scripture. We cannot do better than keep
   close to it, for our text is only to be understood by the context.
   Scripture is the best interpreter of Scripture. The locks of Scripture
   are only to be opened with the keys of Scripture! There is no lock in
   the whole Bible which God meant us to open without a key to fit it
   somewhere in the Bible--and we are to search for it until we find it.
   Now read on in the 18th verse, "These all died in faith, not having
   received the promises." That is to say, the things that God promised to
   them, He did not give them in their mortal life, and they did not
   always expect that He would do so. They were a waiting people. God
   loves those who are like Himself. I am not now speaking of His love of
   benevolence, for with that love He loved us even when we were dead in
   trespasses and sins, but I am speaking of the love of complacency which
   makes Him not ashamed to be called our God. In that sense, God loves
   those who are like Himself--and God is a waiting God--He is never in a
   hurry. How wondrous is the leisure of the Eternal!

   When He is coming to help His people, He is quick, indeed! "He rode
   upon a cherub, and did fly, yes, He did fly upon the wings of the
   wind." But, oftentimes, He waits and tarries till some men count it
   slackness. But He does not reckon time as we do. With God, a day is as
   a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. So, being a waiting
   God, He loves a waiting people. He loves a man who can take the promise
   and say, "I believe it. It may never be fulfilled to me in this life,
   but I do not need that it should be. I am perfectly willing that it
   should be fulfilled when God intends that it should be." Abraham saw
   Christ's day afar off, but he never saw Christ--yet he rejoiced in the
   promise of which he did not receive the fulfillment! Isaac did not see
   Christ except in a vision of the things that were long afterwards to
   come to pass. Jacob did not hear that joyful sound, which--

   "Kings and Prophets waited for, And sought, but never found." But they
   were perfectly willing to wait and God was not ashamed to be called the
   God of such a waiting people!

   You remember Mr. Bunyan's description of the two children, Passion and
   Patience? Passion would have his best things now, and he had them. But
   he soon spoiled them, misused them and abused them. But Patience would
   have his best things last and, as Bunyan very prettily says, "There is
   nothing to come after the last." Therefore, when Patience got his best
   things, they lasted on forever and forever. God, loves not the passion,
   but He loves the patience. "The husbandman waits for the precious fruit
   of the earth and has long patience for it." And I would gladly imitate
   him. "My Soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is from Him." The
   worldly man lives in the present, but that is a poor way of living,
   worthy only of the beasts that perish.

   Look on the sheep and bullocks in the pasture--what kind of life is
   theirs? They also live in the present. If they have grass enough for
   today, they are perfectly satisfied. The butcher's knife has no terrors
   for them and neither do they, in the cold of winter, look forward to
   the bright days of summer. They cannot look before them and God loves
   not men who are like the beasts of the field! He is ashamed to be
   called their God. But He loves the man who gets to live in eternity,
   for God Himself lives there! To God there is no past, present, or
   future--He sees all at a single glance. And when a man comes to feel
   that he is not living simply in today which will so soon end, but that
   he is living in the eternity which will never end. When he is rejoicing
   in the Covenant, "ordered in all things, and sure," made from before
   the foundation of the world--when a man feels that he is living in the
   future as well as the present, that his vast estates are on the other
   side of Jordan, that his chief joy is up there where Christ sits at the
   right hand of God, and that his own heart has gone up there where his
   treasure is, for "where your treasure is, there will your heart be
   also"--when the affection is set, not upon things below, but upon
   things above--that is the man whom God loves because he has learned how
   to live in God's atmosphere, in God's own eternity! He has risen above
   the beggarly elements of time and space. He is not circumscribed by
   Almanacs, days, months and years--his thoughts range right away from
   that glorious declaration, "I have loved you with an everlasting love,"
   to those endless, dateless periods when the everlasting love of God
   will still be the constant delight of His people!

   I see, then, why it is written that "God, is not ashamed to be called
   their God," because they are content to live without having received
   the promises, but to keep on patiently waiting with a holy, joyful
   confidence, till the hour of God's gracious purpose shall arrive and
   the promise shall be fulfilled.

   Now read on in the 18th verse, and see whether this description fits
   yourself, dear Friend. "But having seen them afar off." So they were a
   far-seeing people. God, you know, sees everything. And He loves people
   who can see afar off. The gods of the heathen have eyes, but they see
   not. And the Psalmist says, "They that make them are like unto them."
   So they that worship a blind god are a blind people! But they that
   worship a seeing God are, themselves, made to see, for they are
   numbered with the pure in heart who shall see God! It is a grand thing
   when a man can see infinitely further than these poor eyes can carry,
   far beyond the range of the strongest telescope, when he can see beyond
   death--and see beyond the Judgment Seat and see right into Heaven and
   there behold the Lamb leading His glorified flock to the living
   fountains of waters, and the saints, with tearless eyes, forever bowing
   before the Throne of God and the Lamb! God is not ashamed to be called
   the God of the people who can do this! God is ashamed to be called the
   God of you blind people, whose eyes have never been opened. But when He
   opens your eyes, then He becomes your God and He is not ashamed to be
   so called, for He it is that gives us this blessed power to see! Until
   spiritual sight is thus bestowed upon us, we are blind. But when God
   has given us sight, then He is not ashamed to acknowledge us as His
   children, nor is He ashamed to acknowledge that He, Himself, is our
   God!

   I appeal to you whom I am now addressing and ask whether you can see
   God's promises afar off? There are some who say, "A bird in the hand is
   worth two in the bush." Yes, it may be so with the poor birds that sing
   here, but, for my part, I am willing to wait till I can have the one in
   the bush if it is in the bush that burned with fire because God was
   there! You may have the bird in the hand, if you will. You will soon
   pluck off its feathers, it will speedily die in your hand and there
   will come an end to it. But there are other birds which, as yet, we
   cannot reach, but which are really ours, and if we cannot at present
   grasp them, we are willing to wait God's time--because we can see that
   they will be in our hands in the future, we can already see them "afar
   off." Unhappy is the man who sees nothing but what he calls, "the main
   chance," or who sees nothing but that which is within a few feet of
   him. Wretched, indeed, is he who lives only to get money, or to gain
   honor--whose whole life is spent in the pursuit of personal comfort,
   but who never had his eyes opened enough to see the eternal things, and
   who never was able to set a value upon anything but what could be paid
   for with pounds, shillings and pence. Beloved, have you seen the
   promises afar off? Has the Lord opened your eyes to see eternal things?
   Then it is written concerning you, also, "Therefore God is not ashamed
   to be called their God."

   Now pass on to the next sentence, for every word is fruitful with
   meaning--"and were persuaded of them, and embraced them." They were
   people who rejoiced in things unseen. You will find that, in the
   Revised Version, the words, "persuaded of them," are left out, and very
   properly so, for there is no doubt whatever that they were not in the
   original, but were added by somebody who wished to explain the meaning
   to us. The Greek is properly rendered, "but having seen them afar off,
   greeted them," but I like, even better, the translation, "embraced
   them." It means that as for the things which are promised to us, if we
   are Believers, like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, we have, from afar, seen
   those promised things and we have welcomed them. Or, to use our
   Authorized Version, we have "embraced them." We have pressed them to
   our bosom, we have hugged them to our heart, we have loved them in our
   very soul, we have rejoiced in them! They have filled our spiritual
   nature full of music and all the bells of our being are ringing merry
   peals because of the blessed promises of our God. Now, when a man is of
   that mind, God is not ashamed to be called his God!

   Let me ask you then, dear Friend--What is it that you are embracing? Is
   it some earthly thing? Does your heart love and cling to that which you
   can see, and touch and handle? Is that your chief delight? Then God is
   ashamed to be called your God because you are an idolater! You are
   worshipping some created thing. But if you can say of Christ, "He is
   all my salvation and all my desire," then God is not ashamed to be
   called your God. Remember what David said--"Delight yourself also in
   the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart," for God is
   able to give to a man his desires when all his heart is delighting in
   his God--and God is not ashamed to be called his God. The Lord's love
   is not set upon merely material objects. The infinite heart of God
   loves truth, righteousness, purity and everything that is holy and
   glorious. And if your heart does the same, God is not ashamed to be
   called your God. But if you do not love these things, you have neither
   part nor lot in God--you are a stranger to Him and, though I speak this
   solemn Truth of God in gentle language, I pray that it may drop like
   lye upon your spirit and burn its way into your very soul! What an
   awful thing it must be to be without God--to have no part nor lot in
   Him--never to be able to say, "My God, my Father," but only to speak of
   Him as a God--an unknown God, another man's God, but no God to you! May
   it not be so with you, my Friends! If you can say that you have seen
   the promises from afar and have, by faith, embraced them, then God is
   not ashamed to be called your God.

   Pass on to the next sentence--"and confessed that they were strangers
   and pilgrims on the earth." They acknowledged that they were not at
   home here. Abraham never built a house! Isaac never lived anywhere but
   in a tent and, though Jacob tried to dwell in a settled habitation, he
   got into trouble through it and he was bound, still, to be a
   tent-dweller. The reason why they lived in tents was because they
   wanted to show to all around them that they did not belong to that
   country. There were great cities with walls which, as men said, reached
   to Heaven, but they did not go to dwell in those cities. You remember
   that Lot did, yet he was glad enough to get out again--"saved, yet so
   as by fire." But Abraham, Isaac and Jacob kept away from other men, for
   they were commanded to dwell alone and not to be numbered among the
   nations. Nor were they--they kept themselves apart from other people as
   strangers and sojourners here below, so, for that very reason, God is
   not ashamed to be called their God!

   Remember how David said to the Lord, "I am a stranger with You, and a
   sojourner, as all my fathers were." That is a very amazing
   expression--"a stranger with You"--blessed be God, not "a stranger to
   You," but, "a stranger with You." That is to say, God is a stranger
   here--it is His own world and He made it, but when Christ, who is the
   Son of God, and the Creator of the world, came into it, "He came unto
   His own, and His own received Him not." And they soon made Him feel
   that the only treatment which He would receive at their hands was
   this--"This is the Heir. Come, let us kill Him, that the inheritance
   may be ours." There was no man who ever lived who was a truer Man than
   was Christ the Lord. But there was never a Man who was more unlike the
   rest of men. He was a homely Man, a home-loving Man to the last degree,
   yet He was never at home. This world was not His rest. He had nowhere
   to lay His head and what was true, naturally, was also true
   spiritually. This world offered Christ no rest whatever.

   Now, dear Friends, how is it with us? Do we belong to this world, or to
   the unseen? How do you feel about this matter? Do you feel at home
   here? I think that we are often compelled to cry with the Psalmist,
   "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of
   Kedar!" We wish to do good to others as far as we can. We are men of
   peace, but when we speak, they are for war and we realize the truth of
   our Lord's words, "A man's foes shall be they of his own household."
   The more a man comes right straight out for God, the more opposition he
   is sure to meet with! Be half-asleep and nobody will say much against
   you. But wake up and be active for God and for His Christ and you will
   soon discover that the seed of the serpent still has the serpent's
   venom in it--and it hates the Seed of the woman as much as it ever did!
   It must be so and, therefore, always feel that you are only a stranger
   here and that your business is to go through this world as a traveler
   passes through a foreign country. He does not speak the language of the
   people. He does not follow their customs. He is not one of the citizens
   of the land. He is just a temporary dweller here below and he is on his
   journey home. If that is the kind of man you are, God is not ashamed to
   be called your God.

   But He is not the God of the earthworms that only want to burrow down
   into the soil. He is not the God of those who build their nests and
   say, "Here would we live forever." He is not the God of the man who can
   say, "Give me a knife and fork, and plenty to eat and drink. Give me
   suitable clothes to wear in the day and a nice soft bed to sleep on at
   night. Give me wealth, give me fame--that is all I need--and I will let
   Heaven go to anyone who wants it!" Jehovah is not the God of Esau, who
   sells his birthright for a mess of pottage, but He is the God of
   Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob who have a heritage that they cannot
   see, and who count the land in which they dwell to be a place of
   strangers and of sojourners--and they think of themselves as only
   strangers and sojourners in it.

   Now read on a little further. "For they that say such things declare
   plainly that they seek a country." The word translated, "country,"
   might, I think be better rendered, "fatherland." "They who say that
   they are strangers here declare plainly that they seek a fatherland."
   The word is sometimes translated, "their own country." "A Prophet is
   not without honor, save in his own country." It is the same word here
   in the Greek. It signifies that they sought their own country--their
   fatherland. Therefore God, who is the Father of all His people, and
   whose Heaven is their fatherland, is not ashamed to be called their
   God. Now, dear Friends, are you seeking a fatherland? I put the
   question to every hearer here--Are you looking for a fatherland? Sir
   Walter Scott wrote--

   "Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,

   Who never to himself has said,

   'This is my own, my native land'?

   Whose heart has ne'er within him burned,

   As home his footsteps he has turned

   From wandering on a foreign strand?" So said the patriot poet and we
   have said it, too, for we are patriots! But yet I venture to say that
   this is not my home, this is not my fatherland--

   "I'm but a stranger here! Heaven is my home."

   My fatherland lies out of sight, beyond the everlasting hills, where
   God dwells and where Christ sits at the right hand of the Father. Now,
   the men who, by Grace, have been brought to say this, "We are out of
   our own country, we are seeking a fatherland," these are the people of
   whom it is written, "Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their
   God."

   Paul goes on to say, "And truly, if they had been mindful of that
   country from where they came, they might have had opportunity to have
   returned." Brothers and Sisters, this is another characteristic of
   Believers--we have left the world as our home, and joy, and comfort, to
   seek a better country, but we may go back if we like. There is no
   compulsion to keep a man a Christian but the compulsion of love. He who
   is enlisted in the army of Christ may desert if he pleases, but the
   blessed Grace of God will hold us so that we shall do no such thing! We
   have plenty of opportunities to return. Oh, how many invite us to turn
   back! I know how they beckon some of you who have lately come out on
   the Lord's side. Sometimes it is a female voice that would charm you
   and there is a great fascination about it, and you have to mind what
   you are doing lest you become unequally yoked together. Sometimes it is
   the voice of the world promising you wealth-- offering you a better
   situation, perhaps, if you will go back. But, like Moses, you esteem
   "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt."
   You have plenty of opportunities to return. There are back entrances to
   Satan's Kingdom--he does not require you to come in at the front
   door--he lets you sneak in, again, by the back gate. If you want to go
   into slavery, again, there are many opportunities of returning! But if
   you are made by Christ to be, in this respect, like God, immutable, so
   that you say, "I cannot turn. I cannot change. I must be what Christ
   has made me. I must stand fast for truth and for holiness, and stand
   fast as long as I live, so help me, my God"--if you are able to talk
   like that, then God is not ashamed to be called your God! Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob, you can get back to the old country whenever you like.
   But they never will go back--the deep dividing river rolls between them
   and that land, even as, today, there rolls between some of us and the
   world the stream in which we have been buried with Christ and, by God's
   Grace, we shall never cross it again! And, because of that holy
   determination, God is not ashamed to be called our God.

   I finish up my remarks upon the word, "therefore," which is very full
   of matter, by noticing how the Apostle says, "But now they desire a
   better country, that is, a heavenly." That is to say, instead ofgoing
   back, we arepressing forward towards heavenly things. "God is a Spirit
   and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."
   "The Father seeks such to worship Him." That is, those who are
   spiritual, who are seeking after heavenly things with all their heart.
   These are they whom God loves, for God is spiritual. God is heavenly
   and when He has made us spiritual and made us pant after heavenly
   things, then He is not ashamed to be called our God.

   I have put these points before you as briefly as I could, wishing every
   moment to be examining myself, and asking you to examine yourselves.
   Have you a life within you which makes you pant and pine after heavenly
   things? Whatever you have in this world, do you hold it with a loose
   hand? Do you feel that it is not your real riches--it is not your true
   treasure? You know that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were all rich men. God
   blessed them and gave them a great increase to all that they had, but,
   still, they did not live simply to gather riches! They did not make
   that their chief delight. If you had asked them, they would have told
   you that they were inheritors of a mysterious Covenant by which God had
   bound Himself to be their God, and the God of their seed. And in that
   Covenant was included the promise that Christ Himself should come out
   of their loins--and for Him they waited--He was the hope of their
   spirit. Now, dear Friends, if that is the case with you, also, you can
   understand the meaning of my text, "Therefore God is not ashamed to be
   called their God."

   II. I must give but a few minutes to the second part of the text, yet
   it needs a good deal of thought, for it says, "for He has prepared a
   city for them." The second pivot word is, "for."

   Now go back again to the text in Exodus, "I am the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Yet Paul says, "These all died,"
   and we know that our Lord said to the Sadducees, "God is not the God of
   the dead, but of the living." Is He not ashamed to be called the God of
   Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, seeing that they all died? No, because
   they are not dead, though they died, "for He has prepared for them a
   city." These men, though they lived and died, and passed out of the
   world without having received the heritage, are not dead/There is the
   glory of the matter. When they lay a-dying, the devil might have come
   and said to them, "Now, what have you got by your Covenant with God?
   You left father, mother and everything that you had, and went and lived
   the separated life--and now you are dying out here--what have you got?
   Nothing but some little holes in the Cave of Machpelah into which they
   will push your bodies! That is all that you have!"

   Oh, but the devil does not know! Or if he does, he is a liar, for they
   gained everythingby that life of faith, for they still live and God has
   prepared a city for them. And now they have entered that city! Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob are at the very head of the celestial company, for our
   Lord said, "Many shall come from the east, and west, and shall sit down
   with Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven." And,
   by-and-by, Machpelah shall yield up her dead and Abraham, Sarah, Isaac
   and Jacob shall live, again, in the fullest sense, for their bodies as
   well as their souls shall live again! And Joseph's bones, which he
   would not allow to lie in Egypt--for he would not let the Egyptians
   have a scrap of him--shall live, and thus, in their flesh, shall they
   see God and shall rejoice before Him. Therefore God is not ashamed to
   be called the God of these people who all died in faith because they
   are still living--and they shall continue to live forever and ever!

   Somebody may, perhaps, say that these people did not receive the
   promises. Well, they did not literallyreceive the fulfillment of them.
   They did not see Christ. They did not witness the descent of the Holy
   Spirit. They did not hear the Gospel preached. They did not see those
   wonders that they looked for--so is not God ashamed to be called the
   God of people who, after all, did not receive the promises? No, because
   "He has prepared for them a city." They have received the promises
   nowand they shall receive them yet more and more! God will yet cause
   the Believer's life to be all blessing. Do not be afraid of the
   consequences of trusting in Christ--you may have the rough side of the
   road, here, but what we sang, just now, is quite true--

   "Afflictions may press me, they cannot destroy, One glimpse of His love
   turns them all into joy! And the bitterest tears, if He smiles but on
   them, Like dew in the sunshine, grow diamond and gem! Let doubt, then,
   and danger my progress oppose-- They only make Heaven more sweet at the
   close. Come joy or come sorrow, whate'er may befall, An hour with my
   God will make up for them all!"

   If God gave to His children gall and wormwood to drink here--yes, if
   they never had anything but aches and pains from the moment of their
   conversion till they died--yet they would have the best of the bargain,
   after all, for there is an eternity of bliss in the Heaven which is
   prepared for them!

   But, further, these people were a sort of gypsies, always moving about
   and living in tents, different from everybody else. Yes, they were
   strangers among the people where they dwelt And men often say of us,
   now, that we cannot be content to go on as other people do. Those
   Patriarchs were strangers, odd folk, peculiar people. Is not God
   ashamed to be called their God? No, because they have now gone where
   they are all right, for their manners and customs are exactly suitable
   to the place. A very dear old woman, whom I visited when she was dying,
   said to me, "One thing comforts me, Sir, I do not think that God will
   ever send me among the wicked, for I never could get on in their
   company. The best times I have ever had were when I could sit with a
   few of the Lord's people and hear them talk about Him. And though I
   could not always be sure that I was, myself, a Christian, yet I was
   very much like them and I was very happy when I was with them. I think
   I shall go to my own company, Sir." Yes, dear Soul, and so she did! And
   if we are strangers here, we are going to that company where we shall
   not be strangers! They will understand our language when once we get
   across the river into the King's own country. "Therefore God is not
   ashamed to be called their God" because they speak the language which
   He speaks, the language of His own courts--and He is not ashamed to
   say, "These are My people, and I acknowledge them before you all."

   Notice, yet again, that these people were seekers and desirers all
   their lives. "They seek a country." "They desire a better country." Is
   this a right state of heart for a Christian--to always be seeking and
   always desiring? Well, Brothers and Sisters, that is the state in which
   I often am and I wish, still, to stay in that condition--always
   seeking, always desiring. Whenever God gives me any spiritual blessing,
   I always seek more. And if He gives me more, I seek for still more! And
   if He gives me my heart's desire, I pray Him to enlarge my heart that I
   may desire some greater gift. For, in spiritual things, we may be as
   covetous as we like! We may say, "Not as though I had already attained,
   either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may
   apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
   Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended. But this one thing I
   do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
   those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of
   the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." And God is not ashamed to be
   called the God of those who are thus seeking and desiring because He
   has laid up for them all that they seek! And He has prepared for them
   all that they desire! I would be ashamed to set a poor person desiring
   if I could not gratify the desire. I would be ashamed to set a man
   seeking if I knew that he could not get what he sought after. But
   because God has prepared a city for these seekers and desirers, He is
   not ashamed to be called their God!

   As I stood, this evening, by the bedside of the dear Brother whom I
   mentioned to you a little while ago, I could not help saying, "Here is
   a poor soul covered with boils and blisters, but God is not ashamed to
   be called his God." And there may be a child of God who is very poor,
   indeed, with hardly sufficient garments to cover him, but God is not
   ashamed to be called his God, either. Perhaps his own brother is
   ashamed to be called his brother. I have even known cases where men
   have been so wicked as to be ashamed of their own parents because they
   were not so well off as themselves. But God is never ashamed of His
   poor people. Yes, and if God's people are persecuted, and ill-used. If
   they are covered with mud from head to foot, or if they are cast into
   prison, God is not ashamed to be called their God. In those days when
   God permitted His people to be fastened up to the cross, or when others
   were taken to the stake and burnt, and everybody hissed at them, and
   cast out their name as evil, and said that they were the offscouring of
   all things--God was not ashamed to be called their God!

   I am almost ashamed to say what I am going to say. I really feel my
   very heart blush that I should have to say it. I have known some
   professors who have been ashamed to call God their God! Is it not
   strange that the glorious God of Heaven and earth should call a worm
   His own, and take mean wretches such as we are, and say, "I am not
   ashamed to be called their God," and yet that some of these creatures
   should be so miserably cowardly that they are ashamed to be called the
   people of God? Oh, write His name on your foreheads! Never be ashamed
   of it! Ashamed of God? Ashamed of Jesus? Ashamed of the Truth? Ashamed
   of righteousness? I do not wonder that there is such a text as
   this--"The fearful"--that is the cowardly--"and unbelieving shall have
   their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is
   the second death."

   If you really do love the Lord, come out and show yourself on His side!
   And if He is not ashamed of you and if your prayer is, "Lord, remember
   me when you come into Your Kingdom," acknowledge Him as your Lord and
   Savior now! You who are not members of any Christian Church--you who
   have believed in Christ, or think you have--and yet have never
   confessed Him. You who are hiding like rats behind the wall--come out
   and confess Christ! What are you doing? How can you be soldiers of the
   Cross and followers of the Lamb if you fear to acknowledge His cause
   and blush to speak His name? Come out of your hiding places! May God
   the Holy Spirit draw or drive you out at once! If anything could do it,
   surely, it should be such a blessed fact as this--that you are numbered
   among those of whom it is said that "God is not ashamed to be called
   their God."

   God bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

"Jesus Only" --a Communion Meditation

   (No. 2634)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 6, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, AUGUST 2,
   1857.

   "Jesus only." Mark 9:8.

   THIS was the last sight the disciples had upon the mountain and it
   seems to me to have been the best. They saw "Jesus only." Jesus was
   often with His people. He was usually with His disciples, but they did
   not often notice Him as "Jesus only." They probably did so, in this
   case, because He had been accompanied by two great and notable
   personages, who, all of a sudden, withdrew themselves and then, "they
   saw no man any more, save Jesus only." The disciples had seen their
   Lord transfigured and attended by Moses and Elijah, representatives of
   the Law and the Prophets. Suddenly, Moses and Elijah vanished from
   their sight and then, "they saw no man any more, save Jesus only."

   Beloved, we shall never see "Jesus only," till, like the disciples, we
   have seen Moses and Elijah, too! Never was there an eye which saw
   "Jesus only," until it had first seen Moses. We must first pass under
   the rigors of Sinai and the terrors of the Law of God--we must first
   look upon the awful countenance of that dread Lawgiver, whose words are
   thunder, and whose speech is fire. We must be made to tremble beneath
   the denunciations of the Divine Law and stand abashed, astonished and
   amazed while the thunders of the wrath of God roll over our heads. We
   must see Moses first, or else we shall never see "Jesus only." We shall
   be trusting in our own self-righteousness, putting something with
   Christ--making it Christ and self--until Moses comes in and breaks
   self-righteousness into shivers, and stains self with the filth and
   mire of the streets. We must have the breaking down by Moses--the
   smashing hand, the terrible strife that the Law of God brings into the
   conscience--or else we shall never know the sweetness of relying wholly
   upon Jesus and placing our confidence in Him alone.

   And mark you, Beloved, in another sense, we shall never see "Jesus
   only" till we understand something about the Prophets. We must see
   Elijah, or else we shall not see "Jesus only." There are some men who
   have not yet seen Elijah-- they do not understand the prophecies. They
   think they perceive in the future a great progress of civilization and
   they expect to see the spread of the Gospel. They expect to hear of
   great agencies employed, of multitudes of ministers going forth to
   preach the Word of God and of a gradual conversion of the world to the
   religion of Christ. But he who understands the Prophets and has seen
   Elijah, believes not in the immediate conversion of the world, nor in
   universal peace-- he believes in "Jesus only." He expects that Jesus
   will first come and, to him, the great hope of the future is the coming
   of the Son of Man. "I know," he says, "that God shall overturn, and
   overturn, and overturn, until He shall come whose right it is to reign.
   I know that empires shall totter to their bases and that the world
   shall reel to and fro in terror and alarm until He shall appear whose
   name is Melchisedec, the King of Righteousness and the King of Peace,
   who shall set His hand upon the floods and His empire upon the
   rivers--and shall reign 'from sea even to sea, and from the river even
   to the ends of the earth.'" We shall not see "Jesus only," as the
   world's great Deliverer, as the sinners' one Redeemer, as the earth's
   bright Sun, as well as her Morning Star until we have studied the
   prophecies and seen how they all speak concerning Jesus, even of Him
   who is yet to come! We shall see Moses and Elijah first--and when we
   have seen them, their united testimony will lead us to see "Jesus
   only."

   And now, beloved child of God, we are about to approach the Lord's
   Table. I shall only utter a few thoughts which may help you in your
   meditations there. When we come to the Communion Table, we are to think
   of "Jesus only." We have no business with anything, tonight, except
   "Jesus only." We are to forget that we have a wife and children, that
   we have a house or a barn, that we have fields or a shop. We are not to
   remember anything about these things, but to say, as far as we can--

   "Fair from my thoughts, vain world, be gone!

   Leave my religious hours alone.

   Gladly would my eyes my Savior see--

   I wait a visit, Lord, from Thee.

   My heart grows warm with holy fire,

   And kindles with a pure desire.

   Come, my dear Jesus, from above,

   And feed my soul with heavenly love." By God's Grace, tonight, you have
   nothing to do with any other set of people under Heaven. Remember that
   you are coming to the Lord's Table simply as God's saints. There are
   many religious controversies which shake the world, but you have
   nothing to do with them tonight. When you come to the Lord's Table, you
   have nothing to do with the question whether Baptism is by immersion or
   by sprinkling, and nothing to do with the question whether church
   government should be Episcopal or Presbyterian. You have nothing to do
   with what anybody else in the whole world believes. Men may be
   Arminians and you may combat their errors in other places, but not
   here. You have nothing to think of, tonight, except these two
   things--you, a sinner, loved by a gracious Savior. Try, if you can, to
   fix your thoughts on these facts-- "I was lost, perishing, and ruined
   through my own sins but, glory be to God, the all-sufficient Atonement
   of the Lord Jesus Christ has set me free and made me an heir of
   Heaven!" Oh, make "Jesus only" the subject of your thought and your
   trust and, at this Table, cast aside everything else and come, just as
   you are, to Him--and then it will be a precious Lord's Supper to you,
   indeed!

   I am going to speak to you about "Jesus only" and to show you that it
   must be "Jesus only" for your justification. It must be "Jesus only"
   for your sanctifcation. It must be "Jesus only" for your object in life
   and it must be "Jesus only" for your hope of Heaven.

   I. First, it must be "JESUS ONLY" FOR YOUR JUSTIFICATION.

   We were born fools and we shall continue fools till we get to
   Heaven--and one of the foolish things that will always be sprouting out
   of us is our wanting to put something else with Christ in the matter of
   our justification. You tell me you never do that, but I am sure you do.
   You may be the most enlightened and intelligent saint, but,
   unconsciously to yourself, you will be very often joining something to
   Christ and setting up an antichrist in your soul. How often does even
   the most orthodox preacher give utterance to sentiments which seem to
   militate against the great Truth of God that Christ Jesus is our only
   justifying righteousness! It is a hard thing to stick fast by this
   great fundamental Truth--"Jesus only" as the rock and foundation of our
   salvation. Remember, Christian, that the meritorious cause of your
   salvation is not in the least degree dependent upon yourself--it is
   dependent on "Jesus only." Your responsibility is now merged in the
   Divine responsibility of Christ on your behalf. The Lord Jesus has
   covenanted for you that--

   "He will present your soul,

   Unblemished and complete

   Before the glory of His face,

   With joys divinely great"

   O Beloved, always hang your confidence where it ought to hang--on
   "Jesus only!" And when you find yourself full of sin and wickedness,
   grieve over it, but do not think that the ground of your hope is one
   whit the less firm for all that! When sin prevails and guilt rises,
   remember that as your righteousness cannot make Christ's righteousness
   any better, so your sin cannot make it any worse--and, clothed in His
   righteousness, though black with sin, you may, with deep repentance,
   yet with holy faith, cry--

   "When from the dust of death I rise, To take my mansion in the skies,
   Even then shall this be all my plea, 'Jesus has lived and died for me.'
   Bold shall I stand in that great day, For who anything to my charge
   shall lay, While through Christ's blood absolved I am, From sin's
   tremendous curse and shame?"

   And, then, will you please remember that all your good works do not
   make you any safer?\f you were to die the moment you believed and never
   did a good work at all, you would be as sure of Heaven as you would be
   if you lived to love and serve your Maker with all your soul and all
   your might! Remember that the saint who lives from day to day, devoting
   all to Christ, spending and being spent in His Master's service, has
   more happiness than the saint who is not so full of love, but he is not
   a whit more secure. Be active and you will be happy--but do not be
   active in order to be safe! The heir of Heaven is no more secure when
   he is abundant in good works and diligent in the service of God, so far
   as his ultimate salvation is concerned, than when he is allowed to
   backslide and to become faint and weak in the cause of God, for our
   security lies not in anything that we do, or do not do--it lies only in
   the Covenant of Free and Sovereign Grace. And the only basis of our
   salvation is Christ who died for us, "yes, rather, that is risen again,
   who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for
   us."

   I want you also to remember that all your sufferings do not make you
   any safer They make you better, by God's Grace, but they do not make
   you any more sure of Heaven. They are not meritorious afflictions!
   Persons often misjudge concerning their troubles--they think that they
   are punishments for sin. Let the child of God remember that God never
   punishes His children for sin! He chastises them for it, but never with
   the penal punishment of a lawgiver! God's people were punished, once
   and for all, in the Person of their Scapegoat and Surety, Jesus
   Christ--and God will never punish twice for the same offense. The
   chastisements of God's Providence are the fatherly acts of His
   love--they are not the wrathful acts of His justice! As the righteous
   Judge, God cannot punish either you or me, if we are believers in
   Jesus. As holding the scepter of righteousness, He cannot unsheathe the
   sword against a Believer! He has punished our sins upon the Lord
   Jesus--the whole of the vials of His wrath were emptied on Christ's
   head--and they cannot now come on yours or mine. But, as a Father, God
   uses the rod. As a loving and tender Father, He uses chastisements and,
   as a kind Physician, He gives us bitter medicines to take.

   But, for your own sake, and for Christ's sake, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, do not get to mingling your own sufferings with the Savior's.
   Remember, if you suffered ever so much, all your sufferings would not
   be any atonement for your sins, nor even a punishment for them unless
   you are one of those who are not redeemedand, therefore, bear the
   penalty of your own sin and perish everlastingly! But, as a child of
   God, as a redeemed and elect vessel of mercy, your sufferings are not
   penal and, suffer or not suffer, the Atonement of Christ is enough for
   you--you, by God's Grace, can say, "Jesus only is the ground of my
   justification. I will rest there and nowhere else."

   And now I will ask you, Beloved, do you not frequently find when you
   have been in a very good frame of mind, when you have been praying well
   at the Prayer Meeting and helping the poor, when the minister has
   patted you on the back and said what a good fellow you were, and the
   deacons have looked lovingly at you and said you were a very useful
   man, and when you have got on well at Sunday school, and have had a
   letter from Mary James, telling you that she was converted through your
   teaching--do you not find that you have gone home and you do not know
   how it was, but, in a day or two, you got so dull and low, you could
   not tell what was the matter with you? Have you ever thought what was
   the cause of it? You have lost all your hope and confidence and you
   have been obliged to come, as a guilty sinner, to the footstool of
   Christ's mercy and take His love and blood to be your only trust? Do
   you know why it was you were so low in spirit?

   It was for this reason. Unconsciously to yourself, you had been leaning
   a little on your own good works! You had said to yourself, "Well, now,
   I really begin to think I am sure of Heaven. Look, are not these things
   the fruits of the Spirit? Oh, may I not rejoice with confidence? Am I
   not secure? Surely, now I am safe! How I prayed the other day! What a
   blessed season I had in private prayer the other evening! Now I know I
   can trust Christ." Stop, my Friend! You are really saying, "I know I
   can now trust in myself," for that is the English of it! And then you
   get into a heavy, dull frame of mind for a long time afterwards, only
   to make you spell out those two words, "Jesus only." And He will make
   you spell them out until you are bound to say, every day, by a
   constraint upon your heart and conscience, that it must be there, and
   there, alone, that you can put your confidence and trust! That is the
   first point--"Jesus only" for our justification. II. Next, it must be
   "JESUS ONLY" TO SANCTITY US.

   Some professors will not say so. "We are justified by God," they say,
   "but we have to sanctify ourselves." They believe in what they call
   progressive sanctification. Is that Scriptural or not? Well, I have
   always thought that sanctifica-tion is continual, but I am not sure
   that it is progressive. Many divines have written it down as a settled
   truth, that God's people are sanctified progressively and that, the
   longer they are here, the more and more sanctified they get. Did any of
   them ever stop and ask an old Believer whether he found it so? I have
   asked many and I have heard a venerable saint, whose hairs are silvered
   over with gray, say, "I think my heart is as bad, now, as ever it was.
   And I am sure if it is not actually so, I think it is, and it plagues
   me more than it ever did." It has been the custom to pray God to
   protect young men in the slippery paths of youth. Why, the paths of old
   age are quite as slippery! They are allslippery paths--all the way to
   Heaven! The old nature still remains in us, unchanged and unchangeable,
   and there will have to be a fight between the new nature and the old
   nature, between the house of David and the house of Saul until, at
   last, the house of David shall overcome and we shall get clean free
   from sin. Beloved, do not be looking, with regard to your
   sanctification, for any great progress! Expect it to be continual every
   day, but do not expect that your old nature will get holier every day--
   and in your sanctification take this for your motto, "Jesus only."

   If you cannot see Christ in your prayers, and in your good works, away
   with them! Your good works are sins unless Christ Jesus lies in them!
   Unless through Him, and for Him, and by Him, you perform your works,
   your best works are bad works! Remember, it is not the outward fashion
   of the work, it is the inward spirit of it that makes it good.
   Therefore, it is not the mere outward appearance of sanctification, it
   is the inward spirit of it that makes it true sanctifcation. Desire,
   then, if you desire and pray for sanctification, not after the virtues
   of a Paul, or after the glories of an Evangelist, or the magnificent
   excellences of some of God's saints--but desire, first and last, after
   the Character of Jesus, in all its sublimity and perfection! And pray
   for the Spirit of Jesus to sanctify you, for, "Jesus only" is enough in
   sanctification, as the pattern to which you are to attain, and as the
   One who, by His Spirit, shall make you conformable unto Himself.

   Keep your eyes on your Savior, as much in your good works as in your
   bad ones. After your prayers, look to the Cross, as well as after your
   sins. After the Lord's Supper, look to the Cross, as well as after a
   fall. Look to the Savior as much in almsgiving, as much in Bible
   reading, as much in preaching, as much as you ever do in looking to Him
   for justification, for, unless you do, your sins will unman you, yet,
   and bring you down, again, with some sad fall to make you learn the
   truth of this motto, "Jesus only."

   III. Now, dear Friends, thirdly, I will speak of "JESUS ONLY" AS THE
   OBJECT OF OUR LIVES.

   It was my privilege, this morning, to address a congregation, most of
   you being present, from the text, [Sermon #144,

   Volume 3-- Waiting Only Upon God] "My soul, wait you only upon

   God." Now, if you please, just extract the marrow out of the morning's
   discourse and put that into the third head. Let "Jesus only" be the
   object of your life. Oh, I pray the Holy Spirit so to enter into our
   hearts, minds, consciences, judgments and affections, that every
   idolatrous love--all affection towards everything but Christ--may be
   cast out of all the Lord's family and that they may be brought to set
   Jesus upon the throne of their hearts, and to utterly crush every
   rival! O Brothers and Sisters, after all, we do not love Jesus Christ
   much! Oh, if we saw the ocean of Christ's love running towards us, and
   the little stream of our love running towards Him, what a shocking
   contrast it would be on our part! There is His love--I cannot see
   across it! It is a sea without a shore! The wings of imagination flag
   with fatigue before they can cross that shoreless sea! There is His
   love--I cannot fathom it! The plumb line fails. But, oh, here is our
   love-- it is a little stream that is almost dry! The heat of worldly
   joys will sometimes absorb it till the stones stand in the bed of its
   little brook, unwashed and dry. Oh, it is so small that sometimes it
   takes an hour to scoop up so much as a cupful of it to give to the
   Lord's poor family! It will take us, perhaps, a week to get even a
   consciousness that we love Christ--and we will be singing for hours
   together--

   "Tis a point I long to know,

   Oft it causes anxious thought!

   O do I love the Lord, or no?

   Am I His, or am I not?"

   That is because we have so little love--otherwise we would know whether
   we did love Him or not. If we loved Him more, there would be no doubt
   about it! But we love Him so little that we have reason to cry, "O
   Jesus, fill our hearts with Your love! Come and enter our souls and
   reign there forevermore!" I beseech you, dear Friends, do not be
   content with the poor little paltry love you already have. Ask Him who
   gave you that little which you have, to give you a thousand times more!
   Do not sing that hymn--

   "Had I ten thousand tongues, they all Should join the harmony." Do not
   wish for so many tongues. Do not say--

   "Had I ten thousand hearts, dear Lord, I'd give them all to You."

   Try and give Him the one you have--that will be enough for you. Ask
   that your whole heart may be offered on the altar, that your whole
   tongue may be dedicated to God and that your body, soul and spirit may
   be a whole burnt-offering, holy and acceptable unto God, presented to
   Him as your reasonable service. "Jesus only." Put that on your banner
   and go on fighting for "Jesus only." Strive not for sect or party.
   Strive not for self or family. Strive not for your own aggrandizement
   or wealth, but sanctify all you do, sacred or secular, with this motto,
   "I do it for Jesus only." IV. And then, Beloved, to conclude--"JESUS
   ONLY" IS OUR ONE HOPE OF HEAVEN. What do I hope to have when I die? I
   may answer, in the words of my text, "Jesus only." "Whom have I in
   Heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside You."
   Be not beguiled with the poet's visionary Heaven--he tells you of a
   Heaven of the intellect, a Heaven of imagination. Be not carried away,
   like children, by any such fictitious paradise! The Heaven of your
   heart, and the only Heaven that can content it, is "Jesus only." To lie
   in His embrace, to be pressed to His bosom, to feel the kisses of His
   lips, to drink the wine of His eternal love, to be forever steeped in
   the ocean of His Grace, to know His heart, to behold His Countenance,
   to admire His beauties and to be swallowed up in His Glory is the
   highest ambition of the Believer! There is nothing in Heaven that is
   equal to Christ! There is no flower in all the gardens of Paradise that
   blooms so sweetly as the Rose of Sharon! There is not a gem with which
   the crowns of the glorified are now adorned that glistens one half so
   gloriously as the eye of Christ! There is not a splendor in the realms
   of Paradise, however God-like and Divine, that is one half so majestic
   as that head of His, the locks whereof are bushy and black as a
   raven's. Well may we sing--

   "When shall I see Your smiling face,

   That face which often I have seen?

   Arise, you Sun of Righteousness,

   Scatter the clouds that intervene."

   And--

   "Oh when, you city of my God, Shall I, your courts ascend, Where
   congregations never break up, And Sabbaths have no end?"

   Oh, when shall I behold my Savior and, wrapped in His embrace, be
   forever blest? So "Jesus only" is our one hope of Heaven!

   Now, poor Christian, you have this precious treasure, have you not? I
   was wondering how a man would feel if he could say that he had nothing
   in the world but "Jesus only." You do not know, and I do not know. You
   have a pretty fair income now--you are tolerably well off and you have
   good strong limbs. You can work and earn your own living. But now
   suppose a case. Suppose there is a man somewhere on the face of the
   earth who can say, "There, now, I have not a rag nor a crust. I have
   not in the whole world so much as would fetch a solitary half-farthing.
   I have no health, I am as sick as I can be. I have no fame--foul
   slanders have blasted my character. I have no friends. I have buried
   the last of my family. I have no earthly hopes, no prospects. All that
   I have is 'Jesus only!'" Now, I can imagine, no, I can express my firm
   belief that a consciousness of the possession of Jesus would have such
   an overcoming effect upon the heart of this poor beggar that he would
   forget his poverty, forget his nakedness, forget his lack of kindred
   and forget his hopelessness! This one thought would swallow up all his
   misery--"I have Christ! How, then, can I be poor when I have Him?"

   But, now, there is another case which you need notsuppose. Perhaps such
   a man is here tonight. You have a fortune! Or you have money enough for
   your needs. You have a wife and children. You have houses, lands, a
   name, honor and reputation. You seem to have everything! What is there
   that you have not? I go into your pantry--it is well-stocked. I go into
   your parlor--it is well-furnished. I go into your treasury and see your
   coffers--there is abundance--your business yards and warehouses are
   filled with goods. The whole place is busy, from the highest room to
   the lowest, and a stream of wealth is pouring in upon you every day.
   You have everything that heart can wish--except Christ. Now, I cannot,
   by any flight of imagination, think of you as a happy man! I did not
   need to stretch my thoughts to think of that poor penniless beggar as
   being happy, after all, but I cannot imagine that if you know what it
   is to be without Christ, you can be a happy man. Just think a moment
   what will happen to you if you continue living as you now are. You will
   die and your soul will be driven into Hell! Within a little while, your
   riches will "take to themselves wings and fly away."

   Your family may die, or if they do not, you will die--you cannot take
   your money with you. If you are buried in a gold coffin, it will not
   enrich you! All your lands will belong to another. Somebody else's eyes
   must see your fair acres. Somebody else's hands shall pluck the fruit
   from your trees. Think of this and then remember that all this while
   you will be in Hell--in torments! I cannot think of you as a happy man.

   Go home and take your wine--and see damnation in its dregs! Go home and
   walk over your farm and see death in its clods, and damnation in its
   meadows! Go home to your house and climb its topmost story and look
   abroad upon your estates and see the autumn coming on--and remember
   that "we do all fade as a leaf" and that, if not in Christ, our
   transgressions, like the wind, shall carry us away! Go home and let the
   thoughts of eternal fire mingle with all you have! You have all things
   but Christ. Go, then, and stir up in your most joyous pleasures the
   prospect of eternal wrath! And if you can be happy after that, you must
   not be men! You must be brute beasts.

   But if you can say, "Jesus," do not be afraid to say, "Jesus only." If
   you have a prospect of losing all, gladly give it up for Christ. If you
   are afraid you should not have enough, just be sure of this--that if
   you have Jesus, you have enough! And remember, if the worst should come
   to the worst and you were locked up in prison without a bed to lie on,
   or a crust to eat--if you had Jesus with you, you might be as happy as
   an angel in your prison! But if you had all the wealth of India, you
   might be as wretched as a devil if you had not Christ with you. Oh,
   treasure up the text and make it true of yourself, "Jesus only!"

   And you, poor Souls, who are panting to know the way to Heaven,
   remember, there is only one ladder that can ever take you there. The
   rungs of it are made by Sovereign Grace. That ladder is called Jesus.
   The foot rests on the earth, in His humanity. The top leans in Heaven,
   on His Godhead. Poor Sinner, run up the rungs! Do you think you are so
   heavy that you will break the them? Oh, no! There have been some stout
   old sinners up that ladder before now! Many a guilty one has run up it
   with enough weight of sin upon his back to have crushed the heavens
   into Hell if God had put their sin there! But the ladder has never been
   broken, yet, and it never will be! Up with you, Sinner! If your feet
   are ever so black, they will not soil the ladder. Run up with all your
   sin, and care, and woe! Come to the Lord Jesus and He will not cast you
   away, for He has said, "He that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast
   out."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 11.

   This is a very familiar chapter, but it is none the less precious. It
   is the roll of the heroes of faith. Here you have a list of the men who
   believed in God and who, therefore, did great things.

   Verses 1, 2. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the
   evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good
   report. "The elders"--that is, those who lived in the ancient
   times--worked wondrous works by faith, and the "report" of them still
   encourages others to try to do likewise.

   3. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word
   of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
   appear That is one of the earliest lessons of faith. We do not discover
   the secrets of Creation by mere reason, or the teachings of science--it
   is only by Divine Revelation that the marvelous story can reach us.
   Faith accepts the Inspired declaration that God made all things, and
   that the things that are seen were made out of things that are not
   seen, so that, after all, the foundation of everything is that which is
   not seen. The visible is but a dream. The things which are round about
   us are the transient things that shall all pass away. The things that
   are not seen are eternal and shall abide forever. The things which are
   seen were made out of the invisible, not out of things which are seen.

   4. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
   by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of
   his gifts: and by it he, being dead, yet speaks. Paul begins his list
   of heroes of faith with Abel. And you will notice that faith works
   differently in each one of these mighty men. It is the same living
   principle in all of them, but they are different men and their faith is
   seen in very different circumstances. Faith is able to work in all
   manner of ways--it is good at everything. There is nothing that God
   calls us to do but faith can enable us to accomplish it. In Abel's
   case, we see that faith is grand at worshipping. Faith brings a right
   sacrifice--brings it in the right way and speaks even after she is
   dead, for the blood of Abel cried out of the ground. Oh, that all of us
   might so live that, even out of our graves, there might come a voice
   speaking for God!

   5, 6. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
   was not found, because God had translated him: for before his
   translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. But without
   faith it is impossible to please Him: for He that comes to God must
   believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him. See, here, how faith has learned the secret art of pleasing
   God. God is the thrice-Holy One. He is a jealous God and a very little
   sin greatly provokes Him. But faith knows how to please Him. I do not
   wonder that Enoch did not die--it was a less thing to be translated to
   Heaven than it was to please God! To live for 300 years in constant
   communion with God, as he did, to be always pleasing God, was a mighty
   triumph of faith! May God grant that during all the years that we live,
   whether they are few or many, we may so live as always to please Him!
   "But without faith it is impossible to please

   Him."

   7. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
   with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his home; by which he
   condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by
   faith Fear and faith may sometimes dwell together. There is a holy,
   humble fear that perfect love never casts out, but entertains and
   cherishes-- this is the kind of fear that Noah possessed. "Being warned
   of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, he prepared an ark."
   Noah was a practical life-saver--an ark-builder. And so he became the
   second father of the human race--a sort of new Adam--and that simply by
   his faith! Oh, what is there that is impossible to the man who believes
   in God? "All things are possible to him that believes."

   8. By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
   should layer receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not
   knowing where he went He was self-exiled from his home--a wanderer upon
   the face of the earth. Yet, when called of God, it mattered not to him
   where he was bid go! He seemed to say, "Appoint my way, great God. It
   is for me not to ask the reason why, but to obey Your command"

   9-11. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
   country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
   him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which has
   foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God. Through faith, also, Sara
   herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a
   child when she was past age, because she judged Him faithful who had
   promised. So that faith made the barren woman to keep house and to be a
   joyful mother! Faith has caused our spiritual barrenness to bring forth
   abundantly. Oh, that some barren soul here might catch the blessed
   influences of faith and begin at once to bear fruit for God!

   12. Therefore sprang there even of one, andhim asgoodas dead, so many
   as the stars of the sky in multitude, andas the sand which is by the
   sea shore innumerable. "Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as
   good as dead." That "one" was Isaac, for he was given up to die and,
   apparently, nothing could save him from death. Yet God did save him,
   and from him there sprang "so many as the stars of the sky in
   multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."

   13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
   having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
   them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
   ' 'These all"--Paul means Abraham, Sarah, Isaac and Jacob "died in
   faith." They "embraced" the promises--threw their arms round them--
   hugged them to their hearts--embraced them as those who dearly loved
   them!

   14. 15. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
   country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where
   they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. If
   they were seeking a country, might they not have gone back to their own
   country from where they came out? No. True Believers know nothing about
   going back! We are bound to go forward to the better land that is
   before us! Almighty Grace will not permit the people of God to turn
   aside and find their rest anywhere else. We are bound for the Kingdom
   of God and, by the Grace of God, we shall not rest until we enter it,
   to go no more out forever.

   16-19. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
   therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He has
   prepared for them a city. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered
   up Isaac: and be that had received the promises offered up his
   only-begotten son, of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed
   he called: accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
   dead, from whence also he received him in a figure. See how faith
   consecrates natural affection! See also how faith laughs at
   impossibilities. Abraham expects that God will raise his son from the
   dead, or do something equally amazing, so that the promise He had given
   shall be fulfilled. It was not Abraham's business to keep God's promise
   for Him. It was God's business to do that for Himself and He did it.
   You remember how Rebecca tried to make God's promise come true for
   Jacob, and what a mess she made by her plotting and scheming!

   When we give our attention to keeping God's precepts and leave Him to
   fulfill His own promises, all will be well. It was Abraham's part to
   offer up his son--it was God's part to fulfill the promise to his seed
   according to the Covenant which He had made.

   20. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
   Looking into the future, although he was blind. Poor old man, lying
   upon his bed, with his eyes so dim that he could not tell one of his
   sons from another, he could yet look into the future and bless his sons
   "concerning things to come." Oh, what sharp eyes faith has! Even when
   the eyes of bodily vision have become dim, we may see far more by faith
   than we can by sight.

   21. By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
   Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff Ah, that
   staff of his! You know why he used it? I believe he loved it because it
   made him remember the Brook Jabbok where "he halted upon his thigh." It
   had long been his companion, for he said, "With my staff I passed over
   this Jordan." But it became more than ever necessary to him after he
   had won that victory and had also learned his own weakness. And now, as
   if in memory of the God who had blessed him, he leans upon the top of
   his staff and blesses the sons of Joseph. Now the chapter goes on with
   a long list of those who, by faith, worked wonders.

   22-31. By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of
   the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. By
   faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents,
   because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the
   king's commandment By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused
   to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer
   affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of evil
   for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the
   reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
   for he endured, as seeing Him who is invisible. Through faith he kept
   the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest He that destroyed the
   firstborn should touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea
   as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned. By
   faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about
   seven days. By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that
   believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. What? Has the
   unchaste Rahab got in here with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph--the
   chaste Joseph? Yes! "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them
   that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace." She hid
   them in her house, although that action would have cost her her life if
   they had been discovered. And though there was some deception mixed
   with her faith, which we need not dwell upon now, yet God the Holy
   Spirit records her faith and hides her fault.

   32-39. And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of
   Gideon, and ofBarak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; of David, also,
   and Samuel, and of the Prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms,
   worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
   quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of
   weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the
   armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again:
   and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might
   obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mocking and
   scourging, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned,
   they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they
   wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted,
   tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy). They wandered in
   deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And
   these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not
   the promise. They did not live to see Christ come. They expected Him,
   but before the time when Paul was writing--before the actual coming of
   Christ--they had all passed away. "These all, having obtained a good
   report through faith, received not the promise."

   40. God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
   should not be made perfect Is it not wonderful that we, who bring up
   the rear of the army of faith, are necessary to its completeness? It
   cannot be perfect without us! Yes, Heaven itself will not be complete
   without us who are on the road to it! There would be empty seats in the
   holy orchestra, gaps in the sacred circle--so we who believe must all
   go there to make them perfect. God help us to hasten on our road, for
   our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 13, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   21, 1882.

   "His Son, whom He has appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He
   made the worlds; who being the brightness of His Glory, and the express
   image of His Person and upholding all things by the word ofHispower,
   when He had, by Himself, purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of
   the Majesty on high." Hebrews 1:2.

   I HAVE nothing to do tonight but to preach Jesus Christ. This was the
   old subject of the first Christian ministers-- "Daily in the Temple and
   in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ." When
   Philip went down to the city of Samaria, he "preached Christ unto
   them." When he sat with the Ethiopian eunuch in his chariot, he,
   "preached unto him, Jesus." As soon as Paul was converted, "straightway
   he preached Christ in the synagogues." For once we count the
   venerableness of our subject well worthy of mentioning, we shall not be
   ashamed to preach what the Apostles preached and what martyrs and
   confessors preached! We hope to proclaim this glorious Gospel of the
   blessed God as long as we live! And we hope that when this generation
   of preachers shall have passed away, unless the Lord shall come, there
   will always be found a succession of men who shall determine to preach
   nothing "save Jesus Christ and Him crucified."

   For, after all, this is the subject which men most of all need. They
   may have cravings after other things, but nothing can satisfy the deep
   real need of their nature but Jesus Christ and salvation by His
   precious blood! He is the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven! He
   is the Water of Life of which, if a man drinks, he shall never thirst
   again! Hence, it becomes us to be often dwelling upon this theme, for
   it is most necessary to the sons of men. This is the subject which God
   the Holy Spirit delights to bless. I am sure that, other things being
   equal, He honors preaching in proportion to the savor of Christ that is
   in it! I may preach a great deal about the Church, but the Holy Spirit
   does not take of the things of Christ to glorify the Church. I may
   preach doctrine or practice apart from Christ--that would be giving the
   husk without the kernel--but where Jesus Christ sweetens all and savors
   all, there will the Holy Spirit delight to rest upon the ministry and
   make it quick and powerful to the conversion of men! And I am sure,
   dear Friends, that the preaching of Christ is always sweet in the ears
   of His own people. "Your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do
   the virgins love You." And this theme is most pleasing to God the
   Father, who loves to hear His Son extolled and exalted. He delights in
   His Son--and those who delight in Him are friends of God. When Jesus
   Christ is lifted up, it is as God the Father would have it! It is as
   the Holy Spirit would have it and, where this is the case, we may
   expect to have seals to our ministry and souls for our hire!

   I want, at this time, as it were, to let Jesus Christ speak for
   Himself. I cannot speak for Him as He can speak for Himself. Shall I
   hold my candle to the sun, as if it needed it in order to reveal its
   light? No, certainly not! And, therefore, I shall, with studied
   plainness, try to set the text, itself, before you and so to speak of
   it that you may not so much remember what I have said of it as that you
   may remember the Subject, Himself. My theme is to be the Savior--the
   only Savior--the Savior who must save you or else you must perish, "for
   there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must
   be saved." I am about to speak of Him and I think that all who are
   aware of the necessity of being saved will only want to hear about
   Him--and to know how they may get to Him and how He may be made their
   Savior. And if they can but be told this, they will be only too glad to
   listen!

   So, first, I shall speak of who the Savior is. Let me read the text to
   you again. "His Son"--God's Son--"whom He has appointed Heir of all
   things, by whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of
   His Glory, and the express image of His Person, and upholding all
   things by the word of His power." That is who Jesus is! Then, in the
   second place, I shall speak of what Jesus did. "When He had by Himself
   purged our sins." Then, thirdly, I want to tell you what He enjoys.
   After He had finished His great work of salvation, He "sat down at the
   right hand of the Majesty on high."

   I. It is not possible that any language can fully express WHO JESUS IS.
   Yet, by the Holy Spirit's gracious teaching, I must tell you what I
   know of Him.

   First, Jesus is God's own Son. What do I know about that wondrous Truth
   of God? If I were to try to explain it and to talk about the Eternal
   Sonship, I should but conduct you where I should soon be entirely out
   of my depth and, very likely, I would drown all that I could tell you
   in floods of words. Deity is not to be explained, but to be adored--and
   the Sonship of Christ is to be accepted as a Truth of Revelation and to
   be apprehended by faith, though it cannot be comprehended by the
   understanding. There have been many attempts made by the fathers of the
   Church to explain the relationship between the two Divine Persons, the
   Father and the Son. But the explanations had better never have been
   given, for the figures used are liable to lead into mistakes. Suffice
   it for us to say that in the most appropriate language of the Ni-cene
   Creed, Christ is "God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God." He
   is co-equal with the Father, though how that is, we know not. He stands
   in the nearest possible relationship to the Father--a relationship of
   intense love and delight, so that the Father says of Him, "This is My
   beloved Son." Yes, He is One with the Father, so that there is no
   separating them, as He, Himself, said, in reply to Philip's request,
   "Show us the Father," "Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the
   Father in Me."

   Let me pause here and say to everyone who is seeking salvation--What a
   comfort it should be to you that He, who is come to save men, is
   Divine! Therefore, nothing can be impossible to Him. No, I do not say
   merely that He is Divine--I will go further and say that He is the
   Deity itself! Christ Jesus is God and, being God, there can be no
   impossibilities or even difficulties with Him. He is able to save you,
   whoever you may be! Though you have gone to the very verge of eternal
   ruin, you cannot have gone beyond the range of Omnipotence--and
   Omnipotence is inherent in the Godhead. O dear Friends, rejoice in this
   wondrous Truth of God--He that was a Babe at Bethlehem, was God
   Incarnate! He that, being weary, sat on the well at Sychar, was God
   Incarnate! He that had no where to lay His head was God Incarnate. And
   it is He who has undertaken the stupendous labor of the salvation of
   men and, therefore, men may hope and trust in Him! We need not wonder
   that when angels heard of Christ's coming to earth, they sang, "Glory
   to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men," for
   God had taken upon Himself human flesh that He might save the sons of
   men. So, the first words in our text--"His Son"--are full of good
   cheer!

   Now notice, in the next place, that Jesus Christ is the "Heir of all
   things." Of which Nature of Christ does the Apostle speak in this
   sentence, "whom He has appointed Heir of all things"? I do not think
   that Paul, here, separates the two Natures, so as to speak with
   absolute reference to either one or the other, but he speaks of the
   Person of Christ, and in that Person there is God, and in that same
   Person there is most surely and most truly, Man. But we must take this
   description of Jesus Christ as appointed "Heir of all things" in His
   Person as Man and as God and Man combined, for, as God, alone, Christ
   is necessarily, "Heir of all things" without any appointment. But in
   His complex Person as God and Man conjoined, the Father has appointed
   Him to be "Heir of all things."

   Now, what does this mean but that Christ possesses all things as an
   heir possesses his inheritance--that Christ is Lord of all things, as
   an heir becomes lord and ruler among his brethren? This appointment is
   to be fully carried into effect by-and-by, for, "now we see not yet all
   things put under Him." Christ is Lord of all the angels--not a seraph
   spreads his wings except at the bidding of the "Heir of all things."
   There are no bright spirits, unknown to us, that are beyond the control
   of the God-Man, Christ Jesus. And the fallen angels, too, are obliged
   to bow before His Omnipotence. As for all things here below, material
   substances, men regenerate or unregenerate, God has given Him power
   over all flesh that He should give eternal life to as many as His
   Father has given Him. He has put all things under His feet, "and the
   government shall be upon His shoulders." He is Heir, or Master, and
   Possessor of all things--let me say, of all sorts of blessings and all
   forms of Grace, for, "it pleased the Father that in Him should all
   fullness dwell." And, as surely as time revolves and you mark the
   fleeting minutes upon the dial's face, the hour is coming when Christ
   shall be universally acknowledged as King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
   Already I seem to hear the shouts go up from every part of the
   habitable globe and from all Heaven and all space, "Hallelujah! For the
   Lord God, Omnipotent, reigns." All must willingly, or else unwillingly,
   submit to His sway, for His Father has appointed Him "Heir of all
   things."

   To my mind, this is another wondrous encouragement to anyone who is
   seeking salvation. Christ has everything in His hand that is needed in
   order that He may save you, poor Sinner! Sometimes, when a physician
   has a sick man before him--suppose it is on board ship--he may have to
   say to him, "I think I could cure your disease if I could get
   such-and-such a medicine, but, unfortunately, I have not the drug
   within my reach." Or the doctor might have to say to the sufferer, "I
   believe an operation would effect a cure, but I have not the
   instruments necessary for it." Never will the great Physician of souls
   have to talk like that, for the Father has committed all things into
   His hand. Oh, have we not beheld Him as the Glory of the Father, full
   of Grace and Truth? You great sinner, you black sinner, Christ is not
   lacking in power to save you! And if you come and trust yourself in His
   hands, He will never have to look about to find the balm for your
   wounds, or the ointments or liniments with which to bind up those
   putrefying sores of yours! No, He is "Heir of all things." So again I
   say, "Hallelujah!" as I preach Him to you as the blessed Savior of
   sinners, the Son of God, the "Heir of all things."

   Notice, next, that Jesus Christ is the Creator "by whom also He made
   the worlds." However many worlds there are, we know not. It may be true
   that all those majestic orbs that stud the midnight sky are worlds
   filled with intelligent beings. And it is much more easy to believe
   that they are than that they are not, for, surely, God has not built
   all those magnificent mansions and left them untenanted! It were
   irrational to conceive of those myriads of stupendous worlds, vastly
   bigger than this poor little speck in God's great universe, all left
   without inhabitants. But it matters not how many worlds there are--God
   made them all by Jesus Christ--"All things were made by Him; and
   without Him was not anything made that was made."

   I see Him standing, as it were, at the anvil of Omnipotence, hammering
   out the worlds that fly off, like sparks, on every side at each stroke
   of His majestic arm. It was Christ who was there--"the Wisdom of God
   and the Power of God," as Paul calls Him--creating all things! I love
   to think that He who created all things is also our Savior, for then He
   can create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. And
   if I need a complete new creation--as I certainly do-- He is equal to
   the task! Man cannot create the tiniest gnat that ever danced in the
   summer evening's ray. Man cannot create even a single grain of dust,
   but Christ created all worlds, so He can make us new creatures by the
   wondrous power of His Grace. O Sinners, see what a mighty Savior has
   been provided for you and never say that you cannot trust Him! I agree
   with good Mr. Hyatt who, when he was asked on his deathbed, "Can you
   trust Christ with your soul?" answered, "If I had a million souls, I
   could trust them all with Him!" And so may you! If you had as many
   souls as God has ever created and if you had heaped upon you all the
   sins that men have ever committed, you might still trust in Him who is
   the Son of God, "whom He has appointed Heir of all things, by whom also
   He made the worlds."

   Now go a little further and see what Christ is next called--the
   brightness of His Father's Glory. Shade your eyes, for you cannot look
   upon this wondrous sight without being dazzled by it! The Revised
   Version renders it, "the effulgence of His Glory," but I do not see
   much more in that expression than in the word, "brightness." Some
   commentators say-- and it is not a bad figure, yet we must not push any
   figure too far--that, as light is to the sun, so is Jesus to the Glory
   of God. He is the brightness of that Glory, that is to say, there is
   not any Glory in God but what is also in Christ. And when that Glory
   reaches its climax, when God the Ever-Glorious is most Glorious, that
   greatest Glory is in Christ. Oh, this wondrous Word of God--the very
   climax of the Godhead--the gathering up of every blessed Attribute in
   all its infinity of Glory--you shall find all this in the Person of the
   God-Man, Christ Jesus! There is a whole sermon in those words, "the
   brightness of His Glory," but I cannot preach it tonight because then I
   should not get through the rest of my text.

   So let us pass on to the next clause. "And the express image of His
   Person." I said, a minute ago, "Shade your eyes," but I might now say,
   "Shut them," as I think of the excessive brilliance described by these
   words--"the express image of His Person." Whatever God is, Christ
   is--the very likeness of God, the very Godhead of Godhead, the very
   Deity of Deity is in Christ Jesus--"the express image of His Person."
   Dr. John Owen, who loves to explain the spiritual meaning in the
   Epistle to the Hebrews by the types in the Old Testament, which is
   evidently what Paul, himself, was doing, under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit--explains the brightness of the Father's Glory by a reference to
   the Shekinah over the Mercy Seat, which was the only visible token of
   the Presence of God there. An extraordinary brightness is said to have
   shone forth from between the cherubim.

   Now, Christ is God manifesting Himself in His brightness. But, on his
   forehead, the High Priest wore a golden plate, upon which was deeply
   engraved in Hebrew letters, the inscription, "Holiness to [or, of,]
   Jehovah." Dr. Owen thinks there is a reference in this "express image
   of His Person"--this cut-out inscription of God, as it were--to that
   which was on the forehead of the High Priest and which represented the
   glorious wholeness or holiness of Jehovah, which is His great Glory.
   Well, whether the Apostle referred to this or not, it is for you and me
   to take off our shoes in the Presence of Christ, "the brightness of His
   Father's Glory, and the express image of His Person." To me, these
   words are like the bush in which God dwelt, yet which was not
   consumed--they are all on fire--what more shall I say of them?

   Now, Christ being all this that Paul describes, who will dare to turn
   his back on Him? If this is the Shepherd who has come to seek the lost
   sheep--O poor lost Sheep, will you not be found of Him? If this is
   God's Ambassador who comes clothed in the crimson robe of His own blood
   to redeem the sons of men--who will refuse the peace He brings?

   Note yet, once again, what Christ is as I mention the sixth point in
   the Apostle's description--"upholding all things by the word of His
   power," Just think of it! This great world of ours is upheld by
   Christ's word! If He did not speak it into continued existence, it
   would go back into the nothingness from which it sprang. There exists
   not a being who is independent of the Mediator, save only the
   ever-blessed Father and the Spirit. "By Him all things consist," that
   is, continue to hold together. Just as these pillars uphold these
   galleries, or as the foundations uphold a house, so does Jesus Christ
   "uphold all things by the word of His power." Only think of it! Those
   innumerable worlds of light that make illimitable space to look as
   though it were sprinkled over with golden dust would all die out like
   so many expiring sparks, and cease to be if the Christ who died on
   Calvary did not will that they should continue to exist! I cannot bring
   out of my text all the wondrous Truths of God that it contains, I only
   wish I could. But, surely, if Christ upholds all things, He can uphold
   me. If the word of His power upholds earth and Heaven, surely, that
   same word can uphold you, poor trembling Heart, if you will trust Him!
   There need be no fear about that matter--come and prove it for
   yourself. May His blessed Spirit enable you to do so even now!

   Where there is so much room, I might well tarry, but I must hasten on
   to the next point.

   II. Follow me with all your ears and hearts while I now speak to you
   about WHAT JESUS DID.

   He who is all that I have tried to describe, did what? First, He
   effectually purged our sins--"when He had, by Himself, purged our
   sins." Listen to those wondrous words! There was never such a task as
   that since time began. The old fable speaks of the Augean stable, foul
   enough to have poisoned a nation, which Hercules cleansed, but our sins
   were fouler than that! Dunghills are sweet compared with these
   abominations! What a degrading task it seems for Christ to
   undertake--the purging of our sins! The sweepers of the streets, the
   dishwashers of the kitchen, the cleansers of the sewers have honorable
   work compared with this of purging sin! Yet the holy Christ, incapable
   of sin, stooped to purge our sins! I want you to meditate upon that
   wondrous work and to remember that He did it before He went back to
   Heaven. Is it not a wonderful thing that Christ purged our sins even
   before we had committed them? There they stood, before the sight of
   God, as already existent in all their hideousness--but Christ came, and
   purged them. This, surely, ought to make us sing the song of songs!
   Before I sinned, He purged my sins away--amazing and strange as it is,
   yet it is so!

   Then, further, the Apostle says that Christ purged our sins by Himself
   That is, by offering Himself as our Substitute. There was no purging
   away of sin except by Christ bearing the burden of it, and He did bear
   it. He bore all that was due to guilty man on account of his violation
   of the Law of God, and God accepted His Sacrifice as a full equivalent,
   and so He purged our sins. He did not come to do something by which our
   sins might be purged, but He purged them effectually, actually, really,
   completely. How did He do it? By His preaching? By His Doctrine? By His
   Spirit? No, "By Himself." Oh, that is a blessed word! The Revised
   Version has left it out, but the doctrine is taught in the Bible over
   and over again. "Who His own Self bore our sins in His own body on the
   tree." "By His own blood He entered in once into the Holy Place, having
   obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of
   goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to
   the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ,
   who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God,
   purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" He gave
   Himself for us! Not only His blood, but all that constituted
   Himself--His Godhead and His Manhood. All that He had and all that He
   was, He gave as the ransom price for us! Can any of you estimate the
   value of that price? The acts of One, Divine as He is, are Divine
   actions, and there is a weight and force about them that there could
   not be about the deeds of the best of men or even of all the holy
   angels! "He by Himself purged our sins."

   Now, let every Believer, if he wants to see his sins, stand on tiptoe
   and look up--will he see them there? No. If he looks down, will he see
   them there? No. If he looks around, will he see them there? No. If he
   looks within, will he see them there? No. Where shall he look, then?
   Where he likes, for he will never see them, again, according to that
   ancient promise, "In those days, and in that time, says the Lord, the
   iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none. And
   the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found, for I will pardon them
   whom I reserve." Shall I tell you where your sins are? Christ purged
   them and God said, "I will cast all their sins behind My back." Where
   is that? All things are before God. I do not know where behind God's
   back can be! It is nowhere, for God is everywhere present, seeing
   everything. So that is where my sins have gone--I speak with the utmost
   reverence when I say that they have gone where Jehovah, Himself, can
   never see them! Christ has so purged them that they have ceased to be!
   The Messiah came to finish transgression and to make an end of sin--and
   He has done it.

   O Believer, if He has made an end of it, [sin] then there is an end to
   it and what more can there be of it? Here is a blessed text for you. I
   love to meditate on it often when I am alone--"As far as the east is
   from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." This
   He did on Calvary's Cross--there effectually, finally, totally,
   completely, eternally, He purged all His people from their sin by
   taking it upon Himself, bearing all its dreadful consequences,
   cancelling and blotting it out, casting it into the depths of the sea
   and putting it away forever! And all this He did, "by Himself." It was,
   indeed, amazing love that made Him stoop to this purgation, this
   expiation, this Atonement for sin! But, because He was who and what He
   was, He did it thoroughly and perfectly! He said, "It is finished," and
   I believe Him! I do not--I cannot--for a moment admit that there is
   anything to be done by us to complete that work--or anything required
   of us to make the annihilation of our sins complete! Those for whom
   Christ died are cleansed from all their guilt--and they may go their
   way in peace. He was made a curse for us, and there is nothing but
   blessing left for us to enjoy!

   III. Now, lastly, I have to speak of WHAT CHRIST NOW ENJOYS. "When He
   had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
   Majesty on high." Here again I shall have to say that I am quite out of
   my depth. I have waters to swim in, but I am not a good swimmer in such
   blessed deeps as these.

   There is an allusion here, no doubt, to the High Priest who, on the
   great Day of Atonement, when the sacrifice had been offered, presents
   himself before God. Now Christ, our great High Priest, having, once and
   for all, offered Himself as the Sacrifice for sin, has now gone into
   the Most Holy Place and there He sits at the right hand of the Majesty
   on high.

   Notice, first, that this implies rest. When the High Priest went within
   the veil, he did not sit down. He stood, with holy trembling, bearing
   the sacrificial blood, before the blazing Mercy Seat. But our Savior
   now sits at His Father's right hand. The High Priest of old had not
   finished his work--the next year another atoning sacrifice would be
   needed! But our Lord has completed His Atonement, and now, "there
   remains no more sacrifice for sin," for there remains no more sin to be
   purged. "But this Man, after He had offered one Sacrifice for sins
   forever, sat down at the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting
   till His enemies be made His footstool. For by one offering He has
   perfected forever them that are sanctified." There He sits and I am
   sure He would not be sitting if He had not finished the salvation of
   His people! Isaiah long before had been Inspired to record what the
   Messiah would say, "For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for
   Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof goes
   forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns."
   But Christ is now resting! My eyes, by faith, can see Him sitting
   there, so I know that--

   "Love's redeeming work is done! Fought the fight, the battle won."
   Notice, next, that Christ sits in the place of honor--"at the right
   hand of the Majesty on high." Of course we are talking figuratively,
   now, and you must not interpret this literally. Jesus sits at the right
   hand of His Father, He dwells in the highest conceivable honor and
   dignity. All the angels worship Him and all the blood-washed host adore
   Him day without night. The Father delights to honor Him--

   "The highest place that Heaven affords Is His, is His by right, The
   King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, And Heaven's eternal Light." Not only
   does Jesus sit in the place of honor, but He occupies the place of
   safety. None can hurt Him, now! None can stop His purposes, or defeat
   His will. He is at the powerful right hand of God! In Heaven above and
   on the earth beneath, and in the waters under the earth, and on every
   star He is supreme Lord and Master. And they that will not yield to Him
   shall be broken with a rod of iron! He shall dash them to pieces like a
   potter's vessel. So His cause is safe, His kingdom is secure, for He is
   at the right hand of Power.

   And, last of all, Christ at the right hand of God signifies the eternal
   certainty of His reward. It is not possible that He should be robbed of
   the purchase of His blood. I tremble when I hear some people talk about
   the disappointed Christ--or about His having died at a chance to
   accomplish He knew not what--dying for something which the will of man
   might give Him if it would, but it might possibly be denied Him! I buy
   nothing on such terms as that! I expect to have what I purchase and
   Christ will have what He bought with His own blood--especially as He
   lives again to claim His purchase! He shall never be a defeated and
   disappointed Savior! "He loved the Church and gave Himself for it." He
   has redeemed His loved ones from among men and He shall have all those
   whom He has purchased. "He shall see of the travail of His soul, and
   shall be satisfied." Therefore, let us again say, "Hallelujah!" and
   fall down and worship Him!

   It does seem to me that there is no proof of men's natural blindness
   that is so conclusive as this, that men will not go and trust in Jesus.
   O Sinners, if sin had left you sane in heart, you would come at once
   and fall down at His feet! There is all power laid up in Jesus and
   there is all the Father's love concentrated in Jesus, so come and trust
   Him! If you will but trust Him, you will prove that He has given
   Himself for you! That simple trust is the secret mark that
   distinguishes His people from all others. "My sheep hear My voice, and
   I know them, and they follow Me." To those who rejected Him when He was
   upon the earth, our Lord said, "You believe not because you are not of
   My sheep, as I said unto you." O poor Souls, do you mean to wear
   forever the damning mark of unbelief? If you die with that brand upon
   your soul, you will be lost forever! Oh, may you have, instead, that
   blessed mark of faith which is the token of the Lord's people! May you
   even now hang out the scarlet line as Rahab hung it out of her
   window--the scarlet line of confidence in the crimson blood of Jesus!
   And while Jericho falls--while all the earth shall crumble in one
   common ruin--your house, though built upon the wall, shall stand
   securely and not one who is within its shelter shall be touched by the
   devouring sword, for all who are in Christ are in everlasting safety!
   How can they be otherwise, since He has purged their sins? God give to
   every one of you a part and lot among this blessed company, for His
   dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EPHESIANS1.

   We frequently read this chapter and the whole of this Epistle because
   it has been well remarked that the Epistle to the Ephesians is a body
   of divinity in miniature. Here all the great Doctrines of the Gospel
   are discussed. Here all the great precepts are laid down for the
   guidance of Believers. He who would understand the theology of Christ
   Jesus should read the Epistle to the Ephesians with great care.

   Verses 1, 2. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to
   the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
   Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father. There must be "Grace"
   first. "Peace" comes afterwards. They seek heavenly blessings in the
   wrong order who try to gain peace, first, and then Grace. "There is no
   peace, says my God to the wicked." And he who has a peace which does
   not acknowledge Grace for its parent has a false peace-- a peace where
   there is no peace! But let us first have Grace in our souls, then shall
   our peace be "as a river, and our righteousness as the waves of the
   sea." Note here, as Luther has said on a corresponding verse in the
   Epistle to the Galatians, the Apostle says, "Grace be to you, and
   peace, from God our Father"--and lest that terrible name should
   frighten us, he has joined there the name of God the Son and sweetly
   put in--

   2. And from the Lord Jesus Christ. We can have nothing to do with an
   absolute God. It is God in Christwhom we love--whom we adore--who alone
   is our Savior!

   3, 4. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
   according as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love. The
   Apostle commences by laying down the great Doctrine of predestinating
   love. There is little Gospel preached where Election is denied. We
   marvel that some of us should be regarded as in error because we preach
   the Doctrine of God's Divine Sovereignty in giving Grace to men
   whereas, in former times, the opponents of that glorious system would
   have been reckoned as the heretics!

   Turn to all the great creeds that are preserved and you shall find that
   Truth of God mentioned. Above all, we can scarcely conceive that any
   person who is a member or a minister of the Established Church and
   finding Divine Election in his own Church's articles, can, in the least
   degree, deny it! It is the glory of that Church [the Church of England]
   that it has a Calvinistic creed and it is so far in harmony with the
   Scriptures!

   5, 6. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ to Himself according to the good pleasure of His will, to the
   praise of the glory of His Grace, wherein He has made us accepted in
   the Beloved. Adoption follows predestination. We were chosen of God
   before time began and the result of that choice is that He puts us into
   His family. In the fifth verse, the Apostle declares that the only
   reason for our adoption, or for our election, rests in the good
   pleasure of God Almighty. There is nothing in man which can merit God's
   regard and when we enter Heaven, we shall even there sing--

   "What was there in me that could merit esteem, Or give the Creator
   delight? 'Twas even so, Father,'I must always sing, 'Because it seemed
   good in Your sight

   Mark here the channel through which all God's mercies run! Jesus Christ
   is the channel through which Grace flows to us. We are chosen in Him,
   we are adopted by Jesus Christ to Himself and we are "accepted in the
   Beloved." It is said of that eminently holy man, Harington Evans, that,
   when near death, he asked his friends to give this message to his
   church. "Tell them," he said, "I am accepted in the Beloved." Can we
   say, my Brothers and Sisters, that we are accepted in the Beloved? Can
   we put our hand upon our heart and, each one, say, "I may not be
   accepted by my fellow creatures. I may not be acknowledged by them and,
   certainly, before my God, I can never be accepted in myself. But in the
   Beloved, clothed with His righteousness, and standing in His Person, as
   a member of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones, I am 'accepted in
   the Beloved'"?

   7-10. In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
   sins, according to the riches of His Grace; wherein He has abounded
   toward us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the
   mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He has
   purposed in Himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times
   He might gather together in one, all things in Christ, both which are
   in Heaven, and which are on earth; even in Him. The main purpose of the
   Gospel is to exalt Christ and to glorify God. We forget God's great
   design if we look only to humanity. If we regard salvation as a means
   of only lifting up our race from its fall and putting it among the
   princes, we have made a mistake. We must remember that God's Glory is a
   greater objective, even, than man's salvation! Not so much to save us
   did God give His Son, as to honor Himself and to glorify that Son of
   His! And we must always remember that the Gospel has for its chief aim
   the glory of all the attributes of the Divine Being. He has determined
   to gather together, at last, all things in Christ that are in Heaven
   and in earth.

   Some foolish persons have wrested this text to prove the absurd
   doctrine of the final restitution of the lost. They have said that even
   the fallen spirits in Hell are to be restored! We find it not in this
   text--we have it particularly said, "things in Heaven and things on
   earth." But there is no mention made of those concerning whom it was
   long ago said, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he
   which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
   him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still." I
   have often thought that these words of the angel are conclusive with
   regard to the eternity of future punishment. Once dead, immutability is
   stamped upon our state--once let us die and our destiny can never be
   changed--

   "There are no acts of pardon passed In the cold grave to which we
   haste. But darkness, death, and long despair, Reign in eternal silence
   there." But "things which are in Heaven, and which are on earth" are,
   "in the dispensation of the fullness of times," to be gathered together
   in one, "even in Him."

   11-14. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
   predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works all things
   after the counsel of His own will: that we should be to the praise of
   His glory, who first trusted in Christ In whom you also trusted, after
   that you heard the Word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation: in whom
   also after that you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
   promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
   of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory. I cannot
   help remarking how continually the Apostle uses such expressions as,
   "in Christ," "in whom," "in Him." He will not have a Doctrine apart
   from Christ! He will not mention a single blessing, or a single mercy,
   without Christ! I believe there is no way of preaching Gospel Doctrines
   truly apart from the Master. In Christ's own days, if you had asked one
   of His followers what he believed, he would not have been long telling
   you! He would not have pointed to 50 Doctrines, but he would have
   pointed to Christ and said, "I believe in Him." You might have asked
   him, 50 times, "But what do you believe?" and he would have replied, "I
   believe in Him! He is, in Himself, the great embodiment of my faith!
   His Person carries within it all the great Doctrines which I receive
   from Him. He is the Truth! I believe Him and I believe in Him." Let us
   learn, then, always to trace our mercies to Christ Jesus, to look upon
   every blessing as being the purchase of His blood and never to ask for
   any mercy, nor endeavor to obtain any blessing, except entirely in
   connection with Him. Let us say to Him--

   "You are the Way, the Truth, the Life!

   Grant us that Way to know,

   That Truth to keep, that Life to win,

   Whose joys eternal flow."

   15. "Therefore I, also, after Iheard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
   andlove unto all the saints. "Whether they live at Ephesus or
   elsewhere, whether they exactly agree with your opinion or not--

   16-23. Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
   prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory,
   may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
   ofHim: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may
   know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory
   of His inheritance in the saints, and what it the exceeding greatness
   of His power to us who believe, according to the working of His mighty
   power, which He worked in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and
   set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all
   principality, andpower, andmight, and dominion, and every name that is
   named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and
   has put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all
   things to the Church, which is His body, the fullness ofHim that fills
   all in all Calvin has a striking remark upon this verse, "the Church is
   the fullness of Christ." "This is the highest honor of the Church that,
   until Christ is united to us, the Son of God reckons Himself, in some
   measure, imperfect." And so He is, for what would a king be without his
   subjects? A mockery! Yes, and all the members of Christ's mystical
   body--the Church--are necessary to make a whole Christ! If the very
   least Believer shall be absent at the last, Christ will not be
   complete. Even the Almighty Son of God will feel a lack within Himself,
   or He would, if it were possible that one of those whom His Father had
   given Him should not at last be found at His right hand! All the sheep
   of the Good Shepherd will be gathered into the heavenly fold! We
   rejoice to know that there is such a connection as this between
   ourselves and Christ! Here is our glory and our boast--and here is our
   trust! We believe that--

   "His honor is engaged to save

   The meanest of His sheep.

   All that His Heavenly Father gave

   His hands securely keep.

   Not death, nor Hell, shall ever remove

   His favorites from His breast!

   In the dear bosom of His love

   They must forever rest"

The Perpetuity of the Gospel

   (No. 2636)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 20, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   28, 1882.

   "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My Words shall not pass away."
   Luke 21:33.

   LAST Lord's-Day morning I preached upon the perpetuity of the Law of
   God, [Sermon #1660, Volume 28-- The Perpetuity of the Law of God]
   basing my remarks upon our Lord's words, "For verily I say unto you,
   Till Heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
   from the Law till all is fulfilled." Tonight, I am not going to speak
   of the Law, but of the Gospel. And, by the term, "the Gospel," I mean
   the summary of all that our Lord Jesus Christ spoke when He was here
   below. Of that Gospel it may be said, as He, Himself, said of the Law,
   that not one jot or tittle of it shall pass away till all is fulfilled.
   The Gospel of Christ is not merely the Gospel of yesterday, but, like
   Christ Himself, it is "the same yesterday, and today, and forever." It
   is not a Gospel simply for this age, or for some other age, a Gospel
   which shall, by-and-by, be worn out and cast aside. But when yon blue
   heavens shall be folded up, like a worn-out vestment, the Gospel shall
   still be as powerful as ever. "Heaven and earth shall pass away," says
   our Lord, "but My Words shall not pass away."

   I. Without further preface, I remark, first, that THE WORDS OF JESUS
   MUST STAND, COME WHAT MAY. If you accept the testimony of Christ
   concerning His own Words--and you who are His followers will not
   question anything that He says--then this is certain, that the Words of
   Jesus must stand forever, come what may.

   The major change of Heaven and earth passing away includes all lesser
   changes, but whatever alteration may come before the last great change,
   Christ's Words shall still stand The world gets more civilized--so I am
   told, though, when I read the newspapers, I am not quite sure of it.
   The world gets more intelligent--so I am told, though, when I read the
   magazines--I mean, the first-class quarterlies--I am not certain that
   it is so, for, in that direction, the ignorance appears to me to become
   greater every day. I mean the ignorance among the learned and
   scientific men, who seem to me, in their discoveries, to wander
   continually further and further, not only from that which is revealed
   and Infallible, but also from that which is rational and truthful.

   But still, the world does alter and, according to its own notion, it is
   getting wonderfully near perfection! Was there ever such a century as
   the nineteenth? Was there ever such a period of time since the world
   began? What is there that we are not doing? Lighting ourselves by
   electricity, speaking by means of the lightning, traveling by
   steam--what an amazing people we are! Yes, yes, and we are going to do
   much greater things than these, no doubt. And many matters which are
   now reckoned as mere dreams will probably because accomplished facts in
   a few generations! But after these marvels have all come and gone, the
   Words of our Lord Jesus Christ will still abide--they will not pass
   away! Fashion follows fashion, systems succeed systems, everything
   beneath the moon is like the moon, it waxes and wanes and is always on
   the change! But come whatever change there may, even if the human race
   should reach that wonderful development which some prophesy for it, yet
   still, the Words of our Lord Jesus Christ shall not pass away. And when
   the greatest alteration of all shall take place and this present
   dispensation shall come to an end--and all material things shall be
   consumed with fire and be destroyed--yet, even then, there shall remain
   above the ashes of the world and all that is therein, the imperishable
   Revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ, for, as Peter says, "The Word of
   the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word which by the Gospel is
   preached unto you."

   Why is it that Christ's Words will last in this way? I answer, first,
   because they are Divine. That which is Divine will endure. All God's
   works will not last forever, but His Words will. He will never retract
   anything that He has said. Even Baalim had Light of God enough to
   declare. "God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man,
   that He should repent: has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He
   spoken, and shall He not make it good?" God has never had, as our
   common saying puts it, to "eat His own words," nor will He! And Christ
   has never had to retract anything that He has uttered. All His life, He
   had not even once to make an apology and say, "I spoke too fast, or too
   warmly, or somewhat inaccurately." Everything that He said has stood
   and shall stand because the Divinity that is in it makes it
   everlasting!

   Again, the Words of Christ must stand because they are the Revelation
   of the innermost heart of God. This great world, and the sun, and moon,
   and stars, reveal God--but not as fully and as clearly as the Son of
   God reveals Him. The Incarnate Word is the most grand manifestation of
   Deity and the Words of that Eternal Word are the Revelation of the
   purpose of God which He formed in His Infinite mind before He made the
   world. That which, in the secret counsels of eternity was planned--that
   which--

   "Ere sin was born, or Satan fell," was devised in the heart of the Most
   High--is revealed to us, as far as it may be revealed, in the Words of
   the Lord Jesus Christ. God's essential purposes cannot be altered--they
   must all be fulfilled. His eternal plan was formed in the foresight of
   all generations that shall exist, so it must stand unchanged and,
   inasmuch as those purposes and that plan are closely connected with the
   Words of Christ and, indeed, are made known to us by His Words,
   therefore the Words of Christ must stand forever.

   Further, the Words of Christ must live even when Heaven and earth have
   passed away because they are pure Truth of God. Everything that is
   absolutely and purely true must be abiding and enduring. See how long
   solid silver lasts. You may buy plated goods for use in your house,
   but, after a time, in the process of wearing you begin to see the baser
   metal underneath. But if you have real silver, hall-marked, it will
   last your lifetime. David truly said, "The Words of the Lord are pure
   words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times."
   Their surface does not wear off and reveal the dross beneath, for there
   is none! All is pure throughout. Impurity breeds decay--error is
   corruption--every evil thing carries within it the seeds of its own
   death. But God's Truth has no corruption in it. It is the living and
   incorruptible Seed which, therefore, lives and abides forever. That
   which is perfectly pure will not ferment because it contains within
   itself no germs of decay. Nor shall it pass away, but it shall live
   forever. Our Lord Jesus Christ spoke nothing but pure, unalloyed
   Truth--the very Truth of God and, therefore, it shall stand fast
   forever.

   And that Christ's Words shall live eternally, we do believe, again,
   because no power can prevent it. What power is there that can prevent
   Christ's Words from being triumphant? Do you hear the roar from the pit
   of Hell as that question is asked? The devil and his legions of fallen
   spirits say that they will prevent the triumph of the Words of Christ
   and, whereas He has declared that His Kingdom shall come, they conspire
   to prevent its coming. But Christ has already broken the head of the
   dragon, He has trampled the old serpent beneath His feet and His
   Omnipotence is greater than Satan's potency. The devil may be mighty,
   but Christ is Almighty, and Hell shall suffer dire defeat at the hand
   of the Crucified Savior! As for the wicked men upon this earth, they
   often league themselves together and take counsel "against the Lord,
   and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and
   cast away their cords from us." You know how futile are all their
   efforts, for the Psalmist says, "He that sits in the heavens shall
   laugh. The Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak to
   them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I set
   My King upon My holy hill of Zion."

   There is no power that can effectually resist the Words of Christ.
   "Where the word of a king is, there is power," but where the Word of
   God is, there is Infinite power! What He says must be done. Before He
   said, "Let there be light," there was not a spark amid all earth's
   gloom that could help to make the day! There was nothing lying here
   that could have created the light and yet the darkness fled before that
   fiat of God! And so, today, if there is nothing on earth to help the
   fulfillment of Christ's Word, He has said to this poor dark world, "Let
   there be light," and that light, which He has kindled, is growing
   brighter and brighter--and shall increase unto the perfect day. O
   devils in Hell, can you blot out that light? Impossible! Christ's Word
   must stand!

   And yet once more, Christ's Word must stand because His honor is
   involved in its permanence. If He had to alter anything He said, it
   would be manifest that He had made mistakes which He must rectify. I
   often get books in which there is a slip of paper containing errata
   fastened at the beginning. They are said to be printers' blunders, but
   I should not wonder if they are also the mistakes of the writer. But
   there they are and I have to take a pencil and make these corrections
   in the volume. There are no errata in the Words of Christ, nor can
   there be any corrections in anything that He has said. David's
   declaration applies to all the Words of Jesus. "The Law of the Lord is
   perfect." Christ's Words are all they should be, no less and no more,
   and cursed shall that man be who shall add to or take from them! There
   cannot be any alteration in them, for that would be to dishonor
   Christ's wisdom. Alteration, indeed! That would make it appear that
   Christ trifled while He was here, or that He said what He must
   necessarily unsay and that He was, after all, but an experimenter as to
   truth, getting as near it as He could and afterwards correcting His
   mistakes, like a physician who does not understand a disease and who
   gives a medicine which drives his patient too far one way, and then
   gives him another drug which brings him back again, but never
   completely cures him! Christ never has to act in that fashion. He knew
   what He meant and He said what He meant--and that which He said, and
   that which He meant shall stand even when, like withered figs that drop
   from the tree the stars shall fall from their places, the sun shall be
   turned into blood and the moon shall become black as a sackcloth of
   hair! It must be so and, therefore, all you who believe in Jesus,
   believe firmly in this double declaration that He has made, "Heaven and
   earth shall pass away, but My Words shall not pass away."

   II. Now, secondly, THIS DECLARATION APPLIES TO ALL CHRIST'S WORDS--not
   merely to some of them, but to all, for it is left with an intentional
   indefiniteness which makes it refer to all that He said--"My Words
   shall not pass away."

   This declaration applies, then, to the Doctrinal teaching of Christ.
   Whatever Doctrine Christ taught, either Himself, personally, or by His
   Apostles guided by the Spirit of God, is definite, distinct, immovable
   Truth of God. There are many ministers, nowadays, who think that they
   must shift their doctrinal landmarks and there are others who have no
   landmarks at all. They believe something, or everything, or nothing--it
   is difficult to tell which--and their common cry is, "We must be
   charitable!" I have known many people who were willing to be charitable
   with other people's money, and I have known others who are charitable
   with Doctrines that are not theirs to give away, for they are Christ's
   Doctrines--but these supposed custodians of them care so little for
   them that they offer to give them away in any quantity! But a faithful
   steward of Christ's Gospel will not do so. He who loves Christ and
   wishes to honor Him, keeps Christ's Words, and treasures them up!

   I have heard of this body of divinity and that, but the body of
   divinity that I believe in is the body of Jesus Christ! And the true
   divinity, the real theology, is that wondrous Logos, the Incarnate Word
   of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! If we will take Jesus, and
   Him, only, to be our Leader, there are a great many ways that we shall
   never go--and there are a great many things which are done by different
   sects of professing Christians which we shall not do, as we cannot see
   that Christ ever did anything of the sort! And if He did not, neither
   will we. That is a good rule for all Christians which I saw in one of
   our Orphanage schoolrooms--"What would Jesus do?" There cannot be a
   better guide than that for Believers, for our text is true with regard
   to Doctrine, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My Words shall not
   pass away." I am often said to be a very old-fashioned, narrow-minded
   sort of person and I have not the slightest objection to the
   accusation. I certainly am not new-fashioned and do not intend to be,
   for "the old is better" and, in theology, there is nothing new that is
   true, and nothing true that is new! The Truth of God is as old as the
   everlasting hills and to that I desire to keep even to the end, and I
   trust that you, also, will be of the same mind.

   Next, we have the Words of Jesus, not only about Doctrine, but He has
   given us plain practical commands. The Master taught a wonderful system
   of ethics and to that system we are to cling with the same tenacity
   that should characterize our hold on the Doctrines that Christ taught.
   Brothers and Sisters, let us never get away from such a Divine teaching
   as this--"I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
   do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
   you and persecute you." Let us not only love one another, but let us
   seek to do good unto all men as we have opportunity, especially to such
   as are of the household of faith. Be it our daily delight to cast out
   all malice and unkindness from our hearts, that the Law of Love may be
   fulfilled in us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
   You may depend upon it that there will never be any improvement upon
   the teaching of Christ! There have been some persons who have tried to
   improve upon it, but they have made a signal failure of all their
   attempts. His ethical teaching--His teaching of morals--has impressed
   even some of those who have not accepted His Doctrines, or even
   believed in His Divinity! They have been astonished at the purity, the
   holiness, the love which Jesus Christ inculcated in the Laws which He
   laid down for the guidance of His disciples.

   But I must press on and remind you that the promises of Christ shall
   stand forever Heaven and earth shall pass away, but His promises shall
   not pass away. Is not that a blessed Truth of God? He said, "Come unto
   Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
   Come along with you, then, poor laboring and heavy laden Souls, for He
   will give you rest! Heaven and earth shall pass away, but He will give
   you rest if you come to Him. And He has said, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." Come along with you, then! Obey both His
   commands--first, believe, and then be baptized, for, though Heaven and
   earth shall pass away--you shall be saved! There are many things which
   may be but actions. Like the phantom visions of a night, they may
   dissolve, but you shall be saved, that is a sure thing, that is certain
   beyond all question! The Lord Jesus has promised such great things to
   His people that I could keep you here all night if I were to try to
   repeat those gracious Words of promise which streamed out of His lips!
   Here is one of the sweetest of them--"All that the Father gives Me
   shall come to Me; and he that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."
   If you come to Him, He will not in any wise cast you out! He must, He
   will receive you! Heaven and earth may pass away, and they shall pass
   away in due time, but never shall a soul that comes to Jesus be
   rejected by Him! Oh, that many of you would avail yourselves of that
   promise this very hour!

   Dear aged Friend, you are getting very feeble and you have passed
   through a great many changes, but that promise has not been altered all
   the while! Do you recollect when your mother told you about Christ when
   you were a curly-headed boy? "Ah," you say, "it is too late, now!" No,
   my dear Friend, no! Heaven and earth have not passed away yet, and that
   promise has not passed away--you may still come to Christ, so come and
   welcome, for it is still written, "He that comes to Me I will in no
   wise cast out." "He is able, also, to save them to the uttermost that
   come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession for
   them." Trust His promise even now! Bow your head in the pew and
   silently seek the Ever-Blessed One and He will be found of you, for His
   Word is as sure to you as it was to me--as sure to you as it has been
   to tens of thousands who, in different times, have tried it and found
   that promise true!

   But remember, also, that as every Word of promise from Christ shall
   stand, so shall every Word of prophecy. There is a whole Book of
   Revelation which I do not understand, but which I fully believe. I am
   very glad to find something in the Bible which I cannot comprehend, but
   which I may believe, for I do not call that faith which limits its
   belief to what it can understand. If you have any little children, you
   delight to see the way in which they trust you when they cannot make
   out what you are doing, though they are sure that you are doing right.
   I want you, dear Friends, to have just that kind of faith in the Book
   of Revelation--it is all true, although you cannot interpret all its
   mysteries. And it will all come true--every word of it--in God's good
   time! The Lord shall come, the Lord shall reign, the Lord shall judge,
   the Lord shall justify and glorify His people--and the Lord shall bid
   the ungodly depart from Him under the curse. I pray that we may all be
   helped to believe every Word of it.

   When I read the Bible, I like to read it in the spirit of the little
   boy whose mother told him something, but his schoolmates laughed at him
   for believing it. They asked him how he knew that it was true and he
   said that his mother told him so, and his mother never told a lie. They
   tried to prove that it could not be so, but he said, "Look here, my
   mother said so, and it is so if it isn't so." And if I find anything in
   the Word of God--and somebody with wonderful wisdom tells me that it
   cannot be so, he is quite sure of it--I laugh his "cannots" into
   oblivion and reply--"It is so if it isn't so! Your supposed proof is
   nothing to me! If God has said it, and all the tongues that ever wagged
   should deny it, I would still say, 'Let God be true and every man a
   liar.'" Hold then, dear Friends, to the Words of Christ even though you
   do not always understand them.

   I must also remind you that every Word of threats that Jesus Christ has
   spoken is true. Oh, that we could have seen His face and heard the very
   tones of His voice! There must have been an inexpressible sweetness and
   an ineffable tenderness about the speech of Jesus Christ. All those who
   heard Him speak knew that He loved them. And the publicans and sinners,
   the poor pariahs, the off-casts, those who were scorned by everybody
   else, drew near to hear Him because they felt that there was sympathy
   towards them in that great heart of His. Yet, did you ever notice--you
   must have noticed it, that never man spoke such terrible words of
   threatening to the ungodly as this Man spoke? It was Jesus who spoke of
   the worm that never dies and of the fire that never shall be quenched!
   It was Jesus who spoke of destroying both body and soul in Hell! It was
   He who said many of the most terrible things about future punishment
   that were ever uttered, such as that parable of the rich man who "died
   and was buried; and in Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments,
   and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and
   said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may
   dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am
   tormented in this flame."

   When you hear men trying to soften down the threats of the Scriptures,
   do not believe that love to souls suggests such a course of action--it
   often is the proof of true love that it can speak harsh things! If a
   man comes and tells you very pleasant things about yourself, beware of
   him--he is not your friend! But the man who can warn you, who can point
   out your fault and your folly--who can run the risk of losing your
   esteem by indicating your danger--that is the one who has a sincere
   affection for you! And a wise man will choose such a friend as that.
   Whatever anyone may think or say, there is not a terrible Word that
   ever fell from the Savior's lips which will not stand! Though you do
   not like it, you cannot alter it--it will not be selected by your likes
   or dislikes. "He that believes not shall be damned." You call that a
   hard saying? Regardless, it is true, or Christ would not have said it.
   It must have cost Him much inward anguish to utter such a sentence as
   that! It must have been a sort of mental crucifixion to Him to speak as
   He did about the terrors of the world to come. And you can be you sure
   that they are not less awful than He described, not less horrible than
   He depicted them! So, whatever any may say by way of toning down His
   threats, reject their lies, for Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
   the Words of Christ shall not pass away.

   III. Thirdly, and lastly, I want to show you that THIS TRUTH HAS A
   BEARING UPON US ALL.

   First, I am sure that it has a relation to the preacher. My text
   innately concerns me and all who are called to be ministers of the
   Gospel. Dear Brothers, we have to preach the same Gospel that our Lord
   Jesus Christ preached, and no other. I am thankful that I do not know
   any other Gospel. Long ago I came to Paul's resolve and, "I determined
   not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."
   I stick to that, and that is what all of us must do if we would please
   our Master! There is no progression in the Truth of God, itself. We
   progress in our knowledge of what Christ said, and in our understanding
   of it, but the Truths that He uttered remain just the same as they were
   in His days. You know that when your little children go down to the
   seaside, they build tiny castles and houses, and make gardens in the
   sand--but they are all washed away when the tide rolls over them. I
   should not like to preach a theology of the kind that is being
   constantly washed away, leaving me to start afresh with some more sand.

   The Eddystone Lighthouse has stood gloriously, and the reason why
   another has to be built is because the rock has given way under it--the
   lighthouse, itself, is all right. We thank God that when we build upon
   what Christ says, we build on a Rock that will not give way under us!
   And if we are as steadfast as the old lighthouse, and not a stone of us
   will stir, we shall be perfectly justified by the equal steadfastness
   of that Truth of God upon which we build! There is no stirring that
   rock which is formed of what Christ said. The earth may not only quake,
   but melt. And the unpillared vault of Heaven that has stood so firm
   these many ages--even it shall come down with a crash! But no Word of
   Jesus Christ shall ever be dissolved or pass away! We must stick to the
   old Gospel, then. It sufficed for our fathers and our grandfathers, and
   it will suffice for our grandchildren if the world stands so long as to
   see them also grow up to preach it!

   This text also has a bearing upon Church members, especially upon you
   very timid souls who, now and then, get afraid that everything good is
   coming to an end. I meet with some dear old souls, of both sexes, who
   are very nervous about what is coming to pass. They are afraid that
   dreadful times are coming. Yes, no doubt they are, but there is a
   sinful timidity which does dishonor to the power and Truth of God.
   There have always been, in all ages, some Latimers and Luthers who had
   no fear for God's Truth. People complained that they were very dogmatic
   but they did not care what was said about them--they were probably just
   as happy whatever the world said!

   Luther had one very special friend among the German princes and someone
   asked the Reformer, "Suppose that he should withdraw his protection
   from you, where would you hide?" "Beneath the broad shield of Heaven,"
   he answered. And Luther spoke wisely. He would not feel that he was
   dependent upon any man, but upon God alone. I wish, my poor trembling
   Friend, that you had something of his holy courage. Do not get into
   that doubting state of mind again! Heaven and earth shall pass away, so
   wait till you see them all going! And when they do go, just sit still
   and sing--

   "Then should the earth's old pillars shake, And all the wheels of
   nature break, Our steady souls should fear no more, Than solid rocks
   when billows roar."

   But, next, our text has a bearing on all Believers. Dear Friends, if
   Christ's Words shall never pass away, let us believe them to be true to
   ourselves. Are any of you persecuted? Do not give way for a single
   moment! Stand to your colors! Never be ashamed to acknowledge your
   Lord. Remember how He said, "Who are you, that you should be afraid of
   a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as
   grass; and forget the Lord your Maker, who has stretched forth the
   heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and has feared
   continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he
   were ready to destroy?" Hold you to Christ, whose Words shall never
   pass away.

   Are you very sick and weak, or are you getting very poor? Well, your
   health and your property, too, will pass away, but Christ's Words will
   never pass away. Are you dying? Christ's Words will never die or pass
   away--die with them in your heart! When I went, last week, to see one
   of the members of this Church who is very ill, I had a little of my own
   teaching given back to me. This dear Brother said to me, "Do you
   remember saying to us, years ago, 'What time I am afraid, I will trust
   in You,' is a third-class carriage, but it is in the Gospel train, and
   it will take you to Heaven"? And you added, "Why do you not go in the
   first-class carriage--'I will trust, and not be afraid'?" I commend
   that first-class carriage to all of you! "I will trust, and not be
   afraid." Let faith expel fear and so travel to Heaven first-class! You
   well may do so, for there is no cause to be afraid.

   If any of the Words of Christ could pass away with this wind, and that
   wind, and the other wind, oh, dear, what a card-house we would live in!
   But if they all stand firmly forever--as they do--then why and,
   therefore, should we indulge the slightest fear? One reason why some of
   you do not rest in Christ as you should is because you do not get right
   down flat on to His Words and trust wholly to them. You know what the
   slave said when his master asked him why he was so confident about
   salvation. He answered, "Massa, you try to stand, but Sam fall flat
   down on de promise, and when he is flat down on de promise, he can't
   fall any lower." Just so! Then fall flat on the promise and if you lie
   there, clinging and resting there, alone, then Heaven and earth shall
   pass away, but not the Words on which you are trusting!

   Now, last of all, this is a word to sinners. What a message my text has
   for those of you who do not love Christ, those of you who are
   undecided! Christ's Words shall not pass away--what then? This is the
   only Gospel that you will ever hear--the last train is about to start.
   If you do not go by that, there is no other that will carry you to
   Heaven, "for there is no other name under Heaven given among men,
   whereby we must be saved." The Gospel will never change its character.
   Are any of you waiting till it does, like the countryman who said he
   would cross the river when all the water had run by? There will never
   be any easier way to Heaven than there is at this moment! I verily
   believe that some people, by delay, make the road to Heaven harder for
   themselves than it would otherwise be. If they are ultimately saved, it
   is more difficult for them to trust to Christ when they have been long
   delaying. Even mercy seems, sometimes, to act like Benjamin Franklin
   did when a man came into his shop to buy a book, but wasted the
   bookseller's time by his foolish delay. The man asked, "What is the
   price of this book, Sir?" "Four shillings," said Franklin. "It is
   rather high," said the man, "I will not take it." He waited about ten
   minutes and then he asked, "What now, really, will you take for that
   book?" "Five shillings," said Franklin. "No," said the customer, "you
   asked only four shillings just now." Franklin replied, "Sir, you have
   taken up ten minutes of my time attending to you, so that makes the
   price of the book one shilling more. It is five shillings, now, but if
   you do not buy it quickly, it will be more." There was some common
   sense in that mode of dealing! And you will truly find, in spiritual
   matters, that there is nothing gained by delay. But there isincreased
   sin, increased hardness of heart and even an increased difficulty in
   yielding the soul to Christ!

   The best time for any of you to come to Jesus is just now! You can
   never have a fairer opportunity than that which lies before you at the
   present moment. I am sure of it, because God's wisdom always picks the
   best opportunity--and what does God's wisdom say? "Today if you will
   hear His voice, harden not your hearts." And yet again, "Behold, now is
   the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation." If Christ's
   Words are to stand, there will be no other Gospel ever presented to
   you. If Christ's Words are to stand, why should you delay? Sometimes,
   when I have been returning from preaching away from here, I have seen
   people outside the theater as I have gone by, quite a crowd of them,
   and I have asked a friend why they were waiting. "Oh," he has answered,
   "they are expecting to get in at half price." Well, now, you cannot
   expect anything of that kind in the matter of salvation, for the
   original charge is "without money and without price," and it never can
   be any lower than it is now! Then why not come at once?

   I came to Jesus Christ when I was 15 years of age and I wish I had come
   to Him 15 years before if it had been possible. Oh, that I should ever
   have lived a single minute without the sweet knowledge of salvation by
   Jesus Christ! It is not a thing to be put off! God grant that you may
   no longer put it off! You have done too much of that already, so make
   haste and come to Christ this very moment!

   Let me earnestly entreat you not to be looking out for some larger
   possible hope that may reach you after death. That is a terrible
   delusion! I pray you, risk not your soul upon it! Heaven and earth
   shall pass away, but Christ's Words shall not pass away and, as I have
   already reminded you, He has said, "He that believes not shall be
   damned." And so he will be and there is nothing but that awful doom for
   him. You have your choice. If you trust in Christ, you shall have
   eternal glory. If you will not have Christ as your Savior, you shall
   have everlasting punishment. There is no other hope for you. I pray God
   to lead you to come to Christ at once. Oh, that you would not hesitate,
   since He invites you! Oh, that you would not tarry, since that were to
   insult Him! May His blessed Spirit now compel you to come in, that the
   house of His mercy may be filled! All you have to do is to trust Him!
   You have not to be doers until frstyou have trusted to what He has
   done. Then He will make you doers! Come empty! Come sinful! Come
   hard-hearted! Come just as you are! Tarry not to cleanse or mend, but,
   just as you find yourself, rest on Jesus! Fall flat on His promise!
   Depend upon the merit of His blood and the power of His ever-living
   plea! God help you, now, to do this, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALMS 20,21.

   The 20th Psalm is a prayer for the King--not only for David or Solomon,
   but for "great David's greater Son"--the true King of the Church. As if
   the Church saw Jesus going forth to His work, she offers up a prayer
   for Him.

   Psalm 20:1. The LORD hear you in the day of trouble; the name of the
   God of Jacob defend you. And so it came to pass, in that dread night in
   Gethsemane, Jesus "was heard in that He feared." The God of wrestling
   Jacob heard the cries of His dear Son and defended Him, or supported
   Him, as it is in the marginal reading.

   2. Send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion.
   And you know how there came, from yonder heavenly Jerusalem, an angel
   strengthening Him. The celestial messenger stood at His side amid the
   gloom of the olive garden and brought Him comfort and succor from God's
   right hand--

   "His earnest prayers, His deepening groans Were heard before angelic
   thrones. Amazement wrapped the sky! 'Go, strengthen Christ!' the Father
   said! The astonished seraph bowed his head And left the realms on
   high."

   3. Remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah.
   And so He did. There was never such acceptance given to any burnt
   sacrifice as was given to our Divine Lord when He offered up Himself!

   4. Grant you according to your own heart, and fulfill all your counsel.
   Is it not written, "Prayer also shall be made for Him continually; and
   daily shall He be praised"? Here, then, is a suitable prayer for you to
   present on behalf of the Lord Jesus--that God would grant Him according
   to His own heart and fulfill all His counsel!

   5. We will rejoice in your salvation. Come, Brothers and Sisters, let
   us make this verse true! And even if we have anything to sigh over, let
   us lay it aside while we now devote ourselves to the happy work of
   rejoicing in the glorious salvation of our Lord and King!

   5-9. And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD
   fulfill all your petitions. Now know I that the LORD saves His
   anointed; He will hear him from His holy Heaven, with the saving
   strength of His right hand. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:
   but we willremember the name of the LORD our God. They are brought down
   and fallen: but we are risen and stand upright. Save, LORD: let the
   king hear us when we call What a blessing it is that our King hears us
   when we call upon Him! He is full of sympathy with all His people, for,
   in the time of His sojourn on earth, He often knew what it was to plead
   with His Father. And as God heard Him, then, so does He, Himself, hear
   us. All glory be to His blessed name! The 21st Psalm views the King as
   having ended his battle and achieved his victory.

   Psalm 21:1, 2. The king shall joy in Your strength, O LORD; andin Your
   salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! You have given him his heart's
   desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah God gave
   to Jesus the strength needed to accomplish the work which He came to do
   and He is daily giving Him to see of the travail of His soul that He
   may be satisfied.

   3. For you meet him with the blessings of goodness. They go before Him
   like scouts or forerunners! Wherever Jesus comes, the blessings of
   goodness fly before Him to the sons of men.

   3. You set a crown of pure gold on his head. Let us crown Him afresh,
   tonight, with our poor garlands of praise, while God sets a crown of
   pure gold upon His head!

   4. He askedlife of You, and You gave it to him, even length of days
   forever and ever. And because He lives, we shall also live! The Father
   has given Him to have life in Himself and hence He communicates that
   life to us who believe in Him.

   5. His glory is great in Your salvation: honor and majesty have You
   laid upon him. Heaped it on Him. There is no one so worthy of honor as
   our Lord Jesus is! None are so majestic as the Man of Sorrows who once
   bowed His head to death on His people's behalf.

   6. For You have made him most blessed forever: You have made Him
   exceedingly glad with Your Countenance. The Father rewards Him for all
   His service--"You have made Him most blessed forever." We cannot
   imagine how great is the joy of Christ as His Father smiles upon
   Him--"You have made Him exceedingly glad with Your Countenance."

   7. 8. For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the mercy of the
   Most High he shall not be moved. Your hand shall find out all Your
   enemies. Oh, what a wonderful prophecy that is! Christ's hand shall
   find out all His enemies. If they hide themselves, He shall discover
   them. If they cover themselves with chain armor, yet still His hand
   will find out their vulnerable parts and touch their very souls until
   they melt with fear! "Your hand shall find out all Your enemies." Are
   there any of these enemies of Christ here, tonight? If so, not only
   will His eyes find them out, but His hands will find them out, too.

   8-13. Your right handshall find out those that hate You. You shallmake
   them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger: the LORD shall swallow
   them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shall
   You destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of
   men. For they intended evil against You: they imagined a mischievous
   device which they are not able to perform. Therefore shall You make
   them turn their back, when You shall make ready Your arrows upon Your
   strings against the face of them. Be you exalted, LORD, in Your own
   strength: so will we sing and praise Your power

The Place of Prayer and Pardon

   (No. 2637)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 27, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE 1,
   1882.

   "Whatever burden or whatever sickness there is: then what prayer or
   what supplication shall be made of any man, or of all Your people
   Israel, when everyone shall know his own burden and his own grief, and
   shall spread forth his hands in this house: then hear You from Heaven,
   Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according
   unto all his ways, whose heart You know (for You, only, know the hearts
   of the children of men)." 2 Chronicles 6:28-30.

   THE Temple was intended to be the center of prayer for all the children
   of Israel. Those who could do so went up to it a certain number of
   times every year. Others, who were too far away to go, prayed with
   their window open towards Jerusalem, for there was the Mercy Seat and
   beneath the wings of the overshadowing cherubim there dwelt that bright
   light of the Shekinah which was the index of the Presence of God in the
   midst of His people. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that when
   Solomon dedicated to the Lord the Temple which he had built, his great
   petition was that God would hear every prayer that should be offered in
   that place or toward that place! He wished the Temple to always be to
   Israel the token that God's memorial is that He hears prayer. Solomon
   therefore presented a wonderfully comprehensive series of supplications
   in which he appears to have included all the sorrowful conditions of
   the nation and all the troubles that were likely to fall upon the
   chosen people.

   But this part of his prayer, which we are now to consider, seems as
   though it were intended to gather up anything that the suppliant might
   possibly have left out. We always think that we are among the great
   things--that we are out upon the deep seas--when we can get among the
   "whatevers." "Whatever burden or whatever sickness there is: then what
   prayer or what supplication shall be made of any man, or of all Your
   people Israel...then hear You from Heaven, Your dwelling place, and
   forgive." It is a sort of miscellaneous sentence, taking up all the
   stragglers--the lots that are out of the catalog--those that could not
   be placed under any distinct head. And they are here put under the
   general description of the "whatevers," that every man whatever, who
   should know his own burden and his own grief, and the plague of his own
   heart, should turn his eye and his prayer toward Jerusalem--and that
   God should then hear him and forgive him.

   We have no sacred spot now, Beloved Friends, towards which we turn when
   we pray. The Ritualists talk a great deal about the importance of "the
   eastward position," but I believe that any other position in the
   world--westward, southward, or northward--is just as good and that we
   may pray to God with equal acceptance whichever way we turn. Cow-per
   truly sings--

   "Jesus, wherever Your people meet, There they behold Your Mercy Seat!
   Wherever they seek You, You are found, And everyplace is hallowed
   ground."

   Yet we have a Temple into which they cannot enter who think the mere
   materialistic building is the all-important matter, just as we have an
   Altar to which they have no right to approach so long as they are
   content with the visible and the external. Our Temple is the Person of
   the Lord Jesus Christ--"In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
   bodily." When we pray, we turn our faces toward Him. He said to the
   Pharisees, "In this place is One greater than the Temple," and so He
   is. Though He is to us of the same use as the Temple was to Israel, yet
   is He infinitely more precious and far greater than the Temple and
   whoever, whatever his trouble shall be, shall pray unto God with his
   face toward Jesus, looking to the matchless wounds by which He has
   redeemed us, or the glorified Person in which He represents us, and
   invokes intercession for us before the Throne of God on high, he shall
   be helped, he shall be forgiven, whatever his trouble or whatever his
   sin!

   I. So, coming to the text, I shall, first of all, deal with the fact
   that EACH MAN HAS, OR WILL HAVE, SOME KIND OF GRIEF AND SORROW.

   I may have some in this congregation, who can say, "We have no grief.
   We have no trouble." Well, if that is the case, I am not sure that I
   can congratulate you, though I am very glad when all God's children are
   happy in the Lord, and can joy and rejoice in His name. I pray that
   they may always do so, for I remember how Paul said, "Rejoice in the
   Lord always." Surely that was enough, yet he added, "and again I say,
   Rejoice." You cannot be too happy in the Lord! And whenever you meet
   others who are of a doubtful or troubled spirit, do not imitate them,
   though, I pray you, do not despise them! They may be, on the whole, in
   a better spiritual state than you are, although they are not better
   than you are as to their present difficulty. "The joy of the Lord is
   your strength," and it is an excellent thing for a child of God to be
   happy and joyful in his Savior. Yet I should not wonder, dear Friend,
   that the day may come when you, whose eyes are brightest and whose
   steps are most elastic, will yet find that you shall have trouble in
   the flesh and, perhaps, trouble in the spirit, too, even as it was with
   those to whom the Apostle Peter wrote, "Though now for a season, if
   need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations," or trials.
   Not only do we have manifold trials, but we get into heaviness through
   them. It does happen to many of the best of God's servants that they
   have their sorrow and grief. Just lately I have seen several persons
   who, I am persuaded, love the Lord and the Lord loves them--they are
   very precious to Him-- humble, gentle, gracious people, but they have
   come into deep trouble, or some heavy cloud rests upon them. It is to
   them, especially, that I am now speaking.

   Dear troubled Friend, you may have a grief or sorrow that is not known
   to anybody but yourself You would not like to reveal it to anyone, you
   would not whisper it in the ear of the dearest confidant that you have
   on earth. You keep it to yourself and, perhaps, that is the very reason
   why it becomes so bitter to you. The communicating of it to some
   Christian friend might be a real help to you. You know what a relief it
   is to be able to shed tears when you are in great anguish. If you can
   have a good cry, you can get over the trouble more easily, but,
   sometimes, you cannot find expression for the grief and so the pent-up
   flame becomes more fierce than otherwise it would have been.

   Well, there are children of God of that sort, just like Hannah, the
   woman of a sorrowful spirit, whose adversary sorely vexed her to make
   her fret. And even when she went up to the House of the Lord, it was in
   bitterness of soul that she stood there and prayed unto the Most High.
   I do not think that she could have told anybody, except possibly her
   husband, what the great grief of her heart was and, dear Friend, if you
   have a grief that you cannot tell to any human being, let my text
   affectionately invite you to look toward Jesus, the Temple of this
   dispensation, and tell the Lord all about your sorrow and ask Him to
   give you help, in this, your time of need.

   It may be that your trouble, though it is known to others, is
   misunderstood. It is a very grievous thing when the affliction of God's
   people is misread, misinterpreted and others say, "Oh, nonsense! There
   is nothing to it!" Or else they say, "You are only making a rod for
   your own back. You might help yourself, if you liked, and get out of
   that sad state of mind." You know how the exhortation to "make an
   effort" is often given when all possibility of effort from within has
   long since passed away! And it is a very grievous thing when those whom
   we love utterly misunderstand us. They seem to read our words
   backwards. So far from having any sympathy with us, they are not able
   to enter into our secret sorrow. Alas for the child of God who is in
   that sad condition! But if you are thus troubled--if you know the
   plague of your own heart, but nobody else knows why you are so
   plagued--if you feel your own burden, but nobody else can see it, go to
   Jesus and tell Him of your inward grief. Open the door of your heart
   and let Him inspect all your being and ask Him for the gracious
   forgiveness which is the sweetest balm for your wounds. And then pray
   for a visitation of His blessed Spirit as the Comforter, that your
   heart may rejoice and be glad in Him.

   Possibly, dear Friend, I may be speaking to you who have a grief which
   is not only unknown, or if known, is misunderstood, but to you who are
   lonesome in your sorrow. As far as you can tell, nobody ever before
   went the way which you are now treading. When I have preached,
   sometimes, to the despondent and the despairing, I have been thankful
   when, afterwards, persons have come to me and said that my sermon was
   the first ray of comfort they had ever received. I therefore try to
   practice Mr. Wesley's plan of firing low. He meant by it, speaking
   plainly, so as to hit the groundlings, but while I endorse that view of
   the expression, I mean also another--not to shoot high where only some
   soaring professors may be, but to fire low, where the poor and needy
   are lying on their faces before God! I want to preach so that those who
   are ready to perish may come to Christ and that those who never before
   had a hope may begin to hope in Him. My dear Friend, if you are the
   only one who ever traveled along that rough road, and if you even think
   that you have no equal in your misery, but sit alone in your sorrow,
   yet are you bid to turn your face towards Christ, your Temple, and
   whatever may be your case, to tell it all to Him. And as Jesus lives,
   He will hear and answer you, and you shall yet go your way in peace!

   I do not know what may be the peculiarities of your case. "The heart
   knows his own bitterness and a stranger does not intermeddle with his
   joy." There are depths and there are heights where we must be alone.
   There are some griefs that we must keep to ourselves, as there are some
   raptures and experiences of which, if we were to tell them, men would
   say that we were fanatical and suspect that we were out of our mind! Do
   not be surprised, therefore, if you have sometimes to sail alone, so
   far as any human beings are concerned. If Christ is in the vessel with
   you, you cannot need any better company.

   This grief of yours, my dear Friend, may be connected with some sin, or
   if not actually so, you may think it is. You may have lost the Light of
   God's Countenance by some omission, or by walking at a distance from
   Him. It may be that you have been negligent in prayer. Or, possibly,
   there may have been some sin of commission--perhaps you have yielded to
   temptation and, therefore, it is that you are made to walk in the dark.
   Well, if it is so, do not let even that sad state prevent your coming
   to Jesus with your burden, for He has not only come to help us in our
   troubles, but to save us from our sins! "If any man sins, we have an
   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the
   propitiation for our sins." Do not, therefore, think that when you have
   sinned, you are shut out from the Savior. No, but there is "a fountain
   opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for
   sin and for uncleanness"--open on purpose to cleanse them from sin and
   impurity!

   Paul wrote to the Galatians that our Lord Jesus Christ "gave Himself
   for our sins," upon which passage, Martin Luther observes that Christ
   never gave Himself for our righteousness! There was never enough of
   that to be worth His doing so, but He gave Himself for our sins, that
   He might put them away from us forever. Come, then, though a sense of
   guilt should put a sting into your sorrow which otherwise it would not
   possess. And though you may truly say, "I brought all this misery upon
   myself, I know I did. I played the fool, exceedingly, and now the
   mischief is done and cannot be undone," yet remember that there is One
   who can lift the load off your spirit and say to you, "Go in peace!
   Your sins, which are many, are all forgiven you." Look toward the
   Temple, even to Christ in whom God dwells, and from whom God shines!
   Tell Him your grief and you shall yet rejoice in the peace which He
   delights to bestow.

   "Ah," says one, "I am glad to hear this good news, for the sake of
   others, but my case is a peculiarly trying one, for I have been in this
   sad state of mind for many years." Yes, and how long was that daughter
   of Abraham bowed down so that she could by no means lift up herself?
   Was it not 18 years? Yet how long did it take Christ to make her
   upright? Why, not a moment! He spoke and she became straight at once,
   and able to walk like other women! You remember, also, that the
   impotent man had been waiting at the pool of Bethesda 38 years and the
   "high Doctrine" folk of that day told him to keep on waiting at the
   pool. But when Jesus Christ came round that way, He did not tell him to
   wait a minute, but He said, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk." And he
   did so in an instant!

   You, poor troubled Soul, need not continue to lie at the pool! You need
   not wait there a single moment more! Trust in Christ, who comes to you
   in all your inability, in all your sinfulness, in all your depression
   of spirit, in all your despair and who says to you, "Live. I have loved
   you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness have I
   drawn you." "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth:
   for I am God, and there is none else." "Come now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." These are glorious Words of Grace! May the Lord speak them home
   to your heart even now! The devil himself cannot hold a man in
   captivity when once Christ gives him liberty! Though his feet are made
   fast in the stocks, and it is the dead hour of midnight, yet shall he
   begin to sing praises unto God! And his fellow prisoners shall hear him
   when Jesus of Nazareth passes by and gives him the gracious Word which
   makes him free! Christ crucified is your only hope! Therefore, turn
   your eyes to Him. By faith, look to those dear wounds of His. From your
   inmost soul, breathe your penitent prayer to Him and He will grant you
   the desire of your heart, even life forevermore!

   II. Secondly, IF WE HAVE A GRIEF OR SORROW, IT IS WELL TO KNOW IT, for
   Solomon here speaks "of any man, or of all Your people Israel, when
   everyone shall know his own burden and his own grief."

   In visiting the sick, lately, I have been struck with the different
   ways in which the children of men are afflicted. There is one of our
   Beloved Brothers who is covered with blisters from head to foot.
   Another is lying in a critical condition through congestion of the
   lungs. There is another gradually melting away with consumption, while
   cancer is eating out the very life of yet another friend. Now, just as
   it is with the pangs of the body, so is it with the diseases of the
   mind and the soul. They are of various kinds and though they may be
   arranged under different heads, there is no one spiritual burden or
   sorrow exactly like another and, therefore, it is well for every man to
   know his own burden and his own grief. My faults are not exactly the
   same as yours and yours, probably, are not quite like mine. That which
   greatly grieves me might never trouble you if you had it, while that
   which worries and troubles you might be a thing which I could laugh at
   if it came to me. We must never judge one another, nor may we wish to
   have other people's sorrows and griefs, but we must try, as far as we
   can, to know, every man, his own burden and his own grief.

   For, first, sometimes to know your grief, is to get rid of it It is the
   unknown that is often the most terrible. Belshaz-zar, when his knees
   knocked together, was frightened because he saw the part of the hand
   that wrote upon the wall, but he did not see the form of the writer,
   nor could he tell what was written. It was the mystery of the thing
   that troubled him and, sometimes, when you do not know what your
   trouble is, it is more of a trial to you than when you can get it into
   a definite shape. It is a grand thing to be able to look at it, to
   measure it, to take stock of it, to write down, in black and white,
   what it is that is worrying you. If you do that, you will probably say
   to yourself, "How foolish I am to let this be a trouble to me at all!"
   And sometimes, on the other hand, you will find yourself foolish in
   another sense. After Christian and Hopeful had been shut up in the
   dungeon in Giant Despair's Castle for several days and nights,
   Christian said to his companion, "What a fool I am, thus to lie in a
   stinking dungeon when I may as well walk at liberty! I have a key in my
   bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded, open any lock in
   Doubting Castle." We may find ourselves saying just the same thing! We
   shall look at our trouble till we shall exclaim, "Why, blessed be God,
   there is a promise in His Word which exactly meets this difficulty! God
   the Holy Spirit has left on record the message that is just adapted to
   this very trial! Therefore, why do I lie moaning and groaning in this
   dungeon, when I might at once walk out into Gospel liberty?" So I say
   to you, Beloved, seek to know what your burden or your grief really is,
   for it is the unknown that is usually filled with terrors.

   It is, too, the undiscovered, often, that is the most dangerous. As I
   have already said, our sorrows are oftentimes connected with our sins.
   It is a terrible thing to have a sin festering in your soul and to not
   know it. If a man tells me that he has no sin, I ask him to look
   within, or even to look without upon his own life. But if he thinks
   that he is perfect there, let him keep on looking within. And if he
   does not discover something evil there, it must be because an awful
   blindness has fallen upon him! Often there is sin connected with our
   trouble--and it is most important for us to see it and to know it. I
   think that it was St. Francis de Sales who said that, among all those
   who came to him confessing their sins, not one ever confessed to being
   covetous. And it is a curious thing that, as a rule, no covetous man
   ever believes that he is covetous. Covetousness is a most deceitful
   thing! Pray God to point it out to you if it is within your heart, lest
   it should destroy you! A man may be in such a state of soul that the
   scarlet fever of pride may be killing him and yet, all the while, he
   may be thinking, "What a humble person I am!" For pride is another of
   the most deceptive sins. Every man should try to know what his own
   weakness is. Perhaps the very point in which you think you are the
   strongest is that in which you are really weakest. And the thing which
   does not trouble you in the least may, after all, be that which ought
   to cause the greatest searching of heart. Do pray the Lord, each one of
   you, to cause you to know your own burden and your own grief.

   Remember that if there is sin mixed with our sorrow, it ought not only
   to be known, but to be so known as to be confessed. Oh, what an
   easement to the soul it is when you can confess your sin to the Lord! I
   would have you do it distinctly in the most plain words possible. Do
   not attempt to cloak the matter before God, for you cannot hide
   anything from Him. Remember how David, at last, prayed God to deliver
   him from blood-guiltiness. He was on the right road to getting rest in
   his soul when he could confess his great crime like that! I have heard
   of one who was a child of God, but he was grievously overtaken when, in
   company, he drank too much. He could not get any peace of mind for
   months until he said, "Lord, I was drunk." And after he had put it in
   that way, he found forgiveness, peace and rest. No doubt, before that,
   he had said, "I am afraid I was a little imprudent," or used some of
   those pretty phrases which people employ as a cloak for their
   wrong-doing when they will not confess the evil in all its nakedness
   and deformity. Away with the fig leaves! God abhors them! It is Hewho
   must clothe you! And He will do so with the righteousness of His Son.
   But, if He is to accept you, there must be no attempt to lighten your
   guilt. Let sin be called sin and, in the Presence of Christ--

   "Sin does like itself appear,"

   and the sinner sees its heinousness and learns to hate it. So, then,
   each man must know his own burden, his own grief and especially his own
   sin--that he may confess it unto God.

   What does all this come to, then, dear Brother, dear Sister? You have,
   perhaps, been coming to see me, or to see one of the elders, about your
   trouble. We cannot help you much, though we will gladly do what we can
   for you. But, now, try to make it clear to your own mind what all the
   trouble is about--get it down in black and white if you can--and then
   come with it to the Lord. Often there is far too much indistinctness in
   our prayers. We really do not know what we are aiming at and,
   consequently, we miss the mark. We have not a clear idea what it is
   that we are seeking of the Lord and, therefore, we do not get it. But
   if we really know our grief and know our burden, and know our sin, and
   know the plague of our own heart--and then go before the Lord with it
   all, and say, "That is my trouble, Lord. I confess it before You with a
   broken heart and a contrite spirit," it will not be long before the
   Lord, in mercy, shall give us peace.

   III. Now, thirdly, and briefly, while it is well to know our grief, IT
   IS BETTER, STILL, TO PRAY ABOUT IT. I have been hammering away at this
   Truth of God, but now I want to give a few blows right upon the head of
   the nail.

   Dear troubled Friend, there is no relief for you like prayer And if you
   are almost in despair, permit me to put the matter to you very gently.
   I will try to push in the thin end of the wedge first. Perhaps, if you
   go to God, and pray about your trouble, you will get deliverance from
   it. I say, perhaps. Put it so, to begin with. You cannot lose anything,
   can you, by praying to God? Suppose you go to the Lord with your
   grief--you cannot be any worse off than you already are, can you? You
   are now in such a sad condition, so much bowed down that if you confess
   your sin and your sorrow at His dear feet, and leave them there, you
   cannot be in a sadder plight than you are now, can you? Well, then,
   say, with the poet--

   "I'll to the gracious King approach, Whose scepterpardon gives. Perhaps
   He may command my touch And then the suppliant lives! Perhaps He will
   admit my plea, Perhaps will hear my prayer-- But if I perish, I will
   pray, And perish only there. I can but perish if I go. I am resolved to
   try, For if I stay away, I know I must forever die."

   It may be that the Lord will deliver you. There is many a man who has
   gone to God on the strength of a, "may be," and yet that, "may be," has
   been enough to land him in Heaven at last! You remember how the whole
   of the people of Nineveh had nothing to rely upon except that question
   of their king, "Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away
   from His fierce anger, that we perish not?" That was a very tiny
   thread, "Who can tell?" But, relying on it, they went and humbled
   themselves before God--and we know what followed--"And God saw their
   works, that they turned from their evil ways. And God repented of the
   evil that He had said that He would do unto them, and He did it not."
   Sister, I would like to whisper that question in your ear, "Who can
   tell?" Brother, I would like to take your hand and say to you, "Come
   now, do not despair. Who can tell? It may be that the Lord will be also
   gracious to you. Go and cast yourself at His feet and determine to lie
   there, and to perish there, if you must perish. But you shall not
   perish if you go to Him."

   Remember, again, that there is One who is quite ready to give you a
   fullhearing, whatever your trouble andyour sin may be, for the Lord
   Jesus Christ already knows all about your trouble--

   "Our fellow Sufferer yet retains

   A fellow feeling of our pains

   And still remembers in the skies

   His tears, and agonies, and cries.

   In every pang that rends the heart,

   The Man of Sorrows had a part.

   He sympathizes in our grief,

   And to the sufferer sends relief." If you come to me, I shall try to
   sympathize with you as fully as I can. But, perhaps, I shall fail, for
   you may be so deep in the bog that I may never have gone quite as low
   down as that. But if you go to the Lord Jesus Christ, you can never be
   as deep in sorrow as He was when His agony forced from Him great drops
   of blood and His soul was "exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death."
   And, as for your sin, black as it is, it is not too black for Him to
   remove! Bring out the sin that is more than a match for Christ, if you
   can. Remember His great declaration, "All manner of sin and blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto men." Oh, it is you, poor woman, is it? Are you
   like the one of whom we were reading just now? Do you feel yourself as
   great a sinner as she was, or are you actually a woman of the very
   vilest class? And are your accusers near, who, if you were to deny your
   guilt, would stand up and witness against you? Jesus says to you, "Go,
   and sin no more." O poor sinful Soul, go to Jesus even if you have all
   the sins that are unmentionable piled upon you! And if you are a man
   who has committed as much sin as all the rest of the world put
   together, yet come along! My Lord, who bore upon His shoulders the sin
   of the world, is fully able to put your sin away--

   "If all the sins that men have done

   In thought, or word, or deed

   Since worlds were made, or time began,

   Were heaped on one poor sinner's head," yet could the blood of Jesus
   Christ blot them all out in a single moment, so that though they were
   sought for, they should never be found again! Oh, that you would but
   come and trust the Lord Jesus Christ!

   "Ah," says one, "that is just my difficulty--I cannot trust Him." If
   you talk like that, you and I will fall out directly! If you tell me
   that you cannot trust my father, I shall say, "My father is a man of
   truth and honor. He pays his debts and he never lies! And I will not
   have you say, 'I cannot trust him.'" But whatever you call my father, I
   shall not be half so indignant as when you tell me that you cannot
   trust my Savior! When did He lie, pray tell? When was He ever false?
   When did He ever fail? You say you cannot trust Him? Why, I feel that
   if I had all your souls in one, I could trust Him with the whole of
   them! Yes, if I could get into this body of mine all the souls that God
   ever made, I would trust Him with the whole bulk, for I am persuaded
   that He was never trusted too much! You could never believe of Christ a
   thing so good that it was not true! Suppose that you believe that He
   can forgive you--He will do it! He will never let your belief go beyond
   what He will do. If you believe that He will wash you so that you shall
   be whiter than snow, He will do it! Faith and Christ often run a race,
   but Christ always wins, for, if faith flies like the wind, Christ
   flashes like the lightning and He outstrips it. You cannot possibly
   believe too good a thing of Him. Just try, now, whether you can do so!
   Should not that Truth of God tend to cheer you, poor downcast one?

   The best thing that you can do is to remember that there is an open
   door to every soul who lives. Then, draw near to God. There is no
   barrier in the way and there is a blessed text, at the end of this
   Book, which says, "Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life
   freely." I saw a man once, in a court ofjustice, who was called up to
   the witness box, but he could not press through the crowd. So the judge
   spoke to the usher, and the usher said to the people, "Let him come!
   Let him come! Let him come!" And after he had said that, there began to
   be a little narrow lane made for him, and so he squeezed his way up.
   Now there is a poor sinner over there, and there are a thousand devils
   between him and Christ! But when Christ says to them, "Let him come!
   Let him come! Let him come!" They must make a lane for him. When our
   Lord Jesus Christ was upon the earth, on the great day of the feast, He
   stood and cried, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me, and drink."
   Who will say to Him, "Lord, I am that man! I am thirsty and You say,
   'Let him come'"? If you say that, who is there to stop you from going
   to Him? Why, if the arch-fiend should set himself right in your way,
   yet if Jesus Christ says, "Let him come," you shall come!

   Did not He say, long ago, "Let there be light"? and the primeval
   darkness, which had lasted throughout many an age, was gone in an
   instant! So, if the Lord says, "Let him come," then all that oppose you
   and try to keep you back must be overthrown, for you shall come! Trust
   Jesus, dear Friend! Trust in the name of the Lord of love and mercy,
   who is looking upon you, a poor, bruised, broken, manacled mass of
   misery. I beseech you, turn your eyes towards Christ. O you poor
   smoking flax, if you have not anything about you but smoke, and that
   smoke is not very sweet, yet Jesus Christ says that He will not quench
   you! O you poor bruised reed, out of which there can come no music as
   you are, I tell you that He will yet get music out of you! Only look to
   Him, poor troubled one, for He knows how to bind up the broken in
   heart, and to heal their wounds and, thereby, to glorify Himself. Oh,
   for another prayer, even though it were your last! Do breathe it. I
   know that Satan will try hard to stop you. He will say, "It is no use!
   You have been praying for months! You have been praying for years!"
   Yes, but, this time pray as you never prayed before! Perhaps you have
   been lifting up your eyes to a priest, or to a man, or to a Doctrine,
   or to a creed--now just look right away to Jesus Christ! That is the
   way that prayer was heard in the olden days, when they looked toward
   the Temple! And your prayer shall be heard when you look to the Savior!
   "Oh, but just look at me!" you say. No, I do not want to look at you! I
   want you to look to Christ. "Oh, but, Sir, I am dreadfully wicked! I
   confess it with shame." Yes, and you are probably a hundred times worse
   than you think you are! You are a good-for-nothing sort of person. You
   are an out-of-the-way sinner, but that is the very reason why I want
   you to believe in Him "who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on
   them that are out of the way."

   I want you to look to Him who came to earth on purpose that He might
   wash these Blackamoors white, and take the spots out of these leopards,
   and make them to become like lambs! My Lord did not come into the world
   to be a doctor who only cures finger-aches and small complaints! He
   came to cleanse the lepers, to cast out demons, to raise the dead--
   even Lazarus, who had begun to putrefy! Oh, He is such a glorious
   Savior that I cannot speak His praises loudly enough, though speaking
   of Him warms my own heart! My voice was hoarse when I began my sermon
   and I thought I could hardly get through the discourse, but, with such
   a theme as this, I forget all weakness and pain! Yes, raise me even
   when I am dying, that I may sit up in bed and begin to praise Him!
   There never was a sinner half as big as Christ is a Savior! Come and
   measure the sinner, if you like, from head to foot, and all round. Make
   him out to be an elephantine sinner, yet there is room for him in the
   Ark, Christ Jesus! There is room in the heart of Jesus for the vilest
   of the vile! Oh, that you would turn your eyes to Him and pray to Him
   from your very heart and trust in Him with your whole soul!

   I finish up by saying that those who do this shall find rest unto their
   souls. Solomon's petition was that they should be forgiven. "Then hear
   You from Heaven, Your dwelling place, and forgive." Yes, and everything
   else that a sinner needs is ready for him when he comes to Christ. I do
   not know--I cannot tell--all that you need, but I do know that all you
   ever can need between here and Heaven is laid up for you in Christ
   Jesus! I have used this illustration before. Here is a poor little babe
   that we have picked up in the streets. What shall we do with it? What
   does this child need? Well, it needs washing--look how filthy it is,
   for it has been lying in the gutter. It needs food, poor little
   creature--look how emaciated it is. It needs proper clothes--look at
   its rags. I would have to keep on a long time and you mothers who are
   listening to me might say, "He does not know much about what the babe
   needs." But I will show you that I do, because in one single sentence I
   will tell you what that child needs! It needs its MOTHER! And when it
   gets its mother, it has got everything. When its mother finds it, then
   it is provided for! And what you need, dear Soul, is pardon, cleansing,
   clothing, training, sanctifying--but I will not go over it all. What
   you need is your SAVIOR! You need Jesus and if you get Jesus, you never
   shall have a need that is outside of Christ! You shall never have a
   necessity that is not comprised within the matchless circle of His
   unspeakable all-sufficiency! Oh, take Christ to your heart and your
   fortune is made! You have all you need for time and for eternity, when
   once the Lord Jesus Christ is yours! Oh, that you would make a dash for
   this great blessing!

   "I am afraid to come," says one. Well come all trembling and
   fearing--only come. "But I am afraid I shall be cast out if I come."
   Oh, but you must not indulge that fear, for He has said, "He that comes
   to Me I will in no wise cast out." "But suppose I should not happen to
   be one of the right sort?" Come all the same, whether you are or not,
   for Christ will not cast you out if you do but come to Him! When a man
   is very hungry, if he takes bread that is not his own and eats it, no
   one will ever take it away from him, for he has it too securely. So, if
   you come and take the Lord Jesus Christ into your very soul, there is
   no one who can take Him away from you! "Oh, taste and see that the Lord
   is good!" And he that really feeds upon Him has so received Him that he
   shall never lose Him. Oh, that all who are strangers to Him might do so
   even now. The Lord bless you all, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 7:53; 8:1-11.

   John 7:53; John 8:1: And every man went unto his own house. Jesus went
   unto the Mount of Olives. That is, as every man went to his own house
   to rest, so Jesus found rest in secret prayer on the Mount of Olives.
   There is a very striking contrast here. It is a pity to have brought
   the dividing saw right through the middle of such charming consecutive
   sentences.

   2. And early in the morning He came again into the Temple, and all the
   people came unto Him; and He sat down, and taught them. That is always
   the posture in the East--the teachers sit, and the hearers stand. We
   may have to try that plan one of these days--it might be better for me
   and, also, for you! There might be less drowsiness, perhaps, if the
   congregation had to stand to listen to the preacher's message.

   3, 4. And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto Him a woman taken in
   adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, they said unto Him,
   Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act They did this
   only to entangle the Savior--not because they wanted to learn anything
   of Him, or to do this woman any good, or even to vindicate morality. It
   was simply an effort to entrap Him.

   5, 6. Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such should be stoned: but
   what say You? This they said, tempting Him, that they might have to
   accuse Him. They could accuse Him either way. If He sanctioned their
   stoning the woman, they would charge Him with violating the Roman law.
   But if He said that she should not be stoned, then they would say that
   He differed from Moses and set aside the Law of God.

   6, 7. But Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground,
   as though He heard them not So when they continued asking Him, He
   lifted up Himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among
   you, let him first cast a stone at her That sentence must have flashed
   like a drawn sword, keen as a razor, through the very midst of them!
   Here were men who had probably been living in abominable sin, yet they
   had brought this poor sinful woman to Jesus and laid this accusation
   against her.

   8. And again He stooped down, and wrote on the ground. After He had
   fired that one red-hot shot, He waited until it had produced its due
   effect.

   9. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
   went out, one by one, beginning with the eldest, even unto the last;
   and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst They left
   her alone with Jesus in the midst of the place that the guilty crowd
   had forsaken in silent shame.

   10. 11. When Jesus had lifted up Himself, and saw none but the woman,
   He said unto her, Woman, where are those, your accusers? Has no man
   condemned you? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither
   do I condemn you: go, and sin no more. He condemned the sin--His own
   pure and holy life was the best condemnation of that. But, as for the
   sinner, He had not come to condemn, but to forgive. His own declaration
   was, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."

The Right Observance of the Lord's Supper

   (No. 2638)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   4, 1882.

   "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you.
   That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took
   bread: and when Hie had given thanks, He broke it and said, Take, eat:
   this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me.
   After the same manner, also, He took the cup, when He had supped,
   saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood: this do you as often
   as you drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat this
   bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till He comes."
   1 Corinthians 11:23-26.

   WE have no respect whatever for the ordinances of men in religion.
   Anything that is only invented by churches, or councils, is nothing
   whatever to us. We know of two ordinances instituted by the Lord Jesus
   Christ--the Baptism of Believers and the Lord's Supper. And we utterly
   abhor and reject all pretended "sacraments" of every kind. And because
   we observe these two ordinances, and these two, only, we are the more
   concerned that they should be properly used and duly understood, and
   that they should minister to the edification of those who participate
   in them. We would have those who are baptized understand what is meant
   by that expressive rite--that they, being dead with Christ, should also
   be buried with Him and rise with Him into newness of life. And when we
   observe the Lord's Supper, we feel a deep and earnest desire that none
   should come to the Table in ignorance of the significance of the
   observance--or that, at least, ignorance may not be an occasion of
   eating unworthily--but that we may comprehend what we are doing and
   understand the spiritual meaning of this pictorial instruction by which
   the Lord Jesus Christ would, even until the end of the age, remind His
   Church of His great Sacrifice upon the Cross.

   I. So, first, I will speak briefly concerning THE FORM OF THE LORD'S
   SUPPER.

   We do not think that it is at all material where that supper is held.
   It is just as valid and helpful in your own private apartments, in your
   bedroom, or in your parlor, as it is in any place where Christians
   usually congregate. We do not attach so much importance as some people
   do to the time when it is observed, but we are astonished that High
   Churchmen should be opposed to evening communion, for, if any definite
   time for partaking of it can be quoted from Scripture, it certainly is
   the evening! I should like to ask the Ritualists whether they can find
   any instance, either in holy or profane things, of a supper being eaten
   before breakfast--until they invented that absurd practice! There is no
   time that is more like the first occasion when the Master celebrated
   the ordinance with His disciples than is the evening of the day. Then
   it was that He gathered the 12 Apostles together and instituted this
   blessed memorial feast! At Emmaus, too, it was at the close of the day
   that He was made known to His two disciples in the breaking of bread.
   It must be sheer superstition, utterly unwarranted by Holy Scripture,
   which tells us that the Lord's Supper can only be properly received in
   the morning and that we ought not to eat anything before we partake of
   the sacred emblems! We reject all such nonsense, for we find no
   authority for it in the only standard which we recognize, that is, the
   Inspired Word of God! Let us see what it teaches us concerning this
   ordinance.

   We learn, first, that the Lord's Supper should begin with thanksgiving.
   So the Master Himself evidently commenced it--"He took bread and gave
   thanks." All through the Supper, the emotion of gratitude should be in
   active exercise. It is intended that we should give thanks for the
   bread--at the same time giving still more emphatic thanks for the
   sacred body which it represents. Then we should also give thanks for
   the cup and for that most precious blood which is therein represented
   to us. We cannot rightly observe the Lord's Supper unless we come to
   the table, blessing, praising, magnifying and adoring our
   Savior--praising Him even for instituting such a festival of
   remembrance--such a memorial ordinance to help our frail memories! And
   praising Him yet more for giving us so blessed a thing to remember as
   His own great Sacrifice for our sin.

   After the thanksgiving, it is very clear that our Divine Lord broke the
   bread. We scarcely know what kind of bread was used on that occasion.
   It was probably the thin passover cake of the Jews, but there is
   nothing said in Scripture about the use of leavened or unleavened bread
   and, therefore, it matters not which we use! Where there is no
   ordinance, there is no obligation and we are, therefore, left free to
   use the bread which it is our custom to eat. When the Master had broken
   the bread, He gave it to His disciples, and said, "Take, eat." And they
   all participated in eating it. And this, mark you, is essential to the
   right observance of the Lord's Supper, so that, when the priest, in
   celebrating "mass," takes the wafer, which is not bread and which he
   does not break, but which he, himself, eats whole, there is no Lord's
   Supper there! Whatever it may be called, it is not the Lord's Supper.
   In the eating of the bread, there must be the participation of such a
   number of faithful, godly disciples of Christ as may be present, or
   else it is not the ordinance which the Lord instituted.

   That being done, the next thing was that, "After the same manner also
   He took the cup." That is to say, after the same manner of
   thanksgiving, blessing God for the fruit of the vine, which was
   henceforth to be the emblem of His poured-out blood. Even so should we.
   It is no vain thing to praise the Lord, though we do it twice,
   thrice--yes, and ten thousand times! Well did the Psalmist say, "Praise
   you the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is
   pleasant; and praise is comely." Especially comely is it for us to
   praise our God when we are calling to remembrance the unspeakable gift
   of His only-begotten and well-beloved Son!

   Then came the partaking of the cup--the fruit of the vine--of which the
   Master expressly said, "Drink you all of it." Hence, when the Church of
   Rome takes away the cup from the people and denies it to them, there is
   no observance of the Lord's Supper, for another essential part of the
   ordinance is left out. It may be the "mass," or it may be anything
   else, but it is not the Supper of the Lord! There must be a
   participation by all the faithful in the cup, as well as in the bread,
   otherwise the Lord's death is not shown, or proclaimed according to
   Christ's most holy and blessed command.

   Further, in order that this may be the Lord's Supper in very truth, it
   must be observed in remembrance of Christ, who said to His disciples,
   "This do in remembrance of Me." From which we learn that only those who
   know Him must come to His Table, for how shall we remember what we
   never knew? And how shall we remember Him with whom we have never
   spoken and in whom we have never believed? You are not to come to the
   Lord's Supper to get faith--you must have faith, first--or else you
   have no right to draw near to this sacred spot. What do you do here? If
   you suppose that this is a saving ordinance, I must say to you what
   Christ said to the Sadducees, "You do err, not knowing the Scriptures."
   Salvation comes to us through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and it is
   the result of the effectual working of the Spirit of God within us This
   Supper is a most instructive ordinance for those who are saved, but
   those who are not born again and are not, by Divine Grace, members of
   the Lord's family, have no right here. They who ate the Passover were
   such as were born in the priest's house, or bought with the priest's
   money--and if you have been born in Christ's house, or bought with
   Christ's blood--if you know, by blessed experience, the meaning of
   regeneration and redemption, then you may come to the Communion Table.
   But, if not, as the Passover was only intended for Israel, so is this
   supper a family feast for those who belong to Jesus Christ--no others
   may come to it! If they do come, it will be at the peril of eating and
   drinking unworthily since they are unable to discern the Lord's body.

   I have thus given you a very brief account of the form of observing the
   Lord's Supper, as we find it in the New Testament. You notice that I
   have not said anything about a chalice, or a paten, or about
   consecrating the elements, or uplifting the host and all that Romish
   rubbish of which some people think so much. The reason for my silence
   is that there is nothing about these things in the Bible. "To the Law,
   and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this Word, it is
   because there is no light in them." Clear away all the additions of
   superstition--they are but the dust and the rust which have accumulated
   during the ages and they spoil and mar the purity of Christ's own
   ordinance! Our great concern must be to observe it exactly as He has
   delivered it to us, in accordance with His own injunction, "This do in
   remembrance of Me"--not something else in its place.

   II. Now, secondly, from our text I gather THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LORD'S
   SUPPER.

   First, because it was revealed by the Lord Himself. Paul wrote to the
   Corinthians, "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
   unto you." Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were all accessible to Paul
   and, though they had not then written their Gospels, yet he could have
   learned from them how the Savior instituted the Supper. But, as if
   Christ would not let it be secondhand, He was pleased to declare to
   Paul, personally--to Paul, himself--directly and distinctly, how the
   Supper should be celebrated. The Apostle says, "I have received of the
   Lord"--not, " we"--not, "I and the rest of the Apostles and disciples,"
   but--"I have received of the Lord," indicating a definite personal
   Revelation from Christ as to this matter. After the Lord Jesus had gone
   up into Glory, His Revelations were but few, yet this was one of them.
   He would have His disciples, therefore, pay due attention to this
   important matter which He thus especially revealed to Paul. O Beloved,
   I often tremble for those who tamper with the ordinances of
   Christ--they alter them, or shift them out of their proper places--and
   then say that their alterations are unimportant! Mary said to the
   servants at Cana of Galilee, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." And we
   have need of the same command today! We must not alter anything that
   Christ has ordained, for, "where the word of a king is, there is power"
   and, in the Word of the King of Kings, there is power to condemn those
   who alter His Word. Whatever Christ has commanded is to be obeyed by
   us-- and as He took special pains concerning this ordinance, to make a
   distinct Revelation over and above the guidance of the Holy Spirit to
   the four Evangelists, we may be certain that He intended to surround
   this Supper with the utmost solemnity and authority.

   I have already referred to the next point, but it is so important that
   I remind you, again, that this Supper was commanded by the Lord. He
   said, "This do in remembrance of Me." And again, "This do you, as often
   as you drink it, in remembrance of Me." If I love Christ, I am bound to
   keep His commandments--and among the rest of His commandments, this one
   in which He, here, says, "This do." I might have thought, from the
   conduct of some professing Christians, that Jesus must have said, "This
   do not" but as He said, "This do you," where shall I find an apology
   for those who either never have done it at all, or, being His people,
   do it so seldom that He could not say to them, "This do you, as often
   as you drink it," but He might rather say, "This do you as seldom as
   you drink it," since the idea of frequency does not enter into their
   observance of it? But, dear Friends, what Christ revealed and
   commanded, it is incumbent upon His own beloved ones to obey!

   Notice, again, that this supper was instituted by Christ, Himself,
   andHe, Himself, first set the example for its observance. As to
   Baptism, you remember how He said, "Thus it becomes us to fulfill all
   righteousness," and so He set us the example in that matter. And, in
   the Supper, it was He who first blessed and broke the bread. It was He
   who first passed the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant in My
   blood." If He had given the command and the Apostles had been the first
   to attend to it, it would have been binding upon us, but, inasmuch as,
   in addition to giving the command concerning it, He, Himself, set the
   example of observing it--sitting at the center of the table, with the
   12 all around Him--I think He has put a special halo about this
   ordinance and we must, by no means forget, or neglect, or despise it.

   Remember, too, that He established it on a very special occasion. To my
   mind, it is very touching to read, "The Lord Jesus, the same night in
   which He was betrayed, took bread." I cannot help noticing that the
   Apostle is very particular to say here, "The Lord Jesus." Very often He
   uses the name, "Christ," in speaking of the Savior. But here it is,
   "the Lord Jesus," to show the awe and reverence which the Apostle felt
   as, by faith, he saw the Master at the first Communion Table. Paul
   could not forget that, though Jesus was then Lord of All, He was that
   same night betrayed. He that ate bread with Him lifted up his heel
   against Him and sold Him for 30 pieces of silver! Yet, even while the
   anticipation of that betrayal and all which it involved was tearing His
   heart asunder, He remembered us and established this ordinance that, by
   refreshing our memories concerning His blessed Self, we might not be
   left to play the traitor, too, but might be kept steadfast in every
   time of trial. O Brothers and Sisters, it seems to me that we must be
   especially careful to observe such an ordinance as this, instituted
   when our Savior's heart was breaking with anguish on our behalf!

   And remember, too, the importance of the ordinance, because of the
   peculiar personal motive with which it was instituted--"This do in
   remembrance"--of what? Of Christianity and its doctrines and practices?
   No. But, "in remembrance of Me." You know how tenderly a thing comes
   home to you if a dying husband says, "This do, my beloved one, in
   remembrance of me, when I am dead and gone." You never fail to do that,
   I am sure, if it is in your power. You know how it is with a friend who
   has gone from you and who has left you some forget-me-not. You treasure
   it with the utmost care. The memento is very precious for your friend's
   sake and our dear Lord and Master has put about this Supper all the
   loveliness of His personality, all the graciousness of His affection
   for us and all the tenderness that ought to be in our love to Him. If
   there is anything that He bids you do, you ought to do it--but when it
   is something to be done in remembrance of Him, you must do it--your
   love impels you to do it! Are you not ashamed if you are not doing it
   in the most loving, humble, grateful and earnest manner possible, as
   becomes the memory of Him who loved you and gave Himself for you? I
   would not like to have to urge any Christian to come to the Communion
   Table--I feel as if I would do nothing to spoil the perfect spontaneity
   of it. If you do not love Him, do not come to His Table! But if you
   love Him, come because you love Him. Come because you remember Him and
   because you wish to be helped to remember Him yet more. If there is
   nothing about Him that you wish to remember, do not dare come! But, if
   He is precious to your soul, your transport and your trust. If His very
   name is music to your ears, honey to your mouth and joy to your heart,
   then you do not need me to press you to come to His Table, but you will
   come because He says, "This do you in remembrance of Me."

   There is one more thing which adds to the importance of this Supper and
   that is, it is to be observed "till He comes." It is not an ordinance,
   then, for the first Christian centuries, alone, to be, as it were, the
   bridge between the ceremonialism of the Old Testament and the
   spirituality of the New Testament. No, it is intended to be celebrated
   "till He comes." We must keep on gathering at His Table, giving thanks,
   breaking bread and proclaiming His death till the trumpet of the
   archangel shall startle us--and then we shall feel it to be truly
   blessed to be found obediently remembering Him when He puts in His
   appearance at the last! As He comes to us, we shall say, "Blessed
   Master, we have done as You did bid us. We have kept alive Your memory
   in the world to ourselves and to those who looked on as we broke the
   bread and drank of the cup in Your name. And now we rejoice to see You
   in Your Glory." I do not know that the meeting between Christ and His
   people could happen at a better time than if He were to come when they
   were gathered at His Table, obeying His command and showing His death
   "till He comes."

   Thus I have tried, as briefly as I could, to give instruction as to the
   importance of this Supper. I hope that the Holy Spirit will press home
   the Truth of God upon the hearts of any who have not observed this
   ordinance, before, and that He will lead them to ask if they are,
   indeed, Believers in Jesus, and lovers of the Lord, how they can
   justify themselves for their disobedience to what Christ has so
   expressly commanded!

   III. But now, thirdly, let us enquire, IN WHAT SPIRIT OUGHT WE TO COME
   TO THIS TABLE?

   I should say, first, that we are bound to come in the spirit of deep
   humility Brothers and Sisters, to my mind, it is a very humbling thing
   that we should need anything to help us to remember Christ. I see no
   better evidence of the fact that we are not yet perfectly sanctified,
   for, if we were, we would need nothing to help us to remember Him.
   There is, alas, still an imperfection in our memory--and that strangest
   and saddest thing of all--in respect to Jesus Himself. It is
   extraordinary that we should ever require anything to help us to
   remember Him. Can He, to whom we owe so much, be ever forgotten by us?
   The fact that this ordinance is to be observed in remembrance of Him,
   "till He comes," is a humbling proof that till that glorious event, His
   people's memories will be faulty and they will need this double
   forget-me-not to remind them of Him who is their All-in-All.

   What do I see on that Table? I see bread there. Then I gather this
   humbling lesson--that I cannot even keep myself in spiritual food. I am
   such a pauper, such an utter beggar, that my own table cannot furnish
   me with what I need and I must come to the Lord's Table--and I must
   receive, through Him, the spiritual nutriment which my soul requires.
   What do I see in the cup? I see the wine which is the token of His shed
   blood. What does that say to me but that I still need cleansing? Oh,
   how I rejoice in that blessed text in John's first Epistle--"If we walk
   in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one
   another." And then what follows? That we do not need to make any more
   confession of sin because we are quite cleansed from it? Nothing of the
   sort! "And the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin." We still need the cleansing fountain even when we are walking in
   the light, as God is in the light--and we need to come to it every day!
   And what a mercy it is that the emblem sets forth the constant
   provision of purifying blood whereby we may be continually cleansed! As
   we partake of this cup, we must do so humbly, for thus it becomes us to
   come to the Table of our Lord.

   But, next, we must come very thankfully. Some pull a long face when
   they think about coming to the Communion Table, like Mrs. Too-Good who
   is described in Rowland Hill's Village Dialogues. She made a mistake
   about the week that the ordinance was to be observed, so she did not
   play cards during that week and kept herself wonderfully pure, poor old
   soul. And then, when she found, on Sunday, that she had made a blunder
   as to the time, she said she had wasted the whole week in getting
   ready! Ah, dear Friends, I hope we do not know anything of thatmethod
   of keeping the sacred feast. We are to come in a very different frame
   of mind than that, for we are not coming to a funeral supper, but to
   the luxuries and dainties that become a marriage feast! Let us come,
   therefore, with thankfulness, as we say to one another concerning our
   Lord, "He is not here, for He is risen, glory be to His holy name!"
   These tokens of remembrance tell us that He has gone where it was
   expedient for Him to go, that the Holy Spirit might descend upon us.
   Therefore, Beloved, rejoice even because of the absence of your Lord,
   for it is well that He should be gone up into Glory. And, as we come to
   the Table, each one feeling what a sinner he is--how unworthy he is to
   come--how unfit he is to sit with saints--should not each heart say,
   "Bless the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy
   name"? Twice during the feast, special thanksgivings are to be
   presented--but all through the feast let the heart be full of holy
   gratitude and praise to

   God!

   But, we should certainly come to the Table with great thoughtfulness.
   There are some, we are told, who do not discern the Lord's body--let us
   think and pray, lest we should be numbered with them. If there is no
   right thinking, there will be no true spiritual feeling and there will
   be no Lord's Supper so far as you are concerned. Think of what your
   Savior suffered for you, what He has done for you and what He has gone
   to prepare for you! Let us remember that the bread sets forth the
   suffering of His body, that the wine typifies the blood of the
   Atonement whereby we are cleansed--that the two, apart--the body
   separated from the blood, form a most suggestive symbol of the
   matchless death whereby we are made to live! Think much at the Table,
   but think of nothing but Christ! Fix your thoughts entirely upon Him
   and so shall you eat of this bread and drink of this cup to your soul's
   refreshment and profit!

   But come, also, with great receptiveness. It is a meal, you know. We
   receive the bread and the wine. So, come to the Table begging the Lord
   to give you the Grace to feed upon Himself spiritually, that you may,
   by faith, receive Him into your inward parts--that in your inmost soul
   you may have the virtue of His life and of His death! Come empty,
   therefore, for so you will be the better qualified to feed upon Him.
   Come hungering and thirsting--thus you will have the greater appetite
   for Christ. Receive Him in all His fullness by a wonderful faith that
   takes Him in to be a joy to the heart forever.

   That is the spirit, then, in which to come to the Lord's Table. May the
   blessed Spirit be with you, dear Brothers and Sisters, that all who do
   come to the Table may come in that humble, thankful, thoughtful,
   receptive style!

   IV. Now I finish my discourse by dwelling, for a minute or two, upon
   THE GREAT LESSONS WHICH THIS SUPPER INCIDENTALLY TEACHES.

   The first lesson is, that Jesus is for us. There has been a great
   dispute over this verse, "This is My body, which is broken for you."
   The word, "broken," appears in some of the ancient manuscripts, but it
   is, undoubtedly, an interpolation. It is absent from several of those
   manuscripts upon which we are obliged to rely for the correct text of
   the New Testament and, therefore, very properly, the Revised Version
   reads, "This is My body, which is for you." And, to my mind, that
   rendering gives a new thought which is well worth having. "This is My
   body, which is for you." That is to say, Christ is for you--does not
   the Supper, itself, say that? The bread represents His body for
   you--the wine represents His blood for you. We know that it is for you
   because you are going to eat it. There is nothing that is more
   certainly a man's than what he eats or drinks. Our proverb says,
   "Possession is nine points of the law." And I wonder how many points of
   the law it is when a man has eaten a thing up? There is no legal
   quibble that can deprive him of that. Whatever suit at law may be
   brought, there is no possibility of taking away from a man that which
   he has eaten and, in like manner, when we have really received Christ
   by faith, there is no possibility of robbing us of Him. "This is My
   body, which is for you." Oh, what a blessed Doctrine! Lay hold of this
   great Truth of God, all that there is in Christ is for you! All the
   fullness of the Godhead is in Him, "and of His fullness have all we
   received, and grace for grace." Glory be to His name for this!

   The next lesson is that His blood has sealed the Covenant. "This cup is
   the new covenant in my blood." I wish I had an hour or two in which I
   might speak to you about the Covenant. It is no use to begin on that
   great subject in the few minutes we have left. There was a Covenant
   that cursed us--the Covenant of Works. There is another Covenant that
   has blessed the elect of God and shall bless them to all eternity--the
   Covenant of Grace--and this Covenant is signed, sealed and ratified, in
   all things ordered well--and for its seal it has the blood of God's own
   Son! Therefore it shall stand fast forever and ever. So, as you partake
   of that cup, drink with joy because it reminds you that God has made
   with you "an everlasting Covenant ordered in all things and sure." Oh,
   I am certain that if you know the music of that word, "Covenant," you
   will enjoy coming to the Table, even if nothing but that one word shall
   be brought to your memory!

   The third great Doctrine that is taught by this Supper is that
   Believers feed on Christ Himself. Sometimes they forget this and they
   try to feed on doctrines. They will make as great a mistake as if the
   Jew, when he went up to the tabernacle, had tried to feed on the
   curtains, or the altar, or the golden tongs! What did he have for food?
   Why, the peace-offering! When he drew near to his God, he fed on the
   sacrifice--and the true food of a Believer is Christ Jesus, Himself!
   Feed on Him, then, Beloved. We cannot literally eat His body or drink
   His blood--we would be worse than cannibals to attempt such a thing!
   But we can do it, and we must do it spiritually, by having our hearts
   and our minds resting upon what Christ is and what He has done, and so
   feeding upon our Lord Jesus Christ.

   I have finished when I have mentioned one more lesson which is to be
   learned from this ordinance. It is clear, from this Supper, that the
   way to remember Christ is to feed on Him again and again. Is it not a
   strange thing that if I have had a great mercy, the way to remember
   that mercy is to come to God and get another mercy? If Christ was ever
   sweet to my taste, the way to perpetuate that sweetness is to come and
   taste Him again! Dear Brothers and Sisters, do not try to live upon
   your old experiences! Even the best kind of bread will not stay fresh
   very long--it soon gets musty if you lay it by. You need to have bread
   constantly coming fresh from the oven. Even the manna, which came down
   from Heaven, could not be kept, lest it should breed worms--and so it
   is with the food for your souls. Do not try to live on moldy
   experiences.

   More than 30 years ago I had great joy in the Lord when first I knew
   Him. I am very glad that I can remember it, but that recollection is of
   little use to me when I get depressed in spirit. No, then I need the
   Lord to come to me again as He came then. You came to Jesus Christ, did
   you not, as a poor, empty sinner, ever so many years ago? Then, come
   again in the same way! Come to Christ every day as you came to Him the
   first day! "Oh, but I was only a sinner then!" Well, you are not much
   more than that now! And you will find it the safest thing to come just
   as you came at first. "Well, but am I not an experienced saint by this
   time?" Yes, yes, I daresay you are, but I find that whenever I have on
   the one robe of my experience, I am like the lady at court with a long
   train--somebody is sure to step on it--and then it gets torn. I like to
   come to Jesus Christ just as I came at first.

   Suppose that the devil says to me, "You are no child of God." I have
   often said to him, "You do not know much about that matter, though you
   know that you are not one, yourself." "But," he says, "you do not know
   the Lord." "Ah, then," I ask him, "what am I?" He answers, "You are a
   great black sinner!" Then, like Luther, I cut off his head with his own
   sword, just as David did with Goliath, for I say to him, "Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save sinners and I am going off to the sinners'
   Savior, just to trust in Him as I did at the first!" And the devil
   generally departs when I tell him that. There is nothing that is so
   soul-strengthening as taking another look at the bronze serpent, or
   having another plunge in the fountain filled with blood, or feeding,
   once again, on the inexhaustible provision that is stored up for us in
   the Person of our Lord!

   If any of you who have come to the Table of the Lord are not believers
   in Christ, never dare to come again while you are in that state! You
   have no right here unless you are resting in Jesus and trusting in Him!
   This is the proof of your being new creatures in Christ Jesus. But if
   you have the faintest, feeblest faith in Jesus, come and welcome! If
   you are trusting in your own merits, go to your own table--if you think
   there will be some meritin your coming to the Communion Table, do not
   dare to come, for that were to turn the ordinance upside down! You are
   not to bring something, but to receive something. May you who love the
   Lord find Him to be very precious to you and may those of you who do
   not know Him, seek Him at once, not at the Table, but at the Mercy Seat
   and at the Cross! Trust in Jesus, for so you shall be saved, and then
   you shall have the right of entry to the Lord's House--and you shall
   have the privilege of sitting at His Table and of enjoying every other
   blessing which is the portion of the chosen family. The Lord make it to
   be so, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 CORINTHIANS 11:17-34; LUKE22:14-24.

   The members of the Church at Corinth abounded in gifts and, therefore,
   they thought it right for each one to speak to edification. They had no
   pastoral oversight whatever--acting, in this respect, like certain
   brethren whom we know nowadays. The result, however, was very
   deplorable. They do not appear to have been able to even conduct the
   Lord's Supper without the most disorderly proceedings. Church
   discipline was utterly forgotten or neglected and it seems as if the
   two Epistles to the Corinthians are given to us as beacons to warn us
   against that form of worship, seeing that it produces such mischievous
   and sad results!

   1 Corinthians 11:17. Nowin this that Ideclare unto you Ipraise you not,
   thatyou come together not for the better, but for the worse. I t is a
   very bad state of things when we meet for worship and separate without
   any improvement, or, like these Corinthians, "come together, not for
   the better, but for the worse."

   18. For first of all, when you come together in the Church, I hear that
   there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it I t was very
   gracious and kind on the Apostle's part to put it so mildly--and he
   sets us the example of not believing anything against our brethren too
   quickly. "I partly believe it."

   19-21. For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
   approved may be made manifest among you. When you come together,
   therefore, into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper For in
   eating everyone takes before others his own supper: and one is hungry,
   and another is drunk They seem to have regarded it as a common feast to
   which they brought their own provisions and, without waiting for each
   other, they disgraced the Table of the Lord by their scandalous
   proceedings.

   22. What? Have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise you
   the Church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to
   you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not No doubt they hoped
   to be praised and expected that they had done everything in the right
   way! Perhaps they even believed that they were acting under the
   Inspiration of the Spirit and, therefore, could not do anything wrong.
   But the Apostle deals very faithfully with them and tells them how the
   Supper is to be celebrated. How much we have gained by the mistakes of
   others! As the Inspired Apostle is guided to inform us as to the right
   mode of observing this ordinance, we may almost be thankful that the
   Corinthians fell into error concerning it--as much as we may regret
   their faults on their own account.

   23, 24. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
   unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed
   took bread: and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, Take,
   eat: this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance
   of Me. These are the words of the Lord Jesus, Himself, and therefore
   they come to us with all the weight of His Infallible authority! Then
   Paul continues--

   25, 26. After the same manner, also, He took the cup, when He had
   supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood: this do you,
   as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat
   this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till He
   comes. "Show" or, "proclaim." The latter is the better word. "You do
   proclaim the Lord's death till He comes." That last phrase ought
   finally to settle the question of the perpetuity of the Lord's Supper,
   which is to be observed "till He comes."

   27. Therefore whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
   Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. '
   'Unworthily," that is, in a thoughtless, careless way--or with a view
   to worldly gain, as some used to take it in order to obtain an office
   under government and as some, doubtless, do take it, to obtain the alms
   of the church. Such an unworthy participation is a sin against the very
   body and blood of the Lord!

   28. But let a man examine himself, andso let him eat ofthat bread, and
   drink ofthat cup. Paul does not say, "Let a man examine himself and
   then noteat or drink at the communion." The examination should lead him
   to repentance, to faith and should then bring him to the Table of
   fellowship in the right state of mind and heart. The examination is not
   a door to shut him out from the ordinance, but a door at which he may
   pause awhile, to see whether he is in a right condition to enter. And
   if he is not, he should seek to be made so, and then enter.

   29. For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation
   to himself not discerning the Lord's body. "Eats and drinks judgment to
   himself," for "judgment" is the word here used by the Apostle.

   30. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
   It appears that God visited this Church at Corinth with sickness, and
   took away many of the members by death because they had profaned the
   Lord's Table and had walked in a disorderly manner before Him. Paul did
   not mean to say that these persons were lost--he intended to remind
   their fellow members and all who might read his Epistle, that God
   visits Churches after this fashion with discipline and chastening
   because of the unseemly conduct which is always so offensive to Him.

   31, 32. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But
   when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be
   condemned with the world. So, you see, that chastening process, which
   is going on in the Church, is all in love--"that we should not be
   condemned with the world"--just as a father exercises discipline in his
   household and uses chastisement that his children may never disobey the
   laws of the realm. They will never come before the police court, for
   they are kept under proper control at home and are tutored and trained
   by their father's wise government. So we come not under the judgment of
   the Law of God, as the world, itself, comes--we come under the
   disciplinary treatment of the great Head of the Church, even the Lord
   Jesus Christ!

   33, 34. Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry
   one for another Andif any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that you
   come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order
   when I come. Now let us read Luke's account of the institution of this
   Supper. As we do so, it will be well for us to remember that Luke was a
   friend and intimate companion of Paul.

   Luke 22:14-16 And when the hour was come, He sat down, and the twelve
   Apostles with Him. And He said unto them, With desire I have desired to
   eat this Passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I will
   not any more eat thereof, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
   This was to be the last occasion on which our Lord and His disciples
   would thus meet.

   17, 18. And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
   divide it among yourselves: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the
   fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come. That was the
   Passover cup. Now the Passover melts into the Lord's Supper and,
   henceforth, the Lord's Supper remains and the Passover has passed away.

   19-21. And He took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave unto
   them, saying, This is My body which is given for you: this do in
   remembrance of Me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup
   is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you. But, behold,
   the hand of him that betrays Me is with Me on the table. What a
   sobering, saddening effect this must have had upon those who were at
   that festival! We have reason to fear that it will be true of our
   gathering, also. There were only 12 Apostles, yet there was a Judas
   among them. We shall have many hundreds at our observance of the
   ordinance--may we not fear that there will be many a Judas, too? Can we
   expect that we shall have a better selection of professed followers of
   Christ than the Lord had made for His Apostles?

   22-24. And truly the Son of Man goes, as it was determined: but woe
   unto that man by whom He is betrayed! And they began to enquire among
   themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. And there
   was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the
   greatest That had been their question among themselves, but now they
   have another enquiry, of quite a different sort, to answer. It was wise
   of the Master to give them a heart-searching question to drive out that
   question of ambition which had filled them with pride and contention.
   Oh, if any of us ever had such a thought as that in our bosom--which of
   us is greatest?--who can speak the best?--who can serve God the
   most?--who can take the lead?--let all such questions be set aside
   while we sorrowfully entertain the other sad enquiry--which of us will
   betray our Lord? God grant that none of us may ever do so!

Our Heavenly Father's Pity

   (No. 2639)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY SEPTEMBER 10, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING IN 1857.

   "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that
   fear Him." Psalm 103:13.

   WHAT a blow this is for our pride! Then God's children are pitiable
   objects, notwithstanding that He has crowned them with glory and honor,
   has given them perfection in Christ Jesus, has breathed into them the
   breath of spiritual life, has set their feet upon a rock and
   established their goings--yet they are and they always will be, so long
   as they are here below--pitiable objects! It is like tolling the
   death-knell of all our pride to talk about God pitying us! Why, my
   Brothers and Sisters, we shed our pity profusely upon the ungodly--we
   are often pitying the wicked, the profane, the blasphemer and
   Sabbath-breaker--but here we find God pitying us! Even David, the
   mighty Psalmist, is pitied! A Prophet, a priest, a king--each of these
   shall have pity from God, for, "He pities them that fear Him," and
   finds good reasons for pitying them, however high their station,
   however holy their character, or however happy their position! We are
   pitiable beings! Oh, boast not, Believer! Be not loud in praise of
   yourself! Put your finger on your lips and be silent when you hear that
   God pities you! The next time carnal security would creep in, or
   fleshly conceit would get the upper hand of you, remember that while
   you are boasting, God is pitying--and while you are triumphing, He is
   looking down upon you with pitying eyes of compassion, for He finds
   reason for compassion when you can only see cause for glorying!

   Our subject then, Beloved, will be a review--a review of our lives--if
   we are the Lord's children and fear Him. I hope it will be profitable
   to us. It will not be profitable through the newness of the thoughts,
   but rather by "stirring up your pure minds by way of remembrance," to
   look back upon all the ways whereby the Lord your God has led you.
   "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that
   fear Him." First of all, notice the displays of this pity. Then, the
   spirit of this pity. And then, lastly, note the objects of this pity.

   I. Notice THE DISPLAY OF THIS PITY. "Like as a father pities his
   children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." When does a father
   display pity towards his child? I answer--on many and divers occasions.

   Sometimes, the father's pity is bestowed upon the child's ignorance.
   He, himself, knows a thing which is, to his child, a profound mystery.
   He knows a certain truth which is, to him, an axiom and an element of
   his knowledge. But to his child it seems like the apex of the pyramid
   of knowledge--he wonders how he can ever attain to so high a pitch of
   learning! And, oh, how foolish are the child's surmises! How long he is
   guessing at truth and how mistaken are the axioms which he founds upon
   his mistakes of thought! And how the father pities the child if he
   falls among bad companions who teach him errors, who, instead of
   filling his mind with truth, fill it with lies! When he comes to his
   father with all those strange stories, with which wicked men have
   filled his little ears, the father pities him that he should be so
   ignorant as to be carried away by every wind of tattling--that he
   should receive every talker into his confidence and believe everything
   because man has said it, taking every man's opinion and believing what
   any man declares to be right!

   So, when, in the plentitude of our supposed wisdom, we think ourselves
   infallible, God looks down on our wisdom as being childish folly! When,
   in the glory of our wondrous eloquence, we talk great things, God looks
   down upon us as upon the prattler, who talks fast, but talks foolishly.
   And, often, when we come before our fellows and spread before them
   wondrous discoveries that we have made, He that sits in the heavens
   does not laugh in derision, but He smiles in compassion that we should
   think ourselves so wise in having discovered nothing, and so supremely
   learned in having found out untruths!

   And how God must pity His dear family when He finds them led astray by
   false doctrine and error! How many there are of God's people who go up
   to houses of prayer, so-called, where, instead of hearing the Truths of
   the Kingdom of Heaven, they are taught all kinds of strange
   things--where they hear "another gospel, which is not another, but
   there are some that trouble them." Where all the isms and fancies of
   man are preached, instead of the Truth of God, in all its
   discrimination, in all its power, in all its constancy and
   everlastingness and the power of its application to the soul by the
   Spirit of God. How God pities some of His children who are thus led
   astray! One of them, perhaps, says of their minister, "Is he not
   intellectual? Is he not a wonderful minister? Though he said nothing
   about Jesus Christ, today, yet it was such a clever discourse! It is
   true, he did not preach God's Gospel, but, then, see how beautifully he
   cleared up that point of metaphysics! It is quite certain that he did
   not lead me to hold more fellowship with my Redeemer, but then how
   excellent was that distinction which he drew between those two similar
   terms which he employed!"

   Another says, "I never heard a man so clever as my minister! I will not
   go and hear any of those vulgar preachers who talk to their hearers in
   a way that servant girls and mechanics can understand. I like to hear
   my minister, for he is so profoundly wise, that I do not believe there
   are many people in the chapel beside myself who can appreciate him! I
   will still go and hear him, dear man, though he does puzzle me,
   sometimes, so that I do not know what on earth he is talking about, and
   when he has finished his discourse, it has been such a perplexing one,
   that I have lost my way, and said, 'Dear me, the time is gone and I
   wonder what the sermon has been all about!'"

   God pities His children when they are in this position. He does not
   pity them when they hear His Truth--when they have real Gospel fare,
   however roughly the meat may be carved, and however it may be served up
   on the coarsest platter that human speech can supply. He pities them
   not when they get such spiritual food as that--but He does pity them
   when they are misguided, when they are carried away by "philosophy,
   falsely so called," being misled by the seeming wisdom of man which,
   after all, is but folly, having nothing of wisdom in it--the highest
   wisdom being that of believing what God has said, receiving God's Truth
   simply as God's Truth and asking no questions about it. God pities His
   children, however, in all their ignorance. He is not angry with them,
   nor does He speak sharply to them, but He leads them on by His Spirit
   until they understand His Truth and receive His Word.

   It were well, however, if there were nothing else but ignorance to bear
   with, but the parent often has something worse than that to suffer from
   his child--he has to endure the disobedience and waywardness of human
   nature. There is the continual uprising of evil passions, the perpetual
   proneness to disobedience, the frequent wandering from the path of
   righteousness and, oftentimes, the father has to pass that by with,
   perhaps, just a little admonition, but without a frown, without a sharp
   word, without a blow--he has to say, "My Child, it is all forgiven
   you"--and though his temper may be sorely tried, yet he has patience
   with his child, for he pities the child's disobedience. He knows, too,
   that he was once a child, himself, and then he did the same as his
   child is now doing and, therefore, does he have patience with his child
   and he pities him. My Brothers and Sisters, what pity has the Lord had
   upon you and me, in all our wanderings! How often have we gone astray
   and yet, compared with our wanderings, how seldom have we been
   chastised! How frequently have we broken His Commandments and rebelled
   against His Covenant and yet how light have been the strokes of
   chastisement, compared with the weight of our guilt, and how seldom has
   He afflicted us, compared with the frequency of our transgressions! How
   has He had patience with all our shortcomings and has bid His hand be
   still, when, if it had been like ours, it would have risen in hot anger
   to smite us to the dust! Truly, He has pitied us, "like as a father
   pities his children," only with a far greater patience! Even as He is,
   Himself, infinitely greater than all earthly fathers, so has His pity
   been more continuous, more patient and more long-suffering than the
   pity of any human parent who has ever breathed.

   And as a father pities his child, not only in all his disobedience, but
   in all his actual transgressions and downright sin--when he grows from
   the mere wish to do evil up to the actual commission of the crime--like
   as a father still pities his child, even when his follies have ripened
   into the worst of guilt, so has God pitied us, my Brothers and Sisters,
   when we have gone into gross sin before our conversion. Yes, and some
   of us even after it! When we have gone astray like lost sheep, have
   broken the hedges of His commands, and have gone rambling over the dark
   hills of transgression, still has He had pity upon us. It is amazing
   how far a father's pity will go towards his child, even when he has
   transgressed ever so much. There are some who have shut the door in
   their children's face and bid them never enter their house again, nor
   come near them. They have ceased to speak of them, for they have
   determined that they would never take their names on their lips again,
   nor consider them their children.

   But such fathers are, I trust, very few in number. It is rarely that we
   meet with them. A father usually endures much, and endures long. After
   he has had the peace of his home destroyed and his gray hairs almost
   brought with sorrow to the tomb. After his family has been made a wreck
   and he has lost almost everything he had, by the profligacy of his
   son--still his love, tenacious to the last, holds to his boy and will
   not let him go. And even when others speak harshly of him, the old man
   palliates his son's guilt--perhaps a little foolishly--but if he can
   find an excuse for him, he does. He will not have it that his son is
   worse than others and he will allow no man to make his son's guilt
   appear greater than it is--in fact he will, as far as he can, try to
   make it seem less.

   Our Heavenly Father is not foolishly pitiful, but He is pitiful. Yes,
   and He is better than that! He is wisely pitiful over the most erring
   of His children. Our God is no Arminian god--the Arminian's god is a
   pitiless god to his children. He is represented as being pitiful enough
   to all the world, but pitiless to his own children, for, according to
   the teaching of some, when they sin, he cuts them out of the covenant!
   And if they transgress, he bundles them out of doors, tells them they
   are not his children any longer and, because of their transgressions,
   he will have it that they are none of his and shall be damned at last,
   despite the fact that Christ has died for them, that the Holy Spirit
   has regenerated them and that they have been justified! He casts them
   away from his presence and they are to be lost forever! He is a
   pitiless god, but the god of these people is no relation to our God!

   We do not believe in their god, nor do we fear him, nor bow before him.
   Our God is constant in His affection and merciful towards His children!
   When they go astray, He pities all their guilt and sin. It is true, He
   takes the rod in His hand and, sometimes, causes us to weep bitterly by
   reason of the soreness of His chastisement. He applies the rod to our
   very soul and brings the iron into our inmost spirit. He makes us
   smart, and cry, and groan, and sigh, but all He does is in pity because
   He is determined to save us. He will not let us go unpunished because
   He pities us for our folly and sin. Just as the physician will not let
   the man go without his medicine because he pities him in his disease,
   so God will not let His children go without His chastisement because He
   pities them in their sin. And mark, too, even that chastisement is one
   of pity--there is not one twig too many in the rod, nor one stroke over
   the right number, nor one drop of gall too much--and that drop is none
   too bitter. The affliction is all measured out and weighed in balances
   and scales, all given as it should be--no more than what is necessary.
   God pities His children in all their chastisement and pities them in
   all their guilt and wanderings--and He will not let them go away from
   Him altogether, nor will He suffer them to perish, for He pities them
   still.

   God also pities His children in sickness. That is a time when a father
   pities his children very much. It does not say, "Like as a mother
   pities her children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." And I
   think the reason is not because a mother's pity is less intense, or
   less affectionate--for it is more so, by far--but because it is
   sometimes less effectual than the father's. A mother may pity her
   child, yet she may not be able to preserve it from an enemy. The mother
   may pity her child when it is sick, but she may be alone in the house
   and she may not be able to travel far enough to find a physician and,
   therefore, God has put in, not merely the affection, but the strength
   of pity. "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them
   that fear Him." On the bed of sickness, the strength of pity is proved
   by Christ upon God's people. He does not stand, as the mother would, to
   weep over the child, but He does more than that. He does give true
   compassion, He does sympathize, but, more than that, He heals! He makes
   the wounded spirit whole. He removes the aching pain from the
   conscience, binds up the broken heart, makes the weak to be strong and
   the faint one to rejoice! He gives us the strength of pity and some of
   us can remember that strength of pity when, in our sickness, we lay
   tossing in our beds, without hardly power to pray--when we said our
   heart and our flesh had failed us, and we must die. When our brain was
   racked with discordant thoughts and reason seemed to have left its
   throne, and blank despair held carnival within our brain, which, for a
   while, was under the dominion of the Lord of Misrule and revelry was
   perpetually kept up there. It was then, when we could do nothing, that
   Jesus came to us, not merely with the faint whispers of compassion, but
   with the strong voice of healing, bade our fears be still, comforted
   our aching heart and then made our flesh leap for joy because our
   spirit, its twin sister which had been broken on the wheel, was
   delivered from the tormentor and made perfectly whole! Thus the Lord
   pities His children! He specially pities us in all our sicknesses.

   And, my Brothers and Sisters, your Heavenly Father pities you who are
   His children under all your manifold trials, of whatever kind they are,
   and from whatever quarter they proceed. Thus, when persecuted, you have
   had His pity-- when the jeer and taunt of the ungodly have been cast
   upon you--and when worse than that has been attempted against you. When
   you have had to bear the brunt of poverty, you have had God's pity shed
   upon you. And you have had a pity, too, that was not barely that of
   words--you have had the pity of help. He has given you your bread in
   your extremity and made your water sure when the brook was dry. You who
   have lost your friends and have had to weep over numerous bereavements.
   You who have mourned over your family who have been swept away, one
   after another, not once have you been bereaved without the pity of your
   God! Never once has the clay fallen on the coffin lid, with the sad
   message, "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust," without the pity of your God
   falling on your heart, like gentle dew from Heaven! He has always
   pitied you in your low estate. He has always been with you in all your
   varied troubles and has never left you--

   "'Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints"-- He has kept by
   your side and led you all through your journey. And here you can raise
   your Ebenezer and write the words of our text upon it, "Like as a
   father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him, and
   He has pitied me up to this hour!"

   Yet once more, sometimes God's people have wrongs and a father pities
   His children, if they have wrongs that are unrevenged. I know a father
   who sometimes says, "If you strike me, you may strike me again. I will
   turn the other cheek to you and you may smite me as long as you please.
   But," says that good man, and he is a man of peace, too--like myself, a
   thorough man of peace, though a little inconsistent--"strike my
   children and I will knock you down if I can! I will not have you meddle
   with them. If you hit me, I will not resist you. You may do what you
   please with me. But if you smite my children, that I can never endure!
   I love them so, that I should break through every principle to resent
   it! So strong is my natural affection for them that though I might
   conceive myself to be wrong in what I did, I should do it, most
   certainly!"

   Depend upon it, there is nothing that brings a man's wrath up like
   touching his children! And the same thing is true of God. You may curse
   Him and He will not be so angry with you as if you touch His children.
   The prophet Zechariah declared to His ancient people, "He that touches
   you, touches the apple of His eye." If any of you want to know the
   shortest road to damnation, I will tell you--despise God's little ones!
   Treat God's people ill and you will damn yourself by express! Remember
   our Lord's words, "But whoever shall offend one of these little ones
   which believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were
   hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the
   sea."

   There never was a wrong done to one of God's people that God did not
   avenge! There has never been an ill deed done towards them yet but He
   has punished the doer of it. Though He suffered Assyria to break Israel
   in pieces, yet let Assyria speak, when she rises from her tomb, and
   tell how terribly God has shivered her with a rod of iron because she
   vaunted herself against the people of the Most High. Let old Rome
   testify that on her still rests the blood of the martyrs. Behold, our
   God has broken her empire in pieces! The Roman emperor has ceased to
   exist and his gaudy pomp is gone. Yes, and modern Rome, too, has an
   awful doom yet to come--she, above all other cities--has a fearful
   future before her. She, that is wrapped in scarlet and sits on the
   seven hills, the Whore of Babylon, drunk with the blood of the saints,
   shall yet meet the doom foretold in the Revelation. Lo! God has said
   it! She shall be torn in pieces! She shall be burnt with fire and
   utterly consumed! God might have forgiven her if it had not been for
   the blood of the martyrs--but the blood of His children cries out
   against her and the curse of God rests upon her! The Church of Rome can
   never again be put in the ranks of Christian churches! God has forgiven
   other Churches their sins and, despite errors in their doctrine and
   their practice, He has kept them among the living Churches. But of the
   Romish Babylon He has said, "She has made her garments red with the
   gore of My children; she has stained her hands with the blood of the
   saints; she shall be cut off, once and for all, and be forever cast
   away! Come out of her, My people, lest you be partakers of her plagues
   and share in her fearful doom!" God pities His children! No martyr has
   died unpitied, nor shall any martyr die unavenged! Springing from their
   graves, they cry, "Revenge, revenge, upon the apostate church of Rome!"
   And it shall be had. Lo! The souls of the saints beneath the altar cry,
   "How long, O Lord, how long?" Not long shall it be! The sword is being
   made ready in Heaven. It is furbished and the God that pities them that
   fear Him shall not let His hands spare, nor His eyes pity, when He
   comes to avenge Himself upon the church that has dyed its garments with
   the blood of His elect!

   II. And now, dear Friends, leaving that part of the subject, I want you
   briefly to notice THE SPIRIT OF GOD'S

   PITY.

   There are different sorts of pity. Some I would not have at any price
   whatever. Did you ever see the pity of contempt? Have you not often
   seen a gentleman watching a poor man doing something or other, and then
   saying to him, "Poor fellow, I do pity you"? Have you ever seen a very
   respectable aristocrat who has never heard anything but the most
   "proper" kind of preaching, turn on his heels and go out of a Chapel
   door, saying, "Well, I do pity people who can listen to such stuff as
   that"? We have often seen that pity of contempt. But that is not God's
   kind of pity! He never pities His people in the way of contempt and a
   father never so pities his children. Sometimes, when a boy is writing a
   copy, a stranger goes through the school and says, "Well, he is an
   ignoramus," and he pities him, perhaps--but there is a sneer with his
   pity. But the lad's father comes into the room. The boy has just got
   into pot-hooks and hangers and the father thinks he makes them very
   well for such a little boy. He pities him, perhaps, that he is not able
   to write better, but there is no contempt with his pity. Nor is there
   any contempt with God's pity--He sees what we are and pities us--but
   there is not a solitary grain of contempt for any of His people in His
   pity.

   Other people's pity is the pity of inaction. "Oh, I do pity you very
   much!" says a person to a sick woman, "your husband is dead, your
   children have to be supported and you have to work hard. Well, my good
   Woman, I pity you very much, but I cannot afford to give you anything.
   I have so many who call upon me." How much pity there is of that kind
   in the world! You can get pity of that sort in abundance. If you lift
   the knocker of the first door you come to, you will get plenty of pity
   of that kind. Pity is the cheapest thing in the world if that is all.
   But God's pity is not pity of that sort--it is not the pity which is
   mere pity, it is not the pity of inaction--but, when His heart moves,
   His hands move, too, and He relieves all the needs of those He pities.

   And let me say, again, God's pity is not a pity of mere sensitiveness.
   The other day a gentleman, talking of accidents, said in my hearing, "I
   saw a boy running down a lane where a cab was coming at a very rapid
   rate. I saw that the boy must be crushed under the horse's feet, or
   under the wheels. I stood for a moment thunderstruck and then I saw him
   crushed to pieces under the wheels! I ran down the next street in a
   moment. I was so sensitive, I could not bear the sight." Instead of
   seeing what help he could give, he ran away. "Yet," he said, "I did not
   do that from any lack of sympathy, or any lack of pity, and when I
   stopped myself, I thought it useless to go back, for I am so sensitive
   that I naturally avoid every sight of misery." That is not God's way of
   showing pity! His pity is not the pity of the stranger who ran away!
   God's pity is the pity of the father--it is not the pity of the mere
   sensation of the moment, but the pity which desires to do something to
   relieve his children in distress--

   "The pity of the Lord, To those that fear His name, Is such as tender
   parents feel-- He knows our feeble frame."

   Then, tried Believer, take your case before your God tonight in prayer.
   He is a God of pity and not a God of man's pity. Go to Him, now, if you
   are poor. Tell Him all your care and see if He will not help you. Go
   and tell Him that your spirit is depressed and see if He will not cheer
   you. Tell Him that your way is hedged up and that you cannot find your
   path, and see if He will not direct you. Tell Him you are ignorant and
   know nothing, and see if He will not teach you. Tell Him you have
   fallen and see if He will not set you on your feet, take you by the arm
   and teach you to go tell Him you are black by reason of your falls--and
   see if He will not wash and cleanse you. Tell Him that you cut yourself
   against a stone when you fell and see if He will not bathe your sores.
   Tell Him you are distressed because you have sinned and see if He will
   not kiss you with the kisses of His love and tell you He has forgiven
   you. Go and try Him, for His pity is a heavenly pity! It is the very
   ointment of Paradise that heals sores effectually!

   III. I close, by noticing THE PEOPLE WHOM GOD PITIES. Who are the
   objects of God's pity? "The Lord pities them that fear Him."

   Some of you He does not pity at all--you that do not fear Him, but
   trifle with Him. You that hate Him. You that despise Him. You that are
   careless about Him. You that never think of Him--you have none of His
   pity. When you are sick, He looks upon your sickness as something that
   you deserve. When you go astray, He looks upon your wandering as a mere
   matter of course of your guilty nature--and He is angry with
   you--wrathful with you! Your afflictions are not strokes of His rod,
   they are cuts of His sword! Your sins are not things that He overlooks,
   but if you die as you now are, guilty and unsaved, remember that even
   when you are cast away by God, justice shall look upon you with
   tearless eyes and say to you, "You knew your duty, but you did it not."
   And the stern voice of God shall, because you have been desperately
   guilty, drive you away from His Presence forever! Think not that this
   text will afford you any consolation in this life, or in that which is
   to come! You shall not have even a drop of water to cool your tongue in
   Hell--no pity shall be shed upon you there. If you could have pity
   bestowed upon you in the regions of your punishment, it might fall like
   a shower of gentle rain upon your tongues. But God bestows no pity upon
   you that love Him not, fear Him not and turn not from the error of your
   ways.

   Oh, that you would but fear Him! Would to God that He would make you
   fear Him now! Oh, that you would tremble at His Presence and then, oh,
   that you could know yourselves to be His children and fear Him as
   children do their parents! Oh, that you did reverence His name and keep
   His Sabbaths! Oh, that you did obey His Commandments and have His fear
   always before your eyes! Then should your peace be like a river and
   your righteousness like the waves of the sea. Oh, that you were wise to
   bow yourselves before Him and to confess your guiltiness! Oh, that you
   would come, "just as you are, without one plea," to Jesus Christ! Oh,
   that you were stripped of every rag of self-righteousness and clothed
   in the righteousness of Christ! Then you would have Christ as your
   Savior and you might rejoice that, henceforth, He would pity you in all
   your sicknesses and in all your wanderings! He would pity you here, and
   at last lead you up to be where pity shall be unneeded--in the land of
   the blessed, in the home of the hereafter where the weary rest and the
   wicked cease from troubling.

   But they do not cease from trouble in Hell. They are troubled without
   pity, pained without compassion, scourged without any leniency and
   damned without an iota of mercy, being left to stern justice and
   inflexible severity! Seeing that they would not turn at God's reproof
   and would not heed His warnings, but cast His Truth behind their
   backs--seeing that, being often reproved, they hardened their
   necks--they were, therefore, "suddenly destroyed, and that without
   remedy." Seeing that they have destroyed themselves. Seeing that they
   have rejected the invitations of the Gospel. Seeing that they have
   despised the Son of God. Seeing that they have loved their own
   righteousness better than Christ's and preferred Hell to Heaven, the
   penalties of iniquity to the reward of the righteous--therefore,
   without pity they shall be shut away, forever, from the regions of
   happiness and banished from the Presence of Him who pities them that
   fear Him, but punishes them that fear Him not! The Lord save us all
   from such a terrible doom as that, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM25.

   Verse 1. Unto You, O LORD, do I lift up my soul It is down and I would
   gladly lift it up, yet I am powerless to do so if I am left to myself.
   When the soul cleaves to the earth, who but God can lift it up? Yet it
   must be our desire and objective to seek to lift up our soul unto God.

   2. O my God, I trust in You: let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies
   triumph over me. Whatever happens to me, I trust in You. Down goes the
   anchor--that ship will never drift far out to sea. "O my God, I trust
   in You." Can you say that, dear Friends? Then if you are in the dark,
   you are as safe as if you were in the light, for still this anchor
   holds! "O my God, I trust in You." "Let not my enemies triumph over
   me." They will do so if they can get me back into the world. If they
   can seduce me from the paths of holiness, what shouts of joy there will
   be in the camp of the enemy! "Hold me up, and I shall be safe."

   3. Yes, let none that wait on You be ashamed: let them be ashamed which
   transgress without cause. When good men are in earnest on their own
   account, they soon begin to pray for others and the evil which they
   dread for themselves, they are sure to dread for their Brothers and
   Sisters. David first prayed, "Let me not be ashamed." And then he
   added, "Let none that wait on You be ashamed." The only shame that is
   worth having is a blessed shame--the shame of true repentance which
   sorrows over past sin, of which it is ashamed. Alas, there will be an
   eternal shame which shall cover those who choose the ways of sin!

   4. Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths. That is the prayer
   of one who is taught of the Spirit, for, by nature, our desire is to
   have our own way and if we can have our own way, we are satisfied. But
   when the Lord has taught us better, our prayer is, "Show me Your ways,
   O Lord; teach me Your paths."

   5. Lead me in Your truth, and teach me: for You are the God of my
   salvation; on You do I wait all the day. We need not only to have the
   path shown to us, but to be led into it, for we are like babes just
   learning to walk--we must have a finger that we may hold, or a hand
   that we may lean upon. "Lead me in Your truth, and teach me." That is
   the second time that David has prayed for the Lord to teach Him--and as
   long as we are here, we also shall need to pray, Teach me. What is a
   disciple but a learner? His daily cry must be, "Teach me: for You are
   the God of my salvation." There is another grip of the hand of faith. I
   have taken You to be my salvation, O my God! I trust nowhere else, "On
   You do I wait all the day," expecting everything from You--tarrying
   Your leisure, but tarrying hopefully, expecting to be blessed.

   6. Remember, O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your loving kindnesses;
   for they have been ever of old. Your saints knew them before I was
   born, and I have known them since I have been born again. By the
   constancy of Your kindness to me to now, continue to bless me, for are
   You not an unchanging God?

   7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according
   to Your mercy remember me for Your goodness' sake, O LORD. In this
   verse and the preceding one, there are three, "remembers"--first, that
   God would remember His tender mercies and His loving kindnesses. Next,
   that He would notremember our sins and our transgressions and, then,
   that He would remember us according to His mercy and goodness. This
   last request may remind us of the prayer of the dying thief, "Lord,
   remember me." And it may serve for us as a repenting prayer. "According
   to Your mercy remember me for Your goodness' sake, O Lord."

   8. Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will He teach sinners in the
   way. If good men endeavor to make others good, much more will the good
   God do so. A good man will seek to lead sinners in the right way and
   much more will our good Savior, and God, and Helper do so. Only let us
   be willing to be taught and come to Him confessing our ignorance, and
   asking to be led and instructed. This Psalm, you see, dear Friends, is
   all about teaching--and as David needed instruction, so do we! The next
   verse deals with the same subject.

   9. The meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His
   way. Not the proud man, but the meek--the learners--the teachable ones!
   Those who, like little children, are willing to believe what they are
   told upon true authority. Oh, that we all may be among the meek! The
   tender-mouthed horse is easy to drive, but some people are so stubborn
   and obstinate that they are "as the horse, or as the mule which have no
   understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle." Oh,
   that we were sensitive to the slightest touch of the Divine hand and
   always ready and anxious to be instructed by the Lord!

   10. All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep His
   Covenant and His Testimonies. Do you believe that, you who have been
   sorely tried? If you are resting in Covenant love, and find your hope
   in Covenant blood and Covenant promises, you must believe that
   everything God does to you is done in mercy and truth. Yes, though He
   strikes till every blow of the rod leaves a blue wound, yet we rejoice
   in these tokens of His fatherly love and desire for our highest good,
   for He has said, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten." The word,
   "love," in that passage conveys the idea of a very tender and ardent
   affection.

   11. For Your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my iniquity; for it is great
   Those who are not taught of God pray very differently from that, for
   their prayer is, "O Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is little." But he
   who is graciously instructed confesses the greatness of his guilt and
   out of that he draws a plea for mercy, for is not God a great God, and
   is it not greatly to His Glory to pardon great sinners? And when they
   are pardoned, are they not filled with a great love and a great zeal,
   so that they are greatly serviceable to their Lord and Master?

   12. What man is he that fears the LORD? Him shall He teach in the way
   that He shall choose. True reverence for God, a holy fear of Him, is a
   quality that God delights to see. And wherever He finds it, there He
   gives further instruction.

   13. 14. His soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the
   earth. The secret of the LORD is with them that fear Him; and He will
   show them His Covenant Are you one of those trembling ones who fear to
   offend God? Well, I daresay that you sometimes envy those who are very
   boisterous in their joy. Do not envy them--you have something better in
   having that holy, filial fear that trembles at God's Word--and you
   shall have the secret of the Lord with you and He will show you His
   Covenant.

   15. My eyes are eyes toward the LORD; for He shall pluck my feet out of
   the net When they get into it, He will pluck them out of it. When Satan
   seems to cast a net over me, God will come and pull me out. There is
   force in that word, "pluck"--denoting swiftness and energy. And,
   perhaps, there is a little idea of roughness, but God's roughness is
   true tenderness.

   16. Turn You unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
   afflicted. If you pass that dish round, there are some who will not
   help themselves from it, for they are not "desolate and afflicted." But
   I know that there are some, even here, who are both "desolate and
   afflicted." Be sure, dear Friends, that you make this prayer your
   own--"Turn You unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
   afflicted."

   17. 18. The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring You me out of
   any distresses. Look upon my affliction and my pain. And what follows?
   "Take the affliction and the pain away"? No!

   18. And forgive all my sins. David will be quite content if God will
   but look with pitying eyes upon his sufferings, but, as for his sins,
   he must be clean rid of them--he cannot be happy until he has the
   answer to this petition--"Forgive all my sins."

   19. Consider my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel
   hatred. The better the man, the more bitterly is he hated by the
   ungodly. It is not by holiness that you will escape the hatred of the
   world--it is by that very thing that you will awaken its malice! Do not
   wish to have it otherwise, but remember your Lord's own words, "Woe
   unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their
   fathers to the false prophets." But, "Blessed are you when men shall
   hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and
   shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of
   Man's sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy: for, behold, your
   reward is great in Heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers
   unto the Prophets." If we live near to God and are truly the seed of
   the woman, the seed of the serpent will constantly be nibbling at our
   heels--some little viper or other will be sure to be there! As the
   great serpent seeks to do us injury, so will his seed.

   20. O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my
   trust in You. Do you notice how David gets back to his keynote? Almost
   at the beginning of the Psalm, he said, "O my God, I trust in You." Now
   he says "I put my trust in You." Let faith in God be the keynote of
   your life Psalm! At another time, David wrote, "Trust in the Lord, and
   do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed."
   That is the motto for all Christians--"Trust, trust, TRUST!" When there
   is nothing to be seen, when you are in thick Egyptian darkness, let
   Job's confident declaration be the resolve of your spirit, "Though He
   slay me, yet will I trust in Him."

   21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on You. The
   child of God cannot hope to pass through the world safely unless he is
   careful to keep his integrity and his uprightness. There are some who
   profess to be Christians who try to get on in trade by various
   tricks--and they hope to win the favor of men by just bending a little
   to their ways. Never do so, Beloved! If you give way an inch, you will
   have to give way a yard or a mile before long!

   22. Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. God did so Himself
   to Israel. Jacob, whose name was also, Israel, said, "All these things
   are against me." Yet God redeemed him out of his troubles! And so will
   the Lord do for all His people in due time, glory be unto His name,
   world without end! Amen.

Comforted and Comforting

   (No. 2640)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1899,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   15, 1882.

   "Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
   of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforts us in all our
   tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God." 2
   Corinthians 1:3, 4.

   THE Apostle was a much-tried man and he lived in an age when all
   Believers were peculiarly tried. The persecutions of that time were
   excessively severe and every man who called himself a Christian had to
   carry his life in his hands. In this tribulation, the Apostle had the
   largest share, because he was the most prominent and indefatigable
   teacher that the Church of Christ then possessed. We have, here, a
   little insight into his inner life. He needed comfort and he received
   it. And be had it in such abundance that he became a comforter of
   others. Although, without Christ, he would have been, "of all men most
   miserable," I think I may say that with Christ and the blessed hope of
   the Resurrection, he was among all men, one of the most happy.

   In our text there are four things of which I would speak to you, dear
   Friends, hoping that they may bring good cheer to any who are cast
   down. The first is the comforting occupation in which Paul was
   employing himself--he was blessing God. "Blessed be God." Then,
   secondly, we have the comforting titles which he gives to God--"The
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Father of mercies and the God of
   all comfort." Truly, they who know the Lord's name do put their trust
   in Him. Paul knew the name of God right well and he used the most
   appropriate name for the time of sorrow. Then, thirdly, we shall have
   to consider for a little while the comforting fact which the Apostle
   here states, "Who comforts us in all our tribulation." And, lastly, we
   shall try to see the comforting design of it all--"That we may be able
   to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
   ourselves are comforted of God."

   I. First, then, you who mourn and are troubled and cast down, are
   invited to consider THE COMFORTING OCCUPATION of the Apostle.

   Most of Paul's 14 Epistles begin with praise to God and he often breaks
   out into a doxology when you are hardly expecting it. He lays down his
   pen, bows his knees to the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ and
   pours out a flood of thanksgiving to the Most High. Here was a man who
   never knew but what he might be dead the next day, for his enemies were
   many, and cruel, and mighty. And yet he spent a great part of his time
   in praising and blessing God!

   This comforting occupation argues that his heart was not crushed and
   vanquished by his troubles. Paul was sore beset in many ways, yet he
   could say, and he did say, "Blessed be God." Job was greatly tried and
   sorely bereaved, but he still said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has
   taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." And as long as we can
   keep the blessing of God to the front, it is a sure sign that whatever
   the adversary may have been able to take away from us, he has not taken
   away our confidence, which has great recompense of reward and, whatever
   he may have crushed, he has not crushed our heart! He may have
   surrounded it with bitterness, but the heart itself is not made
   bitter--it is a fountain that sends out a stream of sweet waters, such
   as this utterance of the Apostle, "Blessed be God."

   It is glorious to see how the Grace of God will enable a man to endure
   all the assaults of the world, the flesh and the devil--how he will be
   laid aside by sickness and his pains will be multiplied. How reproach
   may go far to break his heart, how he may be depressed in spirit and
   lose all temporal benefits--and yet he will still be able to say,
   "Blessed be the name of the Lord." "Though He slay me, yet will I trust
   in Him." "Let Him do what He pleases with me, I have made no
   stipulation with Him that I will only praise Him when He does according
   to my will. I will praise Him when He has His own way with me, even
   though it runs exactly contrary to mine." It is a brave heart that
   still, under all pressures, gives forth only this cry, "Blessed be
   God." O dear Friends, if you want to keep up your hearts--if you desire
   to be established and sustained, if you wish to prevent the enemy from
   overcoming you--let this be your comfortable occupation and say with
   the poet--

   "I will praise You every day, Now Your anger's turned away."

   Nothing can keep your head above the waters of trouble better than
   crying, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless
   His holy name."

   This occupation shows that the Apostle had not gratified Satan, for the
   devil's purpose, so far as he has had to do with our trouble, is to
   make us "curse God and die." After all the sorrow that Satan was
   permitted to bring to Job, the Patriarch's heart still blessed the name
   of the Lord! So the devil was defeated--he could not carry out his own
   evil purpose and he had to slink away like a whipped cur--for Job
   glorified God instead of bringing dishonor upon His holy name. The
   tried and troubled ones who can still cry, "Blessed be the name of the
   Lord," are not driven to despair, for despair shuts the mouth and makes
   a man sit in sullen silence, or else it opens his lips in bitter
   complaints and in multiplied murmurings. But, when a man can truly say,
   "Blessed be God," then despair has not mastered him. He still holds his
   own and he has on his side a far greater force than the devil--and the
   most trying circumstances--can bring to bear upon him to vanquish him!
   O Friends, if you are afraid of being overcome, take to praising God!
   If you are in trouble and do not know how to bear it, divert your
   thoughts by praising God! Get away from the present trial by blessing
   and magnifying His holy name!

   Next, this state of mind which made the Apostle say, "Blessed be God,"
   prophesied that God would speedily send him something to call forth new
   praises. When a man blesses God for the bitter, the Lord often sends
   him the sweet. If he can praise God in the night, the daylight is not
   far off. There never was a heart that waited and wanted to praise God
   but the Lord soon gave it opportunities of lifting up Psalms and hymns
   and spiritual songs to Him. It shall never be said that we were ready
   to praise God, but that God was not ready to bless us! So, dear
   Friends, praise God and He will bless you! Praise God and exalt Him,
   and He will soon lift you up out of your troubles. I look upon a
   murmuring spirit as the forewarning of stormy weather in a rebellious
   soul--and I regard a praiseful spirit as the forecast of a happy time
   to come to the loyal joyous soul. God has prepared the heart to receive
   the joy which, otherwise, it might not have been fit to accept at His
   hands. Be comforted, then, dear Friends, if you find in your hearts the
   desire to praise God--and belief that the Lord will find in His heart
   the willingness to speedily bless you!

   This comforting occupation profits the Believer in many ways. One
   advantage of blessing God is that it takes a man's thoughts off his own
   trials and sorrows. We make our troubles much greater than they need be
   by turning them over, considering them from all points of view,
   weighing them and thinking and meditating upon them. You know very well
   that if you swallow a pill, you do not taste it--but if you get it
   between your teeth and bite and chew it, you will get all the bitter
   flavor of the drug. So, it is often a good thing to let our afflictions
   go right down into our soul, to swallow them at once, and say no more
   about them. God has sent them and, therefore, they are for your
   good--but when you keep brooding over your grief, you will probably
   hatch something out of it which you did not expect--it may be that you
   will find a young scorpion come from it to annoy you! They that will
   always be thinking upon their trials will soon find a sorrow within the
   sorrow which, haply, they might never have perceived if they had let it
   go! While we are blessing God, we are, at least for the time, taking
   our thoughts off our troubles and, so far, so good.

   Moreover, we shall, by God's gracious help, while we are praising Him,
   be lifting our soul out of our sorrow. In America, for many years they
   kept a day of fasting, but somebody suggested that they had better keep
   an annual day of thanksgiving--and they have done so ever since! The
   change was a good one and you and I, though sometimes we must fast,
   especially if the Bridegroom shall hide His face, will also find that
   it is a great improvement when we can turn our day of fasting into a
   day of thanksgiving! Do you not think, dear Friends, that sometimes,
   when you are very heavy of heart, it would be the best possible thing
   if you were to say, with Martin Luther, "Come, let us sing a Psalm and
   startle the devil"? If you sit down and groan and complain against God,
   your groans will be music to Satan's malevolent heart!

   But you will vex and grieve him, if, instead of doing so, you say, "No,
   foul fiend, you shall never persuade me to rob God of His Glory--He
   shall have His full revenue of praise from me, whether I am on my bed,
   sick, or able to be up and actively engaged in the duties of my
   calling. Whether I stand well with my fellow men, or my name has an ill
   savor to them, God's name has not an ill savor and, therefore, I will
   praise and bless Him even though nobody will praise me."

   O Beloved, if your heart is sad within you, praising God will so lift
   it up that you will even be able to forget the trouble of the present
   hour! What does the eagle do when the fowler is about with his net and
   gun? Why, the noble bird takes to his wings and flies upwards towards
   the sun! And, though his bright eyes can see the foe, he knows that no
   bullet can reach him at that great height. So, if you Christians have
   close communion with your God and praise and magnify His holy name, the
   shots of the enemy shall not reach you--you will have risen far beyond
   their range. Therefore, you see the excellence of blessing and praising
   the Most High.

   Besides, this occupation may well tend to take away the sorrows of our
   mortality, since, by praising God, we get a taste of the joys of
   immortality. What are the angels doing now? I cannot tell you what men
   all over the world are doing, but I can tell you what the angels are
   doing! The holy spirits before the Throne of God find it is their very
   Heaven to be always blessing their God! So, if you want a sip of
   Heaven's bliss. If on your leaf you would have a sparkling dew-drop
   which would tell you what the River of Life that flows at the right
   hand of God is like, commence at once to praise and bless the Lord your
   God--

   "I would begin the music here, And so my soul would rise! Oh for some
   heavenly notes to bear My passions to the skies!"

   And there is no better way of anticipating the joys of being there than
   by beginning the praises of God while here!

   You may also destroy your distresses by singing praises to God. By
   blessing the Lord, you may set your foot upon the neck of your
   adversaries--you can sing yourself right up from the deeps by God's
   gracious help. Out of the very depths you may cry unto the Lord till He
   shall lift you up and you shall praise Him in excelsis--in the very
   highest--and magnify His name! I give you this as one of the shortest
   and surest recipes for comfort--begin to praise God. The next time that
   a friend comes in to see you, do not tell him how long the wind has
   been blowing from the North, how cold the weather is for this season of
   the year, how your poor bones ache, how little you have coming in and
   all your troubles--he has probably heard the sad story many times
   before! Instead of that, tell him what the Lord has done for you and
   make him feel that the Lord is good. Your griefs and your troubles
   speak for themselves, but your mercies are often dumb--so try,
   therefore, to give them a tongue and praise the Lord with all your
   heart!

   II. Time would fail me if I dwelt, as I would like to dwell, upon the
   first point, so we must advance to the second, which is, THE COMFORTING
   TITLES which the Apostle gives to God in our text.

   The first title we may call a name of affinity--"Blessed be God, even
   the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Oh, how near that brings God to
   us--that He is the Father of Jesus, the Father of Christ, "the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ"--because Jesus has espoused our nature and
   become a Man. Though He is, "Light of light" and, "very God of very
   God," yet is He also our Brother! "Father of Jesus"--what a delightful
   title that is for the good and glorious God! The great Jehovah has
   become very near of kin to you, my sorrowing Brother, for His Son is
   your Brother, your Husband, your Head and, now, the Father of Jesus is
   the Father of every Believer, so He is your Father if you are one of
   those who trust His Son! A child may not have a penny in his pocket,
   yet he feels quite rich enough if he has a wealthy father. You may be
   very, very poor, but, oh, what a rich Father you have! Jesus Christ's
   Father is your Father! And as He has exalted His own dear Son, He will
   do the same for you in due time. Our Lord Jesus is the first-born among
   many brethren and the Father means to treat the other brethren even as
   He treats Him. Your Father has made you one of His heirs-- yes, a joint
   heir with Jesus Christ--what more would you have? Therefore, comfort
   yourself with this blessed Truth of God! If you are distressed and
   troubled, this fact--that God is Christ's Father and your Father--ought
   to be quite sufficient, by the blessing of the Holy Spirit, to fill you
   with intense joy!

   In addition to this name of affinity, Paul gives to God a title which
   is a name of gratitude--"The Father of mercies." Then every mercy I
   have ever had has been begotten of God, who is "the Father of mercies"!
   All temporal mercies come to God's people from their Father. It is He
   who gives us bread to eat and clothes to put on. We are happy to be
   able to see in these common mercies a peculiar touch of the benign
   hand. But as for the high and heavenly mercies, the everlasting
   mercies, the satisfying mercies--the soul-filling mercies--these all
   come from God! As every beam of light comes from the father of lights
   [the sun], so do all mercies come from God. As all the rivers would be
   dried up if the sea were dry--for that is the ultimate source of the
   earth's moisture--so would all our mercies be dried-up mercies, barren
   mercies, no mercies at all if they did not come from that great ocean
   of mercies, the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
   Well, now, Beloved, as your Father is "the Father of mercies," can you
   not go to Him for all the mercy you need? If your mercies seem, just
   now, to be very few, can you not go to the All-Merciful and ask Him to
   deal out to you from His abundant store, for, "His mercy endures
   forever"?

   The third title which Paul applies to God ought to afford the deepest
   possible consolation to your soul. I venture to call it a name of hope.
   "The God of all comfort." All sorts of comforts are stored up in God.
   No matter what you may require to bear you up under your affliction,
   God has just the kind of comfort which you need--and He is ready to
   bestow it upon you! Rest assured of that and also believe that He will
   bestow it upon you if you ask it at His hands. Oh, I think this is a
   name full of good cheer to everyone who has grown weary because of the
   trials of the way through this great and terrible wilderness! God is
   the God of all comfort--not merely of some comfort, but of allcomfort.
   If you need every kind of comfort that was ever given to men, God has
   it in reserve and He will give it to you! If there are any comforts to
   be found by God's people in sickness, in prison, in need, in
   depression--the God of all comfort will deal them out to you according
   as you have need of them!

   This title is also a name of discrimination. It applies both to the
   persons and to the comfort--"who comforts us...by the comfort wherewith
   we are comforted of God." There are some things which are called
   comforts of which God is not the dispenser. Alas, alas, how many
   persons there are who fly to the bottle when they are in distress! That
   is their comfort--they drink and, for a while, forget their misery--but
   the process only leads to still greater misery and degradation. We
   cannot say that God is the God of such comfort as that! Indeed, we do
   not reckon it to be comfort! Some there are who turn to dissipation
   that they may forget their grief. God is not the God of dissipation
   and, therefore, that is not a comfort to a child of God--it would only
   increase his misery. If he were to be dragged to it, it would not
   relieve his pains in the least. Whatever there is in the world--and
   there are many such things which men call comforts--if you cannot be
   sure that they are such as God sends, let them be no source of
   consolation to you, but rather regard them with horror! May every child
   of God be able to make this discrimination and say, "If God does not
   give me what I look upon as a comfort, it will not prove to be a
   comfort."

   It is not a creature who supplies the comfort, it is only the Creator.
   The comfort may be brought to us by a creature, and brought in God's
   name, but it must come from Him! The reason why bread feeds us is
   because God chooses to make it do so. When medicine heals us, it is
   because Jehovah makes it the means of healing. But if God does not work
   with the means, no cure will be worked. You who have the Creator,
   Himself, as your Comforter, are like the man who has a well in his
   garden--he may not have a tap to turn it off and on when he needs a
   supply of water to run through the pipe, but he has the well, itself,
   from which he may draw as much as he needs. Remember what we sang just
   now--

   "Why should the soul a drop bemoan, Who has a fountain near? A fountain
   which will always run With waters sweet and clear?"

   So much, then, upon the comforting titles which Paul uses in relation
   to God. I pray you to act like the bees when they dive into the petals
   of the flowers and suck out their honey--dive into these titles and
   extract the delicious honey which the Holy Spirit has stored there for
   you.

   III. Now, thirdly, I am to speak of THE COMFORTING FACT which Paul here
   mentions. "The God of all comfort .. .comforts us in all our
   tribulation."

   This was Paul's declaration and I, also, may speak in the name of many
   here present and say, "That is not only true of Paul, and the
   Christians in his day, but it is also true of us." The God of all
   comfort has comforted us in our tribulation. Look back, now, on the
   pages of your diary that bear the record of your sorrow--do they not
   also bear the record of the Lord's help in the sorrow and His
   deliverance from the sorrow? If I cannot speak for all of you, I will
   speak for myself. I must do so, or else surely the very timber on which
   I stand might cry out against me! The Lord has been very gracious to me
   in many an hour of affliction. Blessed be His name, He has never failed
   to bring the solace when He has made the smart--and if there has been
   the stroke with the rod, there has very soon been the caress of His
   love to follow the blow of His hand. It has been so with many of us.

   But Paul speaks in the present tense--"Who comforts us in all our
   tribulation"--and we can also declare that God is now comforting us who
   believe in Jesus. Did you, Beloved, come into this building somewhat
   heavy in spirit? You are not half so heavy, now, as you were--and if
   you will take the good advice I am trying to give, you will go away
   quite relieved. Rutherford used to say that the Cross of Christ was no
   more a burden to the man who knew how to carry it than wings are to a
   bird or sails are to a ship! An affliction is a help to us, not a
   hindrance, when Grace comes with it to sanctify it! Remember what David
   said, long ago--"Cast your burden upon the Lord and He shall sustain
   you: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." But if you cast
   your burden upon the Lord, do not go looking for it when I have
   pronounced the benediction--leave it altogether! The fault with many of
   us is that when we have cast our burden upon the Lord, we beg Him to
   let us have it back! And if He grants our foolish request, it comes
   back twice as heavy as it was before. Oh, that we were wise enough to
   leave our troubles with our Father who is in Heaven as little children
   leave things with their father! Then we shall find that He comforts us
   in all our tribulation.

   Yes, but our text is true of the future as well as the present. Here,
   if we cannot speak by experience, we can speak by faith. A little child
   who loves his father has no doubt about his father's comforting him
   next year as well as this. And you must have no doubt about what God
   will do for you, dear Friends, especially you aged ones. When the
   veterans begin to waver and doubt, I do not know what excuse to make
   for them. I remember the story of one who said she was afraid she would
   be starved. Someone asked her, "How old are you?" "Seventy-five," she
   replied. "How long have you been a Christian?" "Fifty years." "Your
   Heavenly Father has fed you these 50 years and yet you fear that He
   will let you starve during the last few years you are likely to be
   here?" It was very wrong of the poor old soul--mind that you do not
   imitate her! It is due to every honest man that we should speak of him
   as we have found him--but much more is it due to our faithful God! He
   has comforted, He is comforting and He wilcomfort. And Paul puts it in
   such a way as to make us feel that He will never leave off comforting
   us even for a single moment1 'Who comforts us in all our
   tribulation"--not in some of it, but in allof it! Our tribulations
   sometimes change and a new cross is generally a very heavy one. The old
   crosses get, at last, to fit the back and we can carry them better than
   we could at the first--but a new cross galls the shoulders that have
   not yet grown used to it. But the Lord your God will help you in your
   new tribulations as well as in your old ones! And if they come thick
   and threefold--tribulation upon tribulation, trouble upon
   trouble--still, as your days, so shall your strength be, and He who has
   comforted and is comforting, will continue to comfort you even to the
   last!

   IV. Now I must close with just a few remarks upon THE COMFORTING DESIGN
   of which our text speaks.

   Why does God lay trouble upon His people and comfort them in it? It is
   that He may make them comforters of oth-ers--"that we may be able to
   comfort them which are in any trouble." A man who has never had any
   trouble is very awkward when he tries to comfort troubled hearts.
   Hence, the minister of Christ, if he is to be of much use in God's
   service, must have great trouble. "Prayer, meditation, and affliction,"
   says Melanchthon, "are the three things that make the minister of God."
   There must be prayer. There must be meditation and there must be
   affliction. You cannot pronounce the promise correctly in the ears of
   the afflicted unless you, yourself, have known its preciousness in your
   own hour of trial. It is God's will that the Holy Spirit, the
   Comforter, should often work by men according to that ancient word of
   His, "Comfort you, comfort you My people, says your God. Speak you
   comfortably to Jerusalem." These comforting men are to be made--they
   are not born so--and they have to be made by passing through the
   furnace, themselves. They cannot comfort others unless they have had
   trouble and have been comforted in it.

   More than this, the intent of God is to make us able comforters--"that
   we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble." Some have the
   will to comfort the troubled, but they have not the power to do it.
   "Miserable comforters are you all," said Job to his friends! And the
   same has been said to many of those who have really tried to comfort
   the sorrowing, but who, in the process, have put their fingers into the
   open wounds and so made them worse instead of better. Brethren, the
   able comforter must be a man who knows both the trial and the promise
   that is suited to meet it.

   Beside that, we are to be ready comforters, for we are "to comfort them
   which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
   comforted of God." Experimental knowledge helps a man to speak with
   power to the afflicted soul. He who has taken a certain medicine and
   proved the benefit of it, is the man to recommend it to another.

   Hence, the Lord often passes His ministers through trials which they
   would never have to endure if it were not for their people. Even as
   upon the Chief Shepherd, all the wanderings of the flock had to be
   laid, so, in a very minor sense, the wanderings of the flock must be
   borne by the under-shepherd, or else he cannot be a comforter to them.
   Dear Friends, the next time you get into any trouble, I would recommend
   you to take notes of it and to ask yourself, when it is over, "How did
   God comfort me?" Lay that cordial up in store, because, one of these
   days, you will need that comfort, again, or, if not, you will meet with
   somebody who is in just the same fix as you were in--and you will be
   able to say, "I know what will help you, for I have it down in black
   and white at home, how God helped me in a trouble exactly like yours."

   As I was reading a book, this afternoon, this sentence struck
   me--"whenever you come into the mouth of the furnace, say to yourself,
   'God has some great work for me to do and He is preparing me for it.'"
   I thought to myself, "I have not often said that in the time of trial.
   My thoughts have been too much taken up with the furnace to think of
   the good which was to result from the fire." But I am sure that what
   that writer said is true--God means to do something more by us, which,
   speaking after the manner of men, He cannot yet do by us. We are not
   qualified for it. But He is going to put us through a still hotter
   furnace--the heat is to be more intense than any we have yet borne--and
   when we come out, we shall be more fit for the Master's use!

   Welcome your trials, then, Beloved! Open wide your doors and say to
   tribulations, "Come in, come in! This is the place where you are to
   lodge, for my Master said, 'In the world you shall have tribulation.'"
   Welcome even that black trouble that has a mask on its face--it is no
   adversary coming to kill you--when the mask is taken off, you will see
   that, underneath it there is a bright smiling face! Some of us can say
   to affliction, "Come in and welcome, for the costliest jewels we ever
   possessed were brought by you! You have done us more good than all our
   joys put together." We would have had no harvest if God had left us
   like the hard road outside the field. But the soil has been cut up by
   the sharp plow and often our very soul has been grievously tried as the
   harrow and the cultivator have gone over us, again and again! But all
   these processes have caused us to bring forth fruit to the praise and
   glory of God! Therefore, I say again, welcome your troubles! Do not be
   sorry if they travel with you for a while, for they are good guests.
   Many a time, by entertaining trouble, we have "entertained angels
   unawares." God bless you, Brothers and Sisters, by making you a comfort
   to others! And probably it will be through the very trials which
   greatly vex you!

   Now to close, there may be some poor soul here broken down under a
   sense of sin, some seeker who cannot find the Savior. He may speak to
   some of you who were brought to Christ without any strong emotion. He
   will begin telling you about his despair and you will look at him and
   say, "Dear me, where has this man come from?" Then do not try to help
   him, for you cannot--you have not had the experience through which he
   is passing. Go find the Brother who had a hard time of it in getting to
   the Wicket Gate, that poor fellow who tumbled into the Slough of
   Despond with his big burden on his back and nearly got choked in the
   mire. Say to him, "Brother Christian, here is another soul floundering
   about just as you were." Hand him over to such a person because he will
   be the most likely to help him. Any of you who had great difficulty in
   laying hold of Christ at the first ought to be on the watch to find
   others who are as you were--stretch out the helping hand to them and
   say, "We would not have you suffer as we did if we can help it. We wish
   to show you the way to Jesus Christ and to get you to see it more
   quickly that we did. We even hope that you will, this very night, find
   joy and peace in believing."

   Do look after the broken-hearted ones, dear Friends! Watch for Mr.
   Feeble-Mind. Be on the look-out for poor Mr. Fearing, do not let them
   lie outside long. Help them over the wall and, as you have found mercy,
   administer it, in the name of God, to all who are longing to find it!
   May God bless you all, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 CORINTHIANS 1:1-20.

   Verse 1. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. Paul is
   very careful to remind the Corinthians of that fact, since some of them
   had gone the length of denying his Apostleship altogether.

   1. And Timothy our brother Whom, in all humility, he associates with
   himself, although he was a younger man, of far less consequence. But
   Paul loved him very much and, therefore, he put his name at the
   beginning of this Epistle side by side with his own--"and Timothy our
   brother."

   I, 2. Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints
   which are in all Achaia: Grace be to you and peace from God our Father,
   and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Christianity is a religion of
   benedictions! Whereas worldly people often use the language of courtesy
   towards one another without meaning what they say, the saints of God
   put a fullness of meaning into their expressions and really wish every
   good thing to those to whom they write. "Grace be to you." That comes
   first, and then peace follows. Peace without Grace is a very dangerous
   possession. But a peace that grows out of the possession of Grace is a
   gracious peace and will lead to the peace of Heaven before long. This
   Grace and peace are to come "from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ." There is no Grace for us apart from the Lord Jesus
   Christ. And though the Father is full of love and will give Grace and
   peace to His people, yet the Lord Jesus Christ must always be the
   channel through which these incomparable favors must flow to them!

   3, 4. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforts us in all
   our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
   Nothing less, then, shall be given to the tried people of God than that
   same comfort which was enjoyed by the Apostle Paul! It shall be shared
   by all who are resting where Paul rested.

   5. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
   also abounds by Christ. The Apostles were the most tried, but they were
   the most comforted. They had to stand the brunt of the battle, but the
   Lord was their strength in a very special sense. Observe the balance in
   this verse--"as the sufferings," "so our consolation." And "as the
   sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by
   Christ." With little trial, we may expect little comfort. It is better
   to leave the whole matter entirely with God, or else we might almost
   desire to be dug about by the spade of affliction, that we might
   receive more of the living waters of consolation!

   6. And whether we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and
   salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
   which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted, it is for your
   consolation and salvation. That is the grand objective of Christians,
   to live for others! When God has helped us to receive both our comforts
   and our sorrows as matters of trust that we are to take care of for the
   benefit of our fellow Christians, then have we learned the lesson which
   Christ would teach us by them!

   7. And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers
   of the sufferings, so shall you also be of the consolation. How these
   things are put together! God does not call His people to the one
   without the other--no consolation without affliction and, blessed be
   His name, no affliction without consolation!

   8. For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
   came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
   strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life. Why would Paul have
   them know this but that they might understand that he had to suffer as
   they did, and even more? Sometimes God's people are apt to think that
   their ministers are not cast down as they are. They look upon them as a
   sort of superior order of beings who have no doubts and fears, no lack
   of strength, no despair. But that is an idle fiction and the sooner it
   is gone from our minds, the better! For those who lead the people of
   God will rather have more afflictions than less. Seeing that they need
   more instruction than others need, and that instruction usually comes
   with the rod--in all probability they will have more of the rod than
   others will. Paul, therefore, is anxious that the Corinthians should
   know in what seas of trouble he had to swim.

   9. 10. But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
   not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead: who delivered
   us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that He
   will yet deliver us. It is supposed by some that the Apostle was in
   danger of being put to death in same extraordinary way--perhaps by wild
   beasts in the amphitheatre. We know that he speaks of having fought
   with beasts at Ephesus. We cannot tell whether there is any allusion,
   here, to that trial, or what it was. But it was evidently some death
   which, to the Apostle, seemed to be exceedingly terrible. And when he
   was delivered from it, it was to him like a resurrection! He speaks of
   it as having been worked by God that raises the dead. And he puts down
   this deliverance, together with some other of which he was at that very
   time the subject--"and does deliver"--and upon these experiences he
   builds his expectation that God "will yet deliver."

   II. You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
   bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
   many on our behalf When many pray, after the blessings is received,
   many will give thanks. Paul rejoices to have been the object of
   interest to a large number of Christians everywhere in the time of his
   great peril. And when he escaped, he believed be would still be the
   object of their interest and that there would be more prayer in the
   world, and more praise, too, because of the dangers from which God had
   delivered him. It is worth while for any of us to be in sore sickness,
   or in great straits, if, thereby, the quantity of prayer and praise in
   the world shall be increased to God's Glory!

   12. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
   simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
   Grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, andmore
   abundantly to you. For to them he had been specially particular, that
   in no point they should speak of him as having used the wisdom of
   words. Among them he determined not to know anything except Jesus
   Christ and Him crucified. To them he was like the nurse who administers
   milk to babes.

   13. 14. For we write none other things unto you, than what you read or
   acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end; as also
   you have acknowledged us in part Some of them disputed his Apostleship,
   but most of them did not--

   14. That we are your rejoicing, even as you, also, are ours in the day
   of the Lord Jesus. What a happy condition of things it is when the
   teacher and the taught mutually rejoice in each other! When the teacher
   is the joy of the flock and when he can rejoice in his people! This is
   profitable to all, but when there are discards, and fault-finding and
   the like, this is neither glorifying to God nor profitable to the
   people.

   15-17. And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
   that you might have a second benefit; and to pass by you into
   Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to
   be brought on my way toward Judea. When I therefore was thus minded,
   did I use lightness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose
   according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes, and no,
   no? There were some in the Church at Corinth who said, "He promised to
   come and see us, but he did not keep his word." They declared that his
   promise could not be depended upon and that he very easily changed his
   mind. Now the Apostle had done nothing of the kind! He had solid
   reasons for his change of purpose and reasons full of love to them--but
   they misrepresented him. Do not, my dear Friends, count the fiery trial
   of misrepresentation to be any strange thing! Even some of those whom
   you have loved and for whom you have been willing to lay down your
   lives will turn against you! It is no new thing that they should do so.
   They may take anything which you have done in the simplicity of your
   heart and turn it against you. Whenever they do so, I say again, do not
   think that any strange thing has happened to you--it happened to
   Paul--then why should not you have a similar experience?

   18-20. But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no. For
   the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by
   me andSilvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in Him was yes. For
   all the promises of God in Him are yes, and in Him, Amen, unto the
   glory of God by us. Paul loved to turn from some lower subject to his
   Lord. When he wrote the words, "yes and no," they suggested to him the
   perfect constancy of the love of Christ and thankfulness for His
   faithful promises. So, as the thought came into his mind, he could do
   no other than put it into the Epistle he was writing, for he never
   missed an opportunity of praising the Lord Jesus Christ! I wish we
   could all imitate him, in this respect, far more than we have ever
   done, for, our Savior is worthy of all the praise we can ever give
   Him--and more, too!

God's Heart the Source of All Blessing

   (No. 2641)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   18, 1882.

   "According to Your own heart, have You done all these great things." 2
   Samuel 7:21.

   A FRIEND observed to me, just before the service, that after the
   earnest endeavor this morning to magnify the Grace of God, he did not
   want to hear any more for a week. He was perfectly satisfied with what
   he had heard and was only afraid lest the sermon of the evening should
   drive that of the morning out of his head. Well, dear Friends, that is
   my own fear, too! I never like driving one nail out by hammering
   another in and, really, what more can I say than I said this morning? I
   then poured out my inmost heart in endeavoring to extol the exceeding
   riches of God's Grace in His kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.
   [See Sermon #1665, Volume 28-- The Exceeding Riches of Grace.] This
   evening's discourse, therefore, is intended to be like a little
   supplement to the big book of the morning sermon--just a few additional
   words upon the theme that we considered then.

   As we read the chapter from which my text is taken, we noticed that
   David had a holy purpose in his grateful heart. He said to Nathan the
   Prophet, "I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within
   curtains." And he seemed to think that it was neglectful on his part to
   have suffered the Ark to remain so long unhoused, so he resolved to
   build for it, and for the worship associated with it, a Temple that
   would be "exceedingly magnificent." He had for years gathered together
   gold and silver and he meant to continue to do so, that he might erect
   a shrine for the Lord, his God, more glorious than any that had ever
   been built by the greatest heathen prince for his false deity! This was
   the thought which was in David's mind and he mused upon it, for it was
   very sweet to him. It was, in fact, the great ambition of his life that
   he might be permitted to build this house for the worship of Jehovah.
   Yet the Lord was not willing to accept the Temple at his hands, for
   David had been a man of war from his youth up--and God would not have
   His sanctuary built with blood-stained hands. However necessary those
   wars might have been for the liberation and defense of the chosen
   nation--and they certainly were so--yet, nevertheless, a man of peace
   must build the house for the God of Peace. And Solomon, the son of
   David, in whose reign there was no war, must have the honor of raising
   the great House of Prayer in the name of the Lord.

   Yet, dear Brothers and Sisters, observe that though the Lord refused to
   David the realization of his wish, he did it in a most gracious manner.
   He did not put the idea away from him in anger or disdain, as though
   David had cherished an unworthy desire. He honored His servant even in
   the non-acceptance of his offer and multiplied as many blessings upon
   the head of the king as could have descended upon it if he had been
   permitted to carry out his intention!

   Now, in imitation of David, let us think of some grand thing that we
   can do for the Lord our God. Let us, with consecrated spirit and with
   liberal hand, seek to honor and glorify the Lord our Redeemer! But if
   we should not be permitted to do that particular work upon which we
   have set our heart, let us not be surprised or disappointed. A
   servant's true obedience can sometimes be as well seen in what he does
   notdo, as in what he does. It is not for us to choose our place, or our
   work and, though the zealous servant may prefer to do something which
   shall show his loyalty to his master in the clearest light, yet is that
   loyalty even more fully seen when his master says, "No, I wish you not
   to do that." And he, without a murmur, sits down, or goes to work
   somewhere else where he may have been bid to go. It is right for you to
   have in your heart a project for God's Glory--it is well that it is in
   your heart--but if your pet project may not be carried out, it is your
   duty and privilege to then say to your Lord, "I am Your servant in the
   doing or in the not doing. I am absolutely at Your disposal in this
   matter and, by Your Grace, in all other things, too--and so I wish it
   always to be."

   Nathan was sent to David to reveal to him God's great purposes of Grace
   towards him and his son Solomon, and the whole of his dynasty, and to
   give the promise that one descended from him should sit upon the throne
   forever--as He does and will--for the King of kings and Lord of lords,
   whom we greet with cries of, "Hosanna!" is the Son of David. And He
   still reigns and He shall reign till all His foes shall be trodden
   beneath His feet. And then He shall reign forever and ever, hallelujah!
   As this Revelation was given to David, he seems to have been oppressed
   with the weight of mercy which God had put upon him, so he went in and
   sat before the Lord to meditate upon what Nathan had said. I think
   there were two questions that arose in his mind--and to these questions
   he tried to find an answer. The first was--Why should God speak such
   "exceedingly great and precious promises" concerning such weighty
   matters, such everlasting blessings? That was his first question. And
   the other was--Why should these great promises be spoken to him? Why to
   him rather than to anyone else? "Who am I, O Lord God! And what is my
   house, that You have brought me this far?" "Is this the manner of man,
   O Lord God?" He then proceeded to give an answer to his two questions
   in the words of our text, "According to Your own heart, have You done
   all these great things."

   So, from his answer we learn, first, that the measure of God's goodness
   is the heart ofGodand, secondly, the reason of this goodness lies in
   the heart of God.

   I. First, THE MEASURE OF DIVINE GOODNESS IS THE HEART OF GOD.

   God did great things for David, but not because of David's own
   greatness. "I took you," said the Lord to him, "from the sheepcote,
   from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel." He
   was at first nothing but a shepherd boy, so God did not choose him
   because of his greatness. And when the Lord gave these great promises
   to David, it was not because of the greatness of David's design of
   building the Temple, for God seemed to think but little of that and
   said, "In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
   Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I
   commanded to feed My people Israel, saying, Why have you not built Me
   an house of cedar?" No, the one reason for the great blessings and
   promises which God gave to David was found in the heart of God! If a
   king gives presents to his courtiers, why does he make them so precious
   and costly! Not because of the extraordinary deserts of the person upon
   whom he bestows them, but because he is, himself, a king and,
   therefore, his gifts must correspond with his high position. A man of
   liberal spirit gives generously, where a churl would scarcely spare the
   smallest bronze coin. But why does the generous one give so freely!
   Why, simply because he is generous! Men do not always measure their
   gifts by the worth of those to whom they give them, but if they are,
   themselves, large-hearted, they reckon according to the largeness of
   their own hearts and give accordingly. That is what David said--he
   could not imagine why God should do such great things for him till this
   thought entered his mind, "He is a great God. Greatly gracious and full
   of loving kindness and therefore it is that He has promised all these
   things to me."

   If you look carefully, you will see that this general principle runs
   through all the gifts of God to us. But, dear Hearers, God gave us one
   such costly gift that He could never give us another equal to it! I
   mean, the great gift of the Lord Jesus Christ. God had but one
   only-begotten and well-beloved Son, yet He gave Him to us! Now, if all
   Heaven and earth were put together, and all that God has anywhere in
   the universe were added thereto, it could not equal in value that first
   majestic and unspeakable Gift! How came the great Jehovah ever to think
   of making such a wondrous Present as this to poor worms such as men
   are? No one could have suggested the thought to Him! I can well believe
   that when the holy angels heard that the Son of God was to be
   Incarnate, and when it oozed out that in human flesh He was to die,
   even they could scarcely believe that such a thing was possible! The
   thought of Calvary's Sacrifice could never by any possibility have
   originated in their mind! O God, You did give Your Son to us, and for
   us, because Your heart was Your heart and there is nothing like it even
   in Your Heaven of Glory! His infinite heart, in inconceivable
   compassion, suggested to itself the giving up of its greatest Treasure
   and it gave up for us, poor sinful men, the very heart of Christ to
   bleed and die on our behalf! It must be because of the love of the
   heart of God that this unique Gift was given--there could be no other
   reason for its bestowal.

   Then, dear Friends, following the course of the chapter as well as we
   can, the next promise was concerning the great adoption. God said to
   David, concerning Solomon, "I will be his Father, and he shall be My
   son"--and the great honor which was promised to Solomon has been also
   conferred upon every Believer in Jesus, for, "as many as received Him,
   to them gave He power (the right, or privilege) to become the sons of
   God, even to them that believe on His name." Have not many of us
   received within our hearts "the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
   Abba, Father"? Now, what could have induced God to adopt usas His sons
   and daughters? What could have made Him say to us, "I will receive you,
   and will be a Father unto you," except this reason which David gives in
   the words of our text, "According to Your own heart, have You done all
   these great things"? The fatherly heart of God longed to take within
   itself vast multitudes of the human race, so He said, "My Son shall be
   the first-born among many brethren. He is my only-begotten Son, but
   there shall be given to Him a numerous seed who shall be joint-heirs
   with Him, for they shall be adopted into My family." And it is even so.
   God did not adopt us because of any merit in us which entitled us to be
   His children--but because He has such a great heart, so full of
   love--when He made a feast for His Son, He could not endure that there
   should be any empty seats at that royal banquet, so He said to His
   servants, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come
   in, that My house may be filled!" Thus you and I, Beloved, were brought
   in and made to sit there with Christ Jesus, as we do sit even now, for
   He is not ashamed to call us brethren. This greatness of the heart of
   God must have been the cause and the onlycause of our adoption, as well
   as of our redemption!

   The Lord also promised to David that when He had adopted Solomon as His
   son, He would be constant to him, and never forsake him--"If he commits
   iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
   of the children of men: but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I
   took it from Saul." Brothers and Sisters, that great constancy of
   lovefinds a parallel in your case and mine! God does not adopt us as
   His children, today, and then cast us off tomorrow. I speak with all
   reverence when I say that it is not possible for Him who, "according to
   His abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead," to unchild us and permit
   us to lose that hope! My sons, whatever they may be, must always be my
   sons. And they who are born of God shall forever be the children of
   God. I venture to repeat the lines that have often been spoken against,
   but which are true every whit--

   "Once in Him, in Him forever! Nothing from His love can sever!" He
   gives us eternal life and we shall never perish, neither shall any
   pluck us out of His hands.

   And why is this? Because of some good thing in us that will make us
   constant and keep us holding fast to Him? No! Here is the answer, let
   me read the text again--"According to Your own heart, have You done all
   these great things." God's heart is constant in its affection. He does
   not cast away His children. He will not divorce the soul that has been
   espoused unto Him. Christ has made us members of His body, of His
   flesh, and of His bones--we can neverbe cut off from Him--no, not even
   a little finger of Christ shall ever be taken away, else would He be a
   mutilated Savior and that He can never be! His own declaration is, "All
   that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out." He will securely and forever keep all the
   sheep that were given to Him by His Father! Not one of them will be
   lost.

   This has always seemed to me to be one of the supreme blessings of the
   Covenant of Grace. I confess that I would hardly give a penny for any
   salvation that I could lose. I would not go across the street to pick
   up a sort of quarterly or yearly salvation! Everlasting life is the
   thing we need--the life of God which can never change or be taken from
   us--and that is what is given to all of you who believe in Christ
   Jesus! But why is it given? The only answer is--According to the
   heart--the faithful, immutable, gracious, loving heart--of the
   ever-blessed Father. Even under the old dispensation, God said, "I am
   the Lord, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed."
   "The Lord, the God of Israel, says that He hates putting away." He
   cannot endure it and, therefore, He will not put away those who are
   espoused to

   Him!

   Let me mention another great favor which we get from God, and that is,
   the promise of blessing for the future. The Lord spoke concerning
   Solomon and David's house, "for a great while to come," and He has
   spoken after the same fashion concerning us who believe in Jesus. Paul
   asked, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" And then
   answered his own question, "I am persuaded that neither death, nor
   life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
   nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall
   be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
   our Lord." Unless Christ shall come first, we shall all die--but death
   will not divide us from the living Savior! It will only knock off the
   fetters from this decaying body and give us liberty to soar away to the
   bosom of our Lord! You and I, if we are believers in Him, shall be
   there with Him. If we are among the called, and chosen, and faithful,
   we shall, by-and-by, stand at His right hand and we shall reign with
   Him, in His Glory, forever and ever, in yonder land of blessedness--in
   the Kingdom of the Father! "You have spoken also of Your servant's
   house for a great while to come," said David. But, in our case, it is
   far more than a great time to come, for it is a great eternityto come!
   God has appointed bliss for us forever and forever--"pleasures
   forevermore." "A crown of glory that fades not away." "A city which has
   foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God." "A kingdom which cannot
   be moved."

   That last passage suggests one thing more which I find in this chapter.
   That is, the promise of the kingdom. The Lord said, concerning David's
   son, "I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name,
   and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever." And here is
   the parallel in our case, for we are made kings and priests unto our
   God and we shall reign forever and ever! To us, also, belong our Lord's
   words to His disciples, "I appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father has
   appointed unto Me." "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's
   good pleasure to give you the kingdom." You shall even judge angels and
   sit as co-assessors with the great Judge in that Last Tremendous Day!
   And concerning the mighty fallen angel, himself, to you shall be
   fulfilled the promise, "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your
   feet shortly." Oh, the glory of which He has spoken concerning us and
   the kingdom that is yet to be revealed!

   Now, why does the Lord lavish such marvelous mercy upon such
   insignificant and undeserving creatures as we are? Why does He seem to
   use His utmost powers in inventing new blessings for us, such as must
   astonish the angels that stand before His face? Oh, why does He thus
   lift the beggars from the dunghill and set them among princes, even the
   princes of His people! Our text contains the only answer--"According to
   Your own heart, have You done all these great things." What an
   immeasurable measure of goodness and Grace there is in the heart of
   God!

   Before I leave this part of my subject, I want you to turn it to
   practical account. Try, dear Friends, to use this thought whenever you
   are exercising faith. The devil will say to you about many a promise
   which God has given, "Oh, that is too good to be true!" Tell him that
   it is not so--it might seem too good if God gave only according to the
   measure of our merit, or the limit of our understanding, or the extent
   of our faith. But He does much better than that-- "exceeding abundantly
   above all that we ask or think." God'sheart, not mine, is the measure
   of His giving! Not my capacity to receive, but His capacity to give!
   Get that thought thoroughly fixed in your mind. I can only receive like
   a man, but God can give like a God! He does everything Divinely and He
   certainly makes no exception to His rule when He is dealing with His
   people. If it is God who is to give, then I can believe in the
   greatness of the gift, be it what it may, for nothing can be too great
   for Him!

   You know the old and somewhat hackneyed story about Alexander promising
   to a man in his army that he would give him whatever he chose to ask.
   He was to send his request to the imperial treasurer, but, when it was
   written out, it was for so huge a sum that the treasurer refused to pay
   it. It was too much, he said, for a common soldier to receive. But when
   Alexander heard of it, he said, "I like that man's faith--he has
   honored me by such a large demand, for he asks something that it is
   worthy of Alexander to give." Now, if that man had been foolish enough
   to measure his request by his own poor rank, he would have asked for a
   few pounds in ready cash, or a pension of a few pence a day might have
   contented him. But, instead of doing so, he reckoned according to the
   vastness of Alexander's empire and asked great things, and so he did
   Alexander honor! Whenever you are exercising faith, Beloved, remember
   that it is according to the heart of God to give with exceeding
   generosity.

   So, when you are praying, if unbelief would stop you, and say, "Do not
   ask for this or that, for it is too much for you to have," I advise you
   to say to yourself, "I will not be stinted in my desire and I will not
   commit the sin of limiting the Holy One of Israel. But, as He gives
   according to His own heart, I will ask great things of Him, for He has
   said, 'Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.'" You know, I suppose
   what some people say is the meaning of that passage. I am not quite
   sure that it is so, but it is said that, sometimes, the kings of Persia
   have been known to bid a prince open his mouth and they have put in
   diamonds, pearls, rubies, emeralds, and all manner of precious things,
   as many as it would hold. If that kind of thing should happen to any of
   you, I expect that you would open your mouths very wide--I have no
   doubt that your capacity to receive would be greater, on that occasion,
   than you have ever yet known it to be! But when you are coming before
   the God of the whole earth, oh, for a big mouth to ask great things of
   Him! Oh, for a wide mouth, then, to take in every conceivable blessing
   from Him! In our prayers, let us not ask according to the measure of
   our poor little heart that is so shriveled, cold and weak, but
   according to God's great heart that is infinite and full of Grace and
   love!

   Just once more, use this thought of the greatness of God's heart in the
   exercise of your delight in the Lord. Sometimes we are afraid of being
   too happy, but that is scarcely possible. Oh, how happy Christians have
   a right to be, with Heaven for their home, God for their Father, Christ
   for their Savior, the Holy Spirit for their Comforter and the Sacred
   Trinity pledged to defend and bless them! Oh, sit down and delight
   yourselves in the Lord! Let me not hear anything about cares and
   troubles for a while--I need to get into my secret place of communion
   with my God, shut the door and just turn over and over in my mind such
   a passage as this, "They shall be My people, and I will be their God."
   Or this, "Fear you not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am
   your God: I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will
   uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness." David wrote,
   "Delight yourself also in the Lord," not merely be thankful, or
   peaceful, or happy, but, "delightyourself in the Lord." Do not go
   paddling about in the shallows--take a header and dive into the depths
   of Divine joy! Plunge yourself into the Godhead's deepest sea and be
   lost in His immensity! You shall never so fully and so truly find
   yourself as when you have lost yourself in God! "Oh, that is saying too
   much!" says someone. No, it is not--it may be too much for you if you
   are measuring with your poor little bushel--but now take God's great
   measure as it is revealed to us in our text--"According to Your own
   heart, have You done all these great things, to make Your servant know
   them." The next time I find a little mercy, I will say, "Thank God for
   that," but I shall not be quite sure whether it is not one of the
   common, ordinary mercies that He gives, alike, to His friends and His
   foes. But when I get hold of a great mercy that is so enormous that I
   cannot comprehend it, I shall say of it, "That came from God! I am sure
   it did. Great mercies come from the great God, the great Giver of all
   good things." The greatness of the mercy is the proof that it is
   Divine--and my soul will appropriate it, and rejoice in it, for God has
   given it to me according to His own heart!

   I have only a few minutes left for the second part of my subject, which
   happens to be a Truth of God which I have so often preached to you,
   that I may the less regret that I have but a short time to speak upon
   it now.

   II. Secondly, THE REASON OF GOD'S GOODNESS TO US LIES IN HIS OWN HEART.

   Why does God bless His people? What is the cause of it? Here it is in
   the text--"According to Your own heart, have You done all these great
   things." Why did God have mercy at all on any sinner? Because mercy was
   in His heart and "He delights in mercy." When God was willing to pardon
   sin, why did He not save the fallen angels? Why did He pass by them and
   look in pity on men? For no reason that I know of, but that it was
   according to His own heart. And when He did turn to men to save them,
   why did He take pity on you, and why did He look with love on me? I
   cannot tell you, except for the reason which our Lord Jesus, Himself,
   gave, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight." When God
   elected His people, why did He elect themP. Here is the
   reply--"According to Your own heart, have You done all these great
   things." Sovereignty ruled the hour! God chose whom He had a right to
   choose, for this is one of the attributes which He strictly guards--"I
   will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
   on whom I will have compassion." Some people bite their tongues
   whenever they hear me quote that text. Well, they will have to bite
   them very often, for it is one of the most grand Truths of God revealed
   in the Scriptures and I shall delight to repeat it as long as I live!
   And to any objector, I have simply to say what Paul wrote, "No but, O
   man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say
   to Him that formed it, Why have you made me thus? Has not the potter
   power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor,
   and another unto dishonor?" It is God's will that chooses His people
   unto eternal life. We know no other reason.

   Will you, who are redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, tell me
   why you were thus favored? Why were you given to Christ and put into
   His Church? Yes, why, but that it was according to the heart of God?
   And when you were called effectually by His Grace and made willing in
   the day of His power, while so many others refused to come, and
   willfully perished, what was the reason for the distinction in your
   case? Some good thing in you? Far from it! Our text explains the
   mystery--"According to Your own heart, have You done all these great
   things." And when you were pardoned, Brother, why were you forgiven?
   For the sake of your repentance, or in hope of your doing better in the
   future? By no means, for, if you did better, it would be the resultof
   the pardon, not the causeof it! The only satisfactory explanation is
   that it was according to God's own heart! Is not that a grand passage,
   in the 43rd of Isaiah, (oh, how often I have admired God's Grace as
   revealed in it), where God speaks of His people having wearied Him with
   their iniquities? He says that He never wearied them, nor caused them
   to serve with an offering, yet they had not bought Him any sweet cane
   with money, nor filled Him with the fat of their sacrifices. But they
   made Him to serve with their sins, and wearied Him with their
   iniquities. Yet, even then, He goes on to say, "I, even I, am He that
   blots out your transgressions"--for what reason? "For My own
   sake"--not, "for your sakes," but, "for My own sake"--"and will not
   remember your sins."

   The reason for God's mercy lies not in man, but in God's own heart! He
   looked and He could see no good of any kind in man, nor the slightest
   hope of there ever being any good. But within His own bosom He found
   the motive for the display of His Grace--and then His own arm brought
   salvation! Oh, how blessed it is to see this great Truth of God--that
   the cause of the salvation of any man lies in God's own heart, not in
   the man's own goodness or worthiness, or in any works foreseen in
   him--or in anything at all that comes of the creature!

   Now, I want you who are coming to God for mercy to see how you can make
   use of this Truth. I know what you have been doing. You have been
   looking inside yourheart to find a reason why God should forgive you
   and, as you cannot find any reason there, you think that there is none.
   Now just turn your eyes the other way and look up to the great heart of
   God, and say, with David, "Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your
   loving kindness according to the multitude of Your tender mercies blot
   out my transgressions." Try to spy out the reason for mercy in
   God--there is not any reason for it in yourself. You deserve His
   fiercest wrath and hottest Hell! And if that is your portion, you will
   never be able to complain of any injustice having been done to you, for
   you will have no more punishment than your sins have brought upon you!
   But look away to God's heart and you will see that He loves to
   forgive--that it is His Glory to forgive! So plead with Him to pardon
   you for His own name's sake, for that is the best of all arguments.

   I want you not only to do that, when you first come to Him, but to do
   the same as you continue to cling to Him. I can assure you that I am
   clinging to Christ, at this moment, in exactly the same way as I did
   when I first found Him. I got rid of everything that I could confide
   in. In fact, I would have had to laugh at myself if I had set up any
   righteousness of my own, for I had not a stick or stone out of which I
   could have made a righteousness fit to present to God! Then I came to
   Christ, not because I had any right of my own to cling to, but because
   He seemed a dear, kind Savior who loved me to cling to Him! And that is
   just why I am still clinging to Him. I say to Him, "Lord, I will not go
   away from You, for as I look up to You, I perceive that You are all
   goodness, and all mercy, and all love. And therefore, by Your Grace, I
   intend to cling to You as long as I live. Sink or swim, I will always
   hold to You." In like manner, dear Friend, your reason for continuing
   to cling to Christ must be found only in the heart of Christ and not in
   yourself. Cling on, then, because it is according to His heart never to
   cast away a single soul that puts its trust in Him!

   And this is the reason, dear Brothers and Sisters, why we must cast all
   our care upon Him. I invite you, and I urge you to do so. If you ask
   yourself, "Why should I cast my care on Him?" The reply is, because it
   is His heart's wish that you should do so. Christ loves you to leave
   your cares with Him. The more you trust Him, the better He loves you,
   if that can be. At least, the more you shall realize His love. You know
   the pretty story of the poor girl in India whose teacher was very sick
   and weak, so the girl begged her teacher to lean upon her. But the
   English lady did not like to lean too heavily, so the girl pleaded, "O
   dear Teacher, if you love me, lean hard! I shall be happy to feel your
   weight upon me." And it is just so with the Lord Jesus! He loves you to
   lean hard upon Him, to cast yourself wholly upon Him and give up trying
   to help yourself! You will never be so blessed and never realize so
   much of the preciousness of Christ as when you do that! Perhaps you
   ask, "May I?" May you?! He wants you to do so and that is the very
   reason why you may! According to His own heart, He bids you come and
   cast yourself entirely upon Him!

   Now, dear Hearers, what do you say to this subject? Does it not glorify
   God? Have I preached up man? No, I have preached him downand I have
   tried to preach God up to the very highest--and so I will while this
   tongue can move! Let my right hand forget her cunning before I shall
   begin to preach about the dignity of human nature and the grandeur of
   the miserable wretch called man! No, God is glorious over all and if
   man is plucked from the burning, it must be the hand of God that
   delivers him--and the reason why he is rescued is because the heart of
   God has moved His hand to save the poor sinner from going down to
   destruction! I am quite content with the poet's reason--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem, Or give the Creator
   delight? 'Twas even so, Father,'you always must sing, 'Because it
   seemedgood in Your sight.'"

   But, O Beloved, what a wide door this Truth of God sets open for poor
   lost men! You self-righteous people will not come in by it, for you do
   not like this God-made entrance. You want to try to save
   yourselves--but you will only the more effectually ruin
   yourselves--that is all that will come of it! But every poor sinner who
   is worried by the devil and brought to the lowest extremity, will say,
   "If there is a reason in the heart of God why I should be saved, I will
   come and trust myself on Christ's finished work and, trusting in Him, I
   will see whether I shall not be saved." O you lost and ruined! O you
   helpless and hopeless! O you far-off ones! O you who lie at death's
   door and Hell's door--look to Jesus on the Cross! Your hope lies there!
   Turn your eyes away from yourself, for there is nothing in yourself but
   that which you will have to weep over and groan over! Man's extremity
   is God's opportunity--if you have come to the end of self, I invite you
   to begin with Christ! Yes, if you have done with self, Christ has
   already begun with you! And when He begins, He never ceases till He
   perfects His work! The Lord bless and save you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 SAMUEL 7:1-22.

   Verses 1, 2. And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and
   the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; that the
   king said unto Nathan the Prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of
   cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains. He said no more, but
   his intention was very plain, namely, to build a house that should be a
   more suitable abode for the Ark of the Lord.

   3. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for
   the LORD is with you. He spoke too fast. Even Prophets, who are
   Inspired of God, must wait upon their Master for their message! And
   when they utter words which only come out of their own mouths, they say
   what they will have to unsay before long. It did look very clear that
   this was the proper thing for Nathan to say to David, but he had not a,
   "Thus says the Lord," for it.

   4. 5. Andit came topass that night, that the Word ofthe LORD came unto
   Nathan, saying, Go and tell My servant David, Thus says the LORD. "You
   have already let him know what Nathanhad to say about the matter. Now
   go and tell him what Jehovah says."

   5. Shall you build Me an house for Me to dwell in?The conception was
   altogether too low. He has made all space-- time is His creation and
   the arch of Heaven stands by His almighty power--shall God, Himself,
   have a housein which He can dwell?

   6. Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought
   up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have
   walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. A structure to be set up, and
   taken down, and to be moved about wherever the people journeyed. That
   was sufficient to be a central shrine of worship, and God cared for
   nothing else.

   7. In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
   Israel, spoke I a word with any ofthe tribes of Israel, whom I
   commanded to feed My people Israel, saying, Why build you not Me an
   house of cedar?Did God ever put to the children of Israel such a
   question as this? No, and it is very remarkable that, from the time
   that the Temple was built, you may date the decay of true religion in
   Israel! And the same thing has happened many times since--whenever
   religion is surrounded by elaborate ceremonies and gorgeous
   architecture, it is almost certain to suffer loss of power and
   efficacy. The simplicity of worship may not be the life of it, but it
   has a very intimate connection with that life.

   8-11. Now therefore so shall you say unto My servant David, Thus says
   the LORD of Hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the
   sheep, to be ruler over Mypeople, over Israel: andI was with you
   wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies, out of your
   sight, and have made you a great name, like unto the name ofthe great
   men that are in the earth. Moreover I will appoint a place for Mypeople
   Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their
   own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
   them any more, as beforetime, and as since the time that I commanded
   judges to be over Mypeople Israel, and have caused you to rest from all
   your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that He will make you an house.
   God has a way of returning men's generosity in kind. Since David wished
   to build God's house, God would build David's house!

   12-15. And when your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your
   fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of
   your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house
   for My name, andI will establish the throne of his kingdom forever I
   will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I
   will chasten him with the rod ofmen, and with the stripes ofthe
   children of men: but My mercy shallnot depart away from him, as I took
   it from Saul, whom Iput away before you. Here is our warrant for
   believing in the final salvation of Solomon! Perhaps that Book of
   Ecclesiastes, the work of his old age, shows us by what rough and
   thorny ways God brought the wanderer back. He had tried to satisfy
   himself with the things of time and sense, but he was constrained, at
   last, to utter this verdict, "Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher;
   all is vanity." And He had to go back to His God, and find his comfort
   there.

   16-18. And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever
   before you: your throne shall be established forever. According to all
   these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto
   David. Than went king David in and sat before the LORD. Like one
   weighted down with a great load of mercy, too heavy for him to stand up
   under it and, therefore, he must sit down and consider and meditate
   upon the wonderful words of God to him!

   18, 19. And he said, Who am I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that
   You have brought me to this point? And this was yet a small thing in
   Your sight, O Lord GOD; but You have spoken also of Your servant's
   house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O LORD
   GOD?1 'All that You have done for me, therefore, in overcoming my
   enemies, and making me king over this people, has seemed to be but a
   small thing to You, for, 'You have spoken also of Your servant's house
   for a great while to come.'" That astonished David and, therefore, he
   asked, "Is this the manner of man, O Lord God?" "Man gives after his
   own grudging fashion, but You give in a lordly, kingly, Divine way."
   David's question may be rendered, "Is this the law of the Man? Am I to
   be the parent of that Man who shall be my Lord as well as my son, who
   shall reign forever and ever, and of whose Kingdom there shall be no
   end?" David was spelling out the inner mystery hidden in the words of
   the Lord, reading between the lines and discovering that the Covenant
   which God had made with him was, at least in some respects, a
   repetition of that greater Covenant made with Christ on his behalf.

   20. And what can David say more unto You? He had not said much, but he
   could not say much under such circumstances. He was utterly
   overwhelmed, just as when some wondrous kindness has been shown to us,
   we wish rather to sit still, in grateful silence, than to stand up and
   speak acknowledgments, for our heart is too full for utterance!

   20-22. For You, LORD GOD, know Your servant For Your word's sake, and
   according to Your own heart, have You done all these great things, to
   make Your servant know them. Therefore You are great, O LORD GOD: for
   there is none like You, neither is there any God beside You, according
   to all that we have heard with our ears. God had said to David, in the
   message He sent by Nathan, "I have made you a great name, like unto the
   name of the great that are in the earth." And now David brings back the
   words to God, and says, "You are great, O LORD GOD: for there is none
   like You, neither is there any God beside You."

The Flight to Zoar

   (No. 2642)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 1, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING, IN THE
   AUTUMN OF 1857.

   "The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar." Genesis
   19:23.

   THE destruction of Sodom was, undoubtedly, a literal fact. And the
   record of it in Genesis is as true a piece of history as any event that
   is recorded by Tacitus or Josephus. But it was also intended to be a
   great parabolic lesson to us--a lesson in the shape of a parable--by
   which we might receive both instruction and blessing. The Old Testament
   is a great Book of texts and the New Testament contains the sermons
   upon them. Lot's wife was in the Old Testament as a text and in the New
   Testament we have the sermon upon it, "Remember Lot's wife." And
   wherever, my Brothers and Sisters, I find our Lord Jesus Christ, or any
   of His Apostles referring to an incident in the Old Testament, I always
   think it is our business to look at that event to which they refer. In
   the writings of the old Puritans, which I delight to read, I often find
   in the margin a hand pointing to some special words which it is
   requisite that the reader should particularly note and read with care.
   And when I see the hand put opposite the passage, by some old lover of
   the Truth of God, who, in days of yore, read the book, I generally turn
   to it with eagerness, to see what is the gem pointed at by the finger.

   Now, I think, when our Savior said, "Remember Lot's wife," He did, as
   it were, put a hand on the margin of the Bible, pointing to the whole
   incident describing the destruction of Sodom. He did, in effect, say,
   "Mark that event. Look at it closely, for there is more in it than
   there seems to be." And as there is something instructive in Lot's wife
   becoming a pillar of salt, there is something to be learned from every
   step of Lot's journey--and from every incident connected with it. If it
   is so, I shall not be regarded as being whimsical and fanciful if I
   assert that, in this text, I believe there is much instruction in the
   simple incident recorded here--"The sun was risen upon the earth when
   Lot entered into Zoar."

   I will soon map out my sermon. Lot was nearly in the dark till he
   reached Zoar--that is the first head. Secondly, the sun was risen upon
   the earth as soon as Lot was in Zoar. Thirdly, the same moment which
   saw the sun rise on Lot saw the fiery hail fall on Sodom. We have here
   three facts which I think are three pictures illustrating three great
   Truths of God with regard to the sinner's experience.

   I. First, then, LOT WAS NEARLY IN THE DARK ON THE ROAD HE RAN TILL HE
   REACHED ZOAR.

   Mark, when he first started, the Scripture tells us, in the 15th verse,
   that the morning rose--there was the first gray dawn when the angels
   hurried him out of Sodom! it was just the breaking of the day and it is
   said that as soon as Lot entered into Zoar, the sun was thoroughly
   risen, but not till then. He had to find his way through shadows and
   run, to a great degree, in the dark.

   Ah, my Friends, that was a solemn moment when those notable guests
   turned their host out of doors and did it all out of love and kindness,
   too! When the two angels took Lot, his wife and his daughters by the
   hand and dragged them forth, and bade them run, it was a solemn moment.
   The heavens were heavy with God's wrath and only waited until Lot was
   safely housed to burst in impetuous torrents upon the devoted cities.
   Do you not see them, or, rather, do you not fancy you can see their
   black figures in the gloom of the twilight? You scarcely understand
   what it can be--there are two men pushing forth a family into the
   street. You see them next grasping their hands and with loving haste
   driving them forward. You now hear a voice, something more than
   earthly, speaking in the celestial language, crying, "Escape for your
   life!" And now mark the man, his wife and his daughters
   fleeing--fleeing from their own house--fleeing from their own kinsmen
   and acquaintances! A woman leaving her own sons-in-law and wives
   leaving their own husbands to perish in the city! Watch their flight!
   See them as they flee across the plain--they often stumble, for the way
   is not clear before them--and they little know where they are going.
   They only see the dark shadow of the mountain looming in the distance
   and they run there, in the darkness, with all their might.

   Now, Lot running in the dark is the picture of a poor sinner when he
   comes out of Sodom. You who have just been awakened and convinced of
   sin, must not expect that you will have the sunlight of God's favor all
   at once. There must first come into your house the angel of conviction
   to thrust you out of your abode of ruin. After you have run a while,
   you will then have sunlight, joy and peace. But in your running, while
   you are seeking the Savior, you must expect to run in the darkness--and
   if you do expect it, you will not be disappointed. Oh how dark it is to
   a poor sinner when he is first brought to know his state by nature,
   before the blessed remedy of Grace has been applied to him by the Holy
   Spirit! Look at him--tears follow each other down his cheeks in one
   perpetual race! He weeps almost all day and all night. And if he rests
   for a while for very sorrow, his dreams disturb him--he is always
   miserable--men call him mad, for he is as one demented. He talks to
   himself in doleful language and, as he goes about his business, he
   moans and sighs, "Oh, that!" And, "Ah!" And, "Would that!"
   Monosyllables that no man understands, but which are well known in
   their inward meaning both to God and to his own heart! He has no ray of
   hope. He believes he is shut out from God forever and he thinks that
   God is just in having hidden the light of His Countenance from him.

   He does not murmur against the Most High, but never was man so nearto
   complaining as he is. He is ready to lay violent hands on himself, for
   he says he cannot bear his existence. He cries with David, "I am weary
   with my groaning! All night I make my bed swim; I water my couch with
   my tears!" "Day and night Your hand is heavy upon me." He turns to the
   Book of Job and he reads the Patriarch's doleful cries and declares
   that he could say the same. And all the mournful words of David or
   Jeremiah, he applies to himself. "I watch, and am as a sparrow alone
   upon the housetop," he says. "I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I
   am like an owl of the desert. I have no comfort, no peace, no joy.
   God's mercy is clean gone from me forever! He will no longer be mindful
   of me!"

   Now, dear Friends, please remember that, to a greater or lesser degree,
   this always is and always must be the condition of a sinner when he is
   seeking the Savior. O you who are in the dark, remember that you are
   only where thousands of others have been! Think it not a strange thing
   that you are subject to this eclipse--others have been eclipsed,
   too--and all those who have found the Sun of Righteousness have had to
   run through the dark to get to Him! There must be a dark tunnel before
   we can get at Christ and we must grope through worse than an Egyptian
   night before we behold the face of God with joy!

   Perhaps I may be asked what it is that makes it so dark to a poor
   sinner while he is seeking Christ. I think I may tell you, very
   briefly, it is partly his own ignorance. Poor Soul, he does not know
   enough about the Savior, nor enough about the plan of salvation to
   cheer him. Very likely he has never heard the way of salvation preached
   in all his life. That may be true and yet he may have attended a
   chapel--as chapels go in these times--for many a year! He does not
   understand the simple A B C of the Gospel, the sinner's sinnership the
   only argument to prove that he has an interest in Christ's salvation.
   He does not understand the Atonement--he cannot make it out how God can
   be just and yet pardon such a wretch as he is. "All this ignorance
   necessarily causes darkness." And, mark you, that mistakes concerning
   the Gospel are never little things--they are always dangerous, they are
   always painful. Sinners have more griefs than they need have because
   they have less knowledge than they should have.

   Sometimes, too, this darkness arises from mistakes concerning the
   Gospel There is not so much ignorance as there is error with regard to
   it--by which word, I mean, not a mistake willfully committed, but a
   mistake ignorantly committed. I know some people who understand the
   theory of salvation quite well, but they have a mistaken idea as to its
   application, or else, perhaps, they read it the wrong way upwards. I
   know many who do not neglect the Scriptures, but they begin reading
   about election and predestination before they know anything of
   conviction. So, often, the darkness of the sinner arises from
   misapprehension concerning the Gospel.

   Many a time, too, the poor soul is running after Christ in the dark
   because he has got legal ideas in his head. That Mr. Legality is the
   ruin of many and, after all we do and say to him, he still lives on!
   You know how Martin Luther said that he preached Justification by Faith
   every day because he found that the people forgot it every day. In one
   of his quaint sermons, he says, "I feel as if I could take my book and
   beat this doctrine into your heads because you will never remember that
   you are not saved by your own good works, but by the righteousness of
   Christ." A sinner may be told, as plainly as possible, that all he can
   do is less than nothing--that salvation is all of Grace from first to
   last--but that crafty old devil will not let him believe it. He will
   always lead him to think that he must dosomething, or besomething, or
   feelsomething before he can take Jesus Christ to be his All-in-All! And
   so legality, like a black dragon, spreads its wings between the soul
   and God's Light and shuts out every ray of comfort from the poor
   desponding spirit.

   Moreover, this darkness is caused principally by conscience and by
   Satan. It is a strange thing, but, sometimes, a sinner's conscience and
   the devil will strike hands. When Mr. Conscience is blowing his
   dreadful trumpet and startling the sleepy sinner, he is doing good
   service. But, sometimes, after the sinner is thoroughly awakened, the
   devil comes and whispers to Mr. Conscience--and in such a voice that it
   seems as if an angel said it--"Blow on, Mr. Conscience! Blow a still
   more dreadful blast and I will help you." And the devil comes in and,
   with his awful yells, he makes a thousand times worse noise than even
   conscience does--and the poor soul is bewildered, terror-stricken and
   well-nigh driven mad! "Oh," cries Satan, "you have been a sinner beyond
   the reach of Christ's mercy!" "Yes," says conscience, "that you have!"
   "Oh," says the devil, "you have committed every crime that flesh can
   commit." "Yes," says conscience, "that's true!" And he echoes every
   word that Satan says.

   In comes the devil, and says, "You have committed the unpardonable
   sin." "No doubt," says conscience, "I always told you so." "And now,"
   says Satan, "there is no hope for you--you must be cast away forever."
   "Yes," says conscience, "you must be cast away forever! There is no way
   of escape for such a wretch as you are." And when conscience and the
   devil get to blowing the same trumpet, it is a dreadful noise, indeed!
   And there is not a soul in the world that can endure its life when both
   Satan and conscience are making such a furious noise! No wonder, my
   dear Friends, it should be dark with the sinner when he is running on
   the road to Heaven! No wonder that before he finds the Savior, there
   should be a doleful cry in his ears, if Satan and conscience are both
   assailing him! I know that I do not like my conscience to be against
   me, even without the devil. Conscience, when he is noisy, is not a very
   comfortable housemate--certainly, we would rather have him still and
   quiet than always thundering in our ears. But when Hell and conscience
   go together, I say again, there is no soul that can long bear its
   existence, except God, in sovereign mercy, shall either support the
   soul or put a speedy stop to the noise!

   Perhaps you ask me, "Why does not the poor sinner look to Jesus?" Ah,
   that is the very point of his difficulty! He does not look to Jesus
   because he does not think that Jesus Christ died for such a wretch as
   he! You know, it is one thing for you to talk about a sinner looking to
   Jesus when he is in the dark, and quite another thing to do it when you
   are in the dark, yourself. It is a blessed thing when the Lord enables
   a poor sinner to turn his eyes to Calvary and see the brightness of
   Jesus. But there are, often, long days and dreary nights before the
   sinner learns his own sinfulness and is enabled to look to the Savior.
   "But," says one, "why does he not go hear a good minister preach?
   Surely that would help him out of his trouble." My dear Friends, we try
   to preach the Gospel as plainly as we can, but it seems that we only
   rivet the chains on some people.

   There is a poor soul in this place now--I have talked with her many
   times. I know her sad condition and I have often shaped my discourse so
   as to meet her case. Many times I have thought that the Lord has given
   me some sweet word that would break the gates of brass and set the
   imprisoned one at liberty. It has taken a little of the pride out of me
   and shown me how impossible it is for man, when he labors the hardest,
   to bring a soul out of bondage before the Lord's promised hour of
   redemption comes. "But," says one, "why do they not turn to the Bible
   and lay hold on some precious Truth of God! I do so and find comfort
   from it." Yes, my dear Friends, and they do turn to the Bible just as
   you do, yet they find no comfort, for they cannot lay hold on the
   promises. I know when I was, for many a month, in bondage, I used to
   read the Bible through--and the threats were all printed in capitals,
   but the promises were in such small type that, for a long time, I could
   not make them out! And when I did make them out, I did not believe they
   were mine. But the threats were all my own--I was sure of it!

   "There," I said, "when it says, 'He that believes not shall be damned,'
   that means me." When I read, concerning Christ, "He is able also to
   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him," then I thought I
   was shut out. When I read, "He found no place of repentance, though he
   sought it carefully with tears," "Ah," I thought, "that is myself
   again." And when I read, "That which bears thorns and briers is
   rejected and is near to cursing," "Ah," I said, "that describes me to
   the last iota!" And when I heard the Master say, "Cut it down; why
   cumbers it the ground?" "Ah," I thought, "that is mytext--He will have
   me down before very long and not let me cumber the ground any more."
   But when I read, "Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters,"
   I said, "That does not belong to me, I am sure." And when I read, "Come
   unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden," "No," I said, "that
   belongs to my brother, to my sister," or those I knew round about me,
   for they were laboring and heavy laden, I thought, but I was not. And
   though, God knows, I would weep and cry and lament till my heart was
   breaking within me, if any man had asked me whether I sorrowed for sin,
   I would have told him "No, I never had any true sorrow for sin" "Well,
   do you not feel the burden of sin?" "No." "But you really are a
   convinced sinner?" "No," I would have said, "I am not."

   Is it not strange that poor sinners, when they are coming to Christ,
   are so much in the dark that they cannot see their own hands? They are
   so much in the dark that they cannot see themselves! And though God has
   been pleased to work the good work in them and give them godly fear and
   a tender conscience, they will stand up and declare that they have
   neither of those blessings, that in them there is not any good thing
   and that God has not looked on them nor loved them! But, strange as
   this is, that is how souls go to Christ. They are like Lot going to
   Zoar--they are all in the dark and can see nothing until they come to
   the Savior.

   II. Now think of the second fact. NO SOONER WAS LOT IN ZOAR THAN THE
   SUN WAS UP.

   Once he was inside the gate of that little city, the sun shone forth in
   all its brightness! I daresay Lot thought, "Well, I wish it had risen a
   little earlier. Oh, how pleased I would have been if I had had a little
   of that light while running across the plain!" So, when we are brought
   to the Lord Jesus, we often say, "I wish I had had a little of this
   peace when I was in bondage. Oh, if I could have had one cupful of this
   river ofjoy I am now drinking! When I was so thirsty, what a blessing
   it would have been!" But God knows best. Depend upon it, my Brothers
   and Sisters--if one ray of sunlight more had been good for Lot, he
   would have had it! And if, poor tried Sinner, one gleam of comfort more
   than you now have, would be good for you, God would not deny it to you.
   But He keeps you in the dark for your good, as He shall ultimately
   bring you into the light for your good!

   Lot, when he reached Zoar, had the sunlight. And when the sinner gets
   to Christ, then he gets sunlight, too. When the poor soul is widowed of
   all its hopes and bereaved of all its trust. When it is reduced to
   beggary and in a penniless condition. When it has its feet cut from
   under it and its hands shot away. When it has nothing left to call its
   own, but is reduced to death's door. In the hour of its extremity, then
   is God's gracious opportunity! Then, when the spirit casts itself
   wholly, without reserve, upon the blood and righteousness of Jesus and
   puts implicit trust in Him who lived and died to work, and weave, and
   spin, and dye a righteousness for poor sinners--I say, then, for the
   first moment, the sinner gets joy in his heart! Do not expect, my dear
   Hearers, that you will ever get any comfort while you are running
   anywhere except to Christ. Expect the comfort only when you get to Him.
   You may have just a gleam or two of light beforehand, as Lot did, but
   you will not have much more.

   And remember, it is no use your running anywhere except to Christ, for,
   though you run ever so fast, you will only run into deeper darkness
   unless you run to Him--

   "The moment a sinner believes, And trusts in his crucified God, His
   pardon at once he receives, Redemption in full through His blood." That
   very moment his burden rolls off his shoulders, his chains fall to the
   earth and he is free! That moment his sores are all healed, his wounds
   are all bound up and his flowing blood is stanched forever. Have you,
   dear Friend, ever felt that instantaneous change which works such joy
   as this? If you have, then I am not uttering a strange thing when I say
   that the sun has risen upon you! Oh, that moment, when the sinner first
   starts up, clean rid of guilt on his conscience! I thought I could have
   leaped from earth to Heaven, at one spring, when I first saw my sins
   drowned in the Redeemer's blood! You know what John Bunyan says--to
   repeat an often-quoted tale--"I wanted," said he, "to even tell the
   crows on the plowed land what God had done for my soul!"

   Did you ever follow a poor simple convert as soon as he knows the Lord?
   He runs home and calls his neighbors together and says, "I have found
   the Lord Jesus." Probably they will begin laughing at him, but he
   cannot understand what there is to laugh at, for he says, "My Master is
   a precious and blessed Master--He has taken all my sins away!" And he
   will go on telling the simple story till, perhaps, some of them are
   melted by it, though the rest may scoff. The joy, the gladness, the
   rhapsody, the exultation, the young Heaven begun in the heart of the
   newborn convert is the nearest thing to Paradise that the earth ever
   saw! On the day that our sins are pardoned, God sets all the bells of
   Heaven ringing--and then the bells of our heart chime in melody! On the
   day when God is pleased to blot out our sins, He hangs every lane and
   every alley of Mansoul with splendid flags and colors, gilded lamps and
   bright jewels! Then He bids sweet music play in every part of the city
   and He makes the fountains run with wine--and He gives hogsheads of the
   precious liquid for poor souls to drink--souls that have been faint and
   dying and thirsty! Oh, that marriage day, when the soul is advanced to
   Christ! That day, when, for the first time, it rides in the chariot of
   Mercy and sits in the same seat with its Well-Beloved! Oh, that first
   hour, when Jesus puts the ring of His eternal love on the finger of our
   experience and whispers, "You are Mine," and our heart says to Jesus,
   "I am Yours."

   Oh, that moment! Surely, Heaven itself is not happier! All the
   difference between that moment and Heaven is that Heaven is a great
   piece of tapestry and this is one of the threads. "The sun was risen
   upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar," so the Light of God's
   Countenance rises upon poor sinners when they come to Jesus!

   III. Now, thirdly, we have to consider a sadder fact. GOD CAN DO TWO
   THINGS AT A TIME.

   With His right hand, He wheeled the sun up the steeps of Heaven and
   bade it shine upon Lot. And with the other He opened the batteries of
   Heaven that they might rain their fire and brimstone upon Sodom. Let us
   remember that God's two hands are always at work in that way--from the
   very beginning, that is always what He has done. With one hand, He shut
   Noah in the ark and with the other He sent forth the floods of the
   everlasting cisterns and let the fountains of the great deep burst upon
   the earth. With one hand he smote the Red Sea and bade Israel walk
   through it dry-shod and with the other He cast the waters down into
   their place and drowned Pharaoh and all his hosts. And now look at
   Him--with one hand He lights the sun--and with the other hand He
   darkens Sodom with the smoke of the devouring flames! Ah, Friends,
   remember that this is what shall be done all the story through!

   A day is coming when we who, like poor Lot, have been running to Heaven
   in the dark, with many clouds of fear and much gloom and sorrow, will
   reach the river of death! And when the Christian comes to die, God the
   mighty Savior is pleased to take the film from his eyes and enables him
   to see the angels! He opens wide his eye and bids him behold the
   glorious City that is built on high and those shining ones that
   perpetually traverse its streets! He opens his ears and bids him listen
   to the hallelujahs of the blessed and then, sometimes, He catches away
   his spirit and seems to waft it almost over Jordan, till, before the
   man dies, he says, "Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot
   tell, only God knows, but I have been caught up to the third Heaven and
   have seen and heard things which mortals cannot utter." Oh, who can
   describe the raptures of the dying saint, the glories of that moment
   when God is pleased to cut the fetters that bind us to our clay and
   give us leave to soar into His Presence?!

   But while God is doing that with His right hand, what is He doing with
   His left? He is smoothing the path of His children to the grave, but
   what is He doing to the wicked? He is not smoothing their path. "Upon
   the wicked He shall rain snares, fire and brimstone and a horrible
   tempest." When they are dying, He draws no curtains around them, except
   the black curtains of doom! When they are expiring, no angels attend
   their deathbed--but grim fiends are waiting there. The left hand of God
   falls heavily upon the wicked man and as he is entering the world of
   spirits, God sometimes gives him a foretaste and prelude of the horrors
   of Hell. His right hand wheels the sun to give light to the Christian
   and bids him look to Heaven--but His left hand rains down a tempest on
   the wicked and bids him dread to die!

   And now follow the two spirits out of this world. The vital spark of
   the Christian has fled--

   "In vain my fancy tries to paint The moment after death, The glories
   that surround the saint, When yielding up his breath."

   The right hand of God is under the saint and in love He embraces him!
   God upholds His child in the floods. He whispers, "I am with you,
   Israel, passing through the stream; be not afraid, underneath you are
   the everlasting arms." Listen to the shouts of victory! Mark the calm
   composure of the countenance and see the joy flashing in the eyes! This
   is what God's right hand is doing to the righteous. But what is His
   left hand doing to the wicked! My dear Brothers and Sisters, I dare not
   attempt to describe the sinner as he dies! And when he is dead, it were
   too awful for me to suppose how he feels the moment his spirit is out
   of his body. Oh, what an awful sensation that must be when the first
   pang of Hell shoots through the soul! My imagination can just mount to
   it, but I cannot go further. That man was a blasphemer--how must he
   feel when he confronts the God whom he blasphemed and stands before the
   burning eyes of his incensed Creator! Can you imagine that solitary
   moment--for I should suppose there is but one such--although eternity
   is horrible, there can scarcely be more than one moment so new with
   horror, so dolefully novel with torment as when the soul is launched
   upon that everlasting sea, the waves of which are fire, and the depths
   of which are Hell! I cannot tell all that it means. I only know that
   these are the Lord's own words, "Consider this, you that forget God,
   lest I tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver."

   And now comes the Last Great Day! The world is standing before God's
   bar. Look what He is doing with His right hand! He is beckoning the
   righteous to Glory! He is adorning their heads with crowns that excel
   the sun in brightness! He is girding their loins with snow-white robes
   of immaculate purity! He is touching their lips and making them sing
   like cherubim! He is setting their hearts on fire with the bliss of
   Heaven and kindling their spirits with everlasting Glory! He is lifting
   them up and making them sit together with Christ, far above all
   principalities and powers and every name that is named! See how the sun
   is risen upon them! Describe if you can, or imagine if you dare, the
   brightness of the sunlight of Glory when it shall dawn upon redeemed
   man in the day of the final account! Look, it is a sunshine without a
   cloud! It is a sun without an eclipse! Look, see, their happy faces!
   Listen to their joyous songs!--

   "No groans do mingle with the songs That warble from immortal tongues."
   Words fail me to depict the bright sunlight of the Savior's love as it
   shines on every happy saint! Thought cannot let me tell the brightness
   of the Glory that shall stream from the brow of the eternal Father when
   He shall smile upon His well-beloved children! And who can describe the
   Glory of the Sacred Spirit when, in all the riches of His fullness, He
   shall beam in the eye and heart of every blood-bought soul? This is
   what God is doing with His right hand--leading all His saints to Heaven
   and setting them upon thrones forever and ever!

   And what is He doing with His left hand?No, pardon me, excuse me from
   the task of picturing that dread work of Judgment! I might, perhaps,
   say things that would be horrible, terrible and doleful--yet, even
   then, my speech would fall infinitely short of the terrible reality!
   What is God doing to the wicked? He is unloosing the loins of the
   mighty and breaking the iron sinews of their necks! What is God doing
   to the wicked? He is alighting them with terror and driving them mad
   with despair! See them as they fly from His Presence! Listen to them as
   they shriek in their agony! There they go--down, down, down--to the
   gulf of everlasting woe! What is God doing with His left hand? He is
   hurling fire upon them! He is launching thunderbolts! What is He doing?
   O earth, I see you shaking! O stars, I behold you vanishing from the
   vault of night! Sun, you are quenched! Moon, you are a clot of blood! I
   see the heavens stripped of their light and the glorious Son of God
   seated on His snow-white Throne! And I see sinners trembling at their
   everlasting doom! I see them bite their tongues, that, like firebrands,
   scorch their mouths. I see them dying, but not dead! Damned, but not
   annihilated--not ceasing to be--forever bruised beneath the foot of
   vengeance and yet never crushed out of existence! O my God, no mortal
   tongue can tell this dreary tale! Had I been dead and passed the
   burning lake, and smelt the sulfurous flame, then, perhaps, I might
   have spoken of all these terrible realities, but tonight I cannot
   speak! Take your Bibles and read of the fire that cannot be quenched,
   of the worm that dies not, of the Pit that is bottomless--and remember
   that this is what God is doing with His left hand!

   The sun had risen upon Zoar and the fire was falling upon Sodom. Ah,
   Sinner, will it not be an awful thing to see the contrast between you
   and the righteous? If you perish in your ungodly state, it will make
   your Hell more awful when you behold, afar off, the righteous exalted
   in Heaven! Nothing makes the famished man more hungry than to see
   others feasting when he has nothing! O young man, what will it be to
   see your mother there in Heaven and you cast out? O young woman, will
   you see your companion glorified with Jesus and you cast away with
   devils? O husband, will you find yourself crying, with Dives, for a
   drop of water, while your wife is in the Presence of Jesus? Ah, son,
   will you see your parents glorified and you, yourself, cast out? Set
   the two in contrast--look on this picture and on that! God give you
   Grace to bow the knee and "kiss the Son." And if He has taught you your
   need of a Savior, may He give you Grace to accept the hearty invitation
   I would tender you in His name, "Come, and welcome, Sinner, come!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW24:42-51; MATTHEW 25:1-13.

   Matthew 24:42. Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord
   does come. That He will come is certain. That His coming may be at any
   moment is equally sure and, therefore, we ought to always be ready for
   His appearing. The Lord make us to be so!

   43, 44. But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in
   what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not
   have allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore be you also ready,
   for in such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man comes. Perhaps you
   can imagine how eagerly the householder watches when he expects
   thieves. Every little sound alarms him. He thinks he hears someone at
   the door, then he fancies it is someone at the window! But he is on the
   alert, with eyes and ears and his whole being wide awake. So ought we
   to be with regard to the coming of the Lord, as watchful as if we knew
   that Christ would come tonight! We do not know that He will come so
   soon, yet it may be so, "for in such an hour as you think not, the Son
   of Man comes."

   45, 46. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made
   ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is
   that servant, whom his lord, when he comes, shall find so doing. Doing
   whatever the Master has appointed him to do. If he is a minister,
   preaching the Truth of God with all his heart. If he is a teacher,
   endeavoring to feed the minds of the young with sound doctrine.
   Whatever may be his calling, endeavoring to fulfill it to the great
   Taskmaster's satisfaction, as if He should suddenly break in upon the
   work and look at it, then and there, and judge His servant by it. This
   is the way to live!

   47. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
   goods. There are rewards for faithful service-- not of debt, but of
   Grace--not according to the Law, but according to the discipline of the
   House of God. Oh, that we may be such faithful servants that our Lord
   may make us rulers over all that He has!

   48-51. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
   delays his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to
   eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in
   a day when he looks not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of,
   and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the
   hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. He was a
   servant, you see. So this is a warning, not to the outside world, but
   to you who are inside the nominal church and who professto be servants
   of God. And it is especially a warning to those of us who are ministers
   of the Gospel! Oh, that we may never begin to smite our fellow
   servants! Of course, we shall not do it with our fists, but we may do
   it with our tongue. May we never be numbered with those who are living
   for the delights of the flesh! If so, see what must come to us. Our
   Lord still continued to speak upon the same subject of watchfulness by
   delivering the very striking parable of the wise and foolish virgins.

   Matthew 25:1-4. Then shall the kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
   virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
   And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were
   foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took
   oil in their vessels with their lamps. There did not seem to be much
   difference between them. They were all virgins, they all carried lamps,
   their lamps were all lit. And, perhaps, the lamps of the foolish were
   quite as bright as those of the wise. The difference was unobservable
   to most onlookers, but it was an essential and fatal difference.

   Ah, dear Friends, it is the lack of oil that is the ruin of many a
   professor's lamp! Men have a name to live, but they have not the true
   life which is the evidence of the effectual working of the Grace of God
   within their souls. They make a profession of religion, but they have
   not the secret Grace to keep it up. There is a glitter and flash, but
   there is no permanency--and there cannot be any unless the Spirit of
   God is, indeed, in us! We may make a fair show in the flesh for a
   while, but what will be the end of it. This is the all-important
   question--Can we hold on and hold out? Certainly not without that
   heavenly oil which only the Spirit of God can supply!

   5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. Oh, how
   sadly true it is that, sometimes, true saints as well as mere
   professors slumber and sleep! Even those who have the oil of Grace are
   not always wide awake to serve their Master and to proclaim the Gospel
   as they should. There are, alas, sleeping Believers and sleeping
   hypocrites, side by side!

   6, 7. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
   comes; go out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed
   their lamps. They were suddenly awakened, and they leaped to their
   feet--

   "Rising up at the midnight cry, 'Behold the heavenly Bridegroom nigh!'"

   They all trimmed their lamps. That was the first thing for them to
   do--to look to their torches and have them ready. They could not meet
   the Bridegroom in the dark. They must each have a light, so they began
   their lamp-trimming. It is a pity to have to trim your lamp at the
   last. O dear Friends, it is hard work, upon a dying bed, to have to be
   looking to one's lamp! You need your evidences to be bright there--your
   faith to be firm and all your Graces brilliant! There must be no doubts
   and questions there, else they make a dying bed feel hard as granite.
   May we, none of us, have at last to trim our lamps! Those virgins who
   had oil in their vessels were able to trim their lamps and, though the
   work was done hurriedly, it was done, and they were able to take their
   places in the bridal procession.

   8, And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
   lamps are gone out. The modern rendering of this request is, "Send for
   the minister and ask him to pray for us, for our lamps are gone out."
   Take heed, I pray you, you who are bold professors, now--lest you
   should have to say at the last, "Our lamps are gone out." It was too
   late for trimming and lighting then!

   9, 10. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
   for us and you: but go you to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
   And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. There are deathbed
   repentances, undoubtedly, but I fear that, in the great majority of
   cases, people who wake up so late will find that while they go to buy,
   the Bridegroom will come and there will not be, after all, the time in
   which to find the Savior. The mental capacity with which to think of
   Him may fail. The poor head may be so distracted with pain that it may
   not be able to catch the meaning of what faith in Christ is, or how it
   can be exercised. And so, the lamp will have gone out, and it will be
   too late to buy the oil which alone can make it burn. "While they went
   to buy, the bridegroom came."

   10, 11. And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage; and
   the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord,
   Lord, open to us. "Open the door at least to us, for we came to meet
   you, and we carried lamps, and we were with the other virgins. 'Lord,
   Lord, open to us.'" You know, perhaps, those striking lines which
   describe the foolish virgins request and the Bridegroom's response to
   it--

   "'Late, late, so late; and dark the night and chill! Late, late, so
   late; but we may enter still. 'Too late! Too late! You cannot enter
   now.'"

   12. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
   When that door is once shut, it will never again be opened! All
   Scripture goes to prove that. There are some who foolishly dream about
   an opening of that door after death for men who have died
   impenitent--but there is nothingin Scripture to warrant us in having
   any such expectation. The final answer of the Bridegroom to these
   foolish virgins is, "Verily I say unto you, I know you not."

   13. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein
   the Son of Man comes. That is, we do not know when it will be. Some
   have foolishly said, "We do not know the day, or the hour of Christ's
   coming, but we may find out the year." We shall not do anything of the
   kind--the time is hidden altogether! It is not revealed to us and it
   shall not be known till, suddenly, the Lord Himself shall come in the
   clouds, with His bright heavenly retinue, to be glorified in His saints
   and to be admired in all them that believe! Therefore, be always on the
   watch, Beloved, "for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the
   Son of Man comes." God help us to be ready for His appearing at any
   moment, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

The Honored Servant

   (No. 2643)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 8, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   22, 1882.

   "Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that
   waits on his master shall be honored." Proverbs 27:18.

   IN Solomon's day, every man sat under his own vine and fig tree and
   there was peace throughout the whole country. Then, God's Law about
   dividing out the land among the people, so that every man had his own
   plot, was rightly observed and each one had a fig tree of his own, to
   which he gave his personal attention. And, in due time, having waited
   upon the fig tree and kept it, he ate the fruit thereof. Solomon says,
   in another place, "In all labor there is profit," and it is well when
   men feel that it is so, for then they will be inclined to labor. A man
   would not long keep a fruitless fig tree. If he was quite sure that no
   fruit would be the result of his toil, he would leave the tree to
   itself, or else he would say, "Cut it down; why cumbers it the ground?"

   There were some men, in Solomon's day, who, for divers reasons, became
   servants to others--as there still are and always must be--and they
   looked for some return from their service. And the wise man here tells
   them that just as, "Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit
   thereof," so, "he that waits on his master shall be honored." It is a
   commonplace truth that those who are faithful servants ought to be
   honored. I wish, in these times, that matter was more often thought of
   and that men did honor those who are faithful to them. There are some
   people who permit others to minister to their comfort, but it never
   occurs to them to provide for the comfort of their servants. They will
   allow a man to spend most of his life in increasing their business and
   yet, when he is getting old, he is discharged and left to perish by
   starvation so far as they are concerned. I notice this kind of thing
   frequently, with very much regret--and I am not always able to make
   exceptions on behalf of Christian masters, for, sometimes they seem
   only to remember their business and to forget that they are
   Christians--and they act as cruelly as did that Amalekite in David's
   day, who left his servant to die because he was sick. I pray that the
   time may come when there shall be so good an understanding between all
   men that Solomon's words shall be true, "he that waits on his master
   shall be honored."

   I am sorry that they are not always true in that sense, now, but I am
   going to leave that literalmeaning of the words and apply the text to
   those who wait upon the Lord Jesus, having made Him to be their Master,
   for, most certainly, as surely as he who keeps the fig tree shall eat
   the fruit thereof, even much more certainly shall those who wait upon
   our great Master in Heaven find a sweet return from their service, for
   they shall be honored by Him. Very simple will my talk be and you,
   Beloved, who are His servants, do not need anything else, I am sure.

   I. The first observation is that OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST IS OUR MASTER.

   He said to His disciples, after He had washed their feet, "You call Me
   Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am." Is it so with you,
   dear Friends? Let conscience answer the question. Is Jesus Christ
   really Master and Lord to each one of us? It is a wonderful way in
   which He masters us if we are, indeed, His servants. I can never forget
   how, in my own case, it came to pass that I, who had been bought with
   His precious blood and, therefore, belonged to Him, had yet lived
   forgetful of His claims. He passed by and looked on me--and that very
   look made me go out to weep bitterly! But He did more. He laid His hand
   on me--it was a pierced hand and from that day I had a twist in my
   understanding and my judgment! Those who knew me saw that something
   extraordinary had happened to me which had altogether changed me. From
   that time I thought very little of men, and very much of One whom,
   until then, I had despised! Many of my former pursuits ceased to have
   the slightest charm for me and I had, for my one pursuit, the desire to
   do everything to His honor and glory! From that twist I have never been
   able to escape and I have never wanted to do so--from that mystic
   influence which He cast over me, I have never come forth and, what is
   more, I trust I never shall!

   I know that I am describing many of you as well as myself. Oh, did He
   not master you from head to foot? If you are really converted, it was
   not the conversion of the feelings only, or the intellect only--it was
   the subjugation of everything within you to that sweet power of His!
   You were quite broken down. You had no strength to stand up against Him
   any longer--and the joy of it was that you had not any wish to do so!
   When He was about to fix the chains of His love on you, you held out
   your hands saying, "Here, Lord, bind my wrists." You put forth your
   feet, crying, "Place the fetters here." You asked Him to cast a chain
   around your heart--you made a covenant with Him and agreed to be bound
   all over--for that part of you which was unbound, you reckoned to be
   enslaved and only that which He did bind, you considered to be free!
   When He had so mastered us, we longed to lie forever at His feet and
   weep ourselves away. Or we wished to sit forever at His feet and listen
   to His wondrous Words and learn His blessed teaching. Yet we also
   wanted to run about the world on His errands--it mattered not to us
   where He might send us--we would not make any choice of our sphere of
   service! If He would but employ us, that would be all we would ask. We
   wanted, then, to have a dozen lives and to spend them all for Him! Yes,
   we remember singing--

   "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer's praise!"

   We said--and we meant it--

   "Had I ten thousand hearts, dear Lord, I'd give them all to You,"

   and we did give ourselves up wholly to our Lord. We could not help
   doing so! We were carried right away, as when a mountain torrent comes,
   removes the earth from the young tree that is growing by the river side
   and gradually undermines it until the tree falls into the stream, and
   the current sweeps it on and on, and never lets it rest again, but
   bears it right down to the sea! So was it with us that blessed day when
   first we knew that we could call Christ, "Master and

   Lord."

   Brothers and Sisters, our Lord Jesus Christ has so completely mastered
   us that now, today, He is our only Master. It is not always a thing to
   ennoble a man when he is able to call another person his master, but we
   feel that the more fully we are mastered by Christ, the better will it
   be for us--and the more absolutely we can become His servants, the more
   noble and honored shall we be! In many passages of Scripture where our
   translation uses the term, "servant," the true word is, "slave," and I
   think the time has come when we had better speak of it as it ought to
   be, that we may learn the full force of the expression! We do not mean
   that there is any cruel slavery of Christ's people to Himself, but we
   do mean that just as much as the slave completely belonged to his
   master, to do his master's bidding, to live or die at his master's
   will, so have we given ourselves up to Christ! He has become our only
   Master. There are others who struggle for the mastery over us, but no
   man can serve two masters. He may serve two rival powers--one
   struggling against the other for a while--but they cannot both be
   masters. Only one can be supreme within the spirit. In this way Christ
   has become so completely the Believer's Master that sin shall not have
   dominion over him--and he shall not be any longer under the domination
   of Satan. Christ is the Master of all His people, whatever happens to
   them. We may wander like sheep, but Christ is still our Shepherd, and
   He will bring the straying sheep back, for they are still His property
   even when they are wandering away from Him!

   What do you say, Brothers and Sisters? Do you acknowledge any other
   master beside Christ? If you do, in that divided sovereignty you shall
   find ten thousand miseries! Oh, if your right eye is contrary to
   Christ, pluck it out and cast it from you! If your very life should
   stand up in rivalry with Christ, it would be much better for you that
   you should die than that you should lead such a life as that! Our Lord
   Jesus is our only Master!

   And what a choice Master He is! If we had had the opportunity, in our
   old state, of choosing our master, we were so blind and foolish that we
   would not have chosen Him. But if we had known, then, what we know,
   now, we would have chosen Him. And if we knew infinitely more about
   Him, we could never discover a reason why He should not be our Master,
   but we would continually find stronger arguments why we should be His
   servants forever! There was never such a Master as our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who took our nature that He might be able to master such
   servants as we are, who even died to win us and whose only mastership,
   after all, is that of love! He rules us sovereignly, yet in His hand is
   the silver scepter, not the rod of iron!

   Our Master is, at the same time, our Husband, whom we must obey. Oh, it
   is blessed to obey Him to whom our hearts are fully surrendered and in
   whom all loveliness is centered! When a husband truly loves his wife,
   it becomes easy for the wife to be obedient unto her husband and, as
   Christ loves us infinitely, we must love Him and serve Him in return.
   Look, by faith, into His blessed face--it is Jehovah's joy to look upon
   Him--and it shall be forever ours! Was there ever such another
   Countenance? Was ever such loveliness imagined as really exists in Him?
   Look at all His Character, from Bethlehem even until now--peep in upon
   Him in His loneliness, or see Him in the midst of the crowd and will
   you not say of Him, "He is the standard-bearer among ten thousand; yes,
   He is altogether lovely"? Pick out all the charms that ever could be
   found in the most amiable character, gather up all the virtues that
   ever glittered in the most spiritual man or woman, and bring them all
   here. Ah, but they are not worthy to be compared with the glory and
   beauty and excellency of the Well-Beloved! All theirgoodness came from
   Him, therefore let them all lie at His feet, for there is none to be
   compared with Him!

   Next, our spirit exultingly says, "As He is our choice Master, so He is
   our chosen Master Since He has chosen us, we have learned to choose
   Him." The love was, at first, all on His side, but now, through the
   effectual working of His Grace, it is on our side, too. We can, each
   one, say, "I love my Master. I love His house. I love His children. I
   love His service. I have chosen Him to be mine forever. If He should
   dismiss me from His service, I would come back to Him. If He gave me
   what men call, liberty, I would beg of Him to withdraw such accursed
   liberty and let me be, forever, and only, and completely, and entirely
   His, for, as He has chosen me by His Grace, so has His Grace led me to
   choose Him." I know that many of you can say the same and I daresay,
   while I have been speaking, you have been thinking of George Herbert's
   lines--

   "Howsweetly does 'my Master'sound! 'MyMaster!' As ambergris leaves a
   rich scent Unto the taster--

   So do these words give a sweet content An oriental fragrance, 'My
   Master.'"

   We delight to use this title concerning our Lord, for He is, further,
   our gracious Master. That word, "Master," seems to lose the idea of
   masterfulness when it is applied to Him. He is most graciously and
   wondrously our Lord, but yet we no more call Him, "Baali," that is, "my
   Lord," but we call Him, "Ishi," that is, "my Man," "my Husband." There
   is, truly, a service to which we are called, yet His message to His
   disciples was, "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant
   knows not what His lord does, but I have called you, Friends, for all
   things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you." We
   can never forget that with all His love, He is our Lord! It is our joy
   to remember that, yet what loving service we have received at His
   hands! He has been so much our servant that we have sometimes had to
   ask ourselves, "Who is the servant?" He is Servus Servorum--the Servant
   of Servants--as He proved when He washed His disciples' feet. He has
   done more than that for us, for He stooped so low as to be despised of
   men and rejected of the people in order that He might save us. Then,
   surely, it shall be our joy, bliss and glory to henceforth call Him
   Master and

   Lord!

   He is also our lifelong Master. No, that is a mistake, for there was,
   alas, a time when we lived, yet we lived not unto Him. Some of us were
   but boys when we first began to serve Him. I always feel glad to think
   that I wore a boy's jacket when I was baptized into His name. I had not
   assumed the garb of a man, but my whole soul was His and I was buried
   with Him. I wish it had been still earlier! O dear young people, there
   is no such joy as that of knowing Christ in your early youth! We hear,
   sometimes, of life-long teetotalers, but I could wish that I had been a
   life-long abstainer from self-righteousness, a life-long drinker of the
   river of the Water of Life! But, as all of us have failed to serve the
   Lord at the beginning of our life, let us try, with all our hearts, to
   serve Him right to the end! Oh, to have Him for our lifelong
   Master--with no little intervals of running away, no furloughs, no
   holidays!

   Brothers and Sisters, we have our recreations in Christ's service, but
   we never have any holidays. That is to say, He re-creates us, but He
   permits us to continue in His work without cessation or intermission.
   It would be no recreation for us to have a furlough from the great work
   of the Lord--we only wish that we could live, labor, spend ourselves
   and find our rest, as some birds do, on the wing--flying, mounting,
   singing and so resting and making this to be our continual joy! So, you
   see, we are in our Master's service for life. We have entered His
   employ and we are bound to Him--and "neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord"
   and Master--forever blessed be His name!

   II. Now I hasten, in the second place, to remind you that OUR BUSINESS
   IS TO SERVE OUR MASTER.

   That business is expressed in the Hebrew of our text by the word,
   "keep." I will read you the text as it should be rendered and as the
   translators will make it read if they use their senses in their
   revision of the Old Testament. That is, if they give the same meaning
   to a word in all places. The previous translators thought that the
   Bible would sound tautological if they gave the same translation of a
   word everywhere, so, to charm the ears, they changed the words. But
   then, alas, they sometimes changed the sense. Here, the original ought
   to be rendered thus--"Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit
   thereof: so he that keeps his master shall be honored." Is not that a
   wonderful word? In the interpretation I am giving to the passage, it
   means that as certainly as the farmer keeps and tends a fig tree, so
   you and I are to keep and tend Christ! Is it really true that He has
   committed Himself to our keeping? Yes! On earth, among the sons of men,
   there is One who keeps Israel, but Israel, in another sense, is made to
   be a keeper, and is to keep the Lord Jesus Christ!

   How are we to do that? Well, first, we must keep Him by always
   remaining His servants. We must keep Him as our Master. I like the idea
   of that man who once said to his master, "Sir, you talk about
   discharging me, but you see, Sir, if you don't know when you have a
   good servant, I know very well when I have a good master--and I don't
   mean to be discharged. If you put me out of the front door, I shall
   come in at the back, for I have been your servant ever since I was a
   boy. I was born in your father's house and I mean to die in this
   house." The gentleman saw that it was quite hopeless to try to get rid
   of the old man, as he would not go, so he decided they should not be
   parted. And I think some of us have come to the same point with our
   Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Truly, He knows that, in us, He has,
   even at our best, only unprofitable servants, but then He accepted us.
   He knew all that we were and all that we should be. He had a clear
   foresight of our whole future and He has still engaged us for life!

   Some of our friends think He only engaged them for a quarter or half a
   year, or for a limited period, but I know that He took me on for
   life--and for eternity, too! And my soul rejoices in the fact that He
   will keep to the bargain. Like the old man, I am determined that if He
   puts me out at the front door, I will come in at the back, for I know
   that I have a good Master and I will not leave Him. Do you not say the
   same, Beloved? Then hold on to Him and tell Him that you will not let
   Him go! Should He chasten you with the rod of men and lay many stripes
   on you, yet be like some dogs that seem to love their masters all the
   better the more they beat them! And so, dear Friends, love your Lord
   all the better when He treats you roughly--kiss the hand that smites
   you, and let this be your settled resolution--that from Him you will
   never go.

   What else are we to do in order to keep our Master? I think, next, we
   are to keep Him by defending Him. We must defend our Lord's name, honor
   and cause at all costs and all hazards. We must not let Him sleep like
   King Saul, with his spear stuck in the ground by his bolster, and his
   bodyguard asleep! But if the enemy should ever come to attack our
   Master, our watchword must be, "Up, guards, and at them!" Give them a
   warm reception from whatever quarter they may come. You and I, Beloved,
   are put in charge of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and every
   child of God is bound to be upon the defensive just as if the keeping
   of the Gospel depended entirely upon him. I believe that I am as much
   bound to preach against error, and to war for the Truth of Christ, as
   if there were not another minister living--and I think that every other
   minister stands in the same responsible position! And it is the same
   with every Christian. Keep your Master and all that He has in
   safety--let no traitor come near Him! Guard His ordinances, His
   doctrines, His precepts! Adore His matchless Person and extol His
   blessed work--and so keep Him against all comers.

   Then, dear Friends, keep Him by guarding all His interests. It is the
   duty of a servant to reckon that what belongs to his master is, in a
   certain sense, his, and, therefore, to be sacredly defended. I have
   heard of servants in the olden times, saying, "That is our park!" "This
   is our country house," or, "this is our town house!" "These are our
   horses" and one of them was heard by his master to say, "There come our
   children, bless their little hearts!" Well, they were no children of
   his, were they? Yes they were, for they were his master's children and
   he had become so identified with his master's interests that he
   regarded his master's children as belonging to him! So ought we to
   think of everything that appertains to

   Christ--and if the Lord has, anywhere, a little child who needs to be
   cared for, each of us who are His servants should be prepared to nurse
   it and watch over it for Him--and say to Him, with good Dr. Doddridge--

   "Have You a lamb in all Your flock I would disdain to feed? Have You a
   foe, before whose face I fear Your cause to plead?

   Thus, dear Friends, keep your Master! Watch over your Master's
   possessions! Guard your Master's Truth! Defend your Master's honor!
   Care for your Master's children! As far as your power goes, try to keep
   everything that belongs to Him, labor for the good of His cause,
   struggle for the advancement of His interests and for the overthrow of
   His adversaries, just as every loyal soldier seeks to preserve his
   sovereign's dominions intact and to keep his king's arms from suffering
   any dishonor. Thus let us keep our Master and all that belongs to Him.

   Now let us come back to our own Authorized Version--"he that waits on
   his master shall be honored." This also is a very good translation, if
   not equal to the other, and I think it conveys an important meaning for
   us. You and I are like servants who wait upon our Master. And that
   waiting consists, in part, in waiting for His orders, trying to
   ascertain what they are and, when we know them, waiting until He bids
   us carry them out. It is not intended that you and I should be
   inventors of rites, ceremonies, novelties of worship and all manner of
   strange doctrines! Our position is simply that of servants. Our Master
   has a certain way of setting out His Table and inviting His guests to
   it. And I have no business to go to Him and say, "Look how the king of
   Syria arranges histable? Is not that a better plan than Yours?" No,
   that would be utter disloyalty! I have to set the Table according to my
   Master's plan and custom. There are some old country squires who have
   acquired odd ways of their own and the servants whom they employ must
   drop into them, whatever their own notions may be. Now, the ways of the
   Lord are right--and it is your duty and mine to ask what they are and
   to conform our practice to them.

   The same rule is to be observed in matters of church government and
   discipline, in the ordinances of the Lord's house, in the Truths of God
   to be preached, and in the way we go about our Master's business. It is
   not for us to make our own laws, or to invent our own methods, but to
   wait upon our Master and learn His will concerning everything. If we do
   not do that, we shall get into a world of trouble! But if we wait upon
   Him for our orders and then obey the orders we receive from our Master,
   we shall be honored.

   Next, we must wait upon Him for strength to obey His orders; for if we
   do not, we shall either fail in our attempts, or else we shall fail
   altogether to make the attempt. We must also wait upon our Master,
   seeking His smile. I am afraid we do a great deal to get the smiles of
   our fellow men--and if they think we have done well, we congratulate
   ourselves. But, oh, to preach for the Master, to pray for the Master,
   to teach that class for the Master--not for your pastor! Not for the
   elders or deacons! Not for your fellow members, that they may say,
   "What a zeal for the Lord this person has!" Let it all be done for the
   Master! "He that waits on his master shall be honored." Do you not
   think that sometimes you and I wait upon ourselves, and that, while we
   are very busy and fancying we are working for the Lord, we may be doing
   it entirely for self? Because we find some sort of pleasure in it, we
   keep on doing it just for that pleasure, or because we feel that some
   kind of credit must come to ourselves as the result of it. If we are
   serving self, not our Master, we shall have a reward, but it will be a
   poor commonplace reward--like that of the Pharisees, of whom the Master
   said, "Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." That is the end
   of it! They have had their reward and they cannot expect to be paid
   twice for what they have done.

   We are, dear Friends, further to wait upon the Lord by expecting Him to
   fulfill His promises. And His promises will only be fulfilled in His
   own time. We are not to run before the Lord, nor to seek to hurry the
   Lord as though we thought He was slow in accomplishing His purposes. If
   we ever cry, "Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord," we
   shall probably receive for an answer, "Awake, awake! Put on your
   strength, O Zion." It is we who are asleep--the Lord never is. And so
   we are to wait upon Him and plead the promises that He has given us.

   This waiting also includes acquiescence in His will Not only doing it,
   but doing it willingly--being ready for anything that He may appoint.
   Perhaps lying on a sick bed for months. Why, if we never rose again and
   had to lie bedridden until we died, we ought to be perfectly willing to
   do so to wait on our Master! You remember the story of poor old Betty
   who said that the Lord told her to do this and that, and she tried to
   do it, and at last He said to her, "Betty, go upstairs and lie in your
   bed and cough." She said, "I am doing it, and I take satisfaction even
   in coughing if that is according to my Lord's will." If you have no
   will of your own in such matters, you will have very little sorrow. Our
   troubles mostly grow from the root of self-will--but when self-will is
   conquered and we hold ourselves entirely at God's disposal, then there
   is a sweetness even in wormwood and gall--and our heaviest cross
   becomes our joy and delight and we say, with holy Rutherford, "I find
   the Cross of Christ no more a burden to me than wings are to a bird, or
   sails are to a ship." That saintly man said that sometimes he felt so
   deeply in love with his cross that he almost feared lest his sufferings
   and grief should become so lovely to him as to be a rival to the Lord
   Jesus Christ. There is no such danger, I am afraid, with the most of
   us, for we are as bulls unaccustomed to the yoke--and we kick against
   the pricks. But if you can wait upon your Master and say, "Do with me
   as You will, Lord," all will be well. Try to be like the shepherd on
   Salisbury Plain, whose story should never be forgotten. When he was
   asked, "Is it good weather?" he answered, "Yes, it is all good weather
   that God sends." "But does this weather please you?" "If it pleases
   God, it pleases me," was his reply. That is the point to get to--may
   God bring us there by His Grace!

   III. When we get there, we shall come to our last point, OUR SERVICE
   WILL BRING US HONOR--"He that waits on his master shall be honored."

   Brothers and Sisters, the thought of waiting upon Christ and being His
   servant is an unspeakable honor! Therefore I will not try to speak
   about it, but ask youto just sit still and think about it. You are His
   servants, the servants of the eternal Son of God! Perhaps somebody is
   going to be made an earl or a duchess. I do not think that would be any
   honor to you, for you have already a higher honor than that, for you
   are a servant of the Lord! There will be a coronet for somebody to
   wear, but really, I do not see that it could add any luster to you, for
   you are a prince of the blood-royal of the skies! As for our pedigree,
   there is none like it. We do not trace it to the Normans, but to
   Calvary! We are of that seed that was to crush the serpent's head. Our
   coat of arms is much more ancient than any that the Heralds' College
   can ever issue! We need no other honor and can have no higher glory
   than to be servants of Christ! Are you only a little nurse-girl? Well,
   if you belong to Christ, you are one of those whom He counts right
   honorable! Are you a chimneysweep, my Brother? Never mind that--if the
   Lord has washed you in His precious blood, you are as noble as any peer
   of the realm and nobler than most of them! Do you have to go to the
   workhouse for weekly help? Never mind about your poverty--you are not
   so poor, now, as your Lord was--for He had nowhere to lay His head. Do
   not talk about being mean and obscure--why, you are descended from the
   King of Kings! "This honor have all His saints." "Unto you that
   believe, He is an honor"--that is the meaning of the Greek--and I take
   it that it is honor enough for us to have such a Savior to believe in
   and such a Master to serve!

   You shall have honor, dear Friends, among poor fellow Christians. If
   you really honor only your Master's name, it will not be long before
   they will honor and esteem you. I notice that the moment a man begins
   to seek honor for himself, he loses the esteem of his fellows. Do you
   ever hear any minister who preaches very grandly? If so, you think to
   yourself, "What a splendid preacher he is!" But you will find that, as
   a rule, God's people do not care much about him. Notice any worker in
   the church who wants to be very prominent and push himself
   forward--everybody desires to kick him! But there is another Brother
   who serves Christ in the rear rank and who blushes when he is pushed to
   the front--he is the man to whom his Brothers and Sisters look up to
   and though they may say little to him, they delight to honor him in
   their hearts. Perhaps the most honorable thing in Christ's house is the
   doormat--when all the brethren wipe their dirty boots upon it, they are
   so much the cleaner.

   1 know some people who do not like to be in the position of the
   doormat--if a person brushes against them, they cry, "What a shame!" It
   is a great honor to do anything for your Master's children which will
   be for their good. In the Kingdom of God, the way to go up is to go
   down--and the way to grow great is to grow little. Look at little
   Paul-- that man short of stature and with many infirmities. Why, he is
   the biggest of all the Apostles! And what is "great Paul"? Oh, he is
   only sounding brass and the less we hear of him, the better. Get to be
   like little Paul, Brother, and your sound shall go out to the very ends
   of the earth! Whereas if you are ever a big Paul, you will only give
   out a brazen note which will be heard for a very little way. If the
   Lord Jesus Christ has made us to be His servants, let us count it our
   highest honor to be a servant of the least of Hisservantsso that we may
   bless them and glorify Him!

   But our highest honor is yet to come.It is in that day when Christ
   shall call His chosen ones to His own right hand to reign with Him. It
   is when He shall appoint unto them a Kingdom even as His Father
   appointed it to Him. It is when he who was faithful in a few things
   shall be made ruler over many things in the Kingdom of the Master
   forever and forever! I think I see the King coming into His court--it
   is crowded with cherubim and seraphim and all the shining ones that
   form His royal retinue! There they stand in all their gorgeous glory
   and the Master, from the Throne, looks over all their ranks as He
   accepts their loyal and reverent homage. But He is looking for one poor
   man who on earth loved Him and who kept the faith under much derision
   and scorn. At last He spies him out and says, "Make way, My angelic
   servants! Cherubim and seraphim, stand in line and let him come! This
   man was with Me in My humiliation, as you could not be. For Me he bore
   the cross and was despised. Make way and let him come and sit with Me,
   for they who have been with Me in My humiliation shall be with Me in My
   glory."

   Oh, that you and I, dear Friends, may have that honor at the last! And
   what will we do when we get it? Why, we will cast our crowns at our
   Savior's feet and say to Him, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Your
   name be all the praise and glory forever!" And in that very deed we
   shall find the highest honor of all! And we shall then, perhaps,
   remember this Thursday evening and this text, "He that waits on his
   master shall be honored." The Lord bless you all, for Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW25:14-30.

   Verse 14. For the kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far
   country, who called his servants and delivered unto them his goods.
   This parable has to do with you who are professors of Christianity. He,
   "called his servants," those who, by their own consent, were numbered
   among his household servitors. "He called his servants and delivered
   unto them his goods." Not theirs, but his! And therefore to be used
   forhim. If you are Christ's servant, your abilities are His, He has
   lent them to you to be employed for your Lord. "He called his servants
   and delivered unto them his goods."

   15. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another
   one; to every man according to his ability; and straightway took his
   journey. He is gone. Our Lord has risen and we, His servants, are left
   behind to trade with His goods for His glory.

   16-18. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
   the same, and made them another five talents. And likewise he that had
   received two, he also gained another two. But he that had received one
   went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money. We are grieved to
   know that there are persons with five talents and others with two
   talents who do as this man did--but the case is put in this way so as
   to reach us all. Since most persons have but one talent, they are the
   most often found, each one, saying, "I have so little ability, I will
   not do anything. If I had five talents, I might become distinguished.
   If I had two, I might be very useful. But with only one, I need not
   attempt anything. I am a private person--a mother, quite obscure, with
   my little family around me--what can I do?" It is very often a strong
   temptation from Satan to those who have but one talent, to make them
   think that they may, with impunity, hide that one. And then, you see,
   the argument cuts the other way. If it is wrong to hide one talent, it
   is much more wrong to hide two, and far worse to dig in the earth and
   bury five!

   19. After a long time the lord of those servants returned and reckoned
   with them. Always remember the reckoning. We have heard of one who went
   into a house of entertainment and fed most luxuriously. But, when the
   landlord brought him the bill, he said, "Oh, I never thought of that!"
   And there are many who spend their whole lives without ever thinking of
   the reckoning--yet it must come, and for every hour, for every
   opportunity, for every ability, for every sin and for every omission of
   duty, they must give account! "The lord of those servants returned and
   reckoned with them."

   20, 21. And so he that had received five talents came and brought
   another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered unto me five talents:
   behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto
   him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful
   over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you
   into the joy of your lord. I do not doubt that this man had often
   reckoned with himself--for he that never reckons with himself may well
   be afraid of being called to reckon with his God--and I expect that he
   had often grieved to think that he had not turned the five talents into
   twenty. He must have thought that to gain only five talents more was
   very little. But he found his master was well content with what he had
   done. Do you think, Brothers and Sisters, that all of you who have five
   talents have gained five talents more? You were richly endowed as a
   youth--have you increased the ability to serve your God? You see the
   parable speaks not so much of what they had done for other people, as
   of what they had themselves gained and still had in hand! Have you more
   Grace? Have you more tact? Have you more adaptation to your Master's
   service? Are you conscious that it is so? I should not wonder if you
   are mourning that you are not more useful and more fit to be used. It
   is well that you should mourn in that way, but when your Master comes,
   I trust that He will say, "Well done, you good and faithful servant."

   22, 23. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you
   delivered unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents
   beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful
   servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I shall make you
   ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord. That is a
   beautiful reward--not so much to have a joy of our own as to enter into
   the joy of our Lord! It is not a servant's portion that is given to
   us--it is the Master's portion sharedby His servants. How it ennobles
   Christian work to feel that it is not simply our work, but work done by
   the Master through the servant--and the reward shall not so much be our
   joy as our entrance into our Master's joy! That is, indeed, giving to
   us the best of the best in return for our poor service here!

   24, 25. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
   I knew you that you are an hard man, reaping where you have not sown,
   and gathering where you have not scattered: and I was afraid, and went
   and hid your talent in the earth: lo, there you have what is yours. "I
   was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth." See, Friends,
   how fear may often be the mother of presumption? Confidence in God
   begets holy fear, but unholy fear begets a doubt of God and leads us to
   desperate rebellion of unbelief. God save us from such fear!

   26, 27. His lord answered and said unto him, You wicked and slothful
   servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I
   have not scattered? You ought therefore to have put my money in the
   bank, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.
   His lord took him on his own ground and condemned him out of his own
   mouth.

   28. 29. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
   has ten talents. For unto everyone that has shall be given, and he
   shall have abundance. He that has faith shall have more faith. He that
   has a secret taste for heavenly things shall have a greater love for
   them. He that has some understanding of the Truth of God shall get more
   understanding of it. God gives to those that have--it is equally true
   that He gives to those who confess that they have not.

   29. But from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he
   has. If you need an instance of taking away from a man what he has
   not--you may have seen it sometimes in the case of a person without any
   education or knowledge who is quite content to remain in that
   condition. But, all of a sudden he is introduced into learned
   society--he hears what educated people have to say, and he exclaims,
   "What a fool I am!" What he thought he had, though he never had it,
   suddenly goes from him!

   30. And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall
   be weeping and gnashing of teeth. If we give any description of the
   world to come which is at all terrible, those who reject the Scriptures
   begin to cry out that we have borrowed it from Dante, or taken it from
   Milton! But I take leave to say that the most awful and harrowing
   descriptions of the woes of the lost that ever fell from human lips do
   not exceed or even equal the language of the loving Christ, Himself!
   Listen--"Cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall
   be weeping and gnashing of teeth." He is the true lover of men's souls
   who does not deceive them! He that paints the miseries of Hell as
   though they were but little is seeking to murder men's souls under the
   pretense of being their friend! May God give all of you Grace to trust
   in Jesus for yourselves and then to point others to Him, for Christ's
   sake! Amen.

The Last Words of Christ on the Cross

   (No. 2644)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 15, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   25, 1882.

   "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your
   hands I commend My spirit: and having said this, He gave up the ghost"
   Luke 23:46.

   "Into Your hands I commit my spirit: You have redeemed me, O LORD God
   of Truth."

   Psalm 31:5.

   "And they stoned Stephen, as he was calling upon God and asking, Lord
   Jesus, receive my spirit."

   Acts 7:59.

   THIS morning, dear Friends, I spoke upon the first recorded words of
   our Lord Jesus [Sermon #1666, Volume 28--The First Recorded Words of
   Jesus] when He said to His mother and to Joseph, "How is it that you
   sought Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"
   Now, by the help of the blessed Spirit, we will consider the last words
   of our Lord Jesus before He gave up the ghost. And with them we will
   examine two other passages in which similar expressions are used.

   The words, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit," if we judge
   them to be the last which our Savior uttered before His death, ought to
   be coupled with those other words, "It is finished," which some have
   thought were actually the last He used. I think it was not so, but,
   anyway, these utterances must have followed each other very quickly and
   we may blend them together. And then we shall see how very similar they
   are to His first words as we explained them this morning. There is the
   cry, "It is finished," which you may read in connection with our
   Authorized Version--"Did you not know that I must be about My Father's
   business?" That business was all finished--He had been about it all His
   life and now that He had come to the end of His days, there was nothing
   left undone--and He could say to His Father, "I have finished the work
   which You gave Me to do."

   Then if you take the other utterance of our Lord on the Cross, "Father,
   into your hands I commend My spirit," see how well it agrees with the
   other reading of our morning text, "Did you not know that I must be in
   My Father's house?" Jesus is putting Himself into the Father's hands
   because He had always desired to be there, in the Father's house with
   the Father. And now He is committing His spirit, as a sacred trust,
   into the Father's hands that He may depart to be with the Father, to
   abide in His house, and go no more out forever.

   Christ's life is all of a piece, just as the alpha and the omega are
   letters of the same alphabet. You do not find Him one thing at the
   first, another thing afterwards, and a third thing still later--He is
   "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever." There is a
   wondrous similarity about everything that Christ said and did. You
   never need write the name, "Jesus," under any of His sayings as you
   have to put the names of human writers under their sayings, for there
   is no mistaking any sentence that He has uttered!

   If there is anything recorded as having been done by Christ, a
   believing child can judge whether it is authentic or not. Those
   miserable false gospels that were brought out did very little, if any
   mischief, because nobody with any true spiritual discernment was ever
   duped into believing them to be genuine! It is possible to manufacture
   a spurious coin which will, for a time, pass for a good one, but it is
   not possible to make even a passable imitation of what Jesus Christ has
   said and done! Everything about Christ is like Himself--there is a
   Christ-likeness about it which cannot be mistaken! This morning, for
   instance, when I preached about the Holy Child Jesus, I am sure you
   must have felt that there was never another child as He was. And in His
   death He was as unique as in His birth, childhood and life. There was
   never another who died as He did and there was never another who lived
   altogether as He did. Our Lord Jesus Christ stands by Himself! Some of
   us try to imitate Him, but how feebly do we follow in His steps! The
   Christ of God still stands by Himself and He has no rival!

   I have already intimated to you that I am going to have three texts for
   my sermon, but when I have spoken upon all three of them, you will see
   that they are so much alike that I might have been content with one of
   them.

   I. I invite you first to consider OUR SAVIOR'S WORDS JUST BEFORE HIS
   DEATH. "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit."

   Here observe, first, how Christ lives and passes away in the atmosphere
   of the Word of God. Christ was a grand original thinker and He might
   always have given us words of His own. He never lacked suitable
   language, for, "never man spoke like this Man." Yet you must have
   noticed how continually He quoted Scripture--the great majority of His
   expressions may be traced to the Old Testament. Even where they are not
   exact quotations, His words drop into Scriptural shape and form! You
   can see that the Bible has been His one Book. He is evidently familiar
   with it from the first page to the last and not with its letter, only,
   but with the innermost soul of its most secret sense and, therefore,
   when dying, it seemed but natural for Him to use a passage from a Psalm
   of David as His expiring words. In His death, He was not driven beyond
   the power of quiet thought--He was not unconscious, He did not die of
   weakness--He was strong even while He was dying! It is true that He
   said, "I thirst," but, after He had been a little refreshed, He cried
   with a loud voice, as only a strong man could, "It is finished!" And
   now, before He bows His head in the silence of death, He utters His
   final words, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit." Our Lord
   might, I say again, have made an original speech as His dying
   declaration. His mind was clear, calm, and undisturbed--in fact, He was
   perfectly happy, for He had said, "It is finished!" So His sufferings
   were over and He was already beginning to enjoy a taste of the sweets
   of victory. Yet, with all that clearness of mind, freshness of
   intellect and fluency of words that might have been possible to Him, He
   did not invent a new sentence, but He went to the Book of Psalms and
   took from the Holy Spirit this expression," Into Your hands I commend
   My spirit."

   How instructive to us is this great Truth of God that the Incarnate
   Word lived on the Inspired Word! It was food to Him, as it is to us
   and, Brothers and Sisters, if Christ thus lived upon the Word of God,
   should not you and I do the same? He, in some respects, did not need
   this Book as much as we do. The Spirit of God rested upon Him without
   measure, yet He loved the Scripture and He went to it, studied it and
   used its expressions continually. Oh, that you and I might get into the
   very heart of the Word of God and get that Word into ourselves! As I
   have seen the silkworm eat into the leaf and consume it, so ought we to
   do with the Word of the Lord--not crawl over its surface, but eat right
   into it till we have taken it into our inmost parts! It is idle to
   merely let the eyes glance over the Words, or to remember the poetical
   expressions, or the historic facts--but it is blessed to eat into the
   very soul of the Bible until, at last, you come to talk in Scriptural
   language and your very style is fashioned upon Scripture models--and,
   what is still better, your spirit is flavored with the words of the
   Lord!

   I would quote John Bunyan as an instance of what I mean. Read anything
   of his and you will see that it is almost like reading the Bible
   itself. He had studied our Authorized Version, which will never be
   bettered, as I judge, till Christ shall come. He had read it till his
   very soul was saturated with Scripture and though his writings are
   charmingly full of poetry, yet he cannot give us his Pilgrim's
   Progress--that sweetest of all prose poems--without continually making
   us feel and say, "Why, this man is a living Bible!" Prick him
   anywhere--his blood is Bibline--the very essence of the Bible flows
   from him! He cannot speak without quoting a text, for his very soul is
   full of the Word of God. I commend His example to you, Beloved and,
   still more, the example of our Lord Jesus! If the Spirit of God is in
   you, He will make you love the Word of God and, if any of you imagine
   that the Spirit of God will lead you to dispense with the Bible, you
   are under the influence of another spirit which is not the Spirit of
   God at all! I trust that the Holy Spirit will endear to you every page
   of this Divine Record so that you will feed upon it and, afterwards,
   speak it out to others. I think it is well worthy of your constant
   remembrance that, even in death, our blessed Master showed the ruling
   passion of His spirit so that His last words were a quotation from
   Scripture.

   Now notice, secondly, that our Lord, in the moment of His death,
   recognized a personal God. "Father, into Your hands I commend My
   spirit." God is to some men an unknown God. "There may be a God," so
   they say, but they get no nearer the truth than that. "All things are
   God," says another. "We cannot be sure that there is a God," say
   others, "and, therefore, it is no use our pretending to believe in Him
   and so to be, possibly, influenced by a supposition." Some people say,
   "Oh, certainly, there is a God, but He is very far off! He does not
   come near to us and we cannot imagine that He will interfere in our
   affairs." Ah, but our blessed Lord Jesus Christ believed in no such
   impersonal, pantheistic, dreamy, far-off God, but in One to whom He
   said, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit." His language shows
   that He realized the Personality of God as much as I would recognize
   the personality of a banker if I said to him, "Sir, I commit that money
   into your hands." I know that I should not say such a thing as that to
   a mere dummy, or to an abstract something or nothing--but I would say
   it to a living man and I would say it only to a living man.

   So, Beloved, men do not commit their souls into the keeping of
   impalpable nothings! They do not, in death, smile as they resign
   themselves to the infinite unknown, the cloudy "Father of everything,"
   who may be nothing or everything. No, no, we only trust what we know!
   And so Jesus knew the Father, and knew Him to be a real Person having
   hands-- and into those hands He commended His departing spirit. I am
   not now speaking materially, mark you, as though God had hands like
   ours, but He is an actual Being, who has powers of action, who is able
   to deal with men as He pleases and who is willing to take possession of
   their spirits and to protect them forever and ever. Jesus speaks like
   one who believed that and I pray that, both in life and in death, you
   and I may always deal with God in the same way. We have far too much
   fiction in religion--and a religion of fiction will bring only
   fictitious comfort in the dying hour. Come to solid facts! Is God as
   real to you as you are to yourself? Come now, do you speak with Him,
   "as a man speaks unto his friend"? Can you trust Him and rely upon Him
   as you trust and rely upon the partner of your bosom? If your God is
   unreal, your religion is unreal! If your God is a dream, your hope will
   be a dream and woe be unto you when you shall wake up out of it!

   It was not so that Jesus trusted. "Father," He said, "into Your hands I
   commend My spirit."

   But, thirdly, here is a still better point. Observe how Jesus Christ
   here brings out the Fatherhood of God. The Psalm from which He quoted
   did not say, "Father." David did not get as far as that in words,
   though in spirithe often did. But Jesus had the right to alter the
   Psalmist's words. He can improve on Scripture, though you and I cannot.
   He did not say, "O God, into Your hands I commend My spirit." He said,
   "Father." Oh, that sweet word! That was the gem of our thought, this
   morning, that Jesus said, "Did you not know that I must be at My
   Father's--that I must be in My Father's house!" Oh, yes, the Holy Child
   knew that He was especially and, in a peculiar sense, the Son of the
   Highest, and therefore He said, "My Father." And, in dying, His
   expiring heart was buoyed up and comforted with the thought that God
   was His Father. It was because He said that God was His Father that
   they put Him to death, yet He still stood to it even in His dying hour
   and said, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit"!

   What a blessed thing it is for us, also, my Brothers and Sisters, to
   die conscious that we are children of God! Oh, how sweet, in life and
   in death, to feel in our soul the spirit of adoption whereby we cry,
   "Abba, Father"! In such a case as that--

   "It is not death to die."

   Quoting the Savior's words, "It is finished," and relying upon His
   Father and our Father, we may go even into the jaws of death without
   the "quivering lips" of which we sang just now. Joyful, with all the
   strength we have, our lips may confidently sing, challenging death and
   the grave to silence our ever-rising and swelling music! O my Father,
   my Father, if I am in your hands, I may die without fear!

   There is another thought, however, which is perhaps the best one of
   all. From this passage we learn that our Divine Lord cheerfully
   rendered up His soul to His Father when the time had come for Him to
   die. "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit." None of us can,
   with strict propriety, use these words. When we come to die, we may
   perhaps utter them and God will accept them--these were the very
   death-words of Polycarp, Bernard, Luther, Melanchthon, Jerome of
   Prague, John Huss and an almost endless list of saints--"Into Your
   hands I commend my spirit." The Old Testament rendering of the passage,
   or else our Lord's version of it, has been turned into a Latin prayer
   and commonly used among Romanists almost as a charm--they have repeated
   the Latin words when dying, or, if they were unable to do so, the
   priest repeated the words for them, attaching a sort of magical power
   to that particular formula! But, in the sense in which our Savior
   uttered these words, we cannot, any of us, fully use them. We can
   commit or commend our spirit to God, but yet, Brothers and Sisters,
   remember that unless the Lord comes first, we must die--and dying is
   not an acton our part. We have to be passive in the process because it
   is no longer in our power to retain our life. I suppose that if a man
   could have such control of his life, it might be questionable when he
   would surrender it because suicide is a crime and no man can be
   required to kill himself. God does not demand such action as that at
   any man's hands and, in a certain sense, that is what would happen
   whenever a man yielded himself to death.

   But there was no necessity for our blessed Lord and Master to die
   except the necessity which He had taken upon Himself in becoming the
   Substitute for His people! There was no necessity for His death even at
   the last moment upon the Cross, for, as I have reminded you, He cried
   with a loud voice when natural weakness would have compelled Him to
   whisper or to sigh. But His life was strong within Him--if He had
   willed to do so, He could have unloosed the nails and come down into
   the midst of the crowd that stood mocking Him! He died of His own free
   will, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." A man
   may righteously surrender his life for the good of his country and for
   the safety of others. There have frequently been opportunities for men
   to do this and there have been brave fellows who have worthily done it.
   But all those men would have had to die at some time or other. They
   were only slightly anticipating the payment of the debt of nature. But,
   in our Lord's case, He was rendering up to the Father the sprit which
   He might have kept if He had chosen to do so. "No man takes it from
   Me," He said concerning His life. "I lay it down of Myself."

   And there is here a cheerful willingness to yield up His spirit into
   His Father's hands! It is rather remarkable that none of the
   Evangelists describe our Lord as dying. He did die, but they all speak
   of Him as giving up the ghost-- surrendering to God His spirit. You and
   I passively die, but He actively yielded up His spirit to His Father.
   In His case, death was an act and He performed that act from the
   glorious motive of redeeming us from death and Hell! So, in this sense,
   Christ stands alone in His death.

   But, oh, dear Brothers and Sisters, if we cannot render up our spirit
   as He did, yet, when our life is taken from us, let us be perfectly
   ready to give it up! May God bring us into such a state of mind and
   heart that there shall be no struggling to keep our life, but a sweet
   willingness to let it be just as God would have it--a yielding up of
   everything into His hands, feeling sure that, in the world of spirits,
   our soul shall be quite safe in the Father's hands and that, until the
   Resurrection Day, the life-germ of the body will be securely in His
   keeping, and certain that when the trumpet shall sound, spirit, soul
   and body--that trinity of our manhood--shall be reunited in the
   absolute perfection of our being to behold the King in His beauty in
   the land that is very far off! When God calls us to die, it will be a
   sweet way of dying if we can, like our Lord, pass away with a text of
   Scripture upon our lips, with a personal God ready to receive us, with
   that God recognized distinctly as our Father and so die joyously,
   resigning our will entirely to the sweet will of the ever-blessed One,
   and saying, "It is the Lord." "My Father." "Let Him do as seems good to
   Him."

   II. My second text is in the 31st Psalm, at the 5th verse. And it is
   evidently the passage which our Savior had in His mind just then "Into
   Your hands I commit my spirit: You have redeemed me, O Lord God of
   Truth." It seems to me that THESE ARE WORDS TO BE USED IN LIFE, for
   this Psalm is not so much concerning the Believer's death as concerning
   his life.

   Is it not very amazing, dear Friends, that the words which Jesus
   uttered on the Cross you may still continue to use? You may catch up
   their echo and not only when you come to die, but tonight, tomorrow
   morning and as long as you are alive, you may still repeat the text the
   Master quoted, and say, "Into Your hands I commit my spirit."

   That is to say, first, let us cheerfully entrust our souls to God and
   feel that they are quite safe in His hands. Our spirit is the noblest
   part of our being; our body is only the husk, our spirit is the living
   kernel, so let us put it into God's keeping. Some of you have never yet
   done that, so I invite you to do it now. It is the act of faith which
   saves the soul, that act which a man performs when he says, "I trust
   myself to God as He reveals Himself in Christ Jesus. I cannot keep
   myself, but He can keep me and, by the precious blood of Christ He can
   cleanse me. So I just take my spirit and give it over into the great
   Father's hands." You never really live till you do that! All that comes
   before that act of full surrender is death! But when you have once
   trusted Christ, then you have truly begun to live. And every day, as
   long as you live, take care that you repeat this process and cheerfully
   leave yourselves in God's hands without any reserve. That is to say,
   give yourself up to God--your body, to be healthy or to be sick, to be
   long-lived or to be suddenly cut off. Your soul and spirit, give them,
   also, up to God, to be made happy or to be made sad, just as He
   pleases. Give Your whole self up to Him and say to Him, "My Father,
   make me rich or make me poor, give me sight or make me blind. Let me
   have all my senses or take them away. Make me famous or leave me to be
   obscure. I give myself up to You--into Your hands I commit my spirit. I
   will no longer exercise my own choice, but You shall choose My
   inheritance for me. My times are in Your hands."

   Now, dear children of God, are you always doing this? Have you ever
   done it? I am afraid that there are some, even among Christ's
   professing followers, who kick against God's will and even when they
   say to God, "Your will be done," they spoil it by adding, in their own
   mind, "and my will, too." They pray, "Lord, make my will Your will,"
   instead of saying, "Make Your will my will." Let us each one pray this
   prayer every day, "Into Your hands I commit my spirit." I like, at
   family prayer, to put myself and all that I have into God's hands in
   the morning--and then, at night, to just look between His hands and see
   how safe I have been. And then to say to Him, "Lord, shut me up again
   tonight! Take care of me all through the night watches. 'Into Your
   hands I commit my spirit.'"

   Notice, dear Friends, that our second text has these words at the end
   of it--"You have redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth." Is not that a good
   reason for giving yourself up entirely to God? Christ has redeemed you
   and, therefore, you belong to Him. If I am a redeemed man and I ask God
   to take care of me, I am but asking the King to take care of one of His
   own jewels--a jewel that cost Him the blood of His heart!

   And I may still more especially expect that He will do so, because of
   the title which is here given to Him--"You have redeemed me, O Lord God
   of Truth." Would He be the God of Truth if He began with redemption and
   ended with destruction--if He began by giving His Son to die for us and
   then kept back other mercies which we daily need to bring us to Heaven?
   No, the gift of His Son is the pledge that He will save His people from
   their sins and bring them home to Glory--and He will do it. So, every
   day, go to Him with this declaration, "Into Your hands I commit my
   spirit." No, not only every day, but all through the day! Does a horse
   run away with you? Then you cannot do better than say, "Father, into
   Your hands I commit my spirit." And if the horse does not run away with
   you, you cannot do better than say the same words! Have you to go into
   a house where there is fever? I mean, is it your duty to go there? Then
   go saying, "Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit." I would advise
   you to do this every time you walk down the street, or even while you
   sit in your own house.

   Dr. Gill, my famous predecessor, spent very much time in his study and,
   one day, somebody said to him, "Well, at any rate, the studious man is
   safe from most of the accidents of life." It so happened that one
   morning, when the good man left his familiar armchair for a little
   while, there came a gale of wind that blew down a stack of chimneys
   which crashed through the roof and fell right into the place where he
   would have been sitting if the Providence of God had not just then
   drawn him away! And he said, "I see that we need Divine Providence to
   care for us in our studies just as much as in the streets." "Father,
   into Your hands I commit my spirit." I have often noticed that if any
   of our friends get into accidents and troubles, it is usually when they
   are away for a holiday. It is a curious thing, but I have often
   remarked about it. They go out for their health and come home sick!
   They leave us with all their limbs whole and return to us crippled!
   Therefore we must pray God to take special care of friends in the
   country or by the sea--and we must commit ourselves to His hands
   wherever we may be. If we had to go into a leper colony, we would
   certainly ask God to protect us from the deadly leprosy. But we ought
   to equally seek the Lord's protection while dwelling in the healthiest
   place or in our own homes!

   David said to the Lord, "Into Your hands I commit my spirit." But let
   me beg you to add that word which our Lord inserted--"Father." David is
   often a good guide for us, but David's Lord is far better. And if we
   follow Him, we shall improve upon David. So, let us each say, "Father,
   Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit." That is a sweet way of
   living every day--committing everything to our Heavenly Father's hands,
   for those hands can do His child no unkind-ness. "Father, I might not
   be able to trust Your angels, but I can trust You." The Psalmist does
   not say, "Into the hand of Providence I commit my spirit." Do you
   notice how men try to get rid of God by saying, "Providence did this,"
   and, "Providence did that," and, "Providence did the other"? If you ask
   them, "What is Providence?"--they will probably reply, "Well,
   Providence is Providence." That is all they can say.

   There is many a man who talks very confidently about reverencing
   nature, obeying the laws of nature, noting the powers of nature and so
   on. Step up to that eloquent lecturer and say to him, "Will you kindly
   explain to me what nature is?" He answers, "Why, nature--well, it
   is--nature." Just so, Sir, but, what is nature? And he says,
   "Well--well--it is nature." And that is all you will get out of him.
   Now, I believe in nature and I believe in Providence, but at the back
   of everything, I believe in God, and in the God who has hands--not in
   an idol that has no hands and can do nothing--but in the God to whom I
   can say, "'Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit.' I rejoice that
   I am able to put myself there, for I feel absolutely safe in trusting
   myself to Your keeping." So live, Beloved, and you shall live safely,
   happily and you shall have hope in your life, and hope in your death!

   III. My third text will not detain us many minutes. It is intended to
   explain to us THE USE OF OUR SAVIOR'S DYING WORDS FOR OURSELVES. Turn
   to the account of the death of Stephen, in the 7th chapter of Acts, at
   the 59th verse, and you will see, there, how far a man of God may dare
   to go in his last moments in quoting from David and from the Lord Jesus
   Christ. "And they stoned Stephen, as he was calling upon God and
   saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." So here is a text for us to use
   when we come to die--"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." I have explained
   to you that, strictly, we can hardly talk of yielding up our spirit,
   but we may speak of Christ receivingit and say with Stephen, "Lord
   Jesus, receive my spirit."

   What does this prayer mean? I must just hurriedly give you two or three
   thoughts concerning it and so close my discourse. I think this prayer
   means that, if we can die as Stephen did, we shall die with a certainty
   of immortality Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." He did
   not say, "I am afraid my poor spirit is going to die." No, the spirit
   is something which still exists after death, something which Christ can
   receive and, therefore, Stephen asks Him to receive it! You and I are
   not going upstairs to die as if we were only like cats and dogs--we go
   up there to die like immortal beings who fall asleep on earth and open
   our eyes in Heaven! Then, at the sound of the archangel's trumpet, our
   very body is to rise to dwell, again, with our spirit--we have not any
   question about this matter! I think I have told you what an infidel
   once said to a Christian man, "Some of you Christians have great fear
   in dying because you believe that there is another state to follow this
   one. I have not the slightest fear, for I believe that I shall be
   annihilated and, therefore, all fear of death is gone from me." "Yes,"
   said the Christian, "and in that respect you seem to me to be on equal
   terms with that bull grazing over there, which, like yourself, is free
   from any fear of death. Pray, Sir, let me ask you a simple question.
   Have you any hope?" "Hope, Sir? Hope, Sir? No, I have no hope! Of
   course I have no hope, Sir." "Ah, then!" replied the other, "despite
   the fears that sometimes come over feeble Believers, they have a hope
   which they would not and could not give up." And that hope is that our
   spirit--even that spirit which we commit into Jesus Christ's
   hands--shall be "forever with the Lord."

   The next thought is that, to a man who can die as Stephen did, there is
   a certainty that Christ is near--so near that the man speaks to Him and
   says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." In Stephen's case, the Lord
   Jesus was so near that the martyr could see Him, for he said, "Behold,
   I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand
   of God." Many dying saints have borne a similar testimony. It is no
   strange thing for us to hear them say, before they die, that they could
   see within the pearly gates and they have told us this with such
   evident truthfulness, and with such rapture, or sometimes so calmly--in
   such a businesslike tone of voice--we were sure that they were neither
   deceived nor speaking falsehood. They spoke what they knew to be true,
   for Jesus was there with them! Yes, Beloved, before you can call your
   children around your deathbed, Jesus will already be there! And into
   His hands you may commit your spirit.

   Moreover, there is a certainty that we are quite safe in His hands.
   Wherever else we are insecure, if we ask Him to receive our spirit, and
   He receives it, who can hurt us? Who can pluck us out of His hands?
   Awaken, Death and hail! Come forth, all you powers of darkness! What
   can you do when once a spirit is in the hands of the Omnipotent
   Redeemer? We will be safe there!

   Then there is the other certainty, that He is quite willing to take us
   into His hands. Let us put ourselves into His hands now--and then we
   need not be ashamed to repeat the operation every day and we may be
   sure that we shall not be rejected at the last. I have often told you
   of the good old woman who was dying and to whom someone said, "Are you
   not afraid to die?" "Oh, no," she replied, "there is nothing at all to
   fear. I have dipped my foot in the river of death every morning before
   I have had my breakfast, and I am not afraid to die now." You remember
   that dear saint who died in the night, and who had left written on a
   piece of paper by her bedside these lines which, before she fell
   asleep, she felt strong enough to pencil down?--

   "Since Jesus is mine, I'll not fear undressing, But gladly put off
   these garments of clay--

   To die in the Lord, is a Covenant blessing, Since Jesus to Glory thro'
   death led the way."

   It was well that she could say it--and may we be able to say the same
   whenever the Master calls us to go up higher! I want, dear Friends,
   that we should, all of us, have as much willingness to depart as if it
   were a matter of will with us! Blessed be God it is not left to our
   choice--it is not left to our will when we shall die. God has appointed
   that day and ten thousand devils cannot consign us to the grave before
   our time! We shall not die till God decrees it--

   "Plagues and deaths around me fly,

   Till He please I cannot die!

   Not a single shaft can hit

   Till the God of love sees fit."

   But let us be just as willing to depart as if it were really a matter
   of choice, for, wisely, carefully, coolly consider that if it were left
   to us, we should none of us be wise if we did not choose to go! Apart
   from the coming of our Lord, the most miserable thing that I know of
   would be a suspicion that we might not die. Do you know what quaint old
   Rowland Hill used to say when he found himself getting very old? He
   said, "Surely they must be forgetting me up there." And every now and
   then, when some dear old saint was dying, he would say, "When you get
   to Heaven, give my love to John Ber-ridge, and John Bunyan and ever so
   many more of the good Johns, and tell them I hope they will see poor
   old Rowley up there before long." Well, there was common sense in that
   wishing to get Home, longing to be with God. To be with Christ is far
   better than to be here!

   Sobriety itself would make us choose to die! Well, then, do not let us
   run back and become utterly unwilling and struggle and strive and fret
   and fume over it. When I hear of Believers who do not like to talk
   about death, I am afraid concerning them. It is greatly wise to be
   familiar with our resting place. When I went, recently, to the cemetery
   at Norwood, to lay the body of our dear Brother Perkins there for a
   little while, I felt that it was a healthy thing for me to stand at the
   grave's brink and to walk amid that forest of memorials of the dead,
   for this is where I, too, must go. You living men, come and view the
   ground where you must shortly lie and, as it must be so, let us who are
   Believers welcome it!

   But, what if you are not Believers? Ah, that is another matter
   altogether! If you have not believed in Christ, you may well be afraid
   even to rest on the seat where you are sitting! I wonder that the earth
   itself does not say, "O God, I will not hold this wretched sinner up
   any longer! Let me open my mouth and swallow him!" All nature must hate
   the man who hates God! Surely, all things must loathe to minister to
   the life of a man who does not live unto God. Oh that you would seek
   the Lord and trust Christ and find eternal life! If you have done so,
   do not be afraid to go forth to live, or to die, just as God pleases.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN151-8.

   Verse 1. I am the true vine. Now we know where to find the true Church.
   It is to be found only in Christ and in those who are joined to Him in
   mystical but real union. "I am the true vine."

   1. And My Father is the vinedresser Now we know who is the true
   Guardian of the Church. Not the so-called "holy father" at Rome, but
   that Father above, who is the true Guardian, Ruler, Keeper, Preserver,
   Purifier, Vinedresser of the one Church, the vine!

   2. Every branch in Me that bears not fruit He takes away. There are
   many such branches, in Christ's visible Church which are not
   fruit-bearing branches and, consequently, are not partakers of the sap
   of life and Grace which flows into the branches that are vitally joined
   to the central stem. These fruitless branches are to be taken away.

   2. And every branch that bears fruit, He purges it, that it may bring
   forth more fruit There is some work, then, for the knife upon all the
   branches--cutting off for those that are fruitless--cutting for those
   that are bearing some fruit that they may bring forth yet more.

   3. Now you are clean [purged] through the word which I have spoken unto
   you. The Word is often the knife with which the great Vinedresser
   prunes the vine. And, Brothers and Sisters, if we were more willing to
   feel the edge of the Word, and to let it cut away even something that
   may be very dear to us, we would not need so much pruning by
   affliction. It is because that first knife does not always produce the
   desired result that another sharp tool is used by which we are
   effectually pruned.

   4. Abide in Me, and I in you.1 'Do not merely find a temporary shelter
   in Me, as a ship runs into harbor in stormy weather and then comes out
   again when the gale is over, but cast anchor in Me, as the vessel does
   when it reaches its desired haven. Be not as branches that are tied on
   and so can be taken off, but be livingly joined to Me. 'Abide in Me.'"

   4. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the
   vine; no more can you, except you abide in Me. You must bear fruit, or
   else be cast away, but you cannot bear any fruit except by real union
   and constant communion with Jesus Christ your Lord!

   5. I am the vine, you are the branches: he that abides in Me, and I in
   him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without Me you can do
   nothing. Not merely will you do very little, but you can do nothing at
   all if you are severed from Christ! You are absolutely and entirely
   dependent upon Christ, both for your life and for your fruit-bearing.
   Do we not wish to have it so, Beloved? It is the incipient principle of
   apostasy when a man wishes to be independent of Christ in any
   degree--when he says, "Give me the portion of goods that falls to me
   that I may have something in hand, some spending money of my own." No,
   you must, from day to day, from hour to hour and even from moment to
   moment, derive life, light, love, everything that is good from Christ!
   What a blessing that it is so!

   6. If a man abides not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
   withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
   are burned. There is a sad future in store for tares, according to
   another parable, but, somehow, there is a much sadder lot reserved for
   those that were, in some sense, branches of the vine--those who made a
   profession of faith in Christ, though they were never vitally united to
   Him. Those who, for a while, did rum well, yet were hindered. What was
   it that hindered them that they should not obey the Truth of God? Oh,
   it is sad, indeed, that any should have had any sort of connection with
   that Divine Stem and yet should be cast into the fire!

   7. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what
   you will, and it shall be done unto you. Do not think that all men can
   pray alike effectually, for it is not so. There are some whom God will
   hear and some whom God will not hear. And there are some even of His
   own children whom He will hear in things absolutely vital and
   essential, to whom He never gave carte blanche after this fashion. 'You
   shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you." No, if you
   will not hear God's words, He will not hear yours! And if His words do
   not abide in you, your words shall not have power with Him. They may be
   directed to Heaven, but the Lord will not listen to them so as to have
   regard to them. Oh, it needs very tender walking for one who would be
   mighty in prayer! You shall find that those who have had their will at
   the Throne of Grace are men who have done God's will in other
   places--it mast be so. The greatest favorite at court will have a
   double portion of the jealousy of his monarch, and he must be
   especially careful that he orders his steps aright, or else the king
   will not continue to favor him as he was known to do. There is a sacred
   discipline in Christ's house, a part of which consists in this, that,
   as our obedience to our God declines, so will our power in prayer
   decrease at the same time.

   8. Herein is My Father glorified, that he bearmuch fruit; so shallyou
   be My disciples. If we are His true disciples, we also shall bring
   forth much fruit.

"The Time of Jacob's Trouble"

   (No. 2645)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DRY, OCTOBER 22, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   29, 1882.

   "It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of
   it." Jeremiah 30:7.

   GOD here calls the Jews by the name of Jacob. These were His people in
   a very special sense, for He had chosen them from among all the nations
   of the earth and had brought them near Him that they might be His own
   portion, His inheritance. Yet upon these people He laid many stripes
   and visited them with sore chastisements. It is true that they were a
   sinful people, though they were, in many respects, better than other
   nations who were, for a long while, allowed to go unpunished. Year
   after year, the heathen prospered in war and had success in other
   ways--but as for God's own people, waters of a full cup were wrung out
   to them. As soon as the Lord had a people, they began to suffer. We
   learn this very early in their history, for, after Isaac, the child of
   promise, was born, it was not very long before Ishmael--"he that was
   born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit."

   And, as that persecution began early, it has continued late, for the
   Apostle adds, "Even so it is now." There is still an enmity between the
   seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman--and the seed of the
   woman is made to feel the serpent's malice so that, what with a
   chastising God and a biting serpent, the children of God are pretty
   sure to be often in trouble! And when, by Grace, you see them in their
   glittering ranks above, and ask, "Who are these which are arrayed in
   white robes, and from where did they come?" This will be the summary of
   the answer concerning them all, "These are they which came out of great
   tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb." "The sacramental host of God's elect," in its march
   through the world, may be tracked by its own blood! Read both ancient
   and modern history and what will you find but an account of the
   suffering and the triumphs of the people of God? Even to this day we
   have to cut a lane through the enemy and fight our way to Heaven in a
   stern hand-to-hand conflict. God has not yet prepared "flowery beds of
   ease" for any of us, nor shall we be "carried to the skies" in
   ambulances of luxury. We shall have to fight if we are to reign and we
   shall have to suffer if we are to ultimately reach the land of perfect
   blessedness!

   This is "the time of Jacob's trouble," even this day, this present
   life! Thank God it is but a day and will come to an end. But this is
   not the time of Jacob's joy. He does have some delights, even here, but
   his great joy is reserved for the hereafter. This is rather the time in
   which the sinner rejoices and fattens himself as for the slaughter. But
   God's people must expect to find that this is "the time of Jacob's
   trouble."

   But, dear Friends, the other Truth in our text is equally attested by
   history--"he shall be saved out of it." How gloriously God's people
   have been saved all along their line of march! Their campfires still
   show their trail and those camp-fires have been the burnings of the
   furnace that God has set up for the trying and purifying of His chosen
   people. But nowhere have they been destroyed, though everywhere they
   have been in affliction! They had a very narrow escape from destruction
   in Haman's day--the enemy then thought that he would utterly cut off
   the people of God from the face of the earth. Haman thought that he had
   managed everything so well that his wicked scheme had to succeed. The
   king's mandates had already gone out and on a certain day all the Jews
   would be put to death. But you know how Esther, at the peril of her
   life, went into the king's presence to plead for her nation and, soon,
   new edicts were sent out and the chosen people put their enemies to
   death! And they, themselves, were not destroyed.

   Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had fixed for Mordecai, for the
   hated Jew belonged to the seed which cannot be crushed, to the immortal
   race which can never die out! God's people may be often trodden down,
   like the grass of the field, but, as the grass springs up again and
   even outlive the men who tread upon it, so will it be with God's people
   even to the end! This is "the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be
   saved out of it." Christ's Church shall live and flourish when her
   persecutors lie in ignominious graves! Herod thought that he could
   crush the chosen seed, but he was eaten by worms--while the Church of
   God still lived on. The tyrant was soon swept away and so shall all be
   who lift their puny hands against the people of the Most High!

   It would be a very profitable subject, if one had the time to work it
   out, to see how true this verse is in relation to the Jewish people and
   to God's own elect ones. "It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but
   he shall be saved out of it." But I want at this time, to get at
   individuals. You know that God's Truth, in Scripture, is like a
   crystal. You may take a great mass of it and if you break that crystal
   into fragments, every little piece will be of the same form, for every
   division of the crystal is crystallized after the same fashion! In like
   manner, you can split God's Truth up so as to apply it to individuals,
   and then you can further divide it and apply it to each separate
   incident in the life of every man--and it will still hold good--for the
   Truth of God is always true and the faithful promise of God is
   applicable to every part of the Christian's life.

   I am going to speak to persons who are in trouble and I thought I would
   take up a series of trials as illustrated by the life of Jacob--not so
   much referring to his descendants, who are here called, Jacob, but
   speaking concerning Jacob, himself. He was a much-tried man and one
   reason for that was that he had a great deal in him that had to be
   driven out. And much of it could not be gotten out of him except with a
   severe shaking. Abraham, the father of the faithful, was a far grander
   man in every way. Isaac was of a calm and quiet spirit, but Jacob was
   naturally a worldly man. He is the father of the Jews, a business man,
   a scheming man, a man who is determined not to be overreached, but who
   is, perhaps, more likely to overreach others. Jacob was too much of a
   man until God broke him down--he certainly was a man of a very distinct
   type--and he has perpetuated that type in the whole Jewish nation to
   this day. I sometimes think that the Jews seem rather to have descended
   from Jacob than from Abraham, though, of course, they have really come
   from Abraham, throughJacob. I have already reminded you that Jacob was
   a man who had great trouble. There was a great deal of husk to that
   corn and, therefore, it needed a good deal of threshing.

   I. Now, looking at Jacob's career in detail, I note that he began his
   life as an individual apart from the family by a trial which must have
   been a very heavy one--HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER. It must
   have been especially painful to him to go away from his mother,
   Rebekah, who had had so much of the handling of him, so much of the
   making of him and, I must add, so much of the spoiling of him. And now,
   because he has treated his brother Esau unfairly and has robbed him of
   his blessing, coming before his father with a lie in his right hand, he
   must leave his home and go among strangers. Possibly I am addressing
   some who are now undergoing that experience. To leave home for the
   first time, whatever your age may be, is usually very painful. Some of
   us have known what it was to lie awake at night, when we had said
   good-bye to father and mother and were far away from them. Some of you
   have, perhaps, crossed the sea and left dear ones behind--that first
   night on board ship, away from all you loved--you sobbed yourself to
   sleep. These changes must come. We cannot always live in the family
   nest--we must go out of it and make nests of our own. But when the
   parting comes, it is often a hard task--not to coarse, rough
   natures--but then I do not suppose such people are here. Gentle, kind,
   delicate souls--these are they who most feel the separation from those
   who are dear to them!

   In Jacob's case there was a bitter ingredient which I hope is absent
   from yours. The separation came very much as the result of his own
   fault and his mother's fault. They must have felt it very keenly when
   they were caused to part from one another. Their scheming had won the
   blessing away from Esau, but now they had the shady side of the
   blessing--and the shady side of a blessing is, for a while, not
   materially different from a curse. Yet, by-and-by, that very shady side
   becomes a marvelous blessing to the soul! When Jacob started off alone
   upon his weary way, he journeyed on till, at night, he lighted upon a
   certain place and took of the stones of that place for his pillow, for
   that was "the time of Jacob's trouble." But, ah, dear Friends, how
   sweet was the second part of our text to him! May it be equally
   precious to you--"but he shall be saved out of it."

   He lies down to sleep and he is saved out of his troubles as soon as he
   has fallen asleep, for, in his dream, he sees a mystic ladder, the foot
   of which is on earth, but the top reaches to Heaven--a marvelous vision
   of that way by which we shall ascend to God--the Lord, Himself, having
   first come down to us in the Person of His dear Son. It was worth while
   being away from home and having such lodgings as that--to have such a
   dream! Jacob did not mind the cold and heavy night dews, for there was
   a dew from the Lord that refreshed his spirit! It mattered little to
   him that the beasts of prey might be round about him, for the angels of
   God were ascending and descending between him and the Throne of the
   Infinite One! Let it be the same with you, also, dear Friend. If it is
   with you, "the time of Jacob's trouble" because you are separated from
   those you love, now get into all the closer union with your God! Now
   begin to use that ladder, that wondrous means of communication between
   your immortal spirit and the immortal God! Through Christ Jesus, look
   up to your Father who is in Heaven--carry on a sacred commerce between
   your soul and the heavenly world and seek to be spiritually enriched
   thereby!

   It would be a blessed thing if you were no longer able to rely upon an
   arm of flesh, that you might be obliged to come and rest upon the
   unseen arm of God. It shall be a gainful loss to you to have lost your
   mother's care, but to have come nearer to the Most High! I grieve,
   sometimes, when I see how God's people manage to live a great way off
   from Him and yet appear to be quite comfortable, and to have all that
   they could wish. But I am glad when any one of them is thrust right out
   of all harmful associations and so is drawn nearer to God, for when God
   says, "Come you out from among them, and be you separate," if we do not
   at once obey His command, He has many ways of making us come out and it
   may be that we have to come out in a fashion that is exceedingly
   painful. Yet, however trying it is, it matters little if we but get
   nearer to Him! We may even sing--

   "Nearer, my God, to Thee--

   Nearer to Thee!

   Even though it be a cross

   That raises me,

   Still all my song shall be,

   'Nearer, my God, to Thee --

   Nearer to Thee!'"

   Dear young Friend, you who are just now all alone, in trouble and have
   come in here in the hope of receiving some comforting message, I trust
   that God has meant this part of the sermon to be a word especially for
   you.

   II. Jacob's next trouble was that HE GOT TO HIS UNCLE LABAN.
   "Laban"--read his name backwards and it is "Naball" There was not a
   great deal of difference between the two men, for they were both of a
   churlish disposition. La-ban was a hard, grinding taskmaster to Jacob.
   He cheated him whenever he could, robbed him in all manner of ways,
   changed his wages when he thought his remuneration was too large,
   while, by night, the cold devoured the poor shep-herd--and by day, the
   heat was most trying. Yet Laban never had such a faithful servant as
   his nephew Jacob--and God blessed Laban for Jacob's sake. I really
   think that I may say of that period in the Patriarch's life, "This is
   the time of Jacob's trouble," for it is a very hard thing to work for
   an unthankful master and, after all your trouble and pains, to get no
   word of gratitude or love. Laban ought to have loved Jacob, for he was
   both his nephew and his son-in-law. Jacob's wives were the daughters of
   Laban and their father ought to have been kindly disposed towards him.
   But both the father and the sons seem to have treated him rather as an
   enemy than as a friend and so he had hard times all the while he was
   with them. Perhaps some of you are saying, "Ah, Sir, you do not know my
   circumstances! Mine is hard and grinding labor. I am bowed down by it
   and I seem to have no sympathy whatever, even from those who ought to
   be kind to me." Well, dear Friend, Jacob, you see, went that way, and
   you may be content to endure, for a while, the same lot as that eminent
   Patriarch. But, truly, it is a bitter grief and I can understand your
   saying, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
   of Kedar!" "Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then I would fly away
   and be at rest."

   Now listen to the second half of our text and believe that as it came
   true to Jacob, it shall also come true to you--"It is even the time of
   Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it." And he was saved out
   of it! He might have never left Padanaram if he had not been forced out
   of it--and it was his duty to get back, as soon as he could, into the
   promised land--and there live the separated life. The very hardness of
   the burdens that were put upon him weaned him from the house of Laban
   and made him willing to bear the hardships of a wandering life--which
   must have seemed little compared with those which he endured with
   churlish Laban. My dear tried Friend, God is working out some great end
   for you through your troubles! It is good for young people to bear a
   certain amount of burden--not that this excuses those who oppress them
   and exact more than is right from them, but, "it is good for a man that
   he bears the yoke in his youth."

   I believe that the drinking out of the bitter cup early in life is
   often followed by a long stretch of peaceful rest, besides teaching us
   many a useful lesson which, otherwise, we might never have learned!

   You would like to have all things arranged according to your own
   wishes, would you not? And then you would grow up and be like a bull
   unaccustomed to the yoke! But that is not God's method. You have to be
   tamed and trained while you are young--you have to bear the yoke and,
   oftentimes, you may cry to God because it seems to gall your unwilling
   shoulders. But then, in later years, you will be of a tender spirit,
   yourself, and so you will be the more ready and able to sympathize with
   those who are down-trodden and persecuted. And you will often have to
   bless God for those early afflictions which taught you wisdom and
   fitted you to be the helper of others. Be always more earnest to do
   your duty than to be at ease. Be more concerned to be right than to be
   happy! Be more determined to act uprightly than to secure the rewards
   of your work. God will lay them up in store for you and you shall have
   them in due season. Bear, and forbear, and still bear--remember how the
   saints of God have often had to endure harsh usage from those who ought
   to have loved them--and be content to bear the cross which they carried
   before you.

   III. Now I must pass on to notice Jacob's next trouble. He has got away
   from Laban and he starts off with his family and his flocks and herds.
   Now HE REMEMBERS HIS BROTHER ESAU whom he had treated so badly and,
   behold,

   Esau is coming to meet him with 400 armed men! Now, if it were "the
   time of Jacob's trouble" when he was under La-ban's power, surely this
   is even worse than any trial that went before, for will not Esau come
   with his armed men and smite Jacob and destroy the mothers and the
   children? Is he not full of wrath against him for what he did long ago?
   And has he not just causefor that wrath?

   This is, indeed, "the time of Jacob's trouble." He sends all that
   belong to him across the brook and he spends the night in prayer--not
   sweet and tranquil prayer such as is our privilege to often enjoy, but
   we read, "There wrestled a Man with him until the breaking of the day."
   We generally lay the stress upon the thought that Jacob wrestled with
   the Angel. No doubt he did, but the Bible does not say so--it says,
   "There wrestled a Man with him." There was a great deal in Jacob that
   needed to come out and this Angel came and wrestled with him in order
   to get it out! And Jacob's victory was not won until the Angel had
   touched the hollow of his thigh so that he should always need to lean
   upon a staff even till he died. His weakness had been proven and he had
   been overcome--and then it was that heovercame and became a prevailing
   prince, having power with God and with men!

   But, oh, that was a dark night for Jacob! Try to put yourselves into
   his position, when, even in his prayers, he was disturbed, "and there
   wrestled a Man with him until the breaking of the day." His heart,
   surely, must have been ready to break within him, yet the whole of our
   text is true of that memorable night, "This is the time of Jacob's
   trouble; but he shall be saved out of it." And was he not? Ah, yes, and
   the joys of Peniel shall always exceed the sorrow with which the
   wrestling of Peniel is commenced! When he went, limping upon his thigh,
   to join his family, his grief was gone and his fear was removed. God
   had appeared to him, so all would be well, all was safe, all must be
   right, for God had heard his cry and he had obtained the blessing!

   He was delivered out of his trouble, but how strangely it came about!
   When Esau came, he was full of love. Instead of war being in his heart,
   sweet words were upon his lips! If he had not altogether forgiven
   Jacob, yet, at any rate, he was willing to say nothing about the past
   and he spoke like a true and noble brother! This is a Truth of God
   which we often forget--that God has absolute power over men's hearts.
   You say that somebody is going to betray you--that is more than he can
   do unless God letshim. Somebody threatens to do a very dreadful thing
   to you and you feel that you are quite in his power. Yes, but so is
   that man quite in God'spower--and God can turn him whichever way He
   likes! You are afraid to meet him, you say. Well, just pluck up your
   courage and go to him--and you shall, perhaps, find that he is now your
   friend--the very person that you have looked upon as your worst enemy!
   This has frequently happened. God, who struck down Saul of Tarsus when
   he was about to destroy the saints at Damascus, is quite as able to
   strike down the most violent person when he is about to do mischief to
   any of His children. Never mind about Esau--be more concerned to give
   up what the Angel intends to wrestle out of you and to hold Him fast,
   and say, "I will not let You go, except You bless me." God will speak
   to Esau and He will take care of you and you shall yet go on your way
   rejoicing!

   IV. Jacob goes on till he gets to Succoth and he is so pleased to be
   quiet, and at rest, that HE SEEMS TO FORGET HIS GOD, for he builds a
   house for himself and booths for his cattle, and does not continue to
   live the wandering life that he should! Therefore God soon sends him a
   trouble. His sons, in the most brutal manner, destroy the men of
   Shechem, taking them at unawares and murdering them, so that Jacob's
   name was made to stink, as he said, among all the tribes. And any oneof
   those tribes was quite able to come and destroy him--but if they had
   banded together, they would have swept him and his family off the face
   of the earth! Jacob is very much afraid concerning this and now, I
   think, when he is going into the midst of the Canaanites and all the
   inhabitants of the land are justly indignant against his sons, we may
   again say, "This is the time of Jacob's trouble.'" It is a trouble and
   no mistake about it. There might be some senti-mentalism about his
   sorrowing on leaving home. There might be some compensation for his
   hard treatment by Laban. We may suppose that there was too much
   suspicion of Esau in his third trouble--but now this is a real
   trial--"I shall be destroyed, I and my house."

   "It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of
   it." And, oh, how wonderfully was he saved out of it, for the Lord put
   a fear on all the people round about! He seemed to say to them, "Touch
   not My anointed" and, though willing enough to fall upon Jacob, and to
   slay his wives and children, and take his property, they left them all
   alone! It is truly marvelous how God can make our enemies to be at
   peace with us! There are more people than Daniel who have slept in the
   lions' den--yes, and found soft pillows on the lions' manes and slept
   soundly among them! "My God has sent His angel, and has shut the lions'
   mouths, that they have not hurt me," said Daniel, and often have others
   of God's servants felt that they have been delivered in the same way! I
   remember a poor man who used to preach and who, in a sermon, once gave
   a description of Daniel in the lions' den. He said, "I do not think the
   painters make the lions look as fierce as they really were. In most of
   the pictures, they look as if they could not possibly have eaten
   Daniel, they are so meek and mild, as if they had padlocks on their
   jaws. But they were real lions and hungry lions, too, as was proved by
   the way in which they ate up Daniel's enemies." He said he believed
   that when Daniel was thrown into the den, they all came rushing towards
   him to devour him, but an angel flew down from Heaven and said to them,
   "Hush!" And they all lay as still as possible at the Prophet's feet.

   No doubt it was something like that and, sometimes, when the enemies of
   God's people are most infuriated, He seems to say to them, "Hush!" and
   they cannot touch them. Why did the Romanists not burn Luther? I never
   could make that out. If I had been the Pope, I think I would have got
   rid of him someway or other. Yet nobody could touch Luther! They made
   short work of John Huss and Jerome of Prague, but, even when the
   princes and prelates had Luther before them at the Diet of Worms, they
   did not destroy him! It could not be, for God meant that Luther should
   die in his bed, notwithstanding all the rage of the enemy! Therefore,
   if it is a time of trouble with us, let us rest and be quiet, for
   surely we shall be saved out of it.

   V. Was this the end of Jacob's troubles? Oh, dear, no! All his life he
   must have troubles of one sort or another. HE HAS A DEAR SON WHOM HE
   FAVORS and he has made a coat of many colors for him, such as young
   princes wear. This young man is different from all his brothers. He has
   a gentle spiritual nature. God has spoken to him and worked upon him
   most graciously. The Lord is evidently with him and his father's heart
   goes out to the young dreamer and he dotes upon him. You know the story
   of how his brothers, after a while, bring Joseph's coat dipped in sheep
   blood and hold it up before the poor old father. And they say, "This we
   have found: know now whether it is your son's coat or not." Oh,
   this--this is "the time of Jacob's trouble"!

   All those other troubles are nothing at all compared with this one
   which will surely break the old man's heart! Joseph! Dear Joseph, worth
   more than all the others, is taken away, "an evil beast has devoured
   him. Joseph is, without doubt, torn in pieces." Jacob will go to his
   grave sorrowing because his beloved Joseph is taken away from him. Now
   shout it to the ends of the earth--"This is the time of Jacob's
   trouble!" If any of you have had a favorite child and you have allowed
   all the tendrils of your heart to entwine themselves about it. And if
   that child is suddenly taken away, it leaves a mark upon the heart that
   will never be erased in time. I have known the father, if he has been
   an ungodly man, become rebellious against God from that time
   forth--there is a bitterness infused into his unbelief that was never
   there before. But even a gracious man has gone sorrowfully and sadly
   all his days after some dear child has been taken away--a child of so
   much promise--a child who was so gracious and who seemed to be such a
   help to the father, and likely to lift the family up to a better
   condition of things. Yet, Joseph is gone, and this is "the time of
   Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it."

   And was he not? It took a long time for him to see it, but when he wept
   on Joseph's neck and when he saw him as the second ruler over all the
   land of Egypt--and when Joseph came down to him and brought his two
   sons, and Jacob said,

   "I had not thought to see your face: and, lo, God has showed me, also,
   your seed"--then did he know that God had delivered him out of his
   trouble and multiplied the blessing exceedingly abundantly above what
   he asked or even thought!

   Now, dear Friends, if this is your case, be satisfied about the dear
   child whom the Lord has called Home to Himself. "Ah," you say, "there
   is no mistake about it. I know that my child is dead." Yes, but I also
   know that your child is alive! Come, shall we quarrel over it? You say
   that he is dead--I say that he lives. God knows that that dear one,
   taken away in infancy, or taken away as a gracious child, lives! Did
   you ever notice that passage which says that God gave Job twice as much
   as he had before? "Yes," you say, "but He did not give him twice as
   many children, did He? He gave him exactly the same number again, did
   He not? Then how did He give him twice as much as he had before?" Why,
   because those first ones that were dead were still his! You know how
   Wordsworth puts it, "We are seven." Though some were gone, yet they
   were still seven--and Job counted all those that were gone as his--and
   then, with the others, he didhave twice the number in his family than
   he had before!

   So, Beloved, count your dear ones as though they were still with you,
   and wait patiently till you meet them again. Refrain from undue
   weeping, for they shall come again from the land of their captivity.
   Your dead ones shall live again! Mother of mortals, you did well to
   weep, but your children live, so you are the mother of immortals Then
   why do you sorrow? Dry your eyes and bless God that you have another
   link with Heaven and that you have helped to fill the choirs that, day
   without night, circle the Throne of God with hallelujahs!

   VI. Is Jacob through with his troubles yet? No, no, no! He has got out
   of one trouble, but he has got into another--

   "A Christian man is never long at ease--

   When one trouble's gone, another does him seize," which, if it is not
   good poetry, was written by John Bunyan, and is good sound truth!
   JACOB'S NEXT TIME OF TROUBLE AROSE THROUGH A FAMINE IN THE LAND. The
   death of Joseph, as his father thought, seemed a dreadful thing, but a
   famine of bread that will kill the whole family is a great deal worse
   trouble! There is nothing to eat, so what will become of them? There is
   corn in Egypt, however, and the good old man sends his sons down there
   to buy food. And on the back of that comes another trouble, for when
   they return home, they say that the lord of the land will not let them
   have any more corn unless they take Benjamin back with them. But Jacob
   cannot spare Benjamin and, depend upon it, this is the last ounce that
   will break the camel's back! Says the old man, "Joseph is not, and
   Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away? All these things are
   against me." This, this has to be "the time of Jacob's trouble."
   Surely, he is now in the very depths of it! But Benjamin must go,
   notwithstanding all that his father may say. Jacob must part with his
   last idol and God will make us part with our last idols, too. Therefore
   mind what you set up in your house as idols, for it is written, "The
   idols He shall utterly abolish."

   That was "the time of Jacob's trouble," but the Lord delivered him out
   of it! You need not that I should stay to tell you how sweetly the Lord
   was working on Jacob's behalf all the while. Joseph was in Egypt to
   keep the whole family alive in the time of famine. Benjamin came back
   all right and they all went down into Egypt and sojourned there. And
   just as surely as Jacob was delivered, so shall you be. When the worst
   comes to the worst, then the best of the best will come. When the whole
   store of bread seems gone, then shall you find this promise true,
   "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure."

   VII. Well, that is the end of Jacob's trouble unless I add what I
   hardly think I dare call a trouble. JACOB HAD TO

   GATHER UP HIS FEET IN BED AND DIE. I do not think that it was a trouble
   to him. The few and evil days of his pilgrimage were now over and he
   was to meet his fathers, and his fathers' God. Yet still, it matters
   not who we are, if we look only at the earthlyside of death, it isa
   trouble to die. No one can go down into the disembodied state without
   having some sort of fear. The immortal tenant, however badly lodged,
   still seems to love the house of clay. But whether it was a trouble to
   Jacob, or not, certainly he was saved out of it. He dies with
   benedictions on his lips and he falls asleep to awake in Glory and
   there to sit down with Abraham and Isaac at the feast of everlasting
   blessedness! It was well with Jacob and it shall be well with you who
   believe in Jesus! You, also, shall say, "I have waited for Your
   salvation, O Lord." And that salvation will come at exactlythe right
   time! You have tarried till the fourscore years are ended. You are
   getting somewhat weary amidst the toil and infirmities of a body that
   is inclining to the tomb. Be of good courage! To such as you are--

   "It is not death to die."

   If you are in Christ, you shall fall asleep in Him and then you shall
   be "forever with the Lord."

   But perhaps there is some poor soul here saying, "I have not got any
   comfort out of the sermon because all my trouble is about my sin. I
   have not lost a child. I am not suffering through a famine. My great
   sorrow is concerning my sin, my sin, my sin! It haunts me. It eats like
   a canker into my spirit. It withers all my joys. It turns my life
   almost into a Hell." I know where you are, dear Friend, for I have been
   that way myself. "This is the time of Jacob's trouble." There is no
   trouble like genuine conviction of sin! Racks, scorpions, death--these
   are troubles to be laughed at compared with the weight of guilt
   pressing on the conscience, the sight of an angry God and the fear of
   the wrath to come! "This is the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall
   be saved out of it." The Lord Jesus Christ has come to save just such
   as you are! To you He extends His pierced hand. He waits to receive you
   just as you are. Look to Him! Look to Him! Look to Him, you lost and
   ruined! Look and live, for in a look at Him there is life for you! Your
   trouble is great, but you shall be saved out of it though your sins
   were more numerous than the stars and each one more weighty than the
   world! Do but look to Him--take your eyes off yourself and fully gaze
   on Him who bore your sins in His own body on the Cross!

   Do you trust Him? Then you are saved! Your sin is gone--it is buried in
   His sepulcher. God has forgiven you all your transgressions for Jesus'
   sake! Go on your way rejoicing! "This is the time of Jacob's trouble;
   but he shall be saved out of it." God bless you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM31.

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   This Psalm was meant to be sung, therefore it was dedicated to the
   chief musician. Yet it is a Psalm of which at least half is very
   sorrowful. All our hymns were not meant to be joyous ones. God permits
   us to take a wide range in our Psalmody and to express the feelings of
   our heart whatever they may be. You will see here and there the Light
   of Christ shining on this Psalm. If it does not shine on Him, at any
   rate He shines on it.

   Verse 1. In You, O LORD, do I put my trust. Is that true of you, dear
   Friends? Never take your trust upon trust, but be quite sure that you
   trust in God. If it is so, acknowledge it and never be ashamed to say,
   "In You, O Lord, do I put my trust."

   1-3. Let me never be ashamed: deliver me in Your righteousness. Bow
   down Your ear to me; deliver me speedily: be You my strong rock for an
   house of defense to save me. For You are my rock and my fortress;
   therefore for Your name's sake lead me, and guide me. See how logical
   David is with his, "for," and, "therefore"? It is the very essence of
   prayer to be able to urge pleas with God and to say to Him, "Do it for
   this reason," or, "Therefore, do it for such another reason." I would
   that we, all of us, studied more fully this blessed art of pleading
   with God--bringing forth sound arguments as we approach Him.

   4. Pull me out of the net that they have laid privately for me: for You
   are my strength. How sweetly and blessedly he pleads! "'You are my
   strength.' I cannot get out of this net, I am entangled in it, but You
   can pull me out, for, 'You are my strength.'"

   5. Into Your hands I commit my spirit: You have redeemed me, O LORD God
   of Truth. This is a blessed prayer--a holy resolution which we may use
   every day in the week all through our lives.

   6. I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
   LORD. "In Jehovah." David had no patience with those who trusted in
   gods of wood and stone. He knew very little, indeed, of that spurious
   charity which leads some men to speak respectfully even of idolatry!
   David was "a good hater" and there is something gracious about that
   when the thing hated is really hateful and something which ought to be
   hated!

   7. I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy. David makes the cymbals
   clash together--"I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy."

   7. For You have considered my trouble; You have known my soul in
   adversities. I t is said to be the highest wisdom to know yourself,
   but, to my mind, it is a much better thing for God to know you! You may
   know yourself and fall into despair--but if God knows you and you know
   God, there is abundant room for you to hope in His mercy.

   8, And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: You have set my
   feet in a large room. "You have given me a broad place to live and You
   have given me abundance to eat there." So David praises and blesses his
   God. But now see how the note falls. From the highest point of the
   scale, he suddenly descends to the very lowest. "We spend our years as
   a tale that is told"--and such a tale is sometimes very joyful--but
   sometimes it is full of woe.

   9, 10. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: my eyes are
   consumed with grief, yes, my soul and my belly. For my life is spent
   with grief and my years with sighing. Sighing is better than sinning,
   any day. Though we may deplore that our life melts away in sighs, it is
   better that it should go so than that it should be wasted in sins.

   10, 11. My strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are
   consumed. I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among
   my neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintance: they that did see me
   outside fled from me. He was in such a sorry plight that men would not
   acknowledge him! They were afraid that they should be disgraced by
   being found in his company! It is a sad condition for a man of God,
   like David, to be found in--for others to be afraid to be seen speaking
   to him.

   12, I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
   vessel. An old pot, flung on the dunghill, as of no further use.

   13, 14. For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: a
   while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away
   my life. But I trusted in You, O LORD. Now the strain will mount again!
   It is faith that tunes the royal singer so that he rises to heights
   ofjoy though just now he had sunk so low!

   14, 15. I said, You are my God. My times are in Your hands. He had put
   his spirit there--"Into Your hands I commit my spirit." And now he
   says, "My times are in Your hands."

   15-19. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from them that
   persecute me. Make Your face to shine upon Your servant: save me for
   Your mercies' sake. Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called
   upon You: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
   grave. Let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things
   proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. Oh how great is Your
   goodness, which You have laid up for them that fear You. If he was not
   tasting of it, just then, he blessed God that it was laid up for him,
   put by in store.

   19, 20. Which You have worked for them that trust in You before the
   sons of men! You shall hide them in the secret of Your Presence from
   the pride of man: You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
   strife of tongues. What a blessing that is--to be separated from the
   noise and strife and the malignant calumny of wicked men! God has a
   blessed way of keeping His servants away from all such evils.

   21, 22. Blessed be the LORD: for He has showed me His marvelous
   kindness in a strong city. For I said in my haste, I am cut off from
   before Your eyes: nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications
   when I cried unto You. "If we believe not, yet He abides faithful: He
   cannot deny Himself." The Psalmist was full of doubts and he said, "I
   am cut off," but, nevertheless, God heard the prayer of His poor
   mistrusting servant and brought him out of his distresses!

   23, 24. Olove the LORD, allyou His saints: for the LORD preserves the
   faithful, and plentifully rewards theproud doer. Be of good courage,
   and He shall strengthen your heart, allyou that hope in the LORD.

The Baptist's Message

   (No. 2646)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 29, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   2, 1882.

   "The next day John saw Jesus cooing toward him and said, Behold the
   Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" John 1:29.

   JOHN was the herald of Christ. He came to bear witness to Him and to
   prepare the way for Him. In olden times when kings traveled, they were
   accustomed to send heralds before them to announce their coming, and to
   prepare the way for them. And I have read that on several occasions the
   herald wore such gorgeous apparel--adorned with gold and lace--that
   when he went into some of the towns and villages, the people thought
   that he must be the king, himself! So they made ready to receive him
   with royal honors. When he said, "No, I am not the king, I have merely
   come to sound the trumpet and to say that he is coming," they wondered
   what the king, himself, must be like if his herald was so
   resplendent--and it is said that in several instances they refused to
   receive the king when he came, for they said, "The man who told us that
   he was only your servant was a far finer looking man than you are, and
   much more grandly dressed." So, when the king arrived and they saw that
   he was but plainly dressed, as kings usually are when not wearing their
   state robes, they would not receive him.

   Something like that happens with some of Christ's heralds, but it did
   not occur in the case of John the Baptist. He was not arrayed in soft
   raiment or rich apparel. He came straight up from the wilderness
   clothed in a garment of camel's hair and with leather trousers about
   his loins--and his food was locusts and wild honey. Nor was there
   anything at all about John's mode of speech which was likely to attract
   attention to himself and make men think less of his Master when He
   should come. I wish that all of us, when we go forth as Christ's
   heralds, crying, "Behold the Lamb of God"--and that is our main
   business here below--would take care that we were never so grand in our
   style of thought or language that when the Master, Himself, comes in
   all His wondrous simplicity, men would begin to despise Him because
   they remembered the fine tones of His pretended herald! No, let us be
   simple and plain whenever we have to speak of Christ and when our King,
   Himself, comes, let us step back and get out of sight, that He, alone,
   may be seen, and that all the people's hearts may be won to Him.

   I have plunged into the middle of my subject at the very beginning of
   my sermon, for that is the theme on which I want to speak to you.
   First, I am going to describe the true messenger, John the Baptist, or
   anyone else who is like he. Then, secondly, I hope to talk about the
   true message--"Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
   world." And then, thirdly, I must say a little upon the true reception
   of this message, telling what they do who really hear and believe the
   true messenger of God.

   I. First, then, let us think of THE TRUE MESSENGER and, as I know that
   there are many here who try to do good by speaking for the Lord to
   their fellow men, let this first part of my subject be a lesson in
   self-examination--not by way of discouragement, but rather of
   encouragement, I hope, to those whom I am addressing. Who are they who
   will be acknowledged by Christ, at the Last Great Day, as the true
   messengers of God? What are the special characteristics by which they
   may be known?

   Well, first, the true messenger is one who sees the Lord Jesus for
   himself'"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him." To be His
   herald and witness, John must see Jesus and he must see Jesus coming to
   him. Those Prophets who lived a long while before the coming of Christ
   were but dim seers compared with John the Baptist. He was like the
   morning star which is so near the sun that it is the brightest of the
   stars. We see it shining almost like a little sun and then, when the
   sun rises in all its brightness, the star disappears. John was "a
   burning and a shining light" and all who came before him were, in
   Christ's judgment, inferior to him. He said to the multitudes
   concerning John, "What did you go out to see? A Prophet? Yes, I say to
   you, and more than a Prophet. For this is he, of whom it is written,
   Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your
   way before You. Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of
   women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist." This was
   the difference between John and the Prophets-- his sight of Christ was
   clearer than theirs because he was nearer to Christ. And his view of
   Christ was brighter, fuller and clearer than that of all who had gone
   before.

   Yet they were also true witnesses to Christ, according to the light
   they had. Our Savior said to the Jews, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to
   see My day: he saw it and was glad." And if he had not seen Christ by
   faith, he could not have been one of the witnesses who testified
   beforehand concerning Him. All the Prophets looked through the haze of
   the ages and, by faith, perceived their Lord. And then they wrote of
   Him and spoke of Him to the people. The ancient name for a Prophet was
   a very instructive one--he was called a seer--and you and I, Beloved,
   must see Christ or else we cannot bear witness to Him. As the Prophets
   saw Christ by faith and as John actually looked upon Him and then bore
   witness to Him, so must you and I see Him. Not with these eyes--that
   sight is reserved until the Resurrection--but with the eyes of our
   spirit, with the eyes of our mind and heart we must see Jesus before we
   can rightly speak of Him.

   Are you anxious, my Brother, to go and preach? Have you seen Jesus? If
   not, what can you say when people ask you, "What is He like? Who is He
   that we should believe in Him?" You must look unto Him before you can
   speak of Him and, the more steadfastly you gaze upon Him, His work, His
   offices, His humiliation, His glorification, the better will you be
   able to bear your witness concerning Him. You will then speak more
   surely and confidently for your God if you can testify concerning that
   which your heart knows to be true because you have perceived and
   enjoyed it yourself!

   Yes, and if you have seen Him in the past, try to see Him, again, and
   to be continually "looking unto Jesus." Let not any of us go and talk
   to our Sunday school class, or preach from the pulpit, or write a
   letter about our Lord until we have had a fresh glimpse of Him. It is
   wonderful how nimbly the pen or the tongue moves when the eye has just
   feasted itself upon Christ! The Psalmist said, "My heart is overflowing
   with a good theme: I speak of the things which I have made touching the
   king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer." When you have, yourself,
   been with Christ. When you have just come forth from the ivory palaces
   of communion and fellowship with the Lord Jesus, all your garments will
   smell of myrrh, aloes and cassia! And your words will have some of the
   precious savor clinging to them. So again I say that we must see Christ
   or else we cannot be witnesses to Him.

   And, therefore, let us fix our hearts, our thoughts and our meditations
   so completely upon Christ that when we cry to other men, "Behold the
   Lamb of God," it will be because we have just beheld Him ourselves! If
   a man who is blind were to stand up in the street and cry, "Behold,"
   people would be apt to ask, "What can a poor blind man bid us look at?
   He cannot see anything himself." If you say to the people, "Behold
   Christ," yet all the while your eyes are turned toward yourselfand you
   are wondering whether you will get through the sermon all
   right--whether you will have a fine conclusion at the end and what the
   congregation will think of it when you have done--that will be like
   saying, "Behold!" while you, yourself, are looking the other way! And
   other people will look in the same direction! They will be sure to do
   as you do and not as you say. And if you do not behold Christ, neither
   will they! Our inward thought, conviction and belief must be in strict
   accordance with our outward speech, or else we shall misrepresent
   ourselves--and our message will be poorly delivered and will fall
   without power upon our hearers.

   I also remind you that we must preach Christ as coming. "Why," says
   one, "He hascome!" I know that He has, but He is coming again. It is a
   blessed thing that, whereas the Prophets saw Him as coming, they only
   differed from us in this respect--that we can look back to His first
   coming, as they looked forward to it. And we can also look onward to
   His coming a second time, "without sin unto salvation"--and so we are
   to speak of Him as coming. It is grand preaching when the preacher can
   see Christ coming, when he can behold the Throne of Judgment set and
   can gaze upon the King in His beauty sitting upon it, and see Him
   reigning over all, King of Kings and Lord of Lords! It is glorious when
   he hears the hallelujahs of the approaching millennial age even while
   he is preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ! "Lo, He comes," he says,
   and he sees Him coming, for he is not like the virgins who had fallen
   asleep and so did not watch for the bridegroom's appearing. Oh, for
   open eyes, expectant hearts and earnest tongues to see, and long for,
   and tell of our coming Lord! This is the way the faithful witness
   preaches Him to the people.

   But, next, the true messenger calls upon men to see Jesus. He calls
   them away from seeing other things and bids them look, and, "behold the
   Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" God-sent servants do
   not say, "Look to the priest! Look to the altar! Look to the
   sacraments! Look to yourself--come and confess your sins and I will
   give you absolution!" No, no, no, no! Forever and forever NO! They do
   nothing of that sort. The priests of Antichrist do that, but the
   servants of Christ cry, "Behold the Lamb of God." Our great difficulty
   is to get men's eyes off themselves, off their works, off their forms
   and ceremonies, off mere creed-religion and to get them to look at the
   living Christ who is still among us bearing the sin of all who truly
   seek His face!

   O dear Hearers, I know that I am, in this respect, a faithful witness.
   Wherever else I fail in my testimony, for my soul's labor and travail,
   even unto anguish, is to get you away from depending even in the
   slightest degree upon anything else but what Christ has done! I would
   not wish you to have the shadow of a shade of a ghost of a pretense of
   a confidence anywhere out of Christ! Jesus is the only hope of sinners!
   Let Him be A to you, and Z, and all the letters between--the beginning
   and the end--and the middle and everything else! Take your eyes off all
   ministers, all books, all feelings and even all believing! Do not even
   fix your gaze on your own faith. You know that the eye cannot see
   itself. Did you ever see your own eye? In a mirror, perhaps, you may
   have done so, but that was only the reflection of it and you may, in
   like manner, see the evidence of your faith, but you cannot look at the
   faith itself. Faith looks away from itself to the Object of faith, even
   to Christ! And this is what the true witness desires. He will, if he
   can, keep men from looking anywhere but on his Master!

   Some look at their repentance, but if you cannot keep your eyes on
   Christ, then away with your repentance! Some are always looking to
   their faith, but if there is a faith that hides Christ, away with it!
   Some need feelings and right feelings we may wish to have--but as for
   those feelings which come between us and Christ, away with them! It is
   not fit that they should live. Our one business is to get men away from
   anything and from everything, however good it is, that they may look
   alone to Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God!

   The third mark of a true witness is that he leads his own disciples to
   Jesus. It is generally thought to be a good thing to lead another man's
   disciples beyond their master, but it is not always so easy to lead our
   own disciples beyond ourselves. The preacher is often conscious that
   there are many weak persons who stop short at what he says. To them it
   is a great help to faith that their pastor or their minister says
   such-and-such. Well, for lame people, we do not object to crutches for
   a time, but we always anxiously pray that the faith of these poor
   cripples may not stand--at least, for any length of time--in the power
   of man, but in Christ alone! I would say to you what the Apostle Paul
   wrote to the Gala-tians, though I wish I could say something that would
   be worthy to be placed beneath what he said, and so be more suitable
   for one so much inferior to him. He says, "Though we, or an angel from
   Heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have
   preached unto you, let him be accursed." That is, "Let us, ourselves,
   be accursed if we ever dare to lead you away from Christ. It is an
   imprecation upon our own souls if we dare to make ourselves your
   masters instead of your servantsfor Jesus' sake!"

   It was a beautiful trait in the character of John the Baptist that he
   was so ready to pass on to Christ his own disciples--he did not want to
   keep them merely to swell the number of his own followers, but only
   kept them with him until he could point them to his Master. When we try
   to win souls, if we find that people have confidence in us and
   affection for us, let us use that influence not to attach them to
   ourselves except with the earnest desire to pass them on to
   Christ--that they may become disciples of the Savior for themselves and
   grow up from being babes who have to be nursed to become strong men in
   Christ Jesus.

   One more thing about John the Baptist which is also a characteristic of
   the true witness for Christ is that he lost himself in his Master
   Without a single atom of regret he said, "He must increase, but I must
   decrease." Oh, how grandly he witnessed for Christ by sinking himself
   until he was lost in Christ! And my Brother, it must be the same with
   you--if you would be a true witness for Christ, you must say that which
   glorifies Him, even though it dishonors yourself! Perhaps there is a
   very learned man sitting over yonder and the temptation to the preacher
   is to say something that shall make him feel that the minister to whom
   he is listening is not so ignorant as some people suppose. But if there
   is an unlearned, simple sinner anywhere in the place, the preacher's
   business is just to chop his words down to that poor man's condition
   and let the learned hearer receive the same message if he will!

   Luther said, "When I am preaching, I see Dr. Jonas sitting there, and
   Oecolampadius, and Melanchthon and I say to myself, 'Those learned
   doctors know enough already, so I need not trouble about them. I shall
   fire at the poor people in the aisles.'" That is the way Luther
   preached and God richly blessed his ministry because he did it. Though
   he was a truly learned man, he was willing to be reckoned as knowing
   nothing at all if by that means he could the better serve his Lord and
   Savior, Jesus Christ. Dear Brothers and Sisters, when you are serving
   Christ, do not also seek to serve yourself in a sneaking kind of way.
   It is easily done--under the appearance of glorifying Christ, you may
   really be extolling yourself. You may even seek to win souls with the
   view of having the credit of doing it--and if you do, you will spoil
   the whole work! It must not be so with you. This royal crown must be
   touched by none but Christ. You and I cannot really put the crown on
   His head, though we may wish to do so. Christ is greater than that
   monarch who, when the Pope was about to crown him, took the crown out
   of his hands and said, "I won it myself, so I will put it on my own
   head." And Christ must crown Himself! The words we sometimes sing--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all,"

   are very good and right, but, after all, Christ is His own Glory and
   the Holy Spirit truly glorifies Him. How can we be worthy to put the
   crown on His head when we are not worthy to unloose the laces of His
   shoes! Oh, what poor things we are! We are not fit to be the dust under
   His feet! Glory, glory, glory be unto Him and unto Him alone!

   Thus I think I have said enough about the true messenger. Aim at being
   like John the Baptist in these respects, Brothers and Sisters, as God
   shall help you.

   II. But now, secondly, we are to consider THE TRUE MESSAGE which is
   this--"Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"

   In these few words we have the substance of the message to be delivered
   by God's faithful ministers. First, John declared that God had sent His
   Son into the world that men might live through Him. He taught that
   Jesus of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God, appointed by Him to redeem
   mankind and that He came into the world on purpose that He might save
   His people from their sins. Oh, tell this wondrous story! Tell it till
   every wave bears onward the message and every wind moves it till all
   born of woman have heard the glad tidings that "God so loved the world,
   that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life." All our hopes spring from
   Christ and Him crucified! They begin with Him and they end with Him.
   And whoever believes on Him has everlasting life! But whoever rejects
   Him by not believing Him, there remains no hope for him--he must be
   lost forever! There is but one way to Heaven, and that one way is
   marked by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ!

   Further, in telling the true message, we must go on to explain that
   Jesus Christ is thus the Savior because He is the one Sacrifice for
   sin. This verse reads, in the margin, "Behold the Lamb of God, who
   bears the sin of the world." And in that rendering there is a great
   Truth of God which is not to be kept back. Christ Jesus did actually
   bear the sin of His people in His own body on the tree. It was lifted
   bodily off those whom it would have crushed forever--and it was laid on
   Him. He was, indeed, the great Sin-Bearer--He who knew no sin was made
   sin for us, "that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."
   Now here is a point at which some are always sticking. Robertson, of
   Brighton, with his magnificent genius, practically taught the Atonement
   in some such fashion as Dr. Duncan used to say, that Jesus Christ did
   something or other which, in some way or other, in some degree or
   other, made it possible for men to be forgiven! That was Robertson's
   notion of the Atonement, but we say not so! We say that He really took
   the sin of men upon Himself and who can read that marvelous 53rd
   Chapter of Isaiah without seeing that this is no figure, no metaphor,
   but literal Truth of God--"the Lord has made to meet upon Him the
   iniquity of us all"! So says the Prophet. But what says the Apostle?
   "Who His own Self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." And I
   cannot preach the Gospel without proclaiming this great Truth of
   Christ's atoning Sacrifice and I do not mean to try to do so! I know of
   no way by which sin can be taken off us except by laying it on Him who
   was our Surety and our Substitute. And He did take it and He did bear
   it--and the true messenger, sent from God, tells you that--whatever
   else he may say or may not say.

   And he tells you more than that, namely, what the text says in our
   Authorized Version. "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away"--as well
   as takes upon Himself--"the sin of the world." Oh, blessed word--takes
   it away! Where did

   He take it! I will tell you--"As far as the east is from the west, so
   far has He removed our transgressions from us." He took the sin of all
   Believers away so completely that it sank into the bottom of the sea!
   God has cast it behind His back and it shall not be mentioned against
   them any more forever. There is no such thing, now, as the sin of the
   saints, for Christ has utterly annihilated it. He came to finish
   transgression and to make an end of sins--and if He made an end of
   them, there is an end of them--they are gone forever and those who
   believe in Jesus are washed white as the driven snow and clothed in His
   matchless righteousness! This is what the true messenger has to tell,
   that Jesus bore the sin of His people and that He took it right away.
   Oh, what joyous work is ours!

   This is to be our message--we are to set Christ forth as the Object of
   faith. We are to say to men, "Behold the Lamb of God." Is that all the
   sinner has to do? Yes, behold Him! Never was there another Savior like
   Christ Jesus our Lord. The mere looking at Him saves the soul! Whoever
   looks to Christ lives by that look and shall live forever. There is not
   a sinner in Hell who ever looked on Christ with the eyes of faith--and
   there never shall be such a soul! And all who are in Heaven entered
   there simply through beholding the slain Lamb who takes away the sin of
   the world. Would you get there, young man? Then behold the Lamb of God
   and you shall get there! There is life in a look at the Lamb of God.
   Would you get there, poor sinner, driven and hunted about by the devil?
   Then behold the Lamb of God! Do but look out of the corner of your eye,
   if that is all that you can do. Look through your blinding tears. Look
   through the mists and clouds that surround you. Do but look unto Jesus
   and, as every bitten one who looked at the bronze serpent, lived, so
   every sick soul that looks to Christ shall live--and live forever!

   That is the Gospel, and it is a blessed Gospel to have to preach! And
   blessed is the messenger who proclaims boldly and plainly, in the name
   of Jesus, saying on Christ's behalf, "Look unto Him, and be you saved,
   all you ends of the earth. Look and live." May many do so at this very
   moment!

   III. Now I close by turning to the third head of my discourse which is
   THE TRUE RECEPTION OF THE MESSAGE. How can I truly receive this true
   message of the true messenger? Well, Brothers and Sisters, if we, by
   faith, "behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,"
   observe what we shall do.

   First, we shall follow Jesus. Read from the 35th verse to the 37th
   --"Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. And
   looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God! The two
   disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus." That is to say,
   they did behold the Lamb of God and, believing in Him, they followed
   Him. And if you have really believed in Christ, you will try to walk in
   His footprints. You will call Him Master and Lord. He will be your
   Leader and Commander and you will willingly follow where He leads and
   cheerfully do what He commands. Christ has not come to give you license
   to sin, but He has brought you to liberty from sin. Blessed liberty! If
   you do, indeed, thus look to Christ, follow Him at once! Become His
   disciple, do what He bids you, feeling that it is--

   "Yours not to reason why, Yours not to make reply"

   but just to do as He commands--and believe what He teaches by the
   implicit faith which yields itself up entirely to Him. This is the test
   of real faith in Jesus, that the man is no more his own master, but
   takes Jesus to be his Master and follows wherever He leads.

   The next thing that happens with those who give a true reception to the
   message is that they want to abide with Christ. The two disciples
   followed Jesus and, "They said unto Him, Master, where do You dwell?'
   He said unto them, "Come and see. They came and saw where He dwelt and
   remained with Him that day." I do not know where He dwelt. I am sure
   that it was not a very luxurious mansion and, in later days, he had
   nowhere to lay His head. But as soon as ever these men had looked to
   Him and followed Him, they wanted to live with Him! Oh, that is the
   highest joy of a Christian, to live with Christ! A look of faith saves
   the soul because it is the beginning of a life of living with Christ
   forever and ever! I am afraid that some of God's people fail to realize
   this blessed living with Christ. They get a little joy and they seem
   very pleased with it, but in a little time they lose it. Why is that?
   Because they rejoiced merely in their own joy and when a man does that,
   he will soon lose it. It is as old Master Brooks says, "If a loving
   husband were to give his wife earrings, bracelets, jewels and then,
   instead of loving him for his gifts, she began to be in love with his
   presents and cared little for him, he would be inclined to take them
   away from her so as to have all her love for himself."

   And surely it is so with Christ. He puts the earring of holy joy in His
   bride's ears and she begins to say, "Oh, how joyful I am!" No, no, do
   not talk like that! I heard one, the other day, bragging about his own
   holiness and I thought to myself, "That holiness which talks about
   itself is an unholy holiness." Do you think that holiness is a thing to
   be proclaimed about the streets, or set up for a show? Oh, no! As I
   think of the thrice-holy God, I lay my face in the very dust before
   Him. O Brothers and Sisters, true holiness is something very different
   from this tinsel stuff that men, in these days, boast about as they
   beat their drums! True holiness beats on its breast and gets away into
   its place of secret communion--and if it has any beauties, it shows
   them only to the Lord in secret, with many a blush and many a lament
   that it is not much more nearly what it ought to be. O Beloved, may God
   grant us Grace to follow Jesus and to live with Jesus!

   I said that some of God's people do not seem to understand this living
   with Jesus, but why should not we? Why need we have doubts and fears?
   Why need we get away from Christ? Had we but the faith He deserves and
   believed in Him as He ought to be believed in, we might go from joy to
   joy and so ascend to Heaven as on a ladder of light! God give us this
   Grace of living with Christ! It is to be had by those who seek it
   aright.

   Then, lastly, the proof which these people, who had seen Christ and
   followed Him, gave that they had really found Him was that they went
   and tried to bring others to Him. They said to their kinsfolk and
   acquaintances, "We have found the Messiah!" "We have found Jesus!" Ah,
   you have never truly found Jesus if you do not tell others about Him!
   You know how children act--we ought to be children in all things before
   God. If a little child, in its rambles, were to find honey and its
   brothers and sisters were all around, I feel certain that it would give
   such a cry after it had first sucked its own fingers, that all of them
   would soon be plunging their hands into the honey, too! You have never
   tasted its sweetness if it has not made you cry, "Come here! Was there
   ever such joy as this? Was there ever such delight, such rapture as
   this?" It is the instinct of true children of God to desire to fetch
   others in to taste and see that the Lord is good--to share the
   unspeakable bliss which is already their own!

   Many of you are coming to the Lord's Table. As you come to it, I would
   whisper in your ear, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of
   the world!" Never mind that bread and wine unless you can use them as
   poor old folks often use their spectacles. What do they use them for?
   To look at? No, to look through them. So, use the bread and wine as a
   pair of spectacles--look through them and do not be satisfied until you
   can say, "Yes, yes, I can see the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin
   of the world!" Then shall the Communion be really what it ought to be
   to you. God make it so, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 1:19-51; MATTHEW 4:12-24.

   John 1:19, 20. And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent
   priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? And he
   confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ ' 'I am
   not the One anointed of God to save mankind."

   21. And they asked him, Who then? Are you Elijah?' 'Are you Elijah come
   back to earth?" 21. And he said, I am not For, though indeed he was the
   true piritualElijah who was to come as the forerunner of the Messiah,
   yet, in the sense in which they asked the question, the only truthful
   answer was, "I am not." 21. Are you that Prophet?The long-expected
   prophet foretold by Moses?

   21-23. And he answered, No. Then they said unto him, Who are you, that
   we may give an answer to them that sent us? What do you say of
   yourself? He said, I am the voice. That is all. A voice and nothing
   more. John did not profess to be the Word--he was only the voice which
   vocalized that Word and made it audible to human ears. He came to bear
   witness to the Christ, but he was not, himself, the Christ. "I am the
   voice"

   23-27. Of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
   Lord, as said the Prophet Isaiah. And they which were sent were of the
   Pharisees. and they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you then,
   if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that Prophet? John
   answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands One among
   you, whom you know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred
   before me, whose shoe laces I am not worthy to unloose. How wisely does
   God always choose and fashion His servants! John is evidently just the
   man for his place--he bears testimony to Christ very clearly. He
   earnestly turns away all attention from himself to his Master and he
   has such a reverent esteem for Him of whom he is the herald that he
   puts all honor and glory upon Him.

   28-30. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
   was baptizing, The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said,
   Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. This is He
   of whom I said, after me comes a Man which is preferred before me: for
   He was before me. You know, dear Friends, that Christ existed from all
   eternity, so, in very truth, He wasbefore John. You know, too, the
   glory and the excellency of our Divine Master, so that, in another
   sense, He was and is before John and all other creatures whom He has
   made.

   31-34. And I knew Him not: but that He should be made manifest to
   Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. And John bore record,
   saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and it
   abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with
   water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit
   descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with
   the Holy Spirit. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of
   God. The secret sign of the descent of the Spirit, in dove-like form,
   upon our Lord, was given to John. And as soon as he saw it, he knew for
   sure that Jesus was the Sent One, the Messiah, and that he must point
   Him out to the people.

   35, 36. Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. And
   looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!This was
   the same text from which he had preached the day before and it was the
   same sermon, somewhat shortened. So should it be with us--

   "His only righteousness I show,

   His saving truth proclaim

   'Tis all my business here below

   To cry, 'Behold the Lamb!'"

   37. The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. Thus
   John was losing his own disciples. By his testimony to the Truth of
   God, he was sending them to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. And he did it
   well and gracefully. There are many who would find it a hard task to
   reduce the number of their disciples, but it was not so with John.

   38-46. Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, What
   do you seek? They said unto Him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being
   interpreted, Master) where do You dwell? He said unto them, Come and
   see. They came and saw where He dwelt, and remained with Him that day
   (now it was about the tenth hour). One of the two which heard John
   speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first
   found his own brother, Simon, and said unto him, We have found the
   Messiah, (which is, being interpreted, the Christ). And he brought him
   to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, He said, You are Simon the son of
   Jonah: you shall be called Cephas, (which is by interpretation, A
   Stone). The following day Jesus wanted to go into Galilee, and found
   Philip, and said unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Beth-saida, the
   city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said unto him, We
   have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, did write,
   Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can
   there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come
   and see. I t was all a seeing Gospel John said, "Behold the Lamb of
   God!" Then Jesus said, "Come and see." And now Philip says the same.
   Faith is that blessed sight by which we discern the Savior! Whoever
   looks to Christ by faith shall live!

   47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an
   Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile!' 'There is no craft or
   deception in this man, as there was in Jacob; he is a true Israelite,
   like Israel at his best."

   48. Nathanael said unto Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and
   said unto him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig
   tree, I saw you. What Nathanael had been doing there, we do not know.
   Probably he had been meditating, or he may have been engaged in prayer.
   But this announcement was proof to Nathanael that Jesus could see all
   things and read men's hearts--and know what they were doing in their
   chosen retreats. "When you were under the fig tree, I saw you." Christ
   knows all of you who came in here tonight, in a prayerful spirit,
   seeking Him! And whenever men are seeking Him, you can be sure that He
   is also seeking them!

   49. Nathanael answered and said unto Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of
   God; You are the King of Israel' 'You saw what I was doing in secret
   and by that token I perceive that You are God's own Son."

   50. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw
   you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things
   than these. Those who are ready to believe Christ, on what may be
   thought to be slender evidence, shall "see greater things than these."
   "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed." They
   shall gaze upon a wonderful sight, by-and-by!

   51. And He said unto hiim, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
   you shall see Heaven open, and thee angels of God ascending and
   descending upon the Son of Man. ' 'You are a true Israelite, and you
   shall have Israel's vision. You shall see the same sight as your
   father, Jacob, saw when he fell asleep with a stone for his pillow!
   Only your vision shall be far grander than his." Christ always knows
   how to meet the needs of our hearts and to give us something in
   accordance with our own expressions, and to make His answers fit our
   requests--only He always far exceeds all that we ask or even think,
   blessed be His holy name!

   Matthew 4:12. Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison,
   He departed into Galilee. Notice that there were at that time only two
   great ministers of God, John the Baptist, he must go to prison and to
   death--Jesus, the Son of God, He must go to the desert to be tempted of
   the devil. If any Christians escape temptation, they will not be the
   leaders of the hosts of God! Those who stand in the van must bear the
   brunt of the battle. Oh, that all who are called to such responsible
   positions might be as prepared to occupy them as John was and as Jesus
   was!

   13-16. And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
   upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebu-lun and Naphtali: that it
   might he fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet, saying, The
   land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea,
   beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; the people which eat in
   darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and
   shadow of death light is sprung up. Oh, the tender mercy of our God!
   Where the darkness is the deepest, there the Light of God shines the
   brightest! Christ selects such dark regions as Naphtali and Zebulun
   that He may dwell there and shine in all His Glory.

   17. From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent: for the
   kingdom of Heaven is at hand. He was not afraid to give an earnest
   exhortation to sinners and to bid men repent. He knew better than we do
   the inability of men concerning all that is good, yet He bade them
   repent!

   18-23. And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers,
   Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the
   sea: for they were fishers. And He said unto them, Follow Me and I will
   make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets and
   followed Him. And going on from there, He saw two more brothers, James
   the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their
   father, mending their nets. And He called them. And they immediately
   left the ship and their father, and followed Him. And Jesus went about
   all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of
   the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of
   disease among the people. I like those words, "all manner"--that is,
   Christ met every kind and every sort of sickness and disease. Perhaps
   you, dear Friend, are afflicted in your soul after a very peculiar
   fashion. Yes, but this great Physician heals all manner of diseases!
   None are excluded from the list of patients whom He can cure! Twice the
   words, "all manner," are used--"Healing all manner of sickness and all
   manner of disease among the people."

   24. And His fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto Him
   all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and
   those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatics
   and those that had the palsy; and He healed them. Our Lord Jesus lived
   as in a hospital while He was on earth! Wherever He went, the sins and
   sorrows of men were all open before His sympathetic gaze. But oh, what
   joy it must have been to Him to be able to deal so well with them all!
   Am I addressing any who are sick in soul? Our Master is used to cases
   just like yours! Your malady is not new to Him. He has healed many like
   you--of all that were brought to Him, it is written, "He healed them."
   Lie before Him, now, in all your sin and misery, and breathe the
   prayer, "Son of David, have mercy on me," and He will surely hear you
   and heal you, for He delights to bless and save all who trust Him!

Preparation Necessary for the Communion

   (No. 2647)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING IN THE
   AUTUMN OF 1857.

   "Let a maun examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink
   of the cup." 1 Corinthians 11:28.

   WE do not hold it right to admit all persons indiscriminately to the
   Lord's Supper--we believe the Lord's Table is the place of
   communion--and we would have none there with whom we cannot have true
   Christian fellowship. We can commune with all those who love our Lord
   Jesus Christ, however different may be their views upon some points of
   doctrine. So long as we find it possible to have fellowship with them,
   we believe it to be our duty to welcome them to the Supper of our Lord.
   When, through unholiness of life, lack of piety, or unsoundness in the
   fundamental Truths of the Gospel on the part of those who apply to us
   to be received as communicants, we feel that we cannot commune with
   them, we hold it to be our bounden duty, as God has given us authority
   in His Church, to prevent those from drawing near unto the Table who
   would but commune unworthily and so eat and drink unto themselves
   judgment--as the Word in the 29th verse should be translated. Among our
   Baptist Churches, fashioned, we trust, somewhat nearer to the
   Scriptural order than certain others we know of, we do exercise at
   least some measure of discipline. We require from those who are members
   of the Church and who are, by reason of that membership, entitled to
   commune, that they should, at their reception, give us what we consider
   satisfactory proofs of their conversion. And we require of them,
   afterwards, that their conduct should be consistent with the Law of
   Christ. Otherwise, we would not, in the first place, receive them, or,
   having received them, we would not be long before, by the Scriptural
   process of excommunication, we would remove from our midst those
   members whose lives and conversation were not in accordance with the
   Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, do what we may--though we fence the table
   with the utmost diligence--and though we continually warn you not to
   deceive us. And not to deceive yourselves, seeing that you cannot
   deceive God--yet are we perfectly aware that the greater part of the
   guarding of the Table must rest with yourselves. We believe it to be
   our bounden duty, as God shall give us Grace, to take care, so far as
   we can, that unworthy persons are not received at the Lord's Table. Yet
   man being mortal, is fallible and erring, so we cannot judge you and we
   must leave the greater part of your examination, before you come to the
   sacred Table of the Master, with yourselves. Remember, dear Friends,
   that no recognition by the minister, no reception by the deacons or
   elders of a Church will excuse you for coming to the Lord's Table if,
   when you come, you are not a really converted person. It is true that
   you cannot come there unless the Church, itself, consents to your
   coming--but the Church takes upon itself none of the responsibility of
   your fitness. It says to you, "You may come to the Communion Table, but
   if you have deceived us, on your own head is the sin! And if you are
   not what you profess to be--true believers in Christ--your unlawful
   observance of the ordinance must be accounted for, at the Last Great
   Day, among the rest of your transgressions."

   And I do now, most solemnly and earnestly, as the Pastor of this
   Church, in the name and on behalf of this Church, warn all men and
   women now about to draw near unto this Table that if they are not God's
   children and have no faith in Christ, they stop before they, with
   sacrilegious hands, touch the elements of this sacred Supper! We would
   have them know that it can be of no service to them, but will increase
   their sin and add to their guilt if they, after such a warning as this,
   come to the Master's Table without having examined themselves and
   without being thoroughly persuaded in their hearts that they have been
   born of God--let that thought have due weight with all intending
   communicants--and if some of them even withdraw from the Table as the
   result of this fencing of it, I shall rejoice that they have had the
   honesty to do what is right.

   I. Now, Beloved, turning from that point for a little while, I would
   remind you that THERE IS A PREPARATION NECESSARY FOR RECEIVING THE
   LORD'S SUPPER ARIGHT.

   In certain churches, among persons who are only nominally
   religious--mere formalists and ceremonialists--it has been customary to
   set apart a whole week for preparation. And you may remember how Mr.
   Rowland Hill, in his Village Dialogues, tells of Mistress Too-Good,
   who, after spending a whole week in preparation for the Lord's Supper,
   found that it was not to be administered till the next
   Sabbath--whereupon she fell into a great passion and cursed and swore
   because she said that she had wasted a week! I doubt not that there
   have been some who have made a kind of hypocritical preparation which
   would have been better omitted. I do not exhort you to do any such
   thing! But if a right thing is abused, that is no reason why we should
   not use it properly. Everyone of us, before we come to the Supper of
   the Lord, ought to have prepared our hearts, under the help of the Holy
   Spirit, for a right participation. We are not to rush to our Master's
   Table as a horse runs into the battle, not knowing where it is going!
   We are not to come to this sacred Feast as we go to a meal in our own
   houses. We are not to partake of the emblems of the body and blood of
   Christ as we would sit down at our common tables to eat and drink.

   We are to come here with devout solemnity and due preparation. Nor may
   we expect to receive a blessing, in the reception of the Supper, unless
   we have properly prepared ourselves for it before we come here. Alas,
   this is too much for-gotten--and men think they may draw near to God
   without making any preparation whatever! Not so was it with the ancient
   saints. When Jacob was going to build an altar and to sacrifice to the
   Lord at Bethel, he felt it necessary to bid his family to put away all
   their strange gods from among them. When God was about to appear on
   Sinai, He commanded the people to purify themselves because He was
   coming near to them. And not only was it so in olden times, but it
   should be so now. We should not draw near unto God with hasty and
   careless steps, but we must remember and obey Solomon's
   injunction--"Keep your foot when you go to the House of God, and be
   more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they
   consider not that they do evil." As Moses took his shoes off because
   the place whereon he stood was holy ground, so ought we, my Brothers
   and Sisters, to put away all carnal thoughts and all worldly things
   when we approach this most sacred circle--a circle even more hallowed
   than that which surrounded the burning bush, for this surrounds the
   cross of Calvary, the death place of our Lord and Master--

   "Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,

   Which before the Cross I spend,

   Life, and health, and peace possessing,

   From the Sinner's dying Friend!

   Here I'll sit forever viewing

   Mercy's streams in streams of blood!

   Precious drops my soul bedewing,

   Plead and claim my peace with God!

   Truly blessed is this station,

   Low before His Cross to lie

   While I see Divine compassion

   Floating in His languid eyes!

   Here it is I find my Heaven,

   While upon the Cross I gaze.

   Love I much? I've more forgiven--

   I'm a miracle of Grace!

   May I still enjoy this feeling,

   In all need to Jesus go

   Prove His wounds each day more healing,

   And Himself more fully know." Let me press upon your consideration two
   or three thoughts with regard to what is necessary in a proper
   preparation for the Lord's Supper. First, I think, before coming to the
   Lord's Table, every professing Christian should occupy himself, in some
   measure, in contemplation and meditation. We ought not to come here
   without due consideration of what we are about to do. We ought to
   consider, in the first place, that we are coming into the more
   immediate Presence of God. It is true that during Divine service in the
   House of God we are especially in the Presence of the Most High, but
   when, at eventide, we eat and drink the Supper of the Master, we get
   nearer to Him than we do in any of our other religious exercises, with
   the solitary exception of the ordinance of Believers' Baptism. This
   Communion service has about it something so humbling, so tender, so
   full of fellowship--bringing us so near to Christ--while Christ is so
   near to us, that we ought not to come to it without feeling that we are
   entering into the immediate courts of the Most High! And, surely, if
   the contemplation of God makes the angels veil their faces with their
   wings, it should make us come to this Table with great reverence and
   solemnity of spirit.

   We ought, in the next place, before we come here, contemplate the
   authority upon which we celebrate this ordinance. If any of you come to
   this Table because I administer the ordinance, or because your parents
   partake of it, or because, according to the old orthodox doctrine of
   the Baptist Churches, this is regarded as being a Divine ordinance, you
   have made a mistake! It is your duty, in the reception of the Lord's
   Supper, or the observance of the ordinance of Baptism, to consider the
   authority by which you do it and to be certain that, in coming here,
   you are doing God's will and that you are performing that which God has
   commanded you. If you come not to the Communion as to a Divine
   ordinance, you come not to it aright. If you merely partake of it as a
   matter of form, instead of knowing that God has commanded the form and
   that His Son, Jesus Christ, is embodied in it, you have not the
   preparation which you ought to have in coming here.

   Again, before coming to the Communion, it behooves you to consider the
   great distance there is between you and God. Even though you now have
   very blessed and hallowed fellowship with the Lord Jesus, remember that
   in this Supper, there is a memorial of your guilt. It is true that you
   see here how your sins were taken away by the broken body and the shed
   blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, but let the very bath in which you were
   cleansed remind you of your sinfulness! And, oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, when we sit here, let us not eat and drink in a showy manner,
   as if we were doing some praiseworthy act, but let us do it as if we
   felt that we were not fit to sit on the lowest seat of the Church of
   Christ. God grant that this may be a time when we shall humble
   ourselves and cast ourselves in the very dust before Him! We might,
   instead of being at the Table of the Lord, have been sitting on the
   ale-bench. We might have been drinking the cup of devils and holding
   communion with Belial--but Grace, Free Grace, has brought us here! Let
   us abase ourselves in the Presence of God. Let us humble ourselves
   before Him and, while we feed, by faith, on our Master's body, let us
   feel as if our own proud flesh were cut away and humbled by the very
   communion we hold with Christ, our Redeemer.

   Then, Christian, this should be a further subject of contemplation
   before you come here--you should have a right idea of the Savior, whose
   body and blood are here typified to you. I think we should not come to
   this ordinance unless we have, for some time at least, devoutly
   considered the broken body, the shed blood, the sufferings, the
   agonies, the death and the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let
   us all, before we sit at this Table, remember whose death it is we
   commemorate here. We should view the Savior as the Son of God and then
   as the Son of Man, born of the Virgin Mary. We should view Him as He
   walks along His way of sorrow. We should seek, by earnest
   contemplation, to view Him prostrate in the Garden, to see Him plowed
   with bloody furrows at Gabbatha and to behold Him dying amid terrible
   tortures upon the hill of Calvary. Unless, my Brothers and Sisters, we
   have done this, or are enabled by God's Spirit in a special manner to
   do this, now, we must not expect to derive any benefit from the mere
   eating of the bread and drinking of the wine. You might eat your bread
   and drink your wine at home. You might be taking your ordinary suppers.
   You might break your crusts and drink from your cups in your own
   houses. But of what use would all of this be? They would not be the
   Lord's Supper and neither shall thsbe the Lord's Supper to you unless
   your hearts are occupied with a devout contemplation of the Presence of
   God, of your own nothingness before Him and of the glorious Sacrifice
   and Atonement of Jesus Christ evidently set forth before you.

   In the next place, not only contemplation, but supplication should form
   a part of our preparation for this Supper If we acted aright, we would
   never come, even to the hearing of a sermon, without prayer! Were our
   hearts in a proper spiritual condition, we would never leave our houses
   to go to the House of Prayer without first supplicating God to help the
   minister and to help us! We would never leave the tents of Jacob
   without asking that the pillar of cloud might be manifestly seen
   resting upon the tabernacle of Israel. We would, when we come up to
   God's sanctuary, breathe a prayer the moment we enter it, crying out
   for the Holy Spirit to rest upon us during this day. And certainly, if
   we ever neglect prayer before holy duties, it should never be omitted
   before this sacred Supper! O my Brothers and Sisters, I fear that many
   of us have lost the sweetness of this ordinance because we have
   forgotten to pray for a blessing upon it! It was but this very day that
   I found myself preparing to come to this place without having, first of
   all, sought fellowship with Jesus--and I felt grieved and vexed within
   my spirit that I should have been so guilty as to have forgotten the
   solemnities to which I was about to attend! And, by His Grace, I sought
   at once to spend some time in silent meditation and prayer to God. So
   should every Church member do likewise.

   Oh, what blessed communion services would we have then! We would not go
   away from the Table of the Lord barren and cold, as we often have done,
   blaming the minister because we think he has not spoken with
   sufficiently affecting words and has not distributed the sacred
   elements in a profitable manner. Whereas the fault has been in
   ourselves and not in the minister--and we have been eating and drinking
   unworthily. And, as the judgment upon that wrong state of heart, we
   have found the Lord's Table, itself, to be barren instead of proving it
   to be the King's banqueting house and a feast of fat things to our
   souls!

   II. Now, Beloved, I ask you to notice that MY TEXT GIVES US THE BEST
   PART OF PREPARATION, WHICH IS SELF-EXAMINATION. "Let a man examine
   himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup."

   How many of us have thus examined ourselves? I fear many of us have
   come here without any self-examination whatever. Well, then, let us
   begin at once to examine ourselves and, during the little interval
   between this service and the time of the administration of the Supper,
   perhaps it might not be amiss if you were to read over the hymn which
   we sometimes sing, from which you can see what are the questions
   incumbent upon you to ask yourselves in self-examination and what are
   the marks of those who have the right to sit down at the Table of the
   Lord--

   "The sacred Word declares them such,

   Whose hearts are changed by Sovereign Grace,

   Who place their confidence and hope

   In Jesus' blood and righteousness.

   Who know the Truth and in the ways

   Of holiness direct their feet.

   Who love communion with the saints

   And shun the place where scorners meet.

   With past attainments not content,

   Increasing purity they seek.

   By whom uprightness is maintained

   In all they do, and all they speak.

   These are the men whom God invites,

   For them the Church sets wide her door,

   Whatever their birth or rank may be,

   The bond, the free, the rich, the poor!" This hymn suggests some solemn
   questions which none of us ought to have ventured here without having
   answered. And I think many of us can easily answer them. My Brothers
   and Sisters, have we not been changed by Sovereign Grace? Can we not,
   each one, say, "By the Grace of God I am what I am and I am not, now,
   what I was once"? Can we not, unless we are awfully deceived, say, with
   unfaltering lips, "We know whom we have believed and we are persuaded
   that we have been born again"? If we cannotsay so--O my Friends, if any
   one of you cannot say so, I charge you, before God, before Jesus Christ
   and the elect angels--if you cannot say that you believe and know that
   you have been born again, do not come and profane this Table of the
   Master by daring to sit with the saints while you are unrenewed and not
   begotten again unto a lively hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead! How many of you are among those whom the hymn next
   describes?--

   "Whoplace their confidence and hope

   In Jesus' blood and righteousness." I know that, by God's Grace, it is
   so with many of us. I have no other hope! No rock, no refuge for my
   weary spirit is there beside the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I trust you
   can say so, too, my dear Friends. But if you cannot. If you are resting
   anywhere else but in Jesus. If you have any dependence upon rites or
   ceremonies or good works, I again solemnly command you by the Judge of
   the quick and the dead--venture not to this Table to receive the Lord's
   Supper--for, in so doing, you would but eat and drink unworthily, not
   having faith in Jesus and confidence in His precious blood.

   Can you say, also, as the hymn does, that you know the Truth and that
   in the ways of holiness you direct your feet?\ fear we must all confess
   that we cannot say this as much as we would desire. Let us, however,
   still make it a point of self-examination. Come, Friend, it is now a
   month since the last time you sat down at this Table--what have you
   done during this time? How have your steps been directed? How has your
   speech been ordered? What about your acts towards God? Towards man?
   Make this a time of turning over the pages of your diary for the last
   month. Come, Brothers and Sisters, let us examine ourselves and so let
   us eat of this bread, and drink of this cup. It cannot be an
   unprofitable exercise which is commanded in our text, so let us obey
   it! Let us now question ourselves. Are we truly the Lord's? If He
   should say to us, as He said to His disciples, "One of you shall betray
   Me," what would we say? Let us, each one, ask the question now, "Lord,
   is it I?" Have we, like Judas, been plotting against the Master? Have
   we been robbing the Lord's treasury, depriving Him of what we promised
   in our vows? Not giving Him the time and service which we solemnly
   pledged to give

   Him?

   Let us look again at our hymn. Have we broken the communion of saints
   during the last months?Have we not, by anger and wrath and bitterness,
   injured our own spirituality when we have been talking against the
   children of God? Have we not felt that we have broken the sacred link
   which united us with them? Have we washed the saints' feet this month?
   Have we not rather bemired and befouled them by going astray,
   ourselves, and leading them astray, too? Have we humbled ourselves
   during the last month? Have we taken the towel and girded ourselves, as
   Jesus did, to do menial work for the Church? Has there not been too
   much pride creeping into all our services? Has it not marred all our
   deeds and spoiled our best endeavor? And how about prayer? Have we not
   been sadly negligent in that holy exercise? And with regard to love to
   our Master, have not our hearts been too often cold towards Him, who
   had His heart set open for us, that all the blood therein might be
   spilt in one great torrent for our sakes?

   Friends, I cannot suggest all the questions that you have need to ask
   yourselves in such an examination as our text enjoins! Begin from the
   last Communion evening and go through the Sundays, through the Mondays,
   and Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and all through the weeks--and then
   surely both you and I will have work enough to do, during the next
   hour, to examine ourselves! Ah, we ought to have done it before, that
   we might be able, now, to apply ourselves more solemnly to Communion
   rather than to self-examination. But now I entreat you once again, as I
   am bound to do, to be faithful to my God--if you are lovers of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. If you are faithful to the Truth of God. If you have been
   really converted--if you have partaken of the Holy Spirit--I invite you
   to the Master's Table and may the Spirit of God rest on you! But, as an
   honest minister, I warn you who are not what you should be from coming
   to this Table. Oh, if any of you have been mere professors and
   hypocrites, I charge you not to come here! As in your dying day you
   shall remember your deeds of formality and hypocrisy, I beseech you, do
   not dare to touch that bread with unhallowed lips, nor sip that wine!
   Do not take them unless you feel that you have God's Spirit within you
   and are really united to the Lamb!

   1 fear there are some of you who have, for many months received these
   emblems, who would this night, for the first time, leave them untasted
   if you really knew yourselves! There are some in this Church, I grieve
   to say, with whom I can hold but very little fellowship by reason of
   the hard words they sometimes utter against certain of us because of
   some little difference of opinion. And there are many others with whom
   we can have no communion at all because their lives are so unholy and
   their conduct is so un-Christian that, though they are sound enough in
   the faith, we can but wonder that they know so much of the Truth and
   yet have so little of the spirit of Christ in them. Ah, dear Friends,
   it is not all gold that glitters, and all professors are not
   possessors! There are some in Christ's Church everywhere and God forbid
   that I should flatter this Church--there are some even here--who are
   enough to tear the church in two by their bitterness, and wrath, and
   evil speaking! There are others who are enough to bring down God's rod
   upon us for their unholy living-- yes, and the very best of us, the
   Johns and the Enochs--have they not cause to humble themselves on
   account of their manifold shortcomings and misdoings? Let all
   professors of religion examine themselves lest it should be found that
   they have been deceiving themselves and others--have trusted in
   themselves that they were righteous when they had not passed from death
   unto life!

   Ah, Friends! I cannot speak with the solemnity I would desire to
   command on such an occasion as this. I cannot bar this table, God
   forbid that I should do so!--from any one of you--come and welcome all
   you who love the Lord Jesus!

   But although I cannot force back any of you who are not converted.
   Though I cannot thrust you away if you have the right to come, because
   you are members of this Church or of some other, I do, as far as human
   power can have any influence with you, solemnly warn you not to come to
   the Communion unless you are really regenerated by the Holy Spirit! I
   would rather have six members in my Church, who are living souls in
   Zion, than 600 mere professors. O Lord God, sift and fan this Church
   yet again! If any are only chaff, drive them out of it, or make them
   Your wheat, that they may be housed in Your barn and not be burned up
   with unquenchable fire! O Lord, make each of us sincere! Impress upon
   our minds the solemnity of this act and when we draw near unto this
   Table, may it be especially under Your smile and with Your benediction,
   through Jesus Christ our Lord! To God the Father, God the Son and God
   the Holy Spirit, be glory forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM116.

   I knew a godly woman who, when she was very sick, would always say,
   "Read me the 116th Psalm." It is deservedly a great favorite with many
   experienced Christians. May the Holy Spirit apply it to our hearts as
   we read it!

   Verse 1. I love the LORD, because He has heard my voice and my
   supplications. It is a great condescension on God's part to listen to
   us. You know what a comfort it is to find a sympathetic listener who
   will let you tell out your griefs. It is not wise to tell them to
   everybody, but there are some who have an ear into which it is both
   pleasant and profitable to pour the story of our woes. Because God had
   listened to the voice of His servant's supplications, David therefore
   said, "I love the Lord." Nothing will make us love God better than the
   assurance that He hears our prayers. We could not love a deaf God, so,
   when Jehovah does attend to our voice and our supplications, we feel
   drawn more closely than ever to Him.

   2. Because He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   Him as long as I live. That same blessed experience which is a reason
   for love is also an argument for continued prayer. "As He has heard me,
   He shall still hear me. As He has listened to me, He shall listen to me
   again--at least, it shall not be for lack of my cries that He does not
   listen." That expression, "He has inclined His ear unto me," seems to
   me to mean, "He has stooped down to me to catch my faintest words. He
   has been favorable to me. He has smiled as He has heard my broken
   prayers and cries. He has inclined His ear unto me. It was not a mere
   hearing such as His Omniscience might warrant me to expect--it was such
   a favorable hearing as only Infinite Love would have given to me and,
   oh, if He is so favorable as to hear, can I be so ungrateful as not to
   pray?" Here was the case that David had laid before the Lord.

   3. The sorrows of death compassed me. Just as the dogs surround the
   poor stag and shut him in the fatal circle. 3. And the pains of Hell
   got hold upon me. They set their teeth into him as the dogs do into the
   stag.

   3. I found trouble and sorrow. He was in a double grief--he had trouble
   outside and sorrow within--it was troubled sorrow and sorrowful
   trouble, wormwood mingled with gall.

   4. Then called I upon the name of the LORD. That was the very best time
   to pray. Satan does his utmost to prevent our praying when we are in
   extremities, but, oh, dear Friends, if Jonah prayed in the whale's
   belly, where can you and I be where we may not and cannot pray? If we
   sat down upon the very doorstep of Hell--yes, if the Pit opened her
   mouth to swallow us up, we might still pray! And the mercy is, that
   while we are on praying ground we are also on the ground of Grace where
   God can meet with us! "Then called I upon the name of the Lord."

   4. O LORD, I beseech You, deliver my soul It was a short prayer--an
   eager, earnest petition--full of passionate importunity. There was no
   dictating to God how the deliverance should be worked. "I beseech You,
   deliver my soul. Do it in Your own way. Do it in the way that will
   bring most glory to You. If You do not deliver my body, yet deliver my
   soul. If my goods must go. If all I have must melt away, yet, O
   Jehovah, I beseech You, deliver my soul!" This is one of the best
   prayers in the whole Bible. It is very much like the publican's prayer,
   "God be merciful to me a sinner."

   5. Gracious is the LORD, and righteous. That is a strange combination
   which the ungodly cannot understand. It is a riddle never to be read
   except at the Cross! "Gracious is the Lord, and righteous." That is
   what every troubled conscience wants to know--how God can be just and
   yet can pardon sin--but we who have believed in Jesus do know! It is
   our joy to say, "Gracious is the Lord, and righteous."

   5. Yes, our God is merciful I always feel inclined to mispronounce that
   word, or to divide it into two, and read it, "Our God is mercy full,"
   for so He is--He is brimming over with mercy!

   6. The LORD preserves the simple. The sincere--sometimes the
   ignorant--those who do not pretend to know. Or, the simple, those from
   whose heart the Lord has driven out all guile, making them to be
   simple-minded. They are such fools (as the world calls them) as to be
   believers in the Lord Jesus Christ--and that is to perform the highest
   act of wisdom on the part of man! They are such simpletons as to
   believe the old, old Bible, and to cling to the great atoning
   Sacrifice, and to let the novelties of modern thought blow away like
   the down of the thistle in the summer breeze! "The Lord preserves the
   simple." How did David know that? Listen.

   6. I was brought low and He helped me. There is no way of knowing a
   general doctrine so good as that of having a particular experience of
   it! "I was brought low, brought to be a simpleton, brought so very low
   that I was obliged to pray a simple prayer--brought so very, very low
   that I was obliged to have a simple faith in God--for I had nobody else
   to believe in and nobody else to trust. 'I was brought low, and He
   helped me.'" What a help that is--a help in which God virtually does it
   all--for our poor weakness, with its best attempts, would rather hinder
   than help.

   7. Return unto your rest, O my soul; for the LORD has dealt bountifully
   with you. Poor dove, you are dropping into the water. Your wings can
   scarcely sustain you--come back to Noah--"Return unto your Noah, O my
   soul!" That is the Old Testament reading of it and the New Testament
   rendering is, "Return unto your Jesus, O my soul, for He is your true
   rest! Get back to Him, 'for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.'
   In past times, when you were dwelling with Him in close communion, it
   was better with you than it is now, that you have wandered from Him.
   Return, return, poor prodigal, for there is every inducement to bring
   you back! In your Father's house there is bread enough and to spare. He
   never stinted you. 'The Lord has dealt bountifully with you' and He is
   dealing bountifully with you even now in giving you the opportunity to
   come back, in giving you the power to pray and in permitting you to go
   to the blood-sprinkled Mercy Seat."

   8. For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and
   my feet from falling. Just now he prayed, "Deliver my soul." He has
   received the answer to his petition, for he says, "You have delivered
   my soul from death." He said nothing, then, about his eyes, but God
   gives exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. He did not
   say anything about his feet, but the Lord gave him a blessing for them,
   also--"You have delivered my feet from falling." Oh, for an all-over
   blessing, a blessing from head to foot--from the eyes that stream with
   tears to the feet that are slipping away from under us! A blessing that
   begins within by delivering the soul and then works its way into the
   very countenance and makes it resplendent with joy and thankfulness and
   gets into the daily life, helping us to march boldly along the slippery
   way! Glory be to God! He has given this deliverance to many of us!

   9. I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.' 'I will not
   care who sees me so long as He sees me. I will court no presence but
   His Presence, 'I will walk before Jehovah.'" It is grand walking under
   a constant sense of the Lord's inspection and a delightful
   consciousness of His smile! This is like Enoch's walk and you know how
   it ends, for Enoch could not die for the life of him--he walked so near
   to God that he did not pass into Heaven by the ordinary road--he "was
   not, for God took him." And we, too, though we may die as to these
   bodies, know that we shall never die as to our souls, for He has given
   to us who have believed in Jesus, eternal life! And we can never die or
   be separated from Him.

   10. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted. ' 'I
   believed." Come, Friends, can you all say that? It is a blessed thing
   for you if you can say that when the sorrows of death compass you and
   the pains of the grave lay hold upon you. That is glorious faith which
   says, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." "I believed,
   therefore have I spoken." Faith is not a dumb Grace of God--it will
   make its voice heard.

   11. I said in my haste, All men are liars. You see, he had once spoken
   in the power of the flesh. It was well, therefore, that he should now
   speak in the power of faith. "I said in my haste, All men are liars."
   But it was true for all that, for they will fail us if we trust them
   instead of the Lord. Yet, in another sense, they are not all liars, so
   David retracts the hasty words which might have a double meaning and
   might imply what he did not intend, or what he should not mean. See how
   quickly he turns away from this unpleasant subject! Note what comes
   next.

   12. What shalIrender unto the LORD for all His benefits toward me?
   "There," he seems to say, "put all men away, I have done with them. If
   they are all liars, let us say no more about them, but let us turn to
   God." When you, dear

   Friends, are disappointed with men, do not sit down and worry--you
   should have known what to expect before you began with them--and now
   you have found it to be so, turn it to good account. David feels that
   he has received everything from God, so he says, "What shall I render
   unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?" Well, what can he do?
   His own poverty comes rushing over his sight, again, and the answer to
   his question is--

   13. I will take the cup of salvation, and callupon the name of the
   LORD.''I ask, 'What shall I render?' and I reply, 'I will take.'" That
   is what you and I also must say--

   "The best return for one like me, So wretched and so poor, Is from His
   gifts to draw a plea, And ask Him still for more."

   You have given God all you have when you have given Him your weakness,
   your sin, your emptiness--that is all that is truly yours--and then it
   is that you render to Him that which He asks for, that He may put away
   your sin, that He may fill your emptiness and glorify Himself in your
   weakness.

   14. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all His
   people. If you have made any vows, mind that you keep them. It is often
   better not to vow, but when the vow is made, let it be diligently paid.

   15. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. It is
   very painful for us to witness, but it is precious to God. We think
   that they have ended their usefulness when they reach that point, but
   God estimates their very death to be precious! Tread very softly when
   you go to the bedside of a departing saint--you may brush against an
   angel's wing, for the room is full of them--the place whereon you stand
   is holy ground! Troops of angelic messengers are there to do their
   Master's bidding in the last hours of His child--which are about to
   become his first hours in Glory! Besides, the Master, Himself, is
   there--He is never absent when His children are dying. "Precious in the
   sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."

   16. O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of
   Your handmaid. "Born in Your own house, of one who belonged to You--a
   home-born slave--and glad to glory in that fact! Born in Your house,
   bought with Your money and yielding up myselfjoyfully to You--'I am
   Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid.'"

   16. You have loosed my bonds. Why, we thought he was going to say,
   "Your Grace has, like a fetter, bound my wandering heart to You." Just
   so--that is the liberty which he enjoys--"You have loosed my bonds." We
   are never so free as when free-will has had its deathblow and we have
   come under the power of Sovereign Grace. And now there is another
   free-will, born of Grace, and with its full consent we give ourselves
   up to God, saying, with David, "O Lord, truly I am Your servant; You
   have loosed my bonds."

   17. I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call
   upon the name of the LORD. Now David has grown into a priest, offering
   sacrifices. He has also grown into a singer, praising the Lord with
   thanksgiving, and he has grown into a preacher--"And will call upon the
   name of the Lord." The very man who found the pains of Hell laying hold
   upon him is now engaged in the holiest exercises!

   18. 19. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all His
   people, in the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of you, O
   Jerusalem. Praise you the LORD. Or, "Hallelujah!" I cannot close this
   reading without remarking how often my ears are shocked with the
   blasphemous way in which this thrice-holy word is dragged into the
   mire-- "Hallelujah fiddles!" "Hallelujah lasses!" and I know not what.
   "Hallelujah"--praise unto Jehovah--is one of those words which never
   ought to be pronounced except with the utmost solemnity! Although there
   should be mixed with it the most rapturous joy. Let us take heed lest
   we be found guilty of taking the name of the Lord, Jehovah, our God, in
   vain, by using that word flippantly. But let us solemnly feel in our
   hearts and say with our lips, "Hallelujah--Praise the

   Lord!"

Sacred Memories

   (No. 2648)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   9, 1882.

   "Let Jerusalem come into Your mind." Jeremiah 51:50.

   This message from the Lord was written by the Prophet Jeremiah to the
   Jews who were carried away to Babylon or even to more distant places.
   They were entreated not to forget the holy city where they had
   worshipped Jehovah in His Temple. Among all their thoughts, they were
   bidden to take care that the thought of Jerusalem should often come
   into their minds. This would keep them from settling down in the places
   to which they had been carried as captives. They were always far too
   ready to mingle with other nations and to forget that God had separated
   them to be a people unto Himself forever. So Jeremiah begged them to
   keep the holy city in their minds, that they might not judge themselves
   as having become Persians or Babylonians, but might still remember that
   they were Israelites and that Jerusalem was their mother city and home.

   Besides, this kind of meditation would raise in their hearts ardent
   longings to get back. "Let Jerusalem come into your mind," that is,
   "Sigh for it. Earnestly desire to come back to it and as you cut the
   various ties which bind you to the distant land, let the links which
   unite you to Jerusalem become stronger every day." We know, from the
   137th Psalm, that this is just what the captives did--"By the rivers of
   Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept when we remembered Zion. We
   hung our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they
   that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that
   wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of
   Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget
   you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not
   remember you, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer
   not Jerusalem above my chief joy." This was a proof that they regarded
   the country where they dwelt--and where many of them prospered and
   became great--as a place of banishment. Their pathetic lament proved
   that they never could be truly happy till they were back at the place
   of Israel's solemn assemblies, the spot which was specially dedicated
   to the worship of the Most High.

   This feeling that they were aliens in a strange land and their longing
   desire to return to their native country would make them quick to
   observe everything that might work for the good of Jerusalem. If any of
   them came to be the king's cupbearer, as Nehemiah was, or occupied any
   position at court, as Mordecai and Esther did, they would be on the
   lookout for opportunities of working for the good of their beloved city
   and they would avail themselves of every occasion for protecting and
   benefiting the race to which they belonged. This was the Prophet's
   desire and it was also the Lord's purpose, that they might find no
   permanent satisfaction in Babylon, but always sigh for the city of
   their solemnities, "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
   earth"--that they might neversing the praises of Shushan, but might
   reserve all their admiration for Zion, where God revealed Himself to
   His people as He never did to the other nations of the earth.

   It is somewhat in the same sense that I beg you, who are the Lord's
   people, to remember the spiritualJerusalem and, for similar reasons,
   that you may feel that this world is not your rest, that your
   citizenship is not upon earth, but is in Heaven, that you may sing,
   from your very heart--

   "Jerusalem, my happy home! My soul still pants for you."

   I shall use the text in two ways and show you, first, that there is a
   Jerusalem here belo w which should come into our minds. And, secondly,
   that there is a Jerusalem above which should come into our minds.

   I. First, we will use the text with reference to THE JERUSALEM HERE
   BELOW WHICH SHOULD COME INTO

   OUR MINDS, that is, the Church of God on earth. The Church is all one,
   whether in Heaven or on earth. I may call the heavenly Jerusalem the
   Upper City where stands the tower of David, built for an armory, and
   the Temple in all its glory. While here below is the Lower City--but
   one wall runs around all. There is but one Church of the living God--

   "For all the servants of our King, In earth and Heaven are one." Still,
   at present, the division stands good because it is so to our
   experience. And we still have to say, concerning the "one army of the
   living God"--

   "Part of His host have crossed the flood, And part are crossing now."

   So, taking our text as referring to the Church of God on earth, I say
   to you, first, that if you are a true Believer, let it come into your
   mind so that you may unite yourself with its citizens. Some of you who
   love the Lord have attended to almost everything except the one thing
   which you ought to have done as soon as you trusted in Christ, namely,
   cast in your lot with the people of God on earth. You have made your
   will, you have kept your business affairs straight and right. You have
   set your family matters in order. All of that is as it should be, but
   still, "let Jerusalem come into your mind." And there are some of you
   who are Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ who, if you didthink of this
   matter, would have to say, "I am not an avowed member of Christ's
   Church. I trust that I belong to Jesus, but I have not said as much as
   that by my public profession. I hope that I follow Him, but I am afraid
   that it is only afar off and that I wear a mask which hides my
   Christianity. I have not come out boldly and said, 'I am on the Lord's
   side.' There sits the man of whom Bunyan writes, 'with a book and his
   inkhorn before him,' but I have never said to him, 'Set down my name,
   Sir. I, also, belong to Jesus of Nazareth, and I will be numbered with
   His people.' They may not be all I would like them to be, but I am
   afraid they are far better than I am--and if I might but have the
   lowest place among them, I would be glad. 'I had rather be a doorkeeper
   in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.'"

   I am not now talking about what is essential to salvation. I have no
   doubt that there are many true-hearted pilgrims to Zion who steal away
   to Heaven alone. They do not go on pilgrimage with their fellows and
   they are not to be commended for this, for they miss many privileges in
   neglecting Christian fellowship and, besides, they are not so
   serviceable to their Lord and Master. Let these lone saints seriously
   think over this question. If all the children of God were to go to
   Heaven in that fashion, each one, alone, where would there be any
   visible Church of God on earth at all? How would Gospel ordinances be
   maintained? How would the war for King Jesus be carried on? But, if one
   may do it, all may do it--and it is always an evil thing for any child
   of God to be doing what he would not have the rest of his Brothers and
   Sisters doing!

   I remember that, one night, while preaching here, I told you that some
   Christians are like rats behind the wall. On the following Wednesday,
   when I sat to see enquirers, I had several who said that they would not
   be rats any longer. They could not bear to have such a title as that,
   so they resolved that they would come out and confess Christ! I was
   very glad to have barked so loudly as to frighten them out of their
   holes and I would like to do the same thing again! If you belong to
   Christ, say so in His own appointed way! In party politics, men are not
   generally ashamed to show on which side they are. And people of various
   nationalities, wherever they wander, are not ashamed to be called
   Britons, or Americans, or whatever they are. Then why should we, who
   are followers of the Savior, be ashamed to acknowledge His blessed
   name! Let it not be so, but rather, cry, "If there is a cross to be
   carried, here is a shoulder, ready to bear it!" Say you not so, my dear
   Friends? If there is any shame to be borne for Christ, will you stand
   back there, snug and comfortable, and let others bear it all alone? No.
   I think I hear you say, "If there is any mud to be thrown at Christ's
   followers, let it be thrown at me. If there is any enmity to be shown
   to the chosen people of God, let me participate in it, for, as I hope
   to share their glory, so would I willingly bear a portion of their
   shame."

   Come now, you who have forgotten all about this matter! I beg to repeat
   my text especially to you--"Let Jerusalem come into your mind." Let
   this message be to you like the still small voice of Jehovah was to
   Elijah. And go and put your name down among Christ's disciples and let
   it not be merely a nominal thing, but give your person and your purse,
   your time and your talents to Christ and to His Church--and may the
   blessing of the Master rest upon you in doing it!

   Taking it for granted that you have done this, I would next say to you,
   "Let Jerusalem come into your mind" by praying for its prosperity.
   "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love you." I
   think that in all our prayers, there should always be a petition for
   the one great Church of Jesus Christ. You know that in David's penitent
   cry, in the 51st Psalm, when he bemoaned his sin and sought the
   pardoning mercy of God, he could not close his supplication without
   saying, "Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion: build You the walls
   of Jerusalem." So, when your sin and your repentance for it seem as if
   they must engross your prayer, and you must, with many sighs and tears,
   seek mercy for yourself, yet, even then, be not selfish, but pray for
   all who are in a same case with yourself. And pray for that happier
   band who have found mercy through the bleeding Lamb and are numbered
   with the people of God. There should be no private prayer--there should
   be no family prayer--there certainly should be no publicprayer, without
   petitions for the prosperity of the Church of God in every place. Take
   care that you do not forget that important matter--in this sense, "let
   Jerusalem come into your mind."

   And when this has been done, what are we to do next? Why, then, let us
   labor for the advancement of the good cause. If there is any object in
   the world worth living for, it is the Glory of the Lord Jesus and the
   salvation and the sanctifica-tion of those whom He has purchased with
   His precious blood. Now, to this end--that the Church of Christ may be
   made perfect in Him--there is much to be done in the ingathering of
   sinners and the helping and comforting and perfecting of saints. And
   you and I ought to take our fair share of this blessed work! There are
   some who have no time for any holy duties--from the moment they wake in
   the morning till they go to bed at night, they voluntarily give up all
   their energies to making money. I would like to whisper in their ear
   very softly, "Let Jerusalem come into your mind." Does not God deserve
   at least somepart of their time? And His Church some little effort for
   her extension? There are some people who are busy, here and there, and
   rightly so, in all sorts of philanthropic movements, but they seem to
   forget that the greatest philanthropic organization on the face of the
   earth is the Church of the living God! And that there is nothing which
   can so bless the world as Christ in the midst of His own people.

   I would like to step up to these friends and say to them, "'Let
   Jerusalem come into your mind.' Give the Lord Jesus some of your help.
   Consecrate to His cause some of your thought--some of your most tender
   affection." It is a great pity when we cannot do anything for
   Christ--are there any Christians who are in that sad condition? Are
   they without hands--without feet--without eyes--without
   tongues--without hearts? Well, then, I do not think they can do much if
   that is the case. But until they can prove that they have lost all
   these parts of their body, I shall say that they cando something for
   Jerusalem, even if they only rememberit! If you cannot preach, you can
   pray! If you cannot pray aloud, you can plead with God in secret! There
   are many who cannot preach, but who can give--and there are others who
   cannot give, who, nevertheless, can speak a word here and there for the
   Lord Jesus Christ! There are plenty of weapons waiting for you if you
   have a mind to wield them. You know what the Israelites took with them
   when they went out to fight the Philistines. They had only axes,
   plowshares and suchlike rough implements, but they seized everything
   that they were accustomed to use on the farm and employed it as a
   weapon of warfare! It is well to know how to use all the implements of
   our service in the house, shop and trade in fighting the Philistines
   and winning victories for the Lord God of Hosts and for His people! So,
   while you are diligent and energetic in your various philanthropic and
   other efforts, I would again whisper in your ear, "Let Jerusalem come
   into your mind."

   Jerusalem should also come into our minds so that we should prefer its
   privileges to earthly gain. Whenever we are about to make a settlement
   in any place and have the choice of residence left to ourselves, the
   first matter we ought to consider is the religious advantages or
   disadvantages. I admire the action of that Jew who, when he was about
   to select a city in which he could pursue his business, asked his
   friend, the Rabbi, "Is there a synagogue in such-and-such a place?" The
   Rabbi replied, "No," so the Jew said, "Then I will not go to live
   there, for I will not settle in any place where there is no synagogue,
   for I must gather with my brethren for the worship of God." I wish
   Christian people always thought and acted in a similar way yet, often,
   for the sake of a trifling gain, they fix their abode where they are
   altogether deprived of the means of Grace! Now, if you should be
   obliged to go live in such a spiritual desert, that is another matter.
   And you should feel that you are sent there on purpose to turn the
   wilderness into a fruitful garden by setting up a synagogue,
   establishing a House of Prayer and so becoming a light in a dark place!
   But, wantonly, and without any objective except that of financial gain,
   to select a residence where there will be no spiritual meat for you
   looks as if you had but slight regard for Christ, or for His Church. At
   such a time, "let Jerusalem come into your mind," and say to yourself,
   "I must go where my soul will be fed, or where I can be the means of
   feeding the souls of others. This must be one of the chief
   considerations in my choice of a place to live--"Can I be of service,
   there, to the Church of God? If not, it is better for me to be useful
   in poverty than to be useless in wealth--better for me to win souls and
   have a struggle for bread, than to rise into the highest position of
   opulence and never have an opportunity of bringing a sinner to Christ."
   Will you kindly think carefully and prayerfully on that matter and, in
   all your settlements in life, "let Jerusalem come into your mind"?

   Once more upon this theme, if you are a member of a Christian
   Church--if you are working for the Church--if you are praying for the
   Church, "let Jerusalem come into your mind" in this way, always act
   consistently with your relationship to the Church I am glad that I was,
   while only a lad, baptized into the name of the Sacred Trinity. Well do
   I remember that May morning when I walked into the river at Isleham
   Ferry and thus declared publicly that I belonged to the Lord Jesus
   Christ! By that act of immersion, I felt that I had crossed the Rubicon
   and there was no possibility of ever going back. I had burned the boats
   behind me so that I could not retreat, nor have I ever wanted to do so!
   It did not matter to me how many spectators looked on me that day, nor
   whether they were angels, men, or devils--I wanted them all to witness
   that, from that day on, I was Christ's servant--that I bore in my body
   the marks of the Lord Jesus, the watermark which could never be taken
   out--that I was dead to the world and risen with my Lord, to serve Him
   forever and ever! And I have often felt, when a temptation has assailed
   me, that it has been a very blessed check upon me to remember that,
   perhaps of all men in the world, I am the most known as having declared
   myself on the Lord's side.

   I do not want to be less known, in that respect, but I feel that I must
   be doubly careful. I must mind how I act, for I have declared, before
   Heaven and earth and Hell, that I am the Lord's! When I hear a young
   person say, "I am afraid to be baptized and to join the Church, for I
   fear that it will be such a bond to me," I ask, "Do you not want to
   have such a bond as that?" Who wants to be free to sin? I do not, I am
   sure! No, blessed Master, if You have another chain, fling it round
   Your servant, for there is no freedom like the liberty of serving God
   and being bound to do so! You remember how sweetly David wrote upon
   this matter--"O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant and
   the son of Your handmaid. You have loosed my bonds"--as if he only felt
   sure of his freedom when the bonds of the Lord were round about him!
   And then all other bonds were gone.

   If you are apt to be very quick-tempered, the next time you are going
   to boil over, "let Jerusalem come into your mind." Be calm and remember
   that you profess to be a Christian--that is, one who is like Christ.
   Then if, in trade, there seems at any time an opportunity of making a
   dishonest penny, stop, stop, stop! "Let Jerusalem come into your mind."
   What will men say about the Church to which you belong if they see that
   you can act as dishonestly as mere worldlings do? This thought ought to
   hold many a man back from doing what he would have done--"The vows of
   God are upon me. I am a Red Cross knight. I have enlisted in the army
   of Christ and it would be shameful for a man who is reckoned to be a
   Christian--called by that most wonderful of all names that comes from
   the Divine anointing of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God--it would be
   shameful for such a man to act as the ungodly would do in the same
   circumstances." No, no, my Brothers and Sisters, wait a while--pull up
   till you have thoroughly considered the whole question. Look at it from
   all points of view and say, with Joseph, "How, then, can I do this
   great wickedness and sin against God?" Oh, that the text and our
   meditation upon it may be a protection to us whenever we are tempted to
   sin! "Let Jerusalem come into your mind."

   II. I have saved a good portion of our time for the second part of my
   discourse which is to be concerning THE JERUSALEM ABOVE WHICH SHOULD
   COME INTO OUR MIND.

   First, let it come into the mind of the Believer. We do not think one
   hundredth as much about Heaven as we ought to. Most people seem to
   imagine we cannot know anything about it and they quote half a text,
   which is almost as bad as telling a lie--"Eye has not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   has prepared for them that love Him." There they stop! But that is not
   where the Scripture ends, for the Apostle went on to say, "But God has
   revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searches all
   things, yes, the deep things of God." They quote the first half of the
   passage to prove that we do not know anything about Heaven, whereas the
   second part tells us that we doknow a great deal about it! And if we
   would but turn our thoughts that way, we might become almost as
   familiar with the inside of the gates of pearl as we are with the
   streets of this clouded, foggy city! We may learn much about Heaven,
   even while we are here, if we are but willing to be taught of God.

   Why should the Christian let Jerusalem come into his mind? I think,
   first, because Jesus is there. A little child, who was dying, expressed
   his intense delight because he knew that he was going to Heaven. And
   one who stood by said, "But, my dear, what makes you wish to be there?"
   His prompt answer was, with flashing eyes, "Because Jesus is there."
   The friend then said to him, "But suppose that Jesus should go out of
   Heaven?" "Then I will go with Him," replied the child, "for He has
   prayed that those whom His Father has given Him may be with Him where
   He is." That is just what we feel! Jesus is the Husband of our
   hearts--should we not think much of the place where He dwells? If a
   wife were banished from her home for a while, I know that she would
   like to look at the portrait of her beloved and at a view of the house
   where she hoped to dwell with him again. And in like manner should your
   thoughts go out to your Well-Beloved while you are, for a time, barred
   from enjoying His company and you should think much of the place which
   He has gone to prepare for you, as He told His disciples, "In My
   Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told
   you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
   for you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself; that where I
   am, there you may be also." Shall Jesus talk like that and yet shall
   not Jerusalem come into your mind? Oh, surely, it shall, for His dear
   sake! Because He is there, our heart instinctively turns that way. We
   watch for His appearing, with our window open towards that Jerusalem,
   looking for and hastening unto the day when He shall come to us! And
   meanwhile, the heavenly Jerusalem comes often into our mind because
   Christ is there.

   Further, the child of God should have Jerusalem upon his mind in all
   his earthly enjoyments. Sometimes God permits His own dear children to
   have many comforts on earth. They are not always in great tribulation
   and then the danger is lest they should begin to love this world and
   the things that are in it. Are any of you, dear Friends, growing rich?
   Are you in good health and strength? Has God surrounded you with
   children? Are you blessed with every joy in this life? Then remember
   that these are the things that make it hard to die unless you have some
   counter-attraction to put side by side with them. "Let Jerusalem come
   into your mind" for, when a man once thinks aright of Heaven, the
   highest joys of earth become very secondary!

   I have heard of a nobleman who lay at the gates of death and his king
   sent him a new title and fresh honors. He was to be a knight of some
   noble order. The nobleman looked at the insignia of knighthood and
   said, "These are fine things for you who are here below and, therefore,
   I heartily thank His Majesty for sending them to me. But I am going to
   another country where distinctions like this have no value whatever."
   So you may say, if you have the comforts of this life, "These are fine
   things, here, and I heartily thank God who gave me all of them in His
   kindness. But I am going to a country where these things are nothing at
   all and, therefore, I will have little or no regard for them. My heart
   is in Heaven-- my heart is not here. My treasure is up yonder and it
   has drawn my heart away up to itself and there it abides." Oh, yes! In
   the times of your greatest happiness, still cling to your Lord! In the
   days of joy as well as in the nights of sorrow, let Him be your
   All-in-All! When God's light fills your sky with sunshine, still love
   Him as much as when you are in the darkness and, according to the
   judgment of the flesh, everything is going ill with you.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, let us equally allow the heavenly Jerusalem
   to come into our mind in poverty and persecution. Ah, then is the time,
   when it is bleak below, to think how blessed are they who are with
   Jesus above! Renwick, the great Scotch divine and martyr for the Truth
   of God, when he was hunted over the mosses and the mountains of the
   land, said to certain faithful friends who gathered around him, "I have
   lain two nights on the bleak hillside and they have been wild and
   stormy nights, and I have had nothing to cover me except the curtains
   of Heaven. And I have experienced the most intense delight when,
   between the times of tempest, I have seen the stars shining in
   Glory--and I have thought how every saint above shall shine yet more
   brightly forever and ever. And when I have thought of the bliss of
   those who are before the Throne of God, I have laughed to think how
   little men can do to hurt any child of God." The good man was right and
   you may say the same as he did if you are hunted by cruel persecutors.
   If you can but maintain fellowship with Jesus, you need not fear them!
   They can but kill the body and afterwards there is nothing more that
   they can do. But, when the glorified spirit walks the streets of gold
   and beholds the magnificence of his everlasting inheritance, he looks
   down on his persecutors and says, "What can you do to me now? I am
   immortal and you cannot harm me! My heritage is up here and you cannot
   take it from me." O you who suffer poverty and persecution, "let
   Jerusalem come into your mind," for this will help you to bear up under
   the greatest trials!

   So, too, should Jerusalem come into our mind whenever we are heavy and
   downcast. Some of the best of God's saints get into that condition. I
   know plenty of Christian people who are not good enough to be
   despondent--I mean that they do not think enough, for, if they really
   did think and meditate, they would soon be partakers of that heaviness
   of which Peter speaks when he says, "Though now for a season, if need
   be, you are in heaviness through manifold trials." I believe that most
   of God's children sometimes get down in the dumps. There is a coal
   cellar to God's house as well as a banqueting hall and, although I
   should like to always live in the banqueting hall, I have many a time
   been down in the coal cel-lar--and I have learned more, there, than I
   have learned upstairs! Well, dear Friends, whenever you get down there
   in the very basement of God's great house, begin to think of the upper
   stories--of those windows of agate and gates of carbuncle that are up
   yonder! Think of how you will lean out of the windows of Heaven to look
   down upon this poor dusky earth. Think of how you will walk up there
   among cherubim and seraphim, familiar with their joyous sonnets--and
   then all the sorrows of your mortal life shall seem to have been but as
   a pin-prick, or "as a dream, when one awakes." Oh, the bliss of being
   able, even when you are despondent, to mount up to Heaven by faith and
   walk with God! Thus, "let Jerusalem come into your mind."

   Further, it is well to let Jerusalem come into our mind in the time of
   bereavement. Who has not lost a friend, a child, a wife, a husband, a
   beloved one of some sort? Well, when you take out your handkerchief
   because the tears flow fast, "let Jerusalem come into your mind." That
   eminent man, Mr. Halyburton, when he was dying so triumphantly--and
   perhaps there was never a death more triumphant than was his--said, "I
   have 10 brothers and sisters, and a father and mother in Heaven, and I
   shall make the 11th of their children when I get there. And this is
   part of the joy that I have in departing, that I shall see my kindred
   before the Throne of God." Yes, your dear infant children--you shall
   see them again! Refrain from weeping, Rachel--you are the mother of
   immortals! True, their little coffins are beneath the ground, but their
   spiritsare not there. Every day they behold the face of our Father who
   is in Heaven! And some of us have parents or grandparents who have been
   called up above. Well, we are following them and we shall be there,
   too, in God's good time! I would that we might be unbroken families
   before the Throne of God--our children and our children's children, all
   gathered there and not one left out! When you linger at the side of the
   silent grave, weep not too much, but "let Jerusalem come into your
   mind."

   I also think it a suitable time to remember this Jerusalem when you are
   growing very old--when the threescore years and ten are over--when you
   have taken out a fresh lease for another ten or a dozen years and have
   almost run that out. Now you are living by the day and are liable to
   have notice to leave at any moment. Well, certainly, now is the time to
   "let Jerusalem come into your mind." There are no furrows on the brows
   of the glorified, no limping limbs, or failing eyes, or closing ears!
   The gray old man shall be as young as a child there! "Then the eyes of
   the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
   Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb
   sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the
   desert." You may well say, "What joy is this to think of Jerusalem!"

   There was a nobleman, who invited good Mr. Foxe, the man who wrote The
   Book of Martyrs, to come and spend a merry Christmas with him, "for,"
   he said, "Mr. Foxe, next Christmas I hope to have such entertainment
   for my friends as you will approve." Mr. Foxe said, "I do believe that
   it will be a high day for me next Christmas, for I shall be where they
   keep holiday forever! What do you think of the state of immortals when
   they quit their bodies?" His lordship was all at sea when Mr. Foxe
   talked to him like that--but so it proved, for Foxe had, by that time,
   gone up to Heaven to see the martyrs whose lives he had written about
   and I know that he did spend his Christmas far more merrily than they
   did in the mansion below! What better thing can happen to you, dear old
   saints, than to get Home to your Father's House? Here you are, as it
   were, left out in the cold for a while, but the great Door will soon
   open and the angel will come to beckon you in. Some who have gone
   before have been watching for you at the gate and you will have a
   joyous welcome! Therefore, when your aches and pains are upon you, and
   all the ensigns of old age are flying, "let Jerusalem come into your
   mind."

   Do the same in times of sickness. And if your sickness should be unto
   death, then all the more, "let Jerusalem come into your mind." I was
   thinking of the little son of a Duke of Hamilton, a long way back, when
   there was graciousness in that family. This lad would, in a short time,
   at his father's decease, have become a duke. He was a very gracious
   child and he was taken away very early. When he was near his end, he
   called his next brother to him and he said to him, "Douglas, in a
   little while you will be a duke, but I shall be a king!" Oh, that is
   blessed for you when you are sure of such glory as that! You might well
   give up a dukedom and go to Heaven in any boat that God might choose to
   send! I would not have any choice about that matter. Some people are
   always dreading sudden death, but, for a Christian, what can be better
   than to die all of a sudden and to go Home when all is right and ready?
   But, anyway, whichever way we go, whether in the swift gondolas of
   sudden death, or in the slower barges of lingering sickness, we shall
   get to port all right--and that is the chief matter, to sail into the
   Fair Havens where we shall abide forever! So, in times of sickness,
   "let Jerusalem come into your mind."

   Now I have to conclude with a word to those who have, at present, no
   part or lot in the New Jerusalem. I should like to be the medium
   through which the still small voice should reach some of you who do not
   yet know the Lord.

   Listen. What if you should never enter the New Jerusalem? Then, say,
   "Farewell," to all the saints, for you will be divided from them
   forever! Say, "Farewell," in your heart to all those blessed ones you
   loved on earth and who, in their death, exhorted you to follow them.
   Take leave of them, for you shall never sit down with them, or see them
   again unless it is from such a distance that there will be no communion
   between you and them, for between them and you there will be a great
   gulf! O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, must I never see your pearly gates and
   ruby walls, and never see the King except to hear Him say, "Depart, you
   cursed, into everlasting fire"? "Let Jerusalem come into your mind." Do
   not be any longer halting between two opinions! If you do not enter the
   New Jerusalem, where else can you go? There is but one other place,
   though even some so-called Protestants, nowadays, seem to be seeking to
   revive a belief in "purgatory"--yet there is no such place!

   I heard of one, the other day, who said to the preacher, after he had
   been preaching according to Christ's Word, the doctrine of everlasting
   punishment, "Sir, I believe that I shall go to Hell for a season, but
   afterwards get round to Heaven." "Man," said the preacher, "even if
   what you say is true, when there is a straightforward road to Heaven,
   what a fool you must be to want to go round by way of Hell!" Yet there
   are still some such foolish folk--they think that they must go round
   about when there is set before them an open door on which is inscribed,
   "Believe and live." There are some who will have no Hell whatever and,
   as I think of them, I am reminded of a story that I heard of a little
   boy, whose uncle had imbibed this false doctrine. The uncle had been
   telling the child the story about the babes in the woods. "Uncle," said
   the boy, "where did the little babies go to after the robins had
   covered their bodies with leaves?" "They went to Heaven, Johnny." "And
   where did their wicked uncle go to?" "Oh, to Heaven, Johnny!" Johnny's
   looked in utter disbelief. "Why, Uncle!" he said, "then he will kill
   the babies again!" Just so, if their natures are not renewed, wicked
   men would do in Heaven the same as they did here! And that cannot be.
   Do you see the folly of such teaching? Christ's message is, "You must
   be born again." You must be renewed in nature. You must come to Christ
   and put your trust in Him, or else, into the New Jerusalem it is not
   possible for you to enter!

   Now, in closing, I want each one of you to ask these two or three
   questions of yourself. "How is my life today in reference to Heaven? Am
   I living so that it would be safe to let me into Heaven? Am I so living
   that it would be possible for God to be righteous and to let me be
   perfectly happy?" Listen to that question and honestly answer it, for
   God will do no unrighteous thing! Neither will He ever marry Heaven and
   sin together. There is an eternal division between those two! Mark the
   next question--"What objection can I possibly have to being saved
   tonight? What reason can there be against my believing in Jesus Christ
   while He bids me do so? It will not make me miserable to have my soul
   saved--it cannot make me unhappy to be made holy! The right way must be
   the best way and the best way must be the happiest way. Christ will not
   refuse me if I go to Him tonight. I have no reason to think that He
   will, but I have every reason to know that He will not, for He has
   said, 'Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out.'" So may it
   be! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 21:9-27.

   Verses 9-22. And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had
   the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,
   saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he
   carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed
   me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from
   God, having the glory of God: andher light was like unto a stone most
   precious, even like ajasper stone, clear as crystal; and had a wall
   great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels,
   and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of
   the children of Israel: on the east three gates; on the north three
   gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the
   wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the
   twelve Apostles of the Lamb. And he that talked with me had a golden
   reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
   And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the
   breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
   furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
   And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits,
   according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the
   building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold,
   like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were
   garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
   jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an
   emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
   chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a
   chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And
   the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one
   pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent
   glass. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
   Lamb are the Temple of it. The less there is of true religion, the more
   there usually is of outward ritualism. When true religion shall fill
   every heart and God shall be the supreme joy of His people, they will
   need no temple.

   23. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
   in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof. Outward means are abolished when their mission is
   accomplished.

   24. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of
   it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it.
   The Church shall be the metropolis of the world. It shall be honored
   and esteemed among the nations of mankind. When men are godly, then
   will they reverence the abode of God, namely, the living Church, built
   up of living stones, upon the one foundation, Jesus Christ!

   25. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
   shall be no night there. There will be no need to shut out enemies at
   night, for the day shall last right on. The Church's most intimate
   communion with God, her constant commerce with the skies, will have
   then begun.

   26. 27. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into
   it. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles,
   neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are
   written in the Lamb's Book of Life. Into this holy city, the graceless,
   the Christless, the faithless shall never come. Here we have a mixture
   of light and darkness, but, in those better days, it shall be all light
   and the darkness shall have fled far away forever.

Girded for the Work

   (No. 2649)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   18, 1882.

   "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind." 1 Peter 1:13.

   WE noticed, in reading the chapter from which our text is taken, that
   the Apostle Peter first mentioned the glorious Doctrines of Grace and
   the marvelous benefits bestowed by God upon Believers and he,
   afterwards, drew from them a practical inference. "Therefore," he said,
   "gird up the loins of your mind." A Doctrine of God may become
   dangerous if it is not reduced to practice--and all the Doctrines of
   God's Word may readily be turned to good and practical account if we
   are willing to so employ them. Those who regard a Doctrine of God
   simply as a subject for debate or an opportunity for displaying one's
   argumentative powers, miss the mark altogether, for we are taught the
   Truths of God in order that they may lead us to holiness of life. This
   is the object of God in giving us more of His Light--that, by that
   Light, we may become more full of the Light of God and be the means of
   conveying His Light to others. Therefore, when your mind is instructed
   concerning some grand Truth of God, after you have sucked the honey and
   joy out of it, always say to yourself, "But what are the bearings of
   this Doctrine upon my life? How should it influence me? What would God
   have me do as the result of receiving such teaching as this?" From what
   Peter had already said, like a true logician, he draws a wise inference
   and says, "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
   to the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ."

   We shall only have time to consider the first few words of the
   Apostle's exhortation, "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind." And,
   concerning them, we will ask three questions, First, What are we to do?
   Secondly, Why are we to do it? And, thirdly, How are we to do it?

   I. First, let us enquire, WHAT ARE WE TO DO? "Gird up the loins of your
   mind."

   The metaphor used by Peter is a very simple one. The garments of the
   Easterns, as you know, are not like ours, but are long flowing robes
   and, unless the raiment is well gird about the wearer, there is little
   or nothing that he can do in the way of active exercise. In a spiritual
   sense, the injunction, "Gird up the loins of your mind," is a very
   proper one to be addressed to those of us who have various loose and
   flowing things which are almost as natural to us as garments are to the
   body. They must be gird about us very tightly or else they will become
   an encumbrance and a hindrance.

   We may possibly understand what is meant by our text if we, first,
   consider the opposite condition. Some persons are notorious for their
   laxity--whatever they have about them is very loosely attached to them.
   I am grieved to say that there are some professing Christians who are
   very lax even in matters of morality. It is a great shame that it
   should be so with any of them and we feel that there must be hypocrisy
   at the bottom of such a state of things as that. Others are very lax in
   their beliefs--they are ready to believe anything or nothing according
   to whatever is said by the last speaker to whom they have listened.
   Some are very lax in their observance of Gospel ordinances. They act as
   though Christ had given them commands which they might obey or
   disregard according to their own pleasure. Nothing connected with them
   seems to be really fastened to them so as to hold them and, for their
   part, they hold nothing firmly--everything is loose and slipping away
   from them.

   Now, I take it that the Apostle exhorts all professing Christians of
   that character to get out of such a state of heart! And I would urge
   you, dear Friends, to do the same. Gird up the loins of your mind as to
   your personal conduct. Be strict about it, not lax! Never fear
   incurring the opprobrium of being too precise. If the name of Puritan
   is appended to you, accept it joyfully as a badge of honor and wish
   that you were more of a Puritan than your assailants suspect! Whoever
   else is lax, you remember that you serve a jealous God and, therefore,
   be very jealous of the honor of His Word, and jealous of the observance
   of His commands, and jealous concerning your whole life. In this sense,
   "gird up the loins of your mind."

   Some professors are ready enough to believe, but they have no intensity
   in their beliefs. They are orthodox as far as they go, but they do not
   go far enough. They have no great concern about religion--they are
   merely tattooed with Christianity. It is only skin deep with them, it
   never gets into their hearts or affects their souls. There are many
   preachers, nowadays, who hold various views of the Truth of God, but
   they hold nothing tenaciously. I have often wished to ask some Broad
   Churchmen if they did not think that the martyrs were great fools in
   laying down their lives in defense of the Truth, for I am sure that,
   according to the teaching of many whom I know, they must regard those
   who were faithful unto death as little better than madmen! I think that
   some of the teachers of the modern school believe that there is no
   Truth of God that is worth a man's dying for. They say that something
   is white, but they add that white is a very, very light shade of black
   if you look at it from a certain standpoint. Another thing is
   undoubtedly black, but that is merely a somewhat darker shade of white!
   Here is a certain Truth which they say they believe, but there are some
   circumstances or conditions in which they do not believe it, so
   practically it is not a matter of faith to them at all. If ever you
   press them too closely upon any point, they always have a back way of
   escape open--in fact, they do not really believe anything at all with
   their heart and soul!

   Now, when religion is held in that fashion, it is tantamount to
   irreligion. If I held doctrines which did not hold me, I should stammer
   in the declaration of them and I could not suppose that anyone else
   would accept them from my halfhearted advocacy. He who has not a fixed
   fulcrum for his lever, whatever machinery he may have, will never move
   the world--and nothing will be accomplished byyou, my Friend, or
   accomplished inyou, unless there are certain Truths of God which you no
   more question than you question your own existence--certain munitions
   of rocks behind which you make your soul's dwelling place and find
   yourself at ease. "The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they
   their houses in the rocks," and they thus prove their wisdom! And when
   a man, whatever his feebleness may be, has certain rocky fundamental
   Truths into which he tunnels so as to hide himself, then he is well
   protected. But all that looseness of which I have been speaking is a
   throwing away of strength. Laxity is the helper of unbelief and tempts
   to all manner of evil the souls of those who are under its malign
   influence.

   Therefore, dear Friends, do not be lax in your belief, but believe what
   you believe. Hold what you hold and know what you know. Do you ask,
   "How can that be?" Well, by being taught of God, for God teaches
   Infallible Truth. What a man teaches himself, or learns from his fellow
   men, may all have to be laid aside, for it is liable to be erroneous.
   But that which God the Holy Spirit burns into his heart and conscience,
   as with a hot iron, shall never be taken from him! You may kill him,
   but you will not take the Truth of God from him. You may cut him in
   pieces, but the man is so joined to the Truth that he cannot be
   separated from it. "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind." Get your
   mental straps tightened up. Bind the blessed Truth of the Gospel more
   closely than ever to your soul!

   Further, this condition of mind to which Peter refers is not only the
   opposite of laxity and looseness, but it is also opposed to that
   effluence, or lack of grip, lack of unity, lack of concentration which
   runs away with the usefulness and force of so many professors. These
   men love God after a fashion and hold His Truth in a way, but, then,
   there are many other things which they love and hold quite as much!
   Their energies run--no, I should say, trickleinto a hundred
   channels--but there is no force in them. If they could all be made to
   flow in one channel, they might rush onward like a torrent and bear
   everything before them, yet it is not so with them, but quite the
   opposite! They are all in pieces. They never get to be one entire man.
   The prayer of David has never been fulfilled in their experience,
   "Unite my heart to fear Your name." They cannot cry with the sweet
   Psalmist of Israel, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I
   will sing and give praise."

   And not being fixed to one point, neither are they united as one
   person. Their condition is exactly described by the Prophet Hosea,
   "Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty." It is a
   blessed thing for a Christian to be strapped up in one bundle and not
   to be divided into a number of separate parcels. "Set your affections
   on things above," is a misquotation that I have heard many times, but
   there is not such a text as that in the Bible. Paul wrote to the
   Colossians, "Set your affectionon things above," that is, have all your
   affections bound up into one supreme, all-embracing affection, and then
   fix it all upon Christ. When the many men within the man become all one
   man and he is, as we say, "all there," and you knowthat he is "all
   there," then he has, indeed, girded up the loins of his mind. May we
   all obey this Apostolic command and earnestly avoid the opposite!

   In trying further to show what our text means, I would say that I think
   the short way of putting it is this, "Pull yourself together." We often
   say, in some great crisis or emergency, "I must, someway or other, pull
   myself together." That is just the meaning of the Apostle here. Do you
   not sometimes find yourself very listless, languid and limp? You hope
   the life of God is within you, but you almost question whether it is or
   not, for it is not vigorous or joyous. You do not seem to take an
   interest in the things of God as you once did. You say, with Cowper--

   "Your saints are comforted, I know, And love Your House of Prayer! I
   sometimes go where others go, But find no comfort there."

   Somehow or other you appear to have fallen to pieces--there is no
   cohesion about you and you are sure that you are not in a right
   condition. Well, then, our text is the very message you need, as it
   means, first, concentrate all your powers and faculties to the service
   of God and the worship of God. Let this be your song--

   "O bless the Lord, my Soul! Let all within me join, And aid my tongue
   to bless His name, Whose favors are Divine."

   "Gird up the loins of your mind," that is, let the Truth of God go
   right around you, so that no part of you is left out of the hallowed
   circle. Be completely contained within the belt of pure and precious
   Truth. Nobody knows what he can really do when he is "all there." The
   capacities of manhood are something terrible when they are turned into
   the wrong channel. Look at a man who goes insane. Insanity is, in some
   senses, a weakness, yet, sometimes, when a man has become insane, he
   has possessed the strength of five or six ordinary men! Now, if we
   could have just the opposite of that--a sanity which nevertheless
   concentrated and increased all the powers of our entire being--what is
   there that we might not be able to do? This is what the Apostle means
   when he urges us to gird up the loins of our mind.

   This expression further signifies not only concentration, but full
   awakening. We are not half-awake, Brothers and Sisters, as a rule.
   Sometimes we are, but when God the Holy Spirit gives us the new Life in
   all its fullness, there is then within us ecstatic joy, firmness of
   resolution, strength of will and a bravery of holy faith that can risk
   everything upon the faintest word of the unseen God. But, oftentimes,
   we need to cry as David did, "Quicken me, O Lord, for Your name's
   sake." In the 119th Psalm, how very frequently that prayer occurs,
   "Quicken You me." The Psalmist was a living man, or he could not have
   prayed to be made alive, but, being alive, he wanted to be made more
   alive. I have told you before of a strange picture which I saw at
   Brussels, in which the artist has represented the Resurrection in a
   very remarkable fashion, showing the people as partly alive. There is
   one man with his head restored to life, but his arms remain as
   skeletons. There is another alive down to his breast, but his legs and
   the rest of his body are still under the dominion of death. It is an
   extraordinary idea, yet I am afraid that there are many so-called
   Christians who are just like that. They have just enough life in them
   for the salvation of their souls, but scarcely enough to make them
   earnest and diligent in the cause of God. Now, Brothers and Sisters, if
   this is the case with you, wake yourself up, pull yourself together,
   "gird up the loins of your mind."

   If you do so, in addition to this concentration and awakening, there
   will be a holy resoluteness about you, an intensifying of any resolve
   that you have made to serve the Lord. Sometimes, you feel, "This is the
   proper time for me to draw near to God, but I really do not feel in the
   spirit for it." Now, pull yourself together and determine that you will
   not allow any of this nonsense! We must pray--and when we feel that we
   cannot pray, then is the time when we must pray more earnestly than
   ever! We are never so much in need of prayer as when we have the least
   inclination to the holy exercise. I delight in preaching the Gospel
   when I am conscious that the Lord is with me, but there are times when
   I have to say, "I do not feel fit for this great task." Whenever that
   is true of any of us, we must hear Peter saying to us, "Gird up the
   loins of your mind." Brother, it is the devil who wants to keep you
   from serving the Savior! He expects that God is going to be with you
   and to bless you, so he tries to unfit you for the service. Then say,
   "By the Grace of God, I mean to do it, and if ever in my life I poured
   out my very soul, it shall be now. Instead of running away from the
   task, I will run to it! Into the very center of the enemy will I rush,
   like David when he said, 'By You I have run through a troop; and by my
   God have I leaped over a wall.'" Oh, for that firm putting down of the
   foot, that steadfast determination that the duty of the hour shall be
   performed and the privilege of the hour shall be enjoyed! We will not
   be drifted from it, or driven from it, or bribed from it! What have you
   and I to do with going to sleep? Those who are children of darkness may
   sleep in the night, but we are children of the day, the Sun of
   Righteousness has risen upon us! So, "let us not sleep as do others,"
   but let us gird up the loins of our mind and, in the name of the Most
   High God, let us resolve not to be found half-hearted and lukewarm, but
   to be wide awake and all-alive in the service of our Lord!

   Still further to explain our text, let me say that it must also mean,
   "Get rid ofhindrances" The Oriental girds up his loins that he may not
   be tripped up by his long flowing garments--and this is the kind of
   thing that acts as a hindrance to a Christian's progress. Not
   hindrances from Satan and the world, alone, but from himself--from
   things about himself that cling as much to him and seem as necessary
   for him as garments are for our bodies. These things will often get in
   the way and trip us up when we are running, or hinder us when we are
   walking.

   When does this happen? Sometimes there creeps over the mind of the
   Believer the thought of security and, consequently, of there being
   little need of watchfulness. There is true security in Christ and that
   sets the mind on its watch-tower. But there is a false security in
   which Satan says, "All is well with you. You are not like these young
   people who have lately joined the Church--you are an old experienced
   Christian--so there is no fear of your falling into temptation. You are
   an old fox, you cannot be caught in the traps of which they will have
   to beware. You may go a great deal further than those young people may,
   and do a great many things which would be dangerous for them, for you
   are all right." When you are deceived by the tempter, you sit down and
   say to yourself, "My mountain stands firm; I shall never be moved." You
   fold your hands and smile with a delusive happiness--under the notion
   that all must go well with you!

   O dear Friends, there is nothing that will lead to stumbling and
   falling sooner than this fancied security! This is, indeed, having
   loose garments! You have special need to watch and pray. Always be
   afraid of that experience which Satan tells you exempts you from the
   necessity of being on your guard, for you are in an enemy's country and
   there is a foe lurking behind every bush! And he alone is safe who
   cries to God, "Hold You me up and I shall be safe." But they who are
   carnally secure are in the very midst of danger. Let us not get into
   that lax and loose condition, but let us gird up the loins of our mind.

   Some are all ungirt and have their garments hanging so loosely about
   them that they are unable to do anything effectively because they are
   continually perplexed with a thousand wandering thoughts. They do not
   think rightly about anything because they think in a loose fashion
   about everything. They never act as do the bees which I have often
   watched. These busy little creatures find the bell of a flower and
   plunge right in till you cannot see them. What are they doing? They are
   getting all the honey that is stored at the bottom of the flower!
   Meanwhile, what has the butterfly done? He has flitted lightly over
   half the flowers of the garden and he laughs at the bee for wasting so
   much time in one flower, yet, at night, the butterfly has nothing to do
   but die, while the bee has been storing her house with sweet nutriment.
   It is a blessed thing when we get right into the bell of the flower of
   the Gospel and are determined to penetrate its secret places to extract
   the delicious essence of the Word, that we may feed thereon and grow
   thereby. It is no use having a brain that is taken up with 50 different
   subjects and yet does not master any one of them.

   There was a class of men called the Encyclopedists, who endeavored to
   gain universal knowledge and, certainly, some of them were prodigious
   scholars. But with you and with me, Beloved, it will be well to call in
   all these wandering thoughts and make the Lord Jesus Christ our
   Encyclopedia, and to determine not to know anything among men save
   Jesus Christ and Him crucified. When you act thus, you have secured the
   choicest honey in all the world, while those who attempt to learn a
   thousand other things may really gather nothing that is worth
   preserving. A man of one book is, after all, the man of power. And the
   man who has but one objective in life--who lives only for Christ and
   lives alone upon Him--is the gracious man whom God will use for blessed
   ends!

   Another loose garment that is likely to trip us up is too much care
   about the things of this world. I think that a man needs, sometimes, to
   hesitate as to whether he should enlarge his business. He may have just
   enough to do to keep going what he already has in hand--and he will be
   able to steal out to the weeknight services and to take his place in
   the Sunday school. But it may be that if he undertakes more
   responsibilities, he will be unable to spare any time for his Lord's
   service. His capital is small, though it has sufficed him up to
   now--but if he tries to make it serve in his larger undertakings, he
   will always be worrying about how he shall be able to meet his
   obligations--and he will be running from pillar to post with a thousand
   anxieties as to how he is to get over his difficulties. Is it not
   amazing that people should be so anxious to get more anxieties? The
   path of wisdom is to try to escape them and, especially as age
   increases, to feel that the last part of our life ought to be
   Sabbatic--it should be a period of rest. Surely, the last seventh of
   our lives, at least, should be a preparation for the everlasting
   Sabbath when we hope to dwell with our Lord forever! It is well for a
   man when he can make it so, but too much to do, too much to think of,
   too much care and too much trouble are very apt to trip up a Christian.
   "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind." Strap yourselves up a bit.
   You know riches take to themselves wings and fly away. One of the best
   things you can do is to clip their wings every now and then--and send
   the feathers round to the College, or the Orphanage, or the Colportage
   Society, or some other good work! In that way you are more likely to
   keep what you now possess and to have a blessing with it.

   Frequently, too, men who do not gird up the loins of their minds are
   tripped up by mental troubles. They are troubled about this and worried
   about that. Things are not according to their mind and, instead of
   doing their best, and then leaving the matter with God, they are
   constantly fretting and fuming. I know some good women who make their
   home utterly miserable by being always in a worry. Often, it is only
   about whether such-and-such a room has been dusted, or whether
   something has been washed. And there are plenty of husbands who go on
   in the same foolish way, for we are all of one race and we are all far
   too anxious to borrow trouble when we have none of our own. Yes, and
   some are very adept at manufacturing troubles! They have a little
   trouble factory at the top of the house and they like to get up there
   and try to make something to be disquieted about. A trouble that God
   sends, He will take away, but if you make it yourself, you may take it
   away yourself. Homemade troubles are just like homemade clothes--they
   do not often fit very well, but they last longer than any others. So I
   warn you against them--the troubles, I mean--pray put them aside! Obey
   Peter's injunction, "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind," and let
   these fancied troubles go to the winds!

   There are others whose loins are not gird up because they are fearful,
   despondent, discouraged in their work for the Lord. Have you not heard
   them moaning in this style--"I do not think I shall ever take my class
   any more." "I do not feel that I can stand up and preach at the corner
   of the streets again." "I do not see how I can give another tract to
   that man--he swore so dreadfully." Come, Brother, "gird up the loins of
   your mind." You need to pull that strap more tightly around you and to
   get your garments well secured. I see that they are beginning to fly
   about in the wind and, if you are not careful, one by one they will
   blow away from you. Be not discouraged! Fear not! Do not despair of
   success! The God whom you serve will not let His Word fall to the
   ground, but you shall see that though you went forth weeping, bearing
   precious Seed, you shall come back rejoicing, bringing your sheaves
   with you!

   I need not go over all the many ways in which a Christian man's
   garments may impede his labors, but our text applies to them all. One
   other meaning of Peter's words, "Gird up the loins of your mind" is, be
   ready, as a man who has his coat buttoned up is prepared to face the
   storm. Be ready for troubles. Be ready for evil tidings. Be ready for
   service. Be ready for suffering, be ready to live, be ready to die.
   Take for your motto the sailors' cry, "Ready, yes, ready," and say,
   "Whatever my Lord's will may be, I, His servant, with my loins gird and
   my staff in my hand, am ready for it." As old Master Trapp says, "Be
   handy with your loins gird about." Have your robes all well fastened so
   that you will not be tripped up by them. Being handy, in this sense, is
   also to be handsome--no man looks better than when his garments are
   well gird about him. When they became loose, they spoil the appearance
   of his figure, but when he keeps himself well prepared for his service,
   then is he beautiful in the sight of his Master who loves to see His
   servant ready for fighting, ready for journeying, ready for whatever
   may happen to him, or be required of him. Therefore, pull yourselves
   together and so "gird up the loins of your mind."

   II. Now, secondly, WHY ARE WE TO DO THIS?

   First, the fourfold character of the Christian life requires it. A
   Christian ought to be at least four things, as well as many others
   which I have not time to mention now. First, he is a pilgrim. He is on
   a journey--he is passing through this world to a better one. How can a
   man travel swiftly and safely unless his garments are properly prepared
   for the journey? And the pilgrims to Zion must gird up the loins of
   their mind if they are to reach their destination.

   A Christian is, next, a racer. He is running in a race and he needs to
   win the crown. He has started for the goal and the prize of his high
   calling is glittering before his eyes. He is the man who must heed the
   command, "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind." How can you run
   with endurance the race set before you if you do not "lay aside every
   weight and the sin which does so easily beset you"? If entanglements
   are to be avoided, the garments of the racer must be tightly gird about
   him.

   Moreover, the Christian is a warrior. How can he overcome his foe if he
   has not put on his armor and is not well clad for the struggle! How
   shall he fight while his movements are impeded by loose garments? You
   know what the old soldier said to the Duke of Wellington when he was
   asked whether he had been at Waterloo. He said that he had and then the
   Duke enquired of him, "Suppose that battle had to be fought again, how
   would you like to be dressed?" The man answered, "If I had to take part
   in that fight again, I should like to be in my shirtsleeves." There was
   great commonsense in that reply and it may teach us a useful lesson. A
   Christian man does not fight well for his Master unless he gets, as it
   were, into his shirtsleeves and takes off all his dignity and
   everything which hinders him from rendering effective service and doing
   the most he can do for Christ.

   Beside being a pilgrim, a runner and a warrior, a Christian is a
   laborer--he is called to work in his Master's vineyard. Now, if a man
   does not gird up the loins of his mind, he will be a very poor laborer
   and will show a very bad day's work when the sun goes down. So again I
   say to you, dear Friends, pull yourselves together! With such holy work
   to do, endeavor to do it at your very best.

   Remember, also, the greatness of your task That should make you "gird
   up the loins of your mind." The Christian life is no child's play. To
   bear testimony for Christ is no trifle and if you wish to win souls, as
   I hope you do, Brothers and Sisters, you cannot do it unless your
   spirit is braced up to the very highest point by the Grace of God. Your
   work is such as might have filled an angel's heart! And it did fill
   your Savior's hands, so see to it that it is done in the best possible
   style.

   The next reason why you should "gird up the loins of your mind" is
   because of the slenderness of your strength You have so little power
   that you cannot afford to waste an ounce of it! If you are ever to
   thresh the mountains, there must be no wasting or throwing away, even
   inadvertently, of any of the little force which you have. If you would
   be mighty, through God, to the pulling down of strongholds, you must
   look well to your spiritual strength and never waste an atom ofit.

   Besides that, remember the readiness of your foes. If they can trip you
   up by laying hold upon a garment which is trailing behind you, they
   will do so. If it is possible for you to be vanquished, you will be
   vanquished, for you have enemies who watch you with eyes full of venom
   and malice because you belong to Christ. Therefore, "gird up the loins
   of your mind" and see that you put not any advantage in their way, or
   they will be quick to avail themselves of it!

   Remember, also, the misery you endure when you are not in a right
   condition. If your minds are not girded up and you feel as I do, you
   must be very wretched. Whenever I feel that I cannot pray as I wish, I
   am very unhappy. When I come here and cannot join heartily in the
   song--well, I have to groan in the chorus someway or other--but I am
   not satisfied with doing that. When I feel at all wandering from God
   and my heart is getting astray from Him, I am not happy, I cannot be!
   Oh, no, blessed be God, when He made us the second time, He made us so
   that we could not rest anywhere but in Himself. Even our first creation
   necessitated our coming to God if we would be blessed, but our second
   creation makes it even more so! If the Lord is with us, we are merry
   all the day long and can praise and bless His holy name. There is no
   fasting for us while the Bridegroom is with us! But if He is once
   withdrawn, then shall the children, even of the bride chamber, fast.
   You know that it is so. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, do not be
   content to be in this sad, loose, lax condition, but, "gird up the
   loins of your mind." May the Lord, in His mercy, enable you to do so!

   III. So I finish with just a few words upon the last question, which
   is, HOW ARE WE TO DO THIS?

   One way is, when you are out of sorts, and out of order, go and confess
   it Go and tell the Lord all about it. Search and see how you got into
   such a condition. Confess the sins that brought you into such a plight,
   then hate them with a perfect hatred. Feel that you cannot continue to
   live in such a state. Cry unto God, "O Lord, do not let me find any
   kind of happiness until I have it from Your own right hand and, until I
   am right with You, give me misery, brokenness of spirit and true godly
   sorrow for sin!" That confession will naturally melt into prayer for
   quickening. While you are mourning your misery, God will help you to
   pray yourself out of it! Never listen to the voice of the tempter who
   says, "Do not pray because you cannot pray," but say within yourself,
   "Now I must pray more than ever. Now I will pray and, however poor and
   broken my prayer may be, such as it is, it shall be presented to God."

   Then, next, while you are on your knees, resolve with energy that the
   evil shall not continue. To make your resolution effective, cry to Him
   who first took you out of the horrible pit and out of the miry
   clay--and set your feet upon a rock and established your goings--and
   ask Him to do that over again in another sense. He will as readily lift
   you up again as He did at the first. If you are willing to be
   half-dead, you may be wholly dead before long. If you are willing to be
   idle and sleepy, the spirit of slumber will steal over you just as if
   all the drugs that poison men had been poured into your soul! If it has
   been so with you to any degree, resolve, with hearty shamefacedness,
   that it shall not be so any longer.

   And then, to help you carry out this resolution, sit down and meditate
   much upon the love of God to you--the eternal love, the boundless love,
   the love that chose you, the love that bought you, the love that sought
   you, the love that fought for you, the love that has worked in you all
   the good things there are in you! And, as you meditate upon that
   wondrous love of God, His Holy Spirit will work upon you. You will feel
   your heart beginning to thaw and the streams commencing to flow as the
   brooks do in the springtime when the icy grasp of winter has been
   relaxed. Therefore, give your heart up to such meditations as are
   likely to stir your spirit and to change its sad condition.

   Then, also try to let your understanding be convinced concerning your
   position and condition. Think much about what the Lord's requirements
   really are. I like to see some passion in religion, but I am much more
   fond of principle. A man may be moved to great zeal and earnestness at
   certain revival meetings--and it is well if he has made the great
   decision--but I am glad if another man has sat down by himself and has
   calmly considered the whole question and, acting upon principle, has
   yielded himself to the Savior. He knows what is true. He knows what he
   is and where he is. He knows what God has done for him and what God
   expects from him and, without any passion or excitement, he steadily
   plods on and continues firmly confident in the Lord.

   One translation of our text is, "Gird up the loins of your
   understanding." Get your understanding tightly strapped up, for, in
   proportion as you know the Truth of God, the Truth shall make you free.
   When you can give to everyone who asks you for it, a reason for the
   hope that is in you, it is better than when you simply say, "I believe
   that I am saved because I am so happy," for, perhaps tomorrow you may
   not be happy--and then you may fancy that you are not saved! That is
   simply going by your feelings and is a most unsatisfactory method.
   Rather say, "I understand, from the Scriptures, that the sinner is bid
   to believe in Jesus. And when he does so, God, Himself, assures him
   that he is saved." Let your religious convictions be founded on good
   sound arguments! Get some "wherefores" and "therefores," so that you
   may have something solid to stand upon. This is the meaning of the
   words, "gird up the loins of your understanding."

   I wish that all who profess to be converted knew what they were
   converted from and what they were converted to-- and what being
   converted really means. I am afraid that a great many jump into what
   they call religion and then jump out of it again. If they only act
   according to the energy of the flesh, they will jump out of it before
   long. He who is converted only by eloquence will be unconverted when
   that eloquence is over. He who is converted merely by excitement is
   likely to be unconverted when that excitement has died away. But he who
   is taught of Godand knows the solid Doctrines of God upon which we are
   grounded and settled, will steadfastly abide in the Truth of God.

   I know that I have spoken all of this for nothing, so far as some of
   you are concerned, because you have nothing for which to gird up your
   mind and nothing with which to gird it. For you, as you now are, there
   is no inheritance. For you there is no place of joy, no hope of peace.
   O poor Soul, first remember that you must be born again, for it is no
   use to gird up the natural man that is unsaved! It is the new man that
   is to be gird about. Your first business is with God and with His
   Christ, and with the eternal Spirit. The first necessity for you is to
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and to accept that Gospel which says,
   "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." That being done,
   then you have something to gird up! God grant it to every one of you,
   for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"--660, 632, 659.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 1:13-20.

   Verse 13. Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
   to the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ This is Peter's practical application of the
   great Truths of which he had been writing. "Look ahead and expect great
   things. Live in the future. Project your thoughts beyond the centuries
   that are passing away into the ages which will never die."

   14, 15. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
   the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who has called you is
   holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation. Remember that you
   can never be really whole till you are holy, for holiness is spiritual
   sanity--it is the caring of the mind and heart from the disease which
   sin brought upon them.

   16. Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy. Children of God,
   be like your Father! Prove that you are His true children by
   manifesting His Character. Let His lineaments be seen in your
   countenance--"Be you holy; for I am holy." The Revised Version is, "You
   shall be holy; for I am holy."

   17. And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons
   judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning
   here in fear Be not presumptuous. Always remember that as there is a
   God who is to judge every man, you are to be judged and oh, that you
   might, through His Grace, be in such a condition of heart that you
   shall stand the last test and be found to be full weight when you are
   put into the balances of the sanctuary which God shall hold with
   steadfast hands!

   18. 19. Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of
   Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. You have seen
   the Character of your Father who is in Heaven. This should urge and
   help you to be like He--holy. Now you see the Character of your
   Redeemer, "a lamb without blemish and without spot." Let this influence
   you to be holy, also.

   20, 21. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
   but was manifest in these last times for you, who by Him do believe in
   God, that raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory, that your
   faith and hope might be in God. It is no use to place them anywhere
   else! All other vessels are too frail to bear such a heavy burden, but,
   if your faith and hope are in God, then you have a security which none
   can destroy.

   22-25. Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
   the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you love one
   another fervently with a pure heart: being born again, not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives
   and abides forever For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man
   as the flower of grass. Thegrass withers and the flower thereoffalls
   away: but the Word ofthe Lordendures forever. And this is the Word
   which by the Gospel is preached unto you. Blessed be God for an
   everlasting Gospel, founded on the Everlasting Covenant, which brings
   with it everlasting life to all those who believe in Christ Jesus the
   Lord!

Characteristics of Christ's Disciples

   (No. 2650)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   16, 1882.

   "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife
   and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life, also, he
   cannot be My disciple." Luke 14:26.

   "Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed Him, If you continue in My
   word, you are My disciples indeed."

   John 8:31.

   "By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for
   one another."

   John 13:35.

   "By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will
   be My disciples."

   John 15:8.

   This morning, [Sermon #1669, Volume 28--Teaching for the Outer andInner
   Circles] I preached upon one of the privileges of the disciples of
   Christ--"When they were alone, He expounded all things to His
   disciples." They formed the inner circle and they had the privilege of
   hearing the expositions and explanations which our Lord gave only to
   His disciples. As I was speaking, I think the question must have arisen
   in the hearts of many of my hearers, "What is a disciple of Chris?" and
   also the further enquiry, "Am I one of His disciples?" It is very
   important for us who are preachers to know what a disciple is, for we
   are bidden to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. What is
   involved in the making of a disciple? We cannot fully answer that
   question until we know what a disciple is!

   In order to help you, dear Friends, to ascertain whether you are truly
   disciples of Christ, I am going to call your attention to four texts in
   which the Lord Jesus mentions some of the things which are essential to
   true discipleship--and without which a man cannot be His disciple. I
   pray the Holy Spirit to make those who are disciples to rejoice in
   their discipleship and to count it the highest honor of their lives to
   have the Son of God for their Teacher and Leader. And I also pray that
   those who fear that they are not His disciples may be brought to Him
   even while I am speaking. May they, by His Grace, resolve that they,
   also, will be His disciples, and may the Divine Spirit conduct them
   into the School of Christ, that they may sit at His feet and receive
   His Word from this time forth!

   I. The first mark of discipleship to which I am going to call your
   attention is mentioned in the Gospel according to Luke, the 14th
   Chapter, and the 26th verse. "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate
   his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes,
   and his own life, also, he cannot be My disciple" These words prove
   that the first requisite of a disciple of Christ is WHOLEHEARTEDNESS.

   The meaning of this passage is that Christ's disciple must so love his
   Lord that, in comparison with the love he bears to Christ, all other
   love shall burn but dimly and be scarcely worthy of even being named!
   This verse has puzzled a great many people because they have supposed
   that Christ really wished them to hate their father, mother, wife and
   so on. The slightest possible thought ought to have convinced them that
   He could never have wished them to do anything of the kind! If you take
   Christ's Words without seeking to find their meaning, you can make
   mischief out of them, for, sometimes, He speaks very boldly--I might
   almost have said, with the utmost reverence, very baldly--in order to
   make His point clear. He speaks in a manner which, in others, would be
   foolishness. He goes beyond what He means us to understand literally,
   because He knows that this is the only way in which He can bring His
   teaching home to some minds. There was really no reason why anybody
   should have made such a mistake and understood these words just as they
   stand in our version. It is not possible for a man to be a disciple of
   Christ if he hates anybody, for the religion of Christ is a religion of
   love--and hatred must be expelled from the bosom of those who receive
   it. It is utterly inconceivable that anybody who hated his father could
   be a disciple of Christ--that would be a violation of the First
   Commandment with promise, which bids us honor our father and mother.
   Certainly Jesus never taught anything contrary to the Commandments of
   His Father! He who hated his own mother would be a monster--not a
   disciple of the meek and lowly Jesus who cared for His mother amid His
   agony on the Cross. Does not nature, itself, teach us that our love
   should certainly flow out to those who were the authors of our being
   and who so kindly cared for us when we were unable to take care of
   ourselves? I am not afraid that any of you, dear Friends, will err in
   that respect and then fancy that you have the warrant of Christ for
   hating your father and mother!

   Then, should not a man love his wife? Yes, that he should, for the
   Apostle says, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
   church." I have heard of one who was said to love his wife too much,
   but I did not believe it, because the model for a husband's love is,
   "even as Christ also loved the church," and who could go beyond that A
   man may be excessively submissive or devoted which, in some cases, may
   have been carried to such excess as to become folly and idolatry, but
   from this evil I hope that we have escaped. But a man could not be a
   disciple of Christ if he literally hated his wife. He would be unworthy
   of the society even of the moral, much more of the society of the
   gracious, if he so acted. Neither can we imagine Christ bidding anybody
   hate his own children. Nature itself dictates that we should love them
   and we do--we cannot help it, nor do we wish to help it. We should be
   traitors to Christ if we tried to expel an affection which He, Himself,
   has implanted within us. No man can hate his children and yet be a
   Christian! It would be a clear proof that he had nothing of
   Christianity about him, just as the Apostle says, of another matter,
   "if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own
   house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel." So, we
   are not to hate our children--nor are we to hate our brothers and
   sisters. It is only in a comparative sense and not literally, that the
   term can possibly be used. And to make this very clear, Christ said
   that we are to hate our own life. The next step to that would be
   suicide and the Savior could never have meant any of His followers to
   commit that terrible sin! What He did mean was that He is to have the
   first place in our hearts and all who are dear to us are to be second.
   Yes, and we ourselves are to be second, too, and are to be prepared to
   break every earthly tie rather than the tie which binds us to Christ
   Jesus our Lord.

   The teaching of the text is that Christ is to be loved more than all
   our relations. It may be that we shall never have to endure the test of
   choosing between Christ and our loved ones, but some have had to do
   that. You have, perhaps, heard the story of the martyr who was going
   out to be burned for Christ. And as his enemies had failed to move him
   from his steadfastness, they made one more attempt to do so as the good
   man was on his way to the stake. They brought out his wife and his 11
   children to meet him and they were all weeping and kneeling down before
   him, begging him to recant. His wife pleaded, "My Husband, be not so
   willful! Do not go to the stake," and each of the children had been
   taught to lay hold of the father and to say to him, "Father, live for
   my sake," "and for mine, Father." This was a trial which the good man
   had not expected and as he stood there, surrounded by his loved ones,
   he said, "God knows how dearly I love you all, and how gladly, for your
   sakes, I would do anything that I may do, with a clear conscience, to
   make you happy. But, compared with Christ and His Gospel, which I love
   with all my heart and soul, I must give you all up and treat you as if
   I had no love for you. I must go and yield up my body to be burned for
   the Truth of Christ. Therefore, do not weep and break my heart." It was
   grandly done on his part and you can probably get a better idea of the
   meaning of my text from that incident than I could possibly convey to
   you by any words that I might use.

   Well, dear Friends, though your faith may never be subjected to that
   supreme test, a matter of life or death, yet you may have to be tested
   to see whether you love Christ more than you love your relatives. There
   was a certain godly bishop who had a brother who came and asked him to
   ordain him and to give him a living, for his trade did not prosper as
   he wished. The good bishop loved his brother and he would have done
   anything that was right to help him. But he said, "My dear Brother, you
   are not called of God to undertake such work, so I cannot ordain you,
   or give you a living. I will gladly give you money to help you in your
   business, but I cannot make use of my position in the church to put you
   into a place for which you are not qualified. Had you been a fit and
   proper person for this holy service, I would have been delighted to
   carry out your wish. But as you are not, I cannot use my influence on
   your behalf in this way." I wish that every bishop would act in the
   same way--they have not always done so. Yet there was the crucial point
   in which the good man felt that he must rather regard the welfare of
   the church than the benefit of his relative and he must treat him just
   as though he had been a stranger. That is how we should deal with
   anyone who comes to us for a similar purpose--if he is a suitable
   person, let him be encouraged to enter upon the work for which he is
   qualified. But if he is not, let him go back to his forge, or to his
   plow, or to his awl, or to his plane, or let him engage in some
   business in which he will be earning a livelihood and doing no mischief
   to his fellow men, as he would do if he were put to work for which he
   is not fitted.

   Have not some of you, dear Friends, met with cases in which the same
   difficulty has arisen? You must either do a wrong to Christ and to His
   people, or else you must appear to be hard and unkind towards some
   relative or friend. Well, you cannot be Christ's disciple if you
   hesitate a minute about what course you shall adopt! Brothers, sisters,
   wife, children, father, mother must never be allowed for a moment to be
   put in competition with Christ! I remember one who, when quite a youth,
   felt that he must be baptized on profession of his faith in Christ, but
   those who were nearest and dearest to him did not agree with him upon
   that matter. He had not one relative who thought as he did concerning
   it. He laid his case before them and, being so young, he asked that he
   might have permission to carry out his conscientious convictions, but,
   at the same time, he said, "If the permission does not come, I shall
   obey My Lord's command, for, in this case, I acknowledge no father or
   mother, but simply do as my Savior bids me." In matters of religion,
   Christ alone is our Leader--and our conscience can never obey any
   supremacy but that of our Lord Jesus Christ. This decision is to be
   announced very gently, without any bitterness of spirit, with much
   humility--and prayer for wisdom and guidance--but there must be no
   question about your action! You are to put your foot down, and say, "In
   everything which concerns Christ and my soul, I call no man, 'father,'
   upon earth, but, at all costs, I must follow my Lord wherever He leads
   me." I think you can now see the drift of the Savior's Words. The rule
   for you who are His disciples must be--Christ first and everybody else
   as far down as you like. Everybody treated with kindness and due
   consideration, but nobodypermitted to usurp the Throne of the great
   King. So, in the first place, we must love Christ more than all our
   relatives.

   And, next, we must love Christ more than life. You know that there have
   been many who have not loved their lives as much as they have loved
   their Lord, for they have freely yielded them up for the sake of Him
   who laid down His life for them. Christians, in past ages, have known
   what was involved in being faithful to Christ. You may have read that
   letter which Pliny wrote, concerning the early Christians, in which he
   said that he knew not what to do with them, for they were men of good
   character, but they had this one peculiarity that they must in
   everything follow Christ. They actually came with calm confidence, even
   to the Roman judgment seat, well knowing that if they were convicted of
   being Christians, they would be put to death--and they seemed as if
   they were eager to die--so anxious were they to put their love to
   Christ before any thought of freedom from pain or escape from death!
   What the torments were, to which they were put, under their many
   persecutors, I scarcely dare to tell you. Think of one of them forced
   to sit in a red-hot iron chair. And of others dragged at the heels of
   wild horses, or tossed to and fro by bulls, or torn in pieces by savage
   beasts. Everything that could add ignominy and pain to death was
   invented in those times--but did the martyrs flinch or turn back? No.
   They stood fast for Christ's sake and threw their lives away as if they
   were worth nothing at all, rather than be found traitors to Jesus
   Christ their Lord and Savior!

   We are to be prepared to do the same as they did, if necessary. Only,
   in our case, probably it will never come to that point in this country
   where, thank God, we have so much civil and religious liberty. Yet,
   often, a similar test may be applied to us in a modified way. There may
   be, for instance, some loss of business through doing what we know to
   be right! There are some persons who have been in the habit of carrying
   on their trade on the Sabbath--but when they have become Christ's
   disciples, they have shut up their shop on that day, and people have
   said to them, "You will be ruined, you will never earn a living. You
   know, we must live." I have often heard that last little sentence, but
   I do not believe it. I do not see any necessity for us to live. There
   isa necessity for us to be true to Christ, but not for us to continue
   to live! It is a great deal better that we should die than that we
   should do a wrong thing. And we should be prepared at any time to say,
   "If necessary, we will let our trade go and we will be poor. But we
   will keep a clear conscience." And he who has that little bird in his
   bosom will never lack for music! And though he has scarcely a penny in
   his pocket, yet if he wears the flower called heart-sense in his
   buttonhole, he need never envy the richest man in the world!

   It may happen to you, in your business, that there will be an
   opportunity of getting money by being thieves in a respectable kind of
   way--there are plenty of such thieves about. But if you are a
   Christian, you will say, "No, money gained by dishonesty will carry a
   curse with it. I cannot touch it any more than I would handle
   blood-money. If it comes by any wrong method, I must leave it alone,
   for pelf and wealth shall not come to me if they cannot come honestly.
   I must and will serve the Lord Jesus Christ first and foremost."

   Sometimes you know that for Christ's sake, our Brothers and Sisters go
   as missionaries to India or China, and some go to the Congo or to other
   stations in Africa where it is almost certain that, in a short time,
   they will be cut down by the fever. But how brave it is on their part!
   How truly a disciple of Christ is such a man or such a woman, who,
   knowing all that may be expected, nevertheless says, "My Lord calls me
   to serve Him in Africa. And if He sends me to a mangrove swamp and to a
   fever, I will as readily go there for Him as if He summoned me to sit
   upon a throne."

   To sum up the teaching of this first text, it means that Christ is to
   be loved more than anything. If this were the choice set before us--the
   whole world, or Christ--thank God there are many of us who would not
   wait a minute for the decision! And if this were the choice--shame in
   the eyes of men, or else the far greater shame of deserting the Savior,
   oh, I hope we would not hesitate even for an instant! "No," says the
   Christian, "Christ is my All-in-All. If I have all things, I will try
   to find Him in them and if I have nothing, I will find all things in
   Him." So the meaning of this text is that Christ must have wholehearted
   servants and if you come to Him to be His disciples, you must bring
   your whole being with you. Christ will never be King over a divided
   manhood. There was a time when this island was a heptarch and seven
   little kings ruled over it. But now we have but one sovereign and in
   this united realm we never shall have but one supreme ruler. So should
   it be in man's heart. The devil is quite willing to share the kingdom
   with Christ. "Oh," he says, "let Christ reign and let mereign, too! We
   shall make an excellent pair to rule over men." But Christ will not
   have it so. If we are to be His subjects, He will rule over us from the
   crown of our head to the soles of our feet, and He will not permit
   Satan to have a single stronghold within us that he can call his own.
   Out you must go, you vile usurper, for He has come who is King of Kings
   and Lord of Lords! The crown sits upon His brow, nor will He allow a
   rival even for an hour! Come, then, Beloved, what do you say? Are you
   wholehearted for Christ? If not, you are not His disciples. Listen
   while I read our first text again, and as I do, you read into it the
   true and full meaning of the words and feel their force. "If anyone
   comes to Me, and does not hate his father and mother, wife and
   children, and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life, also, he
   cannot be My disciple."

   II. The second requisite for being a disciple of Christ is found in the
   8th Chapter of the Gospel according to John, at the 31st verse--"Then
   Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you continue in My word,
   you are My disciples indeed." So CONTINUANCE is the next trait in the
   character of a true disciple of Christ.

   There are a great many persons who, like those Jews, profess to believe
   in Jesus Christ for a time. When opposition and persecution came, they
   deserted Him and so proved that they were not really His disciples. I
   do not know much about the merits of the question, which is often
   discussed in the papers, with regard to enlistment for a short or a
   long term of service in the Queen's army, but I know that my Lord and
   Master will not accept any of you unless you enter His army for
   life--no, more--for all eternity! In Christ's true Church there is no
   profession of faith merely for a time. Once you have made it, you have
   made it forever. The very way of confessing Christ, which is by
   Baptism, signifies this, for the man who is rightly immersed into the
   name of the Sacred Trinity is first buried and then he rises again--and
   that burial, having once taken place, can never be cancelled--whatever
   happens, it is an accomplished fact. Then, again, the act of immersion
   can never cease to be a fact. Marks made in the flesh may be removed,
   but when the watermark has been put upon the whole body, it can never
   be removed. He who has been buried with Christ may have been a
   hypocrite and a deceiver, but, notwithstanding his hypocrisy and
   deception, he has passed through the outward form of the ordinance and
   he can never clear himself from the responsibility of it. It will be to
   his everlasting disgrace if he is a baptized reprobate! At the Day of
   Judgment it shall be conclusive evidence of his guilt that he either
   tried to deceive himself, or deceived God's people and made a mockery
   of the ordinances of Christ. But in the case of a true believer in
   Christ, continuance in the right road proves him to be a Christian.

   First, we are to continue believing Christ's words. Whatever new
   doctrinal errors may spring up, we are to take no notice of them, but
   just continue in the faith of Christ. Then shall we be His disciples
   indeed! In these evil days, some new heresy appears nearly every week.
   There are some people who seem to spend all their time in inventing
   lies and these, joined to the old errors that are continually being
   vamped up, puzzle those who are not well established in the faith so
   that they scarcely know what is orthodox doctrine and what is
   heterodox. But he who keeps close to his Master, sits at His feet and
   learns of Him--when he is taught of the Spirit--and holds fast what he
   has received. Mr. Whitefield used to say that in his day there were
   some persons for whom it was impossible to make a creed. He said, "You
   might as well try to make a suit of clothes for the moon, for they
   change as frequently as she does." And we have many people of the same
   sort in our day! They are "everything by starts, and nothing long." But
   that is not a characteristic of Christian discipleship! A man is not
   Christ's disciple if he is "tossed to and fro, and carried about with
   every wind of doctrine," allowing anybody to put an oar into his boat
   and turn and twist him wherever the intruder pleases. No, the Master's
   message to His followers is, "If you continue in My word, you are My
   disciples indeed."

   But we must also continue in obedience. It is the part of a true
   disciple of Christ to do his Lord's will in the teeth of every
   temptation that may assail him. You will not be obedient to Him very
   long without being pulled by the coat, first this way, and then that.
   But the true disciple of Christ says, "If all the kingdoms of this
   world were to be given me on condition that I would fall down and
   worship the god of this world, I would not, for an instant, thinkof
   doing so, for I am enlisted in the army of the Cross. I serve the Lord
   Christ and Him alone."

   And we are also to continue in Christ's word when we are in affliction.
   There are, alas, some who, if God seems to treat them roughly, grow
   mightily offended with Him. A dear child is taken away from their
   family circle and they say that they will never forgive God. They have
   trouble upon trouble and straightway they complain that God behaves
   evilly to them--and they are ready to turn back at the first crossroad
   that they come to in their pilgrimage. But this will not do for those
   who would be "disciples indeed." We must hold on, come fair or come
   foul, and this must be our motto, one that I have often quoted to you
   and one that I love to think of myself--"Though He slay me, yet will I
   trust in Him." We have committed ourselves to Him as unto a faithful
   Creator. We have lifted our hand in token of our allegiance to Him, and
   we cannot go back!

   Dear Friends who have just lately been converted to Christ, let me
   exhort you to be steadfast and immovable! You cannot be Christ's
   disciples unless you are firm and decided. A Christian soldier who had
   to sleep in a tent with some ungodly comrades, knelt down at night to
   pray and every time he did so, he was assailed by all sorts of
   missiles. He consulted the chaplain as to what he had better do and
   that time-serving individual said he thought, perhaps, it was not
   necessary for the soldier to kneel down publicly before he retired to
   rest. The soldier tried the cowardly plan for one night, but he was
   very unhappy and his conscience was troubled about it. He had failed to
   bear testimony for Christ, so, the next night, he knelt down as he had
   done before and it pleased God that, by degrees, the opposition ceased
   and, more than that, the influence of his brave example and the words
   he spoke at different times, brought all the other men in the tentto
   kneel down, too, before they went to rest! Whether they were all
   converted or not, I cannot tell, but, at any rate, there was at least
   the form of prayer in that way. When the soldier saw the chaplain,
   again, and told him what had happened, the chaplain commended him, and
   then the soldier asked him, "Don't you think it is better for us always
   to keep our colors flying?"

   That is a good watchword for you, Beloved--Always keep your colors
   flying! There are some professors who say, "We can carry our flag
   wrapped up in a waterproof case and when there is a favorable
   opportunity, we can let it fly in the breeze." No, no! It is best to
   keep your colors always flying. There may be danger and difficulty
   through flying the flag, but a hundred times worse danger comes from
   rolling it up and putting it away out of sight. Never be ashamed of
   what there is no reason to be ashamed of! If any man is ashamed of
   being a Christian, surely Christ has cause to be ashamed of him! Let it
   not be so with you, dear Friend, but rather let each one say--

   "Ashamed of Jesus? That dear Friend

   On whom my hopes of Heaven depend?

   No! When I blush, be this my shame--

   That I no more revere His name." But, as to blushing when I acknowledge
   that I am His servant, may never such a crimson token of shame come
   onto my cheek! So stand fast in the faith, Beloved, for thus shall you
   prove that you are, indeed, Christ's disciples.

   III. I must now pass on to a third mark of a genuine disciple of
   Christ, that is, BROTHERLY LOVE. Kindly look at the 13th Chapter of
   John's Gospel, and the 35th verse--"By this all will know that you are
   My disciples, if you have love for one another."

   This is to be a mark of discipleship which all men can see. Whenever
   there is genuine love among Christian people, everybody knows at once
   that they are Christ's disciples. Good men and bad men--the most
   ignorant and the most foolish men cannot help seeing that love is, as
   it were, a sign hung out as a mark of the business done within. That
   disciple whom Jesus loved, wrote, "Beloved, let us love one another;
   for love is of God; and everyone that loves is born of God, and knows
   God. He that loves not knows not God, for God is love."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, how are we to love our brethren so as to let
   all men know that we are Christ's disciples? One ready way is by
   considering their needs and doing the best that we can to help them out
   of their difficulties. If we say to the cold and the hungry, "Be you
   warmed and be you filled," and yet do nothing practically to help them,
   how dwells the love of God in us? What kind of Christianity is that
   which is liberal only in words Dear Friends, there are many poor people
   among us who are struggling to get a livelihood and, alas, there are
   many others who cannot find any employment at all. And it is incumbent
   upon any who are being prospered by God to help their poor brothers as
   far as they can. Very often a man can truly help his fellow, even
   though he has no money to spare. I read a pretty story of a Cornish
   miner who was getting rather old and the captain of the mine said,
   "John, I think that I can put you into an easier berth than the one you
   now hold. You will get more money and you will have to be an overseer
   of others rather than to do much yourself. I know that I can confide in
   you, so I will put you into that place next month." The miner said, in
   reply, "Captain, do you know our brother Tregony?" "Yes," answered the
   captain. "You know that he is older than I am," said the miner. "He
   cannot do a day's work, now, and I am afraid that he will have to give
   up altogether. I wish you would let him have that berth because, though
   I am getting old, I think that I can keep on for another year or two.
   So let old Tregony have the overseer's position."

   The captain did so and that is true Christian love when a man is
   willing to make a sacrifice because he feels that he is not quite as
   much in need as another. I remember saying to a poor widow who came one
   morning to the Orphanage with her child, "There is another woman
   outside. You have been talking to her, have you not, while you were
   waiting to come in?" "Yes, Sir," she answered. I said, "She has nine
   children and we can only take one. How many have you?" "Three," replied
   the woman. "Well, now," I asked, "which of those three shall we take?"
   "Oh, Sir!" she said, "there is not a minute needed to deliberate about
   it! You take one of that other poor woman's children. I will try to do
   the best I can, though it is a hard pinch for me, but that woman has a
   heavier burden to carry than I have, poor thing." I was pleased to see
   such a spirit of self-sacrifice and I am always glad when Christian
   people feel that kind of sympathy and love for one another. How often
   might rough roads be made more smooth if all acted like that! This is
   just what we must be constantly doing, for we cannot be Christ's
   disciples unless we have love for one another.

   Beside that, we can show our love to our brethren by bearing their
   faults. It is a grand thing to be able to put up with a good deal.
   There are some people who seem to think that they have come into the
   world that other people may put up with them--and they certainly do
   play their part, for they give other people plenty to put up with! And
   if anybody should in the least resent it, they say, "So-and-So is out
   of temper with me." I was going to say that an angel might be out of
   temper with some people, but I do not suppose that he would. Still, I
   wish that these people would remember the provocations they often give
   as well as the sharp retorts they sometimes get. "Oh," says one, "I do
   not believe that there is any love among Christians." Brother, you are
   measuring our corn with yourbushel! You see that you have not any love
   in your heart, for, if you had, there would be some love in your eyes
   and you would perceive some, also, in others. But when it is clean gone
   out of your own soul, you suppose it must also have departed from
   others.

   Of course, you do not admit that it has gone out of you and you imagine
   that you see outside of you what is really inside, so, when you say
   that there is no love anywhere, it is because you are looking at
   yourself in the mirror, that is all. But we who love the Lord can, I
   trust, bear with one another. I sometimes try to think which is the
   greater wonder-- that you, dear Friends, have put up with me so long,
   or that I have put up with you! There are some of you who are the best
   people in the whole world and there are others of you who are not the
   best, but rather the reverse, and some of you do cause us trouble
   sometimes. Well, may God give all of us great patience and may we
   believe in one another! That is half the battle in all the difficulties
   that arise among Christians--that we should not impute wrong motives to
   our fellows, and not be ready to bring accusations against one
   another--but just believe that each of our fellow members is a child of
   God and if there is something which he has done, and which looks wrong,
   say, "It must have been misrepresented or misreported. I am sure it
   must--he cannot have done such a thing. I will stand up for him. He is
   my Brother-in-Christ, so I will defend him."

   There is one other point in which some of you may exercise love for one
   another and that is, in rejoicing in each other's happiness. This is a
   point which is far too often forgotten. You know the tendency among
   men--here is a man who is rising in the world, so there are many who
   say, "Ah, humph!" They do not say anything more, but they shrug their
   shoulders and they look full of unutterable things. Or there is a
   Brother who has done well in the Church and he is referred to in terms
   of approbation. Then at once somebody begins to try to pull him down
   and says, "Ah, yes! I could have done what he has done." Then why did
   you not do it? "Oh, but he had such great advantages!" Yes, perhaps he
   had, and you also have had opportunities of doing something or other,
   but you have not made the best use of them. Now, instead of being
   jealous of our Brother's success, ought we not rather to be rejoicing
   in one another? If a man is poor, let him rejoice that everybody is not
   as poor as he is! If he is troubled about his worldly circumstances and
   he meets with a Brother who has no cause for such sorrow, let him say,
   "I am glad he is better off than I am. I do not want him to have
   anything to worry him as my troubles perplex me. I praise God for his
   prosperity, I bless the Lord for his happiness." Then when we see an
   especially gracious and gifted man coming into the Church and serving
   God, let us welcome him heartily and say to one another, "Here is a
   true comrade for us and we are glad that God has sent us such a man to
   help us in His work."

   I wish that we were all of the mind of that noble Spartan who wished to
   be a magistrate, but another man opposed him and received twice as many
   votes as he did. What did the Spartan say? "I am grateful that the
   country has better men than myself and I am glad to see that it knows
   where to find them when it needs them." So, dear Friends, be glad when
   God provides better men than you are to do His work. Let the preacher
   rejoice when another preacher excels him. That is the point to which we
   must all bring ourselves. Let the Sunday school teacher praise the Lord
   when she finds another teacher who altogether eclipses her. What a
   blessed thing it is for the Bible class teacher who has a large company
   around him, to find another Brother raised up who gets a better class
   than his has ever been! Bless God when it is so, dear Friends. This is
   one of those points that is often difficult, but it ought to be
   easy--and it would be easyif we had love for one another! And if we
   have not such love, we are not Christ's disciples.

   IV. I must close now with just a few remarks about the last
   characteristic of a disciple of Christ. It is mentioned in the 15th
   Chapter of John's Gospel, at the 8th verse--"By this My Father is
   glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples." So
   the last mark of a disciple is that of FRUIT-BEARING.

   What is bearing fruit in this sense? Well, first, it is doing service
   for Christ He said to His disciples, "He that abides in Me, and I in
   him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without Me you can do
   nothing," plainly implying that the fruit which is to come from abiding
   in Him will be seen by our doing something for Him. Christian men and
   women, the Lord Jesus Christ does not want to have any followers who
   never foil or fight for Him! He does not wish to have with Him
   shepherds who never feed His flock--merely nominal Christians who never
   do anything for Him. Does this touch any of you? Some of you come in
   here, Sunday after Sunday, and you sit and enjoy my ministry, but you
   do not help in the Sunday school, you do not distribute tracts, you do
   not preach, you do not do anything! How can you be Christ's disciples?
   I suppose you are like some officers of whom I have read, who draw
   large salaries because they are such distinguished ornaments to the
   service. It is a great honor to have these people in the army, though
   they never saw a sword drawn except on review days. So, no doubt, it is
   a very fine thing to have a number of Church members who are simply
   ornamental persons--they swell our numbers when they are counted with
   us and people say, "They are so very respectable that they help to make
   us all respectable."

   Well, now, to tell you the truth, we do not care an atom about your
   respectability! We think that the most respectable person in the
   world--that is, the person who most deserves to be respected--is the
   one who is doing something! He who does nothing deserves to be starved,
   even as the Apostle Paul said, "This we commanded you, that if any will
   not work, neither shall he eat," which is much the same thing as
   letting him starve. Let us try to be fruit-bearing disciples by doing
   all that we can for Christ, because, if we do not bear fruit, we cannot
   be His disciples.

   Next, fruit-bearing will be proved by our prayers. Notice the words of
   our Lord--"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask
   what you will and it shall be done unto you. By this My Father is
   glorified, that you bear much fruit." Prayer, then, is a blessed fruit
   of Divine Grace--prayer for others, prayer for Christ's Church, the
   prayer that brings down unnumbered blessings from above. Many a sick,
   bed-ridden saint who cannot speak and who can scarcely lift her hands,
   can lie there and do great things in prayer! Joan of Arc was not half
   so mighty as that poor invalid! She is the King's true warrior! While
   she lies there apparently helpless, she is commanding the legions of
   Heaven by her invincible petitions! See, then, dear Friends, that you
   bear much fruit in earnest, prevailing prayer!

   Another method of fruit-bearing is by a holy character. O Beloved, I
   implore you to be holy men and women! Seek after close conformity to
   the likeness of Christ. Nothing does more good for a Church than for
   its members to live the Gospel in all their concerns at home and
   abroad.

   But I think that we shall not bear fruit as we should unless we
   endeavor to bring converts to Jesus. Dear mistress, seek to win the
   soul of your little maid! Good master, employing so many hands, get
   them together, sometimes, and talk to them about your Savior--and pray
   that He may be theirSavior, too. Can you do it? There ought not to be
   one barren member of this Church. Everyone ought to be able to feel
   that when he comes before God at the last, he shall be able to say,
   "Here am I and the children You have given me." For this let us live!
   For this let us labor! If we do not, we cannot be Christ's disciples.

   I remember one who never did anything for Christ and when somebody
   spoke to him about his lack of fruit-bearing, he said that he bore
   insidefruit. I never heard that idea before, so I turned it over in my
   mind and, the next time I met him, I said to him, "Are you still
   bearing inside fruit?" He answered, "Yes." "Well," I said, "we shall
   never get at it till you are cut down." Fruit is evidently intended to
   be an outside thing that is borne for the benefit of others! So, in
   this respect, Brothers and Sisters, see to it that you are fruitful by
   rendering all possible service to our Lord and Master.

   The real application of my four texts is this--Are you, dear Friends,
   Christ's disciples? Let that question be passed around and let these
   four marks help us to judge ourselves--are we distinguished from those
   who are not Christ's disciples by our wholeheartedness, continuance,
   brotherly love and fruit-bearing? May all these things be in us and
   abound. And if we have none of them, may we apply to Christ for them!
   Lie at His feet. Confess your sin and then look up, believe in Him and
   live forevermore! The Lord bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

The Christian's Service and Honor

   (No. 2651)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 3, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A LORD'S-DAY EVENING IN THE
   AUTUMN OF 1857.

   "If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor." John 12:26.

   FEW men love service. Man prefers to be his own master, to do as he
   pleases according to "his own sweet will" and, like the winds, to be
   under no control whatever. But he who spurns the counsel of God,
   despises His Law and tramples on His commands, commits an act of
   suicide to his own liberty! Those who act thus, while they seek to be
   free, become the truest slaves, for, when they give a loose rein to
   their lusts, they find them like wild horses dragging them irresistibly
   along. Passions indulged turn into habits--and those habits hold them
   fast in their iron grip and they cease to be free any longer. He is the
   freeman who serves God and not the man who scorns the yoke of Jesus. He
   is the freeman whose shoulders bear the yoke of Christ. But he who
   refuses to serve Him is a slave. He who will not obey Jesus, obeys a
   tyrant master called Satan, or worse still, himself, for, after all,
   the greatest tyrant to a man is his own sinful self! There is no
   slavery harder to endure than the despotism of evil habits when they
   have grown strong upon a man and fixed their chains upon his neck. The
   service of Jesus is perfect liberty--those who wear the collar of Jesus
   find it to be a royal badge which makes them far more honorable than
   would the Order of the Garter, or the Bath. There is nothing that can
   so exalt a man as to make him a servant of Jesus! And the man who bends
   his neck willingly to serve Him, manifests the greatest wisdom.

   What is it to serve Jesus? The text says, "If anyone serve Me, him My
   Father will honor." Well, we can serve Him in the faith that we hold,
   in the sufferings we endure and very much in the acts we perform.

   First, we can serve Him in the faith that we hold. This is true
   service. I believe certain Doctrines of God because God says they are
   true--and the only authority I have for their truth is the Word of God.
   I receive such-and-such Doctrines, not because I can prove them to be
   compatible with reason--not because my judgment accepts them--but
   because God says they are true! Now this is one of the best services we
   can render to God--to submit ourselves to Him in our belief of what He
   has revealed and ask Him to fix His Truths in our hearts and make us
   obey them. There are some who have an idea that doctrinal belief is
   nothing, but I tell you again, one of the highest services we can
   render to God is to fully believe in the Doctrines of His Word. So far
   from doctrinal error being a thing of no moment, it is a great sin
   because the Word of God is plain--and he who does not, by searching,
   discover the Truth--sins against God in the proportion in which he errs
   from His Word. But he who manfully proclaims the whole Truth of God and
   he who heartily receives it, alike, obey God and perform one of the
   highest services that can be rendered to the Most High!

   Secondly, we honor Him, also, when we suffer for His name's sake. When,
   with patience, we bear the fires of persecution. When, with calmness
   and resignation, we listen to the lies and calumnies that fly abroad.
   When we continue in welldoing though all manner of evil is said against
   us on account of our devotion to Jesus, then we serve Him and God is
   thereby honored and glorified. Our Lord Jesus bids us, in that day,
   rejoice and leap for joy, for great is our reward in Heaven, for so
   persecuted they the Prophets who were before us. And, moreover, when
   our suffering does not spring from our enemies, but when God, Himself,
   lays us on the bed of affliction, we honor Him when, worn with pain and
   tossed from side to side, we are calm and patient under the sickness
   and say--

   "Father, I wait Your daily will--

   You shall divide my portion still.

   Grant me on earth what seems to You best,

   Till death and Heaven reveal the rest"

   The patient bearing of poverty is a service to God. The calm endurance
   of pain is honoring the Father--submission to His will in all the
   proceedings of His Providence is the very essence of devotion.

   Thirdly, we can serve God in the outward acts we perform. And that is
   the highest form of service. Indeed, if we do not serve God thus, we do
   not really serve Him at all. "If anyone serve Me, him My Father will
   honor," says Christ. And, in proportion as a Christian man serves God
   in his outward life and conversation, shall he receive honor of God.
   There are two or three ways of doing that. Some may serve God by the
   performance of ecclesiastical duties, as they are called. Others, by
   the more private duties of religion. But others, and more frequently,
   by the acts of daily life. Those who preach the Gospel from love to God
   and for His Glory, serve Him, and shall be honored in their labor. The
   deacon who toils for the Church of God is serving Him, and shall be
   blessed in what he does. The Sunday school teacher serves God. And each
   of you who have been preaching in the open air, or have, in smaller
   places of worship, been testifying to the Truth of God and now have
   come here to take the rest which all tired soldiers need--each of you
   who have been engaged in humbler work, teaching a little class, or
   giving away a tract--you have each and all, in some measure, served
   God!

   But if you have not served God in this way, today, you can serve God
   tomorrow in your shop, or in your family. The servant can honor God
   even when she sets the things out for the daily meal and when she
   clears them away. The nurse can serve God when, with tender hands, she
   binds up the wounds of the distressed and suffering. And the merchant,
   also, when he makes honesty the law of his dealings and afterwards,
   with a liberal hand, dispenses some of his goods to feed the poor. Do
   not think it is necessary to be a clergyman and wear a gown in order to
   serve God--you may serve Him behind the counter, at the plow, or
   driving your horses! Whatever your hand finds to do may be done to the
   Glory of God! Common actions reveal the essence of true piety. Those
   things which we call common, God does not think so. When they are done
   with a right motive and in a right spirit, they become as great, in
   God's sight, as the sermons of the minister who preaches to the largest
   audience! And I take it that there will be people before the Throne of
   God, who, for acts which they have done in private, will be stationed
   nearer to the Savior than some of those who occupied very high
   positions in the Church! They went foremost in the day of battle and
   received great applause from men, yet, God knows that they were not
   one-half so faithful to their Savior as the poorest cottager, or the
   meanest peasant who, for the good of souls, and the Glory of God, bent
   his knees before the Lord in earnest and believing supplication.

   I cannot enlarge upon these points. You must think over them when you
   get home. You may serve God in the belief of His Doctrines, in
   suffering the dispensations of His Providence and in obeying all His
   Commandments, not forgetting the Commandment concerning Believers'
   Baptism. Now I come to the subject of my discourse, in our Savior's
   declaration--"If anyone serve Me, him My Father will honor," from which
   I learn that God will honor him in this world, in the future and
   intermediate state, at the Day of Judgment and throughout eternity!

   I. GOD THE FATHER WILL, EVEN IN THIS WORLD, HONOR THE MAN WHO SERVES
   THE SAVIOR!

   Some of you look at me with astonishment and are ready to say, "That is
   not true! God does not, as a rule, honor His servants in this world. It
   is a notorious fact that those who serve God best receive the most
   dishonor in this world, that those who are the most valiant for the
   Truth of God are called upon to endure the largest share of ignominy!
   Instead of the greatest honor, they have the most of the world's
   hisses, derision and scorn." Yes, I know that "the friendship of the
   world is enmity with God" and that if any man will be a friend of God,
   he will generally be an enemy to this world. But yet, for all that, the
   servants of Christ do receive respect and reverence even in this
   time-state.

   I remark, first, that Christ's servants receive honor in the Church.
   Any man who serves God faithfully will be sure to be honored by the
   Lord's true servants. Let him preach the Truth fearlessly, fully,
   earnestly and heartily, and he need not be afraid that he shall not be
   honored by his Brothers of the Church, for the good will assuredly
   rally round him and not be backward in showing respect to him. Nor, if
   he toils in the Sunday school, shall he be without honor. Nor will he
   lack it, if he is but a humble member of the Church, if he is only
   seeking to glorify his Lord. Just in proportion as each one serves God
   will he be honored!

   I deny the statement which is made, sometimes, that honor is not given
   to those members of Churches who do not happen to occupy what is called
   a "respectable position in society." I believe that if an examination
   were to be made into the conduct of the affairs of this Church, for
   example, it would be proved that the greatest honor is given to those
   who work most for God. There are, I am sure, some of our members to
   whom we all look up with respect and reverence, though they are not men
   of position or wealth. But they have something more and something
   better--they have the love of God in their hearts and they manifest the
   effect of that love in their lives--and that makes them most honorable!
   And putting this Church as the representative of all Christian Churches
   in this matter, I may say that the poor man, in his efforts to do good,
   will be honored equally with the rich! No distinction is made by God on
   account of rank or estate, but each one is honored according as he
   loves and serves the Savior. If respect is shown to the rich as well as
   to the poor-- and why should the poor be honored and the rich
   despised?--it is not because of his worldly wealth, but because he is
   also rich in faith! A rich man's soul is as good as the poor man's, and
   the poor man's soul is as good as that of the rich-- and when the poor
   man labors for Jesus as well as the rich man, they will alike receive
   honor!

   I believe it is so among us here and trust that it will continue to be
   so in all time to come. At any rate, as long as this arm can strike a
   blow against the spirit of social bigotry, it shall be driven from our
   midst! We do not admit any thought of caste among us and I am
   constrained to believe that the general practice, in all our Churches,
   is to reverence men according to their usefulness. Do not imagine,
   then, that you are debarred from any position in the Church, or from
   any of the honors of your Brethren because you do not happen to be
   rich. The Church will honor those who serve the Lord and so will God,
   Himself, for Jesus said, "If anyone serve Me, him My Father will
   honor."

   But, next, those who serve Christ will also receive honor from the
   world. The world itself honors the Christian. You say, "How can that
   be? I am the subject of the laughs, the jeers and the ridicule from
   morning to night! I am called 'a canting Methodist,' or something of
   that sort. And I can't think, therefore, that I am honored by the
   world! I feel rather that I am dishonored." But you are honored, after
   all, though it may be you do not know it. You are honored in the
   consciences of those very men who thus speak evil of you. Whatever they
   may say, in their hearts they reverence you. They may call you evil
   names, but they know they do not belong to you. They may call you a
   dog, but they believe you an angel. They may call you black, but they
   believe you white. Here is a proof of it--if they were to see you fall
   into sin, they would say directly, "He is one of your members!" Why
   would they say that? Because they really expect you to be holy and
   consistent! And it is not till they have proof of the fact that you are
   not so, that they can deny the respect and honor of their own
   consciences. An ungodly man is not to be found whose conscience would
   not force him, inwardly, to do you honor. Even Satan himself was
   obliged to admit the majesty of holiness, if, as Milton tells us--

   "Abashed the devil stood, And felt how amazing goodness is." Goodness
   is an amazing thing to a wicked man! He sees you bear with patience
   what he says against you--it surprises him that you forgive injuries
   and it vexes his heart--he cannot understand it. There is a power about
   Christianity which makes the enemy fall back, and a majesty in
   righteousness before which he must tremble. You need not concern
   yourselves about taking care of your own character before the eyes of
   men, but you must see that it is right before the eyes of God--if you
   serve Him, He will honor you!

   Again, the most wicked men will honor the Christian when they come to
   die. I have known some few hardened wretches who passed out of the
   world as they had lived--in open rebellion against God and who, to the
   last, therefore, despised religion. But, generally, I have found that
   the scoffer changes his tone when death approaches. "Send for someone
   to visit me," is his cry then! "For whom shall we send? Shall it be
   John, the swearer?" "Oh, no, send for John, the praying man. I should
   like him to pray over me. Or send for the minister." "But why don't you
   ask for your old companions? You used to say that they were the
   jolliest fellows, they were the merriest men you ever met? You know
   there is no such place as Heaven or Hell, for you often said so when in
   their company. Many a glass have you drunk with them--why not have
   another before you die?" Ah, such companions as these will not do for
   him now! And that fact proves the honor which such a man, at last, puts
   upon the Christian. His language then is, "Let me die the death of the
   righteous, and let my last end be like his." The ungodly scorn their
   own comrades' society and run to our camp then! They think there is
   something in religion when they come to die! The voice of the last
   enemy speaks with a tongue of iron and a sound of thunder--and makes
   even the most hardened conscience honor the Christian.

   Once more, the Christian man is honored after he is dead. If you want
   to be thought well of and spoken of with high honor, you must die. All
   of us who are alive must be slandered and criticized. But when we have
   been a while in our graves, it may be that we shall, in our turn, be
   the masters! Many men are stars to the world now who were but glowworms
   when they were alive! While playing their part among men, they were run
   down, scoffed at and spoken of as everything that was bad. But they
   descended to the grave, a few years passed away and now, looked at from
   a distance, they bear a very different aspect to the general eye!
   Looking upon them now is like gazing at the sun--you see their
   brightness far more than their spots! The world misses the Christian
   when he is gone. Perhaps one member of a family is godly and the rest
   are not, and they say, "Oh, we don't care for him, he is too religious
   for us!" But they will feel a sad gap when he is gone--and one which
   they will not be able to fill. The neighborhood, too, in which he
   lived, will miss him because his words of kindness and deeds of mercy
   will be seen no more. They will say, "Well, after all, he was a good
   fellow." How often have I heard that, "Ah, well, he was not so bad,
   after all. There are not many left so good as he was." You don't know
   why this change has been worked in people's minds, but so it often is.
   Death embalms the poorest Believer and lays him in the sepulcher of the
   kings! He who was but a common Christian becomes a brilliant light when
   God hangs him up, like a lamp with a silver chain, to glitter from the
   skies!

   II. GOD WILL HONOR HIM IN THE INTERMEDIATE STATE.

   When a Christian dies, his soul at once ascends to Heaven. Not so his
   body--that continues in the grave until the Resurrection morning and,
   sometimes, we are anxious to know what will be our lot while our souls
   are separated from our bodies. Let me say then, for a certainty,
   according to God's Word, that before our bodies rise, we shall be in
   Paradise, for Jesus said to the penitent thief, "Today shall you be
   with Me in Paradise." There is no "purgatory" into which souls are
   dragged in order to be prepared and made fit for Heaven! But although
   they go at once to the Heaven of God, and rest in His Presence, it is
   not the full consummation of their bliss. They will not be satisfied
   till they wake up in the likeness of Christ--when body and soul will be
   reunited.

   What are the honors which the pure spirit will receive when, freed from
   this tabernacle of clay, it comes before its God? The Almighty will
   then say, "I see My son," or, "I behold My daughter. Your spirit I
   loved with an everlasting love. Your name I wrote in the Covenant of
   Election. I sent My Son to die for you. I called you by My Grace. I led
   you through all the desert. I fed you by My hand. I guided you through
   dangers and snares into the right way and I will keep you forever.
   Thrice-honored servant, you have done well--enter and take your place
   among the spirits of the redeemed." Angels, too, are ready to attend
   upon the saints. A saint in Heaven will receive all the service which
   an angel can perform. If the archangel Michael, himself, could do the
   meanest service for a child of God, he would consider himself thrice
   honored! "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
   for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" We cannot tell what glory
   the saints have, even now, while their bodies are yet in the house of
   death and under the cold slab. Yet we know that their souls are more
   glorious than the angels--and more honored than the cherubim that sing
   incessantly before the Throne of Jehovah!

   III. If any man serves the Lord Jesus Christ, HE SHALL BE HONORED IN
   THE GREAT DAY OF JUDGMENT. That day is approaching. I will not attempt
   to describe the scene which shall be witnessed when the heavens and the
   earth shall flee away--and when the quick and the dead, the righteous
   and the ungodly shall stand before God. In the Day of Judgment, God
   will honor His servants from the mouths of the wicked, from the mouths
   of devils, from the lips of angels and from His own lips!

   At the Day of Judgment, God will honor the righteous before even the
   wicked themselves. You proud monarchs, who put to death the servant of
   God, sending him in a fiery chariot to Heaven, how confounded will you
   be when the lowly martyr, on whom you wreaked your vengeance, shall
   stand before you and say, "Tyrant, I suffered for the Truth's sake at
   your hands." And what shall the lordly cardinal say, then, and the
   wicked priest who put to death, when they had the power, the men who
   would not forsake the Truth of God and do violence to their
   consciences, even though fire and torture had to be endured in
   consequence of their loyalty to their Savior? And how will the ungodly
   look the righteous in the face? How will the hardened sinner feel when
   he has to confront that man of God whom he stretched upon the rack? How
   will he tremble who was the unjust judge who signed his death warrant?
   The Christian will then be able to point out his persecutors and the
   entire universe will regard them with disdain. "That is the man," he
   will say, "who stretched me on the rack! That is the man who cast me
   into prison! Yon wretched men chained me to the stake and that man
   brought forth the fire and firewood which consumed me."

   But how honored is the martyr now! He is arrayed in robes more
   glorious, though not more white, than others can wear--garments more
   studded with jewels, though not more the workmanship of the Savior--and
   on his head is a crown heavy with brilliance! While the monarch who
   persecuted him and all who aided him shall be cowed into silence and
   shrink away in despair, calling upon the mountains and the hills to
   cover them, how will the Prophets be honored? I think I see Jeremiah
   standing before those kings who laughed at his predictions and with his
   fellow heroes exclaiming, in triumph, "O king, was not my prophecy
   fulfilled? Is not Babylon cast down? Is not Nineveh become as a heap?
   Where is Petra, the city of Edom? Where are the houses of Baal and the
   temples of the gods? Are they not fallen, fallen, fallen, even as I
   prophesied?" How great will be the triumphs of those grand old Prophets
   when they stand before those who scoffed at and ridiculed them--who
   then shall be obliged to confess that not one of their words has
   failed, but that every threat that came from the mouth of God has been
   fulfilled!

   And I think there will also be great honor put upon the ministers of
   the Gospel, the men whom God has, Himself, chosen. The men who, by a
   sacred impulse within their souls, were forced to speak--not the
   man-made minister, made so by the imposition of the hands of the
   bishop, or of the presbyters--who shall then be confronted with those
   who despised their message. Unto such will Jehovah say, in the presence
   of the men whom He chose to proclaim His Gospel, "Inasmuch as you
   scoffed at the words of these, My servants, you did it unto Me. It
   would have been better for you that a millstone had been hanged about
   your neck and that you had been cast into the midst of the sea! Depart,
   you cursed, into everlasting fire."

   And every member of Christ's Church shall receive honor in that day. I
   am sometimes doubtful whether the sins of the elect will be read out
   before the world, but, if so, I am certain it will not be for the
   purpose of casting upon them any reproach, but only to make the
   judgment an impartial one. But of this I am sure, that their righteous
   acts will beproclaimed. This man was called a liar and he shall be
   proved to be truthful. Another was styled a hypocrite, but it shall be
   found that he was perfectly sincere and his false accusers shall be
   confounded. The biographies of the saints, written with the pen of God,
   shall be read out from the lips of the Eternal, that the universe may
   confer honor upon them! And, wicked men, whatever you have done in
   darkness, shall be declared in the light! Your midnight sins shall be
   exposed before the sun. Your most private acts shall be exhibited to
   the gaze of the entire universe and all your petty acts of cheating and
   fraud shall be read out to the world so that men and angels shall hear!
   And while you are dishonored, the righteous shall be honored, even from
   your lips. They shall be honored by words that shall be forced from you
   in that day, when God shall make His people stand forth clear as the
   sun, fair as the moon and terrible as an army with banners!

   Again, the saints shall be honored even from the devil himself. Do you
   not know that the saints are to judge the world? Nor are they to judge
   only men, for the great foe of God and man, Satan, himself, shall lift
   his brazen front, scarred with thunder, and receive his final sentence
   and begin his Hell anew! I think I hear God asking His saints, "Will
   you ratify the sentence that I have pronounced upon Satan?" I hear one
   loud, "Amen!" proceed from the entire host of the redeemed and I, for
   one, will say, "Amen," with all the voice I have, in favor of his
   condemnation! Full often have I fought with him and sometimes he has
   seemed as if about to triumph over me. And hurling his fiery darts, he
   has cried, "Now I will make a full end of you." But again and again
   have I been able to return to the attack and to exclaim, "Rejoice not
   against me, O my enemy! When I fall, I shall rise!" And soon he has
   been once more put to flight.

   And I believe, in that Last Great Day, the Lord will allow His saints
   to put their feet upon the neck of this Agag and I think I see the
   feeblest saint--Little-Faith himself--putting his foot upon the neck of
   the devil. And I know that if I may but once get my foot upon him, he
   shall not receive a heartier crush from anyone than he shall receive
   from me! I owe him no thanks, I can assure you. Full often has he cast
   me down, but, then, I will tread upon him--that will be a day of
   triumph, indeed, when the old dragon shall be laid prostrate, to be
   assaulted by every child of God, and to be the scoff and jeer of the
   universe! And thus--

   "The weakest saint shall win the day, Though death and Hell obstruct
   the way!"

   So the saints shall be honored by the wicked and even by the old
   serpent himself. But angels, also, will mention your names in their
   songs. Angels are the poets of Heaven and do you think that the heroes
   of earth shall have their praise sung in this world and that your deeds
   will not be sung in Glory? In the battle odes of the angels, there are
   names more celebrated than Alexander, or Hannibal, or Napoleon, and
   songs more melodious and seraphic than were uttered in honor of the
   battlefields of Blenheim and Waterloo! No praise shall be so great as
   that which angels shall give to the saints, except that which they
   ascribe to the Savior!

   The Church of Christ shall be honored then. Many a time has she had to
   sit as an outcast amid the ruins of the Temple, with locks broken and
   tears trickling down her cheeks, enduring the disdain of the world.
   With the voice of lamentation, we have heard her cry, "My Lord is
   gone," and we have seen her tear her garments in grief and woe. But the
   heart of the Church is still true to her Lord, whom, seeing not, she
   loves and, at times, notwithstanding her desolation, she is the
   possessor of unspeakable joy and full of glory! As the proud ones of
   the earth pass her by, they call her hypocrite and laugh at her
   pretensions to be the Bride of King Jesus, saying, "Her Husband has
   cast her off and will not acknowledge her! Is she not a despised
   woman?" Thus the poor Church sits and exclaims, "Behold, and see if
   there are any sorrow like unto my sorrow." But, in due time comes the
   Day of Judgment! Jesus steps from His Throne and, like Ahasuerus of
   old, stretches out the scepter and says, "My queen, my spouse, touch
   this emblem of mercy and live." Leading her up the steps of His high
   Throne, He places her beside Him and shows her to the assembled
   universe as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. Then he will take the crown of
   universal sovereignty and will place it upon His own head, none other
   being worthy of the honor, while another regal diadem shall be placed
   by Him on the head of His elect Queen. Then, turning to the Church, He
   will say, "I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with
   loving kindness have I drawn you." Her mourning shall then be turned
   into singing and she shall be clothed with the garments of
   praise--instead of the spirit of heaviness--while all her enemies shall
   be covered with confusion of face and be ashamed.

   IV. Lastly, GOD WILL HONOR THE RIGHTEOUS THROUGHOUT ETERNITY.

   The honors of the godly are not fleeting things--not the gewgaws of an
   hour that shall pass away. Last Thursday, when I was at Windsor Castle,
   I saw a man who was painting up the escutcheon of the last new-made
   knight, to be added to a long series of similar emblems which had their
   places in the hall. I said to him, "Are the escutcheons of all the
   knights here?" And I think he replied that they could be traced back to
   the very origin of the order. I thought to myself, "A fine honor this,
   to have conferred upon one a few stripes and stars, representations of
   rampant lions, beasts, tigers with two heads and such like! Wonderfully
   glorious these things make a man, to be sure!" A little paint can make
   it all, and the painter's brush can erase it! Yet there are men who
   will face death upon the battlefield to be thus honored, or to have
   their image cut in stone and placed upon a pedestal for men to gaze at!
   Wonderful glory is it not for a man to die for? It is such an honor, I
   imagine, as very few of us would care for, for this sort of glory will
   pass away.

   But the honor which the Christian shall receive will never fade! When a
   million years shall have elapsed, it shall be as fresh as ever, for
   Christ's promise shall always stand, "If anyone serve Me, him My Father
   will honor." Christian, the hour of your honor is coming, when your
   name shall be pronounced by the great Judge and Arbiter of all, and you
   shall be acknowledged by Him as one among the followers of the Lamb!
   You shall receive more enduring honors than the men of this world can
   bestow! You may not receive the reward of an earthly coronet, but you
   shall be a priest and a king unto God, and shall reign with Christ
   forever and ever! Blush not, Christian, to look the whole world in the
   face, for in God's sight you are a king! Walk, therefore, with humility
   before God, and wait patiently till the Master shall remove you to your
   kingdom--there you shall be clothed with glory and become the possessor
   of everything which the heart can wish--honor, wealth, happiness,
   dignity and unspeakable joy shall be yours, and that forever. "If
   anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."

   Now, what shall I say, in conclusion, to those who do not serve God?
   Well, I have but little to say to you tonight. I have often found that
   when preaching on these subjects, I have said little to sinners. God
   has said a great deal more to them than I have, for all that has been
   spoken respecting the bliss of the righteous has set them wishing it
   were their lot! It is not infrequently the case that sermons which seem
   to be more especially adapted to comfort saints, prove especially
   powerful to the conversion of sinners because they have been led to say
   to themselves, "All these promises are not intended for us." Let me ask
   you, then, my Brother and my Sister, if this is the case at present
   with you--when will you appropriate these things to yourself ? I have
   told you that the righteous shall be honored. Now, what were the
   righteous more than you are? You are ungodly, but the righteous would
   have continued the same had not Divine Grace interposed and made them
   new creatures in Christ Jesus. You are a great sinner, but such were
   some of us. Whatever may have been the form of your iniquity, there are
   those now among the family of God who were as bad as yourselves.

   I will ask you a question. Can you find, anywhere in the Bible, the
   declaration that you cannot be saved? Is it anywhere stated that it is
   possible for the man who comes to Jesus Christ to be lost? If you find
   that, then you may despair, but till then, you need never do so. But
   perhaps you say, "I know not how to come to Christ aright." I will tell
   you-- coming to Christ at all is coming aright, for He has said, "Him
   that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." It matters not whether a
   man comes running, limping, or creeping--so long as he gets to Christ,
   he has come the right way! You must not say, "I am too bad to be
   saved." That, in the hymn we sang just now, we are taught that nothing
   so much grieves the heart of Jesus--

   "As that unkind, injurious thought That He's unwilling to forgive."

   I do think, poor Sinner, He would forgive you anything sooner than this
   wicked unbelief! If Christ were once more upon this earth and could
   suffer again in the flesh as He did 1,800 years ago, I believe that you
   might spit upon Him, buffet Him, and crucify Him again, and yet not see
   a single frown upon His face. But when you stand up and say, "I do not
   believe that Christ has love enough to forgive me. I do not think He is
   willing to pardon mysins." I see the heart of the blessed Lord almost
   broken by such cruel words! "What? Poor Sinner," Christ might well
   exclaim, "have I not love enough to remove your guilt when I purchased
   you with My blood? Look at My hands and My feet and see the wounds
   which were inflicted for you." I think I see Him looking you in the
   face and saying, in words of the utmost tenderness and compassion,
   "Poor Soul, speak not so, nothing grieves My heart like that--not to be
   trusted by one I love is the most harrowing thing I can experience. I
   could almost as soon drink some drops of the cup of bitterness which I
   tasted in the Garden, as to hear you say that I cannot forgive you. I
   can, I WILL, I DO! This very hour I say unto you, 'I, even I, am He
   that blots out your transgressions for My own sake!'" Remember that,
   Sinner--not for your sake, not to glorify you, but to honor Jesus
   Christ--"'and will not remember your sins.'" Take heart, therefore,
   poor Soul! If you will go to Him, there is Grace for you, and you shall
   be saved.

   But know, you Pharisees, that He came not to call the righteous!
   Sinners, only, Jesus came to save! And now, saints of God, let me urge
   you to despise the scorn and the contempt of men. Think of the glories
   you shall soon inherit and the honors that your soul and body shall
   receive at the Judgment Day. By filling our minds with thoughts of the
   glories of Heaven, the Word of God, the blessings that are eternal and
   full of glory, the love of Jesus and the mercies of Jehovah, we shall
   be graciously strengthened and enabled to conquer in the fight and keep
   the road to Heaven. In the strength of the Lord we cry, "Nil
   desperandum!" We still believe that Christ is our Shield, and Christ
   our Sun, and doubt not that we shall hear it said at the last, "Well
   done, good and faithful servant, enter you into the joy of your Lord."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN15:9-27.

   This chapter contains some of the choicest of the utterances of the
   Lord Jesus to His disciples. On His way from the upper room in
   Jerusalem, where He had instituted the Supper, to the Garden of
   Gethsemane, where He was about to be betrayed, He spoke these wondrous
   words of cheer and counsel. He had been speaking to His followers
   concerning fruit-bearing. Now He turns to another subject.

   Verse 9. As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you: continue in
   My love. Oh, what love for Christ's disciples to continue in--a love
   which finds no parallel except the love of the Father to His
   well-beloved Son! A love, therefore, without beginning, without end,
   without measure, without limit, without change! Oh, to be fully
   possessed by this love! I will read this verse again. It is such s
   sweet silver bell that we cannot hear it ring too often. "As the Father
   has loved Me, so have I loved you: continue you in My love." That is,
   live in it, abide in it, make it your home and your continual dwelling
   place.

   10. If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love. Obedience
   will enable you to live in this love as the fish live in the sea. You
   shall always enjoy it if, by Grace, you are enabled always to be
   obedient to your Lord's commands.

   10-12. Even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His
   love. These things have I spoken onto you, that My joy might remain in
   you, and that your joy might be full. This is My commandment, That you
   love one another, as I have loved you. Oh, you who profess to be the
   disciples of Christ, take heed to this new commandment which He has
   given and do not violate it! Let your very nature be love. Let your
   very spirit be love and then let your whole life be transmuted into the
   pure gold of love!

   13, 14. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life
   for his friends. You are My friend if you do whatever I command you.
   Obedience to Christ's commands leads us into the banqueting house of
   friendship. We never understand how friendly Christ is to us, nor do we
   become His familiar companions until we are obedient to Him.

   15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what
   his lord does. Things that he is told to do are not explained to him.
   It is enough for him to obey the orders that are given to him by his
   master.

   15. But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of
   My Father I have made known unto you. Christ has told all to His own
   chosen ones. There are no secrets which we would keep from Him, or
   which He keeps from us. Oh, what hallowed communion! This blessed
   result comes of obedience to our Lord. May God enable us to enjoy it
   richly!

   16. You have not chosen Me, but Ihave chosen you, and ordainedyou,
   thatyou shouldgo and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
   remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name He may
   give it to you. God's servants are all ordained. I sometimes hear
   remarks which remind me that there still lingers among as the
   superstition about ordained ministers. There is no ordination of a
   minister except the descent of the Spirit of God upon him, and the
   choice of the Church which calls him to his special sphere of work. All
   the saints are partakers of the Divine Ordination--they are all
   ordained to minister before the Lord. "I have chosen you and ordained
   you." For what purpose? "That you should go and bring forth fruit." Oh,
   that we may prove the reality of our ordination to this blessed work by
   bringing forth fruit--fruit that shall remain!

   17-27. These things I command you, that you love one another If the
   world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hatedyou. Ifyou
   were of the world, the world wouldlove its own: but because you are not
   of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
   world hates you. Remember the words that I said to you, The servant is
   not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also
   persecute you; if they have kept My sayings, they will keep yours also.
   But all these things will they do unto you for My name's sake, because
   they know not Him that sent Me. If Ihad'not come and spoken onto them,
   they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that
   hates Me hates My Father also. If Ihad'not done among them the works
   which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now they have both
   seen and hated both Me and My Father But this came to pass that the
   Word might be fulfilled that is written in their Law, They hated Me
   without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto
   you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the
   Father, He shall testify of Me, and you also shall bear witness,
   because you have been with Me from the beginning.

Seeing Christ's Day

   (No. 2652)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 10, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   23, 1882.

   "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and he saw it, and was
   glad." John 8:56.

   THESE Jews had claimed to be of the seed of Abraham and the Lord Jesus
   Christ admitted their claim as far as it was a valid one. It is always
   best, in argument, to concede as much as you can fairly grant to your
   opponent. Sometimes we take a few steps backward in order to get a
   firmer footing, that we may leap forward with greater sureness. In the
   case of these Jews, since they said Abraham was their father, the Lord
   Jesus admitted that they were his seed according to the flesh and
   therefore He said, "Your father Abraham."

   Very much might be spoken in honor and commendation of Abraham. He was
   a princely man, well worthy to be called "the father of the faithful,"
   for, though all Believers have a certain beauty about them because of
   their faith, yet Abraham stands head and shoulders above the rest of
   them--at least, above those who lived before the Incarnation of Christ.
   Much, therefore, might be said in his favor, but there is no word of
   commendation which could possibly exceed this utterance of Jesus, our
   Lord, to the quibbling Jews in Jerusalem, "Your father Abraham rejoiced
   to see My day: and he saw it, and was glad." Let this stand as the very
   crown jewel among all the gems that make up Abraham's crown, that he
   saw the day of Christ through the mist of2,000 years or thereabouts,
   and so saw it that his heart was gladdened at the sight! There may be
   many good things that might be truly said of you, dear Friends, but the
   best thing that ever can be said of you is, "They saw Christ's day, and
   were glad." Whatever else you do not see, if you see this, all is well
   with you! Blessed, indeed, are your eyes if you can, by faith, behold
   the Lamb slain for sinners and so behold Him as to be saved by His
   death. I do not think that anything better than this could be said of
   Abraham and nothing better will be said of any of you than this
   testimony from the lips of Christ, Himself, "He saw My day, and was
   glad."

   Yet we must learn, from our text, a sad lesson before we go fully into
   its teaching concerning Abraham. It reminds us that however good a man
   may be, personally, he cannot possibly ensure that his descendants will
   be like he was. It was to the carping, unbelieving Jews that our Lord
   said, "Your father Abraham." What a contrast there was between the
   princely father and those who boasted that they were his children!
   There they stood, howling like so many wolves around the Lamb of God,
   all eager to devour Him! Their fingers were itching to pick up stones
   with which they might put to death the Lord of Life and Glory, yet they
   were the descendants of Abraham! The children of "the friend of God"
   were seeking to slay God's only-begotten and well-beloved Son! And, a
   little later, those who were descended lineally from the loins of the
   great Patriarch gathered in the street about Pilate's palace and cried,
   "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"--that, "Him," being the Son of the Highest
   who was One with the ever-blessed Father and Spirit, and who had come
   to earth upon an errand of mercy and love. Yet the men who were the
   first and loudest to clamor for His death were those who said, "Abraham
   is our father."

   It is almost enough to make some good men come out of their graves to
   see what their children or their grandchildren are doing. It is a sad
   thing that Divine Grace seems to quit some families. It never does run
   in the blood--that cannot be, for all God's children are born, "not of
   blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
   God." And of God alone. Yet is it a very blessed fact that, often, if
   Grace does not run in the blood, it runs side by side with it, and
   godly fathers joyfully live to see their children treading in their
   footsteps. In some families, they have this highest of all honors--that
   they are a household of saints. Generation after generation, this is
   the testimony concerning them, that they are a company of people whom
   God has blessed. But, alas, it is not always so and as it was not so
   with Abraham's seed in Christ's day, as the Jews had, to a very large
   extent, apostatized so far that they even sought to slay the Christ of

   God!

   You and I must not be staggered when we see the same thing occurring in
   other families, the heads of which were renowned for Grace. With holy
   diligence we should seek to bring up our children in the fear of the
   Lord so that if they do wander, it may not be through our fault, for if
   we have to blame our guilty neglect, or our evil example for their
   going astray, it will, indeed, be sad for us. But if we are satisfied,
   in the sight of God, that we have done all that we could to bring them
   to Jesus, then, if they should dishonor our name, yet at least there
   will not be this wormwood mingled with the gall that we helped them to
   tread the downward road. O Brothers and Sisters, with all your hearts
   cry mightily unto God that your household, to as many generations as
   yet shall come, shall never lack a man to stand before the Lord God of
   Israel, and to be a faithful witness for Him and for His Truth in the
   midst of the wicked and perverse people by whom they may be surrounded!

   This Truth of God is manifest on the very surface of our text--Abraham
   was a great saint, a mighty saint, a clear-eyed saint whose gaze
   pierced through those 20 centuries and beheld his Lord! Yet, after the
   flesh, he was the father of a bleary-eyed generation that could not see
   the Eternal Light, even when it flashed directly upon their eyes! I
   think there is nothing that is more full of warning than this to those
   of you who are descended from godly parents. I charge you, before the
   living God, put no confidence in your descent. "You must be born
   again." Even if you are the best of all who have ever been born of
   woman, "you must be born again." Wisely did Job speak when he said,
   "who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one." No mother can
   bring into this world a perfect being, for the whole human race is
   fallen-- we are the degenerate children of a father who, himself, was
   unfaithful to the allegiance which he owed to his God. The stain from
   that first sin of Adam is upon us all, so let us not say, "We are
   Abraham's seed." Let us not talk about being descended from a line of
   saints, but rather, let us take to ourselves what Christ said to the
   Jews on another occasion, "Except you repent, you shall all likewise
   perish." However gracious our genealogy may be, unless our family tree
   begins in Christ and we, ourselves, are personally grafted into Him, we
   shall die in our sins and perish forever. God help us, who have been so
   highly privileged as to be born of godly parents, to lay that Truth of
   God to heart and to seek the Lord now, that we, also, may be numbered
   among those who are saved!

   With these observations by way of preface, let us now come directly to
   the text. And we shall notice, first, in what respects Abraham saw
   Christ's day. Secondly, the effect it had upon him. That will lead us,
   in the third place, to think of the respects in which we, also, may see
   Christ's day, and to notice, in closing, the effect which such a sight
   will have upon us. If we see His day, we shall also rejoice and be
   glad.

   I. First, then, let us enquire, IN WHAT RESPECTS DID ABRAHAM SEE
   CHRIST'S DAY?

   I understand the term, "Christ's day," to mean, first, His day of
   humiliation here upon earth. Christ had a certain "day" when He lived
   here in this world. What if I were to call His whole natural life on
   earth one long Lord's-Day? Had the Jews known the things which would
   have made for their peace, our Lord's sojourn here would have been to
   that nation one long Sabbath! Had they understood the rest which Christ
   brings to believing, obedient souls, it would have been the true
   Jubilee to them! But there is another "day" yet to come, which, in the
   highest sense, our Lord will call, "My day." Know you not that He is to
   come a second time, without a sin-offering unto salvation? This was
   foretold by the angels who said to His disciples, after His Ascension,
   "This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come
   in like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven." Arrayed in the
   vesture of His Humanity--for He still wears it at the right hand of the
   Father--He will come again, but not as He came the first time--

   "The Lord shall come! A dreadful form With rainbow wreath and robes of
   storm! On cherub wings and wings of wind, Appointed Judge of all
   mankind!"

   He shall come to gloriously reign on earth among His ancients! He shall
   come to gather to Himself His own, those that have made a covenant with
   Him by sacrifice. He shall come to set the sheep on His right hand and
   the goats on the left--and to make a severance between them that fear
   the Lord and them that fear Him not. This will be His Second Day, the
   great day of His appearing, the day for which all other days were made,
   after which there shall be no day that can be ended with a night, but
   the Ancient of Days shall reign forever and ever, King of Kings, and
   Lord of Lords! This is also His day and, without drawing fine
   distinctions, I have no doubt that Abraham saw Christ's day in this
   double sense-- and that he knew Him both as the Lamb slain, and as the
   King who is to reign forever and ever!

   How did he see Christ's day? I answer, first, by a far-seeing,
   clear-sighted faith. I do not know what Revelation, which is not
   recorded, God may have made to Abraham--whether he had, in night
   visions, as Daniel did, beheld the King sitting upon His Throne. But,
   whatever he did know, he turned to practical use by believingit. He
   believed that the Lord would come in the fullness of time. He believed
   that there would be a Seed of the woman that would bruise the serpent's
   head according to the promise at the gates of Paradise. He believed,
   most assuredly, that a Man would come who would give rest unto His
   flock, that Man being his own Seed, in connection with whom God had
   expressly said that He would bless Abraham, and make him a blessing.
   "Your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in your seed shall
   all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed My
   voice." So Abraham's faith often realized what it saw. We have no
   record of the subject of his morning meditations when he rose early
   that he might spend some time alone with the Lord before the world
   became dim with smoke, or the business or ordinary occupation of the
   day had commenced. At such seasons I have no doubt that Abraham was in
   his chosen place of prayer, waiting and watching--looking into the
   far-distant future and seeing with gladdened heart that day of the Lord
   which now has come--and that other day of the Lord which is yet to
   arrive. He believed it and therefore he saw it!

   Brothers and Sisters, there is no seeing unless there is believing! I
   have heard that seeing is believing, but it is not--it is the very
   opposite! Seeing and believing do not run this way--to see first and
   then to believe. They run the other way--believe and then see! And that
   is just what Abraham did. He believed God and then he saw Christ's day
   afar off and was glad. See as much as you like after you have believed,
   but remember our Lord's words to Thomas, "Blessed are they that have
   not seen, and yet have believed"--that is, those who did not need to
   see first, but believed first, and then their eyes were so opened that
   they saw the salvation of God.

   When once you get faith, there are many windows through which that
   faith can look. And no doubt Abraham saw Christ's day through the
   windows of special promises. There were not so many made to him as we
   have now with our larger Revelation in the entire Bible, but, still,
   there were sufficient promises to be used by his faith and especially
   that one which I quoted to you just now, "In your seed shall all the
   nations of the earth be blessed." That promise, alone, was enough to
   make him know that God would, in due time, give him a Seed through whom
   all the nations of the earth would be blessed. If you want to see
   Christ, dear Friends, borrow the telescope of promise. Faith is very
   fond of that optic glass and it is amazing what she can see when she
   puts it to her eye. Ten thousand blessings, not seen by our natural
   vision, become visible to the eye of faith when we look at them through
   the medium of the promises of God.

   Next, Abraham saw Christ with the eye of faith in the types that came
   before him. There were at least two very remarkable ones, or I might
   call them three. The first was Melchizedek. I cannot help believing
   that when Abraham met Melchizedek, the Priest of the most high God,
   first King of Righteousness and then King of Peace--and when he gave
   Him tithes of all and received His blessing--he recognized in
   Melchizedek One who was greater than himself. Neither can I help
   believing that after he had partaken of the bread and wine which
   Melchizedek brought to him, and had gone back to his own quiet oratory
   once more, he must--or at least he may have had some clear intimation,
   to his own mind, that this was one of the grandest types of that Seed
   which was to bless all nations of the earth! And, Beloved, have not we
   seen Jesus as our Melchizedek? When we have been battling with the
   kings. When we have come back weary from the conflict, has not Jesus
   met us and refreshed us with His bread and wine? Has He not blessed us
   and have we not then adored Him and felt that we must say to Him,
   concerning all that we have, "Take not merely a tithe, but take it
   all"? Blessed are the men and women who, with eyes of Abraham, have
   spied out Christ beneath the robes of Melchizedek! And I cannot help
   thinking that if we, the children, can do so, he, the father of the
   faithful, must have also done it! Paul could clearly see Christ in
   Melchizedek--and surely Abraham, also, must have seen Christ in Him!

   But especially did Abraham see Christ's day in the type that was given
   him in Isaac--I cannot help thinking that when Isaac was born, not
   after the flesh, but according to the promise--for the seed according
   to the flesh was sent about his business, and his mother with him. And
   when Abraham made a great feast at the weaning of that child whose very
   name was laughter--and the promise of whose birth had made the
   venerable Patriarch, close upon his 100th year, fall down upon his face
   and laugh at the very thought. And whenever, afterwards, he looked upon
   that son of joy, given to him, not by the strength of nature, but by
   the visitation of God--I say he saw, there, a picture of Him who is not
   born to us after the energy of manhood, but by the power of the Holy
   Spirit, and who has come among us to bless and cheer us till our very
   heart laughs again as we think of Jesus, the Son of the promise. He is
   our true Isaac! Now is our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue is
   full of praises as we think of Him.

   But chiefly, Abraham saw Christ in type and figure on that memorable
   day when he took Isaac up to the top of Mount Moriah and, at the
   command of God, unsheathed his knife to slay his son! Abraham must then
   have seen the Everlasting Father about to act in the same fashion
   towards His only-begotten Son. He saw, in Isaac, the victim bound and
   laid upon the altar and then, in the ram caught in the thicket, he saw
   the very symbol of the Lamb of God, who, in the fullness of time, would
   be offered upon the altar of Calvary for our sakes, that He might die
   as our Substitute and Representative. There could never have been, I
   think, a more plain parallel than in this case--and in all these types
   Abraham saw Jesus Christ's day, and was glad.

   Once more, Abraham did actually see Christ's day, not by faith only,
   but in the disembodied state, after he was dead and buried. There he
   slept, with Sarah, in the cave of Machpelah, but his spirit was neither
   dead nor buried--it was in the place of souls separated from their
   bodies and it is remarkable that, in the account of the death of
   Lazarus, our Lord says that he was taken to Abraham's bosom, as if the
   Patriarch had given a name to that very world in which the gracious
   dwell when they quit this house of clay. From that place of bliss, he
   looked down upon all the wondrous Life that began at Bethlehem and
   closed at Calvary. He was seeing Christ's day even while Jesus was
   speaking to these Jews, and from the celestial seats he must have gazed
   with wonder that God should thus assume the nature of man!

   II. That is enough concerning Abraham, except that we have to dwell, in
   the second place, for just a minute or two, upon THE EFFECT OF THIS
   VISION UPON ABRAHAM.

   It made him glad. He rejoiced at the very thought of seeing Christ's
   day. It is a very strong word which is used here for rejoicing--"he
   leaped forward"--that would be the correct expression. At the thought
   of seeing Christ's day and when he did see it, he was glad. It is a
   curious thing that the second word should be a softer one than the
   other. There is no idea of leaping or jumping about the second, but in
   the first, there is. Master Trapp renders it, "His good old heart
   danced levaltoswithin him, as children use to dance about a
   bonfire--with an exuberance of joy"--at the very thought that Jesus
   Christ would come in the flesh and that he would see Him. But when he
   did see Him, that kind of rejoicing seemed to subside and he appeared
   to rise into a calm state of intense gladness.

   You know that when Christ first makes us glad in Him, we do not know
   how to contain ourselves. But afterwards our capacity increases and we
   are able to hold more. There may be far less excitement, but there is
   more real joy after all. You remember how it is put in Isaiah
   40:31--"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
   shall mount up with wings as eagles." That is, when they are young and
   light. "They shall run, and not be weary"--that is, when they are
   getting a little stronger they do not take to flying. They know better,
   so they are content to run. But what comes next? "They shall walk, and
   not faint." The pace gradually gets less--from flying to running and
   from running to walking. Is that a growth? Certainly! It is always
   better to walk than to run.

   Some young folk, when they are first converted, are very eager to fly.
   Fly away, Brothers, while you can, and you who can run, run as fast as
   you are able! But, mark you, it is the steady pace that does not kill,
   which enables us to live down death itself! I do not read that Enoch
   flew with God, or ran with God, but he, "walked with God." And he kept
   that pace up for 300 years! And he could have kept it up even longer.
   Let a man fly while he may. Let him run when he can, but walking is the
   best pace, after all. So, from our text we learn that Abraham rejoiced
   and leaped forward to see Christ's day. And when he saw it, he sobered
   down, and was glad. And that is the best condition in which the spirit
   can remain. I cannot help thinking that it was this inward joy--this
   intense but calm gladness--that made Abraham such a noble man
   throughout all his life.

   Isaac is a very little man compared with his father Abraham. Where
   there is a high mountain, there generally is a low valley, so it was
   with Abraham and Isaac, and, as to Jacob, though he was a great man in
   some respects and especially great at driving bargains, yet, someway,
   he had nothing of the nobility of Abraham who walked along in the
   dignity of a true prince among men. What a grand reply Abraham gave to
   the king of Sodom who had said to him, "Give me the persons, and take
   the goods to yourself." Though all the spoil was his by the laws of
   war, yet he answered, "I have lifted up my hands unto the Lord, the
   most high God, the possessor of Heaven and earth, that I will not take
   from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take anything
   that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich."

   No, no, Abraham was too great a man to stoop at the foot of the king of
   Sodom, even to take what was his by right. He had fought for him and
   brought him back the spoil--and he handed it over to him without any
   exception but that which had been eaten by the young men, or taken by
   the others who had gone with him--his neighbors and friends who had a
   right to their share, although Abraham refused to take his portion of
   the plunder.

   The Patriarch had many troubles but before his history is closed, it
   was recorded that "the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things." He had
   believed God in all things and God had blessed him in all things! His
   was a happy, calm, noble, dignified life almost throughout the whole of
   it. Oh, that you and I might drink in deep draughts of Abraham's faith
   and that our eyes might see Christ's day even more clearly than Abraham
   saw it--that we might have rejoicing and gladness like his! Nothing can
   so surely bring this joy to our souls as faith like that which he
   possessed.

   III. So much for Abraham. Now we come to ourselves and enquire, IN WHAT
   RESPECTS DO WE SEE CHRIST'S

   DAY?

   We stand, as it were, on a narrow neck of land between two seas of
   glory. Look back--there is Christ's day of mercy--salvation,
   reconciliation, death, conflict, victory. Now look forward and see, by
   faith, that sight which the Apostle describes, "For the Lord Himself
   shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
   archangel, and with the trump of God"--in splendor such as never was
   seen before and which shall make the sun, itself, to be ashamed because
   of the greater glory of Christ--the Sun of Righteousness!

   Now let us ask ourselves, have we really seen Christ in His first day?
   Search your hearts, dear Friends, and see. Have you looked to Christ as
   living and working out a robe of spotless righteousness? And then, as
   dying, that He might dye that robe crimson and make it fit for His
   chosen princes to wear? Have you seen Jesus on the Cross bearing your
   sins? This is a sight that is indeed worth living for! Heaven itself
   cannot match that sight and there is nothing that can excel it! When we
   are in sin's densest darkness, that sight brings more light than the
   rising sun. And when we are cast out, like the dry bones of the Valley
   of Vision, it is this sight that makes us live again and stand upon our
   feet, a part of the exceeding great army of God! Say, dear Friend, have
   you looked to Christ by faith? Are you looking to Him? Are you seeing
   His first day every day?

   And then, have you learned to look forward to His second coming? It is
   not a subject for curiosity, as some make it. It is not a subject for
   speculation, as others make it. But it isa subject for reverent
   expectation! I know not when He will come, but I know that He will
   come. He may come at any moment and the sooner the better for me, for
   let Him come when He may, He will be welcome. And if I am dead before
   He comes, I shall see His day all the same, "for I know that my
   Redeemer lives and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the
   earth: and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my
   flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall
   behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me." Fix
   your eyes upon the coming King, for it will make you strong! You are
   not fighting for a vanquished leader! He has won the victory and He
   will come back to wear the crown before long. There is no question
   about who is to win the great fight--Christ has already won it and He
   shall come back to divide the spoil with the strong. God has given it
   to Him and He shall have it!

   Listen to the trumpets that proclaim His appearing! Your faith may
   almost hear them sound, "Lo, He comes! Lo, He comes!" It is getting
   towards midnight in the history of the world. Both the wise and the
   foolish virgins are all too apt to go to sleep, but the cry may be
   heard even now by the ears of faith--and it will awaken us into supreme
   energy of action for our Lord, "Behold the Bridegroom comes; go you out
   to meet Him!" How little there is of that going out to meet Him! Let us
   have something of it tonight as we go out, in imagination and in faith,
   to meet Him who comes quickly. What countless trumpets shall then sound
   to wake the sleeping dead! Glory, glory, glory, to Him that once was
   despised and rejected of men! Welcome, welcome, Son of God! All Your
   saints delight in You! Came quickly, come quickly! Make no tarrying, O
   our God!

   IV. Now, lastly, we are to consider THE EFFECT OF THESE SIGHTS UPON US.
   If we really see them, they will do for us what they did for
   Abraham--they will make us glad--

   "Are you weary? Are you languid? Are you sorely distressed?"

   Come, then, get a sight of the weary and languid One who died for you
   upon the Cross! There is no gladness so easy to obtain as this. Is it
   not strange that when the mourner's heart is heavy, we never hear that
   he looks to the place where the star of Bethlehem burns, though there
   is joy there. But he looks where human woe culminated in the death of
   the Well-Beloved. To the Cross the mourner turns his eyes, for there is
   no light that can come into the darkened heart except from the pierced
   side and broken heart of Him whom we call Master and Lord. Do you want
   true joy? Then learn that joy was born where Christ died and that joy
   lives because Jesus lives--it flourishes because He is risen! Keep your
   eyes on Him and they shall know no tears save those which shall bless
   both eyes and hearts.

   Then, when you have found joy through looking on Christ's first coming,
   look forward to His second coming and get joy out of it, also. I cannot
   speak fully of that glorious event tonight, but, certainly, it is a
   well of joy. If you have seen Christ in His shame, it is a fountain of
   delight to expect to see Him in His honor and glory. You are nobody
   now-- the world knows you not, for it knew Him not--but when He shall
   appear, then will be the time of yourmanifestation also. "Then shall
   the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father."
   Now it is often heartache and headache, weariness and toilsome
   pilgrimage, but when He comes, it will be the marriage feast and all
   the merriment of which human hearts are capable! Oh, what a thrill of
   joy will go through this poor groaning world when He comes! Creation is
   in bondage and continually groans and, "we groan within ourselves,
   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." But when
   He comes, creation itself shall shake off its heavy weights and shall
   get rid of its night dreams. Swathed in mist today, our poor planet
   scarcely gives forth a ray of light, but then, with all mists removed,
   when Jesus comes, surely she shall shine more brightly than the morning
   star!

   And if every Believer is to be as the sun, what will this world be,
   filled with Believers, each one shining like the sun in its strength?
   Oh, clap your hands, Beloved, clap your hands, for He comes who is your
   Lord and Savior! "Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad!
   Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof. Let the fields be joyful and
   all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the forests rejoice
   before the Lord: for He comes, for He comes to judge the earth: He
   shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with His
   Truth."

   Children of the morning, the morning comes! What a day yours shall be,
   then, when your sun shall go down no more forever, for your Lord's
   coming shall be as a morning without clouds! Blessed and happy are they
   who, by faith, can see it! They can say good-bye to sin and good-bye to
   sorrow! They can say to all discouragements, to all baffling, to all
   defeats, "Farewell, for He comes, our Champion who will lead us forward
   to the everlasting victory, in whose name we set up our banners and in
   whose name, even now, our spirit rejoices with exceeding gladness that
   shall never end!"

   God give to each of you a portion in these glorious things, by a simple
   faith in Jesus, for His name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN8:31-59.

   Verse 31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on Him, If you
   continue in My word, you are My disciples indeed. For there were many,
   in Christ's day, coming to Him for a while and then going away from
   Him--professing to believe and then stumbling when Christ proclaimed
   some Doctrine of God which struck them as being strange and hard to
   receive. Our Lord Jesus tells them that constancy is necessary to true
   discipleship. It is of no use to start running in the race unless we
   continue in the course till the prize is won. We are not true pilgrims
   to Heaven merely because we cross the threshold of our door--we must
   keep on, and on, and on till we reach the golden streets of the New
   Jerusalem!

   32. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
   That is the result of being a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. With
   Christ, who is the Truth of God, to be our Teacher, and the Holy Spirit
   to bless His Words, we come to know the Truth--and the operation of the
   Truth upon the heart is to deliver us from the bondage of sin and of
   error.

   33. They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
   to any man: how can You say, You shall be made free? What a lie this
   was! They were at that very time in bondage to the Romans! They had
   been subdued and conquered and, a little while after, they, themselves,
   confessed that they had no king but Caesar. Men are not very selective
   about telling lies when they wish to resist Christ--they will do
   anything rather than believe on Him.

   34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whoever
   commits sin is the servant of sin. The man who habitually lives in sin
   is not a free man, for he is still a slave to sin. If he finds pleasure
   and delight in disobeying God, he has no right to talk about being a
   free man. His chains are rattling on his wrists--what can he know about
   freedom?

   35. And the servant abides not in the house forever; but the son abides
   always. A servant may be dismissed from the household, but a son may
   not. If we were only servants of God, we might fall from Grace and
   perish. But if we are the sons of God, we never shall. If we ever did,
   in truth, call God, "Father," we shall always be able to use that
   blessed title, for the relationship of fatherhood is not a temporary
   one and cannot come to an end.

   36. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, you shall be free,
   indeed. If you have the freedom of sonship, you are free, indeed. There
   are none so free in our Father's house as His children!

   37-39. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me
   because My word has no place in you. I speak that which I have seen
   with My Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father
   They answered and said unto Him, Abraham is our father Jesus said unto
   them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of
   Abraham. The real descendants of "the father of the faithful" are,
   themselves, faithful--that is, Believers. The father of Believers has
   Believers for his children. "If you were Abraham's children, you would
   do the works of Abraham." Our Lord had admitted that these Jews were
   Abraham's seed according to the flesh, but He proved that they were not
   Abraham's Seed in the high and spiritual sense, since they were not
   like he whom they claimed for a father.

   40, 41. But now you seek to kill Me, a Man that has told you the truth,
   which I have heard of God. Abraham did not do this. You do the deeds of
   your father. He had not told them who that father was, but as it is a
   standing rule that men do the deeds of their father, the genuineness of
   the descent which they claimed could be tested by their likeness to
   their father.

   41, 42. Then said they to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have
   one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father,
   you would love Me. Any man who is born of God must love Jesus Christ.
   The purity of His motives, the loveliness of His Character, the charms
   of His Person would all be sure to win the heart of a man who was truly
   born of God.

   42, 43. For I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I
   ofMyself but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Even
   because you cannot hear My word. "You are dull of comprehension. You
   are hardened in heart. You are proud in spirit. You are just the
   opposite of everything that is good and, therefore, you cannot hear My
   word," said Christ. "And this is proof positive that you do not love
   God and that you are not the children of God."

   44. You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you
   will do. Remember from whose lips these words fell, even from the lips
   of the gentle Jesus! Honest speech is the surest token of a loving
   heart, but, nowadays, if a man preaches the Truth of God plainly and
   faithfully, men say that he is hard and unkind. But if a man glosses
   over the Truth of God and alters it according to his own idea of what
   will please men, then they say, "He is a kindly-disposed and
   large-hearted man." I would be disposed to doubt whether he has any
   heart at all, if he will sooner see sinners damned than offend them by
   proclaiming the Truth! I thank God that some of us care little about
   offending those who offend God! If men will not yield themselves to the
   Lord, we want not their friendship, but we will strive to make them
   uneasy in their rebellion--and if they resolve to be lost, we will at
   least be clear of their blood.

   44. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth
   because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of
   his own, for he is a liar, and the father of it. Falsehood is his
   natural element. When Satan deceives, he only acts according to his
   nature which is blackened through and through with lies.

   45, 46. And because I tell you the truth, you believe Me not. Which of
   you convicts Me of sin? What a grand challenge! None of us can speak
   like that except in a very modified sense--but Christ, standing before
   His enemies, who gnashed their teeth at Him and would have given their
   eyes to be able to fix some fault upon Him--boldly says to them, "Which
   of you convicts Me of sin?"

   46-51. And if I say the truth, why do you not believe Me? He that is of
   God hears God's words: you, therefore, hear them not, because you are
   not of God. Then answered the Jews, and said unto Him, Say we not well
   that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil? Jesus answered, I have not
   a devil; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. And I seek not My
   own glory: there is One who seeks and judges. Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, If anyone keeps My sayings, he shall never see death. This
   statement quite staggered them! Yet it is true. To Believers--

   "It is not death to die,"

   they simply pass out of this world into a larger and yet more glorious
   life! They descend not to death, but they rise to immortality!

   52, 53. Then said the Jews to Him, Now we know that You have a devil.
   Abraham is dead and the Prophets; and You say, If anyone keeps My
   sayings, he shall never taste of death. Are You greater than our father
   Abraham, who is dead?And the Prophets are dead. Who do You make
   Yourself out to be?' 'Who do You make Yourself out to be? Someone
   greater than Abraham and the Prophets?"

   54-56. Jesus answered, If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing: it is My
   Father that honors Me; of whom you say, that He is our God: yet you
   have not known Him; but Iknow Him: and if I should say, I know Him not,
   I shall be a liar like you: but I know Him and keep His saying. Your
   father Abraham--"As you call him."

   56, 57. Rejoiced to see My day: and he saw it and was glad. Then said
   the Jews unto Him, you are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
   Abraham?They allowed a wide margin in speaking of our Savior's age, for
   He was only 33 years old. It may be true that the sorrows of His life
   had so marred His Countenance that He looked more like a man of 50 than
   one of thirty-three. I cannot tell, nor do I know whether that is what
   they meant. But it is amazing that they should have said to Him, "You
   are not yet 50 years old."

   58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
   Abraham was, I AM. They had asked Him, "Who do You make Yourself out to
   be?" And now they have His answer! "Before Abraham was, I AM," said
   Christ. It is the very name by which God revealed Himself to Moses at
   the burning bush, "I AM." Yet Jesus takes this title to Himself!
   "Before Abraham was"--not, "I was." Notice that. But, "I AM," as if His
   life was one continued present existence, as indeed it is, for with God
   there is no past or future, but all things are ever-present to His
   infinite mind! When Jesus said, "Before Abraham was, I AM," He claimed
   the Godhead--He declared that He was certainly God, self-existent from
   all eternity!

   59. Then took they up stones to cast at Him. They counted Him a
   blasphemer and so He was if He was not all He claimed to be. I have
   heard of some who reverence Christ, but do not believe Him to be
   God--but how can that be? He evidently made Himself out to be God and
   this was the great charge the Jews brought against Him. For this,
   indeed, they put Him to death, because He made Himself equal with God.
   If He were not equal with God--if He were not really God--He led men to
   thinkthat He was. And if this were false, it was a great sin not
   consistent with the holy Character of Christ. If He was not God, He was
   the grossest impostor who ever visited this world! But He isGod and
   nothing less! Yet because He claimed this, the Jews took up stones to
   cast at Him.

   59. But Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the Temple, going through
   the midst of them, andso passed by. Glory be to His holy name forever
   and ever!

The Head and the Body

   (No. 2653)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 17, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 6, 1882.

   "The head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together
   and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the
   effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the
   body unto the edifying of itself in love." Ephesians 4:15,16.

   IF I had to preach fully and accurately upon all that is taught in this
   text, I would certainly need to deliver a course of sermons, say five
   or six at least! There is such a wonderful depth of meaning in these
   Inspired Words that I might keep on expounding them and all the while
   be as one who takes water out of the sea--always wondering that there
   is so much more left than I can possibly draw from it. One writer says
   that the sense of this passage is as "compacted" as the joints of which
   it speaks, and that remark is a very true one, for here we have thought
   compressed as by hydraulic pressure! There is any quantity of it packed
   into the smallest possible space.

   Our translation of the words here used by the Apostle is not, in every
   point, absolutely accurate. I wonder whether one could be made that
   would be so? We would need a paraphrase rather than an exact rendering
   of the original, for such is the fullness of meaning that no one
   translation into our poor tongue could really convey all that the Holy
   Spirit intended to teach by the Greek words. They seem to totter and
   tremble beneath the burden of the massive thought they are meant to
   carry. I am, therefore, only going to preach a plain, simple sermon
   upon the passage as it appears in our Authorized Version, which, though
   it is not strictly and literally correct in this case, is, at any rate,
   quite according to the analogy of the faith--and can be abundantly
   supported by other passages of Scripture of similar import.

   Turning to the text, we find that the Apostle was very anxious that the
   saints at Ephesus should be knit together, like the different parts of
   one body. Unity is not an easy thing to attain. Have you found it so in
   your own family? In many large families and even in small ones, there
   are sometimes most unfortunate jars and disagreements--and it is a
   happy household, indeed, that is wholly joined together as one body.
   Look at the world in general, in its various corporations, societies
   and associations, and see what disunion and discord are manifested
   everywhere! Half the newspapers are occupied with reports of the
   squabbles in the different vestries, or in the big vestry that meets in
   the House of Commons--or the other one that assembles in the House of
   Lords. I suppose we would scarcely be men if we always agreed on all
   points. Certainly, there is plenty of division among us. We seem to
   remember the Tower of Babel and the dispersion, for our tongues are
   still confounded and we misunderstand one another! And what is more
   criminal, we often misrepresent one another and we are all too apt to
   forget our Lord's Words, "It must needs be that offenses come; but woe
   to that man by whom the offense comes!"

   Paul was most anxious to have the Ephesian Church thoroughly knit
   together. And the chapter from which our text is taken is all about
   unity and how to maintain it. With his manacled hands, the prisoner of
   the Lord writes to beseech them to be truly one--to walk worthy of the
   vocation by which they were all called by the one Spirit of God. He
   entreats them, with all lowliness, meekness and long-suffering, to bear
   and to forbear with one another in love. He most touch-ingly and
   tenderly pleads his own imprisonment as an argument with them to
   endeavor "to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." "By
   the remembrance of my bonds," he seems to say, "put yourselves into the
   blessed bonds of brotherly love." And then he adds, "There is one body
   and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling; one

   Lord, one faith, one baptism." Both in the inward creed and the outward
   confession of it they were all one--they were not divided on these
   points--so he begged them to be divided in nothing, especially as he
   was able to assure them that they had one God and Father, above all,
   through all and in all--and one Christ, the Savior of all!

   When he reminded them that He who ascended up on high is the same Jesus
   who descended first into the lower parts of the earth, I think he
   intended to remind them of the continuity of the work of Christ--that
   it was the same Christ who both descended and ascended. There was no
   change in the Worker, for the one work was worked by the one Person,
   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Why, then, should we split up,
   divide and hold a hundred opinions as if Christ were divided? Paul
   tells us that when He ascended on high, He gave all sorts of officers
   that were necessary for His Church-- Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists
   and so on--all for this purpose--"for the perfecting of the saints, for
   the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till
   we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
   of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
   fullness of Christ." It is this that the Apostle aimed at--that the
   saints should be one in Christ Jesus and then, remembering that one
   very frequent cause of division is the instability of many minds, he
   urged them to "be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried
   about with every wind of doctrine."

   But that they might know what they believed and not be driven away from
   it with every puff of wind. That they might not be misled and deceived
   by the sleight of men, by cleverness, by magicians who spirit the Truth
   of God away-- as so many religious tricksters are continually doing
   nowadays, establishing lies and overthrowing the Truth by their magical
   deception--Paul seems to allude to the casting of dice when he speaks
   of "the sleight of men." And I am afraid that there are many people
   whose religion comes to them according to what they call, "luck." They
   happened to be born on a certain street and their parents attended a
   particular place of worship, so they believed what was taught there.
   But if the dice had fallen in some other way, they might have been
   Muslims, or Mormons, or Roman Catholics, or God knows what, for they
   have not any solid reasons for believing what they are supposed to
   believe! They hold it, as it were, by a kind of chance and they are
   quite ready to let it go if "chance" should so arrange.

   The Apostle beseeches us to guard against this evil and to hold fast
   the faith, to be established in it and to know why we believe it, so
   that, "speaking the truth in love," we may grow up in all things into
   Christ, who is the one and only Head of the Church and to whom every
   living member is vitally joined. Every man who is indeed, saved, is a
   part of Christ's mystical body and he is to develop in harmony with the
   growth of the entire body until he and every other one joined with him
   in the living structure shall attain to the stature of a perfect
   man--the whole Church with its Head, Christ Jesus, becoming God's
   mystic, "perfect man" to be glorified forever and ever!

   You see, dear Friends, that even when I am only trying to introduce
   this great subject to you, I am overwhelmed with the vastness of it!
   There is a mint of meaning. There are masses of un-coined bullion in
   the heavenly treasury to which the Apostle brings us! It is impossible
   for me to set forth all the spiritual wealth which is revealed here,
   but I shall endeavor to point out four things which are brought to our
   notice in the text. First, our union to Christ the Head. Secondly, our
   individuality--"every joint"--"every part." Thirdly, our relationship
   to each other--"joined together"-- "that which every joint supplies."
   And, lastly, our compact unity in the one Church of Jesus Christ "makes
   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."

   I. First, then, Beloved, I have to speak to you concerning OUR UNION TO
   CHRIST. We cannot do better than begin with this great Truth of
   God--that Christ is the Head of His Church.

   Hence, we learn, first, that union with Christ is essential to the life
   of His Church. Men sometimes lose a foot, or a leg, or an arm, or an
   eye, or an ear. It is very remarkable how a man may continue to exist
   after he has lost several of his limbs, but he cannot live if his
   headis taken away. Cut that off and the decapitated body is dead in an
   instant! So, Brothers and Sisters, the Church of God lives because
   Christ lives and its life is entirely derived from Him. If there were
   no Christ, there would be no Church. And if there is, anywhere, a body
   of professors without vital union to Christ, they are nota church! They
   may have the name of a church, but they are assuredly dead! The Spirit
   of God flows through Christ into the whole of His true Church,
   permeating every part of His wonderful mystical body. But the Spirit of
   God is first on the Head and in the Head--and then from Him the
   gracious unction of the Holy One descends to the entire body. Ask
   yourselves, dear Friends, whether you are joined to Christ. Do you
   belong to that Church which is really one in Christ-- the true Catholic
   and Apostolic Church? By Catholic, of course, I mean universal--the one
   and only Church of the living

   God! All who are in Christ belong to His Church, but those who are out
   of Christ are outside the pale of His Church and if there is a church
   that is not in Him, it is not Christ's Church at all! So you see that
   union with Christ is essential to the life of His Church.

   Next, union with Christ is essential to the growth of His Church.
   Christ's Church must grow. We, as a Church, must seek continually to
   increase. A living Church is not like the building in which it
   meets--the material structure may never be enlarged--but if the Church
   is a living one, it keeps on growing. The true Church of Christ in the
   world is always advancing and multiplying. As the Apostle says, in our
   text, it "makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in
   love." But, Beloved, there is no edification except that which comes
   from Christ! He is the Church's true Teacher. He is the great Master
   Builder and it is by Him that the whole spiritual building is fitly
   joined together. We try to preach those Truths of God which are the
   nutriment of men's souls, but they do not nourish them because they
   come from us-- they only nourish them as they come from Christ! If you
   want to grow in Divine Grace, you must get from Christ all that is
   necessary for your growth. Do not think that Christ begins the great
   work and then leaves you to finish it. Oh, no! He makes us alive and He
   keeps us alive. He strengthens and develops the life that He has
   given--all its force and power must come from Him. Need I remind you of
   this? Yes, for I find it necessary to remind myselfand, therefore, I
   judge that I must also stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.
   Not a step heavenward, not in the least likeness to God, not to the
   smallest degree of holiness can you proceed apart from Jesus Christ
   your Head! Never forget this fact, simple though it is.

   Further, union to Christ our Head is also essential to our perfection.
   Will a time ever come when a saint will be perfect in himself, apart
   from Christ? Never, for we are only perfect in Christ Jesus, or, as the
   Apostle puts it, "You are complete in Him." Shall I ever get to be so
   holy that I can stand before God without my Mediator? Shall I ever have
   a spiritual beauty of my own which shall render the imputed
   righteousness of Christ unnecessary for me? Never! For even in our
   highest estate in Heaven, we shall still need to have our vital union
   with Christ perpetually maintained. He is the Head of the Church
   triumphant as well as of the Church militant! He will forever be the
   Head of the Church made perfect as surely as He is the Head of His
   poor, weak, feeble, but ever-growing Church on earth!

   Remember one more point, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, and that
   is that union to Christ the Head is essential to every member of His
   Church--not only is it essential to the body as a whole, but to every
   member of that body in detail. It is no use for my little finger to
   have unity with my hand and my arm if that arm is not united to my
   body, and my body is not united to my head. So each Believer must be
   personally joined to Christ. Whether he is only comparable to a little
   finger, or is like the strong bone of the leg, he must equally be
   joined to the Head--the smallest member of the mystical body of Christ
   cannot live apart from the Head, nor can the largest member. All alike,
   both great and small, comely and uncomely, manifest or concealed, must
   draw their life from Christ the Head! You must do so, my Brother or my
   Sister in Jesus, and so must I--let us always keep this great Truth of
   God in memory--a church that is only united in itself, but not united
   to Christ, is no living church at all.

   You may attain to the unity of the frost-bound earth in which men and
   women are frozen together with the cold proprieties of aristocracy, but
   it is not the unity of life! Or you may get the union of mere worldly
   enthusiasm in which men are fused together like molten metal, but the
   fire, if it is not of God, though it creates a certain sort of unity,
   creates not that living union which God designs and effects. The one
   all-important question for each of us is, Do I love the Lord Jesus
   Christ? If so, there is between my soul and my Savior a living, loving,
   lasting union. And if we all love Him, then Christ loves all of us, and
   we are living in Christ and Christ is living in us--and this is that
   marvelous miracle of union between the Divine and the human which, when
   men see it, are astonished! They cannot see the union itself, but they
   can behold its effects, as our Lord said, "By this shall all men know
   that you are My disciples, if you have love, one to another." This was
   Christ's prayer for us, for in that great intercessory supplication of
   His, He pleaded, first, for His immediate followers and then He added,
   "Neither pray I for these, alone, but for them, also, who shall believe
   on Me through their word; that they all may be one; as You, Father, are
   in Me, and I in You, that they, also, may be one in Us; that the world
   may believe that You have sent Me."

   That is the first point in the text, and a very essential one, our
   union to Christ the Head.

   II. From that I want to lead you, Beloved, as best I can, to the
   consideration of the second point, which is OUR INDIVIDUALITY.

   The Apostle speaks of "every joint" and "every part." We are many as
   well as one and it is a great Grace of God when men and women merge
   their individuality in the community of which they form a part.
   Remember, dear Friends, that you, by yourselves, are not the Church and
   you must not always keep on saying, "we," if you are not doing anything
   at all in connection with it! You are yourself and you must look upon
   yourself as a distinct individual--your first care, in the sight of
   God--must be concerning yourself. The body is made up of many bones,
   sinews, muscles, veins, arteries and so on, and each one has its
   special place and function. And each of you has a particular position
   and office in the corporate body which is called by the name of the
   Church.

   Think of your individuality and think of it thus. See that you are
   really united to the body. It does not matter how beautiful a member
   may be if it is not in the body, for it is not where it ought to
   be--and it is not where it will be of any service. There is an eye
   which has just been taken from a dead body. It lies on the operating
   table--what will you give for it? It is worth nothing and it must be
   put out of sight, for it is of no use. There is a finely-formed ankle,
   but it is useless apart from the rest of the body. How beautiful that
   leg is! Yes, but as it is not joined to a body, you must bury it out of
   sight. Now mark particularly what I am going to say and if any of you
   are wicked enough to misrepresent my words, on you will be the
   responsibility. This is what I say--Nobody can possibly have spiritual
   life unless he is joined to the Church. "Oh," somebody says, "Mr.
   Spurgeon said that people had no spiritual life unless they were
   members of his church." He did notsay anything of the kind and he never
   thought anything of the sort! "But he means that they must be members
   of the Baptist Church." He does not mean anything of the sort! "Oh, but
   he means that they must be members of some visible church!" Well, we
   would have to talk a little while about thatmatter, but I did notsay
   that and I did not mean it!

   I believe that every Christian ought to be joined to some visible
   Church--that is his plain duty according to the Scriptures. God's
   people are not dogs, otherwise they might go about one by one. They are
   sheep and, therefore, they should be in flocks. If I meet a man all by
   himself, snapping at everybody--I may be called uncharitable, but, I
   should hardly think that he was a sheep--I would be afraid that he was
   a dog. But when I see a man who consorts with his fellow men, feeds
   with them, takes delight in their company and with them draws near to
   the Great Shepherd of Souls, I say to myself, "I think he must be one
   of the sheep, for that is the way in which that animal always acts."
   So, Beloved, you should go in flocks or companies--that is to say, you
   should be joined to some Christian Church.

   But I was speaking just now of the Church. There is a Church which is
   the Church of Christ. I see it not, but it is visible to Him who bought
   it with His precious blood. The members of thatChurch are scattered up
   and down throughout all the world. Some are in this Church, some are in
   other churches, but Christ is causing that Church to grow up for
   Himself from the girlhood state, in which she now is, till she shall
   come to the measure of the perfect stature of what God designs her to
   be when she is ready to become "the bride, the Lamb's wife." This
   Church, chosen before all worlds, redeemed upon the Cross, quickened,
   fashioned and called out by degrees by the Holy Spirit and united to
   Christ, is the one of which you and I must be members, or else we shall
   be lost forever! See to it, then, dear Friends, that you are vitally
   joined to Christ's Church and specially that you are united to Him who
   is the Head of it.

   Next, we must be careful to find and keep our true position in that
   body. I call your attention to a point which may not seem to be as
   important as it really is. A body owes its beauty, comfort,
   healthfulness, happiness--perhaps its very life--to the position of the
   different members of which it is composed. Any book on anatomy will
   teach you that this is the case. There is no other place where our eyes
   could be but just where God has fixed them. Try whether you can find
   another position where your eyes could be so fitted for their work as
   where they now are. Our feet, with which we walk, are the best members
   to walk with and they are put in the proper place for that purpose.
   Suppose they were attached to our shoulders and we had to walk with
   them? I do not know how we would manage it. And if our hands were where
   our feet now are, it would be exceedingly awkward and difficult for us
   to use them. We would, indeed, be monstrosities rather than men if any
   part of us should be shifted from its present position! When men write
   romances about mythical beings, they describe hideous creatures whose
   heads are under their arms, or like the fabled Cyclops, with one eye in
   the middle of his forehead--but Christ's Church is not a monstrosity!
   Mind that you do not act as though you thought that she was.

   Try, dear Friends, to be in the body of Christ what you were meant to
   be. I have known some men who were very eager to preach. They have had
   wonderful gifts of dispersion, but no power to gather or hold a
   congregation together.

   They have fomented a quarrel within a month and split up the church
   into fragments in order to purge it from some fancied evil--and they
   have purged it till there is nobody left in it! They think that it is
   the wickedness of men which makes hearers unwilling to listen to them,
   whereas it is only their own folly. They, who might have been useful as
   ears, listening to somebody else, are altogether useless as a tongue!
   Do not get out of your position, Brother, if you are already in it. But
   if not, get into your right place as soon as you can and do there what
   the Lord would have you do. Some persons have a very great gift of
   finding fault with other people, but I do not know any place that God
   has arranged in the body for that particular faculty! It is a kind of
   disease or, rather, an evil spirit which needs to be cast out! If you
   who are thus afflicted would try to do something, yourselves, you would
   perhaps discover that while it is exceedingly easy to complain of
   others, it is more difficult to do your own work in such a way that
   people cannot justly find fault with you! Do, dear Friends, seek to
   have every joint and every part in their right place. Let every
   ligament and tendon of the body be just where it should be. If we were
   to put the doors of our houses where the windows now are--and to put
   the roof where the foundation stones are, we should have very strange
   houses--and you will not find a true Church of Christ unless every part
   of it is in its right place according to God's order and arrangement.

   A third thing about our individuality is that every part of the body
   should be careful of its own health. If I happen to be only like a
   little finger in the body of the Church, it is a great pity that I
   should be ill, for the whole body will be affected. If my little finger
   is full of some evil complaint, it may cause great inconvenience to my
   whole system. Did you ever have a splinter in your hand and yet the
   rest of your body did not know that anything was the matter? Instead of
   that being the case, your finger has been of greater consequence to you
   than all the other parts of your body when it has once begun to smart
   and to be full of pain--and to swell and fester! Now, you little
   members, you can do any quantity of mischief if you like. It is
   possible for a Christian to have so little Grace, and so much sin, that
   he may cause pain to the entire Church of God. for people will point to
   the most obscure of you if you do wrong! They will say, "That is one of
   the people that go to the Tabernacle and no doubt they are all alike."

   It is very unjust to say that we are all like the worst person we have
   among us. If we have one especially godly and gracious member, the
   world never says, "They are all like he." No, no! They say, "Ah, he is
   quite an exception! If they were all like he, then we would go there,
   too." But they take as their standard and test the most sickly and
   unhealthy in the whole flock. Therefore, I pray you, dear members of
   this Church, ask God to make each one of you healthy in spiritual
   things. Do not think you are of no importance. Never belittle yourself
   by saying, "It does not matter whether I pray, or whether I live near
   to God." It doesmatter, Brothers and Sisters, for it may give some of
   us the greatest pain if we see you behaving unworthily or living
   inconsistently with your profession. Therefore let your individuality
   lead you to see, first, that you are in the Church. Next, that you are
   in your right position in the Church. And then, that you are a healthy
   member of the Church, which is Christ's body.

   And, once more, be careful of your growth for the sake of the whole
   body. "Oh," you say, "I do not know that I need to grow I have believed
   in Christ and I am saved--that is enough for me." But, my dear Friend,
   you must grow because the whole Church of Christ is to grow! Suppose
   that, when I was a lad, one of the bones of my arm had persisted in not
   growing. If all the rest of my body had been properly developed--what
   would happen if that particular bone did not grow? Why, I would have a
   short arm! Suppose that one of the bones of your leg had said to
   itself, "I am in the body and that is enough for me! I do not mean to
   grow any more." You would have had to go hopping through the world with
   one short leg all your life--and that would have been a very
   uncomfortable thing for you--you would probably have had great pain as
   well as inconvenience. So, if one Christian in the Church does not
   grow, he will give trouble to others, for the next Brother to him is
   growing and it makes matters very awkward when some advance and others
   do not. I would like to have a Church composed of effective
   soldiers--but I suppose that I shall never have that. Usually we have a
   certain number of lame folk among us.

   We cannot leave them behind, yet they cannot fight in our ranks. We
   cannot do as Gideon did with his followers-- send the faint-hearted
   ones home. No, they will stay with us and their inefficiency cuts off a
   certain number of those who would be good for fighting, for they are so
   ill that they need somebody to wait upon them and, perhaps, a third of
   the Church has to be employed in driving the ambulances and attending
   to the invalids. Then, when the battle begins to get hot and we need
   all our regiments to the front, there is a certain number of soldiers
   who cannot stand fire--they turn their backs and so bring shame upon
   the Church. I wish it were not so, yet it often is because all are not
   of one heart and one soul--there is not the living unity that there
   ought to be, for then all would grow at the same rate and the body,
   growing harmoniously, would be strong and beautiful--and in the day of
   conflict it would be able to vanquish the foe. Look, then, to this
   matter, each one of you. Laggards, come on! You that have been
   slothful, quicken your pace! You that have been sick and weary, may God
   restore and refresh you, so that the whole body may be healthy and
   vigorous. So much, then, about our union to Christ and our
   individuality.

   III. Now for a few words about OUR RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER.

   The Apostle says a good deal here about joints--"That which every joint
   supplies." That expression conveys the idea of relationship and teaches
   us that we are, in our desire and spirit, to be fitted to work with
   others. This bone is so wisely constructed at this end that it fits
   into the next one and thus both work together. Our joints are very
   amazing things. This wrist joint is, perhaps, the most wonderful piece
   of mechanism in the world! The bones fit into each other so beautifully
   and work together so harmoniously. I know some Brothers who would make
   splendid men if all the rest of the people were dead, for they are very
   loving and amiable to themselves. They would be just the sort of folk
   to become hermits--shut them up in a cave with a bucket of water and a
   loaf of bread--and all their virtues would shine out! They have taken
   the motto which our Scotch friends link with the thistle and which I
   might freely translate--"Nobody shall touch me without catching it."
   Whoever comes near them, they are always upon their guard. They are
   sure that person means them no good, so they repel his advances at
   once.

   When we get such people as that into a Christian Church, it is very
   awkward for the rest of the members. It is as if we had bones in our
   body without any joints to them--they grate against each other and
   constantly wear each other away when they come into contact. Now, dear
   Friend, if you are in a Church, try to make yourself a bearable person
   as far as you can. Keep your own peculiarities, if they are worth
   retaining, yet do not display them so as to make yourself obnoxious!
   And do not let everybody, or even anybody, if you can help it, be
   obnoxious to you. Perhaps you have some bone joints outside of you--if
   so, then pray God to make those joints fit into the persons that happen
   to be near you. In this wondrously complex body of Christ, we need to
   be jointed all over so that we may, in our various relationships, be to
   others just what Christ would have us to be!

   Next, notice that the Apostle says that there is something "which every
   joint supplies." So there is. Every joint supplies oil and if there
   were not any, it might be very awkward for the rest of the system. In
   the Church of Christ, which is His body, we need the joint oil of love.
   If you are traveling by railway, you will see, when an express train
   pulls up, that a man goes round and puts fresh grease into the box to
   keep the wheels from firing. What a wonderful machine our body is, for
   it puts the grease into its own box and keeps all the joints right
   without friction by supplying them with its own oil! There are some
   Brothers and Sisters, with whom I come in contact, who expect me to
   find all the joint oil for them, but even then they are often very
   trying. Yet I must not lose my temper, or be at all hard with them!
   Well, I can supply the oil for my own joints, but you must put the oil
   into yours, or else we cannot work well together.

   Perhaps someone says that there is no love in the Church. Quite right,
   Brother. You mean that there is none in you! Your bones have no joint
   oil. But if you had your own measure of holy, hearty love to your
   Brothers and Sisters, I believe that you would find that some oil would
   exude out of them, for there are none of the bones of Christ's body
   that are quite dry. There is some oil in them all, although you may not
   know how to get at it. And some bodies that are called strange are so
   reckoned because, perhaps, they are better than we are. But if we could
   get at them in the right way, we would find them to be full of love and
   we would rejoice that we knew them. Do let every joint, therefore, take
   care to supply its oil when it comes into contact with the next bone.

   In this way, we would aid the compactness of the body. That is the
   expression in our text--"compacted by that which every joint supplies."
   When all the bones work well together, they greatly assist the
   compactness of the body, for the muscles, tendons and so forth bind the
   whole together. The bones of the body are its strength and give it
   compactness--and so strengthen certain other parts of the system that
   are soft and would give way if left to themselves. So, in every Church,
   when there is bad doctrine preached, there are certain pieces of flesh
   that seem to give way under the heretical touch. Yes, but you who are
   like the sturdy, stiff old bones that do not give way, you must just
   stand firm and steadfast in the faith, whatever is preached! Stand fast
   by the Truth of God under all opposition, for so you will give
   compactness and stability to the entire Church! I pray that we may
   always have, in this Christian community, a number of godly men and
   matrons who know what they know, so that when the younger sort are a
   little perplexed, they may go to them and say, "Tell us, dear Brothers
   and Sisters, are we right or wrong on these matters?" And they will
   say, "We have tasted and handled the good old Doctrines of Grace and we
   are afraid that you will go quite off the right lines if you accept
   these new notions. Therefore, cleave to the Truth which you have
   received." That is the way that the Church is made strong, by all the
   joints ministering the oil which holds it together, or helps to the
   harmonious working of all-- the bones being themselves confirmed while
   strengthening others.

   Besides that, let every member offer his own services to the Church.
   Let each one be doing what he or she can. No one minister, no 20
   ministers, no elders, if there were a hundred, no deacons, if there
   were a thousand, could ever fulfill all the ministries of the Church!
   God has given Apostles, Evangelists, pastors, teachers and so forth to
   bring the Bread of Life to us. That is the outward feeding of the
   flock, but, then, each living person must take the food into
   himself--the Church must edify itself. There must go on, within the
   Church, the proper processes of digestion and assimilation of the Truth
   of God, the reception of and yielding to the Spirit of God by which the
   Church is built up by itself, as well as by all the external influences
   which God has prepared for its strengthening and increase.

   IV. Now I must close, for our time has gone, by only a few sentences
   concerning OUR COMPACT UNITY AS A

   CHURCH.

   The Church of God should be one, but not piled into one heap. It should
   be one in Christ Jesus by a living union. May I ask each one of you
   whether it is so? Is the life of God in you, dear Brother, dear Sister?
   If it is and you feel that it is the same life which is in the other
   members, then you have a unity of the most indestructible kind--one
   which never can be broken! This union must be a growingunion. We ought
   so to grow continually as to love each other better and bear with each
   other more and more. It is often my prayer for this Church, when I am
   anxiously thinking of the great work here, that nothing may ever arise
   to divide us in spirit and in love to each other. It is, to my mind, a
   standing miracle that all these years [Almost 30 years.--EO.] we have
   been bound together in the unity of the Spirit and in the bonds of
   peace. But, for the years that are yet to come, shall we quarrel with
   one another? Shall there be a root of bitterness to spring up and
   trouble us? I see no trace or sign of it at present, but before it does
   appear, I beg of you, by the years in which we have worked together, by
   the blessings we have been made to see, by the benefits which God has
   given to thousands of souls by this Church, let us not tear this
   garment of Christ, let us not do anything in any way by which our union
   may be marred. But let us be "compacted by that which every joint
   supplies."

   I may be speaking to some friends who are a little out of temper with a
   Brother or Sister. Go and settle the difficulty at once. Resolve in
   your heart that you will settle it tonight if possible. If you have any
   disagreements, if there is any coldness at all between you, before you
   come to this Table, bury it all! Get closer to Christ and then get
   closer to one another--and may our blessed Lord, when He comes, find us
   all one in Him! We ask it for His dear name's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 1:1-12.

   Verses 1, 2. Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers
   scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
   elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
   sanctifcation of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
   of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace be multiplied. How sweetly
   the Apostle is obeying his Master's command, "When you are converted,
   strengthen your brethren." This is the same Peter who once began to
   sink beneath the waves, yet now he is helping others to stand! This is
   the very Peter who denied his Master, but he begins his Epistle by
   acknowledging himself to be "an Apostle of Jesus Christ." What wonders
   the Lord Jesus had worked for Peter by His Grace! It is no marvel,
   therefore, that he should say to others, "Grace unto you, and peace be
   multiplied."

   3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
   according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. And, truly,
   this is a blessing beyond all comparison or imagination, that we have
   been begotten again by the Divine Father unto a "living" hope, for that
   is a better rendering than, "lively." Our first birth brought us into
   sin and sorrow, but our second birth brings us into purity and joy. We
   were born to die--now are we born never to die, "begotten again" unto a
   life that shall remain in us forevermore--a life which shall even
   penetrate these mortal bodies and make them immortal, "by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

   4, 5. To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiledd, and that fades
   not away, reserved in Heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God
   through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
   Joy, my Brothers and Sisters, in the glorious inheritance which is
   prepared for you--unstained, uncorrupted, perfectly pure and,
   therefore, to last forever because the elements which produce decay are
   not in it! It is without sin and, therefore, it shall be without end.
   What a mercy it is to be "kept by the power of God"! See, Heaven is
   kept for us and we are kept for Heaven! Heaven is prepared for us and
   we are prepared for Heaven! There is a double action of God's Grace
   thus working in us and working for us unto eternal bliss!

   6. Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
   you are in heaviness through manifold temptations. Or "trials." Some
   people cannot comprehend how a man can greatly rejoice and yet be in
   heaviness at the same time. But there are many things, in a Christian's
   experience, that cannot be understood except by those who experience
   them! And even they find many a mystery which can only be expressed by
   a paradox. There are some who think that God's people should never be
   heavy in spirit, but the Apostle says, "Now for a season, if need be,
   you are in heaviness." He does not say, "If need be, you are in
   manifold trials," but, "If need be, you are in heaviness through
   manifold trials," for the "need be" is as much for the depressed spirit
   as for the trials themselves.

   7, 8. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
   gold that perishes, though it is tried with fire, might be found unto
   praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: whom
   having not seen, we love; in whom, though now you see Him not, yet
   believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. And does
   not the joy agree well with the Object of it? Paul said, "Thanks be
   unto God for His unspeakable gift." And Peter, speaking of the same
   Savior, says, "In whom, though now you see Him not, yet believing, you
   rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."

   9-11. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
   souls. Of which salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched
   diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
   searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was
   in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
   Christ, and the glory that should follow. Do you wonder if, sometimes,
   you find in the Bible a Truth which you cannot quite comprehend? You
   ought not to marvel, for even the Prophets, who prophesied of the Grace
   which has come to us, did not always fully understand their own
   messages! I am sure that their Inspiration was verbal because the
   Inspired men frequently did not, themselves, know the meaning of what
   they were moved to write.

   12. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
   they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them
   that havepreached the Gospel unto you which the Holy Spirit sent down
   from Heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. See the kind
   of preaching that we should all desire to hear and that all God's
   ministers should aim at? "Them that have preached the Gospel unto you
   which the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven." Nothing but a Gospel full
   of the energy of the Holy Spirit and set on fire by Him can effect the
   eternal purposes of God! And this is the kind of preaching that will
   live and that will also make men live! God send it to every Church and
   congregation throughout the world! Amen.

Wakeful and Watchful Eyes

   (No. 2654)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 24, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 13, 1882.

   "Behold, He that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep." Psalm
   121:4.

   "Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters,
   and as the eyes ofa maiden unto the hands of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the LORRD our God, until He has mercy on us."

   Psalm 123:2.

   NOTICE, dear Friends, that both these texts begin with the word,
   "Behold." That word is meant to attract the readers' attention. In some
   books, which are intended to be sensational, you are asked to
   behold--and when you look, there is nothing to see! But when God's Word
   bids you behold what it has to say, you may be sure that the
   exclamation is not superfluous or misleading! It would be a marring of
   the Word of God to leave out even one of its smallest expressions and,
   therefore, when we see this word, "Behold," placed at the beginning of
   each of these texts, we may rest assured that there is, in both of
   them, something worth noting, worth examining and considering--and
   worth remembering and carrying away!

   A very useful series of discourses might be preached upon the "Beholds"
   of the Old and New Testaments which culminate in John the Baptist's,
   "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world," and
   Pilate's, "Behold the Man." And still more in our Lord's own message to
   John, "Behold, I come quickly." But two Old Testament, "Beholds," are
   to furnish us with a theme of meditation at this time. It is somewhat
   singular that they both relate to eyes. The first tells us about God's
   eyes--"Behold, He that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep."
   His eyes are never closed. No feeling of weariness or need of slumber
   ever causes them to be heavy and to shut. And the second text tells us
   about our eyes--"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of
   their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
   mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until He has mercy on
   us."

   See, Brothers and Sisters, both our texts speak about eyes, and they
   ask for the use of our eyes by saying, "Behold," which is as though God
   said to us, "I am going to tell you about My eyes which never slumber.
   Therefore, look and see, for you shall find them always open and always
   watching over you." Then the next text tells us about our eyes and
   reminds us how God gives to His people clear and quick eyesight, so
   that they observe all the motions of their Master's hands and are glad
   to note them--and prompt to do as He directs. I have put these two
   texts together because I hoped that when you saw with joy how the eyes
   of the Lord are upon the righteous and His ears open to their cries,
   you would then feel that it was a fit return that your eyes should be
   unto the Lord your God, and that your ears should be open to receive
   His teaching and to learn His commands. God grant that this may be the
   result of the sermon upon these two texts!

   I. First, then, I am to speak to you concerning THE WAKEFUL EYES OF THE
   LORD OUR GOD. We are told, in our first text, that the Lord, who keeps
   Israel, shall neither slumber nor sleep.

   We learn from these words, first, that the Lord keeps Israel. Read the
   121st Psalm through and you will find the word, "preserve," or, "keep,"
   or, "keeper," repeated many times. God has Himself undertaken the work
   of keeping His people--it is His high office to preserve those who are
   His chosen ones!

   "He that keeps Israel." By this expression we understand that the Lord
   keeps His people as a shepherd keeps his flock. There is a great depth
   of meaning in that word, "keep," as it is thus used, for a shepherd
   keeps the sheep by feeding them, by supplying all their needs and also
   by guarding them from all their adversaries. He keeps the flock with
   vigilance so that it is not diminished either by the ravaging wolf or
   by the straying of the sheep. Even an ordinary shepherd takes great
   pains and the utmost care to preserve his sheep both by night and by
   day--while, "our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep," who was
   brought again from the dead, uses His Omnipotence, His Omniscience and
   all His Divine Attributes in the keeping of His sheep! O Beloved, if
   you are, indeed, His people and the sheep of His pasture, rest assured
   that He will preserve you! You are in good keeping, for He is the Good
   Shepherd, and the Great Shepherd, and the Chief Shepherd and He will
   perform all the duties of His office well and faithfully, that He may
   securely keep all whom His Father has committed unto Him!

   Another figure may equally well illustrate the meaning of this
   expression. The Lord keeps His people, not only as a shepherd keeps his
   sheep, but as a king keeps his jewels. These are rare and precious
   things which are his peculiar treasure and he will not lose them if he
   can help it. He will go to war sooner than be deprived of them. He will
   put them in the most secure case that he has in his strong room--and
   set his most faithful servants to guard the place wherein they are
   stored. He will charge those who have the custody of his crown jewels
   to take a full and accurate account of them--and to be careful to
   examine them, from time to time, to see that they are all there, for he
   greatly prizes them and is not willing for one of them to be lost. They
   probably cost him a great price, or, if not, they are part of his royal
   heritage and of the glory and honor of his kingdom, so he desires to
   keep them all. Even so does the Lord Jesus keep His people, for they
   are His jewels. He delights in them--they are His honor and His glory!
   They cost Him a greater price than they can ever realize. He hides them
   away in the case of His power and protects them with all His wisdom and
   strength. Concerning those who feared the Lord and thought upon His
   name, it is written, "They shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in
   that day when I make up My jewels." It is God's work to keep His own
   jewels. He does not commit them even to the custody of the tall
   archangel who stands nearest to His Throne, but the Lord, Himself,
   keeps them--and no one shall be able to pluck them out of His hands!

   This is not all, for we might multiply figures to almost any extent and
   still not exhaust the meaning of the text. The Lord keeps His people as
   a governor keeps the city committed to his charge. He places his guards
   around the walls, he has his cannon on the battlements to defend the
   place against those who besiege it. And he is constantly on the watch.
   Early in the morning and late at night he is on the walls--and through
   the night, the watchmen keep their continual rounds, for the city must
   be preserved from scaling ladders and from assaults of every sort. The
   Lord will not let even the suburbs of the New Jerusalem be conquered by
   the foe! He will preserve the holy city, His own Church, until the day
   when His Son shall come to reign in her forever.

   I find that in all probability, the figure here used is an allusion to
   the common custom of having guards to watch the tents of travelers
   passing through the desert. At this very time, if you were journeying
   through the Holy Land, you would find that when you came to your
   camping ground, and nightfall drew on, there would be certain persons
   employed to watch over the different tents, for, otherwise, the
   wandering robbers of the desert would soon enter and take away your
   valuables, or even your life. I have noticed in the books of two or
   three travelers, this observation, "We found it exceedingly difficult
   to obtain a tent-keeper who could stay awake all night." One gentleman
   speaks of discovering a thief in his tent and when he went outside to
   call the watchman, he found that the man had gone so soundly to sleep
   that he could only be awakened by one or two gentle kicks! When a man
   has been traveling with you all day, it is unreasonable to expect him
   to stay awake through the night to take care of you. Therefore, see the
   beauty of the expression used by the Psalmist, "Behold, He that keeps
   Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep." There shall be no deep sleep
   falling upon Him! No, there shall not even be a brief period of
   slumber, not even a wink of sleep shall ever overcome Him! A man may
   say, "I am so tired that I cannot keep my eyes open," but God never
   says that.

   Now turn to the second part of our first text--"Behold, He that keeps
   Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep," and think, first, of God's
   eyes as never wearying of His people. I suppose that the fondest mother
   is sometimes glad when she can put her children to bed and have a
   little quiet time by herself. She at last grows weary even of their
   pretty ways and she is willing to let them go out of her sight for a
   while. But the Lord never grows weary of His people. If some of you had
   such children as God has, you would never be able to endure their
   trying ways. None but the God of Infinite patience could bear with such
   a family as He has. Any one of us might exhaust the patience of a
   hundred Jobs rolled into one-- yet, shout it out and let even the
   angels hear it--we have not exhausted the patience of God! He has never
   been so wearied and worried by us as to say, "I must go to sleep, My
   children, and leave you to take care of yourselves." Our Savior's eyes
   are never weary of looking on us--those eyes that closed upon the Cross
   and then that opened, again, on the Resurrection morning, like bright
   stars. Those eyes that, from the heights of Heaven, have looked down
   upon the redeemed with ineffable delight of love--those eyes never grow
   weary of the chosen ones! Our Lord Jesus has such joy in His people as
   keeps Him from ever being weary of them. That is one meaning of His
   never slumbering or sleeping.

   The next is, that God is never forgetful of His people for a single
   moment You and I forget things which we most need to remember. Have you
   not, my Sister, often shifted your ring from one finger to another and
   then had to say to yourself, "How did it come to be here?" And then you
   remembered the reason why you removed it? Yes, I know you have done so
   and we have had a hundred ingenious inventions to keep us in mind of
   something that we wished not to forget-- yet we have forgotten it,
   after all. The fondest human heart at times forgets, but that Divine
   heart, alone, never does. And those eyes which look down on us with
   Infinite love flashing forth from them are never sealed in the slumber
   of for-getfulness. We forget all things in our sleep and lie completely
   indifferent to all that is happening around us, but God never does
   so--He never forgets us and He is never indifferent to us. Oh, what a
   blessed Truth of God this is!

   Sleep also throws us into a condition in which we are incapable of
   helping ourselves. But God is never in such a state as that. He is
   always awake to show Himself strong on the behalf of those who trust
   Him. You will never have to call to Him in vain, or get from Him the
   answer, "I cannot help you right now." Elijah, in his irony, said that
   perhaps Baal was sleeping, or on a journey, and the idol god was quite
   unable to deliver those that called upon him. But our God, who made the
   heavens, is quick to hear the faintest cry of any of His people! He is
   perpetually girt with all might and energy--if you do but appeal to
   Him, He will speedily fly to your relief! Yes, He will fly upon the
   wings of the wind, for He is prompt to deliver all those who put their
   case into His hands. God is never asleep in the sense that He is unable
   to help us.

   And, moreover, God is never asleep in the sense that He ceases to
   consider us. I do not know whether you can catch the thought so as to
   lay hold of it by faith, but we have an instance of it in the 40th
   Psalm where David says, "I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinks upon
   me." When? Now? Yes. Tomorrow? Yes. And yesterday? Yes. He was
   alwaysthink-ing of us and He is always thinking of us! The Infinite
   mind of God can think of all things at once. You and I, in thinking of
   one thing, often forget another--but it is not so with God. He is so
   great that His center is everywhere and His circumference is nowhere!
   And you, dear Brother or Sister, may be the very center of God's
   thoughts and so may I--and all His redeemed may at the same moment have
   His thoughts fixed upon each one of them! Can you realize the wondrous
   Truth of God that there is never a moment, night or day, in which the
   great mind of the Eternal ceases to think of you? Then, how safe you
   are with God always looking upon you! How happy you ought to be with
   God always thinking of you! Yes, how joyful you ought to be because,
   even if others forget you, He never does!

   You remember how Cowper represents Alexander Selkirk, when far away an
   that island of Juan Fernandez, saying--

   "My friends, do they now and then send A wish or a thought after me?"

   He could not bear, in his loneliness, to be altogether forgotten by
   everybody. And none of us would like to be in that condition, but even
   if we were in such a plight, we could still find comfort in that
   ancient promise, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
   not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget." It
   is rarely enough that mothers are so unnatural--still, "they may
   forget. Yet," says the LORD, "will I not forget you." Oh, drink that
   down! Is it not a sweet draught? Of all the luscious drinks that men
   ever delighted in, there can be none with such flavor as this choice
   wine of Covenant faithfulness!

   So much, then, for our first text, "Behold, He that keeps Israel shall
   neither slumber nor sleep." I have only given you a few brief hints.
   Lay them up in your memories and come with me to consider our second
   text, "Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
   masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
   our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until He has mercy on us."

   II. The lesson of these words is that THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE SAINTS
   ARE FIXED UPON THEIR GOD.

   Which is the more wonderful text of the two? Certainly, it is a great
   marvel that God should always fix His eyes upon us, but I think it is a
   greater marvel that you and I should ever be brought to fix our eyes on
   God! For God to look at His people is according to His own Nature, but
   for usto look upon God, is something superior to human nature--it is
   the giftof God and the work of Sovereign Grace! I think that both looks
   are to be regarded as miracles of mercy. For a child of God to be so
   sanctified that He always fixes His eyes upon God, as a servant does
   upon his master's hands--this is a very eminent degree of
   sanctification and is a thing worthy to be looked at, and worthy to
   have the word, "Behold," put before it! I wonder whether you and I have
   yet reached such a height of consecration to God as to be able to truly
   use the language of this text?

   Alas, in many cases we cannot get men's eyes fixed upon God at all.
   There is this natural world, with all its wondrous beauty. God has
   painted every flower and tinged the clouds with the glory of the
   setting sun. He is everywhere and yet men walk through His great house
   of nature and--fools that they are--they say, "There is no God." It is
   hard to get men to see God. We put the Bible into their hands. They
   read it and are interested in its stories, but they see not God in it.
   Providence comes to their very doors with marvels, yet they say that
   they do not see God's hand in anything that happens to them! And even
   when we preach--and this is the woe of woes--we cannot get men to look
   to the Lord! God knows that I have never tried to speak that you would
   think of mefor a single moment. I have sought to tell my tale as
   plainly as I could and to force it home on man's hearts and consciences
   as God might help me. And yet, at the end of the sermon, often the
   hearer's only remark is, "How did you like him?" It does not matter at
   all how you like me! Is that what we came here for--to fiddle to you,
   as men do in your orchestras, or speak before you as if we were mere
   actors playing for your amusement? It is of no concern to us what you
   think of our style or manner--it is the Truth of God itself which we
   would drive home to you! It is that Truth of God which, if we could, we
   would make you feel as the ox feels the sharp goad! It is the blessed
   Doctrine of Christ Crucified which we would have you feed upon, as the
   hungry man devours the bread that is given to him and does not care
   whether he ever knows the baker's name, or not! Still, I must say again
   that it is a hard thing to get men to see God. They look around, above,
   beneath, everywhere--but to get them to fix their eyes upon God, "This
   is the work. This is the difficulty."

   The man of God who wrote this 123rd Psalm had been taught to look to
   God in a very remarkable manner. And I call your attention to it in the
   hope that many of you will do likewise. First, his eyes were
   reverentially fixed upon the Lord. He looked to God's hands, wherever
   they were, with deep reverence--"as the eyes of servants look unto the
   hands of their masters." He was, of course, talking about Oriental
   servants--the Hebrew word bears the meaning of slaves--and travelers
   tell us that when they go into the house of a wealthy person in the
   East, the master will give certain signs to his slaves and refreshments
   are brought in. But, except when they are called, the servants stand at
   a distance, watching for the slightest motion of their master's
   hands--they do not have the liberties that we happily accord to our
   servants--they are nothing and nobody, mere tools for their master to
   use as he pleases. And, as to the maidens, I have heard that the women
   in the East have a harder time of it with their mistresses than the men
   do with their masters and that the lady of the house is a more severe
   taskmaster than her husband is. So the maidens watch their mistress'
   hands very carefully, for they are sorely afraid of them--and they look
   with great care and fear to see what "Madam" would have them do. Now,
   casting aside everything of human fear out of the figure, this is the
   way in which we ought to look to God--He is in Heaven--we are upon
   earth. He is great--we are nothing. He is good--we are lumps of sin. It
   is for us, therefore, with the utmost reverence, to seek to learn God's
   will in every point--in His Word and in His works--and at once, without
   question, reverently to do what He commands us.

   The next point is that the truly sanctified man looks to God's hands
   with obedience as well as with reverence. Orientals, as a general rule,
   speak far less than we do, except when they sit around the fire at
   eventide and tell their tales. But an Eastern master seldom speaks. A
   gentleman went, some time ago, into an Eastern house and as soon as he
   entered, the master waved his hand and the servants brought in sherbet.
   He waved his hand again, and they brought dried fruits. Then he moved
   his hands in a different way and they began to spread the table and,
   all the time, not a word was spoken, but they perfectly understood the
   motion of his hands! They had to look sharply to see how the master
   moved his hands so that they might do what that motion meant. We have
   not very much of that dumb action among us, but, on board a steamboat
   you may see the captain moving his hands this way or that, and the
   call-boy is ready at once to pass the word down to those who are in
   charge of the engine.

   That is just how the child of God should watch the hands of God in the
   Bible and in Providence, so as to do at once whatever we plainly
   perceive to be our Lord's will. Ah, me, I know some professing
   Christians who will not do God's will till they have had a good
   whipping, or not until they have been chastened again and again!
   Remember that ancient injunction, "Be you not as the horse, or as the
   mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit
   and bridle, lest they come near unto you"? You know how the drivers
   have to pull at their reins. They say, "This creature is so hard in the
   mouth that we do not know how to manage him at all." And some of God's
   people are terribly hard in the mouth--they need very rough handling to
   make them move. Yet we ought to be different from horses and mules. We
   ought to be ready at once, at a beck, or a wink, or a nod, to know what
   God would have us do--and do it reverently and obediently.

   Then, also, our eyes should be absolutely fixed upon our Lord. The eyes
   of servants ought to be so directed to their masters that they not only
   see the sign, but obey it, whatever it means. It may be a very little
   thing, but yet the little thing should not be neglected. I would again
   say what I sometimes feel ashamed of having to say. I sometimes meet
   with a person who says, with regard to the matter of Believers'
   Baptism, "Now, you know that Baptism will not save me." You evil,
   miserable soul! Will you do nothing but what is necessary for your
   salvation? Is that the spirit that drives you? Will you do only what is
   necessary to save your poor soul, which is hardly worth saving if you
   talk like that? It is too small a thing to be worth anything, but
   unless Baptism will save your soul, you will not attend to it? "Well,"
   says another, "I have reversed the Scriptural order--I have put my
   baptism before my believing." Who gave you leave to alter the Lord's
   order? If servants were to act like that, what mischief we would have!
   Suppose they were to bring us in our dessert before they brought in our
   dinner--that would be a very small affair, yet it is important to
   observe the right order even in such matters! Or suppose we were to
   tell them to sweep the room and dust it--and they should dust the room
   and then sweep it? It is only altering the order, but you know what
   would happen! So is it with those who put Baptism first and believing
   afterwards--it spoils the whole transaction--and it violates the
   intention of God in the ordinance. You have no right to act like that!

   I may remind you of a story which I think I told you some time ago. A
   poor youth earnestly wished to join the Church, but his friends thought
   he was somewhat deficient in brain power and that he had better not be
   baptized. He lay sick and was evidently dying. And he said to his
   mother, "Mother, I wish I had been baptized and joined the Church." She
   replied, "My dear boy, you know that being baptized would not have
   saved you. You will go to Heaven because you have trusted in the Lord
   Jesus Christ." "Oh, yes," he said, "I know that! You do not think I am
   so stupid as to fancy that Baptism would save me, do you, Mother? I
   know that has nothing to do with going to Heaven! But when I get there,
   I shall see my Savior and, perhaps He will say to me, 'Isaac, why did
   you not join the Church?' If I should say, 'Lord, that was a very
   little thing,' He would say, 'Yes, then you might have done it to
   please Me.'" That story is just to the point-- the smaller the matter
   is, the more careful we should be to attend to it, if it would please
   the Lord Jesus Christ! Do not be so clever, you servants who fancy that
   you know better than your Master, for perhaps He may find somebody else
   to be His servant if you behave like that!

   Suppose that I was starting on a journey, early in the morning, and I
   said to my servant, "I would like a cup of coffee before I start"? And
   suppose that when I came down, she brought me a glass of cold water? I
   would ask her, "Why did you do that?" If she should reply, "Oh, Sir, I
   thought that the water would be better for you than coffee!" I would
   say, "Well, I am very much obliged to you for thinking of me in that
   considerate way, but I shall have to engage another servant who does
   what she is told." So I advise you not to alter or judge God's Word,
   but to obey it! Do not begin to calculate as to whether what you read
   in His Word is right in your sight, or in the eyes of other people--the
   one question for you is--Has my Lord bid me do this? If so, then, as
   the eyes of the maiden are to her mistress, so let your eyes be unto
   the Lord your God!

   Once more, our eyes are to be turned ONLY to the Lord. The Eastern
   servant is not allowed to think. It is no business of his to have his
   eyes upon his master's guests. They are to be fixed upon his master.
   And the maiden does not think it to be her business to watch the
   movements of the hands of the lady who calls to see her mistress--her
   eyes are to be on the hands of her mistress. She does not dare to take
   them off, for, perhaps, just when she is looking out of the window, or
   gazing in curiosity at some object, her mistress may be waving her hand
   and she may not see it. And then there will be a serious scolding and
   possibly something worse when the mistress gets her alone. So you and I
   must not take our eyes off our God at any time--His way and His will
   must be our only law--and for this we must live, that we may please Him
   whose servants we are, for has He not bought us with His precious
   blood? So we are not our own, we are "bought with a price."

   "Ah," says one, "we have not come to that yet." No, I fear you have
   not, but you ought to. There is no peace for us till we do. He who,
   either by omission or commission, neglects to do or goes beyond His
   Lord's command will find sorrow in his soul. Depend upon it, the roots
   of our most bitter griefs strike into our sins and, if our sins were
   overcome, the major part of our sorrows would be removed! Oh that God
   would give us Grace to be very tender in conscience, to tremble before
   Him, as well as to rejoice before Him, for in very deed the man who
   does not tremble at His Word has not yet learned to truly love Him!

   Now I must speak to some here who, perhaps, know nothing about what I
   have been saying, for they have lived without God. I will finish my
   sermon by just reminding you that this may do very well for this
   world--though it is a poor business at the best--but when you come to
   die, you will need God! Now, when I die and go to be with God, I know
   that Christ will not say to me, "I never knew you." I am sure He cannot
   because He has long known me. I was about to say that He has known me
   to His cost, for I have long been a beggar at His door every day and I
   cannot live without Him. I am naked, poor and miserable apart from Him.
   I have always some errand or other to make me go to Him--some sin to
   confess, or some need to be supplied. So He knows me well enough. You
   are sure to know a beggar who is always at your door. Perhaps he says
   that he has not been there before, but you reply, "Why you have been
   here every morning for the last six weeks! I have always seen you
   begging here the first thing in the morning." You cannot say that you
   do not know him, yet that is what will happen to those of you who have
   never sought the Lord Jesus Christ and never prayed to Him. Christ will
   say to you, "I never knew you."

   I feel that the spot I occupy just now is a very solemn one, for, like
   the captain of a ship, I can see all over this place. Often, when I
   come here on a Sunday, somebody says, "So-and-So has gone." There is
   one gone out of that seat which you occupy, my Friend. He was there
   last Sabbath, but he has gone. And I can point to many of you and say,
   "You are sitting in the seat where one used to sit whose face was vary
   familiar to me, but he has gone Home." And some go to my great
   surprise. I have thought to see them again many times, and when I have
   missed them, I have said, "Oh, she has gone to the seaside for a little
   holiday." But someone has said to me, "No, she is dead. She was
   suddenly taken away." Or, "He was called away only this last week." Ah,
   me! Ah, me! And what faces I may be looking into now that I shall never
   see again! Give me your hand, my Friend, for this is the last time I
   may ever speak to you. I beg you to get ready to go on that last long
   journey. Oh, do not die unsaved! I beseech you, do not attempt to enter
   the eternal world, with all its dread, without a Savior!

   This is the way of salvation. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! Trust
   yourself with Him! Put your soul, as a sacred deposit, into the hands
   of that dear Banker whose bank has never failed--no, more--who has
   never lost a penny that was entrusted to Him! And before you sleep,
   just rest in Jesus. God help you to do so, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"--194, 119 (SONG VI), 123, 538.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JEREMIAH30:1-22.

   Verses 1, 2. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, Thus
   speaks the LORD God ofIsrael, saying, Write you all the words that I
   have spoken unto you in a book We believe in Verbal Inspiration and,
   though some people treat with contempt the very ides of words being
   Inspired, be you sure of this, if you have not Inspired Words, you are
   not likely to get Inspired men! Besides, words are to the thought what
   the shell is to the egg and if you break the shell, you have destroyed
   the egg. Somehow or other, the thought will ooze out unless it is
   conveyed in God's own Words. Observe that the Lord does not say to
   Jeremiah, "Write you all the thoughtthat I have given you," but, "Write
   you all the wordsthat I have spoken unto you in a book."

   3. For, lo, the days come, says the LORD, that I will bring again the
   captivity of My people Israel and Judah, says the LORD: and I will
   cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they
   shall possess it And so they did, and so they shall in a yet fuller
   sense, for this is a promise that has fulfillments and fulfillments.
   Man's promises, once kept, are ended, but God's promises are
   perpetual--they are springing wells which never run dry! That which He
   fulfilled once, He often takes the opportunity to fulfill again on a
   yet larger scale, as He will doubtless do to His ancient people in the
   latter days. You who are in spiritual captivity tonight may derive
   comfort from these words, "I will bring again the captivity of My
   people." It is the way of God to deliver the captives. What He does
   once is only an index of what He is in the habit of doing. It is God's
   delight to devise means by which He will bring back His banished ones.
   So, in due time, He will end your captivity and you shall enjoy the
   blessed liberty which is the portion of His people.

   4, 5. And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and
   concerning Judah. For thus says the LORD, We have heard a voice of
   trembling, of fear, and not of peace. God hears His people's voices
   when they cry. He knows the tone and accent which they use and,
   sometimes, when He is listening to them, He hears "a voice of
   trembling, of fear, and not of peace." Possibly that may be the
   condition of some who are here tonight. If so, may the Lord, who hears
   their cry, bring them out of their trembling and fear--and fill their
   mouth with laughter and their tongue with singing!

   6, 7. Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child?
   Therefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in
   travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? Alas! for that day is
   great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble;
   but he shall be saved out of it This passage evidently alludes to a
   time of very great distress, when men's hearts were swollen within them
   as if they would burst for very grief. Not simply here and there one,
   but the great mass of the people seemed to be in sore trouble. Even the
   stout-hearted ones began to feel inward pangs of affliction, yet it was
   then that the Lord said, "It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but
   he shall be saved out of it."

   8. For it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD ofHosts, that I
   will break his yoke from offyour neck, and will burst your bonds, and
   strangers shall no more serve themselves of him. Here is a word for you
   tried ones! God, who sometimes permits His child to wear the yoke of
   the oppressor, will take that yoke away! He will snap the bands that
   are around your neck and enable you to rise into the glorious liberty
   wherewith Christ makes His people free! O enslaved ones, be of good
   comfort and look for speedy deliverance through the power of the great
   Emancipator!

   9, 10. But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king,
   whom I will raise up unto them. Therefore fear you not, O My servant
   Jacob, says the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will
   save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and
   Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall
   make him afraid. There are great things in reserve for God's ancient
   people Israel, but there are not less laid up for God's spiritual
   Israel, for by them shall the greatest fulfillment of the promise be
   realized! They shall indeed be quiet and none shall make them afraid.
   Note that these are the very men who had their hands upon their loins
   and whose faces were pale with fright! These are they who were ready to
   die of heartbreak! Yet even they shall, by the rich Grace of God, be in
   rest and quiet--and no one shall make them afraid. I wish that we could
   all realize the fulfillment of that promise even now and that our
   gracious God would dwell with us as He is known to abide with those who
   bear His name and thus give us that blessed quiet and rest which we so
   much need.

   11. For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you: though I make a full
   end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet will I not make a
   full end of you: but I will correct you in measure, and will not leave
   you altogether unpunished. Look abroad and see what God has done to
   Israel. This is peculiarly the time of Israel's trouble and the Jewish
   people were, perhaps, never worse persecuted than they now are in
   certain parts of the world. Yet the Lord will not allow any nation to
   crush them and He will, Himself, avenge all wrongs that they suffer. He
   still says to them, "He that touches you touches the apple of My eye."
   And it is very noteworthy that whenever God has used any nation as a
   rod to chasten the Jews--and He has used many in that way--He has
   always broken that kingdom up when He is done with it. Think of
   Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome. Look at Spain and see how mean and
   despicable that nation has become because of its cruelty to the people
   of God. Now, if this is true of Israel after the flesh, depend upon it
   that it is also true concerning God's spiritual people! Though He will
   correct us when we deserve chastening, it will always be in measure and
   He will not make a full end of us. God has measureless wrath against
   the ungodly for their measureless sin, but as for His own people, He
   has cast their sin behind His back and only as a wise and faithful
   Father does He chasten them for that sin.

   12-14. For thus says the LORD, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound
   is grievous. There is none to pleadyour cause, that you may be bound
   up. You have no healing medicines. All your lovers have forgotten you;
   they seek you not;

   for Ihave wounded you with thee wound ofan enemy, with the chastisement
   of a cruel one, for the multitude ofyour iniquity; because your sins
   were increased. God never gave His people leave to sin--and sin in them
   is worse than sin in any other people, for they sin against more light,
   more love and, therefore, it grieves the Lord more--and He smites all
   the more heavily and, mark you, when God smites, there is nobody who
   can comfort us! A quaint old writer, whose book I was reading the other
   day, commenting on that part of the parable where the friend, disturbed
   at midnight, said, "My children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and
   give to you," wrote something like this, "When God is in bed, there are
   none of His children up to help us. If He does not open the door, there
   are none of His saints to give us a crust--all must come from Him."
   Therefore we must cry unto Him and say, "Awake for my help, O God; for
   all my lovers have forgotten me; they seek me not in the time of my
   distress." When God wounds us, men often desert us--and those that
   seemed to be most fond of us forsake us when God smites us.

   15, 16. Why do you cry for your affliction? Your sorrow is incurable
   for the multitude ofyour iniquity: because your sins were increased, I
   have done these things to you. Therefore all they that devour you shall
   be devoured. How striking is this sentence! And what a surprise it
   gives us as we read it! We might have thought, after the Lord had
   spoken as He did, that He would have given His people up to their
   enemies, but, instead of doing so, He says, "Therefore all they that
   devour you shall be devoured;"

   16, 17. And all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into
   captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all thatprey
   upon you will 1give for a prey. For I willrestore health unto you, andl
   willhealyou ofyour wounds, says the LORD; because they called you an
   outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after. Did you notice
   that word, "therefore," in the 16th verse? Can you see any,
   "therefore," in it--any logical conclusion that could be drawn from the
   Prophet's premises? The argument seems to be, "Because your disease is
   incurable, therefore will I restore health unto you. Because no one
   else can heal your wounds, therefore I will heal them." It is a blessed
   thing to feel that you are incurable, for then it is that God will cure
   you! When there is an end of you, then you shall begin with God! But as
   long as you are full of self or sin, that passage shall be fulfilled to
   you, "He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He has
   sent away empty."

   18, 19. Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
   Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city
   shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the
   manner thereof And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the
   choice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they
   shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small
   Well might the Lord introduce such a promise as this with the word,
   "Behold"!

   Again I remind you that these are the people who had their hands on
   their loins! These are they who were in sore trouble of soul! Yet now
   they are merry and full of gladness! And we, also, have learned to
   sing--

   My mourning He to dancing turns, For sackcloth, joy He gives, A moment,
   Lord, Your anger burns, But long your favor lives.

   20, 21. Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation
   shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress
   them. And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall
   proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and
   he shall approach unto Me: for who is this that engaged his heart to
   approach unto Me?says the LORD. There is One, whom we call Master and
   Lord, who approaches the Throne of God on our behalf--One who fulfils
   that ancient Word of God, "I have exalted One chosen out of the
   people." Our glorious Savior, through His humanity, is one of us and He
   appears before God on our behalf, blessed be His holy name!

   22. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God. Happy are we if
   we can rejoice in this precious Truth of

   God!

Decided Ungodliness

   (No. 2655)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1899.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 20, 1882.

   They have refused to return."

   Jeremiah 5:3.

   THERE is, in the heart of every one of us, the primary evil of sin. We
   have all transgressed against the Lord. So far, so bad, but that
   natural sin of ours may be greatly increased by a refusal to turn from
   it. It is bad enough to have violated God's righteous Law, but to
   refuse to repent and to continue presumptuously in our iniquity must
   greatly increase our guilt in the sight of God. This guilt may be still
   further increased if we refuse to return unto the Lord when we are
   earnestly and affectionately invited to yield submission to Him. If
   gracious terms of peace are presented to us and matchless promises of
   blessing are made to us on condition that we return--and if we are
   often warned, often entreated, often threatened and yet we still refuse
   to return, then we continue to pile sin upon sin, till we make our
   first transgression to be incredibly great.

   If I were now to preach to men as simply sinners, it would be a weighty
   message for me to have to tell them that "all have sinned and come
   short of the glory of God." But, alas, I have to preach to impenitent
   sinners, to those who, as our text puts it, "have refused to return,"
   yes, and to some who have given that refusal with great deliberation,
   after having been long entreated and persuaded to turn from the error
   of their ways. Some have been addressed in such tender, pleading
   language as this, "Turn you, turn you from your evil ways, for why will
   you die, O house of Israel?" Or this--"Seek you the Lord while He may
   be found, call you upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake
   his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto
   the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will
   abundantly pardon." If we have heard such language as that and yet have
   persisted in refusing to return, we have heaped guilt upon guilt--and
   the wrath of God will be in proportion to our sin!

   I. My first objective, at this time, is to try to find out who are the
   persons to whom our text refers. And, to do so, I ask this question,
   WHO HAVE REFUSED TO RETURN? Perhaps I am addressing some persons who
   say, "You speak of those who have refused to return, who are they? We
   have done no such thing." Listen and let conscience be at work while I
   am answering the question.

   First, there are some who have refused to return and who have said as
   much. Perhaps not many of you, who are in this House of Prayer, have
   gone as far as that, but certainly many people in the great world have
   actually declared that they will not yield to God. Pharaoh said, "Who
   is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice?" And there are many who talk
   in the same fashion today. You may cry to them, "Turn you, turn you,
   for why will you die?" But they will not turn, they would rather die.
   They will sooner burn than turn! They will rather perish in their
   iniquities than be pardoned after repenting of their sins! And some
   even accompany their refusal with many a jest and gibe--they sneer at
   the majesty of Divine Mercy and ridicule that which is their only hope
   of safety! Concerning sinners of this type, the Lord says, "They have
   refused to return."

   Others there are who have promised to return, but they have spoken
   falsely. They have uttered fair words and pretty speeches, but there
   the matter has ended. When the Lord has said, "Go work today in My
   vineyard," they have promptly answered, "Yes, we will go," but they
   have not gone. In a very emphatic sense, "they have refused to return,"
   because they have promised to do so and then have not done it. He who
   says, "I will repent," and then does not turn from his evil ways, is
   certainly no better than the man who said that he would not repent! As
   a matter of fact, he is even worse, for there is an honesty of
   outspokenness about the other man who says, "I will not," while there
   is the falseness of gross hypocrisy in the one who says, "I go, Sir,"
   but who does not go. I fear I have a large number of this order of
   persons in my congregation--they have never flatly refused the Gospel
   invitation, as some have openly done, yet they have practically refused
   it.

   There is many a man who has said to the preacher, by his actions if not
   in words, what Felix said to Paul, "Go your way for this time. When I
   have a convenient season, I will call for you." But the convenient
   season has not yet arrived and, in all probability it never will, for
   they have no more idea of receiving the Gospel message today then they
   had 10 years ago! With all their friendly appearance and flattering
   words, they must be put down among those who "have refused to return."
   I am sure that when I say this, I do but speak the words of truth and
   justice.

   There are some others who "have refused to return" and who have tried
   to palliate their offense, and quiet their conscience by offering
   something else to God instead of really returning to Him. They will not
   turn from sin, but they will "take the sacrament," as they call the
   ordinance of the Lord's Supper. They will not leave their lusts, but
   they will go to a place of worship. They will not cease from their
   wicked ways, but they will go on giving to various charities. They will
   not leave off lying, or committing other offenses against God, but they
   will assume a pious appearance, they will sing a hymn, they will spend
   half an hour in reading the Scriptures and a form of prayer, though
   such an occupation is a great burden to them--but all that is utterly
   useless! The Lord has said that He will have mercy--not sacrifice. He
   desires us to turn from our wicked ways and to return to Him. And if we
   will not, any sacrifices that we may bring to Him will be but vain
   oblations and God will put them away from Him as things that are
   abhorred and detestable in His sight.

   Solomon tells us of three things that are an abomination unto the Lord,
   "the sacrifice of the wicked," "the way of the wicked" and even "the
   thoughtsof the wicked." We may do, or say, or give anything we like,
   but nothing will please God except our turning from our sin and
   trusting in the atoning Sacrifice of His dear Son. We may pray till our
   knees grow hard as iron and weep our eyes away till their sockets are
   empty, but we shall never obtain the great blessing of salvation while
   we link our arm with sin and go on delighting in iniquity! Alas, the
   Lord still has to say of many who make some sort of profession of being
   religious, "they have refused to return." They are willing to do almost
   anything except that. They will repeat the creed, be confirmed, "take
   the sacrament," go to chapel, go to church, go anywhere you like, but
   they will not leave their sin--they will not turn from their evil ways!
   They will be content to put upon themselves all manner of external
   religiousness, but they will not be cleansed from their iniquity.

   There are others who, practically, "have refused to return" because
   they have only returned in part. They have given up some forms of sin,
   but their heart is not right in the sight of God. Yet a man cannot
   truly turn in part--he must turn altogether, or not at all. If I am
   walking along a certain road, I cannot send one of my legs backward and
   the other one forward and, in like manner, I cannot send half my soul
   in one direction and the other half another way, though a great many
   try to do so! They will give up the grosser sins to which they have
   been accustomed, but the smaller sins, the more respectable sort of
   sins, these they will keep on committing. Yet God is not pleased by
   their changing the form of their guilt. You say that you do not worship
   Baal but, if you bow down to Ashtaroth, or any other false god, you are
   an idolater! And if there is any sin to which you cling, you are a
   sinner in God's sight!

   You read, sometimes, a dreadful story of a man being entangled in
   machinery. Perhaps it was only one cog of a wheel that caught a corner
   of his coat, but it gradually drew him in between the works and tore
   him, limb from limb, till he was utterly destroyed. Oh, if that piece
   of cloth could have but given way so that man's life might have been
   spared! But it did not and though he was only held by the tiniest part
   of his garment, yet that was sufficient to drag him in where the
   death-dealing wheels revolved. And it is just so with sin--you cannot
   get in between the wheels of iniquity and say, "I shall go just so far,
   but no farther." No, if you once get in there, you will be ground to
   pieces as certainly as you are now alive! There is no way of escape but
   to turn yourself right away from the evil thing that God hates. There
   must be no union between our heart and that which God abhors! We must
   have a clean bill of divorcement separating us, once and for all, from
   the love of sin!

   "Well," says one, "I have given up strong drink. I am no longer a
   drunkard." That is well, but you may go to Hell as a sober man. "I have
   given up Sabbath-breaking," says another. I am very glad to hear it, my
   Friend, but you may perish by dishonesty. "Oh, but I am no thief! I am
   as honest as the day!" Yes, that may be true, and yet you may perish
   through pride. "But I am not proud," you say. But you may go to
   Perdition through your lust, or even through your
   self-righteousness--any one sinharbored and indulged in by the soul
   will be the means of your everlasting ruin! Any single poison may
   suffice to kill a man--he need not take 50 different drugs--one will be
   enough to destroy him. So, if there is but one sin that is loved, that
   one sin will be as deadly poison to the soul! And as long as you cling
   to even one sin, I lay this charge at your door, that you "have refused
   to return." God grant that you may not continue any longer in this
   fatal folly and guilt!

   I will only mention one more class of those who "have refused to
   return." It is those who return to God only in appearance, yet not in
   heart. What a very long way a man may go towards being a Christian and
   yet miss the mark! He may give up all outward sin, such as his fellow
   men condemn, and yet he may be lost. Very solemnly would I say to you,
   my Friend, that you may even be a professed disciple of Christ, but so
   was Judas. You may preach--so did Judas. You may work miracles--so did
   Judas. And you may stay with Christ under much opposition and
   persecution--so did Judas. It was only at a certain point, when the
   glitter of the pieces of silver was too much for him, that he at last
   betrayed his Lord and Master. Many covetous persons are the most
   respectable people we know--yet covetousness is idolatry. They are not
   likely to give way to sinful lusts--that form of iniquity is too
   expensive for them. They are too stingy to spend anything on
   themselves. They are not, generally, the men who drink to excess and
   waste their substance in riotous living. Oh, no-- they are in the shop
   from early morning till late at night. Look how they work in their
   shirtsleeves, doing all they can to make money and, perhaps, doing it
   all honestly. But, still, covetousness is the master-thought with them,
   and to be rich is the end and aim of their whole life! That is the one
   thing for which they are striving. If it is covetousness that remains
   in the soul, there may be great outward reformations even through that
   very covetousness, for one sin will often sweep away another. There are
   very many sins that are like sharks that swallow up other devouring
   monsters. A man may devote himself to some one evil in such a way that
   he denies himself all the rest--and yet that one will bore such a hole
   in the vessel of his life that the water will get in and sink it just
   as surely as if there had been a thousand augers doing their desperate
   work.

   So, you see, dear Friends, that there are many, many persons who "have
   refused to return" to God. And in telling you about them, I have
   answered my first question.

   ' II. Here is a second one. WHAT DOES THIS REFUSAL TO RETURN TO GOD
   UNVEIL?

   Well, I think that it shows, first, that there is, in the heart of such
   a person, an intense love of sin. The man not only sins, but he loves
   to sin and, therefore, he will not return to the Lord. The paths of sin
   are pleasant to him so, if you cry to him, "Return, return, return," he
   heeds you not because he loves both the way and the wages of iniquity.

   This refusal to return also unveils a great lack of love to God. The
   prodigal son did, at last, return home because, with all his failings
   and wickedness, he remembered his father and his father's house--and
   there was some sort of love still lingering in his heart, so he said,
   "I will arise and go to my father." But many have no such love in their
   souls and, consequently, the word, "Return," has no power over them.
   They love their sin, but they love not God, so "they have refused to
   return."

   In many people, there can be no doubt whatever that this refusal to
   return unveils a disbelief in God--perhaps not a disbelief in the
   existence of God so much as a denial of the evil of sin. These refusers
   of God's mercy say to themselves, "Sin is not half as bad as God makes
   it out to be, and it will not bring such consequences as He threatens."
   When we read to them what the Apostle says about those who "obey not
   the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with
   everlasting destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the
   glory of His power," they do not believe that such a sentence as that
   will ever be executed upon them, so they harden their faces like flints
   and go on in their sin--and absolutely refuse to return unto the Lord.
   Even when He tells them that unless they turn to Him, He will shut them
   out of Heaven, they seem to fancy that it does not matter much. Heaven
   is no very wonderful and desirable place, after all, so they dream and
   again they harden their hearts and continue in their evil ways. There
   is, in the heart of every unconverted man, a real atheism--he would be
   ashamed to be called an atheist, yet he acts like one, and he is one
   practically. He may not be such a fool as to say with his mouth, "There
   is no God," but in his hearthe is all the while saying, "No God for me!
   I wish there were none. I would gladly escape from the belief even in
   His existence."

   But, oh, this is a dreadful thing, for a man to love sin and not to
   love God--and not even believe that God speaks the truth! Yet there is
   a worse evil. This refusal to return is really a despising of God.It is
   as if a man said, "I will not submit to Him! I defy Him to do His
   worst! Let Him smite me if He can. I am not afraid of His Hell and I do
   not need His Heaven. I would sooner have the pleasures of sin for a
   season than dwell with God and behold the glory of Christ to all
   eternity." Perhaps you think that I am putting the matter too strongly,
   but I am not. I am only speaking the truth and I wish to speak it in
   love to the souls of those of you who are refusing to return unto the
   Lord. You have not that reverence and fear of God which He deserves
   from you, otherwise you would turn at His reproof and He would pour out
   His Spirit upon you.

   Yet once more, I am afraid that this refusal to return shows that there
   is, in your heart, a secret resolve to continue in sin. If you "have
   refused to return," and done so for years, I fear that you are fixed in
   your evil course and that your mind is made up to remain as you are. I
   would to God that you would think a little of what the end of such a
   life must be! As you read of the eternal doom of others, you may hear
   the Lord saying to you, "Unless you repent, you shall all likewise
   perish." There is no way of salvation for a man who perseveres in the
   way of evil. Then, "Turn you, turn you, from your evil ways," for only
   by turning from sin, and unto God, can you find salvation! Yet, alas,
   many have resolved not to turn unto the Lord.

   There are some who regard their refusal to return as a trifling matter.
   They trifle with everything. Heaven and Hell seem to them to be of no
   more worth than a boy's tennis racket and balls--their soul appears to
   be, at least in their estimation--the merest trifle. I verily believe
   that some people think more of their fingernails than they do of their
   souls, and there is many a man who spends more on the blacking of his
   boots than he does on the cleansing of his soul from sin. Thus are
   these all-important things despised by those who "have refused to
   return." They make mirth about those matters which have been upon God's
   heart from all eternity and, whereas He has given His well-beloved Son
   to be the Savior of sinners, many sinners act as if salvation were not
   worth the having, or as if it were merely a thing to be talked about
   for a while and then to be forgotten forever. O Sirs, surely, these are
   the mischiefs of the heart which the refusal to return manifestly sets
   before you!

   III. I must not say more upon this point, for I want to answer a third
   question. WHAT IS IT THAT DEEPENS THE SIN OF REFUSING TO RETURN?

   Well, first, it is when correction does not lead to repentance. Let me
   read the sentences that precede our text--"You have stricken them, but
   they have not grieved; You have consumed them, but they have refused to
   receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they
   have refused to return." This passage may be applied to any of you who
   have been very ill and made promises of repentance, all of which you
   have forgotten. It may also be pressed home upon the consciences of
   some of you who, perhaps through your own fault, have been thrown out
   of a situation and cast adrift in the world. You have been corrected by
   poverty and, possibly, you have also been stricken by affliction, but
   all that has not touched your heart--you "have refused to return." I
   have known some who have lost child after child, and friend after
   friend. Those bereavements have been God's method of correcting them,
   so as to bring them to their senses, yet they have not turned to Him.
   No, they have even grown all the harder the more they have been
   chastened! They have stood out, like Pharaoh, against God's sternest
   plagues, and still have said, "Who is Jehovah that we should obey His
   voice?" If they have not said so in words, they have said it in their
   acts, which have spoken louder than words.

   This refusal to return also leads to deepening sin when conscience is
   violated. If I were to put the question to any one of you who have not
   turned to God, "Ought you not to repent of sin and trust the Savior?" I
   feel sure that your answer would be, "Of course I ought to! Do you
   think that I am so ignorant as not to know that it is right to forsake
   sin and to follow that which is good and holy?" Then, understand, if
   you know this, yet do it not, your doom will be terrible, according to
   our Lord's words, "That servant which knew his lord's will and prepared
   not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with
   many stripes." It is an awful thing, a dreadful thing, to know what you
   ought to do--to feel that it is right that you should do it--and yet
   remain stubborn and disobedient!

   All this adds greatly to a man's guilt in refusing to return unto the
   Lord. And so it does when he knows that it would be the best thing for
   him. I have often heard a man say, "Oh, yes, Sir, I know that if I
   repented of sin, if I believed in Jesus, if I became right with God, I
   should be much happier than I am now. Indeed, I cannot rest as I am, I
   need to find something better." Then why do you not find it? You cannot
   have peace with God all the while that you keep your sin-- then why do
   you not give them up? Why not turn unto the Lord with full purpose of
   heart? When you know that it would be for your present and eternal
   good. When you know that you would be happier and holier, and yet you
   continue as you are, who shall be found to plead for you? Where is the
   advocate, in Heaven or on earth, who will take up the cause of a man
   who knows the right and yet will not do it--who is well aware that
   turning to God will save him--and yet acts in direct opposition to his
   own highest interests? It seems incredible that anyone should be so
   foolish, yet multitudes are!

   It greatly adds to a man's sin, also, if this refusal to return to the
   Lord has been long continued, and I am afraid, in the case of some
   here--and, oh, how tenderly would I grasp their hands if I could, and
   ask them whether it is not so-- that this refusal has gone on for many
   years! Is it not so, my dear Friend? You had a tender conscience in
   your childhood and you have not quite lost it. You have often been
   moved to tears under earnest, faithful preaching and, tonight, you
   hardly know how to sit still. You are ready to cry out to me, "Leave
   off urging me thus, for I cannot bear it!" And do you expect that God
   will spare you for another 10 years, or another 20 years? You cannot
   tell that He will. You have no right to think that He will and, if He
   does, will you fling the sins of those additional years on to the heap
   of your past and present iniquities? Will you make the millstone of
   your guilt bigger and yet bigger until, at last, it sinks you into the
   lowest Hell?

   Take heed, I pray you! It is a great blessing to turn to God in youth,
   for early piety often becomes eminent piety-- but it is terrible to be
   living year after year without God, without Christ and without hope in
   the world. Turn unto the Lord speedily, I pray you! Let the time past
   suffice for you to have refused the mercy of your God and now, this
   very hour, I charge you, before you dare to go from under this roof,
   turn unto your God and seek and find pardon and salvation through the
   atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son!

   There is one other thing which sometimes makes this refusal to return
   to God become even greater sin, and that is, when there is some evil
   reason at the bottom of it. I cannot pry into the hearts of my hearers,
   but I did know a man, once, and he was very fair to look upon--and I
   often wondered why he did not become a decided Christian. He was
   respected by all who knew him until they found out his awful secret--he
   had another family in addition to his own family at home. How could he
   turn unto God when he was living in sin? I have known others who seemed
   to be sure of salvation, but they were drinking in private--I mean
   women as well as men--how could they turn to God when they were
   secretly indulging in excess? Perhaps it is a very mean and
   contemptible thing that is keeping you from the Savior. You would turn
   to God, but you have an old friend who would laugh at you if you became
   a Christian. Possibly, it is your own father who would despise you, or,
   perhaps, dear wife, it is your husband who would oppress you if you
   gave yourself up to the Lord. But shall any of these be allowed to ruin
   your souls?

   They may laugh you into Hell, but they cannot laugh you out again! Men
   may put cruel pressure upon you till your fear of them drives you away
   from God, but it would be well if your fear of them could be slain by a
   greater fear, for it is infinitely better to dread the wrath of God
   than to fear the anger of man! For what can man do, after all, even if
   he should kill the body? Remember the words of our Lord Jesus upon this
   matter, "I say unto you My friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
   body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn
   you whom you shall fear: Fear Him, which after He has killed, has power
   to cast into Hell; yes, I say unto you, Fear Him." Be not such cowards
   as to be lost forever through indulging your cowardice. Pluck up
   courage enough to seek your own salvation, for "what shall a man give
   in exchange for his soul?" Oh, flee, flee from the wrath to come!
   Whatever the ribald crowd may say, what will it matter to you in the
   tremendous day when you stand before the Great White Throne? How can
   you, then, escape from the wrath of the Lamb if you do not fly to Him
   now that you are exposed to the wrath of ungodly men?

   IV. Now I must close with my last question. WHAT IS THE REAL REASON OF
   THIS REFUSAL TO RETURN?

   Well, first, it may be ignorance. I hope it is, for then Christ can
   pray, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Notice
   how the Prophet put it--"Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they
   are foolish: for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of
   their God." He hoped that it was downright ignorance that kept some of
   them from yielding their hearts to God, but he said that he would go
   and try the rich ones--"I will get me unto the great men, and will
   speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the
   judgment of their God." But he fared no better there! "These have
   altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds." It is still very much
   the same--rich and poor alike refuse to return unto the Lord their God.

   Then, next, while there are some who are kept away from Christ through
   ignorance, there are many others who fail to come to Him through
   self-conceit. Perhaps--though it is but a choice of evils--it is better
   not to know the way of salvation than to know it, and yet not to walk
   in it. Some poor soul says, "I cannot come to Christ, for I do not know
   the way." HE is the way! Trust Him and you have already come to Him!
   But some great man says, "I do not want to go to Christ. I am good
   enough, I have always been religious." Ah, poor deluded creature! You
   are defying God by setting up your own righteousness in the place of
   Christ's righteousness--and so your "sacraments" and your hearing of
   sermons, and your few miserable good works are to stand instead of
   yonder amazing Sacrifice upon the Cross where there hangs the Son of
   God in agonies and blood? You set up your filthy rags to compete with
   the spotless robe of His matchless righteousness? This is an atrocity
   which, even if you had committed no other sin, would sink you to the
   lowest Hell!

   But, to tell you the real reason of this refusal to return, I must say
   that men do not turn to Christ because they do not want to be made
   holy. An eminent man of God said, "To some sinners, the Gospel comes as
   a threat from God that it will make them holy." Is it not a dreadful
   thing, that men should actually turn what is the greatest of all
   blessings--the being made holy--into a thing of which they are afraid?
   They do not want to be true! They do not want to be good! They do not
   want to be right in God's sight! They prefer their own ways, they
   choose to follow their own devices. That is the top and bottom of the
   mischief! Now I have laid my finger upon the very core of the evil. If
   you willed to be saved, you would be saved--if you really desired to be
   made holy, you would be made holy! It is because your heart's longings
   still go after that which is evil that, therefore, you do not turn unto
   the Lord! O mighty Spirit of God, change the very nature of men and
   bring them to desire the holiness which they now despise, for then will
   You work it in them and they shall be saved!

   The fact is and this is the last reason for refusing to return, there
   is, in most men, a preference for present joy above future blessing.
   "Heaven" they say--"well, Heaven--Heaven--we do not know where it is.
   It is a long way off and we cannot tell when we shall get there. But
   here is an opportunity of spending an evening in pleasurable sin and we
   prefer that! 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'" O foolish
   men! Your poor little bird in the hand is not worth one of the birds in
   the Paradise of God!

   Others cry, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." What? Are you
   no better than the brute beasts that per-ish--the cattle in the pasture
   fattening for the slaughter? What? Has God given us immortal souls and
   yet are we never to look beyond the present life? Has He adapted us to
   live with Him at His right hand and yet is the dim horizon of this
   little life to shut in all that we care to know? Is it so that when you
   are in your coffin, you will have had your all? "I have no fear," says
   one. But have you any hope, Sir? That is the point, for many a man has
   so drugged his soul with the opiate of self-deception that fear, which
   was meant to be like a watchman, has been lulled into deadly slumber!
   So listen again--Have you any hope? "No," you answer. Then you are in a
   desperate condition, but why are you without hope? Because you are
   without God! I would not change places with you even to get rid of all
   fear as you have done, for I have a good hope that, through Divine
   Grace, though my spirit must be parted for a while from this flesh, yet
   it will never be divided from Christ, my Lord, and it shall be my
   delight to be--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin With God eternally shut in."

   God bless you, dear Friend! Believe in Jesus and you live at once!
   Believe in Him this moment and this moment you are saved! Trust Christ
   now, as soon as this word reaches your ears, and your sin is forgiven,
   you are justified and accepted and you may go your way, a sinner
   saved--saved to all eternity! God give you that blessed privilege, for
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS2.

   Verse 1. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
   which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. I t is
   well to give heed to what you are now hearing, but it is also important
   to give heed to what you have heard. Oh, how much have we heard, but
   have forgotten! How much have we heard which we still remember, but do
   not practice! Let us, therefore, listen to the words of the Apostle
   here--"We ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we
   have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip"--as it were,
   slipping through our fingers and flowing down the stream of time to be
   carried away into the ocean of oblivion!

   2. For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every
   transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward.
   See, Brothers and Sisters, the punishment for disobeying the word
   spoken by angels was death. What, then, must be the penalty of
   neglecting the great salvation worked by the Divine Redeemer, Himself?
   He who does not give earnest heed to the Gospel treats with disdain the
   Lord Jesus Christ and he will have to answer for that sin when the King
   shall sit upon the Throne of Judgment. Trifle not, therefore, with that
   salvation which cost Christ so much and which He, Himself, brings to
   you with bleeding hands. And, oh, if you have hitherto trifled with it,
   and let it slip, may you now be brought to a better mind, lest haply,
   despising Christ, the "just recompense of reward" should come upon you!
   And what will that be? I know of no punishment that can be too severe
   for the man who treats with contempt the Son of God and tramples on His
   blood--and every individual who hears the Gospel and yet does not
   receive Christ as his Savior--is committing that atrocious crime.

   3. How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? If we
   neglect that salvation, is there any other way by which we can be
   rescued from destruction? Is there any other door of escape if we pass
   that one by? No, there is none.

   3, 4. Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them
   witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
   gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?This Gospel of ours
   is stamped with the seal of God! He has set His mark upon it to attest
   its genuineness and authority. The miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit
   were the seal that the Gospel was no invention of man, but that it was,
   indeed, the message of God. Gifts of healing, gifts of tongues, gifts
   of miracles of divers kinds, were God's solemn declaration to man,
   "This is the Gospel. This is My Gospel which I send to you; therefore,
   refuse it not."

   5. For unto the angels He has not put the world to come in subjection,
   whereof we speak. We have no angelic preachers. We sometimes speak of
   "the seraphic doctor," but no seraph ever was a preacher of the Gospel
   of the Grace of God--that honor has been reserved for a lower order of
   beings!

   6. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that You
   are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him? God speaks
   to men by men. He has made them to be the choice and chosen instruments
   of His wondrous works of Grace upon earth. Oh, what a solemn thing it
   is to be a preacher of the everlasting Gospel! It is an office so high
   that an angel might covet it, but one that is so responsible that even
   an angel might tremble to undertake it! Brothers and Sisters, pray for
   us who preach, not merely to a few, but to many of our fellow
   creatures, that we may be the means, in the hand of God, of blessing to
   our hearers!

   7. 8. You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with
   glory and honor, and did set him over the works of Your hands: You
   haveput all things in subjection under his feet It was so with Adam in
   his measure. Before he fell through his disobedience, all the animals
   which God had made were inferior to him and acknowledged him as their
   lord and master. It is infinitely more so in that second Adam who has
   restored to humanity its lost dignity and, in His own Person, has again
   elevated man to the head of creation--"You have put all things in
   subjection under his feet."

   8. For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that
   is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
   Man does not yet rule the world. Wild beasts defy him. Storms vanquish
   him. There are a thousand things not at present submissive to his
   control.

   9. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
   the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that He, by the
   Grace of God, should taste death for every man. Thus lifting man back
   into the place where he first stood so far as this matter of dominion
   is concerned.

   10. For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings. Is it not amazing that the
   Christ, who is the Head over all things, could not be perfected for
   this work of ruling, or for the work of saving, except by sufferings?
   He stooped to conquer! Not because there was any sin in Him, but that
   He might be a sympathetic Ruler over His people, He must experience
   sufferings like those of His subjects. And that He might be a mighty
   Savior, He must be, Himself, compassed with infirmity, that He might
   "have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way."
   Brothers and Sisters, do you expect to be made perfect without
   sufferings? It will never be so with you--

   "Thepath of sorrow, and that path alone,

   Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown." We shall never be fit for
   the Heavenly Canaan unless we first pass through the wilderness! There
   are certain things about us which require this, so thus it must be.

   11. For both He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of
   one. One family. One by nature with Christ our glorious Head.

   11. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren. Oh, this
   blessed condescension of Christ! We are often ashamed of ourselves.
   Alas, we are sometimes so base as to be ashamed of Him--but He is never
   ashamed to call us brethren.

   12. Saying, I will declare Your name unto My brethren, in the midst of
   the church will I sing praise unto You. Christ, the center of the
   celestial choirs, is also the center of all the bands of true singers
   that are yet here below.

   13. And again, I willput my trust in Him. This is our Lord Jesus Christ
   putting His trust in the Father, overcoming by faith, even as we do.
   Oh, what a marvelous oneness there is, here, between Christ and His
   people! Well might the Apostle say that "both He that sanctifies and
   they who are sanctified are all of one."

   13, 14. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given Me.
   Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He
   also Himself likewise took part of the same. We know what it is to be
   partakers of flesh and blood. We often wish that we did not. It is the
   flesh that drags us down. It is the flesh that brings us a thousand
   sorrows. I have a converted soul, but an unconverted body. Christ has
   healed my soul, but He has left my body, to a large extent, still in
   bondage and, therefore, it still has to suffer. But the Lord will
   redeem even that! The redemption of the body is the adoption and that
   is to come at the day of the Resurrection. But think of Christ, who was
   a partaker of the Eternal Godhead, condescending to make Himself a
   partaker of flesh and blood--the Godhead linked with materialism! The
   Infinite, an Infant! The Eternal prepared to die and actually dying!
   Oh, wondrous mystery, this union of Deity with humanity in the Person
   of Christ Jesus our Lord! Why did He become a partaker of flesh and
   blood and die upon the Cross? Listen--

   14. That through death He might destroy him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil That, through dying, He might overthrow
   Satan's power for all who trust Him!

   15-18. And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage. For verily He took not on Him the nature
   of angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham. Therefore in all
   things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might
   be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to
   make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself
   has suffered, being tempted, He is able to succor them that are
   tempted. Glory be to His holy name forever and ever! Amen.

   PRAY THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL USE THIS SERMON TO BRING MANY TO A SAVING
   KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS CHRIST.
