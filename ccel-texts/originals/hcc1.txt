   PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION

   As I appear before the public with a new edition of my Church History,
   I feel more than ever the difficulty and responsibility of a task which
   is well worthy to occupy the whole time and strength of a long life,
   and which carries in it its own rich reward. The true historian of
   Christianity is yet to come. But short as I have fallen of my own
   ideal, I have done my best, and shall rejoice if my efforts stimulate
   others to better and more enduring work.

   History should be written from the original sources of friend and foe,
   in the spirit of truth and love, "sine ira et studio," "with malice
   towards none, and charity for all," in clear, fresh, vigorous style,
   under the guidance of the twin parables of the mustard seed and leaven,
   as a book of life for instruction, correction, encouragement, as the
   best exposition and vindication of Christianity. The great and good
   Neander, "the father of Church History"--first an Israelite without
   guile hoping for the Messiah, then a Platonist longing for the
   realization of his ideal of righteousness, last a Christian in head and
   heart--made such a history his life-work, but before reaching the
   Reformation he was interrupted by sickness, and said to his faithful
   sister: "Hannchen, I am weary; let us go home; good night!" And thus he
   fell gently asleep, like a child, to awake in the land where all
   problems of history are solved.

   When, after a long interruption caused by a change of professional
   duties and literary labors, I returned to the favorite studies of my
   youth, I felt the necessity, before continuing the History to more
   recent times, of subjecting the first volume to a thorough revision, in
   order to bring it up to the present state of investigation. We live in
   a restless and stirring age of discovery, criticism, and
   reconstruction. During the thirty years which have elapsed since the
   publication of my separate "History of the Apostolic Church," there has
   been an incessant activity in this field, not only in Germany, the
   great workshop of critical research, but in all other Protestant
   countries. Almost every inch of ground has been disputed and defended
   with a degree of learning, acumen, and skill such as were never spent
   before on the solution of historical problems.

   In this process of reconstruction the first volume has been more than
   doubled in size and grown into two volumes. The first embraces
   Apostolic, the second post-Apostolic or ante-Nicene Christianity. The
   first volume is larger than my separate "History of the Apostolic
   Church," but differs from it in that it is chiefly devoted to the
   theology and literature, the other to the mission work and spiritual
   life of that period. I have studiously avoided repetition and seldom
   looked into the older book. On two points I have changed my
   opinion--the second Roman captivity of Paul (which I am disposed to
   admit in the interest of the Pastoral Epistles), and the date of the
   Apocalypse (which I now assign, with the majority of modern critics, to
   the year 68 or 69 instead of 95, as before). [2]

   I express my deep obligation to my friend, Dr. Ezra Abbot, a scholar of
   rare learning and microscopic accuracy, for his kind and valuable
   assistance in reading the proof and suggesting improvements.

   The second volume, likewise thoroughly revised and partly rewritten, is
   in the hands of the printer; the third requires a few changes. Two new
   volumes, one on the History of Mediaeval Christianity, and one on the
   Reformation (to the Westphalian Treaty and the Westminster Assembly,
   1648), are in an advanced stage of preparation.

   May the work in this remodelled shape find as kind and indulgent
   readers as when it first appeared. My highest ambition in this
   sceptical age is to strengthen the immovable historical foundations of
   Christianity and its victory over the world.

   [2] My "History of the Apostolic Church" (which bears a relation to my
   "History of the Christian Church," similar to that which Neander's
   "History of the Planting and Training of the Christian Church by the
   Apostles" bears to his "General History of the Christian Religion and
   Church") appeared in German at Mercersburg, Pa., 1851, then in a
   revised edition, Leipzig, 1854, in an English translation by the late
   Dr. Yeomans, New York, 1853, at Edinburg, 1854 (in 2 vols.), and
   several times since without change. Should there be a demand for a new
   edition, I intend to make a number of improvements, which are ready in
   manuscript, especially in the General Introduction, which covers 134
   pages. The first volume of my Church History (from A. D. 1 to 311) was
   first published in New York, 1858, (and in German at Leipzig, 1867);
   but when I began the revision, I withdrew it from sale. The Apostolic
   age there occupies only 140, the whole volume 535 pages.

   FROM THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

   ----------------------

   Encouraged by the favorable reception of my "History of the Apostolic
   Church," I now offer to the public a History of the Primitive Church
   from the birth of Christ to the reign of Constantine, as an independent
   and complete work in itself, and at the same time as the first volume
   of a general history of Christianity, which I hope, with the help of
   God, to bring down to the present age.

   The church of the first three centuries, or the ante-Nicene age,
   possesses a peculiar interest for Christians of all denominations, and
   has often been separately treated, by Eusebius, Mosheim, Milman, Kaye,
   Baur, Hagenbach, and other distinguished historians. It is the daughter
   of Apostolic Christianity, which itself constitutes the first and by
   far the most important chapter in its history, and the common mother of
   Catholicism and Protestantism, though materially differing from both.
   It presents a state of primitive simplicity and purity unsullied by
   contact with the secular power, but with this also, the fundamental
   forms of heresy and corruption, which reappear from time to time under
   new names and aspects, but must serve, in the overruling providence of
   God, to promote the cause of truth and righteousness. It is the heroic
   age of the church, and unfolds before us the sublime spectacle of our
   holy religion in intellectual and moral conflict with the combined
   superstition, policy, and wisdom of ancient Judaism and Paganism; yet
   growing in persecution, conquering in death, and amidst the severest
   trials giving birth to principles and institutions which, in more
   matured form, still control the greater part of Christendom.

   Without the least disposition to detract from the merits of my numerous
   predecessors, to several of whom I feel deeply indebted, I have reason
   to hope that this new attempt at a historical reproduction of ancient
   Christianity will meet a want in our theological literature and commend
   itself, both by its spirit and method, and by presenting with the
   author's own labors the results of the latest German and English
   research, to the respectful attention of the American student. Having
   no sectarian ends to serve, I have confined myself to the duty of a
   witness--to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth;
   always remembering, however, that history has a soul as well as a body,
   and that the ruling ideas and general principles must be represented no
   less than the outward facts and dates. A church history without the
   life of Christ glowing through its pages could give us at best only the
   picture of a temple stately and imposing from without, but vacant and
   dreary within, a mummy in praying posture perhaps and covered with
   trophies, but withered and unclean: such a history is not worth the
   trouble of writing or reading. Let the dead bury their dead; we prefer
   to live among the living, and to record the immortal thoughts and deeds
   of Christ in and through his people, rather than dwell upon the outer
   hulls, the trifling accidents and temporary scaffolding of history, or
   give too much prominence to Satan and his infernal tribe, whose works
   Christ came to destroy.

   The account of the apostolic period, which forms the divine-human basis
   of the whole structure of history, or the ever-living fountain of the
   unbroken stream of the church, is here necessarily short and not
   intended to supersede my larger work, although it presents more than a
   mere summary of it, and views the subject in part under new aspects.
   For the history of the second period, which constitutes the body of
   this volume, large use has been made of the new sources of information
   recently brought to light, such as the Syriac and Armenian Ignatius,
   and especially the Philosophoumena of Hippolytus. The bold and
   searching criticism of modern German historians as applied to the
   apostolic and post-apostolic literature, though often arbitrary and
   untenable in its results, has nevertheless done good service by
   removing old prejudices, placing many things in a new light, and
   conducing to a comprehensive and organic view of the living process and
   gradual growth of ancient Christianity in its distinctive character,
   both in its unity with, and difference from, the preceding age of the
   apostles and the succeeding systems of Catholicism and Protestantism.

   And now I commit this work to the great Head of the church with the
   prayer that, under his blessing, it may aid in promoting a correct
   knowledge of his heavenly kingdom on earth, and in setting forth its
   history as a book if life, a storehouse of wisdom and piety, and surest
   test of his own promise to his people: "Lo, I am with you alway, even
   unto the end of the world."

   PREFACE TO THIRD REVISION

   ----------------------

   The continued demand for my Church History lays upon me the grateful
   duty of keeping it abreast of the times. I have, therefore, submitted
   this and the other volumes (especially the second) to another revision
   and brought the literature down to the latest date, as the reader will
   see by glancing at pages 2, 35, 45, 51-53, 193, 411, 484, 569, 570,
   etc. The changes have been effected by omissions and condensations,
   without enlarging the size. The second volume is now passing through
   the fifth edition, and the other volumes will follow rapidly.

   This is my last revision. If any further improvements should be
   necessary during my lifetime, I shall add them in a separate appendix.

   I feel under great obligation to the reading public which enables me to
   perfect my work. The interest in Church History is steadily increasing
   in our theological schools and among the rising generation of scholars,
   and promises good results for the advancement of our common
   Christianity.

   W. H. Ramsey (Professor of Humanity in the University of Aberdeen): The
   Church in the Roman Empire before a.d. 170. With Maps and
   Illustrations. London and New York, 1893 (494 pp.). An important work,
   for which the author received a gold medal from Pope Leo XIII. The
   first part (pp. 3-168) treats of the missionary journeys of Paul in
   Asia Minor, on the ground of careful topographical exploration and with
   a full knowledge of Roman history at that time. He comes to the
   conclusion that nearly all the books of the New Testament can no more
   be forgeries of the second century than the works of Horace and Virgil
   can be forgeries of the time of Nero. He assumes all "travel-document,"
   which was written down under the immediate influence of Paul, and
   underlies the account in The Acts of the Apostles (Acts. 13-21), which
   he calls "an authority of the highest character for an historian of
   Asia Minor" (p. 168). He affirms the genuineness of the Pastoral
   Epistles, which suit the close of the Neronian period (246 sqq.), and
   combats Holtzmann. He puts 2 Peter to the age of "The Shepherd of
   Hermas" before 130 (p. 432). As to the First Epistle of Peter, he
   assumes that it was written about 80, soon after Vespasian's resumption
   of the Neronian policy (279 sqq.). If this date is correct, it would
   follow either that Peter cannot have been the author, or that he must
   have long outlived the Neronian persecution. The tradition that he died
   a martyr in Rome is early and universal, but the exact date of his
   death is uncertain.

   Page 285 insert:

   Of Weizsaecker's Das Apostolische Zeitalter, which is chiefly devoted
   to Paul, a second edition has appeared in 1892, slightly revised and
   provided with an alphabetical index (770 pp.). It is the best critical
   history of the Apostolic age from the school of Dr. Baur, whom Dr.
   Weizsaecker succeeded as professor of Church history in Tuebingen, but
   gives no references to literature and other opinions.

   § 1. Nature of Church History.

   History has two sides, a divine and a human. On the part of God, it is
   his revelation in the order of time (as the creation is his revelation
   in the order of space), and the successive unfolding of a plan of
   infinite wisdom, justice, and mercy, looking to his glory and the
   eternal happiness of mankind. On the part of man, history is the
   biography of the human race, and the gradual development, both normal
   and abnormal, of all its physical, intellectual, and moral forces to
   the final consummation at the general judgment, with its eternal
   rewards and punishments. The idea of universal history presupposes the
   Christian idea of the unity of God, and the unity and common destiny of
   men, and was unknown to ancient Greece and Rome. A view of history
   which overlooks or undervalues the divine factor starts from deism and
   consistently runs into atheism; while the opposite view, which
   overlooks the free agency of man and his moral responsibility and
   guilt, is essentially fatalistic and pantheistic.

   From the human agency we may distinguish the Satanic, which enters as a
   third power into the history of the race. In the temptation of Adam in
   Paradise, the temptation of Christ in the wilderness, and at every
   great epoch, Satan appears as the antagonist of God, endeavoring to
   defeat the plan of redemption and the progress of Christ's kingdom, and
   using weak and wicked men for his schemes, but is always defeated in
   the end by the superior wisdom of God.

   The central current and ultimate aim of universal history is the
   Kingdom of God established by Jesus Christ. This is the grandest and
   most comprehensive institution in the world, as vast as humanity and as
   enduring as eternity. All other institutions are made subservient to
   it, and in its interest the whole world is governed. It is no
   after-thought of God, no subsequent emendation of the plan of creation,
   but it is the eternal forethought, the controlling idea, the beginning,
   the middle, and the end of all his ways and works. The first Adam is a
   type of the second Adam; creation looks to redemption as the solution
   of its problems. Secular history, far from controlling sacred history,
   is controlled by it, must directly or indirectly subserve its ends, and
   can only be fully understood in the central light of Christian truth
   and the plan of salvation. The Father, who directs the history of the
   world, "draws to the Son," who rules the history of the church, and the
   Son leads back to the Father, that "God may be all in all." "All
   things," says St. Paul, "were created through Christ and unto Christ:
   and He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. And
   He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the
   firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the
   pre-eminence." Col. 1:16-18. "The Gospel," says John von Müller,
   summing up the final result of his lifelong studies in history, "is the
   fulfilment of all hopes, the perfection of all philosophy, the
   interpreter of all revolutions, the key of all seeming contradictions
   of the physical and moral worlds; it is life--it is immortality."

   The history of the church is the rise and progress of the kingdom of
   heaven upon earth, for the glory of God and the salvation of the world.
   It begins with the creation of Adam, and with that promise of the
   serpent-bruiser, which relieved the loss of the paradise of innocence
   by the hope of future redemption from the curse of sin. It comes down
   through the preparatory revelations under the patriarchs, Moses, and
   the prophets, to the immediate forerunner of the Saviour, who pointed
   his followers to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
   world. But this part of its course was only introduction. Its proper
   starting-point is the incarnation of the Eternal Word, who dwelt among
   us and revealed his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
   Father, full of grace and truth; and next to this, the miracle of the
   first Pentecost, when the Church took her place as a Christian
   institution, filled with the Spirit of the glorified Redeemer and
   entrusted with the conversion of all nations. Jesus Christ, the God-Man
   and Saviour of the world, is the author of the new creation, the soul
   and the head of the church, which is his body and his bride. In his
   person and work lies all the fulness of the Godhead and of renewed
   humanity, the whole plan of redemption, and the key of all history from
   the creation of man in the image of God to the resurrection of the body
   unto everlasting life.

   This is the objective conception of church history.

   In the subjective sense of the word, considered as theological science
   and art, church history is the faithful and life-like description of
   the origin and progress of this heavenly kingdom. It aims to reproduce
   in thought and to embody in language its outward and inward development
   down to the present time. It is a continuous commentary on the Lord's
   twin parables of the mustard-seed and of the leaven. It shows at once
   how Christianity spreads over the world, and how it penetrates,
   transforms, and sanctifies the individual and all the departments and
   institutions of social life. It thus embraces not only the external
   fortunes of Christendom, but more especially her inward experience, her
   religious life, her mental and moral activity, her conflicts with the
   ungodly world, her sorrows and sufferings, her joys and her triumphs
   over sin and error. It records the deeds of those heroes of faith "who
   subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the
   mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the
   sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned
   to flight the armies of aliens."

   From Jesus Christ, since his manifestation in the flesh, an unbroken
   stream of divine light and life has been and is still flowing, and will
   continue to flow, in ever-growing volume through the waste of our
   fallen race; and all that is truly great and good and holy in the
   annals of church history is due, ultimately, to the impulse of his
   spirit. He is the fly-wheel in the world's progress. But he works upon
   the world through sinful and fallible men, who, while as self-conscious
   and free agents they are accountable for all their actions, must still,
   willing or unwilling, serve the great purpose of God. As Christ, in the
   days of his flesh, was bated, mocked, and crucified, his church
   likewise is assailed and persecuted by the powers of darkness. The
   history of Christianity includes therefore a history of Antichrist.
   With an unending succession of works of saving power and manifestations
   of divine truth and holiness, it uncovers also a fearful mass of
   corruption and error. The church militant must, from its very nature,
   be at perpetual warfare with the world, the flesh, and the devil, both
   without and within. For as Judas sat among the apostles, so "the man of
   sin" sits in the temple of God; and as even a Peter denied the Lord,
   though he afterwards wept bitterly and regained his holy office, so do
   many disciples in all ages deny him in word and in deed.

   But on the other hand, church history shows that God is ever stronger
   than Satan, and that his kingdom of light puts the kingdom of darkness
   to shame. The Lion of the tribe of Judah has bruised the head of the
   serpent. With the crucifixion of Christ his resurrection also is
   repeated ever anew in the history of his church on earth; and there has
   never yet been a day without a witness of his presence and power
   ordering all things according to his holy will. For he has received all
   power in heaven and in earth for the good of his people, and from his
   heavenly throne he rules even his foes. The infallible word of promise,
   confirmed by experience, assures us that all corruptions, heresies, and
   schisms must, under the guidance of divine wisdom and love, subserve
   the cause of truth, holiness, and peace; till, at the last judgment,
   Christ shall make his enemies his footstool, and rule undisputed with
   the sceptre of righteousness and peace, and his church shall realize
   her idea and destiny as "the fullness of him that filleth all in all."

   Then will history itself, in its present form, as a struggling and
   changeful development, give place to perfection, and the stream of time
   come to rest in the ocean of eternity, but this rest will be the
   highest form of life and activity in God and for God.

   § 2. Branches of Church History.

   The kingdom of Christ, in its principle and aim, is as comprehensive as
   humanity. It is truly catholic or universal, designed and adapted for
   all nations and ages, for all the powers of the soul, and all classes
   of society. It breathes into the mind, the heart, and the will a
   higher, supernatural life, and consecrates the family, the state,
   science, literature, art, and commerce to holy ends, till finally God
   becomes all in all. Even the body, and the whole visible creation,
   which groans for redemption from its bondage to vanity and for the
   glorious liberty of the children of God, shall share in this universal
   transformation; for we look for the resurrection of the body, and for
   the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. But we must not identify
   the kingdom of God with the visible church or churches, which are only
   its temporary organs and agencies, more or less inadequate, while the
   kingdom itself is more comprehensive, and will last for ever.

   Accordingly, church history has various departments, corresponding to
   the different branches of secular history and of natural life. The
   principal divisions are:

   I. The history of missions, or of the spread of Christianity among
   unconverted nations, whether barbarous or civilized. This work must
   continue, till "the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in," and
   "Israel shall be saved." The law of the missionary progress is
   expressed in the two parables of the grain of mustard-seed which grows
   into a tree, and of the leaven which gradually pervades the whole lump.
   The first parable illustrates the outward expansion, the second the
   all-penetrating and transforming power of Christianity. It is difficult
   to convert a nation; it is more difficult to train it to the high
   standard of the gospel; it is most difficult to revive and reform a
   dead or apostate church.

   The foreign mission work has achieved three great conquests: first, the
   conversion of the elect remnant of the Jews, and of civilized Greeks
   and Romans, in the first three centuries; then the conversion of the
   barbarians of Northern and Western Europe, in the middle ages; and
   last, the combined efforts of various churches and societies for the
   conversion of the savage races in America, Africa, and Australia, and
   the semi-civilized nations of Eastern Asia, in our own time. The whole
   non-Christian world is now open to missionary labor, except the
   Mohammedan, which will likewise become accessible at no distant day.

   The domestic or home mission work embraces the revival of Christian
   life in corrupt or neglected portions of the church in old countries,
   the supply of emigrants in new countries with the means of grace, and
   the labors, among the semi-heathenism populations of large cities. Here
   we may mention the planting of a purer Christianity among the petrified
   sects in Bible Lands, the labors of the Gustavus Adolphus Society, and
   the Inner mission of Germany, the American Home Missionary Societies
   for the western states and territories, the City Mission Societies in
   London, New York, and other fast-growing cities.

   II. The history of Persecution by hostile powers; as by Judaism and
   Heathenism in the first three centuries, and by Mohammedanism in the
   middle age. This apparent repression of the church proves a purifying
   process, brings out the moral heroism of martyrdom, and thus works in
   the end for the spread and establishment of Christianity. "The blood of
   martyrs is the seed of the church." [3] There are cases, however, where
   systematic and persistent persecution has crushed out the church or
   reduced it to a mere shadow, as in Palestine, Egypt, and North Africa,
   under the despotism of the Moslems.

   Persecution, like missions, is both foreign and domestic. Besides being
   assailed from without by the followers of false religions, the church
   suffers also from intestine wars and violence. Witness the religious
   wars in France, Holland, and England, the Thirty Years' War in Germany,
   all of which grew out of the Protestant Reformation and the Papal
   Reaction; the crusade against the Albigenses and Waldenses, the horrors
   of the Spanish Inquisition, the massacre of the Huguenots, the
   dragonnades of Louis XIV., the crushing out of the Reformation in
   Bohemia, Belgium, and Southern Europe; but also, on the Protestant
   side, the persecution of Anabaptists, the burning of Servetus in Geneva
   the penal laws of the reign of Elizabeth against Catholic and Puritan
   Dissenters, the hanging of witches and Quakers in New England. More
   Christian blood has been shed by Christians than by heathens and
   Mohammedans.

   The persecutions of Christians by Christians form the satanic chapters,
   the fiendish midnight scenes, in the history of the church. But they
   show also the gradual progress of the truly Christian spirit of
   religious toleration and freedom. Persecution exhausted ends in
   toleration, and toleration is a step to freedom. The blood of patriots
   is the price of civil, the blood of martyrs the price of religious
   liberty. The conquest is dear, the progress slow and often interrupted,
   but steady and irresistible. The principle of intolerance is now almost
   universally disowned in the Christian world, except by ultramontane
   Romanism (which indirectly reasserts it in the Papal Syllabus of 1864);
   but a ruling church, allied to the state, under the influence of
   selfish human nature, and, relying on the arm of flesh rather than the
   power of truth, is always tempted to impose or retain unjust
   restrictions on dissenting sects, however innocent and useful they may
   have proved to be.

   In the United States all Christian denominations and sects are placed
   on a basis of equality before the law, and alike protected by the
   government in their property and right of public worship, yet
   self-supporting and self-governing; and, in turn, they strengthen the
   moral foundations of society by training loyal and virtuous citizens.
   Freedom of religion must be recognized as one of the inalienable rights
   of man, which lies in the sacred domain of conscience, beyond the
   restraint and control of politics, and which the government is bound to
   protect as much as any other fundamental right. Freedom is liable to
   abuse, and abuse may be punished. But Christianity is itself the parent
   of true freedom from the bondage of sin and error, and is the best
   protector and regulator of freedom.

   III. The history of Church Government and Discipline. The church is not
   only an invisible communion of saints, but at the same time a visible
   body, needing organs, laws, and forms, to regulate its activity. Into
   this department of history fall the various forms of church polity: the
   apostolic, the primitive episcopal, the patriarchal, the papal, the
   consistorial, the presbyterial, the congregational, etc.; and the
   history of the law and discipline of the church, and her relation to
   the state, under all these forms.

   IV. The history of Worship, or divine service, by which the church
   celebrates, revives, and strengthens her fellowship with her divine
   head. This falls into such subdivisions as the history of preaching, of
   catechisms, of liturgy, of rites and ceremonies, and of religious art,
   particularly sacred poetry and music.

   The history of church government and the history of worship are often
   put together under the title of Ecclesiastical Antiquities or
   Archaeology, and commonly confined to the patristic age, whence most of
   the, Catholic institutions and usages of the church date their origin.
   But they may as well be extended to the formative period of
   Protestantism.

   V. The history of Christian Life, or practical morality and religion:
   the exhibition of the distinguishing virtues and vices of different
   ages, of the development of Christian philanthropy, the regeneration of
   domestic life, the gradual abatement and abolition of slavery and other
   social evils, the mitigation and diminution of the horrors of war, the
   reform of civil law and of government, the spread of civil and
   religious liberty, and the whole progress of civilization, under the
   influence of Christianity.

   VI. The history of Theology, or of Christian learning and literature.
   Each branch of theology--exegetical, doctrinal, ethical, historical,
   and practical--has a history of its own.

   The history of doctrines or dogmas is here the most important, and is
   therefore frequently treated by itself. Its object is to show how the
   mind of the church has gradually apprehended and unfolded the divine
   truths of revelation, how the teachings of scripture have been
   formulated and shaped into dogmas, and grown into creeds and
   confessions of faith, or systems of doctrine stamped with public
   authority. This growth of the church in the knowledge of the infallible
   word of God is a constant struggle against error, misbelief, and
   unbelief; and the history of heresies is an essential part of the
   history of doctrines.

   Every important dogma now professed by the Christian church is the
   result of a severe conflict with error. The doctrine of the holy
   Trinity, for instance, was believed from the beginning, but it
   required, in addition to the preparatory labors of the ante-Nicene age,
   fifty years of controversy, in which the strongest intellects were
   absorbed, until it was brought to the clear expression of the
   Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. The Christological conflict was
   equally long and intense, until it was brought to a settlement by the
   council of Chalcedon. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was a
   continual warfare with popery. The doctrinal symbols of the various
   churches, from the Apostles' Creed down to the confessions of Dort and
   Westminster, and more recent standards, embody the results of the
   theological battles of the militant church.

   The various departments of church history have not a merely external
   and mechanical, but an organic relation to each other, and form one
   living whole, and this relation the historian must show. Each period
   also is entitled to a peculiar arrangement, according to its character.
   The number, order, and extent of the different divisions must be
   determined by their actual importance at a given time.

   [3] A well-known saying of Tertullian, who lived in the midst of
   persecution. A very different estimate of martyrdom is suggested by the
   Arabic proverb "The ink of the scholar is more precious than the blood
   of the martyr." The just estimate depends on the quality of the scholar
   and the quality of the martyr, and the cause for which the one lives
   and the other dies.

   § 3. Sources of Church History.

   The sources of church history, the data on which we rely for our
   knowledge, are partly divine, partly human. For the history of the
   kingdom of God from the creation to the close of the apostolic age, we
   have the inspired writings of the Old and New Testaments. But after the
   death of the apostles we have only human authorities, which of course
   cannot claim to be infallible. These human sources are partly written,
   partly unwritten.

   I. The written sources include:

   (a) Official documents of ecclesiastical and civil authorities: acts of
   councils and synods, confessions of faith, liturgies, church laws, and
   the official letters of popes, patriarchs, bishops, and representative
   bodies.

   (b) Private writings of personal actors in the history: the works of
   the church fathers, heretics, and heathen authors, for the first six
   centuries; of the missionaries, scholastic and mystic divines, for the
   middle age; and of the reformers and their opponents, for the sixteenth
   century. These documents are the richest mines for the historian. They
   give history in its birth and actual movement. But they must be
   carefully sifted and weighed; especially the controversial writings,
   where fact is generally more or less adulterated with party spirit,
   heretical and orthodox.

   (c) Accounts of chroniclers and historians, whether friends or enemies,
   who were eye-witnesses of what they relate. The value of these depends,
   of course, on the capacity and credibility of the authors, to be
   determined by careful criticism. Subsequent historians can be counted
   among the direct or immediate sources only so far as they have drawn
   from reliable and contemporary documents, which have either been wholly
   or partially lost, like many of Eusebius authorities for the period
   before Constantine, or are inaccessible to historians generally, as are
   the papal regesta and other documents of the Vatican library.

   (d) Inscriptions, especially those on tombs and catacombs, revealing
   the faith and hope of Christians in times of persecution. Among the
   ruins of Egypt and Babylonia whole libraries have been disentombed and
   deciphered, containing mythological and religious records, royal
   proclamations, historical, astronomical, and poetical compositions,
   revealing an extinct civilization and shedding light on some parts of
   Old Testament history.

   II. The Unwritten sources are far less numerous: church edifices, works
   of sculpture and painting, and other monuments, religious customs and
   ceremonies, very important for the history of worship and
   ecclesiastical art, and significant of the spirit of their age. [4]

   The works of art are symbolical embodiments of the various types of
   Christianity. The plain symbols and crude sculptures of the catacombs
   correspond to the period of persecution; the basilicas to the Nicene
   age; the Byzantine churches to the genius of the Byzantine
   state-churchism; the Gothic cathedrals to the Romano-Germanic
   catholicism of the middle ages; the renaissance style to the revival of
   letters.

   To come down to more recent times, the spirit of Romanism can be best
   appreciated amidst the dead and living monuments of Rome, Italy, and
   Spain. Lutheranism must be studied in Wittenberg, Northern Germany, and
   Scandinavia; Calvinism in Geneva, France, Holland, and Scotland;
   Anglicanism at Oxford, Cambridge, and London; Presbyterianism in
   Scotland and the United States; Congregationalism in England and New
   England. For in the mother countries of these denominations we
   generally find not only the largest printed and manuscript sources, but
   also the architectural, sculptural, sepulchral, and other monumental
   remains, the natural associations, oral traditions, and living
   representatives of the past, who, however they may have departed from
   the faith of their ancestors, still exhibit their national genius,
   social condition, habits, and customs--often in a far more instructive
   manner than ponderous printed volumes.

   § 4. Periods of Church History.

   The purely chronological or annalistic method, though pursued by the
   learned Baronius and his continuators, is now generally abandoned. It
   breaks the natural flow of events, separates things which belong
   together, and degrades history to a mere chronicle.

   The centurial plan, which prevailed from Flacius to Mosheim, is an
   improvement. It allows a much better view of the progress and
   connection of things. But it still imposes on the history a forced and
   mechanical arrangement; for the salient points or epochs very seldom
   coincide with the limits of our centuries. The rise of Constantine, for
   example, together with the union of church and state, dates from the
   year 311; that of the absolute papacy, in Hildebrand, from 1049; the
   Reformation from 1517; the peace of Westphalia took place in 1648; the
   landing of the Pilgrim Fathers of New England in 1620; the American
   emancipation in 1776; the French revolution in 1789; the revival of
   religious life in Germany began in 1817.

   The true division must grow out of the actual course of the history
   itself, and present the different phases of its development or stages
   of its life. These we call periods or ages. The beginning of a new
   period is called an epoch, or a stopping and starting point.

   In regard to the number and length of periods there is, indeed, no
   unanimity; the less, on account of the various denominational
   differences establishing different points of view, especially since the
   sixteenth century. The Reformation, for instance, has less importance
   for the Roman church than for the Protestant, and almost none for the
   Greek; and while the edict of Nantes forms a resting-place in the
   history of French Protestantism, and the treaty of Westphalia in that
   of German, neither of these events had as much to do with English
   Protestantism as the accession of Elizabeth, the rise of Cromwell, the
   restoration of the Stuarts, and the revolution of 1688.

   But, in spite of all confusion and difficulty in regard to details, it
   is generally agreed to divide the history of Christianity into three
   principal parts--ancient, mediaeval, and modern; though there is not a
   like agreement as to the dividing epochs, or points of departure and
   points of termination.

   I. The history of Ancient Christianity, from the birth of Christ to
   Gregory the Great. a.d. 1-590.

   This is the age of the Graeco-Latin church, or of the Christian
   Fathers. Its field is the countries around the Mediterranean--Western
   Asia, Northern Africa, and Southern Europe--just the theatre of the old
   Roman empire and of classic heathendom. This age lays the foundation,
   in doctrine, government, and worship, for all the subsequent history.
   It is the common progenitor of all the various confessions.

   The Life of Christ and the Apostolic Church are by far the most
   important sections, and require separate treatment. They form the
   divine-human groundwork of the church, and inspire, regulate, and
   correct all subsequent periods.

   Then, at the beginning of the fourth century, the accession of
   Constantine, the first Christian emperor, marks a decisive turn;
   Christianity rising from a persecuted sect to the prevailing religion
   of the Graeco-Roman empire. In the history of doctrines, the first
   oecumenical council of Nicaea, falling in the midst of Constantine's
   reign, a.d. 325, has the prominence of an epoch.

   Here, then, are three periods within the first or patristic era, which
   we may severally designate as the period of the Apostles, the period of
   the Martyrs, and the period of the Christian Emperors and Patriarchs.

   II. Medieval Christianity, from Gregory I to the Reformation. a.d.
   590-1517.

   The middle age is variously reckoned--from Constantine, 306 or 311;
   from the fall of the West Roman empire, 476; from Gregory the Great,
   590; from Charlemagne, 800. But it is very generally regarded as
   closing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and more precisely,
   at the outbreak of the Reformation in 1517. Gregory the Great seems to
   us to form the most proper ecclesiastical point of division. With him,
   the author of the Anglo-Saxon mission, the last of the church fathers,
   and the first of the proper popes, begins in earnest, and with decisive
   success, the conversion of the barbarian tribes, and, at the same time,
   the development of the absolute papacy, and the alienation of the
   eastern and western churches.

   This suggests the distinctive character of the middle age: the
   transition of the church from Asia and Africa to Middle and Western
   Europe, from the Graeco-Roman nationality to that of the Germanic,
   Celtic, and Slavonic races, and from the culture of the ancient classic
   world to the modern civilization. The great work of the church then was
   the conversion and education of the heathen barbarians, who conquered
   and demolished the Roman empire, indeed, but were themselves conquered
   and transformed by its Christianity. This work was performed mainly by
   the Latin church, under a firm hierarchical constitution, culminating
   in the bishop of Rome. The Greek church though she made some conquests
   among the Slavic tribes of Eastern Europe, particularly in the Russian
   empire, since grown so important, was in turn sorely pressed and
   reduced by Mohammedanism in Asia and Africa, the very seat of primitive
   Christianity, and at last in Constantinople itself; and in doctrine,
   worship, and organization, she stopped at the position of the
   oecumenical councils and the patriarchal constitution of the fifth
   century.

   In the middle age the development of the hierarchy occupies the
   foreground, so that it may be called the church of the Popes, as
   distinct from the ancient church of the Fathers, and the modern church
   of the Reformers.

   In the growth and decay of the Roman hierarchy three popes stand out as
   representatives of as many epochs: Gregory I., or the Great (590),
   marks the rise of absolute papacy; Gregory VII., or Hildebrand (1049),
   its summit; and Boniface VIII. (1294), its decline. We thus have again
   three periods in mediaeval church history. We may briefly distinguish
   them as the Missionary, the Papal, and the pre- or ante-Reformatory [5]
   ages of Catholicism.

   III. Modern Christianity, from the Reformation of the sixteenth century
   to the present time. a.d. 1517-1880.

   Modern history moves chiefly among the nations of Europe, and from the
   seventeenth century finds a vast new theatre in North America. Western
   Christendom now splits into two hostile parts--one remaining on the old
   path, the other striking out a new one; while the eastern church
   withdraws still further from the stage of history, and presents a scene
   of almost undisturbed stagnation, except in modern Russia and Greece.
   Modern church history is the age of Protestantism in conflict with
   Romanism, of religious liberty and independence in conflict with the
   principle of authority and tutelage, of individual and personal
   Christianity against an objective and traditional church system.

   Here again three different periods appear, which may be denoted briefly
   by the terms, Reformation, Revolution, and Revival.

   The sixteenth century, next to the apostolic age the most fruitful and
   interesting period of church history, is the century of the evangelical
   renovation of the Church, and the papal counter-reform. It is the
   cradle of all Protestant denominations and sects, and of modern
   Romanism.

   The seventeenth century is the period of scholastic orthodoxy, polemic
   confessionalism, and comparative stagnation. The reformatory motion
   ceases on the continent, but goes on in the mighty Puritanic struggle
   in England, and extends even into the primitive forests of the American
   colonies. The seventeenth century is the most fruitful in the church
   history of England, and gave rise to the various nonconformist or
   dissenting denominations which were transplanted to North America, and
   have out-grown some of the older historic churches. Then comes, in the
   eighteenth century, the Pietistic and Methodistic revival of practical
   religion in opposition to dead orthodoxy and stiff formalism. In the
   Roman church Jesuitism prevails but opposed by the half-evangelical
   Jansenism, and the quasiliberal Gallicanism.

   In the second half of the eighteenth century begins the vast
   overturning of traditional ideas and institutions, leading to
   revolution in state, and infidelity in church, especially in Roman
   Catholic France and Protestant Germany. Deism in England, atheism in
   France, rationalism in Germany, represent the various degrees of the
   great modern apostasy from the orthodox creeds.

   The nineteenth century presents, in part, the further development of
   these negative and destructive tendencies, but with it also the revival
   of Christian faith and church life, and the beginnings of a new
   creation by the everlasting gospel. The revival may be dated from the
   third centenary of the Reformation, in 1817.

   In the same period North America, English and Protestant in its
   prevailing character, but presenting an asylum for all the nations,
   churches, and sects of the old world, with a peaceful separation of the
   temporal and the spiritual power, comes upon the stage like a young
   giant full of vigor and promise.

   Thus we have, in all, nine periods of church history, as follows:

   First Period:
   The Life of Christ, and the Apostolic church.
   From the Incarnation to the death of St. John. a.d. 1-100.

   Second Period:
   Christianity under persecution in the Roman empire.
   From the death of St. John to Constantine, the first Christian emperor.
   a.d. 100-311.

   Third Period:
   Christianity in union with the Graeco-Roman empire, and amidst the
   storms of the great migration of nations.
   From Constantine the Great to Pope Gregory I. a.d. 311-590.

   Fourth Period:
   Christianity planted among the Teutonic, Celtic, and Slavonic nations.
   From Gregory I. to Hildebrand, or Gregory VII. a.d. 590-1049.

   Fifth Period:
   The Church under the papal hierarchy, and the scholastic theology.
   From Gregory VII. to Boniface VIII. a.d. 1049-1294.

   Sixth Period:
   The decay of mediaeval Catholicism, and the preparatory movements for
   the Reformation.
   From Boniface VIII. to Luther. a.d. 1294-1517.

   Seventh Period:
   The evangelical Reformation, and the Roman Catholic Reaction.
   From Luther to the Treaty of Westphalia. a.d. 1517-1648.

   Eighth Period:
   The age of polemic orthodoxy and exclusive confessionalism, with
   reactionary and progressive movements.
   From the Treaty of Westphalia to the French Revolution. a.d. 1648-1790.

   Ninth Period:
   The spread of infidelity, and the revival of Christianity in Europe and
   America, with missionary efforts encircling the globe.
   From the French Revolution to the present time. a.d. 1790-1880.

   Christianity has thus passed through many stages of its earthly life,
   and yet has hardly reached the period of full manhood in Christ Jesus.
   During this long succession of centuries it has outlived the
   destruction of Jerusalem, the dissolution of the Roman empire, fierce
   persecutions from without, and heretical corruptions from within, the
   barbarian invasion, the confusion of the dark ages, the papal tyranny,
   the shock of infidelity, the ravages of revolution, the attacks of
   enemies and the errors of friends, the rise and fall of proud kingdoms,
   empires, and republics, philosophical systems, and social organizations
   without number. And, behold, it still lives, and lives in greater
   strength and wider extent than ever; controlling the progress of
   civilization, and the destinies of the world; marching over the ruins
   of human wisdom and folly, ever forward and onward; spreading silently
   its heavenly blessings from generation to generation, and from country
   to country, to the ends of the earth. It can never die; it will never
   see the decrepitude of old age; but, like its divine founder, it will
   live in the unfading freshness of self-renewing youth and the unbroken
   vigor of manhood to the end of time, and will outlive time itself.
   Single denominations and sects, human forms of doctrine, government,
   and worship, after having served their purpose, may disappear and go
   the way of all flesh; but the Church Universal of Christ, in her divine
   life and substance, is too strong for the gates of hell. She will only
   exchange her earthly garments for the festal dress of the Lamb's Bride,
   and rise from the state of humiliation to the state of exaltation and
   glory. Then at the coming of Christ she will reap the final harvest of
   history, and as the church triumphant in heaven celebrate and enjoy the
   eternal sabbath of holiness and peace. This will be the endless end of
   history, as it was foreshadowed already at the beginning of its course
   in the holy rest of God after the completion of his work of creation.

   Luther. But this is the case with every other single term we may

   § 5. Uses of Church History.

   Church history is the most extensive, and, including the sacred history
   of the Old and New Testaments, the most important branch of theology.
   It is the backbone of theology or which it rests, and the storehouse
   from which it derives its supplies. It is the best commentary of
   Christianity itself, under all its aspects and in all its bearings. The
   fulness of the stream is the glory of the fountain from which it flows.

   Church history has, in the first place, a general interest for every
   cultivated mind, as showing the moral and religious development of our
   race, and the gradual execution of the divine plan of redemption.

   It has special value for the theologian and minister of the gospel, as
   the key to the present condition of Christendom and the guide to
   successful labor in her cause. The present is the fruit of the past,
   and the germ of the future. No work can stand unless it grow out of the
   real wants of the age and strike firm root in the soil of history. No
   one who tramples on the rights of a past generation can claim the
   regard of its posterity. Church history is no mere curiosity shop. Its
   facts are not dry bones, but embody living realities, the general
   principles and laws for our own guidance and action. Who studies church
   history studies Christianity itself in all its phases, and human nature
   under the influence of Christianity as it now is, and will be to the
   end of time.

   Finally, the history of the church has practical value for every
   Christian, as a storehouse of warning and encouragement, of consolation
   and counsel. It is the philosophy of facts, Christianity in living
   examples. If history in general be, as Cicero describes it, "testis
   temporum, lux veritatis, et magistra vitae," or, as Diodorus calls it,
   "the handmaid of providence, the priestess of truth, and the mother of
   wisdom," the history of the kingdom of heaven is all these in the
   highest degree. Next to the holy scriptures, which are themselves a
   history and depository of divine revelation, there is no stronger proof
   of the continual presence of Christ with his people, no more thorough
   vindication of Christianity, no richer source of spiritual wisdom and
   experience, no deeper incentive to virtue and piety, than the history
   of Christ's kingdom. Every age has a message from God to man, which it
   is of the greatest importance for man to understand.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews describes, in stirring eloquence, the cloud
   of witnesses from the old dispensation for the encouragement of the
   Christians. Why should not the greater cloud of apostles, evangelists,
   martyrs, confessors, fathers, reformers, and saints of every age and
   tongue, since the coming of Christ, be held up for the same purpose?
   They were the heroes of Christian faith and love, the living epistles
   of Christ, the salt of the earth, the benefactors and glory of our
   race; and it is impossible rightly to study their thoughts and deeds,
   their lives and deaths, without being elevated, edified, comforted, and
   encouraged to follow their holy example, that we at last, by the grace
   of God, be received into their fellowship, to spend with them a blessed
   eternity in the praise and enjoyment of the same God and Saviour.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Duty of the Historian.

   The first duty of the historian, which comprehends all others, is
   fidelity and justice. He must reproduce the history itself, making it
   live again in his representation. His highest and only aim should be,
   like a witness, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
   truth, and, like a judge, to do full justice to every person and event
   which comes under his review.

   To be thus faithful and just he needs a threefold
   qualification--scientific, artistic, and religious.

   1. He must master the sources. For this purpose he must be acquainted
   with such auxiliary sciences as ecclesiastical philology (especially
   the Greek and Latin languages, in which most of the earliest documents
   are written), secular history, geography, and chronology. Then, in
   making use of the sources, he must thoroughly and impartially examine
   their genuineness and integrity, and the credibility and capacity of
   the witnesses. Thus only can he duly separate fact from fiction, truth
   from error.

   The number of sources for general history is so large and increasing so
   rapidly, that it is, of course, impossible to read and digest them all
   in a short lifetime. Every historian rests on the shoulders of his
   predecessors. He must take some things on trust even after the most
   conscientious search, and avail himself of the invaluable aid of
   documentary collections and digests, ample indexes, and exhaustive
   monographs, where he cannot examine all the primary sources in detail.
   Only he should always carefully indicate his authorities and verify
   facts, dates, and quotations. A want of accuracy is fatal to the
   reputation of an historical work.

   2. Then comes the composition. This is an art. It must not simply
   recount events, but reproduce the development of the church in living
   process. History is not a heap of skeletons, but an organism filled and
   ruled by a reasonable soul.

   One of the greatest difficulties here lies in arranging the material.
   The best method is to combine judiciously the chronological and topical
   principles of division; presenting at once the succession of events and
   the several parallel (and, indeed, interwoven) departments of the
   history in due proportion. Accordingly, we first divide the whole
   history into periods, not arbitrary, but determined by the actual
   course of events; and then we present each of these periods in as many
   parallel sections or chapters as the material itself requires. As to
   the number of the periods and chapters, and as to the arrangement of
   the chapters, there are indeed conflicting opinions, and in the
   application of our principle, as in our whole representation, we can
   only make approaches to perfection. But the principle itself is,
   nevertheless, the only true one.

   The ancient classical historians, and most of the English and French,
   generally present their subject in one homogeneous composition of
   successive books or chapters, without rubrical division. This method
   might seem to bring out better the living unity and variety of the
   history at every point. Yet it really does not. Language, unlike the
   pencil and the chisel, can exhibit only the succession in time, not the
   local concomitance. And then this method, rigidly pursued, never gives
   a complete view of any one subject, of doctrine, worship, or practical
   life. It constantly mixes the various topics, breaking off from one to
   bring up another, even by the most sudden transitions, till the
   alternation is exhausted. The German method of periodical and rubrical
   arrangement has great practical advantages for the student, in bringing
   to view the order of subjects as well as the order of time. But it
   should not be made a uniform and monotonous mechanism, as is done in
   the Magdeburg Centuries and many subsequent works. For, while history
   has its order, both of subject and of time, it is yet, like all life,
   full of variety. The period of the Reformation requires a very
   different arrangement from the middle age; and in modern history the
   rubrical division must be combined with and made subject to a division
   by confessions and countries, as the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed
   churches in Germany, France, England, and America.

   The historian should aim then to reproduce both the unity and the
   variety of history, presenting the different topics in their separate
   completeness, without overlooking their organic connection. The scheme
   must not be arbitrarily made, and then pedantically applied, as a
   Procrustean framework, to the history; but it must be deduced from the
   history itself, and varied as the facts require.

   Another difficulty even greater than the arrangement of the material
   consists in the combination of brevity and fulness. A general church
   history should give a complete view of the progress of Christ's kingdom
   in all its departments. But the material is so vast and constantly
   increasing, that the utmost condensation should be studied by a
   judicious selection of the salient points, which really make up the
   main body of history. There is no use in writing books unless they are
   read. But who has time in this busy age to weary through the forty
   folios of Baronius and his continuators, or the thirteen folios of
   Flacius, or the forty-five octaves of Schroeckh? The student of
   ecclesiastical history, it is true, wants not miniature pictures only
   (as in Hase's admirable compend), but full-length portraits. Yet much
   space may be gained by omitting the processes and unessential details,
   which may be left to monographs and special treatises. Brevity is a
   virtue in the historian, unless it makes him obscure and enigmatic. [6]

   The historian, moreover, must make his work readable and interesting,
   without violating truth. Some parts of history are dull and wearisome;
   but, upon the whole, the truth of history is "stranger than fiction."
   It is God's own epos. It needs no embellishment. It speaks for itself
   if told with earnestness, vivacity, and freshness. Unfortunately,
   church historians, with very few exceptions, are behind the great
   secular historians in point of style, and represent the past as a dead
   corpse rather than as a living and working power of abiding interest.
   Hence church histories are so little read outside of professional
   circles.

   3. Both scientific research and artistic representation must be guided
   by a sound moral and religious, that is, a truly Christian spirit. The
   secular historian should be filled with universal human sympathy, the
   church historian with universal Christian sympathy. The motto of the
   former is: "Homo sum, nihil humani a me alienum puto;" the motto of the
   latter: "Christianus sum, nihil Christiani a me alienum puto."

   The historian must first lay aside all prejudice and party zeal, and
   proceed in the pure love of truth. Not that he must become a tabula
   rasa. No man is able, or should attempt, to cast off the educational
   influences which have made him what he is. But the historian of the
   church of Christ must in every thing be as true as possible to the
   objective fact, "sine ira et studio;" do justice to every person and
   event; and stand in the centre of Christianity, whence he may see all
   points in the circumference, all individual persons and events, all
   confessions, denominations, and sects, in their true relations to each
   other and to the glorious whole. The famous threefold test of catholic
   truth--universality of time (semper), place (ubique), and number (ab
   omnibus)--in its literal sense, is indeed untrue and inapplicable.
   Nevertheless, there is a common Christianity in the Church, as well as
   a common humanity in the world, which no Christian can disregard with
   impunity. Christ is the divine harmony of all the discordant human
   creeds and sects. It is the duty and the privilege of the historian to
   trace the image of Christ in the various physiognomies of his
   disciples, and to act as a mediator between the different sections of
   his kingdom.

   Then he must be in thorough sympathy with his subject, and
   enthusiastically devoted thereto. As no one can interpret a poet
   without poetic feeling and taste, or a philosopher without speculative
   talent, so no one can rightly comprehend and exhibit the history of
   Christianity without a Christian spirit. An unbeliever could produce
   only a repulsive caricature, or at best a lifeless statue. The higher
   the historian stands on Christian ground, the larger is his horizon,
   and the more full and clear his view of single regions below, and of
   their mutual bearings. Even error can be fairly seen only from the
   position of truth. "Verum est index sui et falsi." Christianity is the
   absolute truth, which, like the sun, both reveals itself and enlightens
   all that is dark. Church history, like the Bible, is its own best
   interpreter.

   So far as the historian combines these three qualifications, he fulfils
   his office. In this life we can, of course, only distantly approach
   perfection in this or in any other branch of study. Absolute success
   would require infallibility; and this is denied to mortal man. It is
   the exclusive privilege of the Divine mind to see the end from the
   beginning, and to view events from all sides and in all their bearings;
   while the human mind can only take up things consecutively and view
   them partially or in fragments.

   The full solution of the mysteries of history is reserved for that
   heavenly state, when we shall see no longer through a gloss darkly, but
   face to face, and shall survey the developments of time from the
   heights of eternity. What St. Augustine so aptly says of the mutual
   relation of the Old and New Testament, "Novum Testamentum in Vetere
   latet, Vetus in Novo patet," may be applied also to the relation of
   this world and the world to come. The history of the church militant is
   but a type and a prophecy of the triumphant kingdom of God in heaven--a
   prophecy which will be perfectly understood only in the light of its
   fulfilment.

   Nicht der aus dem Schutt der Zeiten
   Wühle mehr Erbärmlichkeiten,

   Like every other science and art, church historiography has a history
   of development toward its true perfection. This history exhibits not
   only a continual growth of material, but also a gradual, though
   sometimes long interrupted, improvement of method, from the mere
   collection of names and dates in a Christian chronicle, to critical
   research and discrimination, pragmatic reference to causes and motives,
   scientific command of material, philosophical generalization, and
   artistic reproduction of the actual history itself. In this progress
   also are marked the various confessional and denominational phases of
   Christianity, giving different points of view, and consequently
   different conceptions and representations of the several periods and
   divisions of Christendom; so that the development of the Church itself
   is mirrored in the development of church historiography.

   We can here do no more than mention the leading works which mark the
   successive epochs in the growth of our science.

   I. The Apostolic Church.

   The first works on church history are the canonical Gospels of Matthew,
   Mark, Luke, and John, the inspired biographical memoirs of Jesus
   Christ, who is the theanthropic head of the Church universal.

   These are followed by Luke's Acts of the Apostles, which describes the
   planting of Christianity among Jews and Gentiles from Jerusalem to
   Rome, by the labors of the apostles, especially Peter and Paul.

   II. The Greek Church historians.

   The first post-apostolic works on church history, as indeed all
   branches of theological literature, take their rise in the Greek
   Church.

   Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine, and contemporary with
   Constantine the Great, composed a church history in ten books
   (ejkklhsiastikh; iJstoriva, from the incarnation of the Logos to the
   year 324), by which he has won the title of the Father of church
   history, or the Christian Herodotus. Though by no means very critical
   and discerning, and far inferior in literary talent and execution to
   the works of the great classical historians, this ante-Nicene church
   history is invaluable for its learning, moderation, and love of truth;
   for its use of sources, since totally or partially lost; and for its
   interesting position of personal observation between the last
   persecutions of the church and her establishment in the Byzantine
   empire.

   Eusebius was followed in similar spirit and on the same plan by
   Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret in the fifth century, and Theodorus
   and Evagrius in the sixth, each taking up the thread of the narrative
   where his predecessor had dropped it, and covering in part the same
   ground, from Constantine the Great till toward the middle of the fifth
   century. [7]

   Of the later Greek historians, from the seventh century, to the
   fifteenth, the "Scriptores Byzantini," as they are called, Nicephorus
   Callisti (son of Callistus, about a.d. 1333) deserves special regard.
   His Ecclesiastical History was written with the use of the large
   library of the church of St. Sophia in Constantinople, and dedicated to
   the emperor Andronicus Palaeologus (d. 1327). It extends in eighteen
   books (each of which begins with a letter of his name) from the birth
   of Christ to the death of Phocas, a.d. 610, and gives in the preface a
   summary of five books more, which would have brought it down to 911. He
   was an industrious and eloquent, but uncritical and superstitious
   writer. [8]

   III. Latin Church historians of the middle ages.

   The Latin Church, before the Reformation, was, in church history, as in
   all other theological studies, at first wholly dependent on the Greek,
   and long content with mere translations and extracts from Eusebius and
   his continuators.

   The most popular of these was the Historia Tripartita, composed by
   Cassiodorus, prime minister of Theodoric, and afterwards abbot of a
   convent in Calabria (d. about a.d. 562). It is a compilation from the
   histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, abridging and
   harmonizing them, and supplied--together with the translation of
   Eusebius by Rufinus--the West for several centuries with its knowledge
   of the fortunes of the ancient church.

   The middle age produced no general church history of consequence, but a
   host of chronicles, and histories of particular nations, monastic
   orders, eminent popes, bishops, missionaries, saints, etc. Though
   rarely worth much as compositions, these are yet of great value as
   material, after a careful sifting of truth from legendary fiction.

   The principal mediaeval historians are Gregory of Tours (d. 595), who
   wrote a church history of the Franks; the Venerable Bede, (d. 735), the
   father of English church history; Paulus Diaconus (d. 799), the
   historian of the Lombards; Adam of Bremen, the chief authority for
   Scandinavian church history from a.d. 788-1072; Haimo (or Haymo, Aimo,
   a monk of Fulda, afterwards bishop of Halberstadt, d. 853), who
   described in ten books, mostly from Rufinus, the history of the first
   four centuries (Hist oriae Sacrae Epitome); Anastasius (about 872), the
   author in part of the Liber Pontificalis, i.e., biographies of the
   Popes till Stephen VI. (who died 891); Bartholomaeus of Lucca. (about
   1312), who composed a general church history from Christ to a.d. 1312;
   St. Antoninus (Antonio Pierozzi), archbishop of Florence (d. 1459), the
   author of the largest mediaeval work on secular and sacred history
   (Summa Historialis), from the creation to a.d. 1457.

   Historical criticism began with the revival of letters, and revealed
   itself first in the doubts of Laurentius Valla (d. 1457) and Nicolaus
   of Cusa (d. 1464) concerning the genuineness of the donation of
   Constantine, the Isidorian Decretals, and other spurious documents,
   which are now as universally rejected as they were once universally
   accepted.

   IV. Roman Catholic historians.

   The Roman Catholic Church was roused by the shock of the Reformation,
   in the sixteenth century, to great activity in this and other
   departments of theology, and produced some works of immense learning
   and antiquarian research, but generally characterized rather by zeal
   for the papacy, and against Protestantism, than by the purely
   historical spirit. Her best historians are either Italians, and
   ultramontane in spirit, or Frenchmen, mostly on the side of the more
   liberal but less consistent Gallicanism.

   (a) Italians:

   First stands the Cardinal Caesar Baronius (d. 1607), with his Annales
   Ecclesiastici(Rom. 1588 sqq.), in 12 folio volumes, on which he spent
   thirty years of unwearied study. They come down only to the year 1198,
   but are continued by Raynaldi (to 1565), Laderchi (to 1571), and
   Theiner (to 1584). [9]

   This truly colossal and monumental work is even to this day an
   invaluable storehouse of information from the Vatican library and other
   archives, and will always be consulted by professional scholars. It is
   written in dry, ever broken, unreadable style, and contains many
   spurious documents. It stands wholly on the ground of absolute papacy,
   and is designed as a positive refutation of the Magdeburg Centuries,
   though it does not condescend directly to notice them. It gave immense
   aid and comfort to the cause of Romanism, and was often epitomized and
   popularized in several languages. But it was also severely criticized,
   and in part refuted, not only by such Protestants as Casaubon,
   Spanheim, and Samuel Basnage, but by Roman Catholic scholars also,
   especially two French Franciscans, Antoine and François Pagi, who
   corrected the chronology.

   Far less known and used than the Annals of Baronius is the Historia
   Ecclesiasticaof Caspar Sacharelli, which comes down to a.d. 1185, and
   was published in Rome, 1771-1796, in 25 quarto volumes.

   Invaluable contributions to historical collections and special
   researches have been made by other Italian scholars, as Muratori,
   Zaccagni, Zaccaria, Mansi, Gallandi, Paolo Sarpi, Pallavicini (the last
   two on the Council of Trent), the three Assemani, and Angelo Mai

   (b) French Catholic historians.

   Natalis (Noel) Alexander, Professor and Provincial of the Dominican
   order (d. 1724), wrote his Historia Ecclesiastica Veteris et Nova
   Testamentito the year 1600 (Paris, 1676, 2d ed. 1699 sqq. 8 vols. fol.)
   in the spirit of Gallicanism, with great learning, but in dry
   scholastic style. Innocent XI. put it in the Index (1684). This gave
   rise to the corrected editions.

   The abbot Claude Fleury (d. 1723), in his Histoire ecclésiastique(Par.
   1691-1720, in 20 vols. quarto, down to a.d. 1414, continued by Claude
   Fabre, a very decided Gallican, to a.d. 1595), furnished a much more
   popular work, commended by mildness of spirit and fluency of style, and
   as useful for edification as for instruction. It is a minute and, upon
   the whole, accurate narrative of the course of events as they occurred,
   but without system and philosophical generalization, and hence tedious
   and wearisome. When Fleury was asked why he unnecessarily darkened his
   pages with so many discreditable facts, he properly replied that the
   survival and progress of Christianity, notwithstanding the vices and
   crimes of its professors and preachers, was the best proof of its
   divine origin. [10]

   Jacques Bénigne Bossuet, the distinguished bishop of Meaux (d. 1704),
   an advocate of Romanism on the one hand against Protestantism, but of
   Gallicanism on the other against Ultramontanism, wrote with brilliant
   eloquence, and in the spirit of the Catholic church, a universal
   history, in bold outlines for popular effect. [11] This was continued
   in the German language by the Protestant Cramer, with less elegance but
   more thoroughness, and with special reference to the doctrine history
   of the middle age.

   Sebastien le Nain de Tillemont (d. 1698), a French nobleman and priest,
   without office and devoted exclusively to study and prayer--a pupil and
   friend of the Jansenists and in partial sympathy with
   Gallicanism--composed a most learned and useful history of the first
   six centuries (till 513), in a series of minute biographies, with great
   skill and conscientiousness, almost entirely in the words of the
   original authorities, from which he carefully distinguishes his own
   additions. It is, as far as it goes, the most valuable church history
   produced by Roman Catholic industry and learning. [12]

   Contemporaneously with Tillemont, the Gallican, L. Ellies Dupin (d.
   1719), furnished a biographical and bibliographical church history down
   to the seventeenth century. [13] Remi Ceillier (d. 1761) followed with
   a similar work, which has the advantage of greater completeness and
   accuracy. [14] The French Benedictines of the congregation of St. Maur,
   in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, did immense service to
   historical theology by the best critical editions of the fathers and
   extensive archaeological works. We can only mention the names of
   Mabillon, Massuet, Montfaucon, D'achery, Ruinart, Martène, Durand.
   Among the Jesuits, Sirmond and Petau occupy a prominent place.

   The Abbé Rohrbacher. (Professor of Church History at Nancy, d. 1856)
   wrote an extensive Universal History of the Church, including that of
   the Old Testament, down to 1848. It is less liberal than the great
   Gallican writers of the seventeenth century, but shows familiarity with
   German literature. [15]

   (c) German Catholic historians.

   The pioneer of modern German Catholic historians of note is a poet and
   an ex-Protestant, Count Leopold Von Stolberg (d. 1819). With the
   enthusiasm of an honest, noble, and devout, but credulous convert, he
   began, in 1806, a very full Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi, and
   brought it down in 15 volumes to the year 430. It was continued by F.
   Kerz (vols. 16-45, to a.d. 1192) and J. N. Brischar (vols. 45-53, to
   a.d. 1245).

   Theod. Katerkamp (d. at Münster, 1834) wrote a church history, in the
   same spirit and pleasing style, down to a.d. 1153. [16] It remained
   unfinished, like the work of Locherer(d. 1837), which extends to 1073.
   [17]

   Bishop Hefele's History of the Councils(Conciliengeschichte, 1855-'86;
   revised edition and continuation, 1873 sqq.) is a most valuable
   contribution to the history of doctrine and discipline down to the
   Council of Trent. [18]

   The best compendious histories from the pens of German Romanists are
   produced by Jos. Ign. Ritter, Professor in Bonn and afterward in
   Breslau (d. 1857); [19] Joh. Adam Möhler, formerly Professor in
   Tübingen, and then in Munich, the author of the famous Symbolik(d.
   1838); [20] Joh. Alzog (d. 1878); [21] H. Brück (Mayence, 2d ed.,
   1877); F. X. Kraus (Treves, 1873; 3d ed., 1882); Card.
   Hergenröther(Freiburg, 3d ed., 1886, 3 vols.); F. X. Funk (Tübingen,
   1886; 2d ed., 1890).

   A. F. Gfrörer (d. 1861) began his learned General Church History as a
   Protestant, or rather as a Rationalist (1841-'46, 4 vols., till a.d.
   1056), and continued it from Gregory VII. on as a Romanist (1859-'61).

   Dr. John Joseph Ignatius Döllinger (Professor in Munich, born 1799),
   the most learned historian of the Roman Church in the nineteenth
   century, represents the opposite course from popery to anti-popery. He
   began, but never finished, a Handbook of Christian Church
   History(Landshut, 1833, 2 vols.) till a.d. 680, and a Manual of Church
   History(1836, 2d ed., 1843, 2 vols.) to the fifteenth century, and in
   part to 1517. [22] He wrote also learned works against the Reformation
   (Die Reformation, 1846-'48, in 3 vols.), on Hippolytus and Callistus
   (1853), on the preparation for Christianity (Heidenthum u Judenthum,
   1857), Christianity and the Church in the time of its Founding (1860),
   The Church and the Churches (1862), Papal Fables of the Middle Age
   (1865), The Pope and the Council (under the assumed name of "Janus,"
   1869), etc.

   During the Vatican Council in 1870 Döllinger broke with Rome, became
   the theological leader of the Old Catholic recession, and was
   excommunicated by the Archbishop of Munich (his former pupil), April
   17, 1871, as being guilty of "the crime of open and formal heresy." He
   knows too much of church history to believe in the infallibility of the
   pope. He solemnly declared (March 28, 1871) that "as a Christian, as a
   theologian, as a historian, and as a citizen," he could not accept the
   Vatican decrees, because they contradict the spirit of the gospel and
   the genuine tradition of the church, and, if carried out, must involve
   church and state, the clergy and the laity, in irreconcilable conflict.

   V. The Protestant Church historians.

   The Reformation of the sixteenth century is the mother of church
   history as a science and art in the proper sense of term. It seemed at
   first to break off from the past and to depreciate church history, by
   going back directly to the Bible as the only rule of faith and
   practice, and especially to look most unfavorably on the Catholic
   middle age, as a progressive corruption of the apostolic doctrine and
   discipline. But, on the other hand, it exalted primitive Christianity,
   and awakened a new and enthusiastic interest in all the documents of
   the apostolic church, with an energetic effort to reproduce its spirit
   and institutions. It really repudiated only the later tradition in
   favor of the older, taking its stand upon the primitive historical
   basis of Christianity. Then again, in the course of controversy with
   Rome, Protestantism found it desirable and necessary to wrest from its
   opponent not only the scriptural argument, but also the historical, and
   to turn it as far as possible to the side of the evangelical cause. For
   the Protestants could never deny that the true Church of Christ is
   built on a rock, and has the promise of indestructible permanence.
   Finally, the Reformation, by, liberating the mind from the yoke of a
   despotic ecclesiastical authority, gave an entirely new impulse,
   directly or indirectly to free investigation in every department, and
   produced that historical criticism which claims to clear fact from the
   accretions of fiction, and to bring out the truth, the whole truth, and
   nothing but the truth, of history. Of course this criticism may run to
   the extreme of rationalism and scepticism, which oppose the authority
   of the apostles and of Christ himself; as it actually did for a time,
   especially in Germany. But the abuse of free investigation proves
   nothing against the right use of it; and is to be regarded only as a
   temporary aberration, from which all sound minds will return to a due
   appreciation of history, as a truly rational unfolding of the plan of
   redemption, and a standing witness for the all-ruling providence of
   God, and the divine character of the Christian religion.

   (a) German, Swiss, and Dutch historians.

   Protestant church historiography has thus far flourished most on German
   soil. A patient and painstaking industry and conscientious love of
   truth and justice qualify German scholars for the mining operations of
   research which bring forth the raw material for the manufacturer; while
   French and English historians know best how to utilize and popularize
   the material for the general reader.

   The following are the principal works:

   Matthias Flacius (d 1575), surnamed Illyricus, a zealous Lutheran, and
   an unsparing enemy of Papists, Calvinists, and Melancthonians, heads
   the list of Protestant historians with his great Eccelesiastica
   Historia Novi Testamenti, commonly called Centuriae
   Magdeburgenses(Basle, 1560-'74), covering thirteen centuries of the
   Christian era in as many folio volumes. He began the work in Magdeburg,
   in connection with ten other, scholars of like Spirit and zeal, and in
   the face of innumerable difficulties, for the purpose of exposing the
   corruptions and, errors of the papacy, and of proving the doctrines of
   the Lutheran Reformation orthodox by the "witnesses of the truth" in
   all ages. The tone is therefore controversial throughout, and quite as
   partial as that of the Annals of Baronius on the papal side. The style
   is tasteless and repulsive, but the amount of persevering labor, the
   immense, though ill-digested and unwieldy mass of material, and the
   boldness of the criticism, are imposing and astonishing. The
   "Centuries" broke the path of free historical study, and are the first
   general church history deserving of the name. They introduced also a
   new method. They divide the material by centuries, and each century by
   a uniform Procrustean scheme of not less than sixteen rubrics: "de loco
   et propagatione ecclesiae; de persecutione et tranquillitate ecclesiae;
   de doctrina; de haeresibus; de ceremoniis; de politia; de schismatibus;
   de conciliis; de vitis episcoporum; de haereticis; de martyribus; de
   miraculis et prodigiis; de rebus Judaicis; de aliis religionibus; de
   mutationibus politicis." This plan destroys all symmetry, and occasions
   wearisome diffuseness and repetition. Yet, in spite of its mechanical
   uniformity and stiffness, it is more scientific than the annalistic or
   chronicle method, and, with material improvements and considerable
   curtailment of rubrics, it has been followed to this day.

   The Swiss, J. H. Hottinger (d. 1667), in his Historia Ecclesiastica N.
   Testamenti(Zurich, 1655-'67, 9 vols. fol.), furnished a Reformed
   counterpart to the Magdeburg Centuries. It is less original and
   vigorous, but more sober and moderate. It comes down to the sixteenth
   century, to which alone five volumes are devoted.

   From Fred. Spanheim of Holland (d. 1649) we have a Summa Historia
   Ecclesiasticae (Lugd. Bat. 1689), coming down to the sixteenth century.
   It is based on a thorough and critical knowledge of the sources, and
   serves at the same time as a refutation of Baronius.

   A new path was broken by Gottfried Arnold (d. 1714), in his, Impartial
   History of the Church and Hereticsto a.d. 1688. [24] He is the
   historian of the pietistic and mystic school. He made subjective piety
   the test of the true faith, and the persecuted sects the main channel
   of true Christianity; while the reigning church from Constantine down,
   and indeed not the Catholic church only, but the orthodox Lutheran with
   it, he represented as a progressive apostasy, a Babylon full of
   corruption and abomination. In this way he boldly and effectually broke
   down the walls of ecclesiastical exclusiveness and bigotry; but at the
   same time, without intending or suspecting it, he opened the way to a
   rationalistic and sceptical treatment of history. While, in his zeal
   for impartiality and personal piety, he endeavored to do justice to all
   possible heretics and sectaries, he did great injustice to the
   supporters of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical order. Arnold was also the
   first to use the German language instead of the Latin in learned
   history; but his style is tasteless and insipid.

   J. L. von Mosheim (Chancellor of the University at Göttingen, d. 1755),
   a moderate and impartial Lutheran, is the father of church
   historiography as an art, unless we prefer to concede this merit to
   Bossuet. In skilful construction, clear, though mechanical and
   monotonous arrangement, critical sagacity, pragmatic combination,
   freedom from passion, almost bordering on cool indifferentism, and in
   easy elegance of Latin style, he surpasses all his predecessors. His
   well-known Institutiones Historiae Ecclesiasticae antiquae et
   recentioris(Helmstädt, 1755) follows the centurial plan of Flacius, but
   in simpler form, and, as translated and supplemented by Maclaine, and
   Murdock, is still used extensively as a text-book in England and
   America. [25]

   J. M. Schröckh (d. 1808), a pupil of Mosheim, but already touched with
   the neological spirit which Semler (d. 1791) introduced into the
   historical theology of Germany, wrote with unwearied industry the
   largest Protestant church history after the Magdeburg Centuries. He
   very properly forsook the centurial plan still followed by Mosheim, and
   adopted the periodic. His Christian Church History comprises forty-five
   volumes, and reaches to the end of the eighteenth century. It is
   written in diffuse but clear and easy style, with reliable knowledge of
   sources, and in a mild and candid spirit, and is still a rich
   storehouse of historical matter. [26]

   The very learned Institutiones Historiae Ecclesiasticae V. et N.
   Testamentiof the Dutch Reformed divine, H. Venema (d. 1787), contain
   the history of the Jewish and Christian Church down to the end of the
   sixteenth century (Lugd. Bat. 1777-'83, in seven parts).

   H. P. C. Henke (d. 1809) is the leading representative of the
   rationalistic church historiography, which ignores Christ in history.
   In his spirited and able Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Kirche,
   continued by Vater (Braunschweig, 1788-1820, 9 vols.), the church
   appears not as the temple of God on earth, but as a great infirmary and
   bedlam.

   August Neander. (Professor of Church History in Berlin, d. 1850), the
   "father of modern church history," a child in spirit, a giant in
   learning, and a saint in piety, led back the study of history from the
   dry heath of rationalism to the fresh fountain of divine life in
   Christ, and made it a grand source of edification as well as
   instruction for readers of every creed. His General History of the
   Christian Religion and Church begins after the apostolic age (which he
   treated in a separate work), and comes down to the Council of Basle in
   1430, the continuation being interrupted by his death. [27] It is
   distinguished for thorough and conscientious use of the sources,
   critical research, ingenious combination, tender love of truth and
   justice, evangelical catholicity, hearty piety, and by masterly
   analysis of the doctrinal systems and the subjective Christian life of
   men of God in past ages. The edifying character is not introduced from
   without, but naturally grows out of his conception of church history,
   viewed as a continuous revelation of Christ's presence and power in
   humanity, and as an illustration of the parable of the leaven which
   gradually pervades and transforms the whole lump. The political and
   artistic sections, and the outward machinery of history, were not
   congenial to the humble, guileless simplicity of Neander. His style is
   monotonous, involved, and diffuse, but unpretending, natural, and
   warmed by a genial glow of sympathy and enthusiasm. It illustrates his
   motto: Pectus est quod theologum facit.

   Torrey's excellent translation (Rose translated only the first three
   centuries), published in Boston, Edinburgh, and London, in multiplied
   editions, has given Neander's immortal work even a much larger
   circulation in England and America than it has in Germany itself.

   Besides this general history, Neander's indefatigable industry produced
   also special works on the Life of Christ (1837, 4th ed. 1845), the
   Apostolic Age (1832, 4th ed. 1842, translated by J. E. Ryland,
   Edinburgh, 1842, and again by E. G. Robinson, N. York, 1865), Memorials
   of Christian Life (1823, 3d ed. 1845, 3 vols.), the Gnostic Heresies
   (1818), and biographies of representative characters, as Julian the
   Apostate (1812), St. Bernard (1813, 2d ed. 1848), St. Chrysostom (1822,
   3d ed. 1848), and Tertullian (1825, 2d ed. 1849). His History a
   Christian Doctrines was published after his death by Jacobi (1855), and
   translated by J. E. Ryland (Lond., 1858). [28]

   From J. C. L. Gieseler (Professor of Church History in Göttingen, d.
   1854), a profoundly learned, acute, calm, impartial, conscientious, but
   cold and dry scholar, we have a Textbook of Church Historyfrom the
   birth of Christ to 1854. [29] He takes Tillemont's method of giving the
   history in the very words of the sources; only he does not form the
   text from them, but throws them into notes. The chief excellence of
   this invaluable and indispensable work is in its very carefully
   selected and critically elucidated extracts from the original
   authorities down to the year 1648 (as far as he edited the work
   himself). The skeleton-like text presents, indeed, the leading facts
   clearly and concisely, but does not reach the inward life and spiritual
   marrow of the church of Christ. The theological views of Gieseler
   hardly rise above the jejune rationalism of Wegscheider, to whom he
   dedicated a portion of his history; and with all his attempt at
   impartiality he cannot altogether conceal the negative effect of a
   rationalistic conception of Christianity, which acts like a chill upon
   the narrative of its history, and substitutes a skeleton of dry bones
   for a living organism.

   Neander and Gieseler matured their works in respectful and friendly
   rivalry, during the same period of thirty years of slow, but solid and
   steady growth. The former is perfectly subjective, and reproduces the
   original sources in a continuous warm and sympathetic composition,
   which reflects at the same time the author's own mind and heart; the
   latter is purely objective, and speaks with the indifference of an
   outside spectator, through the ipsissima verbaof the same sources,
   arranged as notes, and strung together simply by a slender thread of
   narrative. The one gives the history ready-made, and full of life and
   instruction; the other furnishes the material and leaves the reader to
   animate and improve it for himself. With the one, the text is
   everything; with the other, the notes. But both admirably complete each
   other, and exhibit together the ripest fruit of German scholarship in
   general church history in the first half of the nineteenth century.

   Ferdinand Christian Baur (Prof. of Church History in Tübingen, d. 1860)
   must be named alongside with Neander and Gieseler in the front rank of
   German church historians. He was equal to both in independent and
   thorough scholarship, superior in constructive criticism and
   philosophical generalization, but inferior in well-balanced judgment
   and solid merit. He over-estimated theories and tendencies, and
   undervalued persons and facts. He was an indefatigable investigator and
   bold innovator. He completely revolutionized the history of apostolic
   and post-apostolic Christianity, and resolved its rich spiritual life
   of faith and love into a purely speculative process of conflicting
   tendencies, which started from an antagonism of Petrinism and
   Paulinism, and were ultimately reconciled in the compromise of ancient
   Catholicism. He fully brought to light, by a keen critical analysis,
   the profound intellectual fermentation of the primitive church, but
   eliminated from it the supernatural and miraculous element; yet as an
   honest and serious sceptic he had to confess at last a psychological
   miracle in the conversion of St. Paul, and to bow before the greater
   miracle of the resurrection of Christ, without which the former is an
   inexplicable enigma. His critical researches and speculations gave a
   powerful stimulus to a reconsideration and modification of the
   traditional views on early Christianity.

   We have from his fertile pen a general History of the Christian Church,
   in five volumes (1853-1863), three of which were, published after his
   death and lack the originality and careful finish of the first and
   second, which cover the first six centuries;Lectures on Christian
   Doctrine History (Dogmengeschichte), published by his son (1865-'67, in
   3 volumes), and a briefLehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, edited by himself
   (1847, 2d ed. 1858). Even more valuable are his monographs: on St.
   Paul, for whom he had a profound veneration, although he recognized
   only four of his Epistles as genuine (1845, 2d ed. by E. Zeller, 1867,
   2 vols., translated into English, 1875); on Gnosticism, with which he
   had a strong spiritual affinity (Die christliche Gnosis oder die
   christliche Religionsphilosophie, 1835); the history of the Doctrine of
   the Atonement (1838, 1 vol.), and of the Trinity and Incarnation
   (1841-'43, in 3 vols.), and his masterly vindication of Protestantism
   against Möhler's Symbolik (2d ed. 1836). [30]

   Karl Rudolph Hagenbach (Professor of Church History at Basel, d. 1874)
   wrote, in the mild and impartial spirit of Neander, with poetic taste
   and good judgment, and in pleasing popular style, a general History of
   the Christian Church in seven volumes (4th ed. 1868-'72), [31] and a
   History of Christian Doctrines, in two volumes (1841, 4th ed. 1857).
   [32]

   Protestant Germany is richer than any other country in, manuals and
   compends of church history for the use of students. We mention
   Engelhardt (1834), Niedner (Geschichte der christl. Kirche, 1846, and
   Lehrbuch, 1866), Hase (11th ed. 1886), Guericke (9th ed. 1866, 3
   vols.), Lindner (1848-'54), Jacobi (1850, unfinished), Fricke (1850),
   Kurtz (Lehrbuch, 10th ed. 1887, in 2 vols., the larger Handbuch,
   unfinished), Hasse (edited by Köhler, 1864, in 3 small vols.), Köllner
   (1864), Ebrard (1866) 2 vols.), Rothe (lectures edited by Weingarten,
   1875, 2 vols.), Herzog (1876-'82, 3 vols.), H. Schmid (1881, 2 vols.).
   Niedner's Lehrbuch (1866) stands first for independent and thorough
   scholarship, but is heavy. Hase's Compend is unsurpassed for
   condensation, wit, point, and artistic taste, as a miniature picture.
   [33] Herzog's Abriss keeps the medium between voluminous fulness and
   enigmatic brevity, and is written in a candid Christian spirit. Kurtz
   is clear, concise, and evangelical. [34] A new manual was begun by
   Möller, 1889.

   The best works on doctrine history (Dogmengeschichte) are by Münscher,
   Geiseler, Neander, Baur, Hagenbach, Thomasius, H. Schmid, Nitzsch, and
   Harnack (1887).

   It is impossible to do justice here to the immense service which
   Protestant Germany has done to special departments of church history.
   Most of the fathers, popes, schoolmen and reformers, and the principal
   doctrines of Christianity have been made the subject of minute and
   exhaustive historical treatment. We have already mentioned the
   monographs of Neander and Baur, and fully equal to them are such
   masterly and enduring works as Rothe's Beginnings of the Christian
   Church, Ullmann's Reformers before the Reformation, Hasse's Anselm of
   Canterbury, and Dorner's History of Christology.

   (b) French works.

   Dr. Etienne L. Chastel (Professor of Church History in the National
   Church at Geneva, d. 1886) wrote a complete Histoire du
   Christianisme(Paris, 1881-'85, 5 vols.).

   Dr. Merle D'aubigné (Professor of Church History in the independent
   Reformed Seminary at Geneva, d. 1872) reproduced in elegant and
   eloquent French an extensive history both of the Lutheran and
   Calvinistic Reformation, with an evangelical enthusiasm and a dramatic
   vivacity which secured it an extraordinary circulation in England and
   America (far greater, than on the Continent), and made it the most
   popular work on that important period. Its value as a history is
   somewhat diminished by polemical bias and the occasional want of
   accuracy. Dr. Merle conceived the idea of the work during the
   celebration of the third centenary of the German Reformation in 1817,
   in the Wartburg at Eisenach, where Luther translated, the New Testament
   and threw his inkstand at the devil. He labored on it till the year of
   his death. [35]

   Dr. Edmund De Pressensé (pastor of a free church in Paris, member of
   the National Assembly, then senator of France), and able scholar, with
   evangelical Protestant convictions similar to those of Dr. Merle, wrote
   a Life of Christ against Renan, and a History of Ancient Christianity,
   both of which are translated into English. [36]

   Ernest Renan, the celebrated Orientalist and member of the French
   Academy, prepared from the opposite standpoint of sceptical criticism,
   and mixing history with romance, but in brilliant, and fascinating
   style, the Life of Christ, and the history of the Beginnings of
   Christianity to the middle of the second century. [37]

   (c) English works.

   English literature is rich in works on Christian antiquity, English
   church history, and other special departments, but poor in general
   histories of Christianity.

   The first place among English historians, perhaps, is due to Edward
   Gibbon (d. 1794). In his monumental History of the Decline and Fall of
   the Roman Empire(finished after twenty years' labor, at Lausanne, June
   27,1787), he notices throughout the chief events in ecclesiastical
   history from the introduction of the Christian religion to the times of
   the crusades and the capture of Constantinople (1453), with an accurate
   knowledge of the chief sources and the consummate skill of a master in
   the art of composition, with occasional admiration for heroic
   characters like Athanasius and Chrysostom, but with a keener eye to the
   failings of Christians and the imperfections of the visible church, and
   unfortunately without sympathy and understanding of the spirit of
   Christianity which runs like a golden thread even through the darkest
   centuries. He conceived the idea of his magnificent work in papal Rome,
   among the ruins of the Capitol, and in tracing the gradual decline and
   fall of imperial Rome, which he calls "the greatest, perhaps, and most
   awful scene in the history of mankind," he has involuntarily become a
   witness to the gradual growth and triumph of the religion of the cross,
   of which no historian of the future will ever record a history of
   decline and fall, though some "lonely traveller from New Zealand,"
   taking his stand on "a broken arch" of the bridge of St. Angelo, may
   sketch the ruins of St. Peter's. [38]

   Joseph Milner (Vicar of Hull, d. 1797) wrote a History of the Church of
   Christfor popular edification, selecting those portions which best
   suited his standard of evangelical orthodoxy and piety. "Nothing," he
   says in the preface, "but what appears to me to belong to Christ's
   kingdom shall be admitted; genuine piety is the only thing I intend to
   celebrate. He may be called the English Arnold, less learned, but free
   from polemics and far more readable and useful than the German pietist.
   His work was corrected and continued by his brother,Isaac Milner (d.
   1820), by Thomas Granthamand Dr. Stebbing. [39]

   Dr. Waddington (Dean of Durham) prepared three volumes on the history
   of the Church before the Reformation (1835) and three volumes on the
   Continental Reformation (1841). Evangelical.

   Canon James C. Robertson of Canterbury (Prof. of Church History in
   King's College, d. 1882) brings his History of the Christian Churchfrom
   the Apostolic Age down to the Reformation (a.d. 64-1517). The work was
   first published in four octavo volumes (1854 sqq.) and then in eight
   duodecimo volumes (Lond. 1874), and is the best, as it is the latest,
   general church history written by an Episcopalian. It deserves praise
   for its candor, moderation, and careful indication of authorities.

   From Charles Hardwick (Archdeacon of Ely, d. 1859) we have a useful
   manual of the Church History of the Middle Age (1853, 3d ed. by Prof.
   W. Stubbs, 1872), and another on the Reformation (1856, 3d ed. by W.
   Stubbs, London, 1873). His History of the Anglican Articles of Religion
   (1859) is a valuable contribution to English church history.

   Dr. Trench, Archbishop of Dublin, has published his Lectures on
   Mediaeval Church History (Lond. 1877), delivered before the girls of
   Queen's College, London. They are conceived in a spirit of devout
   churchly piety and interspersed with judicious reflections.

   Philip Smith's History of the Christian Church during the First Ten
   Centuries (1879), and during the Middle Ages (1885), in 2 vols., is a
   skilful and useful manual for students. [40]

   The most popular and successful modern church historians in the English
   or any other language are Dean Milman of St. Paul's, Dean Stanley of
   Westminster Abbey, and Archdeacon Farrar of Westminster. They belong to
   the broad church school of the Church of England, are familiar with
   Continental learning, and adorn their chosen themes with all the charms
   of elegant, eloquent, and picturesque diction. Henry Hart Milman (d.
   1868) describes, with the stately march of Gibbon and as a counterpart
   of his decline and fall of Paganism, the rise and progress of Ancient
   and Latin Christianity, with special reference to its bearing on the
   progress of civilization. [41] Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (d. 1881) unrolls
   a picture gallery of great men and events in the Jewish theocracy, from
   Abraham to the Christian era, and in the Greek church, from Constantine
   the Great to Peter the Great. [42] Frederic W. Farrar (b. 1831)
   illuminates with classical and rabbinical learning, and with exuberant
   rhetoric the Life of Christ, and of the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
   and the Early Days of Christianity. [43]

   (d) American works.

   American literature is still in its early youth, but rapidly growing in
   every department of knowledge. Prescott, Washington Irving, Motley, and
   Bancroft have cultivated interesting portions of the history of Spain,
   Holland, and the United States, and have taken rank among the classical
   historians in the English language.

   In ecclesiastical history the Americans have naturally so far been
   mostly in the attitude of learners and translators, but with every
   prospect of becoming producers. They have, as already noticed,
   furnished the best translations of Mosheim, Neander, and Gieseler.

   Henry B. Smith (late Professor in the Union Theol. Seminary, New York,
   d. 1877) has prepared the best Chronological Tables of Church History,
   which present in parallel columns a synopsis of the external and
   internal history of Christianity, including that of America, down to
   1858, with lists of Councils, Popes, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops,
   and Moderators of General Assemblies. [44]

   W. G. T. Shedd (Professor in the same institution, b. 1820) wrote from
   the standpoint of Calvinistic orthodoxy an eminently readable History
   of Christian Doctrine (N. York, 1863, 2 vols.), in clear, fresh, and
   vigorous English, dwelling chiefly on theology, anthropology, and
   soteriology, and briefly touching on eschatology, but entirely omitting
   the doctrine of the Church and the sacraments, with the connected
   controversies.

   Philip Schaff is the author of a special History of the Apostolic
   Church, in English and German (N. York, 1853, etc., and Leipzig, 1854),
   of a History of the Creeds of Christendom (N. York, 4th ed., 1884, 3
   vols., with documents original and translated), and of a generalHistory
   of the Christian Church (N. York and Edinb., 1859-'67, in 3 vols.; also
   in German, Leipzig, 1867; rewritten and enlarged, N. Y. and Edinb.,
   1882-'88; third revision, 1889, 5 vols.; to be continued).

   George P. Fisher (Professor in New Haven, b. 1827) has written the best
   manual in the English language: History of the Christian Church with
   Maps. N. York, 1887. He has also published a History of the Reformation
   (1873); Beginnings of Christianity (1877), andOutlines of Universal
   History (1885),--all in a calm, amiable, and judicious spirit, and a
   clear, chaste style.

   Contributions to interesting chapters in the history of Protestantism
   are numerous. Dr. E. H. Gillett (d. 1875) wrote a Monograph on John Hus
   (N. York, 1864, 2 vols.), aHistory of the Presbyterian Church in the
   United States of America (Philad. 1864, 2 vols.), and a History of
   Natural Theology (God in Human Thought, N. York, 1874, 2 vols.); Dr.
   Abel Stevens, a History of Methodism, viewed as the great religious
   revival of the eighteenth century, down to the centenary celebration of
   1839 (N. York, 1858-'61, 3 vols.), and a History of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church in the United States (1864-'67, 4 vols.); Henry M.
   Baird, a History of the Rise and Progress of the Huguenots in France
   (N. York, 1879, 2 vols.), andThe Huguenots and Henry of Navarre (1886,
   2 vols.).

   The denominational and sectarian divisions of American Christianity
   seem to be unfavorable to the study and cultivation of general church
   history, which requires a large-hearted catholic spirit. But, on the
   other hand, the social and national intermingling of ecclesiastical
   organizations of every variety of doctrine and discipline, on a basis
   of perfect freedom and equality before the law, widens the horizon, and
   facilitates comparison and appreciation of variety in unity and unity
   in variety; while the growth and prosperity of the churches on the
   principle of self-support and self-government encourages a hopeful view
   of the future. America falls heir to the whole wealth of European
   Christianity and civilization, and is in a favorable position to review
   and reproduce in due time the entire course of Christ's kingdom in the
   old world with the faith and freedom of the new. [45]

   (e) Finally, we must mention biblical and ecclesiastical Encyclopaedias
   which contain a large number of valuable contributions to church
   history from leading scholars of the age, viz.:

   1. The Bible Dictionariesof Winer. (Leipzig, 1820, 3d ed. 1847, 2
   vols.); Schenkel (Leipzig, 1869-'75, 5 vols.); Riehm Kitto (Edinb.,
   1845, third revised ed. by W. L. Alexander, 1862-'65, 3 vols.); Wm.
   Smith (London, 1860-'64, in 3 vols., American edition much enlarged and
   improved by H. Hackett and E. Abbot, N. York, 1870, in 4 vols.); Ph.
   Schaff (Philadelphia, 1880, with maps and illustrations; 4th ed.,
   revised, 1887).

   2. The Biblical and Historical Dictionariesof Herzog (Real-Encyklopädie
   für Protestantische Theologie und Kirche, Gotha 1854 to 1868, in 22
   vols., new ed. thoroughly revised by Herzog, Plitt and Hauck, Leipzig,
   1877-'88, in 18 vols.), Schaff-Herzog (Religious Encyclopaedia, based
   on Herzog but condensed, supplemented, and adapted to English and
   American students, edited by Philip Schaff in connection with Samuel M.
   Jackson and D. S. Schaff, N. York and Edinburgh, revised ed., 1887, in
   3 vols., with a supplementary vol. on Living Divines and Christian
   Workers, 1887); Wetzer and Welte (Roman Catholic Kirchenlexicon,
   Freiburg i. Breisgau, 1847-l860, in 12 vols.; second ed. newly
   elaborated by Cardinal Joseph Hergenröther and Dr. Franz Kaulen, 1880
   sqq., promised in 10 vols.); Lichtenberger. (Encyclopédie des sciences
   religieuses, Paris, 1877-'82, in 13 vols., with supplement); Mcclintock
   and Strong (Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical
   Literature, New York, 1867-'81, 10 vols. and two supplementary volumes,
   1885 and 1887, largely illustrated). The Encyclopaedia Britannica (9th
   ed., completed 1889 in 25 vols.) contains also many elaborate articles
   on biblical and ecclesiastical topics.

   3. For ancient church history down to the age of Charlemagne: Smith and
   Cheetham, Dictionary of Christian Antiquities (London and Boston, 1875,
   2 vols.); Smith and Wace, Dictionary of Christian Biography,
   Literature, Sects and Doctrines during the first eight centuries
   (London and Boston, 1877-'87, 4 vols.). The articles in these two works
   are written mostly by scholars of the Church of England, and are very
   valuable for fulness and accuracy of information.

   Note.--The study of church history is reviving in the Greek Church
   where it began. Philaret Bapheidos has issued a compendious church
   history under the title: Ekklesiastike istoria apo tou kuriou hemon
   Iesou Christou mechri ton kath' hemas chronon hupo Philaretou
   Bapseidou, archimandritou D. Ph. kai kathegetou tes Theologias en te en
   Chalke Theologike Schole. Tomos protos. Archaia ekkles; historia. a.d.
   1-700. En Konstantinopolei , 1884 (Lorentz & Keil, libraries de S. M.
   I. le Sultan), 380 pp. The second vol. embraces the mediaeval church to
   the fall of Constantinople, 1453, and has 459 pp. The work is dedicated
   to Dr. Philotheos Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicomedia, the discoverer
   of the famous Jerusalem Codex. Nearly all the literature quoted is
   German Protestant; no English, very few Latin, and still fewer Greek
   works are mentioned. Another compend of Church History in Greek by
   Diomedes Kyriakos appeared at Athens, 1881, in 2 vols.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] 6 These Greek historians have been best edited by Henri de Valois
   (Valesius), in Greek and Latin with notes, in 3 folios, Paris, 1659-73;
   also Amsterd., 1695, and, with additional notes by W. Reading,
   Cambridge, 1720. Eusebius has been often separately published in
   several languages.

   [8] Nikephorou Kallistou tou Xanthopoulou Ekklesiastikes his torias
   Biblia ie. Edited by the Jesuit, Fronton le Duc (Fronto-Ducaeus), Par.
   1630, 2 fol. This is the only Greek edition from the only extant MS.,
   which belonged to the King of Hungary, then came into the possession of
   the Turks, and last into the imperial library of Vienna. But a Latin
   version by John Lang waspublished at Basle as early as 1561.

   [9] We omit the inferior continuations of the Polish Dominican, Abr.
   Bzovius, from 1198 to 1565, in 8 vols., and of Henr. Spondé, bishop of
   Pamiers, from 1197 to 1647, 2 vols. The best of the older editions,
   including the continuation of Raynaldi (but not of Laderchi) and the
   learned criticisms of Pagi and his nephew, was arranged by Archbishop
   Mansi, in 88 folios, Lucca, 1738-57. A hundred years later, a German
   scholar in Rome, Augustin Theiner, prefect of the Vatican Archives,
   resumed the continuation in 3 vols., embracing the pontificate of
   Gregory XIII. (a.d. 1572-'84), Rome and Paris, 1856, 3 vols fol, and
   hoped to bring the history down to the pontificate of Pius VII., a.d.
   1800, in 12 folios; but he interrupted the continuation, and began, in
   1864, a new edition of the whole work (including Raynaldi and
   Laderchi), which is to be completed in 45 or 50 volumes, at Bar-le-Duc,
   France. Theiner was first a liberal Catholic, then an Ultramontanist,
   last an Old Catholic (in correspondence with Döllinger), excluded from
   the Vatican (1870), but pardoned by the pope, and died suddenly, 1874.
   His older brother, Johann Anton, became a Protestant.

   [10] A portion of Fleury's History, from the second oecumenical Council
   to the end of the fourth century (a.d. 381-400), was published in
   English at Oxford, 1842, in three volumes, on the basis of Herbert's
   translation (London, 1728), carefully revised by John H Newman, who was
   at that time the theological leader of the Oxford Tractarian movement,
   and subsequently (1879) became a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church.

   1871 and 1876.

   [20] His Kirchengeschichte was published from his lectures by Pius
   Boniface Gams. Regensburg, 1867-'68, in 3 vols. It is very unequal and
   lacks the author's own finish. We have from Möhler also a monograph on
   Athanius (1827), and a Patrologie (covering the first three centuries,
   and published after his death, 1840).

   [21] Handbuch der Universal-Kirchengeschichte. 9th ed., Mainz, 1872, 2
   vols.; 10th ed., 1882. Alzog aims to be the Roman Catholic Hase as to
   brevity and condensation. A French translation from the 5th ed. was
   prepared by Goeschler and Audley, 1849 (4th ed. by Abbé Sabatier,
   1874); an English translation by F. J. Pabisch and Thos. Byrne,
   Cincinnati, O., 1874 sqq., in 3 vols. The Am. translators censure the
   French translators for the liberties they have taken with Alzog, but
   they have taken similar liberties, and, by sundry additions, made the
   author more Romish than he was.

   [22] English translation by Dr. Edw. Cox, Lond. 1840-'42, in 4 vols.
   This combines Döllinger's Handbuch and Lehrbuch as far as they
   supplement each other.

   vols. Murdock was Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Andover, Mass.
   (d. 1856), and translated also Münscher's Dogmengeschichte. Mosheim's
   special history of the ante-Nicene period (1733) was translated from
   the Latin by Vidal (1813), and Murdock (1851), new ed., N. York, 1853,
   2 vols.

   and the proof-reader), and the very name is rather abschreckend, but he
   is as valuable for reference as Baronius, and far more impartial.

   vols. for the Reformation in the time of Calvin. The last three vols.
   of the second series were translated and published after the author's

   [37] Vie de Jèsus. Paris, 1863, and in many editions in different

   Jesu of Strauss, but is very superficial and turns the gospel history
   into a novel with a self-contradictory and impossible hero. It forms
   the first volume of his Histoire des origines du christianisme. The
   other volumes are: 2. Les Apótres, Paris, 1866; 3. St. Paul, 1869; 4.
   L'Antechrist, 1873; 5. La évangiles et la, seconde génération des

   "without any other passion than a very keen curiosity."

   [38] Cardinal Newman, shortly before his transition from Oxford
   Tractarianism to Romanism (in his essay on Development of Christian
   Doctrine, 1845), declared "the infidel Gibbon to be the chief, perhaps
   the only English writer who has any claim to be considered an
   ecclesiastical historian." This is certainly not true any longer. Dr.
   McDonald, in an essay "Was Gibbon an infidel?" (in the "Bibliotheca
   Sacra" for July, 1868, Andover, Ham.), tried to vindicate him against
   the charge of infidelity. But Gibbon was undoubtedly a Deist and deeply
   affected by the skepticism of Hume and Voltaire. While a student at
   Oxford he was converted to Romanism by reading Bossuet's Variations of
   Protestantism, and afterwards passed over to infidelity, with scarcely
   a ray of hope of any immortality but that of fame, See his
   Autobiography, Ch. VIII., and his letter to Lord Sheffield of April 27,
   1793, where he says that his "only consolation" in view of death and
   the trials of life was "the presence of a friend." Best ed. of Gibbon,
   by W. Smith.

   transferred verbatim a large portion of his Manual from my church
   history, but with proper acknowledgment. Another church history by a
   writer nearer home has made even larger, but less honest use of my
   book.

   History of Latin Christianity to the Pontificate of Nicholas V. (a.d.
   1455), Lond. and N. York, 1854 sqq, in 8 vols. Milman wrote also a
   History of the Jews, 1829 (revised 1862, 3 vols.), and published an
   edition of Gibbon's Decline and Fall with useful annotations. A
   complete edition of his historical works appeared, Lond. 1866-'67, in
   15 vols. 8vo.

   [42] Lectures on the History of the Eastern Church (delivered in
   Oxford), Lond. and N. York, 1862. No complete history, but a series of
   picturesque descriptions of the most interesting characters and scenes
   in the Eastern church. Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church,
   Lond. and N. York, l862-'76, in 3 vols. An independent and skilful
   adaptation of the views and results of Ewald's Geschichte Israel's, to
   which Stanley pays a fine tribute in the Prefaces to the first and
   third vols. His Historical Memorials of Canterbury Cathedral (1855, 5th
   ed. 1869), and of Westminster Abbey (1867, 4th ed. 1874), are important
   for English church history. His Lectures on the History of the, Church
   of Scotland (1872) have delighted the moderate and liberal, but
   displeased the orthodox Presbyterians of the land of Knox and Walter
   Scott.

   § 8. Central Position of Christ in the History of the World.

   To see clearly the relation of the Christian religion to the preceding
   history of mankind, and to appreciate its vast influence upon all
   future ages, we must first glance at the preparation which existed in
   the political, moral, and religious condition of the world for the
   advent of our Saviour.

   As religion is the deepest and holiest concern of man, the entrance of
   the Christian religion into history is the most momentous of all
   events. It is the end of the old world and the beginning of the new. It
   was a great idea of Dionysius "the Little" to date our era from the
   birth of our Saviour. Jesus Christ, the God-Man, the prophet, priest,
   and king of mankind, is, in fact, the centre and turning-point not only
   of chronology, but of all history, and the key to all its mysteries.
   Around him, as the sun of the moral universe, revolve at their several
   distances, all nations and all important events, in the religious life
   of the world; and all must, directly or indirectly, consciously or
   unconsciously, contribute to glorify his name and advance his cause.
   The history of mankind before his birth must be viewed as a preparation
   for his coming, and the history after his birth as a gradual diffusion
   of his spirit and progress of his kingdom. "All things were created by
   him, and for him." He is "the desire of all nations." He appeared in
   the "fulness of time," [46] when the process of preparation was
   finished, and the world's need of redemption fully disclosed.

   This preparation for Christianity began properly with the very creation
   of man, who was made in the image of God, and destined for communion
   with him through the eternal Son; and with the promise of salvation
   which God gave to our first parents as a star of hope to guide them
   through the darkness of sin and error. [47] Vague memories of a
   primitive paradise and subsequent fall, and hopes of a future
   redemption, survive even in the heathen religions.

   With Abraham, about nineteen hundred years before Christ, the religious
   development of humanity separates into the two independent, and, in
   their compass, very unequal branches of Judaism and heathenism. These
   meet and unite--at last in Christ as the common Saviour, the fulfiller
   of the types and prophecies, desires and hopes of the ancient world;
   while at the same time the ungodly elements of both league in deadly
   hostility against him, and thus draw forth the full revelation of his
   all--conquering power of truth and love.

   As Christianity is the reconciliation and union of God and man in and
   through Jesus Christ, the God-Man, it must have been preceded by a
   twofold process of preparation, an approach of God to man, and an
   approach of man to God. In Judaism the preparation is direct and
   positive, proceeding from above downwards, and ending with the birth of
   the Messiah. In heathenism it is indirect and mainly, though not
   entirely, negative, proceeding from below upwards, and ending with a
   helpless cry of mankind for redemption. There we have a special
   revelation or self-communication of the only true God by word and deed,
   ever growing clearer and plainer, till at last the divine Logos appears
   in human nature, to raise it to communion with himself; here men,
   guided indeed by the general providence of God, and lighted by the
   glimmer of the Logos shining in the darkness, [48] yet unaided by
   direct revelation, and left to "walk in their own ways," [49] "that
   they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him, and find
   him." [50] In Judaism the true religion is prepared for man; in
   heathenism man is prepared for the true religion. There the divine
   substance is begotten; here the human forms are moulded to receive it.
   The former is like the elder son in the parable, who abode in his
   father's house; the latter like the prodigal, who squandered his
   portion, yet at last shuddered before the gaping abyss of perdition,
   and penitently returned to the bosom of his father's compassionate
   love. [51] Heathenism is the starry night, full of darkness and fear,
   but of mysterious presage also, and of anxious waiting for the light of
   day; Judaism, the dawn, full of the fresh hope and promise of the
   rising sun; both lose themselves in the sunlight of Christianity, and
   attest its claim to be the only true and the perfect religion for
   mankind.

   The heathen preparation again was partly intellectual and literary,
   partly political and social. The former is represented by the Greeks,
   the latter by the Romans.

   Jerusalem, the holy city, Athens, the city of culture, and Rome, the
   city of power, may stand for the three factors in that preparatory
   history which ended in the birth of Christianity.

   This process of preparation for redemption in the history of the world,
   the groping of heathenism after the "unknown God" [52] and inward
   peace, and the legal struggle and comforting hope of Judaism, repeat
   themselves in every individual believer; for man is made for Christ,
   and "his heart is restless, till it rests in Christ." [53]

   "Salvation is of the Jews." [54] This wonderful people, whose fit
   symbol is the burning bush, was chosen by sovereign grace to stand
   amidst the surrounding idolatry as the bearer of the knowledge of the
   only true God, his holy law, and cheering promise, and thus to become
   the cradle of the Messiah. It arose with the calling of Abraham, and
   the covenant of Jehovah with him in Canaan, the land of promise; grew
   to a nation in Egypt, the land of bondage; was delivered and organized
   into a theocratic state on the basis of the law of Sinai by Moses in
   the wilderness; was led back into Palestine by Joshua; became, after
   the Judges, a monarchy, reaching the height of its glory in David and
   Solomon; split into two hostile kingdoms, and, in punishment for
   internal discord and growing apostasy to idolatry, was carried captive
   by heathen conquerors; was restored after seventy years' humiliation to
   the land of its fathers, but fell again under the yoke of heathen foes;
   yet in its deepest abasement fulfilled its highest mission by giving
   birth to the Saviour of the world. "The history of the Hebrew people,"
   says Ewald, "is, at the foundation, the history of the true religion
   growing through all the stages of progress unto its consummation; the
   religion which, on its narrow national territory, advances through all
   struggles to the highest victory, and at length reveals itself in its
   full glory and might, to the end that, spreading abroad by its own
   irresistible energy, it may never vanish away, but may become the
   eternal heritage and blessing of all nations. The whole ancient world
   had for its object to seek the true religion; but this people alone
   finds its being and honor on earth exclusively in the true religion,
   and thus it enters upon the stage of history." [55]

   Judaism, in sharp contrast with the idolatrous nations of antiquity,
   was like an oasis in a desert, clearly defined and isolated; separated
   and enclosed by a rigid moral and ceremonial law. The holy land itself,
   though in the midst of the three Continents of the ancient world, and
   surrounded by the great nations of ancient culture, was separated from
   them by deserts south and east, by sea on the west, and by mountain on
   the north; thus securing to the Mosaic religion freedom to unfold
   itself and to fulfil its great work without disturbing influenced from
   abroad. But Israel carried in its bosom from the first the large
   promise, that in Abraham's seed all the nations of the earth should be
   blessed. Abraham, the father of the faithful, Moses, the lawgiver,
   David, the heroic king and sacred psalmist, Isaiah, the evangelist
   among the prophets, Elijah the Tishbite, who reappeared with Moses on
   the Mount of Transfiguration to do homage to Jesus, and John the
   Baptist, the impersonation of the whole Old Testament, are the most
   conspicuous links in the golden chain of the ancient revelation.

   The outward circumstances and the moral and religious condition of the
   Jews at the birth of Christ would indeed seem at first and on the whole
   to be in glaring contradiction with their divine destiny. But, in the
   first place, their very degeneracy proved the need of divine help. In
   the second place, the redemption through Christ appeared by contrast in
   the greater glory, as a creative act of God. And finally, amidst the
   mass of corruption, as a preventive of putrefaction, lived the
   succession of the true children of Abraham, longing for the salvation
   of Israel, and ready to embrace Jesus of Nazareth as the promised
   Messiah and Saviour of the world.

   Since the conquest of Jerusalem by Pompey, b.c. 63 (the year made
   memorable by the consulship of Cicero. the conspiracy of Catiline, and
   the birth of Caesar Augustus), the Jews had been subject to the heathen
   Romans, who heartlessly governed them by the Idumean Herod and his
   sons, and afterwards by procurators. Under this hated yoke their
   Messianic hopes were powerfully raised, but carnally distorted. They
   longed chiefly for a political deliverer, who should restore the
   temporal dominion of David on a still more splendid scale; and they
   were offended with the servant form of Jesus, and with his spiritual
   kingdom. Their morals were outwardly far better than those of the
   heathen; but under the garb of strict obedience to their law, they
   concealed great corruption. They are pictured in the New Testament as a
   stiff-necked, ungrateful, and impenitent race, the seed of the serpent,
   a generation of vipers. Their own priest and historian, Josephus, who
   generally endeavored to present his countrymen to the Greeks and Romans
   in the most favorable light, describes them as at that time a debased
   and wicked people, well deserving their fearful punishment in the
   destruction of Jerusalem.

   As to religion, the Jews, especially after the Babylonish captivity,
   adhered most tenaciously to the letter of the law, and to their
   traditions and ceremonies, but without knowing the spirit and power of
   the Scriptures. They cherished a bigoted horror of the heathen, and
   were therefore despised and hated by them as misanthropic, though by
   their judgment, industry, and tact, they were able to gain wealth and
   consideration in all the larger cities of the Roman empire.

   After the time of the Maccabees (b.c. 150), they fell into three
   mutually hostile sects or parties, which respectively represent the
   three tendencies of formalism, skepticism, and mysticism; all
   indicating the approaching dissolution of the old religion and the dawn
   of the new. We may compare them to the three prevailing schools of
   Greek philosophy--the Stoic, the Epicurean, and the Platonic, and also
   to the three sects of Mohammedanism--the Sunnis, who are
   traditionalists, the Sheas, who adhere to the Koran, and the Sufis or
   mystics, who seek true religion in "internal divine sensation."

   1. The Pharisees, the "separate," [56] were, so to speak, the Jewish
   Stoics. They represented the traditional orthodoxy and stiff formalism,
   the legal self-righteousness and the fanatical bigotry of Judaism. They
   had most influence with the people and the women, and controlled the
   public worship. They confounded piety with theoretical orthodoxy. They
   overloaded the holy Scriptures with the traditions of the elders so as
   to make the Scriptures "of none effect." They analyzed the Mosaic law
   to death, and substituted a labyrinth of casuistry for a living code.
   "They laid heavy burdens and grievous to be borne on men's shoulders,"
   and yet they themselves would "not move them with their fingers." In
   the New Testament they bear particularly the reproach of hypocrisy;
   with, of course, illustrious exceptions, like Nicodemus, Gamaliel, and
   his disciple, Paul.

   2. The less numerous Sadducees [57] were skeptical, rationalistic, and
   worldly-minded, and held about the same position in Judaism as the
   Epicureans and the followers of the New Academy in Greek and Roman
   heathendom. They accepted the written Scriptures (especially the
   Pentateuch), but rejected the oral traditions, denied the resurrection
   of the body and the immortality of the soul, the existence of angels
   and spirits, and the doctrine of an all-ruling providence. They
   numbered their followers among the rich, and had for some time
   possession of the office of the high-priest. Caiaphas belonged to their
   party.

   The difference between the Pharisees and Sadducees reappears among
   modern Jews, who are divided into the orthodox and the liberal or
   rationalistic parties.

   3. The Essenes (whom we know only from Philo and Josephus) were not a
   party, but a mystic and ascetic order or brotherhood, and lived mostly
   in monkish seclusion in villages and in the desert Engedi on the Dead
   Sea. [58] They numbered about 4,000 members. With an arbitrary,
   allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament, they combined some
   foreign theosophic elements, which strongly resemble the tenets of the
   new Pythagorean and Platonic schools, but were probably derived (like
   the Gnostic and Manichaean theories) from eastern religions, especially
   from Parsism. They practised communion of goods, wore white garments,
   rejected animal food, bloody sacrifices, oaths, slavery, and (with few
   exceptions) marriage, and lived in the utmost simplicity, hoping
   thereby to attain a higher degree of holiness. They were the
   forerunners of Christian monasticism.

   The sect of the Essenes came seldom or never into contact with
   Christianity under the Apostles, except in the shape of a heresy at
   Colossae. But the Pharisees and Sadducees, particularly the former,
   meet us everywhere in the Gospels as bitter enemies of Jesus, and
   hostile as they are to each other, unite in condemning him to that
   death of the cross, which ended in the glorious resurrection, and
   became the foundation of spiritual life to believing Gentiles as well
   as Jews.

   [58] The name is variously written (Essenoi, Essaioi, Ossaioi) and
   derived from proper names, or from the Greek, or from the Hebrew and
   Aramaic The most plausible derivations are from dysh, hosios, holy;
   from 'yv', physician (comp. the corresponding term of Philo,
   therapeutes, which, however, means worshipper, devotee); from 'yzch,
   seer; from the rabbinical vzch, watchman, keeper (Ewald, formerly);
   from chsh', to be silent (Jost, Lightfoot); from the Syriac chasi or
   chasyo, pious, which is of the same root with the Hebrew chasid,
   chasidim (De Sacy, Ewald, IV. 484, 3rd., and Hitzig). See Schürer, N.

   Essenes and the Colossian heresy, in Com. on Coloss. (1875), pp. 73,

   Christianity from Essenic sources.

   § 10. The Law, and the Prophecy.

   Degenerate and corrupt though the mass of Judaism was, yet the Old
   Testament economy was the divine institution preparatory to the
   Christian redemption, and as such received deepest reverence from
   Christ and his apostles, while they sought by terrible rebuke to lead
   its unworthy representatives to repentance. It therefore could not fail
   of its saving effect on those hearts which yielded to its discipline,
   and conscientiously searched the Scriptures of Moses and the prophets.

   Law and prophecy are the two great elements of the Jewish religion, and
   make it a direct divine introduction to Christianity, "the voice of him
   that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make
   straight in the desert a highway for our God."

   1. The law of Moses was the clearest expression of the holy will of God
   before the advent of Christ. The Decalogue is a marvel of ancient
   legislation, and in its two tables enjoins the sum and substance of all
   true piety and morality--supreme love to God, and love to our neighbor.
   It set forth the ideal of righteousness, and was thus fitted most
   effectually to awaken the sense of man's great departure from it, the
   knowledge of sin and guilt. [59] 8 It acted as a schoolmaster to lead
   men to Christ [60] that they might be justified by faith." [61]

   The same sense of guilt and of the need of reconciliation was
   constantly kept alive by daily sacrifices, at first in the tabernacle
   and afterwards in the temple, and by the whole ceremonial law, which,
   as a wonderful system of types and shadows, perpetually pointed to the
   realities of the new covenant, especially to the one all-sufficient
   atoning sacrifice of Christ on the cross.

   God in his justice requires absolute obedience and purity of heart
   under promise of life and penalty of death. Yet he cannot cruelly sport
   with man; he is the truthful faithful, and merciful God. In the moral
   and ritual law, therefore, as in a shell, is hidden the sweet kernel of
   a promise, that he will one day exhibit the ideal of righteousness in
   living form, and give the penitent sinner pardon for all his
   transgressions and the power to fulfil the law. Without such assurance
   the law were bitter irony.

   As regards the law, the Jewish economy was a religion of repentance.

   2. But it was at the same time, as already, hinted, the vehicle of the
   divine promise of redemption, and, as such, a religion of hope. While
   the Greeks and Romans put their golden age in the past, the Jews looked
   for theirs in the future. Their whole history, their religious,
   political, and social institutions and customs pointed to the coming of
   the Messiah, and the establishment of his kingdom on earth.

   Prophecy, or the gospel under the covenant of the law, is really older
   than the law, which was added afterwards and came in between the
   promise and its fulfilment, between sin and redemption, between the
   disease and the cure. [62] Prophecy begins in paradise with the promise
   of the serpent-bruiser immediately after the fall. It predominates in
   the patriarchal age, especially in the life of Abraham, whose piety has
   the corresponding character of trust and faith; and Moses, the
   lawgiver, was at the same time a prophet pointing the people to a
   greater successor. [63] Without the comfort of the Messianic promise,
   the law must have driven the earnest soul to despair. From the time of
   Samuel, some eleven centuries before Christ, prophecy, hitherto
   sporadic, took an organized form in a permanent prophetical office and
   order. In this form it accompanied the Levitical priesthood and the
   Davidic dynasty down to the Babylonish captivity, survived this
   catastrophe, and directed the return of the people and the rebuilding
   of the temple; interpreting and applying the law, reproving abuses in
   church and state, predicting the terrible judgments and the redeeming
   grace of God, warning and punishing, comforting and encouraging, with
   an ever plainer reference to the coming Messiah, who should redeem
   Israel and the world from sin and misery, and establish a kingdom of
   peace and righteousness on earth.

   The victorious reign of David and the peaceful reign of Solomon
   furnish, for Isaiah and his successors, the historical and typical
   ground for a prophetic picture of a far more glorious future, which,
   unless thus attached to living memories and present circumstances,
   could not have been understood. The subsequent catastrophe and the
   sufferings of the captivity served to develop the idea of a Messiah
   atoning for the sins of the people and entering through suffering into
   glory.

   The prophetic was an extraordinary office, serving partly to complete,
   partly to correct the regular, hereditary priesthood, to prevent it
   from stiffening into monotonous formality, and keep it in living flow.
   The prophets were, so to speak, the Protestants of the ancient
   covenant, the ministers of the spirit and of immediate communion with
   God, in distinction from the ministers of the letter and of traditional
   and ceremonial mediation.

   The flourishing period of our canonical prophecy began with the eighth
   century before Christ, some seven centuries after Moses, when Israel
   was suffering under Assyrian oppression. In this period before the
   captivity, Isaiah ("the salvation of God"), who appeared in the last
   years of king Uzziah, about ten years before the founding of Rome, is
   the leading figure; and around him Micah, Joel, and Obadiah in the
   kingdom of Judah, and Hosea, Amos, and Jonah in the kingdom of Israel,
   are grouped. Isaiah reached the highest elevation of prophecy, and
   unfolds feature by feature a picture of the Messiah--springing from the
   house of David, preaching the glad tidings to the poor, healing the
   broken-hearted, opening the eyes to the blind, setting at liberty the
   captives, offering himself as a lamb to the slaughter, bearing the sins
   of the people, dying the just for the unjust, triumphing over death and
   ruling as king of peace over all nations--a picture which came to its
   complete fulfilment in one person, and one only, Jesus of Nazareth. He
   makes the nearest approach to the cross, and his book is the Gospel of
   the Old Testament. In the period of the Babylonian exile, Jeremiah
   (i.e. "the Lord casts down") stands chief. He is the prophet of sorrow,
   and yet of the new covenant of the Spirit. In his denunciations of
   priests and false prophets, his lamentations over Jerusalem, his holy
   grief, his bitter persecution he resembles the mission and life of
   Christ. He remained in the land of his fathers, and sang his
   lamentation on the ruins of Jerusalem; while Ezekiel warned the exiles
   on the river Chebar against false prophets and carnal hopes, urged them
   to repentance, and depicted the new Jerusalem and the revival of the
   dry bones of the people by the breath of God; and Daniel at the court
   of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon saw in the spirit the succession of the
   four empires and the final triumph of the eternal kingdom of the Son of
   Man. The prophets of the restoration are Haggai, Zechariah, and
   Malachi. With Malachi who lived to the time of Nehemiah, the Old
   Testament prophecy ceased, and Israel was left to himself four hundred
   years, to digest during this period of expectation the rich substance
   of that revelation, and to prepare the birth-place for the approaching
   redemption.

   3. Immediately before the advent of the Messiah the whole Old
   Testament, the law and the prophets, Moses and Isaiah together,
   reappeared for a short season embodied in John the Baptist, and then in
   unrivalled humility disappeared as the red dawn in the splendor of the
   rising sun of the new covenant. This remarkable man, earnestly
   preaching repentance in the wilderness and laying the axe at the root
   of the tree, and at the same time comforting with prophecy, and
   pointing to the atoning Lamb of God, was indeed, as the immediate
   forerunner of the New Testament economy, and the personal friend of the
   heavenly Bridegroom, the greatest of them that were born of woman; yet
   in his official character as the representative of the ancient
   preparatory economy he stands lower than the least in that kingdom of
   Christ, which is infinitely more glorious than all its types and
   shadows in the past.

   This is the Jewish religion, as it flowed from the fountain of divine
   revelation and lived in the true Israel, the spiritual children of
   Abraham, in John the Baptist, his parents and disciples, in the mother
   of Jesus, her kindred and friends, in the venerable Simeon, and the
   prophetess Anna, in Lazarus and his pious sisters, in the apostles and
   the first disciples, who embraced Jesus of Nazareth as the fulfiller of
   the law and the prophets, the Son of God and the Saviour of the world,
   and who were the first fruits of the Christian Church.

   Heathenism is religion in its wild growth on the soil of fallen human
   nature, a darkening of the original consciousness of God, a deification
   of the rational and irrational creature, and a corresponding corruption
   of the moral sense, giving the sanction of religion to natural and
   unnatural vices. [64]

   Even the religion of Greece, which, as an artistic product of the
   imagination, has been justly styled the religion of beauty, is deformed
   by this moral distortion. It utterly lacks the true conception of sin
   and consequently the true conception of holiness. It regards sin, not
   as a perverseness of will and an offence against the gods, but as a
   folly of the understanding and an offence against men, often even
   proceeding from the gods themselves; for "Infatuation," or Moral
   Blindness (Ate), is a "daughter of Jove," and a goddess, though cast
   from Olympus, and the source of all mischief upon earth. Homer knows no
   devil, but he put, a devilish element into his deities. The Greek gods,
   and also the Roman gods, who were copied from the former, are mere men
   and women, in whom Homer and the popular faith saw and worshipped the
   weaknesses and vices of the Grecian character, as well as its virtues,
   in magnified forms. The gods are born, but never die. They have bodies
   and senses, like mortals, only in colossal proportions. They eat and
   drink, though only nectar and ambrosia. They are awake and fall asleep.
   They travel, but with the swiftness of thought. They mingle in battle.
   They cohabit with human beings, producing heroes or demigods. They are
   limited to time and space. Though sometimes honored with the attributes
   of omnipotence and omniscience, and called holy and just, yet they are
   subject to an iron fate (Moira), fall under delusion, and reproach each
   other with folly and crime. Their heavenly happiness is disturbed by
   all the troubles of earthly life. Even Zeus or Jupiter, the patriarch
   of the Olympian family, is cheated by his sister and wife Hera (Juno),
   with whom he had lived three hundred years in secret marriage before he
   proclaimed her his consort and queen of the gods, and is kept in
   ignorance of the events before Troy. He threatens his fellows with
   blows and death, and makes Olympus tremble when he shakes his locks in
   anger. The gentle Aphrodite or Venus bleeds from a spear-wound on her
   finger. Mars is felled with a stone by Diomedes. Neptune and Apollo
   have to serve for hire and are cheated. Hephaestus limps and provokes
   an uproarious laughter. The gods are involved by their marriages in
   perpetual jealousies and quarrels. They are full of envy and wrath,
   hatred and lust prompt men to crime, and provoke each other to lying,
   and cruelty, perjury and adultery. The Iliad and Odyssey, the most
   popular poems of the Hellenic genius, are a chronique scandaleuse of
   the gods. Hence Plato banished them from his ideal Republic. Pindar,
   Aeschylus, and Sophocles also rose to loftier ideas of the gods and
   breathed a purer moral atmosphere; but they represented the exceptional
   creed of a few, while Homer expressed the popular belief. Truly we have
   no cause to long with Schiller for the return of the "gods of Greece,"
   but would rather join the poet in his joyful thanksgiving:


   "Einen zu bereichern unter allen,

   Musste diese Götterwelt vergehen."

   Notwithstanding this essential apostasy from truth and holiness,
   heathenism was religion, a groping after "the unknown God." By its
   superstition it betrayed the need of faith. Its polytheism rested on a
   dim monotheistic background; it subjected all the gods to Jupiter, and
   Jupiter himself to a mysterious fate. It had at bottom the feeling of
   dependence on higher powers and reverence for divine things. It
   preserved the memory of a golden age and of a fall. It had the voice of
   conscience, and a sense, obscure though it was, of guilt. It felt the
   need of reconciliation with deity, and sought that reconciliation by
   prayer, penance, and sacrifice. Many of its religious traditions and
   usages were faint echoes of the primal religion; and its mythological
   dreams of the mingling of the gods with men, of demigods, of Prometheus
   delivered by Hercules from his helpless sufferings, were unconscious
   prophecies and fleshly anticipations of Christian truths.

   This alone explains the great readiness with which heathens embraced
   the gospel, to the shame of the Jews. [65]

   There was a spiritual Israel scattered throughout the heathen world,
   that never received the circumcision of the flesh, but the unseen
   circumcision of the heart by the hand of that Spirit which bloweth
   where it listeth, and is not bound to any human laws and to ordinary
   means. The Old Testament furnishes several examples of true piety
   outside of the visible communion with the Jewish church, in the persons
   of Melchisedec, the friend of Abraham, the royal priest, the type of
   Christ; Jethro, the priest of Midian; Rahab, the Canaanite woman and
   hostess of Joshua and Caleb; Ruth, the Moabitess and ancestress of our
   Saviour; King Hiram, the friend of David; the queen of Sheba, who came
   to admire the wisdom of Solomon; Naaman the Syrian; and especially Job,
   the sublime sufferer, who rejoiced in the hope of his Redeemer. [66]

   The elements of truth, morality, and piety scattered throughout ancient
   heathenism, may be ascribed to three sources. In the first place, man,
   even in his fallen state, retains some traces of the divine image, a
   knowledge of God, [67] however weak, a moral sense or conscience, [68]
   and a longing for union with the Godhead, for truth and for
   righteousness. [69] In this view we may, with Tertullian, call the
   beautiful and true sentences of a Socrates, a Plato, an Aristotle, of
   Pindar, Sophocles, Cicero, Virgil, Seneca, Plutarch, "the testimonies
   of a soul constitutionally Christian," [70] of a nature predestined to
   Christianity. Secondly, some account must be made of traditions and
   recollections, however faint, coming down from the general primal
   revelations to Adam and Noah. But the third and most important source
   of the heathen anticipations of truth is the all-ruling providence of
   God, who has never left himself without a witness. Particularly must we
   consider, with the ancient Greek fathers, the influence of the divine
   Logos before his incarnation, [71] who was the tutor of mankind, the
   original light of reason, shining in the darkness and lighting every
   man, the sower scattering in the soil of heathendom the seeds of truth,
   beauty, and virtue. [72]

   The flower of paganism, with which we are concerned here, appears in
   the two great nations of classic antiquity, Greece and Rome. With the
   language, morality, literature, and religion of these nations, the
   apostles came directly into contact, and through the whole first age
   the church moves on the basis of these nationalities. These, together
   with the Jews, were the chosen nations of the ancient world, and shared
   the earth among them. The Jews were chosen for things eternal, to keep
   the sanctuary of the true religion. The Greeks prepared the elements of
   natural culture, of science and art, for the use of the church. The
   Romans developed the idea of law, and organized the civilized world in
   a universal empire, ready to serve the spiritual universality of the
   gospel. Both Greeks and Romans were unconscious servants of Jesus
   Christ, "the unknown God."

   These three nations, by nature at bitter enmity among themselves,
   joined hands in the superscription on the cross, where the holy name
   and the royal title of the Redeemer stood written, by the command of
   the heathen Pilate, "in Hebrew and Greek and Latin." [73]

   § 12. Grecian Literature, and the Roman Empire.

   The literature of the ancient Greeks and the universal empire of the
   Romans were, next to the Mosaic religion, the chief agents in preparing
   the world for Christianity. They furnished the human forms, in which
   the divine substance of the gospel, thoroughly prepared in the bosom of
   the Jewish theocracy, was moulded. They laid the natural foundation for
   the supernatural edifice of the kingdom of heaven. God endowed the
   Greeks and Romans with the richest natural gifts, that they might reach
   the highest civilization possible without the aid of Christianity, and
   thus both provide the instruments of human science, art, and law for
   the use of the church, and yet at the same time show the utter
   impotence of these alone to bless and save the world.

   The Greeks, few in number, like the Jews, but vastly more important in
   history than the numberless hordes of the Asiatic empires, were called
   to the noble task of bringing out, under a sunny sky and with a clear
   mind, the idea of humanity in its natural vigor and beauty, but also in
   its natural imperfection. They developed the principles of science and
   art. They liberated the mind from the dark powers of nature and the
   gloomy broodings of the eastern mysticism. They rose to the clear and
   free consciousness of manhood, boldly investigated the laws of nature
   and of spirit, and carried out the idea of beauty in all sorts of
   artistic forms. In poetry, sculpture, architecture, painting,
   philosophy, rhetoric, historiography, they left true masterpieces,
   which are to this day admired and studied as models of form and taste.

   All these works became truly valuable and useful only in the hands of
   the Christian church, to which they ultimately fell. Greece gave the
   apostles the most copious and beautiful language to express the divine
   truth of the Gospel, and Providence had long before so ordered
   political movements as to spread that language over the world and to
   make it the organ of civilization and international intercourse, as the
   Latin was in the middle ages, as the French was in the eighteenth
   century and as the English is coming to be in the nineteenth. "Greek,"
   says Cicero, "is read in almost all nations; Latin is confined by its
   own narrow boundaries." Greek schoolmasters and artists followed the
   conquering legions of Rome to Gaul and Spain. The youthful hero
   Alexander the Great, a Macedonian indeed by birth, yet an enthusiastic
   admirer of Homer, an emulator of Achilles, a disciple of the
   philosophic world-conqueror, Aristotle, and thus the truest Greek of
   his age, conceived the sublime thought of making Babylon the seat of a
   Grecian empire of the world; and though his empire fell to pieces at
   his untimely death, yet it had already carried Greek letters to the
   borders of India, and made them a common possession of all civilized
   nations. What Alexander had begun Julius Caesar completed. Under the
   protection of the Roman law the apostles could travel everywhere and
   make themselves understood through the Greek language in every city of
   the Roman domain.

   The Grecian philosophy, particularly the systems of Plato and
   Aristotle, formed the natural basis for scientific theology; Grecian
   eloquence, for sacred oratory; Grecian art, for that of the Christian
   church. Indeed, not a few ideas and maxims of the classics tread on the
   threshold of revelation and sound like prophecies of Christian truth;
   especially the spiritual soarings of Plato, [74] the deep religious
   reflections of Plutarch, [75] the sometimes almost Pauline moral
   precepts of Seneca. [76] To many of the greatest church fathers, Justin
   Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and in some measure even to
   Augustine, Greek philosophy was a bridge to the Christian faith, a
   scientific schoolmaster leading them to Christ. Nay, the whole ancient
   Greek church rose on the foundation of the Greek language and
   nationality, and is inexplicable without them.

   Here lies the real reason why the classical literature is to this day
   made the basis of liberal education throughout the Christian world.
   Youth are introduced to the elementary forms of science and art, to
   models of clear, tasteful style, and to self-made humanity at the
   summit of intellectual and artistic culture, and thus they are at the
   same time trained to the scientific apprehension of the Christian
   religion, which appeared when the development of Greek and Roman
   civilization had reached its culmination and began already to decay.
   The Greek and Latin languages, as the Sanskrit and Hebrew, died in
   their youth and were embalmed and preserved from decay in the immortal
   works of the classics. They still furnish the best scientific terms for
   every branch of learning and art and every new invention. The primitive
   records of Christianity have been protected against the uncertainties
   of interpretation incident upon the constant changes of a living
   language.

   But aside from the permanent value of the Grecian literature, the glory
   of its native land had, at the birth of Christ, already irrecoverably
   departed. Civil liberty and independence had been destroyed by internal
   discord and corruption. Philosophy had run down into skepticism and
   refined materialism. Art had been degraded to the service of levity and
   sensuality. Infidelity or superstition had supplanted sound religious
   sentiment. Dishonesty and licentiousness reigned among high and low.

   This hopeless state of things could not but impress the more earnest
   and noble souls with the emptiness of all science and art, and the
   utter insufficiency of this natural culture to meet the deeper wants of
   the heart. It must fill them with longings for a new religion.

   The Romans were the practical and political nation of antiquity. Their
   calling was to carry out the idea of the state and of civil law, and to
   unite the nations of the world in a colossal empire, stretching from
   the Euphrates to the Atlantic, and from the Libyan desert to the banks
   of the Rhine. This empire embraced the most fertile and civilized
   countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and about one hundred millions
   of human beings, perhaps one-third of the whole race at the time of the
   introduction of Christianity. [77] To this outward extent corresponds
   its historical significance. The history of every ancient nation ends,
   says Niebuhr, as the history of every modern nation begins, in that of
   Rome. Its history has therefore a universal interest; it is a vast
   storehouse of the legacies of antiquity. If the Greeks had, of all
   nations, the deepest mind, and in literature even gave laws to their
   conquerors, the Romans had the strongest character, and were born to
   rule the world without. This difference of course reached even into the
   moral and religious life of the two nations. Was the Greek, mythology
   the work of artistic fantasy and a religion of poesy, so was the Roman
   the work of calculation adapted to state purposes, political and
   utilitarian, but at the same time solemn, earnest, and energetic. "The
   Romans had no love of beauty, like the Greeks. They held no communion
   with nature, like the Germans. Their one idea was Rome--not ancient,
   fabulous, poetical Rome, but Rome warring and conquering; and orbis
   terrarum domina. S. P. Q. R.is inscribed on almost every page of their
   literature." [78]

   The Romans from the first believed themselves called to govern the
   world. They looked upon all foreigners--not as barbarians, like the
   cultured Greeks, but--as enemies to be conquered and reduced to
   servitude. War and triumph were their highest conception of human glory
   and happiness. The "Tu, regere imperio populos, Romane, memento!"had
   been their motto, in fact, long before Virgil thus gave it form. The
   very name of the urbs aeterna, and the characteristic legend of its
   founding, prophesied its future. In their greatest straits the Romans
   never for a moment despaired of the commonwealth. With vast energy,
   profound policy, unwavering consistency, and wolf-like rapacity, they
   pursued their ambitious schemes, and became indeed the lords, but also,
   as their greatest historian, Tacitus, says, the insatiable robbers of
   the world. [79]

   Having conquered the world by the sword, they organized it by law,
   before whose majesty every people had to bow, and beautified it by the
   arts of peace. Philosophy, eloquence, history, and poetry enjoyed a
   golden age under the setting sun of the republic and the rising sun of
   the empire, and extended their civilizing influence to the borders of
   barbarianism. Although not creative in letters and fine arts, the Roman
   authors were successful imitators of Greek philosophers, orators,
   historians, and poets. Rome was converted by Augustus from a city of
   brick huts into a city of marble palaces. [80] The finest paintings and
   sculptures were imported from Greece, triumphal arches and columns were
   erected on public places, and the treasures of all parts of the world
   were made tributary to, the pride, beauty, and luxury of the capital.
   The provinces caught the spirit of improvement, populous cities sprung
   up, and the magnificent temple of Jerusalem was rebuilt by the
   ambitious extravagance of Herod. The rights of persons and property
   were well protected. The conquered nations, though often and justly
   complaining of the rapacity of provincial governors, yet, on the whole,
   enjoyed greater security against domestic feuds and foreign invasion, a
   larger share of social comfort, and rose to a higher degree of secular
   civilization. The ends of the empire were brought into military,
   commercial, and literary communication by carefully constructed roads,
   the traces of which still exist in Syria, on the Alps, on the banks of
   the Rhine. The facilities and security of travel were greater in the
   reign of the Caesars than in any subsequent period before the
   nineteenth century. Five main lines went out from Rome to the
   extremities of the empire, and were connected at seaports with maritime
   routes. "We may travel," says a Roman writer, "at all hours, and sail
   from east to west." Merchants brought diamonds from the East, ambers
   from the shores of the Baltic, precious metals from Spain, wild animals
   from Africa, works of art from Greece, and every article of luxury, to
   the market on the banks of the Tiber, as they now do to the banks of
   the Thames. The Apocalyptic seer, in his prophetic picture of the
   downfall of the imperial mistress of the world, gives prominence to her
   vast commerce: "And the merchants of the earth," he says, "weep and
   mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
   merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and
   fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thine wood, and
   every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and
   of brass, and iron, and marble; and cinnamon, and spice, and incense,
   and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and
   wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and merchandise of horses and chariots
   and slaves; and souls of men. And the fruits that thy soul desired are
   departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and sumptuous are
   perished from thee, and men shall find them no more at all." [81]

   Heathen Rome lived a good while after this prediction, but, the causes
   of decay were already at work in the first century. The immense
   extension and outward prosperity brought with it a diminution of those
   domestic and civil virtues which at first so highly distinguished the
   Romans above the Greeks. The race of patriots and deliverers, who came
   from their ploughs to the public service, and humbly returned again to
   the plough or the kitchen, was extinct. Their worship of the gods,
   which was the root of their virtue, had sunk to mere form, running
   either into the most absurd superstitions, or giving place to unbelief,
   till the very priests laughed each other in the face when they met in
   the street. Not unfrequently we find unbelief and superstition united
   in the same persons, according to the maxim that all extremes touch
   each other. Man must believe something, and worship either God or the
   devil. [82] Magicians and necromancers abounded, and were liberally
   patronized. The ancient simplicity and contentment were exchanged for
   boundless avarice and prodigality. Morality and chastity, so
   beautifully symbolized in the household ministry of the virgin Vesta,
   yielded to vice and debauchery. Amusement came to be sought in
   barbarous fights of beasts and gladiators, which not rarely consumed
   twenty thousand human lives in a single month. The lower classes had
   lost all nobler feeling, cared for nothing but "panem et circenses,"
   and made the proud imperial city on the Tiber a slave of slaves. The
   huge empire of Tiberius and of Nero was but a giant body without a
   soul, going, with steps slow but sure, to final dissolution. Some of
   the emperors were fiendish tyrants and monsters of iniquity; and yet
   they were enthroned among the gods by a vote of the Senate, and altars
   and temples were erected for their worship. This characteristic custom
   began with Caesar, who even during his lifetime was honored as "Divus
   Julius" for his brilliant victories, although they cost more than a
   million of lives slain and another million made captives and slaves.
   [83] The dark picture which St. Paul, in addressing the Romans, draws
   of the heathenism of his day, is fully sustained by Seneca, Tacitus,
   Juvenal, Persius, and other heathen writers of that age, and shows the
   absolute need of redemption. "The world," says Seneca, in a famous
   passage, "is full of crimes and vices. More are committed than can be
   cured by force. There is an immense struggle for iniquity. Crimes are
   no longer bidden, but open before the eyes. Innocence is not only rare,
   but nowhere." [84] Thus far the negative. On the other hand, the
   universal empire of Rome was a positive groundwork for the universal
   empire of the gospel. It served as a crucible, in which all
   contradictory and irreconcilable peculiarities of the ancient nations
   and religions were dissolved into the chaos of a new creation. The
   Roman legions razed the partition-walls among the ancient nations,
   brought the extremes of the civilized world together in free
   intercourse, and united north and south and east and west in the bonds
   of a common language and culture, of common laws and customs. Thus they
   evidently, though unconsciously, opened the way for the rapid and
   general spread of that religion which unites all nations in one family
   of God by the spiritual bond of faith and love.

   The idea of a common humanity, which underlies all the distinctions of
   race, society and education, began to dawn in the heathen mind, and
   found expression in the famous line of Terentius, which was received
   with applause in the theatre:

   "Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto."

   This spirit of humanity breathes in Cicero and Virgil. Hence the
   veneration paid to the poet of the Aeneid by the fathers and throughout
   the middle ages. Augustine calls him the noblest of poets, and Dante,
   "the glory and light of other poets," and "his master," who guided him
   through the regions of hell and purgatory to the very gates of
   Paradise. It was believed that in his fourth Eclogue he had prophesied
   the advent of Christ. This interpretation is erroneous; but "there is
   in Virgil," says an accomplished scholar, [85] "a vein of thought and
   sentiment more devout, more humane, more akin to the Christian than is
   to be found in any other ancient poet, whether Greek or Roman. He was a
   spirit prepared and waiting, though he knew it not, for some better
   thing to be revealed."

   The civil laws and institutions, also, and the great administrative
   wisdom of Rome did much for the outward organization of the Christian
   church. As the Greek church rose on the basis of the Grecian
   nationality, so the Latin church rose on that of ancient Rome, and
   reproduced in higher forms both its virtues and its defects. Roman
   Catholicism is pagan Rome baptized, a Christian reproduction of the
   universal empire seated of old in the city of the seven hills.

   § 13. Judaism and Heathenism in Contact.

   The Roman empire, though directly establishing no more than an outward
   political union, still promoted indirectly a mutual intellectual and
   moral approach of the hostile religious of the Jews and Gentiles, who
   were to be reconciled in one divine brotherhood by the supernatural
   power of the cross of Christ.

   1. The Jews, since the Babylonish captivity, had been scattered over
   all the world. They were as ubiquitous in the Roman empire in the first
   century as they are now throughout, Christendom. According to Josephus
   and Strabo, there was no country where they did not make up a part of
   the population. [86] Among the witnesses of the miracle of Pentecost
   were "Jews from every nation under heaven ... Parthians and Medes and
   Elamites, and the dwellers of Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in
   Pontus and Asia, in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of
   Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
   Cretans and Arabians." [87] In spite of the antipathy of the Gentiles,
   they had, by talent and industry, risen to wealth, influence, and every
   privilege, and had built their synagogues in all the commercial cities
   of the Roman empire. Pompey brought a considerable number of Jewish
   captives from Jerusalem to the capital (b.c. 63), and settled them on
   the right bank of the Tiber (Trastevere). By establishing this
   community he furnished, without knowing it, the chief material for the
   Roman church. Julius Caesar was the great protector of the Jews; and
   they showed their gratitude by collecting for many nights to lament his
   death on the forum where his murdered body was burnt on a funeral pile.
   [88] He granted them the liberty of public worship, and thus gave them
   a legal status as a religious society. Augustus confirmed these
   privileges. Under his reign they were numbered already by thousands in
   the city. A reaction followed; Tiberius and Claudius expelled them from
   Rome; but they soon returned, and succeeded in securing the free
   exercise of their rites and customs. The frequent satirical allusions
   to them prove their influence as well as the aversion and contempt in
   which they were held by the Romans. Their petitions reached the ear of
   Nero through his wife Poppaea, who seems to have inclined to their
   faith; and Josephus, their most distinguished scholar, enjoyed the
   favor of three emperors--Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. In the
   language of Seneca (as quoted by Augustin) "the conquered Jews gave
   laws to their Roman conquerors."

   By this dispersion of the Jews the seeds of the knowledge of the true
   God and the Messianic hope were sown in the field of the idolatrous
   world. The Old Testament Scriptures were translated into Greek two
   centuries before Christ, and were read and expounded in the public
   worship of God, which was open to all. Every synagogue was a
   mission-station of monotheism, and furnished the apostles an admirable
   place and a natural introduction for their preaching of Jesus Christ as
   the fulfiller of the law and the prophets.

   Then, as the heathen religious had been hopelessly undermined by
   skeptical philosophy and popular infidelity, many earnest Gentiles
   especially multitudes of women, came over to Judaism either, wholly or
   in part. The thorough converts, called "proselytes of righteousness,"
   [89] were commonly still more bigoted and fanatical than the native
   Jews. The half-converts, "proselytes of the gate" [90] or "fearers of
   God," [91] who adopted only the monotheism, the principal moral laws,
   and the Messianic hopes of the Jews, without being circumcised, appear
   in the New Testament as the most susceptible hearers of the gospel, and
   formed the nucleus of many of the first Christian churches. Of this
   class were the centurion of Capernaum, Cornelius of Caesarea, Lydia of
   Philippi, Timothy, and many other prominent disciples.

   2. On the other hand, the Graeco-Roman heathenism, through its
   language, philosophy, and literature, exerted no inconsiderable
   influence to soften the fanatical bigotry of the higher and more
   cultivated classes of the Jews. Generally the Jews of the dispersion,
   who spoke the Greek language--the "Hellenists," as they were
   called--were much more liberal than the proper "Hebrews," or
   Palestinian Jews, who kept their mother tongue. This is evident in the
   Gentile missionaries, Barnabas of Cyprus and Paul of Tarsus, and in the
   whole church of Antioch, in contrast with that at Jerusalem. The
   Hellenistic form of Christianity was the natural bridge to the Gentile.

   The most remarkable example of a transitional, though very fantastic
   and Gnostic-like combination of Jewish and heathen elements meets us in
   the educated circles of the Egyptian metropolis, Alexandria, and in the
   system of Philo, who was born about b.c. 20, and lived till after a.d.
   40, though he never came in contact with Christ or the apostles. This
   Jewish, divine sought to harmonize the religion of Moses with the
   philosophy of Plato by the help of an ingenious but arbitrary
   allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament; and from the books of
   Proverbs and of Wisdom he deduced a doctrine of the Logos so strikingly
   like that of John's Gospel, that many expositors think it necessary to
   impute to the apostle an acquaintance with the writings, or at least
   with the terminology of Philo. But Philo's speculation is to the
   apostle's "Word made flesh" as a shadow to the body, or a dream to the
   reality. He leaves no room for an incarnation, but the coincidence of
   his speculation with the great fact is very remarkable. [92]

   The Therapeutae or Worshippers, a mystic and ascetic sect in Egypt,
   akin to the Essenes in Judaea, carried this Platonic Judaism into
   practical life; but were, of course, equally unsuccessful in uniting
   the two religions in a vital and permanent way. Such a union could only
   be effected by a new religion revealed from heaven. [93]

   Quite independent of the philosophical Judaism of Alexandria were the
   Samaritans, a mixed race, which also combined, though in a different
   way, the elements of Jewish and Gentile religion. [94] They date from
   the period of the exile. They held to the Pentateuch, to circumcision,
   and to carnal Messianic hopes; but they had a temple of their own on
   Mount Gerizim, and mortally hated the proper Jews. Among these
   Christianity, as would appear from the interview of Jesus with the
   woman of Samaria, [95] and the preaching of Philip, [96] found ready
   access, but, as among the Essenes and Therapeutae fell easily into a
   heretical form. Simon Magus, for example, and some other Samaritan
   arch-heretics, are represented by the early Christian writers as the
   principal originators of Gnosticism.

   3. Thus was the way for Christianity prepared on every side, positively
   and negatively, directly and indirectly, in theory and in practice, by
   truth and by error, by false belief and by unbelief--those hostile
   brothers, which yet cannot live apart--by Jewish religion, by Grecian
   culture, and by Roman conquest; by the vainly attempted amalgamation of
   Jewish and heathen thought, by the exposed impotence of natural
   civilization, philosophy, art, and political power, by the decay of the
   old religions, by the universal distraction and hopeless misery of the
   age, and by the yearnings of all earnest and noble souls for the
   religion of salvation.

   "In the fulness of the time," when the fairest flowers of science and
   art had withered, and the world was on the verge of despair, the
   Virgin's Son was born to heal the infirmities of mankind. Christ
   entered a dying world as the author of a new and imperishable life.

   § 14. Sources and Literature.

   A. Sources.

   Christ himself wrote nothing, but furnished endless material for books
   and songs of gratitude and praise. The living Church of the redeemed is
   his book. He founded a religion of the living spirit, not of a written
   code, like the Mosaic law. ( His letter to King Abgarus of Edessa, in
   Euseb., Hist. Eccl., I. 13, is a worthless fabrication.) Yet his words
   and deeds are recorded by as honest and reliable witnesses as ever put
   pen to paper.

   I. Authentic Christian Sources.

   (1) The four Canonical Gospels. Whatever their origin and date, they
   exhibit essentially the same divine-human life and character of Christ,
   which stands out in sharp contrast with the fictitious Christ of the
   Apocryphal Gospels, and cannot possibly have been invented, least of
   all by illiterate Galileans. They would never have thought of writing
   books without the inspiration of their Master.

   (2) The Acts of Luke, the Apostolic Epistles, and the Apocalypse of
   John. They presuppose, independently of the written Gospels, the main
   facts of the gospel-history, especially the crucifixion and the
   resurrection, and abound in allusions to these facts. Four of the
   Pauline Epistles (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians) are admitted
   as genuine by the most extreme of liberal critics (Baur and the
   Tübingen School), and from them alone a great part of the life of
   Christ might be reconstructed. (See the admissions of Keim, Gesch. Jesu
   v. Naz., I. 35 sqq.)

   II. Apocryphal Gospels:

   The Apocryphal Gospels are very numerous (about 50), some of them only
   known by name, others in fragments, and date from the second and later
   centuries. They are partly heretical (Gnostic and Ebionite) perversions
   or mutilations of the real history, partly innocent compositions of
   fancy, or religious novels intended to link together the disconnected
   periods of Christ's biography, to satisfy the curiosity concerning his
   relations, his childhood, his last days, and to promote the
   glorification of the Virgin Mary. They may be divided into four
   classes: (1) Heretical Gospels (as the Evangelium Cerinthi, Ev.
   Marcionis, Ev. Judae Ischariotae, Ev. secundum Hebraeos, etc.); (2)
   Gospels of Joseph and Mary, and the birth of Christ (Protevangelium
   Jacobi, Evang. Pseudo-Mathaei sive liber de Ortu Beatae Mariae et
   Infantia Salvatoris, Evang. de Nativitate Mariae, Historia Josephi
   Fabri lignarii, etc.); (3) Gospels of the childhood of Jesus from the
   flight to Egypt till his eighth or twelfth year (Evang. Thomae, of
   Gnostic origin, Evang. Infantiae Arabicum, etc.); (4) Gospels of the
   passion and the mysterious triduum in Hades (Evang. Nicodemi, including
   the Gesta or Acta Pilati and the Descensus ad Inferos, Epistola Pilati,
   a report of Christ's passion to the emperor Tiberius, Paradosis Pilati,
   Epistolae Herodis ad Pilatum and Pilati ad Herodem, Responsum Tiberii
   ad Pilatum, Narratio Josephi Arimathiensis, etc.). It is quite probable
   that Pilate sent an account of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus to
   his master in Rome (as Justin Martyr and Tertullian confidentially
   assert), but the various documents bearing his name are obviously
   spurious, including the one recently published by Geo. Sluter (The Acta
   Pilati, Shelbyville, Ind. 1879), who professes to give a translation
   from the supposed authentic Latin copy in the Vatican Library.

   These apocryphal productions have no historical, but considerable
   apologetic value; for they furnish by their contrast with the genuine
   Gospels a very strong negative testimony to the historical truthfulness
   of the Evangelists, as a shadow presupposes the light, a counterfeit
   the real coin, and a caricature the original picture. They have
   contributed largely to mediaeval art (e.g., the ox and the ass in the
   history of the nativity), and to the traditional Mariology and
   Mariolatry of the Greek and Roman churches, and have supplied Mohammed
   with his scanty knowledge of Jesus and Mary.

   Apocryphus Novi Testamenti, Hamburg, 1703, 2d ed. 1719), Thilo (Cod.

   III. Jewish Sources.

   The O. Test. Scriptures are, in type and prophecy, a preparatory
   history of Christ, and become fully intelligible only in him who came
   "to fulfill the law and the prophets."

   The Apocryphal and post-Christian Jewish writings give us a full view
   of the outward framework of society and religion in which the life of
   Christ moved, and in this way they illustrate and confirm the Gospel
   accounts.

   IV. The famous testimony of the Jewish historian Josephus (d. after
   a.d. 103) deserves special consideration. In his Antiqu. Jud., 1.
   xviii. cap. 3,§ 3, he gives the following striking summary of the life
   of Jesus:

   "Now there rose about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to
   call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works (paradoxon ergon
   poietes), a teacher of such men as receive the truth with gladness. He
   carried away with him many of the Jews and also many of the Greeks. He
   was the Christ (ho Christos houtos en). And after Pilate, at the
   suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the
   cross, his first adherents did not forsake him. For he appeared to them
   alive again the third day (ephane gar autois triten echon hemeran palin
   zon); the divine prophets having foretold these and ten thousand other
   wonderful things (alla muria thaumasia) concerning him. And the tribe
   of those called Christians, after him, is not extinct to this day."

   This testimony is first quoted by Eusebius, twice, without a misgiving
   (Hist. Eccl., I. II; and Demonstr. Evang., III. 5), and was considered
   genuine down to the 16th century, but has been disputed ever since. We
   have added the most doubtful words in Greek.

   The following are the arguments for the genuineness:

   (1) The testimony is found in all the MSS. of Josephus.

   But these MSS. were written by Christians, and we have none older than
   from the 11th century.

   (2) It agrees with the style of Josephus.

   (3) It is extremely improbable that Josephus, in writing a history of
   the Jews coming down to a.d. 66, should have ignored Jesus; all the
   more since he makes favorable mention of John the Baptist (Antiqu.,
   XVIII. 5, 2), and of the martyrdom of James "the Brother of Jesus
   called the Christ" (Antiqu. XX 9, 1: ton adelphon Iesou tou legomenou
   Christou, Iakabos onoma auto). Both passages are generally accepted as
   genuine, unless the words tou legomenou Christoushould be an
   interpolation.

   Against this may be said that Josephus may have had prudential reasons
   for ignoring Christianity altogether.

   Arguments against the genuineness:

   (1) The passage interrupts the connection.

   But not necessarily. Josephus had just recorded a calamity which befell
   the Jews under Pontius Pilate, in consequence of a sedition, and he may
   have regarded the crucifixion of Jesus as an additional calamity. He
   then goes on (§ 4 and 5) to record another calamity, the expulsion of
   the Jews from Rome under Tiberius.

   (2) It betrays a Christian, and is utterly inconsistent with the known
   profession of Josephus as a Jewish priest of the sect of the Pharisees.
   We would rather expect him to have represented Jesus as an impostor, or
   as an enthusiast.

   But it may be urged, on the other hand, that Josephus, with all his
   great literary merits, is also known as a vain and utterly unprincipled
   man, as a renegade and sycophant who glorified and betrayed his nation,
   who served as a Jewish general in the revolt against Rome, and then,
   after having been taken prisoner, flattered the Roman conquerors, by
   whom he was richly rewarded. History furnishes many examples of similar
   inconsistencies. Remember Pontius Pilate who regarded Christ as
   innocent, and yet condemned him to death, the striking testimonies of
   Rousseau and Napoleon I. to the divinity of Christ, and also the
   concessions of Renan, which contradict his position.

   (3) It is strange that the testimony should not have been quoted by
   such men as Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, or any
   other writer before Eusebius (d. 340), especially by Origen, who
   expressly refers to the passages of Josephus on John the Baptist and
   James (Contra Cels., I. 35, 47). Even Chrysostom (d. 407), who
   repeatedly mentions Josephus, seems to have been ignorant of this
   testimony.

   In view of these conflicting reasons, there are different opinions:

   (1) The passage is entirely genuine. This old view is defended by
   Hauteville, Oberthür, Bretschneider, Böhmert, Whiston, Schoedel (1840),
   Böttger (Das Zeugniss des Jos., Dresden, 1863).

   (2) It is wholly interpolated by a Christian hand. Bekker (in his ed.
   of Jos., 1855), Hase (1865 and 1876), Keim (1867), Schürer (1874).

   (3) It is partly genuine, partly interpolated. Josephus probably wrote
   Xristos outos elegeto(as in the passage on James), but not henand all
   other Christian sentences were added by a transcriber before Eusebius,
   for apologetic purposes. So Paulus, Heinichen, Gieseler (I. § 24, p.
   81, 4th Germ. ed.), Weizsäcker, Renan, Farrar. In the introduction to
   his Vie de Jésus (p. xii.), Renan says: "Je crois le passage sur Jésus
   authentique. Il est parfaitement dans le goût de Joseph, et si cet
   historian a fait mention de Jésus, c'est bien comme cela qu'il a dû en
   parler. On sent seulement qu'une main chrétienne a retouché le morceau,
   y a ajouté quelques mots sans lesquels il eút été presque
   blasphématoire, a peut-étre retranché ou modifié quelques expressions "

   (4) It is radically changed from a Jewish calumny into its present
   Christian form. Josephus originally described Jesus as a
   pseudo-Messiah, a magician, and seducer of the people, who was justly
   crucified. So Paret and Ewald (Gesch. Christus', p. 183, 3d ed.).

   It is difficult to resist the conclusion that Josephus must have taken
   some notice of the greatest event in Jewish history (as he certainly
   did of John the Baptist and of James), but that his statement--whether
   non-committal or hostile--was skillfully enlarged or altered by a
   Christian hand, and thereby deprived of its historical value.

   In other respects, the writings of Josephus contain, indirectly, much
   valuable testimony, to the truth of the gospel history. His History of
   the Jewish War is undesignedly a striking commentary on the predictions
   of our Saviour concerning the destruction of the city and the temple of
   Jerusalem; the great distress and affliction of the Jewish people at
   that time; the famine, pestilence, and earthquake; the rise of false
   prophets and impostors, and the flight of his disciples at the approach
   of these calamities. All these coincidences have been traced out in
   full by the learned Dr. Lardner, in his Collection of Ancient Jewish
   and Heathen Testimonies to the Truth of the Christian Religion, first
   published 1764-'67, also in vol. vi. of his Works, ed. by Kippis, Lond.
   1838.

   V. Heathen testimonies are few and meagre. This fact must be accounted
   for by the mysterious origin, the short duration and the unworldly
   character of the life and work of Christ, which was exclusively devoted
   to the kingdom of heaven, and, was enacted in a retired country and
   among a people despised by the proud Greeks and Romans.

   The oldest heathen testimony is probably in the Syriac letter of Mara,
   a philosopher, to his son Serapion, about a.d. 74, first published by
   Cureton, in Spicilegium Syriacum, Lond. 1855, and translated by Pratten
   in the "Ante-Nicene Library," Edinb. vol. xxiv. (1872), 104-114. Here
   Christ is compared to Socrates and Pythagoras, and called "the wise
   king of the Jews," who were justly punished for murdering him. Ewald
   (l.c. p. 180) calls this testimony "very remarkable for its simplicity
   and originality as well as its antiquity."

   Roman authors of the 1st and 2d centuries make only brief and
   incidental mention of Christ as the founder of the Christian religion,
   and of his crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, in the reign of Tiberius.
   Tacitus, Annales, I. xv. cap. 44, notices him in connection with his
   account of the conflagration at Rome and the Neronian persecution, in
   the words: "Auctor nominis ejus [Christiani] Christus Tiberio
   imperitante per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat,"
   and calls the Christian religion an exitiabilis superstitio.Comp. his
   equally contemptuous misrepresentation of the Jews in Hist., v. c. 3-5.
   Other notices are found in Suetonius: Vita Claudii, c. 25; Vita
   Neronis, c. 16; Plinius, jun.: Epist., X. 97, 98; Lucian: De morte
   Peregr., c. 11; Lampridius: Vita Alexandri Severi, c. 29, 43.

   The heathen opponents of Christianity, Lucian, Celsus, Porphyry, Julian
   the Apostate, etc., presuppose the principal facts of the
   gospel-history, even the miracles of Jesus, but they mostly derive
   them, like the Jewish adversaries, from evil spirits. Comp. my book on
   the Person of Christ, Appendix, and Dr. Nath. Lardner's Credibility,
   and Collection of Testimonies.

   B. Biographical and Critical.

   The numerous Harmonies of the Gospel began already a.d. 170, with
   Tatian's to dia tessaron(on which Ephraem Syrus, in the fourth century,
   wrote a commentary, published in Latin from an Armenian version in the
   Armenian convent at Venice, 1876). The first biographies of Christ were
   ascetic or poetic, and partly legendary. See Hase, Leben Jesu, § 17-19.
   The critical period began with the infidel and infamous attacks of
   Reimarus, Bahrdt, and Venturini, and the noble apologetic works of
   Hess, Herder, and Reinhard. But a still greater activity was stimulated
   by the Leben Jesu of Strauss, 1835 and again by Renan's Vie de Jésus,
   1863.

   The works of Paulus, Strauss, and Renan (also Joseph Salvador, a
   learned Jew in France, author of Jésus Christ et sa doctrine, Par.
   1838) represent the various phases of rationalism and destructive
   criticism, but have called forth also a copious and valuable apologetic
   literature. See the bibliography in Hase's Leben Jesu, 5th ed. p. 44
   sqq., and in his Geschichte Jesu, p. 124 sqq. Schleiermacher, Gfrörer,
   Weisse, Ewald, Schenkel, Hase, and Keim occupy, in various degrees and
   with many differences, a middle position. The great Schleiermacher
   almost perished in the sea of scepticism, but, like Peter, he caught
   the saving arm of Jesus extended to him (Matt. 14:30, 31). Hase is very
   valuable for the bibliography and suggestive sketches, Ewald and Keim
   for independent research and careful use of Josephus and the
   contemporary history. Keim rejects, Ewald accepts, the Gospel of John
   as authentic; both admit the sinless perfection of Jesus, and Keim,
   from his purely critical and synoptical standpoint, goes so far as to
   say (vol. iii. 662) that Christ, in his gigantic elevation above his
   own and succeeding ages, "makes the impression of mysterious
   loneliness, superhuman miracle, divine creation (den Eindruck
   geheimnissvoller Einsamkeit, übermenschlichen Wunders, göttlicher
   Schöpfung)." Weiss and Beyschlag mark a still greater advance, and
   triumphantly defend the genuineness of John's Gospel, but make
   concessions to criticism in minor details.

   § 15. The Founder of Christianity.

   When "the fulness of the time" was come, God sent forth his
   only-begotten Son, "the Desire of all nations," to redeem the world
   from the curse of sin, and to establish an everlasting kingdom of
   truth, love, and peace for all who should believe on his name.

   In Jesus Christ a preparatory history both divine and human comes to
   its close. In him culminate all the previous revelations of God to Jews
   and Gentiles; and in him are fulfilled the deepest desires and efforts
   of both Gentiles and Jews for redemption. In his divine nature, as
   Logos, he is, according to St. John, the eternal Son of the Father, and
   the agent in the creation and preservation of the world, and in all
   those preparatory manifestations of God, which were completed in the
   incarnation. In his human nature, as Jesus of Nazareth, he is the ripe
   fruit of the religions growth of humanity, with an earthly ancestry,
   which St. Matthew (the evangelist of Israel) traces to Abraham, the
   patriarch of the Jews, and St. Luke (the evangelist of the Gentiles),
   to Adam, the father of all men. In him dwells all the fulness of the
   Godhead bodily; and in him also is realized the ideal of human virtue
   and piety. He is the eternal Truth, and the divine Life itself,
   personally joined with our nature; he is our Lord and our God; yet at
   the same time flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone. In him is solved
   the problem of religion, the reconciliation and fellowship of man with
   God; and we must expect no clearer revelation of God, nor any higher
   religious attainment of man, than is already guaranteed and actualized
   in his person.

   But as Jesus Christ thus closes all previous history, so, on the other
   hand, he begins an endless future. He is the author of a new creation,
   the second Adam, the father of regenerate humanity, the head of the
   church, "which is his body, the fulness of him, that filleth all in
   all." He is the pure fountain of that stream of light and life, which
   has since flowed unbroken through nations and ages, and will continue
   to flow, till the earth shall be full of his praise, and every tongue
   shall confess that he is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. The
   universal diffusion and absolute dominion of the spirit and life of
   Christ will be also the completion of the human race, the end of
   history, and the beginning of a glorious eternity.

   It is the great and difficult task of the biographer of Jesus to show
   how he, by external and internal development, under the conditions of a
   particular people, age, and country, came to be in fact what he was in
   idea and destination, and what he will continue to be for the faith of
   Christendom, the God-Man and Saviour of the world. Being divine from
   eternity, he could not become God; but as man he was subject to the
   laws of human life and gradual growth. "He advanced in wisdom and
   stature, and in favor with God and man." [97] Though he was the Son of
   God, "yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered; and
   having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
   unto all them that obey him." [98] There is no conflict between the
   historical Jesus of Nazareth and the ideal Christ of faith. The full
   understanding of his truly human life, by its very perfection and
   elevation above all other men before and after him, will necessarily
   lead to an admission of his own testimony concerning his divinity.


   "Deep strike thy roots, O heavenly Vine,

   Within our earthly sod!

   Most human and yet most divine,

   The flower of man and God!"

   Jesus Christ came into the world under Caesar Augustus, the first Roman
   emperor, before the death of king Herod the Great, four years before
   the traditional date of our Dionysian aera. He was born at Bethlehem of
   Judaea, in the royal line of David, from Mary, "the wedded Maid and
   Virgin Mother." The world was at peace, and the gates of Janus were
   closed for only the second time in the history of Rome. There is a
   poetic and moral fitness in this coincidence: it secured a hearing for
   the gentle message of peace which might have been drowned in the
   passions of war and the clamor of arms. Angels from heaven proclaimed
   the good tidings of his birth with songs of praise; Jewish shepherds
   from the neighboring fields, and heathen sages from the far east
   greeted the newborn king and Saviour with the homage of believing
   hearts. Heaven and earth gathered in joyful adoration around the
   Christ-child, and the blessing of this event is renewed from year to
   year among high and low, rich and poor, old and young, throughout the
   civilized world.

   The idea of a perfect childhood, sinless and holy, yet truly human and
   natural, had never entered the mind of poet or historian before; and
   when the legendary fancy of the Apocryphal Gospels attempted to fill
   out the chaste silence of the Evangelists, it painted an unnatural
   prodigy of a child to whom wild animals, trees, and dumb idols bowed,
   and who changed balls of clay into flying birds for the amusement of
   his playmates.

   The youth of Jesus is veiled in mystery. We know only one, but a very
   significant fact. When a boy of twelve years he astonished the doctors
   in the temple by his questions and answers, without repelling them by
   immodesty and premature wisdom, and filled his parents with reverence
   and awe by his absorption in the things of his heavenly Father, and yet
   was subject and obedient to them in all things. Here, too, there is a
   clear line of distinction between the supernatural miracle of history
   and the unnatural prodigy of apocryphal fiction, which represents Jesus
   as returning most learned answers to perplexing questions of the
   doctors about astronomy, medicine, physics, metaphysics, and
   hyperphysics. [99]

   The external condition and surroundings of his youth are in sharp
   contrast with the amazing result of his public life. He grew up quietly
   and unnoticed in a retired Galilean mountain village of proverbial
   insignificance, and in a lowly carpenter-shop, far away from the city
   of Jerusalem, from schools and libraries, with no means of instruction
   save those which were open to the humblest Jew--the care of godly
   parents, the beauties of nature, the services of the synagogue, the
   secret communion of the soul with God, and the Scriptures of the Old
   Testament, which recorded in type and prophecy his own character and
   mission. All attempts to derive his doctrine from any of the existing
   schools and sects have utterly failed. He never referred to the
   traditions of the elders except to oppose them. From the Pharisees and
   Sadducees he differed alike, and provoked their deadly hostility. With
   the Essenes he never came in contact. He was independent of human
   learning and literature, of schools and parties. He taught the world as
   one who owed nothing to the world. He came down from heaven and spoke,
   out of the fulness of his personal intercourse with the great Jehovah.
   He was no scholar, no artist, no orator; yet was he wiser than all
   sages, he spake as never man spake, and made an impression on his age
   and all ages after him such as no man ever made or can make. Hence the
   natural surprise of his countrymen as expressed in the question: "From
   whence hath this men these things?" "How knoweth this man letters,
   having never learned?" [100]

   He began his public ministry in the thirtieth year of his age, after
   the Messianic inauguration by the baptism of John, and after the
   Messianic probation in the wilderness--the counterpart of the
   temptation of the first Adam in Paradise. That ministry lasted only
   three years--and yet in these three years is condensed the deepest
   meaning of the history of religion. No great life ever passed so
   swiftly, so quietly, so humbly, so far removed from the noise and
   commotion of the world; and no great life after its close excited such
   universal and lasting interest. He was aware of this contrast: he
   predicted his deepest humiliation even to the death on the cross, and
   the subsequent irresistible attraction of this cross, which may be
   witnessed from day to day wherever his name is known. He who could say,
   "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto myself,"
   [101] knew more of the course of history and of the human heart than
   all the sages and legislators before and after him.

   He chose twelve apostles for the Jews and seventy disciples for the
   Gentiles, not from among the scholars and leaders, but from among the
   illiterate fishermen of Galilee. He had no home, no earthly
   possessions, no friends among the mighty and the rich. A few pious
   women from time to time filled his purse; and this purse was in the
   bands of a thief and a traitor. He associated with publicans and
   sinners, to raise them up to a higher and nobler life, and began his
   reformation among them lower classes, which were despised and neglected
   by the proud: hierarchy of the day. He never courted the favor of the
   great, but incurred their hatred and persecution. He never flattered,
   the prejudices of the age, but rebuked sin and vice among the high and
   the low, aiming his severest words at the blind leaders of the blind,
   the self-righteous hypocrites who sat on Moses' seat. He never
   encouraged the carnal Messianic hopes of the people, but withdrew when
   they wished to make him a king, and declared before the representative
   of the Roman empire that his kingdom was not of this world. He
   announced to his disciples his own martyrdom, and promised to them in
   this life only the same baptism of blood. He went about in Palestine,
   often weary of travel, but never weary of his work of love, doing good
   to the souls and bodies of men, speaking words of spirit and life, and
   working miracles of power and mercy.

   He taught the purest doctrine, as a direct revelation of his heavenly
   Father, from his own intuition and experience, and with a power and
   authority which commanded unconditional trust and obedience. He rose
   above the prejudices of party and sect, above the superstitions of his
   age and nation. He addressed the naked heart of man and touched the
   quick of the conscience. He announced the founding of a spiritual
   kingdom which should grow from the smallest seed to a mighty tree, and,
   working like leaven from within, should gradually pervade all nations
   and countries. This colossal idea, had never entered the imagination of
   men, the like of which he held fast even in the darkest hour of
   humiliation, before the tribunal of the Jewish high-priest and the
   Roman governor, and when suspended as a malefactor on the cross; and
   the truth of this idea is illustrated by every page of church history
   and in every mission station on earth.

   The miracles or signs which accompanied his teaching are supernatural,
   but not unnatural, exhibitions of his power over man and nature; no
   violations of law, but manifestations of a higher law, the superiority
   of mind over matter, the superiority of spirit over mind, the
   superiority of divine grace over human nature. They are all of the
   highest moral and of a profoundly symbolical significance, prompted by
   pure benevolence, and intended for the good of men; in striking
   contrast with deceptive juggler works and the useless and absurd
   miracles of apocryphal fiction. They were performed without any
   ostentation, with such simplicity and ease as to be called simply his
   "works." They were the practical proof of his doctrine and the natural
   reflex of his wonderful person. The absence of wonderful works in such
   a wonderful man would be the greatest wonder.

   His doctrine and miracles were sealed by the purest and holiest life in
   private and public. He could challenge his bitterest opponents with the
   question: "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" well knowing that they
   could not point to a single spot.

   At last he completed his active obedience by the passive obedience of
   suffering in cheerful resignation to the holy will of God. Hated and
   persecuted by the Jewish hierarchy, betrayed into their hands by Judas,
   accused by false witnesses, condemned by the Sanhedrin, rejected by the
   people denied by Peter, but declared innocent by the representative of
   the Roman law and justice, surrounded by his weeping mother and
   faithful disciples, revealing in those dark hours by word and silence
   the gentleness of a lamb and the dignity of a God, praying for his
   murderers, dispensing to the penitent thief a place in paradise,
   committing his soul to his heavenly Father he died, with the
   exclamation: "It is finished!" He died before he had reached the prime
   of manhood. The Saviour of the world a youth! He died the shameful
   death of the cross the just for the unjust, the innocent for the
   guilty, a free self, sacrifice of infinite love, to reconcile the world
   unto God. He conquered sin and death on their own ground, and thus
   redeemed and sanctified all who are willing to accept his benefits and
   to follow his example. He instituted the Lord's Supper, to perpetuate
   the memory of his death and the cleansing and atoning power of his
   blood till the end of time.

   The third day he rose from the grave, the conqueror of death and hell,
   the prince of life and resurrection. He repeatedly appeared to his
   disciples; he commissioned them to preach the gospel of the
   resurrection to every creature; he took possession of his heavenly
   throne, and by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he established the
   church, which he has ever since protected, nourished, and comforted,
   and with which he has promised to abide, till he shall come again in
   glory to judge the quick and the dead.

   This is a meagre outline of the story which the evangelists tell us
   with childlike simplicity, and yet with more general and lasting effect
   than could be produced by the highest art of historical composition.
   They modestly abstained from adding their own impressions to the record
   of the words and acts of the Master whose "glory they beheld, the glory
   as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."

   Who would not shrink from the attempt to describe the moral character
   of Jesus, or, having attempted it, be not dissatisfied with the result?
   Who can empty the ocean into a bucket? Who (we may ask with Lavater)
   "can paint the glory of the rising sun with a charcoal?" No artist's
   ideal comes up to the reality in this case, though his ideals may
   surpass every other reality. The better and holier a man is, the more
   he feels his need of pardon, and how far he falls short of his own
   imperfect standard of excellence. But Jesus, with the same nature as
   ours and tempted as we are, never yielded to temptation; never had
   cause for regretting any thought, word, or action; he never needed
   pardon, or conversion, or reform; he never fell out of harmony with his
   heavenly Father. His whole life was one unbroken act of
   self-consecration to the glory of God and the eternal welfare of his
   fellow-men. A catalogue of virtues and graces, however complete, would
   give us but a mechanical view. It is the spotless purity and
   sinlessness of Jesus as acknowledged by friend and foe; it is the even
   harmony and symmetry of all graces, of love to God and love to man, of
   dignity and humility of strength and tenderness, of greatness and
   simplicity, of self-control and submission, of active and passive
   virtue; it is, in one word, the absolute perfection which raises his
   character high above the reach of all other men and makes it an
   exception to a universal rule, a moral miracle in history. It is idle
   to institute comparisons with saints and sages, ancient or modern. Even
   the infidel Rousseau was forced to exclaim: "If Socrates lived and died
   like a sage, Jesus lived and died like a God." Here is more than the
   starry heaven above us, and the moral law within us, which filled the
   soul of Kant with ever-growing reverence and awe. Here is the holy of
   holies of humanity, here is the very gate of heaven.

   Going so far in admitting the human perfection of Christ--and how can
   the historian do otherwise?--we are driven a step farther, to the
   acknowledgment of his amazing claims, which must either be true, or
   else destroy all foundation for admiration and reverence in which he is
   universally held. It is impossible to construct a life of Christ
   without admitting its supernatural and miraculous character.

   The divinity of Christ, and his whole mission as Redeemer, is an
   article of faith, and, as such, above logical or mathematical
   demonstration. The incarnation or the union of the infinite divinity
   and finite humanity in one person is indeed the mystery of mysteries.
   "What can be more glorious than God? What more vile than flesh? What
   more wonderful than God in the flesh?" [102] Yet aside from all
   dogmatizing which lies outside of the province of the historian, the
   divinity of Christ has a self-evidencing power which forces itself
   irresistibly upon the reflecting mind and historical inquirer; while
   the denial of it makes his person an inexplicable enigma.

   It is inseparable from his own express testimony respecting himself, as
   it appears in every Gospel, with but a slight difference of degree
   between the Synoptists and St. John. Only ponder over it! He claims to
   be the long-promised Messiah who fulfilled the law and the prophets,
   the founder and lawgiver of a new and universal kingdom, the light of
   the world, the teacher of all nations and ages, from whose authority
   there is no appeal. He claims to have come into this world for the
   purpose to save the world from sin--which no merely human being can
   possibly do. He claims the power to forgive sins on earth; he
   frequently exercised that power, and it was for the sins of mankind, as
   he foretold, that he shed his own blood. He invites all men to follow
   him, and promises peace and life eternal to every one that believes in
   him. He claims pre-existence before Abraham and the world, divine
   names, attributes, and worship. He disposes from the cross of places in
   Paradise. In directing his disciples to baptize all nations, he
   coordinates himself with the eternal Father and the Divine Spirit, and
   promises to be with them to the consummation of the world and to come
   again in glory as the Judge of all men. He, the humblest and meekest of
   men, makes these astounding pretensions in the most easy and natural
   way; he never falters, never apologizes, never explains; he proclaims
   them as self-evident truths. We read them again and again, and never
   feel any incongruity nor think of arrogance and presumption.

   And yet this testimony, if not true, must be downright blasphemy or
   madness. The former hypothesis cannot stand a moment before the moral
   purity and dignity of Jesus, revealed in his every word and work, and
   acknowledged by universal consent. Self-deception in a matter so
   momentous, and with an intellect in all respects so clear and so sound,
   is equally out of the question. How could He be an enthusiast or a
   madman who never lost the even balance of his mind, who sailed serenely
   over all the troubles and persecutions, as the sun above the clouds,
   who always returned the wisest answer to tempting questions, who calmly
   and deliberately predicted his death on the cross, his resurrection on
   the third day, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the founding of his
   Church, the destruction of Jerusalem--predictions which have been
   literally fulfilled? A character so original, so complete, so uniformly
   consistent, so perfect, so human and yet so high above all human
   greatness, can be neither a fraud nor a fiction. The poet, as has been
   well said, would in this case be greater than the hero. It would take
   more than a Jesus to invent a Jesus.

   We are shut up then to the recognition of the divinity of Christ; and
   reason itself must bow in silent awe before the tremendous word: "I and
   the Father are one!" and respond with skeptical Thomas: "My Lord and my
   God!"

   This conclusion is confirmed by the effects of the manifestation of
   Jesus, which far transcend all merely human capacity and power. The
   history of Christianity, with its countless fruits of a higher and
   purer life of truth and love than was ever known before or is now known
   outside of its influence, is a continuous commentary on the life of
   Christ, and testifies on every page to the inspiration of his holy
   example. His power is felt on every Lord's Day from ten thousand
   pulpits, in the palaces of kings and the huts of beggars, in
   universities and colleges, in every school where the sermon on the
   Mount is read, in prisons, in almshouses, in orphan asylums, as well as
   in happy homes, in learned works and simple tracts in endless
   succession. If this history of ours has any value at all, it is a new
   evidence that Christ is the light and life of a fallen world.

   And there is no sign that his power is waning. His kingdom is more
   widely spread than ever before, and has the fairest prospect of final
   triumph in all the earth. Napoleon at St. Helena is reported to have
   been struck with the reflection that millions are now ready to die for
   the crucified Nazarene who founded a spiritual empire by love, while no
   one would die for Alexander, or Caesar, or himself, who founded
   temporal empires by force. He saw in this contrast a convincing
   argument for the divinity of Christ, saying: "I know men, and I tell
   you, Christ was not a man. Everything about Christ astonishes me. His
   spirit overwhelms and confounds me. There is no comparison between him
   and any other being. He stands single and alone. [103] And Goethe,
   another commanding genius, of very different character, but equally
   above suspicion of partiality for religion, looking in the last years
   of his life over the vast field of history, was constrained to confess
   that "if ever the Divine appeared on earth, it was in the Person of
   Christ," and that "the human mind, no matter how far it may advance in
   every other department, will never transcend the height and moral
   culture of Christianity as it shines and glows in the Gospels."

   The rationalistic, mythical, and legendary attempts to explain the life
   of Christ on purely human and natural grounds, and to resolve the
   miraculous elements either into common events, or into innocent
   fictions, split on the rock of Christ's character and testimony. The
   ablest of the infidel biographers of Jesus now profess the profoundest
   regard for his character, and laud him as the greatest sage and saint
   that ever appeared on earth. But, by rejecting his testimony concerning
   his divine origin and mission, they turn him into a liar; and, by
   rejecting the miracle of the resurrection, they make the great fact of
   Christianity a stream without a source, a house without a foundation,
   an effect without a cause. Denying the physical miracles, they expect
   us to believe even greater psychological miracles; yea, they substitute
   for the supernatural miracle of history an unnatural prodigy and
   incredible absurdity of their imagination. They moreover refute and
   supersede each other. The history of error in the nineteenth century is
   a history of self-destruction. A hypothesis was scarcely matured before
   another was invented and substituted, to meet the same fate in its
   turn; while the old truth and faith of Christendom remains unshaken,
   and marches on in its peaceful conquest against sin and error

   Truly, Jesus Christ, the Christ of the Gospels, the Christ of history,
   the crucified and risen Christ, the divine-human Christ, is the most
   real, the most certain, the most blessed of all facts. And this fact is
   an ever-present and growing power which pervades the church and
   conquers the world, and is its own best evidence, as the sun shining in
   the heavens. This fact is the only solution of the terrible mystery of
   sin and death, the only inspiration to a holy life of love to God and
   man, and only guide to happiness and peace. Systems of human wisdom
   will come and go, kingdoms and empires will rise and fall, but for all
   time to come Christ will remain "the Way, the Truth, and the Life."

   §16. Chronology of the Life of Christ.

   See the Lit. in §14, p. 98, especially Browne, Wieseler, Zumpt,
   Andrews, and Keim

   We briefly consider the chronological dates of the life of Christ.

   I. The Year of the Nativity.--This must be ascertained by historical
   and chronological research, since there is no certain and harmonious
   tradition on the subject. Our Christians aera, which was introduced by
   the Roman abbot Dionysius Exiguus, in the sixth century, and came into
   general use two centuries later, during the reign of Charlemagne, puts
   the Nativity Dec. 25, 754 Anno Urbis, that is, after the founding of
   the city of Rome. [104] Nearly all chronologers agree that this is
   wrong by at least four years. Christ was born a.u. 750 (or b.c. 4), if
   not earlier.

   This is evident from the following chronological hints in the Gospels,
   as compared with and confirmed by Josephus and contemporary writers,
   and by astronomical calculations.

   The Death of Herod.

   (1) According to Matthew 2:1 (Comp. Luke 1:5, 26), Christ was born "in
   the days of king Herod" I. or the Great, who died, according to
   Josephus, at Jericho, a.u. 750, just before the Passover, being nearly
   seventy years of age, after a reign of thirty-seven years [105] This
   date has been verified by the astronomical calculation of the eclipse
   of the moon, which took place March 13, a.u. 750, a few days before
   Herod's death. [106] Allowing two months or more for the events between
   the birth of Christ and the murder of the Innocents by Herod, the
   Nativity must be put back at least to February or January, a.u. 750 (or
   b.c. 4), if not earlier.

   Some infer from the slaughter of the male children in Bethlehem, "from
   two years old and under," [107] that Christ must have been born two
   years before Herod's death; but he counted from the time when the star
   was first seen by the Magi (Matt. 2:7), and wished to make sure of his
   object. There is no good reason to doubt the fact itself, and the
   flight of the holy family to Egypt, which is inseparably connected with
   it. For, although the horrible deed is ignored by Josephus, it is in
   keeping with the well-known cruelty of Herod, who from jealousy
   murdered Hyrcanus, the grandfather of his favorite wife, Mariamne; then
   Mariamne herself, to whom he was passionately attached; her two sons,
   Alexander and Aristobulus, and, only five days before his death, his
   oldest son, Antipater; and who ordered all the nobles assembled around
   him in his last moments to be executed after his decease, so that at
   least his death might be attended by universal mourning. For such a
   monster the murder of one or two dozen infants in a little town [108]
   was a very small matter, which might easily have been overlooked, or,
   owing to its connection with the Messiah, purposely ignored by the
   Jewish historian. But a confused remembrance of it is preserved in the
   anecdote related by Macrobius (a Roman grammarian and probably a
   heathen, about a.d. 410), that Augustus, on hearing of Herod's murder
   of "boys under two years" and of his own son, remarked "that it was
   better to be Herod's swine than his son." [109] The cruel persecution
   of Herod and the flight into Egypt were a significant sign of the
   experience of the early church, and a source of comfort in every period
   of martyrdom.

   The Star of the Magi.

   (2) Another chronological hint of Matthew 2:1-4, 9, which has been
   verified by astronomy, is the Star of the Wise Men, which appeared
   before the death of Herod, and which would naturally attract the
   attention of the astrological sages of the East, in connection with the
   expectation of the advent of a great king among the Jews. Such a belief
   naturally arose from Balaam's prophecy of "the star that was to rise
   out of Jacob" (Num. 24:17), and from the Messianic prophecies of Isaiah
   and Daniel, and widely prevailed in the East since the dispersion of
   the Jews. [110]

   The older interpretation of that star made it either a passing meteor,
   or a strictly miraculous phenomenon, which lies beyond astronomical
   calculation, and was perhaps visible to the Magi alone. But Providence
   usually works through natural agencies, and that God did so in this
   case is made at least very probable by a remarkable discovery in
   astronomy. The great and devout Kepler observed in the years 1603 and
   1604 a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, which was made more rare and
   luminous by the addition of Mars in the month of March, 1604. In the
   autumn of the same year (Oct. 10) he observed near the planets Saturn,
   Jupiter and Mars a new (fixed) star of uncommon brilliancy, which
   appeared "in triumphal pomp, like, some all-powerful monarch on a visit
   to the metropolis of his realm." It was blazing and glittering "like
   the most beautiful and glorious torch ever seen when driven by a strong
   wind," and seemed to him to be "an exceedingly wonderful work of God."
   [111] His genius perceived that this phenomenon must lead to the
   determination of the year of Christ's birth, and by careful calculation
   he ascertained that a similar conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, with
   the later addition of Mars, and probably some, extraordinary star, took
   place repeatedly a.u. 747 and 748 in the sign of the Pisces.

   It is worthy of note that Jewish astrologers ascribe a special
   signification to the conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in
   the sign of the Pisces, and connect it with the advent of the Messiah.
   [112]

   The discovery of Kepler was almost forgotten till the nineteenth
   century, when it was independently confirmed by several eminent
   astronomers, Schubert of Petersburg, Ideler and Encke of Berlin, and
   Pritchard of London. It is pronounced by Pritchard to be "as certain as
   any celestial phenomenon of ancient date." It certainly makes the
   pilgrimage of the Magi to Jerusalem and Bethlehem more intelligible.
   "The star of astrology has thus become a torch of chronology" (as
   Ideler says), and an argument for the truthfulness of the first Gospel.
   [113]

   It is objected that Matthew seems to mean a single star (aster, comp.
   Matt. 2:9) rather than a combination of stars (astron). Hence Dr.
   Wieseler supplements the calculation of Kepler and Ideler by calling to
   aid a single comet which appeared from February to April, a.u. 750,
   according to the Chinese astronomical tables, which Pingré and Humboldt
   acknowledge as historical. But this is rather far-fetched and hardly
   necessary; for that extraordinary star described by Kepler, or Jupiter
   at its most luminous appearance, as described by Pritchard, in that
   memorable conjunction, would sufficiently answer the description of a
   single star by Matthew, which must at all events not be pressed too
   literally; for the language of Scripture on the heavenly bodies is not
   scientific, but phenomenal and popular. God condescended to the
   astrological faith of the Magi, and probably made also an internal
   revelation to them before, as well as after the appearance of the star
   (comp. 2:12).

   If we accept the result of these calculations of astronomers we are
   brought to within two years of the year of the Nativity, namely,
   between a.u. 748 (Kepler) and 750 (Wieseler). The difference arises, of
   course, from the uncertainty of the time of departure and the length of
   the journey of the Magi.

   As this astronomical argument is often very carelessly and erroneously
   stated, and as the works of Kepler and Ideler are not easy of access,
   at least in America (I found them in the Astor Library), I may be
   permitted to state the case more at length. John Kepler wrote three
   treatises on the year of Christ's birth, two in Latin (1606 and 1614),
   one in German (1613), in which he discusses with remarkable learning
   the various passages and facts bearing on that subject. They are
   reprinted in Dr. Ch. Frisch's edition of his Opera Omnia (Frcf. et
   Erlang. 1858-'70, 8 vols.), vol. IV. pp. 175 sqq.; 201 sqq.; 279 sqq.
   His astronomical observations on the constellation which led him to
   this investigation are fully described in his treatises De Stella Nova
   in Pede Serpentarii (Opera, vol. II. 575 sqq.), and Phenomenon
   singulare seu Mercurius in Sole (ibid. II. 801 sqq.). Prof. Ideler, who
   was himself an astronomer and chronologist, in his Handbuch der
   mathemat. und technischen Chronologie (Berlin, 1826, vol. III. 400
   sqq.), gives the following clear summary of Kepler's and of his own
   observations:

   "It is usually supposed that the star of the Magi was, if not a fiction
   of the imagination, some meteor which arose accidentally, or ad hoc. We
   will belong neither to the unbelievers nor the hyper-believers (weder
   zu den Ungläubigen noch zu den Uebergläubigen), and regard this starry
   phenomenon with Kepler to be real and well ascertainable by
   calculation, namely, as a conjunction of the Planets Jupiter and
   Saturn. That Matthew speaks only of a star (aster), not a constellation
   (astron), need not trouble us, for the two words are not unfrequently
   confounded. The just named great astronomer, who was well acquainted
   with the astrology of his and former times, and who used it
   occasionally as a means for commending astronomy to the attention and
   respect of the laity, first conceived this idea when he observed the
   conjunction of the two planets mentioned at the close of the year 1603.
   It took place Dec. 17. In the spring following Mars joined their
   company, and in autumn 1604 still another star, one of those fixed
   star-like bodies (einer jener fixstern-artigen Körper) which grow to a
   considerable degree of brightness, and then gradually disappear without
   leaving a trace behind. This star stood near the two planets at the
   eastern foot of Serpentarius (Schlangenträger), and appeared when last
   seen as a star of the first magnitude with uncommon splendor. From
   month to month it waned in brightness, and at the end of 1605 was
   withdrawn from the eyes which at that time could not yet be aided by
   good optical instruments. Kepler wrote a special work on this Stella
   nova in pede Serpentarii (Prague, 1606), and there he first set forth
   the view that the star of the Magi consisted in a conjunction of
   Saturn, Jupiter and some other extraordinary star, the nature of which
   he does not explain more fully." Ideler then goes on to report (p. 404)
   that Kepler, with the imperfect tables at his disposal, discovered the
   same conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn a.u. 747 in June, August and
   December, in the sign of the Pisces; in the next year, February and
   March, Mars was added, and probably another extraordinary star, which
   must have excited the astrologers of Chaldaea to the highest degree.
   They probably saw the new star first, and then the constellation.

   Dr. Münter, bishop of Seeland, in 1821 directed new attention to this
   remarkable discovery, and also to the rabbinical commentary of
   Abarbanel on Daniel, according to which the Jewish astrologers expected
   a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in the sign of the
   Pisces before the advent of the Messiah, and asked the astronomers to
   reinvestigate this point. Since then Schubert of Petersburg (1823),
   Ideler and Encke of Berlin (1826 and 1830), and more recently Pritchard
   of London, have verified Kepler's calculations.

   Ideler describes the result of his calculation (vol. II. 405) thus: I
   have made the calculation with every care .... The results are
   sufficiently remarkable. Both planets [Jupiter and Saturn] came in
   conjunction for the first time a.u. 747, May 20, in the 20th degree of
   Pisces. They stood then on the heaven before sunrise and were only one
   degree apart. Jupiter passed Saturn to the north. In the middle of
   September both came in opposition to the sun at midnight in the south.
   The difference in longitude was one degree and a half. Both were
   retrograde and again approached each other. On the 27th of October a
   second conjunction took place in the sixteenth degree of the Pisces,
   and on the 12th of November, when Jupiter moved again eastward, a third
   in the fifteenth degree of the same sign. In the last two
   constellations also the difference in longitude was only about one
   degree, so that to a weak eye both planets might appear as one star. If
   the Jewish astrologers attached great expectations to conjunction of
   the two upper planets in the sign of the Pisces, this one must above
   all have appeared to them as most significant."

   In his shorter Lehrbuch der Chronologie, which appeared Berlin 1831 in
   one vol., pp. 424-431, Ideler gives substantially the same account
   somewhat abridged, but with slight changes of the figures on the basis
   of a new calculation with still better tables made by the celebrated
   astronomer Encke, who puts the first conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn
   a.u. 747, May 29th, the second Sept. 30th, the third Dec. 5th. See the
   full table of Encke, p. 429.

   We supplement this account by an extract from an article on the Star of
   the Wise Men by the Rev. Charles Pritchard, M.A., Hon. Secretary of the
   Royal Astronomical Society, who made a fresh calculation of the
   constellation in a.u. 747, from May to December, and published the
   results in Memoirs of Royal Ast. Society, vol. xxv., and in Smith's
   "Bible Dictionary," p. 3108, Am. ed., where he says: "At that time [end
   of Sept., b.c. 7] there can be no doubt Jupiter would present to
   astronomers, especially in so clear an atmosphere, a magnificent
   spectacle. It was then at its most brilliant apparition, for it was at
   its nearest approach both to the sun and to the earth. Not far from it
   would be seen its duller and much less conspicuous companion, Saturn.
   This glorious spectacle continued almost unaltered for several days,
   when the planets again slowly separated, then came to a halt, when, by
   reassuming a direct motion, Jupiter again approached to a conjunction
   for a third time with Saturn, just as the Magi may be supposed to have
   entered the Holy City. And, to complete the fascination of the tale,
   about an hour and a half after sunset, the two planets might be seen
   from Jerusalem, hanging as it were in the meridian, and suspended over
   Bethlehem in the distance. These celestial phenomena thus described
   are, it will be seen, beyond the reach of question, and at the first
   impression they assuredly appear to fulfil the conditions of the Star
   of the Magi." If Pritchard, nevertheless, rejects the identity of the
   constellation with the single star of Matthew, it is because of a too
   literal understanding of Matthew's language, that the star proegen
   autousand estathe epano, which would make it miraculous in either case.

   The Fifteenth Year of Tiberius.

   (3) Luke 3:1, 23, gives us an important and evidently careful
   indication of the reigning powers at the time when John the Baptist and
   Christ entered upon their public ministry, which, according to
   Levitical custom, was at the age of thirty. [114] John the Baptist
   began his ministry "in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius,"
   [115] and Jesus, who was only about six months younger than John (comp.
   Luke 1:5, 26), was baptized and began to teach when he was "about
   thirty years of age." [116] Tiberius began to reign jointly with
   Augustus, as "collega imperii," a.u. 764 (or, at all events, in the
   beginning of 765), and independently, Aug. 19, a.u. 767 (a.d. 14);
   consequently, the fifteenth year of his reign was either a.u. 779, if
   we count from the joint reign (as Luke probably did, using the more
   general term hegemoniarather than monarchiaor basileia [117] or 782, if
   we reckon from the independent reign (as was the usual Roman method).
   [118]

   Now, if we reckon back thirty years from a.u. 779 or 782, we come to
   a.u. 749 or 752 as the year of John's birth, which preceded that of
   Christ about six months. The former date (749) is undoubtedly to be
   preferred, and agrees with Luke's own statement that Christ was born
   under Herod (Luke 1:5, 26). [119]

   Dionysius probably (for we have no certainty on the subject) calculated
   from the independent reign of Tiberius; but even that would not bring
   us to 754, and would involve Luke in contradiction with Matthew and
   with himself. [120]

   The other dates in Luke 3:1 generally agree with this result, but are
   less definite. Pontius Pilate was ten years governor of Judaea, from
   a.d. 26 to 36. Herod Antipas was deposed by Caligula, a.d. 39. Philip,
   his brother, died a.d. 34. Consequently, Christ must have died before
   a.d. 34, at an age of thirty-three, if we allow three years for his
   public ministry.

   The Census of Quirinius.

   (4) The Census of Quirinius Luke 2:2. [121] Luke gives us another
   chronological date by the incidental remark that Christ was born about
   the time of that census or enrolment, which was ordered by Caesar
   Augustus, and which was "the first made when Quirinius (Cyrenius) was
   governor [enrolment] of Syria." [122] He mentions this fact as the
   reason for the journey of Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem. The journey of
   Mary makes no difficulty, for (aside from the intrinsic propriety of
   his company for protection) all women over twelve years of age (and
   slaves also) were subject in the Roman empire to a head-tax, as well as
   men over fourteen) till the age of sixty-five. [123] There is some
   significance in the coincidence of the birth of the King of Israel with
   the deepest humiliation of Israel. and its incorporation in the great
   historical empire of Rome.

   But the statement of Luke seems to be in direct conflict with the fact
   that the governorship and census of Quirinius began a.d. 6, i.e., ten
   years after the birth of Christ [124] Hence many artificial
   interpretations. [125] But this difficulty is now, if not entirely
   removed, at least greatly diminished by archaeological and philological
   research independent of theology. It has been proved almost to a
   demonstration by Bergmann, Mommsen, and especially by Zumpt, that
   Quirinius was twice governor of Syria--first, a.u. 750 to 753, or b.c.
   4 to 1 (when there happens to be a gap in our list of governors of
   Syria), and again, a.u. 760-765 (a.d. 6-11). This double legation is
   based upon a passage in Tacitus, [126] and confirmed by an old
   monumental inscription discovered between the Villa Hadriani and the
   Via Tiburtina. [127] Hence Luke might very properly call the census
   about the time of Christ's birth "the first" (prote) under Quirinius,
   to distinguish it from the second and better known, which he himself
   mentions in his second treatise on the history of the origin of
   Christianity (Acts 5:37). Perhaps the experience of Quirinius as the
   superintendent of the first census was the reason why he was sent to
   Syria a second time for the same purpose.

   There still remain, however, three difficulties not easily solved: (a)
   Quirinius cannot have been governor of Syria before autumn a.u. 750
   (b.c. 4), several months after Herod's death (which occurred in March,
   750), and consequently after Christ's birth; for we know from coins
   that Quintilius Varus was governor from a.u. 748 to 750 (b.c. 6-4), and
   left his post after the death of Herod. [128] (b) A census during the
   first governorship of Quirinius is nowhere mentioned but in Luke. (c) A
   Syrian governor could not well carry out a census in Judaea during the
   lifetime of Herod, before it was made a Roman province (i.e., a.u.
   759).

   In reply to these objections we may say: (a) Luke did not intend to
   give an exact, but only an approximate chronological statement, and may
   have connected the census with the well-known name of Quirinius because
   be completed it, although it was begun under a previous administration.
   (b) Augustus ordered several census populi between a.u. 726 and 767,
   partly for taxation, partly for military and statistical purposes;
   [129] and, as a good statesman and financier, he himself prepared a
   rationarium or breviarium totius imperii, that is, a list of all the
   resources of the empire, which was read, after his death, in the
   Senate. [130] (c) Herod was only a tributary king (rex sosius), who
   could exercise no act of sovereignty without authority from the
   emperor. Judaea was subject to taxation from the time of Pompey, and it
   seems not to have ceased with the accession of Herod. Moreover, towards
   the end of his life he lost the favor of Augustus, who wrote him in
   anger that "whereas of old he had used him as his friend, he would now
   use him as his subject." [131]

   It cannot, indeed, be proven by direct testimony of Josephus or the
   Roman historians, that Augustus issued a decree for a universal census,
   embracing all the Provinces ("that all the world," i.e., the Roman
   world, "should be taxed," Luke 2:1), but it is in itself by no means
   improbable, and was necessary to enable him to prepare his breviarium
   totius imperii. [132] In the nature of the case, it would take several
   years to carry out such a decree, and its execution in the provinces
   would be modified according to national customs. Zumpt assumes that
   Sentius Saturninus, [133] who was sent as governor to Syria a.u. 746
   (b.c. 9), and remained there till 749 (b.c. 6), began a census in
   Judaea with a view to substitute a head tax in money for the former
   customary tribute in produce; that his successor, Quintilius Varus
   (b.c. 6-4), continued it, and that Quirinius (b.c. 4) completed the
   census. This would explain the confident statement of Tertullian, which
   he must have derived from some good source, that enrolments were held
   under Augustus by Sentius Saturninus in Judaea. [134] Another, but less
   probable view is that Quirinius was sent to the East as special
   commissioner for the census during the administration of his
   predecessor. In either case Luke might call the census "the first"
   under Quirinius, considering that he finished the census for personal
   taxation or registration according to the Jewish custom of family
   registers, and that afterwards he alone executed the second census for
   the taxation of property according to the Roman fashion.

   The problem is not quite solved; but the establishment of the fact that
   Quirinius was prominently connected with the Roman government in the
   East about the time of the Nativity, is a considerable step towards the
   solution, and encourages the hope of a still better solution in the
   future. [135]

   The Forty-Six Years of Building of Herod's Temple.

   (5) St. John, 2:20, furnishes us a date in the remark of the Jews, in
   the first year of Christ's ministry: "Forty and six years was this
   temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?"

   We learn from Josephus that Herod began the reconstruction of the
   temple in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of his reign, i.e., a.u.
   732, if we reckon from his appointment by the Romans (714), or a.u.
   735, if we reckon from the death of Antigonus and the conquest of
   Jerusalem (717). [136] The latter is the correct view; otherwise
   Josephus would contradict himself, since, in another passage, he dates
   the building from the fifteenth year, of Herod's reign. [137] Adding
   forty-six years to 735, we have the year a.u. 781 (a.d. 27) for the
   first year of Christ's ministry; and deducting thirty and a half or
   thirty-one years from 781, we come back to a.u. 750 (b.c. 4) as the
   year of the Nativity.

   The Time of the Crucifixion.

   (6) Christ was crucified under the consulate of the two Gemini (i.e.,
   C. Rubellius Geminus and C. Fufius Geminus), who were consuls a.u. 782
   to 783 (a.d. 28 to 29). This statement is made by Tertullian, in
   connection with an elaborate calculation of the time of Christ's birth
   and passion from the seventy weeks of Daniel. [138] He may possibly
   have derived it from some public record in Rome. He erred in
   identifying the year of Christ's passion with the first year of his
   ministry (the 15th year of Tiberius, Luke 3:1). Allowing, as we must,
   two or three years for his public ministry, and thirty-three years for
   his life, we reach the year 750 or 749 as the year of the Nativity.

   Thus we arrive from these various incidental notices of three
   Evangelists, and the statement of Tertullian essentially at the same
   conclusion, which contributes its share towards establishing the
   credibility of the gospel history against the mythical theory. Yet in
   the absence of a precise date, and in view of uncertainties in
   calculation, there is still room for difference of opinion between the
   years a.u. 747 (b.c. 7), as the earliest, and a.u. 750 (b.c. 4), as the
   latest, possible date for the year of Christ's birth. The French
   Benedictines, Sanclemente, Münter, Wurm, Ebrard, Jarvis, Alford, Jos.
   A. Alexander, Zumpt, Keim, decide for a.u. 747; Kepler (reckoning from
   the conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars in that year), Lardner,
   Ideler, Ewald, for 748; Petavius, Ussher, Tillemont, Browne, Angus,
   Robinson, Andrews, McClellan, for 749; Bengel, Wieseler, Lange,
   Lichtenstein, Anger, Greswell, Ellicott, Plumptre, Merivale, for 750.

   II. The Day of the Nativity.--The only indication of the season of our
   Saviour's birth is the fact that the Shepherds were watching their
   flocks in the field at that time, Luke 2:8. This fact points to any
   other season rather than winter, and is therefore not favorable to the
   traditional date, though not conclusive against it. The time of
   pasturing in Palestine (which has but two seasons, the dry and the wet,
   or summer and winter) begins, according to the Talmudists, in March,
   and lasts till November, when the herds are brought in from the fields,
   and kept under shelter till the close of February. But this refers
   chiefly to pastures in the wilderness, far away from towns and
   villages, [139] and admits of frequent exceptions in the close
   neighborhood of towns, according to the character of the season. A
   succession of bright days in December and January is of frequent
   occurrence in the East, as in Western countries. Tobler, an experienced
   traveller in the Holy Land, says that in Bethlehem the weather about
   Christmas is favorable to the feeding of flocks and often most
   beautiful. On the other hand strong and cold winds often prevail in
   April, and. explain the fire mentioned John 18:18.

   No certain conclusion can be drawn from the journey of Joseph and Mary
   to Bethlehem, and to Egypt; nor from the journey of the Magi. As a rule
   February, is the best time for travelling in Egypt, March the best in
   the Sinaitic Peninsula, April and May, and next to it autumn, the best
   in Palestine; but necessity knows no rule.

   The ancient tradition is of no account here, as it varied down to the
   fourth century. Clement of Alexandria relates that some regarded the
   25th Pachon. (i.e. May 20), others the 24th or 25th Pharmuthi (April 19
   or 20), as the day of Nativity.

   (1) The traditional 25th of December is defended by Jerome, Chrysostom,
   Baronius, Lamy, Ussher, Petavius, Bengel (Ideler), Seyffarth and
   Jarvis. It has no historical authority beyond the fourth century, when
   the Christmas festival was introduced first in Rome (before a.d. 360),
   on the basis of several Roman festivals (the Saturnalia, Sigillaria,
   Juvenalia, Brumalia, or Dies natalis Invicti Solis), which were held in
   the latter part of December in commemoration of the golden age of
   liberty and equality, and in honor of the sun, who in the winter
   solstice is, as it were, born anew and begins his conquering march.
   This phenomenon in nature was regarded as an appropriate symbol of the
   appearance of the Sun of Righteousness dispelling the long night of sin
   and error. For the same reason the summer solstice (June 24) was
   afterwards selected for the festival of John the Baptist, as the
   fittest reminder of his own humble self-estimate that he must decrease,
   while Christ must increase (John 3:30). Accordingly the 25th of March
   was chosen for the commemoration of the Annunciation of the Virgin
   Mary, and the 24th of September for that of the conception of
   Elizabeth. [140]

   (2) The 6th of January has in its favor an older tradition (according
   to Epiphanius and Cassianus), and is sustained by Eusebius. It was
   celebrated in the East from the third century as the feast of the
   Epiphany, in commemoration of the Nativity as well as of Christ's
   baptism, and afterwards of his manifestation to the Gentiles
   (represented by the Magi).

   (3) Other writers have selected some day in February (Hug, Wieseler,
   Ellicott), or March (Paulus, Winer), or April (Greswell), or August
   (Lewin), or September (Lightfoot, who assumes, on chronological
   grounds, that Christ was born on the feast of Tabernacles, as he died
   on the Passover and sent the Spirit on Pentecost), or October
   (Newcome). Lardner puts the birth between the middle of August and the
   middle of November; Browne December 8; Lichtenstein in summer; Robinson
   leaves it altogether uncertain.

   III. The Duration of Christ's Life.--This is now generally confined to
   thirty-two or three years. The difference of one or two years arises
   from the different views on the length of his public ministry. Christ
   died and rose again in the full vigor of early manhood and so continues
   to live in the memory of the church. The decline and weakness of old
   age is inconsistent with his position as the Renovator and Saviour of
   mankind.

   Irenaeus, otherwise (as a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of
   St. John) the most trustworthy witness of apostolic traditions among
   the fathers, held the untenable opinion that Christ attained to the
   ripe age of forty or fifty years and taught over ten years (beginning
   with the thirtieth), and that he thus passed through all the stages of
   human life, to save and sanctify "old men" as well as "infants and
   children and boys and youths." [141] He appeals for this view to
   tradition dating from St. John [142] and supports it by an unwarranted
   inference from the loose conjecture of the Jews when, surprised at the
   claim of Jesus to have existed before Abraham was born, they asked him:
   "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?" [143] A
   similar inference from another passage, where the Jews speak of the
   "forty-six years" since the temple of Herod began to be constructed,
   while Christ spoke of the, temple his body (John 2:20), is of course
   still less conclusive.

   IV. Duration of Christ's Public Ministry.--It began with the baptism by
   John and ended with the crucifixion. About the length of the
   intervening time there are (besides the isolated and decidedly
   erroneous view of Irenaeus) three theories, allowing respectively one,
   two, or three years and a few months, and designated as the bipaschal,
   tripaschal, and quadripaschal schemes, according to the number of
   Passovers. The Synoptists mention only the last Passover during the
   public ministry of our Lord, at which he was crucified, but they
   intimate that he was in Judaea more than once. [144] John certainly
   mentions three Passovers, two of which (the first and the last) Christ
   did attend, [145] and perhaps a fourth, which he also attended. [146]

   (1) The bipaschal scheme confines the public ministry to one year and a
   few weeks or months. This was first held by the Gnostic sect of the
   Valentinians (who connected it with their fancy about thirty aeons),
   and by several fathers, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian) and perhaps
   by Origen and Augustine (who express themselves doubtfully). The chief
   argument of the fathers and those harmonists who follow them, is
   derived from the prophecy of "the acceptable year of the Lord," as
   quoted by Christ, [147] and from the typical meaning of the paschal
   lamb, which must be of "one year" and without blemish. [148] Far more
   important is the argument drawn by some modern critics from the silence
   of the synoptical Gospels concerning the other Passovers. [149] But
   this silence is not in itself conclusive, and must yield to the
   positive testimony of John, which cannot be conformed to the bipaschal
   scheme. [150] Moreover, it is simply impossible to crowd the events of
   Christ's life, the training of the Twelve, and the development of the
   hostility of the Jews, into one short year.

   (2) The choice therefore lies between the tripaschal and the
   quadripaschal schemes. The decision depends chiefly on the
   interpretation of the unnamed "feast of the Jews," John 5:1, whether it
   was a Passover, or another feast; and this again depends much (though
   not exclusively) on a difference of reading (the feast, or a feast).
   [151] The parable of the barren fig-tree, which represents the Jewish
   people, has been used as an argument in favor of a three years'
   ministry: "Behold, these three year I come seeking fruit on this
   fig-tree, and find none." [152] The three years are certainly
   significant; but according to Jewish reckoning two and a half years
   would be called three years. More remote is the reference to the
   prophetic announcement of Daniel 9:27: "And he shall confirm the
   covenant with many for one week, and in the midst of the week he shall
   cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." The tripaschal theory
   is more easily reconciled with the synoptical Gospels, while the
   quadripaschal theory leaves more room for arranging the discourses and
   miracles of our Lord, and has been adopted by the majority of
   harmonists. [153]

   But even if we extend the public ministry to three years, it presents a
   disproportion between duration and effect without a parallel in history
   and inexplicable on purely natural grounds. In the language of an
   impartial historian, "the simple record of three short years of active
   life has done more to regenerate and soften mankind than all the
   disquisitions of philosophers and all the exhortations of moralists.
   This has indeed been the wellspring of whatever is best and purest in
   the Christian life." [154]

   V. The Date of the Lord's Death.--The day of the week on which Christ
   suffered on the cross was a Friday, [155] during the week of the
   Passover, in the month of Nisan, which was the first of the twelve
   lunar months of the Jewish year, and included the vernal equinox. But
   the question is whether this Friday was the 14th, or the 15th of Nisan,
   that is, the day before the feast or the first day of the feast, which
   lasted a week. The Synoptical Gospels clearly decide for the 15th, for
   they all say (independently) that our Lord partook of the paschal
   supper on the legal day, called the "first day of unleavened bread,"
   [156] that is on the evening of the 14th, or rather at the beginning of
   the 15th (the paschal lambs being slain "between the two evenings,"
   i.e. before and after sunset, between 3 and 5 p.m. of the 14th). [157]
   John, on the other hand, seems at first sight to point to the 14th, so
   that the death of our Lord would very nearly have coincided with the
   slaying of the paschal lamb. [158] But the three or four passages which
   look in that direction can, and on closer examination, must be
   harmonized with the Synoptical statement, which admits only of one
   natural interpretation. [159] It seems strange, indeed, that, the
   Jewish priests should have matured their bloody counsel in the solemn
   night of the Passover, and urged a crucifixion on a great festival, but
   it agrees, with the satanic wickedness of their crime. [160] Moreover
   it is on the other hand equally difficult to explain that they,
   together with the people, should have remained about the cross till
   late in the afternoon of the fourteenth, when, according to the law,
   they were to kill the paschal lamb and prepare for the feast; and that
   Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, with the pious women, should have
   buried the body of Jesus and so incurred defilement at that solemn
   hour.

   The view here advocated is strengthened by astronomical calculation,
   which shows that in a.d. 30 the probable year of the crucifixion, the
   15th of Nisan actually fell on a Friday (April 7);and this was the case
   only once more between the years a.d. 28 and 36, except perhaps also in
   33. Consequently Christ must have been Crucified a.d. 30. [161]

   To sum up the results, the following appear to us the most probable
   dates in the earthly life of our Lord:

   Birth a.u. 750 (Jan.?) or 749 (Dec.?) b.c. 4 or 5.

   Baptism a.u. 780 (Jan.?) a.d. 27.

   Length of Public Ministry

   (three years and three or

   four months) a.u. 780-783 a.d. 27-30.

   Crucifixion a.u. 783 (15th of Nisan) a.d. 30 (April 7)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [104] The fathers distinguish between the Nativity (genesis, Matt.
   1:18) and the Incarnation (sarkosis) and identify the Incarnation with
   the Conception or Annunciation. Since the time of Charlemagne the two
   terms seem to have been used synonymously. See Ideler, Chronol., ii.
   383, and Gieseler, i. 70 (4th Germ. ed.).

   [105] Jos., Antiqu., xvii. 8,1: "Herod died ... having reigned since he
   had procured Antigonus to be slain [a.u. 717, or B.C. 37], thirty-four
   years, but since he had been declared king by the Romans [a.u. 714, or
   B.C. 40], thirty-seven." Comp. the same statement in Bell. Jud., i. 33,
   8, and other passages.

   [106] According to Josephus, Antiqu. xvii. 6, 4: "And that night there
   was an eclipse of the moon." It is worthy of note that Josephus
   mentions no other eclipse in any of his works.

   [107] Matt. 2:16: pantas tous paidos ... apodietous kai katotero kata
   ton` chronon hon ekribosen para ton magon.

   [108] Tradition has here most absurdly swelled the number of Innocents
   to 20,000, as indicated on the massive column, which marks the spot of
   their supposed martyrdom in the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem. XX
   M[artyres], i.e. martyrs, have become XX M[ilia], i.e. twenty
   thousands.

   [109] Macrob., Sat., ii 4: "Augustus, cum audisset, inter pueros, quos
   in Syria Herodes, rex Judaeorum, intra bimatum [perhaps taken from
   Matt. 2:16, Vulg.: a bimatu et infra]jussit interfici, filium quoque
   eius occisum, ait: melius est Herodis porcum esse quam filium." It is a
   pun on the similar sounding Greek terms for sow and son (hus and
   huios). Kepler already quoted thispassage in confirmation of Matthew.

   [110] Tacitus (Hist., v. 13) and Suetonius (Vespas., c. 4) speak of a
   widespread expectation of that kind at the time of the Jewish war and
   before (Suetonius calls it a vetus et constans opinio), but falsely
   refer it to the Roman emperors Vespasianus and Titus. In this the
   heathen historians followed Josephus, who well knew and believed the
   Messianic hopes of his people (comp. Ant., iv. 6, 5; x. 10, 4; 11, 7),
   and yet was not ashamed basely to betray and pervert them, saying
   (Bell. Jud. vi. 5, 4): "What did the most to elevate the Jews in
   undertaking this war, was an ambiguous oracle that was found also in
   their sacred writings, how 'about that time, one from their country
   should become governor of the habitable earth.' The Jews took this
   prediction to belong to themselves in particular, and many of the wise
   men were thereby deceived in their determination. Now, this oracle
   certainly denoted the goverment of Vespasian, who was appointed emperor
   in Judaea." Comp. Hausrath, N.T. Ztgesch., I. 173. The Messianic hopes
   continued long after the destruction of Jerusalem. The false Messiah,
   who led the rebellion under the reign of Hadrian (a.d. 135), called
   himself Bar-Cochba, i.e. "Son of the Star," and issued coins with a
   star, in allusion probably to Num. 24:17. When his real character was
   revealed, his name was turned into Bar-Cosiba, "Son of Falsehood."

   [111] In the beginning of his Bericht vom Geburtsjahr Christi (Opera,
   IV. 204) he describes this new star in these words: "Einungewöhnlicher,
   sehr heller und schöner Stern ... der wie die schönste, herrlichste
   Fackel so jemahl mit Augen gesehen worden, wenn sie von einem starken
   Wind getrieben wird, geflammet und gefunkelt, gerad neben den drey
   höchsten Planeten Saturno, Jove und Marte." He calls this phenomenon
   "ein überaus grosses Wunderwerk Gottes." A fuller description of the
   whole phenomenon he gives in his work De Stella Nova (Opera, II. 575
   sqq. and 801 sqq., ed. Frisch). Upham (The Wise Men, N. Y. 1869, p.
   145) says: "Tycho de Brahe had observed a similar wonder in the
   constellation Cassiopeia, on the night of the 11th of October, in the
   year 1572. These were not luminous bodies within our atmosphere; were
   not within, or near, the solar system; they were in the region of the
   fixed stars. Each grew more and more brilliant, till it shone like a
   planet. Then its lustre waned until it ceased to be visible,--the one
   in March, 1574, the other in February, 1606. The light was white, then
   yellow, then red, then dull, and so went out." On temporary stars, see
   Herschel's Astronomy, Chap. XII.

   [112] The learned Jewish Rabbi Abarbanel, in his Commentary on Daniel
   (called Ma'jne hajeshuah, i.e."Wells of Salvation,"Isa. 12:3), which
   was published 1547, more than fifty years before Kepler's calculation,
   says that such a conjunction took place three years before the birth of
   Moses (a.m. 2365), and would reappear before the birth of the Messiah,
   a.m. 5224 (or a.d. 1463). Ideler and Wieseler conjecture that this
   astrological belief existed among the Jews already at the time of
   Christ.

   [113] It has been so accepted by Dean Alford and others. See the note
   in 6th ed. of his Com. on Matt. 2:2 (1868), with the corrections
   furnished by Rev. C. Pritchard. McClellan (New Test., I, 402) assumes
   that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn was premonitory and
   coincided with the conception of the birth of John the Baptist, Oct.
   748, and that Kepler's new star was Messiah's star appearing a year
   later.

   [114] Comp. Num. 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47.

   [115] In the new revision the passage, Luke 3:1, 2, is thus translated:
   "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign (hegemonias) of Tiberius
   Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor (hegemoneuontos) of Judaea, and
   Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the
   region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in
   the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto
   John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness." The statement must have
   been quite intelligible to the educated readers of that time.

   [116] The different interpretations of autos hen archomenos hosei eton
   triakonta do not alter the result much, but the hosei leaves a margin
   for a few months more or less. Comp. McClellan, I. 404.

   [117] He uses the same term of Pontius Pilate (hegemoneuontos). Zumpt,
   l.c. p. 296, says: "Eigentlich verstanden, bezeichnet hegemonia die
   Würde des militärischen Befehlshabers und des Regenten über die
   Provinzen. Hätte Lucas 'Augustus Kaiser' (autokrator) oder auch nur
   'Herrscher' (archon) gesagt, so würde man an eine Zählung von Tiberius'
   Provincialverwaltung weniger denken können .

   [118] Different modes of counting were not unusual, regarding the early
   Roman emperors, and Herod I. See above, p. 112, Zumpt, l. c. 282 sqq.,
   and Andrews, p. 27. Suetonius (Tib., 33) and Tacitus (Annal., vi. 51)
   say that Tiberius died in the 23d year of his reign, meaning his sole
   reign; but there are indications also of the other counting, at least
   in Egypt and the provinces, where the authority of Tiberius as the
   active emperor was more felt than in Rome. There are coins from Antioch
   in Syria of the date a.u. 765, with the head of Tiberius and the
   inscription, Kaisar. Sebastos (Augustus). In favor of the computation
   from the colleagueship are Ussher, Bengel, Lardner, Greswell, Andrews,
   Zumpt, Wieseler, McClellan; in favor of the computation from the sole
   reign are Lightfoot, Ewald. Browne. Wieseler formerly held that Luke
   refers to the imprisonment, and not the beginning of the ministry, of
   John, but he changed his view; see his art. in Herzog's " Encykl.,"xxi.
   547.

   [119] Andrews,l. c. p. 28, thus sums up his investigations upon this
   point: "We find three solutions of the chronological difficulties which
   the statements of Luke present: 1st. That the 15th year of Tiberius is
   to be reckoned from the death ot Augustus, and extends from August,
   781, to August, 782. In this year the Baptist, whose labors began some
   time previous, was imprisoned; but the Lord's ministry began in 780,
   before this imprisonment, and when he was about thirty years of age.
   2d. That the 15th year is to be reckoned from the death of Augustus,
   but that the statement, the Lord was about thirty years of age, is to
   be taken in a large sense, and that he may have been of any age from
   thirty to thirty-five when he began he labors. 3d. That the 15th year
   is to be reckoned from the year when Tiberius was associated with
   Augustus in the empire, and is therefore the year 779. In this case the
   language, 'he was about thirty,' may be strictly taken, and the
   statement, 'the word of God came unto John,' may be referred to the
   beginning of his ministry."

   [120] Hase (Gesch. Jesu, p. 209) strangely defends the Dionysian era,
   but sacrifices the date of Matthew, together with the whole history of
   the childhood of Jesus. Against the view of Keim see Schürer, p. 242.

   [121] See the literature till 1874 in Schürer, p. 262, who devotes 24
   pages to this subject. The most important writers on the census of
   Quirinius are Huschke (a learned jurist, in 2 treatises, 1840 and
   1847), Wieseler (1843 and 1869), and Zumpt (1854 and 1869). Comp, also
   the article "Taxing," by Dr. Plumptre, supplemented by Dr. Woolsey, in
   Smith's "Bible Dictionary" (Hackett and Abbot's ed.), IV. 3185, and J.
   B. McClellan, New Test., I. 392.

   [122] This is the proper meaning of the original (according to the last
   text of Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, who with B D omit the article
   he) aute apographe prote egeneto hegemoneuontos tes Surias
   Kureniou-b.-b Vulg.:Haec descriptio prima facta est a praeside Syriae
   Cyrino.The English version, " this taxing was first made when,"is
   ungrammatical, and would require proton, or, prota instead of prote.
   Luke either meant to say that there was no previous enrolment in Judea,
   or, more probably had in his mind a second enrolment made under
   Quirinius at his second governorship, which is noticed by him in Acts
   5:37, and was well known to his readers. See below. Quirinius
   (Kurenios) is the proper spelling (Strabo, Josephus, Tacitus, Justin
   M)--not Quirinus, which was also a Roman name; hence the confusion.
   (See Weiss, in the 6th ed. of Meyer on Luke, p. 286.) His full name was
   Publius Sulpicius Quirinius (Tacitus, Annal., iii 48; Suetonius,
   Tiber., 49). He was consul a.u. 742, at the head of an army in Africa,
   747, and died in Rome, a.d. 21. Josephus speaks of him at the beginning
   of the 18th book of his Archael. See, a full account of him in Zumpt,
   pp. 43-71.

   [123] Ulpian, quoted by Zumpt, Geburtsjahr Christi, p. 203 sq.

   [124] Josephus, Antiqu., xvii. 13, 5; xviii. 1, 1. The census here
   referred to is evidently the same which Luke means in Acts 5:37: "After
   this man arose Judas the Galilaean in the days of the enrolment."
   Josephus calls him "Judas, a Gaulanite," because he was of Gamala in
   lower Gaulanitis; but in Ant., xx. 5, 2, and Bell. Jud., ii. 8, 1, he
   calls him likewise a Galilaean. In this case, then, Luke is entirely
   correct, and it is extremely improbable that a writer otherwise so well
   informed as Luke should have confounded two enrolments which were ten
   years apart.

   [125] The usual solution of the difficulty is to give prote the sense
   of protera before Quirinius was governor; as protos tinos is used
   (though not in connection with a participle) in the sense of prior to,
   John 1:15, 30; 15:18. So Ussher, Huschke, Tholuck, Wieseler, Caspari,
   Ewald. But this would have been more naturally and clearly expressed by
   prin or pro tou hegemeneuein (as in Luke 2:21; 12:15; Acts 23:15).
   Paulus, Ebrard, Lange, Godet, and others accentuate aute (ipsa) and
   explain: The decree of the census was issued at the time of Christ's
   birth, but the so-called first census itself did not take place till
   the governorship of Quirinius (ten years later). Impossible on account
   of Lk 2:3, which reports the execution of the decree, Lk 2:1. Browne
   (p. 46) and others understand hegemoneuein in a wider sense, so as to
   include an extraordinary commission of Quirinius as legatus Caesaris.

   [126] Annal., iii. 48, as interpreted by A. W. Zumpt in a Latin
   dissertation: De Syria Romanorum provincia ab Caesare Augusto ad T.
   Vespasianum, in Comment. Epigraph., Berol. 1854, vol. ii. 88-125, and
   approved by Mommsen in Res gesstae divi Augusti, 121-124. Zumpt has
   developed his views more fully in Das Geburtsjahr Christi, 1869, pp.
   1-90. Ussher, Sanclemente, Ideler (II. 397), and Browne (p. 46) had
   understood Tacitus in the same way.

   [127] First published at Florence, 1765, then by Sanclemente (De vulg.
   aerae Emendat. Rom. 1793), and more correctly by Bergmann and Mommsen:
   De inscriptione Latina, ad P. Sulpicium Quirinium referenda, Berol.
   1851. Mommsen discussed it again in an appendix to Res gestae Augusti,
   Berol. 1865, pp. 111-126. The inscription is defective, and reads: "...
   Pro. Consul. Asiam. Provinciam. Op[tinuit legatus]. Divi.
   Augusti[i]terum i.e., again, a second time]. Syriam. Et. Ph[oenicem
   administravit, or, obtinuit]. The name is obliterated. Zumpt refers it
   to C. Sentius Saturninus (who preceded Quirinius, but is not known to
   have been twice governor of Syria), Bergmann, Mommsen, and Merivale to
   Quirinius (as was done by Sanclemente in 1793, and by Ideler, 1826).
   Nevertheless Mommsen denies any favorable bearing of the discovery on
   the solution of the difficulty in Luke, while Zumpt defends the
   substantial accuracy of the evangelist.

   [128] Josephus, Antiqu., xvii. 11, 1; Tacitus, Hist., v. 9: "post
   mortem Herodis ... Simo quidam regium nomen invaserat; is a Quintilio
   Vare obtinento Syriam punitus," etc.

   [129] Three censuses, held a.u. 726, 748, and 767, are mentioned on the
   monument of Ancyra; one in Italy, 757, by Dion Cassius; others in Gaul
   are assigned to 727, 741, 767; Tertullian, who was a learned lawyer,
   speaks of one in Judaea under Sentius Saturninus, a.u. 749; and this
   would be the one which must be meant by Luke. See Gruter, Huschke,
   Zumpt, Plumptre, l. c.

   [130] Suetonius, Aug. 28, 101; Tacitus, Annal., i. 11; Dio Cassius,
   lii. 30; Ivi. 33. The breviarium contained, according to Tacitus: "opes
   publicae quantum civium sociorumque in armis [which would include
   Herod], quot classes, regna, provinciae, tributa aut vectigalia, et
   necessitates ac largitiones. Quae cuncta sua manu perscripserat
   Augustus, addideratque consilium coërcendi intra terminos imperii,
   incertum metu anper invidiam"

   [131] Joseph. Ant. xvi. 9, § 4. Comp. Marquardt, Röm. Staatsverwaltung,
   I.249.

   [132] Such a decree has been often inferred from the passages of
   Suetonius and Tacitus just quoted. The silence of Josephus is not very
   difficult to explain, for he does not profess to give a history of the
   empire, is nearly silent on the period from a.u. 750-760, and is not as
   impartial a historian as Luke, nor worthy of more credit. Cassiodorus
   (Variarum, iii. 52) and Suidas (s. v., apographe) expressly assert the
   fact of a general census, and add several particulars which are not
   derived from Luke; e.g. Suidas says that Augustus elected twenty
   commissioners of high character and sent them to all parts of the
   empire to collect statistics of population as well as of property, and
   to return a portion to the national treasury. Hence Huschke, Wieseler,
   Zumpt, Plumptre, and McClellan accept their testimony as historically
   correct (while Schürer derives it simply from Luke, without being able
   to account for these particulars). Wieseler quotes also John Malala,
   the historian of Antioch, as saying, probablyon earlier authorities,
   that "Augustus, in the 39th year and 10th month of his reign [i.e. B.C.
   5 or 6] issued a decree for a general registration throughout the
   empire." Julius Caesar had begun a measurement of the whole empire, and
   Augustus completed it.

   [133] Not to be confounded with L. Volusius Saturninus, who is known,
   from coins, to have been governor of Syria a.u. 758 (a.d. 4).

   [134] Adv. Marc. iv. 19: "Sed et census constat actos sub Augusto tunc
   in Judaea per Sentium Saturninum, apud quos genus ejus inquirere
   potuissent."

   [135] Zumpt, the classical scholar and archaeologist, concludes (p.
   223) that there is nothing in Luke's account which does not receive,
   from modern research,"full historical probability" ("volle historische
   Wahrscheinlichkeit"); while Schürer, the theologian, still doubts
   (Matt. 28:17). Dr. Woolsey (s. v."Cyrenius," in "Smith's Bible Dict.,"
   Hackett and Abbot's ed., p. 526), decides that "something is gained."
   In the art. "Taxing" he says that a registration of Judaea made under
   the direction of the president of Syria by Jewish officers would not
   greatly differ from a similar registration made by Herod, and need not
   have alarmed the Jews if carefully managed.

   [136] Antiqu. xv. 11, 1: "And now Herod, in the eighteenth year of his
   reign (oktokaidekaton tes Herodon basileias eniautou) ... undertook a
   very great work, that is, to build of himself the temple of God, and to
   raise it to a most magnificent altitude, as esteeming it to be the most
   glorious of all his actions, as it really was, to bring it to
   perfection, and that this would be sufficient for an everlasting
   memorial of him."

   [138] Adv. Jud. c. 8: "Huius [Tiberii] quinto decimo anno imperii
   passus est Christus, annos habens quasi triginta, cum pateretur ....
   Quae passio huius exterminii intra tempora LXX hebdomadarum perfecta
   est sub Tiberio Caesare, Consulibus Rubellio Gemino Et Fufio Gemino,
   mense Martio, temporibus paschae, die VIII Kalendarum Aprilium, die
   prima azymorum, quo agnum occiderunt ad vesperam, sicuti a Moyse fuerat
   praeceptum." Lactantius(De Mort. Persec. 2; De Vera Sap. 10) and
   Augustine make the same statement (De Civit. Dei, I xviii. c. 54:
   "Mortuus est Christus duobus Geminis Consulibus, octavo Kalendas
   Aprilis "). Zumpt assigns much weight to this tradition, pp. 268 sqq.

   [139] As in Switzerland the herds are driven to the mountain pastures
   in May and brought home in August or September.

   [140] The latest learned advocate of the traditional date is John Brown
   McClellan, who tries to prove that Christ was born Dec. 25, a.u. 749
   (B.C. 5). See his New Test., etc. vol. I. 390 sqq.

   [142] This shows conclusively how uncertain patristic traditions are as
   to mere facts.

   [143] John 8:57. Irenaeus reasons that the Jews made the nearest
   approach to the real age, either from mere observation or from
   knowledge of the public records, and thus concludes: "Christ did not
   therefore preach only for one year, nor did he suffer in the twelfth
   month of the year; for the period included between the thirtieth and
   the fiftieth year can never be regarded as one year, unless indeed,
   among their aeons [he speaks of the Gnostics] there be such long years
   assigned to those who sit in their ranks with Bythos in thePleroma."

   [150] Henry Browne who, in his Ordo Saeclorum (pp.80 sqq.), likewise
   defends the one year's ministry, in part by astronomical calculations,
   is constrained to eliminate without any MSS. authority to `pascha from
   John 6:4, and to make the heorte there mentioned to be the same as that
   in 7:2, so that John would give the feasts of one year only, in regular
   chronological order, namely, the Passover 2:13 in March, the Pentecost
   5:1 in May, the Feast of Tabernacles 6:4; 7:2 in September, the Feast
   of Dedication 10:22 in December, the Passover of the Crucifixion in
   March.

   [151] The definite article before "feast, (he heorte ) which is
   supported by the Sinaitic MS. and adopted by Tischendorf (ed. viii.),
   favors the view that the feast was the Passover,the great feast of the
   Jews. The reading without the article, which has the weight of the more
   critical Vatican Ms, and is preferred by Lachmann, Tregelles, Westcott
   and Hort, and by the Revision of the E. V., favors the view that it was
   Pentecost, or Purim, or some other subordinate feast. (On the
   grammatical question comp. Thayer's Winer, p. 125, and Moulton's Winer,
   p. 155.) In all other passages John gives the name of the feast (to
   pascha John 2:13; 6:4; 11:55; he skenopegia 7:2; ta enkainia 10:22). It
   is objected that Jesus would not be likely to attend the patriotic and
   secular feast of Purim, which was not a temple feast and required no
   journey to Jerusalem, while he omitted the next Passover (John 6:4)
   which was of divine appointment and much more solemn; but the objection
   is not conclusive, since he attended other minor festivals (John 7:2;
   10:22) merely for the purpose of doing good.

   says (on Isaiah 29, in Migne's ed. of the Opera, IV. 330): "Scriptum

   14th and the evening of the 15th of Nisan, we should have twenty-four
   hours for the slaying and eating of the paschal lambs, and the whole
   difficulty between John and the Synoptists would disappear. We could
   easier conceive also the enormous number of 270,000 lambs which,
   according to the statement of Josephus, had to be sacrificed. But that
   interpretation is excluded by the fact that the same expression is used
   in the rules about the daily evening sacrifice (Ex. 29:39, 41; Num.
   28:4).

   [158] John 13:1; 13:29; 18:28 19:14.

   [159] John 13:1 "before the feast of the Passover" does not mean a day
   before (which would have been so expressed, comp, 12:1), but a short
   time before, and refers to the commencement of the 15th of Nisan. The
   passage, 13:29: "Buy what things we have need of for the feast," causes
   no difficulty if we remember that Jesus sat down with his disciples
   before the regular hour of the Passover (13:1), so that there was time
   yet for the necessary purchases. The passage on the contrary affords a
   strong argument against the supposition that the supper described by
   John took place a full day before the Passover; for then there would
   have been no need of such haste for purchases as the apostles
   understood Christ to mean when he said to Judas."That thou doest, do
   quickly" (13:27). In John 18:28 it is said that the Jews went not into
   the Praetorium of the heathen Pilate "that they might not be defiled,
   but might eat the Passover; " but this was said early in the morning,
   at about 3 A. M., when the regular paschal meal was not yet finished in
   the city; others take the word Passover "here in an unusual sense so as
   to embrace the chagigah ( chgygh) or festive thank-offerings during the
   Passover week, especially on the fifteenth day of Nisan (comp. 2 Chr.
   30:22); at all events it cannot apply to the paschal supper on the
   evening of the fifteenth of Nisan, for the defilement would have ceased
   after sunset, and could therefore have been no bar to eating the
   paschal supper (Lev. 15:1-18; 22:1-7). " The Preparation of the
   Passover,"he paraskeue tou pascha, John 19:14, is not the day preceding
   the Passover (Passover Eve), but, as clearly in 19:31 and 42, the
   preparation day of the Passover week, i.e. the Paschal Friday;
   paraskeue being the technical term for Friday as the preparation day
   for the Sabbath, the fore-Sabbath, prosabbaton, Mark 15:42 (comp. the
   German Sonnabend for Saturday, Sabbath-eve, etc.). For a fuller
   examination of the respective passages, see my edition of Lange on
   Matthew (pp. 454 sqq.), and on John (pp. 406, 415, 562, 569).
   Lightfoot, Wieseler, Lichtenstein, Hengstenberg, Ebrard (in the third
   ed. of his Kritik. 1868), Lange, Kirchner, Keil, Robinson, Andrews,
   Milligan, Plumptre and McClellan take the same view; while Lücke,
   Bleek, DeWette, Meyer, Ewald, Stier, Beyschlag, Greswell, Ellicott,
   Farrar, Mansel and Westcott maintain that Christ was crucified on the
   fourteenth of Nisan, and either assume a contradiction between John and
   the Synoptists (which in this case seems quite impossible), or transfer
   the paschal supper of Christ to the preceding day, contrary to law and
   custom. John himself clearly points to the fifteenth of Nisan as the
   day of the crucifixion, when he reports that the customary release of a
   prisoner " at the Passover"(en to pascha) was granted by Pilate on the
   day of crucifixion, John 18:39, 40. The critical and cautious Dr.
   Robinson says (Harmony, p. 222): " After repeated and calm
   consideration, there rests upon my own mind a clear conviction, that
   there is nothing in the language of John, or in the attendant
   circumstances, which upon fair interpretation requires or permits us to
   believe, that the beloved disciple either intended to correct, or has
   in fact corrected or contradicted, the explicit and unquestionable
   testimony of Matthew, Mark and Luke."Comp. also among the more recent
   discussions Mor. Kirchner: Die jüd. Passahfeier und Jesu letztes Mahl
   (Gotha, 1870); McClellan: N. Test. (1875), I. 473 sqq., 482 sqq.; Keil:
   Evang. des Matt. (Leipz. 1877), pp. 513 sqq.

   [160] The answer to this objection is well presented by Dr. Robinson,
   Harmony p. 222, and Keil, Evang. des Matt., pp. 522 sqq. The Mishna
   prescribes that "on Sabbaths and festival days no trial or judgment may
   be held;" but on the other hand it contains directions and regulations
   for the meetings and actions of the Sanhedrin on the Sabbaths, and
   executions of criminals were purposely reserved to great festivals for
   the sake of stronger example. In our case, the Sanhedrin on the day
   after the crucifixion, which was a Sabbath and "a great day," applied
   to Pilate for a watch and caused the sepulchre to be sealed, Matt.

   and full moons by Prof. Adams, in McClellan, I. 493, who devoutly
   exults in the result of the crucial test of astronomical calculation
   which makes the very heavens, after the roll of centuries, bear witness
   to the harmony of the Gospels.

   Literature.

   I. The geographical and descriptive works on the Holy Land by Reland
   (1714), Robinson (1838 and 1856), Ritter (1850-1855), Raumer (4th ed.
   1860), Tobler (several monographs from 1849 to 1869), W. M. Thomson
   (revised ed. 1880), Stanley (1853, 6th ed. 1866), Tristram (1864),
   Schaff (1878; enlarged ed. 1889), Guérin (1869, 1875, 1880).

   See Tobler's Bibliographia geographica Palaestinae (Leipz. 1867) and
   the supplementary lists of more recent works by Ph. Wolff in the
   "Jahrbücher für deutsche Theologie, " 1868 and 1872, and by Socin in
   the "Zeitschrift des deutschen Palaestina-Vereins," 1878, p. 40, etc.

   II. The "Histories of New Testament Times" (Neutestamentliche
   Zeitgeschichte, a special department of historical theology recently
   introduced), by Schneckburger (1862), Hausrath (1868 sqq.), and Schürer
   (1874).

   See Lit. in § 8, p. 56.

   There is a wonderful harmony between the life of our Lord as described
   by the Evangelists, and his geographical and historical environment as
   known to us from contemporary writers, and illustrated and confirmed by
   modern discovery and research. This harmony contributes not a little to
   the credibility of the gospel history. The more we come to understand
   the age and country in which Jesus lived, the more we feel, in reading
   the Gospels, that we are treading on the solid ground of real history
   illuminated by the highest revelation from heaven. The poetry of the
   canonical Gospels, if we may so call their prose, which in spiritual
   beauty excels all poetry, is not (like that of the Apocryphal Gospels)
   the poetry of human fiction--"no fable old, no mythic lore, nor dream
   of bards and seers;" it is the poetry of revealed truth, the poetry of
   the sublimest facts the poetry of the infinite wisdom and love of God
   which, ever before had entered the imagination of man, but which
   assumed human flesh and blood in Jesus of Nazareth and solved through
   his life and work the deepest problem of our existence.

   The stationary character of Oriental countries and peoples enables us
   to infer from their present aspect and condition what they were two
   thousand years ago. And in this we are aided by the multiplying
   discoveries which make even stones and mummies eloquent witnesses of
   the past. Monumental evidence appeals to the senses and overrules the
   critical conjectures and combinations of unbelieving skepticism,
   however ingenious and acute they may be. Who will doubt the history of
   the Pharaohs when it can be read in the pyramids and sphinxes, in the
   ruins of temples and rock-tombs, in hieroglyphic inscriptions and
   papyrus rolls which antedate the founding of Rome and the exodus of
   Moses and the Israelites? Who will deny the biblical records of Babylon
   and Nineveh after these cities have risen from the grave of centuries
   to tell their own story through cuneiform inscriptions, eagle-winged
   lions and human-headed bulls, ruins of temples and palaces disentombed
   from beneath the earth? We might as well erase Palestine from the map
   and remove it to fairy-land, as to blot out the Old and New Testament
   from history and resolve them into airy myths and legends. [162]

   The Land.

   Jesus spent his life in Palestine. It is a country of about the size of
   Maryland, smaller than Switzerland, and not half as large as Scotland,
   [163] but favored with a healthy climate, beautiful scenery, and great
   variety and fertility of soil, capable of producing fruits of all lands
   from the snowy north to the tropical south; isolated from other
   countries by desert, mountain and sea, yet lying in the centre of the
   three continents of the eastern hemisphere and bordering on the
   Mediterranean highway of the historic nations of antiquity, and
   therefore providentially adapted to develop not only the particularism
   of Judaism, but also the universalism of Christianity. From little
   Phoenicia the world has derived the alphabet, from little Greece
   philosophy and art, from little Palestine the best of all--the true
   religion and the cosmopolitan Bible. Jesus could not have been born at
   any other time than in the reign of Caesar Augustus, after the Jewish
   religion, the Greek civilization, and the Roman government had reached
   their maturity; nor in any other land than Palestine, the classical
   soil of revelation, nor among any other people than the Jews, who were
   predestinated and educated for centuries to prepare the way for the
   coming of the Messiah and the fulfilment of the law and the prophets.
   In his infancy, a fugitive from the wrath of Herod, He passed through
   the Desert (probably by the short route along the Mediterranean coast)
   to Egypt and back again; and often may his mother have spoken to him of
   their brief sojourn in "the land of bondage," out of which Jehovah had
   led his people, by the mighty arm of Moses, across the Red Sea and
   through "the great and terrible wilderness" into the land of promise.
   During his forty days of fasting "in the wilderness" he was, perhaps,
   on Mount Sinai communing with the spirits of Moses and Elijah, and
   preparing himself in the awfully eloquent silence of that region for
   the personal conflict with the Tempter of the human race, and for the
   new legislation of liberty from the Mount of Beatitudes. [164] Thus the
   three lands of the Bible, Egypt, the cradle of Israel, the Desert, its
   school and playground, and Canaan, its final home, were touched and
   consecrated by "those blessed feet which, eighteen centuries ago, were
   nailed for our advantage on the bitter cross."

   He travelled on his mission of love through Judaea, Samaria, Galilee,
   and Peraea; he came as far north as mount Hermon, and once he crossed
   beyond the land of Israel to the Phoenician border and healed the
   demonized daughter of that heathen mother to whom he said, "O woman,
   great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt."

   We can easily follow him from place to place, on foot or on horseback,
   twenty or thirty miles a day, over green fields and barren rocks over
   hill and dale among flowers and thistles, under olive and fig-trees,
   pitching our tent for the night's rest, ignoring the comforts of modern
   civilization, but delighting in the unfading beauties of God's nature,
   reminded at every step of his wonderful dealings with his people, and
   singing the psalms of his servants of old.

   We may kneel at his manger in Bethlehem, the town of Judaea where Jacob
   buried his beloved Rachel, and a pillar, now a white mosque, marks her
   grave; where Ruth was rewarded for her filial devotion, and children
   may still be seen gleaning after the reapers in the grainfields, as she
   did in the field of Boaz; where his ancestor, the poet-king, was born
   and called from his father's flocks to the throne of Israel; where
   shepherds are still watching the sheep as in that solemn night when the
   angelic host thrilled their hearts with the heavenly anthem of glory to
   God, and peace on earth to men of his good pleasure; where the sages
   from the far East offered their sacrifices in the name of future
   generations of heathen converts; where Christian gratitude has erected
   the oldest church in Christendom, the "Church of the Nativity," and
   inscribed on the solid rock in the "Holy Crypt," in letters of silver,
   the simple but pregnant inscription: "Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus
   Christus natus est." When all the surroundings correspond with the
   Scripture narrative, it is of small account whether the traditional
   grotto of the Nativity is the identical spot--though pointed out as
   such it would seem already in the middle of the second century. [165]

   We accompany him in a three days' journey from Bethlehem to Nazareth,
   his proper home, where he spent thirty silent years of his life in
   quiet preparation for his public work, unknown in his divine character
   to his neighbors and even the members of his own household (John 7:5),
   except his saintly parents. Nazareth is still there, a secluded, but
   charmingly located mountain village, with narrow, crooked and dirty
   streets, with primitive stone houses where men, donkeys and camels are
   huddled together, surrounded by cactus hedges and fruitful gardens of
   vines, olive, fig, and pomegranates, and favorably distinguished from
   the wretched villages of modern Palestine by comparative industry,
   thrift, and female beauty; the never failing "Virgin's Fountain,"
   whither Jesus must often have accompanied his mother for the daily
   supply of water, is still there near the Greek Church of the
   Annunciation, and is the evening rendezvous of the women and maidens,
   with their water-jars gracefully poised on the head or shoulder, and a
   row of silver coins adorning their forehead; and behind the village
   still rises the hill, fragrant with heather and thyme, from which he
   may often have cast his eye eastward to Gilboa, where Jonathan fell,
   and to the graceful, cone-like Tabor--the Righi of Palestine--northward
   to the lofty Mount Hermon--the Mont Blanc of Palestine--southward to
   the fertile plain of Esdraëlon--the classic battle-ground of
   Israel--and westward to the ridge of Carmel, the coast of Tyre and
   Sidon and the blue waters of the Mediterranean sea--the future highway
   of his gospel of peace to mankind. There he could feast upon the rich
   memories of David and Jonathan, Elijah and Elisha, and gather images of
   beauty for his lessons of wisdom. We can afford to smile at the silly
   superstition which points out the kitchen of the Virgin Mary beneath
   the Latin Church of the Annunciation, the suspended column where she
   received the angel's message, the carpenter shop of Joseph and Jesus,
   the synagogue in which he preached on the acceptable year of the Lord,
   the stone table at which he ate with his disciples, the Mount of
   Precipitation two miles off, and the stupendous monstrosity of the
   removal of the dwelling-house of Mary by angels in the air across the
   sea to Loretto in Italy! These are childish fables, in striking
   contrast with the modest silence of the Gospels, and neutralized by the
   rival traditions of Greek and Latin monks; but nature in its beauty is
   still the same as Jesus saw and interpreted it in his incomparable
   parables, which point from nature to nature's God and from visible
   symbols to eternal truths. [166]

   Jesus was inaugurated into his public ministry by his baptism in the
   fast-flowing river Jordan, which connects the Old and New Covenant. The
   traditional spot, a few miles from Jericho, is still visited by
   thousands of Christian pilgrims from all parts of the world at the
   Easter season, who repeat the spectacle of the multitudinous baptisms
   of John, when the people came "from Jerusalem and all Judaea and all
   the region round about the Jordan" to confess their sins and to receive
   his water-baptism of repentance.

   The ruins of Jacob's well still mark the spot where Jesus sat down
   weary of travel, but not of his work of mercy and opened to the poor
   woman of Samaria the well of the water of life and instructed her in
   the true spiritual worship of God; and the surrounding landscape, Mount
   Gerizim, and Mount Ebal, the town of Shechem, the grain-fields
   whitening to the harvest, all illustrate and confirm the narrative in
   the fourth chapter of John; while the fossil remnant of the Samaritans
   at Nablous (the modern Shechem) still perpetuates the memory of the
   paschal sacrifice according to the Mosaic prescription, and their
   traditional hatred of the Jews.

   We proceed northward to Galilee where Jesus spent the most popular part
   of his public ministry and spoke so many of his undying words of wisdom
   and love to the astonished multitudes. That province was once thickly
   covered with forests, cultivated fields, plants and trees of different
   climes, prosperous villages and an industrious population. [167] The
   rejection of the Messiah and the Moslem invasion have long since turned
   that paradise of nature into a desolate wilderness, yet could not
   efface the holy memories and the illustrations of the gospel history.
   There is the lake with its clear blue waters, once whitened with ships
   sailing from shore to shore, and the scene of a naval battle between
   the Romans and the Jews, now utterly forsaken, but still abounding in
   fish, and subject to sudden violent storms, such as the one which Jesus
   commanded to cease; there are the hills from which he proclaimed the
   Sermon on the Mount, the Magna Charta of his kingdom, and to which he
   often retired for prayer; there on the western shore is the plain of
   Gennesaret, which still exhibits its natural fertility by the luxuriant
   growth of briers and thistles and the bright red magnolias overtopping
   them; there is the dirty city of Tiberias, built by Herod Antipas,
   where Jewish rabbis still scrupulously search the letter of the
   Scriptures without finding Christ in them; a few wretched Moslem huts
   called Mejdel still indicate the birth-place of Mary Magdalene, whose
   penitential tears and resurrection joys are a precious legacy of
   Christendom. And although the cities of Capernaum, Bethsaida and
   Chorazim, "where most of his mighty works were done" have utterly
   disappeared from the face of the earth, and their very sites are
   disputed among scholars, thus verifying to the letter the fearful
   prophecy of the Son of Man, [168] yet the ruins of Tell Hum and Kerazeh
   bear their eloquent testimony to the judgment of God for neglected
   privileges, and the broken columns and friezes with a pot of manna at
   Tell Hum are probably the remains of the very synagogue which the good
   Roman centurion built for the people of Capernaum, and in which Christ
   delivered his wonderful discourse on the bread of life from heaven.
   [169]

   Caesarea Philippi, formerly and now called Banias (or Paneas, Paneion,
   from the heathen sanctuary of Pan), at the foot of Hermon, marks the
   northern termination of the Holy Land and of the travels of the Lord,
   and the boundary-line between the Jews and the Gentiles; and that
   Swiss-like, picturesque landscape, the most beautiful in Palestine, in
   full view of the fresh, gushing source of the Jordan, and at the foot
   of the snow-crowned monarch of Syrian mountains seated on a throne of
   rock, seems to give additional force to Peter's fundamental confession
   and Christ's prophecy of his Church universal built upon the immovable
   rock of his eternal divinity.

   The closing scenes of the earthly life of our Lord and the beginning of
   his heavenly life took place in Jerusalem and the immediate
   neighborhood, where every spot calls to mind the most important events
   that ever occurred or can occur in this world. Jerusalem, often
   besieged and destroyed, and as often rebuilt "on her own heap," is
   indeed no more the Jerusalem of Herod, which lies buried many feet
   beneath the rubbish and filth of centuries; even the site of Calvary is
   disputed, and superstition has sadly disfigured and obscured the
   historic associations. [170] "Christ is not there, He is risen." [171]
   There is no more melancholy sight in the world than the present
   Jerusalem as contrasted with its former glory, and with the teeming
   life of Western cities; and yet so many are the sacred memories
   clustering around it and perfuming the very air, that even Rome must
   yield the palm of interest to the city which witnessed the crucifixion
   and the resurrection. The Herodian temple on Mount Moriah, once the
   gathering place of pious Jews from all the earth, and enriched with
   treasures of gold and silver which excited the avarice of the
   conquerors, has wholly disappeared, and "not one stone is left upon
   another," in literal fulfilment of Christ's prophecy; [172] but the
   massive foundations of Solomon's structure around the temple area still
   bear the marks of the Phoenician workmen; the "wall of wailing" is
   moistened with the tears of the Jews who assemble there every Friday to
   mourn over the sins and misfortunes of their forefathers; and if we
   look down from Mount Olivet upon Mount Moriah and the Moslem Dome of
   the Rock, the city even now presents one of the most imposing, as well
   as most profoundly affecting sights on earth. The brook Kedron, which
   Jesus crossed in that solemn night after the last Passover, and
   Gethsemane with its venerable olive-trees and reminiscences of the
   agony, and Mount Olivet from which he rose to heaven, are still there,
   and behind it the remnant of Bethany, that home of peace and holy
   friendship which sheltered him the last nights before the crucifixion.
   Standing on that mountain with its magnificent view, or at the turning
   point of the road from Jericho and Bethany, and looking over Mount
   Moriah and the holy city, we fully understand why the Saviour wept and
   exclaimed, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
   stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
   thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
   wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate!

   Thus the Land and the Book illustrate and confirm each other. The Book
   is still full of life and omnipresent in the civilized world; the Land
   is groaning under the irreformable despotism of the "unspeakable" Turk,
   which acts like a blast of the Sirocco from the desert. Palestine lies
   under the curse of God. It is at best a venerable ruin "in all the
   imploring beauty of decay," yet not without hope of some future
   resurrection in God's own good time. But in its very desolation it
   furnishes evidence for the truth of the Bible. It is "a fifth Gospel,"
   engraven upon rocks. [173]

   The People.

   Is there a better argument for Christianity than the Jews? Is there a
   more patent and a more stubborn fact in history than that intense and
   unchangeable Semitic nationality with its equally intense religiosity?
   Is it not truly symbolized by the bush in the desert ever burning and
   never consumed? Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus Epiphanes, Titus, Hadrian
   exerted their despotic power for the extermination of the Jews;
   Hadrian's edict forbade circumcision and all the rites of their
   religion; the intolerance of Christian rulers treated them for ages
   with a sort of revengeful cruelty, as if every Jew were personally
   responsible for the crime of the crucifixion. And, behold, the race
   still lives as tenaciously as ever, unchanged and unchangeable in its
   national traits, an omnipresent power in Christendom. It still
   produces, in its old age, remarkable men of commanding influence for
   good or evil in the commercial, political, and literary world; we need
   only recall such names as Spinoza, Rothschild, Disraeli, Mendelssohn,
   Heine, Neander. If we read the accounts of the historians and satirists
   of imperial Rome about the Jews in their filthy quarter across the
   Tiber, we are struck by the identity of that people with their
   descendants in the ghettos of modern Rome, Frankfurt, and New York.
   Then they excited as much as they do now the mingled contempt and
   wonder of the world; they were as remarkable then for contrasts of
   intellectual beauty and striking ugliness, wretched poverty and
   princely wealth; they liked onions and garlic, and dealt in old
   clothes, broken glass, and sulphur matches, but knew how to push
   themselves from poverty and filth into wealth and influence; they were
   rigid monotheists and scrupulous legalists who would strain out a gnat
   and swallow a camel; then as now they were temperate, sober,
   industrious, well regulated and affectionate in their domestic
   relations and careful for the religious education of their children.
   The majority were then, as they are now, carnal descendants of Jacob,
   the Supplanter, a small minority spiritual children of Abraham, the
   friend of God and father of the faithful. Out of this gifted race have
   come, at the time of Jesus and often since, the bitterest foes and the
   warmest friends of Christianity.

   Among that peculiar people Jesus spent his earthly life, a Jew of the
   Jews, yet in the highest sense the Son of Man, the second Adam, the
   representative Head and Regenerator of the whole race. For thirty years
   of reserve and preparation he hid his divine glory and restrained his
   own desire to do good, quietly waiting till the voice of prophecy after
   centuries of silence announced, in the wilderness of Judaea and on the
   banks of the Jordan, the coming of the kingdom of God, and startled the
   conscience of the people with the call to repent. Then for three years
   he mingled freely with his countrymen. Occasionally he met and healed
   Gentiles also, who were numerous in Galilee; he praised their faith the
   like of which he had not found in Israel, and prophesied that many
   shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the children of the
   kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. [174] He conversed with
   a woman of Samaria, to the surprise of his disciples, on the sublimest
   theme, and rebuked the national prejudice of the Jews by holding up a
   good Samaritan as a model for imitation. [175] It was on the occasion
   of a visit from some "Greeks," shortly before the crucifixion, that he
   uttered the remarkable prophecy of the universal attraction of his
   cross. [176] But these were exceptions. His mission, before the
   resurrection, was to the lost sheep of Israel. [177]

   He associated with all ranks of Jewish society, attracting the good and
   repelling the bad, rebuking vice and relieving misery, but most of his
   time he spent among the middle classes who constituted the bone and
   sinew of the nation, the farmers and workingmen of Galilee, who are
   described to us as an industrious, brave and courageous race, taking
   the lead in seditious political movements, and holding out to the last
   moment in the defence of Jerusalem. [178] At the same time they were
   looked upon by the stricter Jews of Judaea as semi-heathens and
   semi-barbarians; hence the question, "Can any good come out of
   Nazareth, and "Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet." [179] He selected
   his apostles from plain, honest, unsophisticated fishermen who became
   fishers of men and teachers of future ages. In Judaea he came in
   contact with the religious leaders, and it was proper that he should
   close his ministry and establish his church in the capital of the
   nation.

   He moved among the people as a Rabbi (my Lord) or a Teacher, and under
   this name he is usually addressed. [180] The Rabbis were the
   intellectual and moral leaders of the nation, theologians, lawyers, and
   preachers, the expounders of the law, the keepers of the conscience,
   the regulators of the daily life and conduct; they were classed with
   Moses and the prophets, and claimed equal reverence. They stood higher
   than the priests who owed their position to the accident of birth, and
   not to personal merit. They coveted the chief seats in the synagogues
   and at feasts; they loved to be greeted in the markets and to be called
   of men, "Rabbi, Rabbi." Hence our Lord's warning: "Be not ye called
   'Rabbi:' for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren."
   [181] They taught in the temple, in the synagogue, and in the
   schoolhouse (Bethhamidrash), and introduced their pupils, sitting on
   the floor at their feet, by asking, and answering questions, into the
   intricacies of Jewish casuistry. They accumulated those oral traditions
   which were afterwards embodied in the Talmud, that huge repository of
   Jewish wisdom and folly. They performed official acts gratuitously.
   [182] They derived their support from an honorable trade or free gifts
   of their pupils, or they married into rich families. Rabbi Hillel
   warned against making gain of the crown (of the law), but also against
   excess of labor, saying, "Who is too much given to trade, will not
   become wise." In the book of Jesus Son of Sirach (which was written
   about 200 b.c.) a trade is represented as incompatible with the
   vocation of a student and teacher, [183] but the prevailing sentiment
   at the time of Christ favored a combination of intellectual and
   physical labor as beneficial to health and character. One-third of the
   day should be given to study one-third to prayer, one third to work.
   "Love manual labor," was the motto of Shemaja, a teacher of Hillel. "He
   who does not teach his son a trade," said Rabbi Jehuda, "is much the
   same as if he taught him to be a robber." "There is no trade," says the
   Talmud, "which can be dispensed with; but happy is he who has in his
   parents the example of a trade of the more excellent sort." [184]

   Jesus himself was not only the son of a carpenter, but during his youth
   he worked at that trade himself. [185] When he entered upon his public
   ministry the zeal for God's house claimed all his time and strength,
   and his modest wants were more than supplied by a few grateful
   disciples from Galilee, so that something was left for the benefit of
   the poor. [186] St. Paul learned the trade of tentmaking, which was
   congenial to his native Cilicia, and derived from it his support even
   as an apostle, that he might relieve his congregations and maintain a
   noble independence. [187]

   Jesus availed himself of the usual places of public instruction in the
   synagogue and the temple, but preached also out of doors, on the
   mountain, at the, sea-side, and wherever the people assembled to hear
   him. "I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues
   and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret
   spake I nothing. [188] Paul likewise taught in the synagogue wherever
   he had an opportunity on his missionary journeys. [189] The familiar
   mode of teaching was by disputation, by asking and answering questions
   on knotty points, of the law, by parables and sententious sayings,
   which easily lodged in the memory; the Rabbi sat on a chair, the pupils
   stood or sat on the floor at his feet. [190] Knowledge of the Law of
   God was general among the Jews and considered the most important
   possession. They remembered the commandments better than their own
   name. [191] Instruction began in early childhood in the family and was
   carried on in the school and the synagogue. Timothy learned the sacred
   Scriptures on the knees of his mother and grandmother. [192] Josephus
   boasts, at the expense of his superiors, that when only fourteen years
   of age he had such an exact knowledge of the law that he was consulted
   by the high priest and the first men of Jerusalem. [193] Schoolmasters
   were appointed in every town, and children were taught to read in their
   sixth or seventh year, but writing was probably a rare accomplishment.
   [194]

   The synagogue was the local, the temple the national centre of
   religious and social life; the former on the weekly Sabbath (and also
   on Monday and Thursday), the latter on the Passover and the other
   annual festivals. Every town had a synagogue, large cities had many,
   especially Alexandria and Jerusalem. [195] The worship was very simple:
   it consisted of prayers, singing, the reading of sections from the Law
   and the Prophets in Hebrew, followed by a commentary and homily in the
   vernacular Aramaic. There was a certain democratic liberty of
   prophesying, especially outside of Jerusalem. Any Jew of age could read
   the Scripture lessons and make comments on invitation of the ruler of
   the synagogue. This custom suggested to Jesus the most natural way of
   opening his public ministry. When he returned from his baptism to
   Nazareth, "he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the
   Sabbath day, and stood up to read. And there was delivered unto him the
   roll of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the roll and found the place
   where it was written (61:1, 2) 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
   because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor; he hath sent
   me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the
   blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the
   acceptable year of the Lord.' And he closed the book, and gave it back
   to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue
   were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, 'To-day hath this
   scripture been fulfilled in your ears.' And all bare witness unto him,
   and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth:
   and they said, Is not this Joseph's son?" [196]

   On the great festivals he visited from his twelfth year the capital of
   the nation where the Jewish religion unfolded all its splendor and
   attraction. Large caravans with trains of camels and asses loaded with
   provisions and rich offerings to the temple, were set in motion from
   the North and the South, the East and the West for the holy city, "the
   joy of the whole earth;" and these yearly pilgrimages, singing the
   beautiful Pilgrim Psalms (Ps, 120 to 134), contributed immensely to the
   preservation and promotion of the common faith, as the Moslem
   pilgrimages to Mecca keep up the life of Islam. We may greatly reduce
   the enormous figures of Josephus, who on one single Passover reckoned
   the number of strangers and residents in Jerusalem at 2,700,000 and the
   number of slaughtered lambs at 256,500, but there still remains the
   fact of the vast extent and solemnity of the occasion. Even now in her
   decay, Jerusalem (like other Oriental cities) presents a striking
   picturesque appearance at Easter, when Christian pilgrims from the far
   West mingle with the many-colored Arabs, Turks, Greeks, Latins, Spanish
   and Polish Jews, and crowd to suffocation the Church of the Holy
   Sepulchre. How much more grand and dazzling must this cosmopolitan
   spectacle have been when the priests (whose number Josephus estimates
   at 20,000) with the broidered tunic, the fine linen girdle, the showy
   turban, the high priests with the ephod of blue and purple and scarlet,
   the breastplate and the mitre, the Levites with their pointed caps, the
   Pharisees with their broad phylacteries and fringes, the Essenes in
   white dresses and with prophetic mien, Roman soldiers with proud
   bearing, Herodian courtiers in oriental pomposity, contrasted with
   beggars and cripples in rags, when pilgrims innumerable, Jews and
   proselytes from all parts of the empire, "Parthians and Medes and
   Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in
   Pontus and Asia, in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and parts of Libya
   about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
   Cretans, and Arabians," [197] all wearing their national costume and
   speaking a Babel of tongues, surged through the streets, and pressed up
   to Mount Moriah where "the glorious temple rear'd her pile, far off
   appearing like a mount of alabaster, topp'd with golden spires" and
   where on the fourteenth day of the first month columns of sacrificial
   smoke arose from tens of thousands of paschal lambs, in historical
   commemoration of the great deliverance from the land of bondage, and in
   typical prefiguration of the still greater redemption from the slavery
   of sin and death. [198]

   To the outside observer the Jews at that time were the most religious
   people on earth, and in some sense this is true. Never was a nation so
   ruled by the written law of God; never did a nation so carefully and
   scrupulously study its sacred books, and pay greater reverence to its
   priests and teachers. The leaders of the nation looked with horror and
   contempt upon the unclean, uncircumcised Gentiles, and confirmed the
   people in their spiritual pride and conceit. No wonder that the Romans
   charged the Jews with the odium generis humani.

   Yet, after all, this intense religiosity was but a shadow of true
   religion. It was a praying corpse rather than a living body. Alas! the
   Christian Church in some ages and sections presents a similar sad
   spectacle of the deceptive form of godliness without its power. The
   rabbinical learning and piety bore the same relation to the living
   oracles of God as sophistic scholasticism to Scriptural theology, and
   Jesuitical casuistry to Christian ethics. The Rabbis spent all their
   energies in "fencing" the law so as to make it inaccessible. They
   analyzed it to death. They surrounded it with so many hair-splitting
   distinctions and refinements that the people could not see the forest
   for the trees or the roof for the tiles, and mistook the shell for the
   kernel. [199] Thus they made void the Word of God by the traditions of
   men. [200] A slavish formalism and mechanical ritualism was substituted
   for spiritual piety, an ostentatious sanctimoniousness for holiness of
   character, scrupulous casuistry for genuine morality, the killing
   letter for the life-giving spirit, and the temple of God was turned
   into a house of merchandise.

   The profanation and perversion of the spiritual into the carnal, and of
   the inward into the outward, invaded even the holy of holies of the
   religion of Israel, the Messianic promises and hopes which run like a
   golden thread from the protevangelium in paradise lost to the voice of
   John the Baptist pointing to the Lamb of God. The idea of a spiritual
   Messiah who should crush the serpent's head and redeem Israel from the
   bondage of sin, was changed into the conception of a political
   deliverer who should re-establish the throne of David in Jerusalem, and
   from that centre rule over the Gentiles to the ends of the earth. The
   Jews of that time could not separate David's Son, as they called the
   Messiah, from David's sword, sceptre and crown. Even the apostles were
   affected by this false notion, and hoped to secure the chief places of
   honor in that great revolution; hence they could not understand the
   Master when he spoke to them of his, approaching passion and death.
   [201]

   The state of public opinion concerning the Messianic expectations as
   set forth in the Gospels is fully confirmed by the preceding and
   contemporary Jewish literature, as the Sibylline Books (about b.c.
   140), the remarkable Book of Enoch (of uncertain date, probably from
   b.c. 130-30), the Psalter of Solomon (b.c. 63-48), the Assumption of
   Moses, Philo and Josephus, the Apocalypse of Baruch, and the Fourth
   Book of Esdras. [202] In all of them the Messianic kingdom, or the
   kingdom of God, is represented as an earthly paradise of the Jews, as a
   kingdom of this world, with Jerusalem for its capital. It was this
   popular idol of a pseudo-Messiah with which Satan tempted Jesus in the
   wilderness, when he showed him all the kingdoms of the world; well
   knowing that if he could convert him to this carnal creed, and induce
   him to abuse his miraculous power for selfish gratification, vain
   ostentation, and secular ambition, he would most effectually defeat the
   scheme of redemption. The same political aspiration was a powerful
   lever of the rebellion against the Roman yoke which terminated in the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and it revived again in the rebellion of
   Bar-Cocheba only to end in a similar disaster.

   Such was the Jewish religion at the time of Christ. He was the only
   teacher in Israel who saw through the hypocritical mask to the rotten
   heart. None of the great Rabbis, no Hillel, no Shammai, no Gamaliel
   attempted or even conceived of a reformation; on the contrary, they
   heaped tradition upon tradition and accumulated the talmudic rubbish of
   twelve large folios and 2947 leaves, which represents the
   anti-Christian petrifaction of Judaism; while the four Gospels have
   regenerated humanity and are the life and the light of the civilized
   world to this day.

   Jesus, while moving within the outward forms of the Jewish religion of
   his age, was far above it and revealed a new world of ideas. He, too,
   honored the law of God, but by unfolding its deepest spiritual meaning
   and fulfilling it in precept and example. Himself a Rabbi, he taught as
   one having direct authority from God, and not as the scribes. How he
   arraigned those hypocrites seated on Moses' seat, those blind leaders
   of the blind, who lay heavy burdens on men's shoulders without touching
   them with their finger; who shut the kingdom of heaven against men, and
   will not enter themselves; who tithe the mint and the anise and the
   cumin, and leave undone the weightier matters of the law, justice and
   mercy and faith; who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel; who are
   like unto whited sepulchres which outwardly appear beautiful indeed,
   but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. But
   while he thus stung the pride of the leaders, he cheered and elevated
   the humble and lowly. He blessed little children, he encouraged the
   poor, he invited the weary, he fed the hungry he healed the sick, he
   converted publicans and sinners, and laid the foundation strong and
   deep, in God's eternal love, for a new society and a new humanity. It
   was one of the sublimest as well as loveliest moments in the life of
   Jesus when the disciples asked him, Who is the greatest in the kingdom
   of heaven? and when he called a little child, set him in the midst of
   them and said, "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted and
   become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom
   of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little
   child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall
   receive one such little child in my name receiveth me." [203] And that
   other moment when he thanked his heavenly Father for revealing unto
   babes the things of the kingdom which were hid from the wise, and
   invited all that labor and are heavy laden to come to him for rest.
   [204]

   He knew from the beginning that he was the Messiah of God and the King
   of Israel. This consciousness reached its maturity at his baptism when
   he received the Holy Spirit without measure. [205] To this conviction
   he clung unwaveringly, even in those dark hours of the apparent failure
   of his cause, after Judas had betrayed him, after Peter, the confessor
   and rock-apostle, had denied him, and everybody had forsaken him. He
   solemnly affirmed his Messiahship before the tribunal of the Jewish
   highpriest; he assured the heathen representative of the Roman empire
   that he was a king, though not of this world, and when hanging on the
   cross he assigned to the dying robber a place in his kingdom. [206] But
   before that time and in the days of his greatest popularity he
   carefully avoided every publication and demonstration which might have
   encouraged the prevailing idea of a political Messiah and an uprising
   of the people. He chose for himself the humblest of the Messianic
   titles which represents his condescension to our common lot, while at
   the same time it implies his unique position as the representative head
   of the human family, as the ideal, the perfect, the universal, the
   archetypal Man. He calls himself habitually "the Son of Man" who "hath
   not where to lay his head," who "came not to be ministered unto but to
   minister and to give his life a ransom for many," who "hath power to
   forgive sins," who "came to seek and to save that which was lost."
   [207] When Peter made the great confession at Caesarea Philippi, Christ
   accepted it, but immediately warned him of his approaching passion and
   death, from which the disciple shrunk in dismay. [208] And with the
   certain expectation of his crucifixion, but also of his triumphant
   resurrection on the third day, he entered in calm and sublime fortitude
   on his last journey to Jerusalem which "killeth the prophets," and
   nailed him to the cross as a false Messiah and blasphemer. But in the
   infinite wisdom and mercy of God the greatest crime in history was
   turned into the greatest blessing to mankind.

   We must conclude then that the life and work of Christ, while admirably
   adapted to the condition and wants of his age and people, and receiving
   illustration and confirmation from his environment, cannot be explained
   from any contemporary or preceding intellectual or moral resources. He
   learned nothing from human teachers. His wisdom was not of this world.
   He needed no visions and revelations like the prophets and apostles. He
   came directly from his great Father in heaven, and when he spoke of
   heaven he spoke of his familiar home. He spoke from the fullness of God
   dwelling in him. And his words were verified by deeds. Example is
   stronger than precept. The wisest sayings remain powerless until they
   are incarnate in a living person. It is the life which is the light of
   men. In purity of doctrine and holiness of character combined in
   perfect harmony, Jesus stands alone, unapproached and unapproachable.
   He breathed a fresh life from heaven into his and all subsequent ages.
   He is the author of a new moral creation.

   Jesus and Hillel.--The infinite elevation of Christ above the men of
   his time and nation, and his deadly conflict with the Pharisees and
   scribes are so evident that it seems preposterous and absurd to draw a
   parallel between him and Hillel or any other Rabbi. And yet this has
   been done by some modern Jewish Rabbis, as Geiger, Grätz, Friedlander,
   who boldly affirm, without a shadow of historical proof, that Jesus was
   a Pharisee, a pupil of Hillel, and indebted to him for his highest
   moral principles. By this left-handed compliment they mean to
   depreciate his originality. Abraham Geiger (d. 1874) says, in his Das
   Judenthum und seine Geschichte (Breslau, 2d ed. 1865, vol. I. p. 117):
   "Jesus war ein Jude, ein pharisäischer Jude mit galiläischer Färbung,
   ein Mann der die Hofnungen der Zeit theilte und diese Hoffnungen in
   sich erfüllt glaubte. Einen neuen Gedanken sprach er keineswegs aus
   [!], auch brach er nicht etwa die Schranken der Nationalität .... Er
   hob nicht im Entferntesten etwas vom Judenthum auf; er war ein
   Pharisäer, der auch in den Wegen Hillels ging." This view is repeated
   by Rabbi Dr. M. H. Friedlander, in his Geschichtsbilder aus der Zeit
   der Tanaite n und Amoräer. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Talmuds
   (Brünn, 1879, p. 32): "Jesus, oder Jeschu, war der Sohn eines
   Zimmermeisters, Namens Josef, aus Nazareth. Seine Mutter hiess Mirjam
   oder Maria. Selbst der als conservativer Katholik [sic!] wie als
   bedeutender Gelehrter bekannte Ewald nennt ihn 'Jesus den Sohn
   Josef',.... Wenn auch Jesus' Gelehrsamkeit nicht riesig war, da die
   Galiläer auf keiner hohen Stufe der Cultur standen, so zeichnete er
   sich doch durch Seelenadel, Gemüthlichkeit und Herzensgü te
   vortheilhaft aus. Hillel I. scheint sein Vorbild und Musterbild gewesen
   zu sein; denn der hillelianische Grundsatz: 'Was dir nicht recht ist,
   füge, deinen Nebenmenschen nicht zu,' war das Grundprincip seiner
   Lehren."Renan makes a similar assertion in his Vie de Jésus (Chap. III.
   p. 35), but with considerable qualifications: "Par sa pauvreté
   humblement supportée, par la douceur de son caractère, par l'opposition
   qu'il faisait aux hypocrites et aux prêtres, Hillel fut le vrai maître
   de Jésus, s'il est permis de parler de maître, quand il s'agit d'une si
   haute originalité." This comparison has been effectually disposed of by
   such able scholars as Dr. Delitzsch, in his valuable pamphlet Jesus und
   Hillel (Erlangen, 3d revised ed. 1879, 40 pp.); Ewald, V. 12-48 (Die
   Schule Hillel's und deren Geqner); Keim I. 268-272; Schürer, p. 456;
   and Farrar, Life of Christ, II. 453-460. All these writers come to the
   same conclusion of the perfect independence and originality of Jesus.
   Nevertheless it is interesting to examine the facts in the case.

   Hillel and Shammai are the most distinguished among the Jewish Rabbis.
   They were contemporary founders of two rival schools of rabbinical
   theology (as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus of two schools of
   scholastic theology). It is strange that Josephus does not mention
   them, unless he refers to them under the Hellenized names of Sameas and
   Pollion; but these names agree better with Shemaja and Abtalion, two
   celebrated Pharisees and teachers of Hillel and Shammai; moreover he
   designates Sameas as a disciple of Pollion. (See Ewald, v. 22-26;
   Schürer, p. 455). The Talmudic tradition has obscured their history and
   embellished it with many fables.

   Hillel I. or the Great was a descendant of the royal family of David,
   and born at Babylon. He removed to Jerusalem in great poverty, and died
   about a.d. 10. He is said to have lived 120 years, like Moses, 40 years
   without learning, 40 years as a student, 40 years as a teacher. He was
   the grandfather of the wise Gamaliel in whose family the presidency of
   the Sanhedrin was hereditary for several generations. By his burning
   zeal for knowledge, and his pure, gentle and amiable character, he
   attained the highest renown. He is said to have understood all
   languages, even the unknown tongues of mountains, hills, valleys,
   trees, wild and tame beasts, and demons. He was called "the gentle, the
   holy, the scholar of Ezra." There was a proverb: "Man should be always
   as meek as Hillel, and not quick-tempered as Shammai." He differed from
   Rabbi Shammai by a milder interpretation of the law, but on some
   points, as the mighty question whether it was right or wrong to eat an
   egg laid on a Sabbath day, he took the more rigid view. A talmudic
   tract is called Beza, The Egg, after this famous dispute. What a
   distance from him who said: "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man
   for the Sabbath: so then the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

   Many wise sayings, though partly obscure and of doubtful
   interpretation, are attributed to Hillel in the tract Pirke Aboth
   (which is embodied in the Mishna and enumerates, in ch. 1, the pillars
   of the legal traditions from Moses down to the destruction of
   Jerusalem). The following are the best:

   "Be a disciple of Aaron, peace-loving and peace-making; love men, and
   draw them to the law."

   "Whoever abuses a good name (or, is ambitious of aggrandizing his name)
   destroys it."

   "Whoever does not increase his knowledge diminishes it."

   "Separate not thyself from the congregation, and have no confidence in
   thyself till the day of thy death."

   "If I do not care for my soul, who will do it for me? If I care only
   for my own soul, what am I? If not now, when then?"

   "Judge not thy neighbor till thou art in his situation."

   "Say not, I will repent when I have leisure, lest that leisure should
   never be thine."

   "The passionate man will never be a teacher."

   "In the place where there is not a man, be thou a man."

   Yet his haughty Pharisaism is clearly seen in this utterance: "No
   uneducated man easily avoids sin; no common person is pious." The
   enemies of Christ in the Sanhedrin said the same (John 7:49): "This
   multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed." Some of his teachings
   are of doubtful morality, e.g. his decision that, in view of a vague
   expression in Deut. 24:1, a man might put away his wife "even if she
   cooked his dinner badly." This is, however, softened down by modern
   Rabbis so as to mean: "if she brings discredit on his home."

   Once a heathen came to Rabbi Shammai and promised to become a proselyte
   if he could teach him the whole law while he stood on one leg. Shammai
   got angry and drove him away with a stick. The heathen went with the
   same request to Rabbi Hillel, who never lost his temper, received him
   courteously and gave him, while standing on one leg, the following
   effective answer:

   Do not to thy neighbor what is disagreeable to thee. This is the whole
   Law; all the rest is commentary: go and do that." (See Delitzsch, p.
   17; Ewald, V. 31, Comp. IV. 270).

   This is the wisest word of Hillel and the chief ground of a comparison
   with Jesus. But

   1. It is only the negative expression of the positive precept of the
   gospel, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," and of the golden
   rule, "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even
   so do ye also to them"(Matt. 7:12; Luke 6:31). There is a great
   difference between not doing any harm, and doing good. The former is
   consistent with selfishness and every sin which does not injure our
   neighbor. The Saviour, by presenting God's benevolence (Matt. 7:11) as
   the guide of duty, directs us to do to our neighbor all the good we
   can, and he himself set the highest example of self-denying love by
   sacrificing his life for sinners.

   2. It is disconnected from the greater law of supreme love to God,
   without which true love to our neighbor is impossible. "On these two
   commandments," combined and inseparable, hang all the law and the
   prophets" (Matt. 22:37-40).

   3. Similar sayings are found long before Hillel, not only in the
   Pentateuch and the Book of Tobith 4:15: (ho miseis medeni poieses, "Do
   that to no man which thou hatest"), but substantially even among the
   heathen (Confucius, Buddha, Herodotus, Isocrates, Seneca, Quintilian),
   but always either in the negative form, or with reference to a
   particular case or class; e.g. Isocrates, Ad Demonic. c. 4: "Be such
   towards your parents as thou shalt pray thy children shall be towards
   thyself;" and the same In Aeginet. c. 23: "That you would be such
   judges to me as you would desire to obtain for yourselves." See
   Wetstein on Matt. 7:12 (Nov. Test. I. 341 sq.). Parallels to this and
   other biblical maxims have been gathered in considerable number from
   the Talmud and the classics by Lightfoot, Grotius, Wetstein, Deutsch,
   Spiess, Ramage; but what are they all compared with the Sermon on the
   Mount? Moreover, si duo idem dicunt, non est idem. As to the rabbinical
   parallels, we must remember that they were not committed to writing
   before the second century, and that, Delitzsch says (Ein Tag in
   Capernaum, p. 137), "not a few sayings of Christ, circulated by Jewish
   Christians, reappeared anonymously or under false names in the Talmuds
   and Midrashim."

   4. No amount of detached words of wisdom constitute an organic system
   of ethics any, more than a heap of marble blocks constitute a palace or
   temple; and the best system of ethics is unable to produce a holy life,
   and is worthless without it.

   We may admit without hesitation that Hillel was "the greatest and best
   of all Pharisees" (Ewald), but he was far inferior to John the Baptist;
   and to compare him with Christ is sheer blindness or folly. Ewald calls
   such comparison "utterly perverse" (grundverkehrt, v. 48). Farrar
   remarks that the distance between Hillel and Jesus is "a distance
   absolutely immeasurable, and the resemblance of his teaching to that of
   Jesus is the resemblance of a glow-worm to the sun" (II. 455). "The
   fundamental tendencies of both," says Delitzsch (p. 23), "are as widely
   apart as he and earth. That of Hillel is legalistic, casuistic, and
   nationally contracted; that of Jesus is universally religious, moral
   and human. Hillel lives and moves in the externals, Jesus in the spirit
   of the law." He was not even a reformer, as Geiger and Friedlander
   would make him, for what they adduce as proofs are mere trifles of
   interpretation, and involve no new principle or idea.

   Viewed as a mere human teacher, the absolute originality of Jesus
   consists in this, "that his words have touched the hearts of all men in
   all ages, and have regenerated the moral life of the world" (Farrar,
   II. 454). But Jesus is far more than a Rabbi, more than a sage and
   saint more than a reformer, more than a benefactor; he is the author of
   the true religion, the prophet, priest and king, the renovator, the
   Saviour of men, the founder of a spiritual kingdom as vast as the race
   and as long as eternity.

   [162] Well says Hausrath (Preface to 2nd ed. of vol. I. p. ix) against
   the mythical theory: "Für die poëtische Welt der religiösen Sage ist
   innerhalb einer rein historischen Darstellung kein Raum; ihre Gebilde
   verbleichen vor einem geschichtlich hellen Hintergrund .... Wenn wir
   die heilige Geschichte als Bruchstück einer allgemeinen Geschichte
   nachweisen und zeigen können, wie die Ränder passen, wenn wir die
   abgerissenen Fäden, die sie mit der profanen Welt verbanden, wieder
   aufzufinden vermögen, dann ist die Meinung ausgeschlossen, diese
   Geschichte sei der schöne Traum eines späteren Geschlechtes gewesen."

   [163] The average length of Palestine is 150 miles, the average breadth
   east and west of the Jordan to the Mediterranean, from 80 to 90 miles,
   the number of square miles from 12,000 to 13,000. The State of Maryland
   has 11,124, Switzerland 15,992, Scotland 30,695 English square miles.

   [164] The tradition, which locates the Temptation on the barren and
   dreary mount Quarantania, a few miles northwest of Jericho, is of late
   date. Paul also probably went, after his conversion, as far as Mount
   Sinai during the three years of repose and preparation "in Arabia,"Gal.
   1:17, comp. 4:24.

   [165] W. Hepworth Dixon (The Holy Land, ch. 14) ingeniously pleads for
   the traditional cave, and the identity of the inn of the Nativity with
   the patrimony of Boaz and the home of David.

   [166] We add the vivid description of Renan (Vie de Jésus, Ch. II. p.
   25) from personal observation: "Nazareth was a small town, situated in
   a fold of land broadly open at the summit of the group of mountains
   which closes on the north the plain of Esdraëlon. The population is now
   from three to four [probably five to six] thousand, and it cannot have
   changed very much. It is quite cold in winter and the climate is very
   healthy. The town, like all the Jewish villages of the time, was a mass
   of dwellings built without style, and must have presented the same poor
   and uninteresting appearance as the villages in Semitic countries. The
   houses, from all that appears, did not differ much from those cubes of
   stone, without interior or exterior elegance, which now cover the
   richest portion of the Lebanon, and which, in the midst of vines and
   fig-trees, are nevertheless very pleasant. The environs, moreover, are
   charming, and no place in the world was so well adapted to dreams of
   absolute happiness (nul endroit du monde ne fut si bien fait pour les
   rêves de l'absolu bonheur). Even in our days, Nazareth is a delightful
   sojourn, the only place perhaps in Palestine where the soul feels a
   little relieved of the burden which weighs upon it in the midst of this
   unequalled desolation. The people are friendly and good-natured; the
   gardens are fresh and green. Antonius Martyr, at the end of the sixth
   century, draws an enchanting picture of the fertility of the environs,
   which he compares to paradise. Some valleys on the western side fully
   justify his description. The fountain about which the life and gayety
   of the little town formerly centered, has been destroyed; its broken
   channels now give but a turbid water. But the beauty of the women who
   gathered there at night, this beauty which was already remarked in the
   sixth century, and in which was seen the gift of the Virgin Mary, has
   been surprisingly well preserved. It is the Syrian type in all its
   languishing grace. There is no doubt that Mary was there nearly every
   day and took her place, with her urn upon her shoulder, in the same
   line with her unremembered countrywomen. Antonius Martyr remarks that
   the Jewish women, elsewhere disdainful to Christians, are here full of
   affability. Even at this day religious animosities are less intense at
   Nazareth than elsewhere." Comp. also the more elaborate description in
   Keim, I. 318 sqq., and Tobler's monograph on Nazareth, Berlin, 1868.

   [167] Josephus no doubt greatly exaggerates when he states that there
   were no less than two hundred and four towns and villages in Galilee
   (Vita, c. 45, diakosiai kai tessares kata ten Galilaian eisi poleis kai
   komai), and that the smallest of those villages contained above fifteen
   thousand inhabitants (Bell. Jud. III. 3, 2). This would give us a
   population of over three millions for that province alone, while the
   present population of all Palestine and Syria scarcely amounts to two
   millions, or forty persons to the square mile (according to Bädeker,
   Pal. and Syria, 1876, p. 86).

   [170] The present mongrel population of Jerusalem--Moslems, Jews, and
   Christians of all denominations, though mostly Greek--scarcely exceeds
   30,000, while at the time of Christ it must have exceeded 100,000, even
   if we make a large deduction from the figures of Josephus, who states
   that on a Passover under the governorship of Cestius Gallus 256,500
   paschal lambs were slain, and that at the destruction of the City, a.d.
   70, 1,100,000 Jews perished and 97,000 were sold into slavery
   (including 600,000 strangers who had crowded into the doomed city).

   [173] Renan sums up the results of his personal observations as
   director of the scientific commission for the exploration of ancient
   Phoenicia in 1860 and 1861, in the following memorable confession (Vie
   de Jêsus, Introd. p. liii.)."J'ai traversê dans tous les sens la
   province évangelique; j'ai visitê Jérusalem, Hêbron et la
   Samarie;presque aucune localité importante de l'histoire de Jésus ne
   m'a échappé. Toute cette histoire qui, à distance, semble flotter dans
   les nuages d'un monde sans réalité, prit ainsi un corps, une solidité
   qui m'étonnèrent. L'accord frappant des textes et des lieux, la
   merveilleuse harmonie de l'idéal évangélique avec le paysage qui lui
   servit de cadre furent pour moi comme une révélation. J'eus devant les
   yeux un cinquième évangile, lacéré, mais lisible encore, et désormais,
   à travers les récits de Matthieu et de Marc, au lieu d'un être
   abstrait, qu'on dirait n'avoir jamais existé, je vis une admirable
   figure humaine vivre, se mouvoir." His familiarity with the Orient
   accounts for the fact that this brilliant writer leaves much more
   historical foundation for the gospel history than his
   predecessorStrauss, who never saw Palestine.

   have been always able to make a strong resistance on all occasions of
   war; for the Galileans are inured to war from their infancy, and have
   been always very numerous; nor hath the country ever been destitute of
   men of courage, or wanted a numerous set of them: for their soil is
   universally rich and fruitful, and full of the plantations of trees of
   all sorts, insomuch that it invites the most slothful to take pains in
   its cultivation by its fruitfulness: accordingly it is all cultivated
   by its inhabitants, and no part of it lies idle. Moreover, the cities
   lie here very thick, and the very many villages there are so full of
   people, by richness of their soil, that the very least of them
   contained above fifteen thousand inhabitants (?)."

   Erlangen, third ed. revised, 1879. He states (p. 77) that more than one
   hundred Rabbis who figure in the Talmud carried on a trade and were
   known by it, as R. Oshaja the shoemaker, R. Abba the tailor, R. Juda
   the baker, R. Abba Josef the architect, R. Chana the banker, R. Abba
   Shaul the grave-digger, R. Abba Oshaja the fuller, R. Abin the
   carpenter, etc. He remarks (p. 23): "The Jews have always been an
   industrious people and behind no other in impulse, ability and
   inventiveness for restless activity; agriculture and trade were their
   chief occupations before the dissolution of their political
   independence; only in consequence of their dispersion and the
   contraction of their energies have they become a people of sharpers and
   peddlers and taken the place of the old Phoenicians." But the talent
   and disposition for sharp bargains was inherited from their father
   Jacob, and turned the temple of God into "a house of merchandise."
   Christ charges the Pharisees with avarice which led them to "devour
   widows' houses." Comp. Matt. 23:14; Mark 12:40; Luke 16:14; 20:47.

   Scriptures. Precisely the same charge was applied by the Reformers to
   the doctrines of the monks and schoolmen of their day.

   § 18. Apocryphal Traditions.

   We add some notes of minor interest connected with the history of
   Christ outside of the only authentic record in the Gospel.

   I. The Apocryphal Sayings of our Lord.--The canonical Gospels contain
   all that is necessary for us to know about the words and deeds of our
   Lord, although many more might have been recorded (John 20:30; 21:25).
   Their early composition and reception in the church precluded the
   possibility of a successful rivalry of oral tradition. The
   extra-biblical sayings of our Lord are mere fragments, few in number,
   and with one exception rather unimportant, or simply variations of
   genuine words.

   They have been collected by Fabricius, in Codex Apocr. N. T., I pp.
   321-335; Grabe: Spicilegium SS. Patrum, ed. alt. I. 12 sqq., 326 sq.;
   Koerner: De sermonibus Christi agraphois (Lips. 1776); Routh, in Reliq.
   Sacrae, vol. I. 9-12, etc.; Rud. Hofmann, in Das Leben Jesu nach den
   Apokryphen (Leipz. 1851, § 75, pp. 317-334); Bunsen, in Anal. ante-Nic.
   I. 29 sqq.; Anger, in Synops. Evang. (1852); Westcott: Introd. to the
   Study of the Gospels, Append. C. (pp. 446 sqq. of the Boston ed. by
   Hackett); Plumptre, in Ellicott's Com. for English Readers, I. p.
   xxxiii.; J. T. Dodd: Sayings ascribed to our Lord by the Fathers
   (1874); E. B. Nicholson:The Gospel according to the Hebrews (Lond.
   1879, pp. 143-162). Comp. an essay of Ewald in his "Jahrbücher der
   Bibl. Wissenschaft," VI. 40 and 54 sqq., and Geschichte Christus', p.
   288. We avail ourselves chiefly of the collections of Hofmann,
   Westcott, Plumptre, and Nicholson.

   (1) "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Quoted by Paul, Acts
   20:35. Comp. Luke 6:30, 31; also Clement of Rome, Ad Cor. c. 2, edion
   didontes e lambanontes, "more gladly giving than receiving." This is
   unquestionably authentic, pregnant with rich meaning, and shining out
   like a lone star all the more brilliantly. It is true in the highest
   sense of the love of God and Christ. The somewhat similar sentences of
   Aristotle, Seneca, and Epicurus, as quoted by Plutarch (see the
   passages in Wetstein on Acts 20:35), savor of aristocratic pride, and
   are neutralized by the opposite heathen maxim of mean selfishness:
   "Foolish is the giver, happy the receiver." Shakespeare may have had
   the sentence in his mind when he put into the mouth of Portia the
   golden words:


   "The quality of mercy is not strained,

   It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

   Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;

   It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;

   'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes

   The throned monarch better than his crown."

   (2) "And on the same day Jesus saw a man working at his craft on the
   Sabbath-day, and He said unto him, 'O man, if thou knowest what thou
   doest, then art thou blessed; but if thou knowest not, then art thou
   accursed, and art a transgressor of the Law.' " An addition to Luke
   6:4, in Codex D. or Bezae (in the University library at Cambridge),
   which contains several remarkable additions. See Tischendorf's
   apparatus in ed. VIII. Luc. 6:4, and Scrivener, lntrod. to Criticism of
   the N. T. p. 8. epikataratosis used John 7:49 (text. rec.) by the
   Pharisees of the people who know not the law (also Gal. 3:10, 13 in
   quotations from the O. T.); parabates tou nomouby Paul (Rom. 2:25, 27;
   Gal. 2:18) and James (2:9, 11). Plumptre regards the narrative as
   authentic, and remarks that "it brings out with a marvellous force the
   distinction between the conscious transgression of a law recognized as
   still binding, and the assertion of a higher law as superseding the
   lower. Comp. also the remarks of Hofmann, l.c. p. 318.

   (3) "But ye seek (or, in the imperative, seek ye, zeteite) to increase
   from little, and (not) from greater to be less." An addition in Codex
   D. to Matt 20:28. See Tischendorf. Comp. Luke 14:11; John 5:44.
   Westcott regards this as a genuine fragment. Nicholson inserts "not,"
   with the Curetonian Syriac, D; all other authorities omit it. Juvencus
   has incorporated the passage in his poetic Hist. Evang. III. 613 sqq.,
   quoted by Hofmann, p. 319.

   (4) "Be ye trustworthy money-changers, or, proved bankers (trapezitai
   dokimoi); i.e. expert in distinguishing the genuine coin from the
   counterfeit. Quoted by Clement of Alexandria (several times), Origen
   (in Joann, xix.), Eusebius, Epiphanius, Cyril of Alexandria, and many
   others. Comp. 1 Thess. 5:21: "Prove all things, hold fast the good,"
   and the parable of the talents, Matt. 25:27. Delitzsch, who with many
   others regards this maxim as genuine, gives it the meaning: Exchange
   the less valuable for the more valuable, esteem sacred coin higher than
   common coin, and highest of all the one precious pearl of the
   gospel.(Ein Tag in Capernaum, p. 136.) Renan likewise adopts it as
   historical, but explains it in an Ebionite and monastic sense as an
   advice of voluntary poverty. "Be ye good bankers (soyez de bons
   banquiers), that is to say: Make good investments for the kingdom of
   God, by giving your goods to the poor, according to the ancient proverb
   (Prov. 19:17): 'He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth to the Lord' "
   (Vie de Jésus, ch. XI. p. 180, 5th Par. ed.).

   [(5) "The Son of God says,(?) 'Let us resist all iniquity, and hold it
   in abhorrence.' " From the Epistle of Barnabas, c. 4. This Epistle,
   though incorporated in the Codex Sinaiticus, is probably not a work of
   the apostolic Barnabas. Westcott and Plumptre quote the passage from
   the Latin version, which introduces the sentence with the words: sicut
   dicit Filius Dei. But this seems to be a mistake for sicut decet filios
   Dei, "as becometh the sons of God." This is evident from the Greek
   original (brought to light by the discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus),
   which reads, hos prepei huiois theou and connects the words with the
   preceding sentence. See the edition of Barnabae Epistula by Gebhardt
   and Harnack in Patr. Apost. Op. I. 14. For the sense comp. 2 Tim. 2:19:
   apostato apo adikiasJames 4:7: anistete to diabolo, Ps. 119:163:
   adikian emisesa.]

   (6) "They who wish to see me, and to lay hold on my kingdom, must
   receive me with affliction and suffering." From the Epistle of
   Barnabas, c. 7, where the words are introduced by "Thus he [Jesus]
   saith," phesin But it is doubtful whether they are meant as a quotation
   or rather as a conclusion of the former remarks and a general
   reminiscence of several passages. Comp. Matt. 16:24; 20:3; Acts 14:22:
   "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."

   (7) "He that wonders [ho thaumasaswith the wonder of reverential faith]
   shall reign, and he that reigns shall be made to rest." From the
   "Gospel of the Hebrews," quoted by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. II. 9,
   § 45). The Alexandrian divine quotes this and the following sentence to
   show, as Plumptre finely says, "that in the teaching of Christ, as in
   that of Plato, wonder is at once the beginning and the end of
   knowledge."

   (8) "Look with wonder at the things that are before thee (thaumason ta
   paronta)." From Clement of Alexandria (Strom. II. 9, § 45.).

   (9) "I came to abolish sacrifices, and unless ye cease from
   sacrificing, the wrath [of God] will not cease from you." From the
   Gospel of the Ebionites (or rather Essaean Judaizers), quoted by
   Epiphanius (Haer. xxx. 16). Comp. Matt. 9:13, "I will have mercy and
   not sacrifice."

   (10) "Ask great things, and the small shall be added to you: ask
   heavenly and there shall be added unto you earthly things." Quoted by
   Clement of Alexandria (Strom. I. 24, § 154; comp. IV. 6, § 34) and
   Origen (de Oratione, c. 2), with slight differences. Comp. Matt. 6:33,
   of which it is probably a free quotation from memory. Ambrose also
   quotes the sentence (Ep. xxxvi. 3): "Denique scriptum est: 'Petite
   magna, et parva adjicientur vobis. Petite coelestia, et terrena
   adjicientur.'"

   (11) "In the things wherein I find you, in them will I judge you."
   Quoted by Justin Martyr (Dial. c. Tryph. c. 47), and Clement of
   Alexandria (Quis dives, § 40). Somewhat different Nilus: "Such as I
   find thee, I will judge thee, saith the Lord." The parallel passages in
   Ezekiel 7:3, 8; 18:30; 24:14; 33:20 are not sufficient to account for
   this sentence. It is probably taken from an apocryphal Gospel. See
   Hofmann, p. 323.

   (12) "He who is nigh unto me is nigh unto the fire: he who is far from
   me is far from the kingdom. From Origen (Comm. in Jer. III. p. 778),
   and Didymus of Alexandria (in Ps. 88:8). Comp, Luke 12:49. Ignatius (Ad
   Smyrn. c. 4) has a similar saying, but not as a quotation, "To be near
   the sword is to be near God" (engus machairas engus theou).

   (13) "If ye kept not that which is little, who will give you that which
   is great? For I say unto you, he that is faithful in the least is
   faithful also in much." From the homily of Pseudo-Clement of Rome (ch.
   8). Comp. Luke 16:10-12 and Matt. 25:21, 23. Irenaeus (II. 34, 3)
   quotes similarly, probably from memory: "Si in modico fideles non
   fuistis, quod magnum est quis dabit nobis?"

   (14) "Keep the flesh pure, and the seal [probably baptism] without
   stain that we (ye) may receive eternal life." From Pseudo-Clement, ch.
   8. But as this is connected with the former sentence by ara oun touto
   legei, it seems to be only an explanation ("he means this") not a
   separate quotation. See Lightfoot, St. Clement of Rome, pp. 200 and
   201, and his Appendix containing the newly recovered Portions, p. 384:.
   On the sense comp. 2 Tim. 2:19; Rom. 4:11; Eph. 1:13; 4:30.

   (15) Our Lord, being asked by Salome when His kingdom should come, and
   the things which he had spoken be accomplished, answered, "When the two
   shall be one, and the outward as the inward, and the male with the
   female, neither male nor female." From Clement of Alexandria, as a
   quotation from "the Gospel according to the Egyptians" (Strom.III. 13,
   § 92), and the homily of Pseudo-Clement of Rome (ch. 12). Comp. Matt.
   22:30; Gal. 3:28; 1 Cor. 7:29. The sentence has a mystical coloring
   which is alien to the genuine Gospels, but suited the Gnostic taste.

   (16) "For those that are infirm was I infirm, and for those that hunger
   did I hunger, and for those that thirst did I thirst." From Origen (in
   Matt. xiii. 2). Comp. Matt. 25:35, 36; 1 Cor. 9:20-22.

   (17) "Never be ye joyful, except when ye have seen your brother
   [dwelling] in love." Quoted from the Hebrew Gospel by Jerome (in Eph.
   v. 3).

   (18) "Take hold, handle me, and see that I am not a bodiless demon
   [i.e. spirit]." From Ignatius (Ad Symrn. c. 3), and Jerome, who quotes
   it from the Nazarene Gospel (De Viris illustr. 16). Words said to have
   been spoken to Peter and the apostles after the resurrection. Comp.
   Luke 24:39; John 20:27.

   (19) "Good must needs come, but blessed is he through whom it cometh;
   in like manner evil must needs come, but woe to him through whom it
   cometh." From the "Clementine Homilies," xii. 29. For the second clause
   comp. Matt. 18:7; Luke 17:1.

   (20) "My mystery is for me, and for the sons of my house." From Clement
   of Alexandria (Strom. V. 10, § 64), the Clementine Homilies (xix. 20),
   and Alexander of Alexandria (Ep. ad Alex. c. 5, where the words are
   ascribed to the Father). Comp. Isa. 24:16 (Sept.); Matt. 13:11; Mark
   4:11.

   (21) "If you do not make your low things high and your crooked things
   straight ye shall not enter into my kingdom." From the Acta Philippi in
   Tischendorf's Acta Apost. Apocr. p. 90, quoted by Ewald, Gesch.
   Christus, p. 288, who calls these words a weak echo of more excellent
   sayings.

   (22) "I will choose these things to myself. Very excellent are those
   whom my Father that is in heaven hath given to me." From the Hebrew
   Gospel, quoted by Eusebius (Theophan. iv. 13).

   (23) "The Lord said, speaking of His kingdom, 'The days will come in
   which vines will spring up, each having ten thousand stocks, and on
   each stock ten thousand branches, and on each branch ten thousand
   shoots, and on each shoot ten thousand bunches, and on each bunch ten
   thousand grapes, and each grape when pressed shall give five-and-twenty
   measures of wine. And when any saint shall have laid hold on one bunch,
   another shall cry, I am a better bunch, take me; through me bless the
   Lord.' Likewise also [he said], 'that a grain of wheat shall produce
   ten thousand ears of corn, and each grain ten pounds of fine pure
   flour; and so all other fruits and seeds and each herb according to its
   proper nature. And that all animals, using for food what is received
   from the earth, shall live in peace and concord with one another,
   subject to men with all subjection.' " To this description Papias adds:
   "These things are credible to those who believe. And when Judas the
   traitor believed not and asked, 'How shall such products come from the
   Lord?' the Lord said, 'They shall see who come to me in these times.' "
   From the "weak-minded" Papias (quoted by Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. V. 33,
   3). Comp. Isa. 11:6-9.

   This is a strongly figurative description of the millennium. Westcott
   thinks it is based on a real discourse, but to me it sounds fabulous,
   and borrowed from the Apocalypse of Baruch which has a similar passage
   (cap. 29, first published in Monumenta Sacra et Profana opera collegii
   Doctorum Bibliothecae Ambrosianae, Tom. I. Fasc. II. Mediol. 1866, p.
   80, and then in Fritzsche's ed. of Libri Apocryphi Veteris Test. Lips.
   1871, p. 666): "Etiam terra dabit fructus suos unum in decem millia, et
   in vite una erunt Mille palmites, et unus palmes faciet mille botros,
   et botrus unus faciet mille acinos, et unus acinus faciet corum vini.
   Et qui esurierunt jucundabuntur, iterum autem videbunt prodigia
   quotidie .... Et erit in illo tempore, descendet iterum desuper
   thesaurus manna, et comedent ex eo in istis annis."

   Westcott quotes eleven other apocryphal sayings which are only loose
   quotations or perversions of genuine words of Christ, and may therefore
   be omitted. Nicholson has gathered the probable or possible fragments
   of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which correspond more or less
   to passages in the canonical Gospels.

   Mohammedan tradition has preserved in the Koran and in other writings
   several striking words of Christ, which Hofmann, l.c. pp. 327-329, has
   collected. The following is the best:

   "Jesus, the Son of Mary, said, 'He who longs to be rich is like a man
   who drinks sea-water; the more he drinks the more thirsty he becomes,
   and never leaves off drinking till he perishes."

   II. Personal Appearance of Jesus. None of the Evangelists, not even the
   beloved disciple and bosom-friend of Jesus, gives us the least hint of
   his countenance and stature, or of his voice, his manner, his food, his
   dress, his mode of daily life. In this respect our instincts of natural
   affection have been wisely overruled. He who is the Saviour of all and
   the perfect exemplar for all should not be identified with the
   particular lineaments of one race or nationality or type of beauty. We
   should cling to the Christ in spirit and in glory rather than to the
   Christ in the flesh So St. Paul thought (2 Cor. 5:16; Comp. 1 Pet.
   1:8). Though unseen, he is loved beyond all human beings.


   I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,

   Yet art Thou oft with me;

   And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot,

   As when I meet with Thee."

   Jesus no doubt accommodated himself in dress and general appearance to
   the customs of his age and people, and avoided all ostentation. He
   probably passed unnoticed through busy crowds. But to the closer
   observer he must have revealed a spiritual beauty and an overawing
   majesty in his countenance and personal bearing. This helps to explain
   the readiness with which the disciples, forsaking all things, followed
   him in boundless reverence and devotion. He had not the physiognomy of
   a sinner. He had more than the physiognomy of a saint. He reflected
   from his eyes and countenance the serene peace and celestial purity of
   a sinless soul in blessed harmony with God. His presence commanded
   reverence, confidence and affection.

   In the absence of authentic representation, Christian art in its
   irrepressible desire to exhibit in visible form the fairest among the
   children of men, was left to its own imperfect conception of ideal
   beauty. The church under persecution in the first three centuries, was
   averse to pictorial representations of Christ, and associated with him
   in his state of humiliation (but not in his state of exaltation) the
   idea of uncomeliness, taking too literally the prophetic description of
   the suffering Messiah in the twenty-second Psalm and the fifty-third
   chapter of Isaiah. The victorious church after Constantine, starting
   from the Messianic picture in the forty-fifth Psalm and the Song of
   Solomon, saw the same Lord in heavenly glory, "fairer than the children
   of men" and "altogether lovely." Yet the difference was not so great as
   it is sometimes represented. For even the ante-Nicene fathers
   (especially Clement of Alexandria), besides expressly distinguishing
   between the first appearance of Christ in lowliness and humility, and
   his second appearance in glory and, majesty, did not mean to deny to
   the Saviour even in the days of his flesh a higher order of spiritual
   beauty, "the glory of the only-begotten of the Father full of grace and
   truth," which shone through the veil of his humanity, and which at
   times, as on the mount of transfiguration, anticipated his future
   glory. "Certainly," says Jerome, "a flame of fire and starry brightness
   flashed from his eye, and the majesty of the God head shone in his
   face."

   The earliest pictures of Christ, in the Catacombs, are purely symbolic,
   and represent him under the figures of the Lamb, the good Shepherd, the
   Fish. The last has reference to the Greek word Ichthys, which contains
   the initials of the words Iesous Christos Theou Huios Soter. "Jesus
   Christ, Son of God, Saviour." Real pictures of Christ in the early
   church would have been an offence to the Jewish, and a temptation and
   snare to the heathen converts.

   The first formal description of the personal appearance of Christ,
   which, though not authentic and certainly not older than the fourth
   century, exerted great influence on the pictorial representations, is
   ascribed to the heathen Publius Lentulus, a supposed contemporary of
   Pilate and "President of the people of Jerusalem" (there was no such
   office), in an apocryphal Latin letter to the Roman Senate, which was
   first discovered in a MS. copy of the writings of Anselm of Canterbury
   in the twelfth century, and published with slight variations by,
   Fabricius, Carpzov, Gabler, etc. It is as follows:

   "In this time appeared a man, who lives till now, a man endowed with
   great powers. Men call him a great prophet; his own disciples term Him
   the Son of God. His name is Jesus Christ. He restores the dead to life,
   and cures the sick of all manner of diseases. This man is of noble and
   well-proportioned stature, with a face full of kindness and yet
   firmness, so that the beholders both love Him and fear Him. His hair is
   of the color of wine, and golden at the root; straight, and without
   lustre, but from the level of the ears curling and glossy, and divided
   down the centre after the fashion of the Nazarenes [Nazarites?]. His
   forehead is even and smooth, his face without wrinkle or blemish, and
   glowing with delicate bloom. His countenance is frank and kind. Nose
   and mouth are in no way faulty. His beard is full, of the same hazel
   color as his hair, not long, but forked. His eyes are blue, and
   extremely brilliant. In reproof and rebuke he is formidable; in
   exhortation and teaching, gentle and amiable. He has never been seen to
   laugh, but oftentimes to weep, (numquam visus est ridere, flere autem
   saepe). His person is tall and erect; his hands and limbs beautiful and
   straight. In speaking he is deliberate and grave, and little given to
   loquacity. In beauty he surpasses the children of men."

   Another description is found in the works of the Greek theologian, John
   of Damascus, of the 8th century (Epist. ad Theoph. Imp. de venerandis
   Imag., spurious), and a similar one in the Church History of Nicephorus
   (I. 40), of the 14th century. They represent Christ as resembling his
   mother, and ascribe to him a stately person though slightly stooping,
   beautiful eyes, blond, long, and curly hair, pale, olive complexion,
   long fingers, and a look expressive of nobility, wisdom, and patience.

   On the ground of these descriptions, and of the Abgar and the Veronica
   legends, arose a vast number of pictures of Christ, which are divided
   into two classes: the Salvator pictures, with the expression of calm
   serenity and dignity, without the faintest mark of grief, and the Ecce
   Homo pictures of the suffering Saviour with the crown of thorns. The
   greatest painters and sculptors have exhausted the resources of their
   genius in representations of Christ; but neither color nor chisel nor
   pen can do more than produce a feeble reflection of the beauty and
   glory of Him who is the Son of God and the Son of Man.

   Among modern biographers of Christ, Dr. Sepp (Rom. Cath., Das Leben
   Jesu Christi, 1865, vol. VI. 312 sqq.) defends the legend of St.
   Veronica of the Herodian family, and the genuineness of the picture, of
   the suffering Saviour with the crown of thorns which he impressed on
   her silken veil. He rejects the philological explanation of the legend
   from "the true image" (vera eikon= Veronica), and derives the name from
   pherenike (Berenice), the Victorious. But Bishop Hefele (Art.
   Christusbilder, in the Cath. Kirchen-Lexikon of Wetzer and Welte, II.
   519-524) is inclined, with Grimm, to identify Veronica with the
   Berenice who is said to have erected a statue to Christ at Caesarea
   Philippi (Euseb. VII. 18), and to see in the Veronica legend only the
   Latin version of the Abgar legend of the Greek Church. Dr. Hase (Leben
   Jesu, p. 79) ascribes to Christ manly beauty, firm health, and
   delicate, yet not very characteristic features. He quotes John 20:14
   and Luke 24:16, where it is said that his friends did not recognize
   him, but these passages refer only to the mysterious appearances of the
   risen Lord. Renan (Vie de Jésus, ch. X-XIV. p. 403) describes him in
   the frivolous style of a novelist, as a doux Galilèen, of calm and
   dignified attitude, as a beau jeune hommewho made a deep impression
   upon women, especially Mary of Magdala; even a proud Roman lady, the
   wife of Pontius Pilate, when she caught a glimpse of him from the
   window (?), was enchanted, dreamed of him in the night and was
   frightened at the prospect of his death. Dr. Keim (I. 463) infers from
   his character, as described in the Synoptical Gospels, that he was
   perhaps not strikingly handsome, yet certainly noble, lovely, manly,
   healthy and vigorous, looking like a prophet, commanding reverence,
   making men, women, children, sick and poor people feel happy in his
   presence. Canon Farrar (I. 150) adopts the view of Jerome and
   Augustine, and speaks of Christ as "full of mingled majesty and
   tenderness in--


   'That face

   How beautiful, if sorrow had not made

   Sorrow more beautiful than beauty's self.' "

   III. The Testimony of Josephus on John the Baptist. Antiq. Jud. xviii.
   c. 5, § 2. Whatever may be thought of the more famous passage of Christ
   which we have discussed in § 14 (p. 92), the passage on John is
   undoubtedly genuine and so accepted by most scholars. It fully and
   independently confirms the account of the Gospels on John's work and
   martyrdom, and furnishes, indirectly, an argument in favor of the
   historical character of their account of Christ, for whom he merely
   prepared the way. We give it in Whiston's translation: "Now some of the
   Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and
   that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, who was
   called the Baptist; for Herod slew him, who was a good man (agathon
   andra), and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to
   righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to
   come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable
   to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or
   the remission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the
   body: supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand
   by righteousness. Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for
   they were greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who
   feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it
   into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion (for they seemed
   ready to do anything he should advise), thought it best, by putting him
   to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself
   into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it
   when it should be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of
   Herod's suspicious temper, to Machaerus, the castle I before mentioned,
   and was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the
   destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a
   mark of God's displeasure to him."

   IV. The Testimony of Mara to Christ, a.d. 74. This extra-biblical
   notice of Christ, made known first in 1865, and referred to above § 14
   p. 94) reads as follows (as translated from the Syriac by Cureton and
   Pratten):

   "What are we to say, when the wise are dragged by force by hands of
   tyrants, and their wisdom is deprived of its freedom by slander, and
   they are plundered for their [superior] intelligence, without [the
   opportunity of making] a defence? [They are not wholly to be pitied.]
   For what benefit did the Athenians obtain by putting Socrates to death,
   seeing that they received as retribution for it famine and pestilence?
   Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, seeing that in one
   hour the whole of their country was covered with sand? Or The Jews [by
   the murder] of their Wise King, seeing that from that very time their
   kingdom was driven away [from them]? For with justice did God grant a
   recompense to the wisdom of [all] three of them. For the Athenians died
   by famine; and the people of Samos were covered by the sea without
   remedy; and the Jews, brought to destruction and expelled from their
   kingdom, are driven away into every land. [Nay], Socrates did not die,
   because of Plato; nor yet Pythagoras, because of the statue of Hera;
   nor yet The Wise King, because of the new laws he enacted.

   The nationality and position of Mara are unknown. Dr. Payne Smith
   supposes him to have been a Persian. He wrote from prison and wished to
   die, "by what kind of death concerns me not." In the beginning of his
   letter Mara says: "On this account, lo, I have written for thee this
   record, [touching] that which I have by careful observation discovered
   in the world. For the kind of life men lead has been carefully observed
   by me. I tread the path of learning, and from the study of Greek
   philosophy have I found out all these things, although they suffered
   shipwreck when the birth of life took place." The birth of life may
   refer to the appearance of Christianity in the world, or to Mara's own
   conversion. But there is no other indication that he was a Christian.
   The advice he gives to his son is simply to "devote himself to wisdom,
   the fount of all things good, the treasure that fails not."

   § 19. The Resurrection of Christ.

   The resurrection of Christ from the dead is reported by the four
   Gospels, taught in the Epistles, believed throughout Christendom, and
   celebrated on every "Lord's Day," as an historical fact, as the
   crowning miracle and divine seal of his whole work, as the foundation
   of the hopes of believers, as the pledge of their own future
   resurrection. It is represented in the New Testament both as an act of
   the Almighty Father who raised his Son from the dead, [209] and as an
   act of Christ himself, who had the power to lay down his life and to
   take it again. [210] The ascension was the proper conclusion of the
   resurrection: the risen life of our Lord, who is "the Resurrection and
   the Life," could not end in another death on earth, but must continue
   in eternal glory in heaven. Hence St. Paul says, "Christ being raised
   from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. For
   the death that he died he died unto sin once: but the life that he
   liveth, he liveth unto God." [211]

   The Christian church rests on the resurrection of its Founder. Without
   this fact the church could never have been born, or if born, it would
   soon have died a natural death. The miracle of the resurrection and the
   existence of Christianity are so closely connected that they must stand
   or fall together. If Christ was raised from the dead, then all his
   other miracles are sure, and our faith is impregnable; if he was not
   raised, he died in vain and our faith is vain. It was only his
   resurrection that made his death available for our atonement,
   justification and salvation; without the resurrection, his death would
   be the grave of our hopes; we should be still unredeemed and under the
   power of our sins. A gospel of a dead Saviour would be a contradiction
   and wretched delusion. This is the reasoning of St. Paul, and its force
   is irresistible. [212]

   The resurrection of Christ is therefore emphatically a test question
   upon which depends the truth or falsehood of the Christian religion. It
   is either the greatest miracle or the greatest delusion which history
   records. [213]

   Christ had predicted both his crucifixion and his resurrection, but the
   former was a stumbling-block to the disciples, the latter a mystery
   which they could not understand till after the event. [214] They no
   doubt expected that he would soon establish his Messianic kingdom on
   earth. Hence their utter disappointment and downheartedness after the
   crucifixion. The treason of one of their own number, the triumph of the
   hierarchy, the fickleness of the people, the death and burial of the
   beloved Master, had in a few hours rudely blasted their Messianic hopes
   and exposed them to the contempt and ridicule of their enemies. For two
   days they were trembling on the brink of despair. But on the third day,
   behold, the same disciples underwent a complete revolution from
   despondency to hope, from timidity to courage, from doubt to faith, and
   began to proclaim the gospel of the resurrection in the face of an
   unbelieving world and at the peril of their lives. This revolution was
   not isolated, but general among them; it was not the result of an easy
   credulity, but brought about in spite of doubt and hesitation; [215] it
   was not superficial and momentary, but radical and lasting; it
   affected, not only the apostles, but the whole history of the world. It
   reached even the leader of the persecution, Saul of Tarsus one of the
   clearest and strongest intellects, and converted him into the most
   devoted and faithful champion of this very gospel to the hour of his
   martyrdom.

   This is a fact patent to every reader of the closing chapters of the
   Gospels, and is freely admitted even by the most advanced skeptics.
   [216]

   The question now rises whether this inner revolution in the, life of
   the disciples, with its incalculable effects upon the fortunes of
   mankind, can be rationally explained without a corresponding outward
   revolution in the history of Christ; in other words, whether the
   professed faith of the disciples in the risen Christ was true and real,
   or a hypocritical lie, or an honest self-delusion.

   There are four possible theories which have been tried again and again,
   and defended with as much learning and ingenuity as can be summoned to
   their aid. Historical questions are not like mathematical problems. No
   argument in favor of the resurrection will avail with those critics who
   start with the philosophical assumption that miracles are impossible,
   and still less with those who deny not only the resurrection of the
   body, but even the immortality of the soul. But facts are stubborn, and
   if a critical hypothesis can be proven to be psychologically and
   historically impossible and unreasonable, the result is fatal to the
   philosophy which underlies the critical hypothesis. It is not the
   business of the historian to construct a history from preconceived
   notions and to adjust it to his own liking, but to reproduce it from
   the best evidence and to let it speak for itself.

   1. The Historical view, presented by the Gospels and believed in the
   Christian church of every denomination and sect. The resurrection of
   Christ was an actual though miraculous event, in harmony with his
   previous history and character, and in fulfilment of his own
   prediction. It was a re-animation of the dead body of Jesus by a return
   of his soul from the spirit-world, and a rising of body and soul from
   the grave to a new life, which after repeated manifestations to
   believers during a short period of forty days entered into glory by the
   ascension to heaven. The object of the manifestations was not only to
   convince the apostles personally of the resurrection, but to make them
   witnesses of the resurrection and heralds of salvation to all the
   world. [217]

   Truth compels us to admit that there are serious difficulties in
   harmonizing the accounts of the evangelists, and in forming a
   consistent conception of the nature of Christ's, resurrection-body,
   hovering as it were between heaven and earth, and oscillating for forty
   days between a natural and a supernatural state of the body clothed
   with flesh and blood and bearing the wound-prints, and yet so spiritual
   as to appear and disappear through closed doors and to ascend visibly
   to heaven. But these difficulties are not so great as those which are
   created by a denial of the fact itself. The former can be measurably
   solved, the latter cannot. We, do not know all the details and
   circumstances which might enable us to clearly trace the order of
   events. But among all the variations the great central fact of the
   resurrection itself and its principal features "stand out all the more
   sure." [218] The period of the forty days is in the nature of the case
   the most mysterious in the life of Christ, and transcends all ordinary
   Christian experience. The Christophanies resemble in some respect, the
   theophanies of the Old Testament, which were granted only to few
   believers, yet for the general benefit. At all events the fact of the
   resurrection furnishes the only key for the solution of the
   psychological problem of the sudden, radical, and permanent change in
   the mind and conduct of the disciples; it is the necessary link in the
   chain which connects their history before and after that event. Their
   faith in the resurrection was too clear, too strong, too steady, too
   effective to be explained in any other way. They showed the strength
   and boldness of their conviction by soon returning to Jerusalem, the
   post of danger, and founding there, in the very face of the hostile
   Sanhedrin, the mother-church of Christendom.

   2. The Theory of Fraud. The apostles stole and hid the body of Jesus,
   and deceived the world. [219]

   This infamous lie carries its refutation on its face: for if the Roman
   soldiers who watched the grave at the express request of the priests
   and Pharisees, were asleep, they could not see the thieves, nor would
   they have proclaimed their military crime; if they, or only some of
   them, were awake, they would have prevented the theft. As to the,
   disciples, they were too timid and desponding at the time to venture on
   such a daring act, and too honest to cheat the world. And finally a
   self-invented falsehood could not give them the courage and constancy
   of faith for the proclamation of the resurrection at the peril of their
   lives. The whole theory is a wicked absurdity, an insult to the common
   sense and honor of mankind.

   3. The Swoon-Theory. The physical life of Jesus was not extinct, but
   only exhausted, and was restored by the tender care of his friends and
   disciples, or (as some absurdly add) by his own medical skill; and
   after a brief period he quietly died a natural death. [220]

   Josephus, Valerius Maximus, psychological and medical authorities have
   been searched and appealed to for examples of such apparent
   resurrections from a trance or asphyxy, especially on the third day,
   which is supposed to be a critical turning-point for life or
   putrefaction.

   But besides insuperable physical difficulties--as the wounds and loss
   of blood from the very heart pierced by the spear of the Roman
   soldier--this theory utterly fails to account for the moral effect. A
   brief sickly existence of Jesus in need of medical care, and
   terminating in his natural death and final burial, without even the
   glory of martyrdom which attended the crucifixion, far from restoring
   the faith of the apostles, would have only in the end deepened their
   gloom and driven them to utter despair. [221]

   4. The Vision-Theory. Christ rose merely in the imagination of his
   friends, who mistook a subjective vision or dream for actual reality,
   and were thereby encouraged to proclaim their faith in the resurrection
   at the risk of death. Their wish was father to the belief, their belief
   was father to the fact, and the belief, once started, spread with the
   power of a religious epidemic from person to person and from place to
   place. The Christian society wrought the miracle by its intense love
   for Christ. Accordingly the resurrection does not belong to the history
   of Christ at all, but to the inner life of his disciples. It is merely
   the embodiment of their reviving faith.

   This hypothesis was invented by a heathen adversary in the second
   century and soon buried out of sight, but rose to new life in the
   nineteenth, and spread with epidemical rapidity among skeptical critics
   in Germany, France, Holland and England. [222]

   The advocates of this hypothesis appeal first and chiefly to the vision
   of St. Paul on the way to Damascus, which occurred several years later,
   and is nevertheless put on a level with the former appearances to the
   older apostles (1 Cor. 15:8); next to supposed analogies in the history
   of religious enthusiasm and mysticism, such as the individual visions
   of St. Francis of Assisi, the Maid of Orleans, St. Theresa (who
   believed that she had seen Jesus in person with the eyes of the soul
   more distinctly than she could have seen him with the eyes of the
   body), Swedenborg, even Mohammed, and the collective visions of the
   Montanists in Asia Minor, the Camisards in France, the spectral
   resurrections of the martyred Thomas à Becket of Canterbury and
   Savonarola of Florence in the excited imagination of their admirers,
   and the apparitions of the Immaculate Virgin at Lourdes. [223]

   Nobody will deny that subjective fancies and impressions are often
   mistaken for objective realities. But, with the exception of the case
   of St. Paul--which we shall consider in its proper place, and which
   turns out to be, even according to the admission of the leaders of
   skeptical criticism, a powerful argument against the mythical or
   visionary theory--these supposed analogies are entirely irrelevant;
   for, not to speak of other differences, they were isolated and passing
   phenomena which left no mark on history; while the faith in the
   resurrection of Christ has revolutionized the whole world. It must
   therefore be treated on its own merits as an altogether unique case.

   (a) The first insuperable argument against the visionary nature, and in
   favor of the objective reality, of the resurrection is the empty tomb
   of Christ. If he did not rise, his body must either have been removed,
   or remained in the tomb. If removed by the disciples, they were guilty
   of a deliberate falsehood in preaching the resurrection, and then the
   vision-hypothesis gives way to the exploded theory of fraud. If removed
   by the enemies, then these enemies had the best evidence against the
   resurrection, and would not have failed to produce it and thus to
   expose the baselessness of the vision. The same is true, of course, if
   the body had remained in the tomb. The murderers of Christ would
   certainly not have missed such an opportunity to destroy the very
   foundation of the hated sect.

   To escape this difficulty, Strauss removes the origin of the illusion
   away off to Galilee, whether the disciples fled; but this does not help
   the matter, for they returned in a few weeks to Jerusalem, where we
   find them all assembled on the day of Pentecost.

   This argument is fatal even to the highest form of the vision
   hypothesis, which admits a spiritual manifestation of Christ from
   heaven, but denies the resurrection of his body.

   (b) If Christ did not really rise, then the words which he spoke to
   Mary Magdalene, to the disciples of Emmaus, to doubting Thomas, to
   Peter on the lake of Tiberias, to all the disciples on Mount Olivet,
   were likewise pious fictions. But who can believe that words of such
   dignity and majesty, so befitting the solemn moment of the departure to
   the throne of glory, as the commandment to preach the gospel to every
   creature, to baptize the nations in the name of the Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit, and the promise to be with his disciples alway to
   the end of the world--a promise abundantly verified in the daily
   experience of the church--could proceed from dreamy and self-deluded
   enthusiasts or crazy fanatics any more than the Sermon on the Mount or
   the Sacerdotal Prayer! And who, with any spark of historical sense, can
   suppose that Jesus never instituted baptism, which has been performed
   in his name ever since the day of Pentecost, and which, like the
   celebration of the Lord's Supper, bears testimony to him every day as
   the sunlight does to the sun!

   (c) If the visions of the resurrection were the product of an excited
   imagination, it is unaccountable that they should suddenly have ceased
   on the fortieth day (Acts 1:15), and not have occurred to any of the
   disciples afterwards, with the single exception of Paul, who expressly
   represents his vision of Christ as "the last." Even on the day of
   Pentecost Christ did not appear to them, but, according to his promise,
   "the other Paraclete" descended upon them; and Stephen saw Christ in
   heaven, not on earth. [224]

   (d) The chief objection to the vision-hypothesis is its intrinsic
   impossibility. It makes the most exorbitant claim upon our credulity.
   It requires us to believe that many persons, singly and collectively,
   at different times, and in different places, from Jerusalem to
   Damascus, had the same vision and dreamed the same dream; that the
   women at the open sepulchre early in the morning, Peter and John soon
   afterwards, the two disciples journeying to Emmaus on the afternoon of
   the resurrection day, the assembled apostles on the evening in the
   absence of Thomas, and again on the next Lord's Day in the presence of
   the skeptical Thomas, seven apostles at the lake of Tiberias, on one
   occasion five hundred brethren at once most of whom were still alive
   when Paul reported the fact, then James, the brother of the Lord, who
   formerly did not believe in him, again all the apostles on Mount Olivet
   at the ascension, and at last the clearheaded, strong-minded persecutor
   on the way to Damascus--that all these men and women on these different
   occasions vainly imagined they saw and heard the self-same Jesus in
   bodily shape and form; and that they were by this baseless vision
   raised all at once from the deepest gloom in which the crucifixion of
   their Lord had left them, to the boldest faith and strongest hope which
   impelled them to proclaim the gospel of the resurrection from Jerusalem
   to Rome to the end of their lives! And this illusion of the early
   disciples created the greatest revolution not only in their own views
   and conduct, but among Jews and Gentiles and in the subsequent history
   of mankind! This illusion, we are expected to believe by these
   unbelievers, gave birth to the most real and most mighty of all facts,
   the Christian Church which has lasted these eighteen hundred years and
   is now spread all over the civilized world, embracing more members than
   ever and exercising more moral power than all the kingdoms and all
   other religions combined!

   The vision-hypothesis, instead of getting rid of the miracle, only
   shifts it from fact to fiction; it makes an empty delusion more
   powerful than the truth, or turns all history itself at last into a
   delusion. Before we can reason the resurrection of Christ out of
   history we must reason the apostles and Christianity itself out of
   existence. We must either admit the miracle, or frankly confess that we
   stand here before an inexplicable mystery.

   Remarkable Concessions.--The ablest advocates of the vision-theory are
   driven against their wish and will to admit some unexplained objective
   reality in the visions of the risen or ascended Christ.

   Dr. Baur, of Tübingen (d. 1860), the master-critic among sceptical
   church historians, and the corypheus of the Tübingen school, came at
   last to the conclusion (as stated in the revised edition of his Church
   History of the First Three Centuries, published shortly before his
   death, 1860) that "nothing but the miracle of the resurrection could
   disperse the doubts which threatened to drive faith itself into the
   eternal night of death (Nur das Wunder der Auferstehung konnte die
   Zweifel zerstreuen, welche den Glauben selbst in die ewige Nacht des
   Todes verstossen zu müssen schienen)."Geschichte der christlichen
   Kirche, I.39. It is true he adds that the nature of the resurrection
   itself lies outside of historical investigation ("Was die Auferstehung
   an sich ist, liegt ausserhalb des Kreises der geschichtlichen
   Untersuchung"), but also, that "for the faith of the disciples the
   resurrection of Jesus became the most solid and most irrefutable
   certainty. In this faith only Christianity gained a firm foothold of
   its historical development. (In diesem Glauben hat erst das
   Christenthum den festen Grund seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung
   gewonnen.) What history requires as the necessary prerequisite of all
   that follows is not so much the fact of the resurrection itself [?] as
   the faith in that fact. In whatever light we may consider the
   resurrection of Jesus, whether as an actual objective miracle or as a
   subjective psychological one (als ein objectiv geschehenes Wunder, oder
   als ein subjectiv psychologisches), even granting the possibility of
   such a miracle, no psychological analysis can penetrate the inner
   spiritual process by which in the consciousness of the disciples their
   unbelief at the death of Jesus was transformed into a belief of his
   resurrection .... We must rest satisfied with this, that for them the
   resurrection of Christ was a fact of their consciousness, and had for
   them all the reality of an historical event." (Ibid., pp. 39, 40.)
   Baur's remarkable conclusion concerning the conversion of St. Paul
   (ibid., pp. 44, 45) we shall consider in its proper place.

   Dr. Ewald, of Göttingen (d. 1874), the great orientalist and historian
   of Israel, antagonistic to Baur, his equal in profound scholarship and
   bold, independent, often arbitrary criticism, but superior in religious
   sympathy with the genius of the Bible, discusses the resurrection of
   Christ in his History of the Apostolic Age (Gesch. des Volkes Israel,
   vol. VI. 52 sqq.), instead of his Life of Christ, and resolves it into
   a purely spiritual, though long continued manifestation from heaven.
   Nevertheless he makes the strong statement (p. 69) that "nothing is
   historically more certain than that Christ rose from the dead and
   appeared to his own, and that this their vision was the beginning of
   their new higher faith and of an their Christian labors." "Nichts steht
   geschichtlich fester," he says, "als dass Christus aus den Todten
   auferstanden den Seinigen wiederschien und dass dieses ihr wiedersehen
   der anfang ihres neuen höhern glaubens und alles ihres Christlichen
   wirkens selbst war. Es ist aber ebenso gewiss dass sie ihn nicht wie
   einen gewöhnlichen menschen oder wie einen aus dem grabe aufsteigenden
   schatten oder gespenst wie die sage von solchen meldet, sondern wie den
   einzigen Sohn Gottes, wie ein durchaus schon übermächtiges und
   übermenschliches wesen wiedersahen und sich bei späteren
   zurückerinnerungen nichts anderes denken konnten als dass jeder welcher
   ihn wiederzusehen gewürdigt sei auch sogleich unmittelbar seine einzige
   göttliche würde erkannt und seitdem felsenfest daran geglaubt habe. Als
   den ächten König und Sohn Gottes hatten ihn aber die Zwölfe und andre
   schon im leben zu erkennen gelernt: der unterschied ist nur der dass
   sie ihn jetzt auch nach seiner rein göttlichen seite und damit auch als
   den über den tod siegreichen erkannt zu haben sich erinnerten. Zwischen
   jenem gemeinen schauen des irdischen Christus wie er ihnen sowohl
   bekannt war und diesem höhern tieferregten entzückten schauen des
   himmlischen ist also dock ein innerer zusammenhang, so dass sie ihn
   auch jetzt in diesen ersten tagen und wochen nach seinem tode nie als
   den himmlischen Messias geschauet hätten wenn sie ihn nicht schon
   vorher als den irdischen so wohl gekannt hätten."

   Dr. Keim, of Zürich (d. at Giessen, 1879), an independent pupil of
   Baur, and author of the most elaborate and valuable Life of Christ
   which the liberal critical school has produced, after giving every
   possible advantage to the mythical view of the resurrection, confesses
   that it is, after all, a mere hypothesis and fails to explain the main
   point. He says (Geschichte Jesu von Nazara, III. 600): "Nach allen
   diesen Ueberlegungen wird man zugestehen müssen, dass auch die
   neuerdings beliebt gewordene Theorie nur eine Hypothese ist, welche
   Einiges erklärt, die Hauptsache nicht erklärt, ja im Ganzen und Grossen
   das geschichtlich Bezeugte schiefen und hinfälligen Gesichtspunkten
   unterstellt. Misslingt aber gleichmässig der Versuch, die überlieferte
   Aufs Auferstehungsgeschichte festzuhalten, wie das Unternehmen, mit
   Hilfe der paulinischen Visionen eine natürliche Erklärung des
   Geschehenen aufzubauen, so bleibt für die Geschichte zunächst kein Weg
   übrig als der des Eingeständnisses, dass die Sagenhaftigkeit der
   redseligen Geschichte und die dunkle Kürze der glaubwürdigen Geschichte
   es nicht gestattet, über die räthselhaften Ausgange des Lebens Jesu, so
   wichtig sie an und für sich und in der Einwirkung auf die
   Weltgeschichte gewesen sind, ein sicheres unumstössliches Resultat zu
   geben. Für die Geschichte, sofern sie nur mit benannten evidenten
   Zahlen und mit Reihen greifbarer anerkannter Ursachen und Wirkungen
   rechnet, existirt als das Thatsächliche und Zweifellose lediglich der
   feste Glaube der Apostel, dass Jesus auferstanden, und die ungeheure
   Wirkung dieses Glaubens, die Christianisirung der Menschheit. On p. 601
   he expresses the conviction that "it was the crucified and living
   Christ who, not as the risen one, but rather as the divinely glorified
   one (als der wenn nicht Auferstandene, so doch vielmehr himmlisch
   Verherrlichte), gave visions to his disciples and revealed himself to
   his society." In his last word on the great problem, Keim, in view of
   the exhaustion and failure of the natural explanations, comes to the
   conclusion, that we must either, with Dr. Baur, humbly confess our
   ignorance, or return to the faith of the apostles who "have seen the
   Lord" (John 20:25). See the third and last edition of his abridged
   Geschichte Jesu, Zürich, 1875, p. 362.

   Dr. Schenkel, of Heidelberg, who in his Charakterbild Jesu (third ed.
   1864, pp. 231 sqq.) had adopted the vision-theory in its higher form as
   a purely spiritual, though real manifestation from heaven, confesses in
   his latest work, Das Christusbild der Apostel (1879, p. 18), his
   inability to solve the problem of the resurrection of Christ, and says:
   "Niemals wird es der Forschung gelingen, das Räthsel des
   Auferstehungsglaubens zu ergründen. Nichts aber steht fester in der
   Geschichte als die Thatsache dieses Glaubens; auf ihm beruht die
   Stiftung der christlichen Gemeinschaft ... Der Visionshypothese, welche
   die Christuserscheinungen der Jünger aus Sinnestäuschungen erklären
   will, die in einer Steigerung des 'Gemüths und Nervenlebens' ihre
   physische und darum auch psychische Ursache hatten,... steht vor allem
   die Grundfarbe der Stimmung in den Jüngern, namentlich in Petrus, im
   Wege: die tiefe Trauer, das gesunkene Selbstvertrauen, die nagende
   Gewissenspein, der verlorne Lebensmuth. Wie soll aus einer solchen
   Stimmung das verklärte Bild des Auferstandenen hervorgehen, mit dieser
   unverwüstlichen Sicherheit und unzerstörbaren Freudigkeit, durch welche
   der Auferstehungsglaube die Christengemeinde in allen Stürmen und
   Verfolgungen aufrecht zu erhalten vermochte?"

   [209] Acts 2:24, 32; Rom. 6:4; l0:9; 1 Cor. 15:15; Eph. 1:20; 1 Pet.
   1:21.

   [210] John 2:19; 10:17, 18. In like manner the first advent of the Lord
   is represented as his own voluntary act and as a mission from the
   Father, John 8:42: ego' ek teou exelthen Kai-i' heko oude-i' ga'r ap
   emautou elelutha, all ekeino's me apesteilen.)

   [211] Rom. 6:9, 10. Neander (Leben Jesu, pp. 596 and 597 of the 6th
   Germ. ed.) makes some excellent remarks on this inseparable connection
   between the resurrection and the ascension, and says that the asc
   ension would stand fast as a supernatural fact even if Luke had not
   said a word about it. A temporary resurrection followed by another
   death could never have become the foundation of a church.

   [212] 1 Cor. 15:13-19; comp. Rom. 4:25, where Paul represents Christ's
   death and resurrection in inseparable connection, as the sum and
   substance of the whole gospel.

   [213] Ewald makes the striking remark (VI. 90) that the resurrection is
   "the culmination of all the miraculous events which are conceivable
   from the beginning of history to its close."

   [214] Matt. 16:21-23; 17:9, 22, 23; 20:17-20; Mark 8:31; 9:9, 10, 31,
   32 ("they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him");
   Luke 9:22, 44, 45; 18:31-34; 24:6-8; John 2:21, 22; 3:14; 8:28; 10:17,
   18; 12:32.

   [215] The devoted women went to the sepulchre on the first Christian
   Sabbath, not to see it empty but to embalm the body with spices for its
   long rest, Mark 16:1; Luke 23:56; and when they told the eleven what
   they saw, their words seemed to them "as idle talk," and "they
   disbelieved them," Luke 24:11. Comp. Matt. 28:17 ("some doubted"); Mark
   16: 8 ("they were afraid"); John 20:25.

   [216] Dr. Baur states the contrast tersely thus: "Zwischen dem Tod
   [Jesu]und seiner Auferstehung liegt ein so tiefes undurchdringliches
   Dunkel, dass man nach so gewaltsam zerrissenem und so wundervoll
   wiederhergestelltem Zusammenhange sich gleichsam auf einem neuen
   Schauplatz der Geschichte sieht."Compare his remarks at the close of
   this section. Dr. Ewald describes the depression and sudden exaltation
   of the disciples more fully with his usual force (vol. vi. 54 sqq.). I
   will quote also the description of Renan, at the beginning of the first
   chapter of his work, Les Apôtres: "Jésus, quoique parlant sans cesse de
   résurrection, de nouvelle vie, n'avait jamais dit bien clairement qu'il
   ressusciterait en sa chair. Les disciples, (dans les premières heures
   qui suivirent sa mort, n'avaient à cet égard aucune espérance arrétée.
   Les sentimentsdont ils nous font la naive confidence supposent méme
   qu'ils croyaient tout fini. Ils pleurent et enterrent leur ami, sinon
   comme un mort vulgaire, du moins comme une personne dont la perte est
   irréparable (Marc 16:10; Luc 24:17, 21) ils sont tristes et abattus;
   l'espoir qu'ils avaient eu de le voir realiser le salut d'Israël est
   convaincu de vanité; on dirait des hommes qui ont perdu une grande et
   chère illusion. Mais l' enthousiasme et l'amour ne connaissent par les
   situations sans issue. Ils se jouentde l'impossible, et plutot que
   d'abdiquer l'espérance, ils font violence à toute réalité," etc.

   [217] Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15, 16; Luke 24;46-48; John 20:21-23;
   Acts 1:8.

   [218] So Meyer says, who is one of the fairest as well as most careful
   exegetes (Com. on John, 5th Germ. ed., p. 643). I will add the
   observations of Canon Farrar (Life of Christ, vol. II 432): "The
   lacunae, the compressions, the variations, the actual differences, the
   subjectivity of the narrators as affected by spiritual revelations,
   render all harmonies at the best uncertain. Our belief in the
   resurrection, as an historic fact, as absolutely well attested to us by
   subsequent and contemporary circumstances as any other event in
   history, rests on grounds far deeper, wider, more spiritual, more
   eternal, than can be shaken by divergences of which we can only say
   that they are not necessarily contradictions, but of which the true
   solution is no longer attainable. Hence the 'ten discrepancies' which
   have been dwelt on since the days of Celsus, have never for one hour
   shaken the faith of Christendom. The phenomena presented by the
   narratives are exactly such as we should expect, derived as they are
   from different witnesses, preserved at first in oral tradition only,
   and written 1,800 years ago at a period when minute circumstantial
   accuracy, distinguished from perfect truthfulness, was little regarded.
   St. Paul, surely no imbecile or credulous enthusiast, vouches, both for
   the reality of the appearances, and also for the fact that the vision
   by which he was himself converted came, at a long interval after the
   rest, to him as to the 'abortive-born' of the apostolic family (1 Cor.
   15:4-8). If the narratives of Christ's appearance to his disciples were
   inventions, how came they to possess the severe and simple character
   which shows no tinge of religious excitement? If those appearances were
   purely subjective, how can we account for their sudden, rapid, and
   total cessation ? As Lange finely says, the great fugue of the first
   Easter tidings has not come to us as a 'monotonous chorale,' and mere
   boyish verbal criticism cannot understand the common feeling and
   harmony which inspire the individual vibrations of those enthusiastic
   and multitudinous voices (vol. V. 61). Professor Westcott, with his
   usual profundity, and insight, points out the differences of purpose in
   the narrative of the four Evangelists. St. Matthew dwells chiefly on
   the majesty and glory of the Resurrection; St. Mark, both in the
   original part and in the addition (Mark 16:9-20), insists upon it as a
   fact; St. Luke, as a spiritual necessity; St. John, as a touchstone of
   character (Introd. 310-315).

   [219] This theory was invented by the Jewish priests who crucified the
   Lord, and knew it to be false, Matt. 27:62-66; 28:12-15. The lie was
   repeated and believed, like many other lies, by credulous infidels,
   first by malignant Jews at the time of Justin Martyr, then by Celsus,
   who learned it from them, but wavered between it and the vision-theory,
   and was renewed in the eighteenth century by Reimarus in the
   Wolfenbüttel Fragments. Salvador, a French Jew, has again revived and
   modified it by assuming (according to Hase, Geschichte Jesu, p. 132)
   that Jesus was justly crucified, and was saved by the wife of Pilate
   through Joseph of Arimathaea or some Galilean women; that he retired
   among the Essenes and appeared secretly to a few of his disciples. (See
   his Jésus Christ et sa doctrine, Par. 1838.) Strauss formerly defended
   the vision-hypothesis (see below), but at the close of his life, when
   he exchanged his idealism and pantheism for materialism and atheism, he
   seems to have relapsed into this disgraceful theory of fraud; for in
   his Old and New Faith (1873) he was not ashamed to call the
   resurrection of Christ "a world-historical humbug." Truth or falsehood:
   there is no middle ground.

   [220] The Scheintod-Hypothese (as the Germans call it) was ably
   advocated by Paulus of Heidelberg (1800), and modified by Gfrörer
   (1838), who afterwards became a Roman Catholic. We are pained to add
   Dr. Hase (Gesch. Jesu, 1876, p. 601), who finds it necessary, however,
   to call to aid a "special providence," to maintain some sort of
   consistency with his former advocacy of the miracle of the
   resurrection, when he truly said (Leben Jesu, p. 269, 5th ed. 1865):
   "Sonach ruht die Wahrheit der Auferstehung unerschütterlich auf dem
   Zeugnisse, ja auf dem Dasein der apostolischen Kirche."

   [221] Dr. Strauss (in his second Leben Jesu, 1864, p. 298) thus
   strikingly and conclusively refutes the swoon-theory: "Ein halbtodt aus
   dem Grabe Hervorgekrochener, siech Umherschleichender, der ärztlichen
   Pflege, des Verbandes, der Stärkung und Schonung Bedürftiger, und am
   Ende doch dem Leiden Erliegender konnte auf die Jünger unmöglich den
   Eindruck des Sieqers über Tod und Grab, des Lebensfürsten machen, der
   ihrem spätern Auftreten zu Grunde lag. Ein solches Wiederaufleben hätte
   den Eindruck, den er im Leben und Tode auf sie gemacht hatte, nur
   schwächen, denselben höchstens elegisch ausklingen lassen, unmöglich
   aber ihre Trauer in Beigeisterung verwandeln, ihre Verehrung zur
   Anbetung steigern können." Dr. Hase (p. 603) unjustly calls this
   exposure of the absurdity of his own view, "Straussische
   Tendenzmalerei."Even more effective is the refutation of the
   swoon-theory by Dr. Keim (Leben Jesu v. Naz. III. 576): "Und dann das
   Unmöglichste: der arme, schwache, kranke, mühsam auf den Füssen
   erhaltene, versteckte, verkleidete, schliesslich hinsterbende Jesus ein
   Gegenstand des Glaubens, des Hochgefühles, des Triumphes seiner
   Anhänger, ein auferstandener Sieger und Gottessohn! In der That hier
   beginnt die Theorie armselig, abgeschmackt, ja verwerflich zu werden,
   indem sie die Apostel als arme Betrogene, oder gar mit Jesus selber als
   Betrüger zeigt. Denn vom Scheintod hatte man auch damals einen Begriff,
   und die Lage Jesu musste zeigen, dass hier von Auferstehung nicht die
   Rede war; hielt man ihn doch für auferstanden, gab er sich selbst als
   auferstanden, so. fehlte das nüchterne Denken, und hütete er sich gar,
   seinen Zustand zu verrathen, so fehlte am Ende auch die Ehrlichkeit.
   Aus allen diesen Gründen ist der Scheintod von der Neuzeit fast
   ausnahmslos verworfen worden."

   [222] The vision-hypothesis (Visions-Hypothese)was first suggested by
   the heathen Celsus (see Keim, III. 577), and in a more respectful form
   by the Jewish philosopher Spinoza, and elaborately carried out by
   Strauss and Renan, with the characteristic difference, however, that
   Strauss traces the resurrection dream to the apostles in Galilee, Renan
   (after Celsus) to Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem, saying, in his Life of
   Jesus (almost blasphemously), that "the passion of a hallucinated woman
   gave to the world a risen God!" In his work on the Apostles, Renan
   enters more fully into the question and again emphasizes, in the
   genuine style of a French novelist, the part of the Magdalene."La
   gloire de la résurrection (he says, p. 13) appartient à Marie de,
   Magdala. Apres Jésus, c'est Marie qui a le plus fait pour la fondation
   du christianisme. L'ombre créée par les sens délicats de Madeleine
   plane encore sur le monde .... Sa grande affirmation de femme: 'Il est
   resuscité!' a été la base de la foi de l'humanité."The vision-theory
   has also been adopted and defended by Zeller, Holsten (in an able
   treatise on the Gospel of Paul and Peter, 1868), Lang, Volkmar,
   Réville, Scholten, Meijboom, Kuenen, Hooykaas. Comp. Keim, III. 579
   sqq. Among English writers the anonymous author of Supernatural
   Religion is its chief champion, and states it in these words (vol. III.
   526, Lond. ed. of 1879): "The explanation which we offer, and which has
   long been adopted in various forms by able critics" [among whom, in a
   foot-note, he falsely quotes Ewald] "is, that doubtless Jesus was seen
   Gr. (wjvfqh), but the vision was not real and objective, but illusory
   and subjective; that is to say, Jesus was not himself seen, but only a
   representation of Jesus within the minds of the beholders." On the
   other hand Ewald, Schenkel, Alex. Schweizer, and Keim have essentially
   modified the theory by giving the resurrection-visions an objective
   character and representing them as real though purely spiritual
   manifestations of the exalted Christ from heaven. Hase calls this view
   happily a Verhimmelung der Visionshypothese (Gesch. Jesu, p. 597). It
   is certainly a great improvement and a more than half-way approach to
   the truth, but it breaks on the rock of the empty sepulchre. It does
   not and cannot tell us what became of the body of Christ.

   [223] The author of Supernatural Religion (III. 530), calls to aid even
   Luther's vision of the devil on the Wartburg, and especially the
   apparition of Lord Byron after his death to Sir Walter Scott in clear
   moonshine; and he fancies that in the first century it would have been
   mistaken for reality.

   [224] It is utterly baseless when Ewald and Renan extend these visions
   of Christ for months and years."Ces grands rêves mélancoliques," says
   Renan (Les Apötres, 34, 36), "ces entretiens sans cesse interrompus et
   recommecés avec le mort chéri remplissaient les jours et les mois ....
   Près d'un an s'écoula dans cette vie suspendue entre le ciel et la
   terre. Le charme, loin de décroître, augmentait," etc. Even Keim, III
   598, protests against this view.

   CHAPTER III.

   THE APOSTOLIC AGE
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 20. Sources and Literature of the Apostolic Age.

   I. Sources.

   1. The Canonical Books of the New Testament.--The twenty-seven books of
   the New Testament are better supported than any ancient classic, both
   by a chain of external testimonies which reaches up almost to the close
   of the apostolic age, and by the internal evidence of a spiritual depth
   and unction which raises them far above the best productions of the
   second century. The church has undoubtedly been guided by the Holy
   Spirit in the selection and final determination of the Christian canon.
   But this does, of course, not supersede the necessity of criticism, nor
   is the evidence equally strong in the case of the seven Eusebian
   Antilegomena. The Tübingen and Leyden schools recognized at first only
   five books of the New Testament as authentic, namely, four Epistles of
   Paul-Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians--and the
   Revelation of John. But the progress of research leads more and more to
   positive results, and nearly all the Epistles of Paul now find
   advocates among liberal critics. (Hilgenfeld and Lipsius admit seven,
   adding First Thessalonians, Philippians, and Philemon; Renan concedes
   also Second Thessalonians, and Colossians to be Pauline, thus swelling
   the number of genuine Epistles to nine.) The chief facts and doctrines
   of apostolic Christianity are sufficiently guaranteed even by those
   five documents, which are admitted by the extreme left of modern
   criticism.

   The Acts of the Apostles give us the external, the Epistles the
   internal history of primitive Christianity. They are independent
   contemporaneous compositions and never refer to each other; probably
   Luke never read the Epistles of Paul, and Paul never read the Acts of
   Luke, although he no doubt supplied much valuable information to Luke.
   But indirectly they illustrate and confirm each other by a number of
   coincidences which have great evidential value, all the more as these
   coincidences are undesigned and incidental. Had they been composed by
   post-apostolic writers, the agreement would have been more complete,
   minor disagreements would have been avoided, and the lacunae in the
   Acts supplied, especially in regard to the closing labors and death of
   Peter and Paul.

   The Acts bear on the face all the marks of an original, fresh, and
   trustworthy narrative of contemporaneous events derived from the best
   sources of information, and in great part from personal observation and
   experience. The authorship of Luke, the companion of Paul, is conceded
   by a majority of the best modern scholars, even by Ewald. And this fact
   alone establishes the credibility. Renan (in his St. Paul, ch. 1)
   admirably calls the Acts "a book of joy, of serene ardor. Since the
   Homeric poems no book has been seen full of such fresh sensations. A
   breeze of morning, an odor of the sea, if I dare express it so,
   inspiring something joyful and strong, penetrates the whole book, and
   makes it an excellent compagnon de voyage, the exquisite breviary for
   him who is searching for ancient remains on the seas of the south. This
   is the second idyl of Christianity. The Lake of Tiberias and its
   fishing barks had furnished the first. Now, a more powerful breeze,
   aspirations toward more distant lands, draw us out into the open sea."

   2. The Post-Apostolic and Patristic writings are full of reminiscences
   of, and references to, the apostolic books, and as dependent on them as
   the river is upon its fountain.

   3. The Apocryphal and Heretical literature. The numerous Apocryphal
   Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypses were prompted by the same motives of
   curiosity and dogmatic interest as the Apocryphal Gospels, and have a
   similar apologetic, though very little historical, value. The heretical
   character is, however, more strongly marked. They have not yet been
   sufficiently investigated. Lipsius (in Smith and Wace's, "Dict. of
   Christ. Biog." vol. I. p. 27) divides the Apocryphal Acts into four
   classes: (1) Ebionitic; (2) Gnostic; (3) originally Catholic; (4)
   Catholic adaptations or recensions of heretical documents. The last
   class is the most numerous, rarely older than the fifth century, but
   mostly resting on documents from the second and third centuries.

   (a) Apocryphal Acts: Acta Petri et Pauli (of Ebionite origin, but
   recast), Acta Pauli et Theclae (mentioned by Tertullian at the end of
   the second century, of Gnostic origin), Acta Thomae (Gnostic), Acta
   Matthaei, Acta Thaddei, Martyrium Bartholomaei, Acta Barnabae, Acta
   Andreae, Acta Andreae et Mathiae, Acta Philippi, Acta Johannis, Acta
   Simonis et Judae, Acta Thaddaei, The Doctrine of Addai, the Apostle
   (ed. in Syriac and English by Dr. G. Phillips, London, 1876).

   (b) Apocryphal Epistles: the correspondence between Paul and Seneca
   (six by Paul and eight by Seneca, mentioned by Jerome and Augustine),
   the third Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, Epistolae Mariae,
   Epistolae Petri ad Jacobum.

   (c) Apocryphal Apocalypses: Apocalypsis Johannis, Apocalypsis Petri,
   Apocalypsis Pauli (or anabatikon Paulou, based on the report of his
   rapture into Paradise, 2 Cor. 12:2-4), Apocalypsis Thomae, Apoc.
   Stephani, Apoc. Mariae, Apoc. Mosis, Apoc. Esdrae.

   4. Jewish sources: Philo and Josephus, see § 14, p. 92. Josephus is
   all-important for the history of the Jewish war and the destruction of
   Jerusalem, a.d. 70, which marks the complete rapture of the Christian
   Church with the Jewish synagogue and temple. The apocryphal Jewish, and
   the Talmudic literature supplies information and illustrations of the
   training of the Apostles and the form of their teaching and the
   discipline and worship of the primitive church. Lightfoot, Schöttgen,
   Castelli, Delitzsch, Wünsche, Siegfried, Schürer, and a few others have
   made those sources available for the exegete and historian. Comp. here

   Supernatural Religion. An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine
   Revelation. Lond. 1873, (seventh), "complete ed., carefully revised,"
   1879, 3 vols. This anonymous work is an English reproduction and
   repository of the critical speculations of the Tübingen School of Baur,
   Strauss, Zeller, Schwegler, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, etc. It may be called
   an enlargement of Schwegler's Nachapostolisches Zeitalter. The first
   volume is mostly taken up with a philosophical discussion of the
   question of miracles; the remainder of vol. I. (pp. 212-485) and vol.
   II. contain an historical inquiry into the apostolic origin of the
   canonical Gospels, with a negative result. The third volume discusses
   the Acts, the Epistles and the Apocalypse, and the evidence for the
   Resurrection and Ascension, which are resolved into hallucinations or
   myths. Starting with the affirmation of the antecedent incredibility of
   miracles, the author arrives at the conclusion of their impossibility;
   and this philosophical conclusion determines the historical
   investigation throughout. Dr. Schürer, in the "Theol. Literaturzeitung"
   for 1879, No. 26 (p. 622), denies to this work scientific value for
   Germany, but gives it credit for extraordinary familiarity with recent
   German literature and great industry in collecting historical details.
   Drs. Lightfoot, Sanday, Ezra Abbot, and others have exposed the defects
   of its scholarship, and the false premises from which the writer
   reasons. The rapid sale of the work indicates the extensive spread of
   skepticism and the necessity of fighting over again, on Anglo-American
   ground, the theological battles of Germany and Holland; it is to be
   hoped with more triumphant success.

   W. Sanday: The Gospels in the Second Century. London, 1876. This is
   directed against the critical part of "Supernatural Religion." The
   eighth chapter on Marcion's Gnostic mutilation and reconstruction of
   St. Luke's Gospel (pp. 204 sqq.) had previously appeared in the
   "Fortnightly Review" for June, 1875, and finishes on English soil, a
   controversy which had previously been fought out on German soil, in the
   circle of the Tübingen School. The preposterous hypothesis of the
   priority of Marcion's Gospel was advocated by Ritschl, Baur and
   Schwegler, but refuted by Volkmar and Hilgenfeld, of the same school;
   whereupon Baur and Ritschl honorably abandoned their error. The
   anonymous author of "Supernatural Religion," in his seventh edition,
   has followed their example. The Germans conducted the controversy
   chiefly under its historic and dogmatic aspects; Sanday has added the
   philological and textual argument with the aid of Holtzmann's analysis
   of the style and vocabulary of Luke.

   "Der Schlachtruf, der St. Pauli Brust entsprungen,

   Und welch' ein Friedensecho hat geklungen

   Durch tausend Herzen von Johannis Saiten!

   Wie viele rasche Feuer sind entglommen

   Als Wiederschein von Petri Funkensprühen!

   Und sieht man Andre still mit Opfern kommen,

   Ist's, weil sie in Jakobi Schul'gediehen:--

   Ein Satz ist's, der in Variationen

   Vom ersten Anfang forttönt durch Aeonen."

   (Tholuck.)

   Extent and Environment of the Apostolic Age.

   The apostolic period extends from the Day of Pentecost to the death of
   St. John, and covers about seventy years, from a.d. 30 to 100. The
   field of action is Palestine, and gradually extends over Syria, Asia
   Minor, Greece, and Italy. The most prominent centres are Jerusalem,
   Antioch, and Rome, which represent respectively the mother churches of
   Jewish, Gentile, and United Catholic Christianity. Next to them are
   Ephesus and Corinth. Ephesus acquired a special importance by the
   residence and labors of John, which made themselves felt during the
   second century through Polycarp and Irenaeus. Samaria, Damascus, Joppa,
   Caesarea, Tyre, Cyprus, the provinces of Asia Minor, Troas, Philippi,
   Thessalonica, Beraea, Athens, Crete, Patmos, Malta, Puteoli, come also
   into view as points where the Christian faith was planted. Through the
   eunuch converted by Philip, it reached Candace, the queen of the
   Ethiopians. [225] As early as a.d. 58 Paul could say: "From Jerusalem
   and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel
   of Christ." [226] He afterwards carried it to Rome, where it had
   already been known before, and possibly as far as Spain, the western
   boundary of the empire. [227]

   The nationalities reached by the gospel in the first century were the
   Jews, the Greeks, and the Romans, and the languages used were the
   Hebrew or Aramaic, and especially the Greek, which was at that time the
   organ of civilization and of international intercourse within the Roman
   empire.

   The contemporary secular history includes the reigns of the Roman
   Emperors from Tiberius to Nero and Domitian, who either ignored or
   persecuted Christianity. We are brought directly into contact with King
   Herod Agrippa I. (grandson of Herod the Great), the murderer of the
   apostle, James the Elder; with his son King Agrippa II. (the last of
   the Herodian house), who with his sister Bernice (a most corrupt woman)
   listened to Paul's defense; with two Roman governors, Felix and Festus;
   with Pharisees and Sadducees; with Stoics and Epicureans; with the
   temple and theatre at Ephesus, with the court of the Areopagus at
   Athens, and with Caesar's palace in Rome.

   Sources of Information.

   The author of Acts records the heroic march of Christianity from the
   capital of Judaism to the capital of heathenism with the same artless
   simplicity and serene faith as the Evangelists tell the story of Jesus;
   well knowing that it needs no embellishment, no apology, no subjective
   reflections, and that it will surely triumph by its inherent spiritual
   power.

   The Acts and the Pauline Epistles accompany us with reliable
   information down to the year 63. Peter and Paul are lost out of sight
   in the lurid fires of the Neronian persecution which seemed to consume
   Christianity itself. We know nothing certain of that satanic spectacle
   from authentic sources beyond the information of heathen historians.
   [228] A few years afterwards followed the destruction of Jerusalem,
   which must have made an overpowering impression and broken the last
   ties which bound Jewish Christianity to the old theocracy. The event is
   indeed brought before us in the prophecy of Christ as recorded in the
   Gospels, but for the terrible fulfilment we are dependent on the
   account of an unbelieving Jew, which, as the testimony of an enemy, is
   all the more impressive.

   The remaining thirty years of the first century are involved in
   mysterious darkness, illuminated only by the writings of John. This is
   a period of church history about which we know least and would like to
   know most. This period is the favorite field for ecclesiastical fables
   and critical conjectures. How thankfully would the historian hail the
   discovery of any new authentic documents between the martyrdom of Peter
   and Paul and the death of John, and again between the death of John and
   the age of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus.

   Causes of Success.

   As to the numerical strength of Christianity at the close of the first
   century, we have no information whatever. Statistical reports were
   unknown in those days. The estimate of half a million among the one
   hundred millions or more inhabitants of the Roman empire is probably
   exaggerated. The pentecostal conversion of three thousand in one day at
   Jerusalem, [229] and the "immense multitude" of martyrs under Nero,
   [230] favor a high estimate. The churches in Antioch also, Ephesus, and
   Corinth were strong enough to bear the strain of controversy and
   division into parties. [231] But the majority of congregations were no
   doubt small, often a mere handful of poor people. In the country
   districts paganism (as the name indicates) lingered longest, even
   beyond the age of Constantine. The Christian converts belonged mostly
   to the middle and lower classes of society, such as fishermen,
   peasants, mechanics, traders, freedmen, slaves. St. Paul says: "Not
   many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble were called,
   but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to
   shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world
   that he might put to shame the things that are strong; and the base
   things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose,
   yea, and the things that are not, that he might bring to naught the
   things that are: that no flesh should glory before God." [232] And yet
   these poor, illiterate churches were the recipients of the noblest
   gifts, and alive to the deepest problems and highest thoughts which can
   challenge the attention of an immortal mind. Christianity built from
   the foundation upward. From the lower ranks come the rising men of the
   future, who constantly reinforce the higher ranks and prevent their
   decay.

   At the time of the conversion of Constantine, in the beginning of the
   fourth century, the number of Christians may have reached ten or twelve
   millions, that is about one-tenth of the total population of the Roman
   empire. Some estimate it higher.

   The rapid success of Christianity under the most unfavorable
   circumstances is surprising and its own best vindication. It was
   achieved in the face of an indifferent or hostile world, and by purely
   spiritual and moral means, without shedding a drop of blood except that
   of its own innocent martyrs. Gibbon, in the famous fifteenth chapter of
   his "History," attributes the rapid spread to five causes, namely: (1)
   the intolerant but enlarged religious zeal of the Christians inherited
   from the Jews; (2) the doctrine of the immortality of the soul,
   concerning which the ancient philosophers had but vague and dreamy
   ideas; (3) the miraculous powers attributed to the primitive church;
   (4) the purer but austere morality of the first Christians; (5) the
   unity and discipline of the church, which gradually formed a growing
   commonwealth in the heart of the empire. But every one of these causes,
   properly understood, points to the superior excellency and to the
   divine origin of the Christian religion, and this is the chief cause,
   which the Deistic historian omits.

   Significance of the Apostolic Age.

   The life of Christ is the divine-human fountainhead of the Christian
   religion; the apostolic age is the fountainhead of the Christian
   church, as an organized society separate and distinct from the Jewish
   synagogue. It is the age of the Holy Spirit, the age of inspiration and
   legislation for all subsequent ages.

   Here springs, in its original freshness and purity, the living water of
   the new creation. Christianity comes down front heaven as a
   supernatural fact, yet long predicted and prepared for, and adapted to
   the deepest wants of human nature. Signs and wonders and extraordinary
   demonstrations of the Spirit, for the conversion of unbelieving Jews
   and heathens, attend its entrance into the world of sin. It takes up
   its permanent abode with our fallen race, to transform it gradually,
   without war or bloodshed, by a quiet, leaven-like process, into a
   kingdom of truth and righteousness. Modest and humble, lowly and
   unseemly in outward appearance, but steadily conscious of its divine
   origin and its eternal destiny; without silver or gold, but rich in
   supernatural gifts and powers, strong in faith, fervent in love, and
   joyful in hope; bearing in earthen vessels the imperishable treasures
   of heaven, it presents itself upon the stage of history as the only
   true, the perfect religion, for all the nations of the earth. At first
   an insignificant and even contemptible sect in the eyes of the carnal
   mind, hated and persecuted by Jews and heathens, it confounds the
   wisdom of Greece and the power of Rome, soon plants the standard of the
   cross in the great cities of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and proves
   itself the hope of the world.

   In virtue of this original purity, vigor, and beauty, and the permanent
   success of primitive Christianity, the canonical authority of the
   single but inexhaustible volume of its literature, and the character of
   the apostles, those inspired organs of the Holy Spirit, those untaught
   teachers of mankind, the apostolic age has an incomparable interest and
   importance in the history of the church. It is the immovable groundwork
   of the whole. It has the same regulative force for all the subsequent
   developments of the church as the inspired writings of the apostles
   have for the works of all later Christian authors.

   Furthermore, the apostolic Christianity is preformative, and contains
   the living germs of all the following periods, personages, and
   tendencies. It holds up the highest standard of doctrine and
   discipline; it is the inspiring genius of all true progress; it
   suggests to every age its peculiar problem with the power to solve it.
   Christianity can never outgrow Christ, but it grows in Christ; theology
   cannot go beyond the word of God, but it must ever progress in the
   understanding and application of the word of God. The three leading
   apostles represent not only the three stages of the apostolic church,
   but also as many ages and types of Christianity, and yet they are all
   present in every age and every type. [233]

   The Representative Apostles.

   Peter, Paul, and John stand out most prominently as the chosen Three
   who accomplished the great work of the apostolic age, and exerted, by
   their writings and example, a controlling influence on all subsequent
   ages. To them correspond three centres of influence, Jerusalem,
   Antioch, and Rome.

   Our Lord himself had chosen Three out of the Twelve for his most
   intimate companions, who alone witnessed the Transfiguration and the
   agony in Gethsemane. They fulfilled all the expectations, Peter and
   John by their long and successful labors, James the Elder by drinking
   early the bitter cup of his Master, as the proto-martyr of the Twelve.
   [234] Since his death, a.d. 44, James, "the brother of the Lord" seems
   to have succeeded him, as one of the three "pillars" of the church of
   the circumcision, although he did not belong to the apostles in the
   strict sense of the term, and his influence, as the head of the church
   at Jerusalem, was more local than oecumenical. [235]

   Paul was called last and out of the regular order, by the personal
   appearance of the exalted Lord from heaven, and in authority and
   importance he was equal to any of the three pillars, but filled a place
   of his own, as the independent apostle of the Gentiles. He had around
   him a small band of co-laborers and pupils, such as Barnabas, Silas,
   Titus, Timothy, Luke.

   Nine of the original Twelve, including Matthias, who was chosen in the
   place of Judas, labored no doubt faithfully and effectively, in
   preaching the gospel throughout the Roman empire and to the borders of
   the barbarians, but in subordinate positions, and their labors are
   known to us only from vague and uncertain traditions. [236]

   The labors of James and Peter we can follow in the Acts to the Council
   of Jerusalem, a.d. 50, and a little beyond; those of Paul to his first
   imprisonment in Rome, a.d. 61-63; John lived to the close of the first
   century. As to their last labors we have no authentic information in
   the New Testament, but the unanimous testimony of antiquity that Peter
   and Paul suffered martyrdom in Rome during or after the Neronian
   persecution, and that John died a natural death at Ephesus. The Acts
   breaks off abruptly with Paul still living and working, a prisoner in
   Rome, "preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning
   the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness, none forbidding him." A
   significant conclusion.

   It would be difficult to find three men equally great and good, equally
   endowed with genius sanctified by grace, bound together by deep and
   strong love to the common Master, and laboring for the same cause, yet
   so different in temper and constitution, as Peter, Paul, and John.
   Peter stands out in history as the main pillar of the primitive church,
   as the Rock-apostle, as the chief of the twelve foundation-stones of
   the new Jerusalem; John as the bosom-friend of the Saviour, as the son
   of thunder, as the soaring eagle, as the apostle of love; Paul as the
   champion of Christian freedom and progress, as the greatest missionary,
   with "the care of all the churches" upon his heart, as the expounder of
   the Christian system of doctrine, as the father of Christian theology.
   Peter was a man of action, always in haste and ready to take the lead;
   the first to confess Christ, and the first to preach Christ on the day
   of Pentecost; Paul a man equally potent in word and deed; John a man of
   mystic contemplation. Peter was unlearned and altogether practical;
   Paul a scholar and thinker as well as a worker; John a theosophist and
   seer. Peter was sanguine, ardent, impulsive, hopeful, kind-hearted,
   given to sudden changes, "consistently inconsistent" (to use an
   Aristotelian phrase); Paul was choleric, energetic, bold, noble,
   independent, uncompromising; John some what melancholic, introverted,
   reserved, burning within of love to Christ and hatred of Antichrist.
   Peter's Epistles are full of sweet grace and comfort, the result of
   deep humiliation and rich experience; those of Paul abound in severe
   thought and logical argument, but rising at times to the heights of
   celestial eloquence, as in the seraphic description of love and the
   triumphant paean of the eighth chapter of the Romans; John's writings
   are simple, serene, profound, intuitive, sublime, inexhaustible.

   We would like to know more about the personal relations of these
   pillar-apostles, but must be satisfied with a few hints. They labored
   in different fields and seldom met face to face in their busy life.
   Time was too precious, their work too serious, for sentimental
   enjoyments of friendship. Paul went to Jerusalem a.d. 40, three years
   after his conversion, for the express purpose of making the personal
   acquaintance of Peter, and spent two weeks with him; he saw none of the
   other apostles, but only James, the Lord's brother. [237] He met the
   pillar-apostles at the Conference in Jerusalem, a.d. 50, and concluded
   with them the peaceful concordat concerning the division of labor, and
   the question of circumcision; the older apostles gave him and Barnabas
   "the right hands of fellowship" in token of brotherhood and fidelity.
   [238] Not long afterwards Paul met Peter a third time, at Antioch, but
   came into open collision with him on the great question of Christian
   freedom and the union of Jewish and Gentile converts. [239] The
   collision was merely temporary, but significantly reveals the profound
   commotion and fermentation of the apostolic age, and foreshadowed
   future antagonisms and reconciliations in the church. Several years
   later (a.d. 57) Paul refers the last time to Cephas, and the brethren
   of the Lord, for the right to marry and to take a wife with him on his
   missionary journeys. [240] Peter, in his first Epistle to Pauline
   churches, confirms them in their Pauline faith, and in his second
   Epistle, his last will and testament, he affectionately commends the
   letters of his "beloved brother Paul," adding, however, the
   characteristic remark, which all commentators must admit to be true,
   that (even beside the account of the scene in Antioch) there are in
   them "some things hard to be understood." [241] According to tradition
   (which varies considerably as to details), the great leaders of Jewish
   and Gentile Christianity met at Rome, were tried and condemned
   together, Paul, the Roman citizen, to the death by the sword on the
   Ostian road at Tre Fontane; Peter, the Galilean apostle, to the more
   degrading death of the cross on the hill of Janiculum. John mentions
   Peter frequently in his Gospel, especially in the appendix, [242] but
   never names Paul; he met him, as it seems, only once, at Jerusalem,
   gave him the right hand of fellowship, became his successor in the
   fruitful field of Asia Minor, and built on his foundation.

   Peter was the chief actor in the first stage of apostolic Christianity
   and fulfilled the prophecy of his name in laying the foundation of the
   church among the Jews and the Gentiles. In the second stage he is
   overshadowed by the mighty labors of Paul; but after the apostolic age
   he stands out again most prominent in the memory of the church. He is
   chosen by the Roman communion as its special patron saint and as the
   first pope. He is always named before Paul. To him most of the churches
   are dedicated. In the name of this poor fisherman of Galilee, who had
   neither gold nor silver, and was crucified like a malefactor and a
   slave, the triple-crowned popes deposed kings, shook empires, dispensed
   blessings and curses on earth and in purgatory, and even now claim the
   power to settle infallibly all questions of Christian doctrine and
   discipline for the Catholic world.

   Paul was the chief actor in the second stage of the apostolic church,
   the apostle of the Gentiles, the founder of Christianity in Asia Minor
   and Greece, the emancipator of the new religion from the yoke of
   Judaism, the herald of evangelical freedom, the standard-bearer of
   reform and progress. His controlling influence was felt also in Rome,
   and is clearly seen in the genuine Epistle of Clement, who makes more
   account of him than of Peter. But soon afterwards he is almost
   forgotten, except by name. He is indeed associated with Peter as the
   founder of the church of Rome, but in a secondary line; his Epistle to
   the Romans is little read and understood by the Romans even to this
   day; his church lies outside of the walls of the eternal city, while
   St. Peter's is its chief ornament and glory. In Africa alone he was
   appreciated, first by the rugged and racy Tertullian, more fully by the
   profound Augustine, who passed through similar contrasts in his
   religious experience; but Augustine's Pauline doctrines of sin and
   grace had no effect whatever on the Eastern church, and were
   practically overpowered in the Western church by Pelagian tendencies.
   For a long time Paul's name was used and abused outside of the ruling
   orthodoxy and hierarchy by anti-catholic heretics and sectaries in
   their protest against the new yoke of traditionalism and ceremonialism.
   But in the sixteenth century he celebrated a real resurrection and
   inspired the evangelical reformation. Then his Epistles to the
   Galatians and Romans were republished, explained, and applied with
   trumpet tongues by Luther and Calvin. Then his protest against
   Judaizing bigotry and legal bondage was renewed, and the rights of
   Christian liberty asserted on the largest scale. Of all men in church
   history, St. Augustine not excepted, Martin Luther, once a contracted
   monk, then a prophet of freedom, has most affinity in word and work
   with the apostle of the Gentiles, and ever since Paul's genius has
   ruled the theology and religion of Protestantism. As the gospel of
   Christ was cast out from Jerusalem to bless the Gentiles, so Paul's
   Epistle to the Romans was expelled from Rome to enlighten and to
   emancipate Protestant nations in the distant North and far West.

   St. John, the most intimate companion of Jesus, the apostle of love,
   the seer who looked back to the ante-mundane beginning and forward to
   the post-mundane end of all things, and who is to tarry till the coming
   of the Lord, kept aloof from active part in the controversies between
   Jewish and Gentile Christianity. He appears prominent in the Acts and
   the Epistle to the Galatians, as one of the pillar-apostles, but not a
   word of his is reported. He was waiting in mysterious silence, with a
   reserved force, for his proper time, which did not come till Peter and
   Paul had finished their mission. Then, after their departure, he
   revealed the hidden depths of his genius in his marvellous writings,
   which represent the last and crowning work of the apostolic church.
   John has never been fully fathomed, but it has been felt throughout all
   the periods of church history that he has best understood and portrayed
   the Master, and may yet speak the last word in the conflict of ages and
   usher in an era of harmony and peace. Paul is the heroic captain of the
   church militant, John the mystic prophet of the church triumphant.

   Far above them all, throughout the apostolic age and all subsequent
   ages, stands the one great Master from whom Peter, Paul, and John drew
   their inspiration, to whom they bowed in holy adoration, whom alone
   they served and glorified in life and in death, and to whom they still
   point in their writings as the perfect image of God, as the Saviour
   from sin and death, as the Giver of eternal life, as the divine harmony
   of conflicting creeds and schools, as the Alpha and Omega of the
   Christian faith.

   §22. The Critical Reconstruction of the History of the Apostolic Age.

        "Die Botschaft hör' ich wohl, allein mir fehlt der Glaube."

   (Goethe.)

   Never before in the history of the church has the origin of
   Christianity, with its original documents, been so thoroughly examined
   from standpoints entirely opposite as in the present generation. It has
   engaged the time and energy of many of the ablest scholars and critics.
   Such is the importance and the power of that little book which
   "contains the wisdom of the whole world," that it demands ever new
   investigation and sets serious minds of all shades of belief and
   unbelief in motion, as if their very life depended upon its acceptance
   or rejection. There is not a fact or doctrine which has not been
   thoroughly searched. The whole life of Christ, and the labors and
   writings of the apostles with their tendencies, antagonisms, and
   reconciliations are theoretically reproduced among scholars and
   reviewed under all possible aspects. The post-apostolic age has by
   necessary connection been drawn into the process of investigation and
   placed in a new light.

   The great biblical scholars among the Fathers were chiefly concerned in
   drawing from the sacred records the catholic doctrines of salvation,
   and the precepts for a holy life; the Reformers and older Protestant
   divines studied them afresh with special zeal for the evangelical
   tenets which separated them from the Roman church; but all stood on the
   common ground of a reverential belief in the divine inspiration and
   authority of the Scriptures. The present age is preëminently historical
   and critical. The Scriptures are subjected to the same process of
   investigation and analysis as any other literary production of
   antiquity, with no other purpose than to ascertain the real facts in
   the case. We want to know the precise origin, gradual growth, and final
   completion of Christianity as an historical phenomenon in organic
   connection with contemporary events and currents of thought. The whole
   process through which it passed from the manger in Bethlehem to the
   cross of Calvary, and from the upper room in Jerusalem to the throne of
   the Caesars is to be reproduced, explained and understood according to
   the laws of regular historical development. And in this critical
   process the very foundations of the Christian faith have been assailed
   and undermined, so that the question now is, "to be or not to be." The
   remark of Goethe is as profound as it is true: "The conflict of faith
   and unbelief remains the proper, the only, the deepest theme of the
   history of the world and mankind, to which all others are
   subordinated."

   The modern critical movement began, we may say, about 1830, is still in
   full progress, and is likely to continue to the end of the nineteenth
   century, as the apostolic church itself extended over a period of
   seventy years before it had developed its resources. It was at first
   confined to Germany (Strauss, Baur, and the Tübingen School), then
   spread to France (Renan) and Holland (Scholten, Kuenen), and last to
   England ("Supernatural Religion") and America, so that the battle now
   extends along the whole line of Protestantism.

   There are two kinds of biblical criticism, verbal and historical.

   Textual Criticism.

   The verbal or textual criticism has for its object to restore as far as
   possible the original text of the Greek Testament from the oldest and
   most trustworthy sources, namely, the uncial manuscripts (especially,
   the Vatican and Sinaitic), the ante-Nicene versions, and the patristic
   quotations. In this respect our age has been very successful, with the
   aid of most important discoveries of ancient manuscripts. By the
   invaluable labors of Lachmann, who broke the path for the correct
   theory (Novum Testament. Gr., 1831, large Graeco-Latin edition,
   1842-50, 2 vols.), Tischendorf (8th critical ed., 1869-72, 2 vols.),
   Tregelles (1857, completed 1879), Westcott and Hort (1881, 2 vols.), we
   have now in the place of the comparatively late and corrupt textus
   receptus of Erasmus and his followers (Stephens, Beza, and the
   Elzevirs), which is the basis of au Protestant versions in common use,
   a much older and purer text, which must henceforth be made the basis of
   all revised translations. After a severe struggle between the
   traditional and the progressive schools there is now in this basal
   department of biblical learning a remarkable degree of harmony among
   critics. The new text is in fact the older text, and the reformers are
   in this case the restorers. Far from unsettling the faith in the New
   Testament, the results have established the substantial integrity of
   the text, notwithstanding the one hundred and fifty thousand readings
   which have been gradually gathered from all sources. It is a noteworthy
   fact that the greatest textual critics of the nineteenth century are
   believers, not indeed in a mechanical or magical inspiration, which is
   untenable and not worth defending, but in the divine origin and
   authority of the canonical writings, which rest on fax stronger grounds
   than any particular human theory of inspiration.

   Historical Criticism.

   The historical or inner criticism (which the Germans call the "higher
   criticism," höhere Kritik) deals with the origin, spirit, and aim of
   the New Testament writings, their historical environments, and organic
   place in the great intellectual and religious process which resulted in
   the triumphant establishment of the catholic church of the second
   century. It assumed two very distinct shapes under the lead of Dr.
   Neander in Berlin (d. 1850), and Dr. Baur in Tübingen (d. 1860), who
   labored in the mines of church history at a respectful distance from
   each other and never came into personal contact. Neander and Baur were
   giants, equal in genius and learning, honesty and earnestness, but
   widely different in spirit. They gave a mighty impulse to historical
   study and left a long line of pupils and independent followers who
   carry on the historico-critical reconstruction of primitive
   Christianity. Their influence is felt in France, Holland and England.
   Neander published the first edition of his Apostolic Age in 1832, his
   Life of Jesus (against Strauss) in 1837 (the first volume of his
   General Church History had appeared already in 1825, revised ed. 1842);
   Baur wrote his essay on the Corinthian Parties in 1831, his critical
   investigations on the canonical Gospels in 1844 and 1847, his "Paul" in
   1845 (second ed. by Zeller, 1867), and his "Church History of the First
   Three Centuries" in 1853 (revised 1860). His pupil Strauss had preceded
   him with his first Leben Jesu (1835), which created a greater sensation
   than any of the works mentioned, surpassed only by that of Renan's Vie
   de Jésus, nearly thirty years later (1863). Renan reproduces and
   popularizes Strauss and Baur for the French public with independent
   learning and brilliant genius, and the author of "Supernatural
   Religion" reëchoes the Tübingen and Leyden speculations in England. On
   the other hand Bishop Lightfoot, the leader of conservative criticism;
   declares that he has learnt more from the German Neander than from any
   recent theologian ("Contemp. Review" for 1875, p. 866. Matthew Arnold
   says (Literature and Dogma, Preface, p. xix.): "To get the facts, the
   data, in all matters of science, but notably in theology and Biblical
   learning, one goes to Germany. Germany, and it is her high honor, has
   searched out the facts and exhibited them. And without knowledge of the
   facts, no clearness or fairness of mind can in any study do anything;
   this cannot be laid down too rigidly." But he denies to the Germans
   "quickness and delicacy of perception." Something more is necessary
   than learning and perception to draw the right conclusions from the
   facts: sound common sense and well-balanced judgment. And when we deal
   with sacred and supernatural facts, we need first and last a
   reverential spirit and that faith which is the organ of the
   supernatural. It is here where the two schools depart, without
   difference of nationality; for faith is not a national but an
   individual gift.

   The Two Antagonistic Schools.

   The two theories of the apostolic history, introduced by Neander and
   Baur, are antagonistic in principle and aim, and united only by the
   moral bond of an honest search for truth. The one is conservative and
   reconstructive, the other radical and destructive. The former accepts
   the canonical Gospels and Acts as honest, truthful, and credible
   memoirs of the life of Christ and the labors of the apostles; the
   latter rejects a great part of their contents as unhistorical myths or
   legends of the post-apostolic age, and on the other hand gives undue
   credit to wild heretical romances of the second century. The one draws
   an essential line of distinction between truth as maintained by the
   orthodox church, and error as held by heretical parties; the other
   obliterates the lines and puts the heresy into the inner camp of the
   apostolic church itself. The one proceeds on the basis of faith in God
   and Christ, which implies faith in the supernatural and miraculous
   wherever it is well attested; the other proceeds from disbelief in the
   supernatural and miraculous as a philosophical impossibility, and tries
   to explain the gospel history and the apostolic history from purely
   natural causes like every other history. The one has a moral and
   spiritual as well is intellectual interest in the New Testament, the
   other a purely intellectual and critical interest. The one approaches
   the historical investigation with the subjective experience of the
   divine truth in the heart and conscience, and knows and feels
   Christianity to be a power of salvation from sin and error; the other
   views it simply as the best among the many religions which are destined
   to give way at last to the sovereignty of reason and philosophy. The
   controversy turns on the question whether there is a God in History or
   not; as the contemporaneous struggle in natural science turns on the
   question whether there is a God in nature or not. Belief in a personal
   God almighty and omnipresent in history and in nature, implies the
   possibility of supernatural and miraculous revelation. Absolute freedom
   from prepossession (Voraussetzungslosigkeit such as Strauss demanded)
   is absolutely impossible, "ex nihilo nihil fit." There is prepossession
   on either side of the controversy, the one positive, the other
   negative, and history itself must decide between them. The facts must
   rule philosophy, not philosophy the facts. If it can be made out that
   the life of Christ and the apostolic church can be psychologically and
   historically explained only by the admission of the supernatural
   element which they claim, while every other explanation only increases
   the difficulty, of the problem and substitutes an unnatural miracle for
   a supernatural one, the historian has gained the case, and it is for
   the philosopher to adjust his theory to history. The duty of the
   historian is not to make the facts, but to discover them, and then to
   construct his theory wide enough to give them all comfortable room.

   The Alleged Antagonism in the Apostolic Church.

   The theory of the Tübingen school starts from the assumption of a
   fundamental antagonism between Jewish or primitive Christianity
   represented by Peter, and Gentile or progressive Christianity
   represented by Paul, and resolves all the writings of the New Testament
   into tendency writings (Tendenzschriften), which give us not history
   pure and simple, but adjust it to a doctrinal and practical aim in the
   interest of one or the other party, or of a compromise between the two.
   [243] The Epistles of Paul to the Galatians, Romans, First and Second
   Corinthians--which are admitted to be genuine beyond any doubt, exhibit
   the anti-Jewish and universal Christianity, of which Paul himself must
   be regarded as the chief founder. The Apocalypse, which was composed by
   the apostle John in 69, exhibits the original Jewish and contracted
   Christianity, in accordance with his position as one of the
   "pillar"-apostles of the circumcision (Gal. 2:9), and it is the only
   authentic document of the older apostles.

   Baur (Gesch. der christl. Kirche, I., 80 sqq.) and Renan (St. Paul, ch.
   X.) go so far as to assert that this genuine John excludes Paul from
   the list of the apostles (Apoc. 21:14, which leaves no room for more
   than twelve), and indirectly attacks him as a "false Jew" (Apoc. 2:9;
   3:9), a "false apostle" (2:2), a "false prophet" (2:20), as "Balaam"
   (2:2, 6, 14, 15; comp. Jude 11; 2 Pet. 2:15); just as the Clementine
   Homilies assail him under the name of Simon the Magician and
   arch-heretic. Renan interprets also the whole Epistle of Jude, a
   brother of James, as an attack upon Paul, issued from Jerusalem in
   connection with the Jewish counter-mission organized by James, which
   nearly ruined the work of Paul.

   The other writings of the New Testament are post-apostolic productions
   and exhibit the various phases of a unionistic movement, which resulted
   in the formation of the orthodox church of the second and third
   centuries. The Acts of the Apostles is a Catholic Irenicon which
   harmonizes Jewish and Gentile Christianity by liberalizing Peter and
   contracting or Judaizing Paul, and concealing the difference between
   them; and though probably based on an earlier narrative of Luke, it was
   not put into its present shape before the close of the first century.
   The canonical Gospels, whatever may have been the earlier records on
   which they are based, are likewise post-apostolic, and hence
   untrustworthy as historical narratives. The Gospel of John is a purely
   ideal composition of some unknown Gnostic or mystic of profound
   religious genius, who dealt with the historic Jesus as freely as Plato
   in his Dialogues dealt with Socrates, and who completed with consummate
   literary skill this unifying process in the age of Hadrian, certainly
   not before the third decade of the second century. Baur brought it down
   as late as 170; Hilgenfeld put it further back to 140, Keim to 130,
   Renan to the age of Hadrian.

   Thus the whole literature of the New Testament is represented as the
   living growth of a century, as a collection of polemical and irenical
   tracts of the apostolic and post-apostolic ages. Instead of
   contemporaneous, reliable history we have a series of intellectual
   movements and literary fictions. Divine revelation gives way to
   subjective visions and delusions, inspiration is replaced by
   development, truth by a mixture of truth and error. The apostolic
   literature is put on a par with the controversial literature of the
   Nicene age, which resulted in the Nicene orthodoxy, or with the
   literature of the Reformation period, which led to the formation of the
   Protestant system of doctrine.

   History never repeats itself, yet the same laws and tendencies reappear
   in ever-changing forms. This modern criticism is a remarkable renewal
   of the views held by heretical schools in the second century. The
   Ebionite author of the pseudo-Clementine Homilies and the Gnostic
   Marcion likewise assumed an irreconcilable antagonism between Jewish
   and Gentile Christianity, with this difference, that the former opposed
   Paul as the arch-heretic and defamer of Peter, while Marcion (about
   140) regarded Paul as the only true apostle, and the older apostles as
   Jewish perverters of Christianity; consequently he rejected the whole
   Old Testament and such books of the New Testament as he considered
   Judaizing, retaining in his canon only a mutilated Gospel of Luke and
   ton of the Pauline Epistles (excluding the Pastoral Epistles and the
   Epistle to the Hebrews). In the eyes of modern criticism these wild
   heretics are better historians of the apostolic age than the author of
   the Acts of the Apostles.

   The Gnostic heresy, with all its destructive tendency, had an important
   mission as a propelling force in the ancient church and left its
   effects upon patristic theology. So also this modern gnosticism must be
   allowed to have done great service to biblical and historical learning
   by removing old prejudices, opening new avenues of thought, bringing to
   light the immense fermentation of the first century, stimulating
   research, and compelling an entire scientific reconstruction of the
   history of the origin of Christianity and the church. The result will
   be a deeper and fuller knowledge, not to the weakening but to the
   strengthening of our faith.

   Reaction.

   There is considerable difference among the scholars of this higher
   criticism, and while some pupils of Baur (e.g. Strauss, Volkmar) have
   gone even beyond his positions, others make concessions to the
   traditional views. A most important change took place in Baur's own
   mind as regards the conversion of Paul, which he confessed at last,
   shortly before his death (1860), to be to him an insolvable
   psychological problem amounting to a miracle. Ritschl, Holtzmann,
   Lipsius, Pfleiderer, and especially Reuss, Weizsäcker, and Keim (who
   are as free from orthodox prejudices as the most advanced critics) have
   modified and corrected many of the extreme views of the Tübingen
   school. Even Hilgenfeld, with all his zeal for the
   "Fortschrittstheologie" and against the "Rückschrittstheologie," admits
   seven instead of four Pauline Epistles as genuine, assigns an earlier
   date to the Synoptical Gospels and the Epistle to the Hebrews (which he
   supposes to have been written by Apollos before 70), and says: "It
   cannot be denied that Baur's criticism went beyond the bounds of
   moderation and inflicted too deep wounds on the faith of the church"
   (Hist. Krit. Einleitung in das N. T. 1875, p. 197). Renan admits nine
   Pauline Epistles, the essential genuineness of the Acts, and even the,
   narrative portions of John, while he rejects the discourses as
   pretentious, inflated, metaphysical, obscure, and tiresome! (See his
   last discussion of the subject in L'église chrétienne, ch. I-V. pp. 45
   sqq.) Matthew Arnold and other critics reverse the proposition and
   accept the discourses as the sublimest of all human compositions, full
   of "heavenly glories" (himmlische Herrlichkeiten, to use an expression
   of Keim, who, however, rejects the fourth Gospel altogether). Schenkel
   (in his Christusbild der Apostel, 1879) considerably moderates the
   antagonism between Petrinism and Paulinism, and confesses (Preface, p.
   xi.) that in the progress of his investigations he has been "forced to
   the conviction that the Acts of the Apostles is a more trustworthy
   source of information than is commonly allowed on the part of the
   modern criticism; that older documents worthy of credit, besides the
   well known We-source (Wirquelle) are contained in it; and that the
   Paulinist who composed it has not intentionally distorted the facts,
   but only placed them in the light in which they appeared to him and
   must have appeared to him from the time and circumstances under which
   he wrote. He has not, in my opinion, artificially brought upon the
   stage either a Paulinized Peter, or a Petrinized Paul, in order to
   mislead his readers, but has portrayed the two apostles just as he
   actually conceived of them on the basis of his incomplete information."
   Keim, in his last work (Aus dem Urchristenthum, 1878, a year before his
   death), has come to a similar conclusion, and proves (in a critical
   essay on the Apostelkonvent, pp. 64-89) in opposition to Baur,
   Schwegler, and Zeller, yet from the same standpoint of liberal
   criticism, and allowing later additions, the substantial harmony
   between the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians as regards the
   apostolic conference and concordat of Jerusalem. Ewald always pursued
   his own way and equalled Baur in bold and arbitrary criticism, but
   violently opposed him and defended the Acts and the Gospel of John.

   To these German voices we may add the testimony of Matthew Arnold, one
   of the boldest and broadest of the broad-school divines and critics,
   who with all his admiration for Baur represents him as an "unsafe
   guide," and protests against his assumption of a bitter hatred of Paul
   and the pillar-apostles as entirely inconsistent with the conceded
   religious greatness of Paul and with the nearness of the
   pillar-apostles to Jesus (God and the Bible, 1875, Preface, vii-xii).
   As to the fourth Gospel, which is now the most burning spot of this
   burning controversy, the same author, after viewing it from without and
   from within, comes to the conclusion that it is, "no fancy-piece, but a
   serious and invaluable document, full of incidents given by tradition
   and genuine 'sayings of the Lord' "(p. 370), and that "after the most
   free criticism has been fairly and strictly applied,... there is yet
   left an authentic residue comprising all the profoundest, most
   important, and most beautiful things in the fourth Gospel" (p. 372
   sq.).

   The Positive School.

   While there are signs of disintegration in the ranks of destructive
   criticism, the historic truth and genuineness of the New Testament
   writings have found learned and able defenders from different
   standpoints, such as Neander, Ullmann, C. F. Schmid (the colleague of
   Baur in Tübingen), Rothe, Dorner, Ebrard, Lechler, Lange, Thiersch,
   Wieseler, Hofmann (of Erlangen), Luthardt, Christlieb, Beyschlag,
   Uhlhorn, Weiss, Godet, Edm. de Pressensé.

   The English and American mind also has fairly begun to grapple manfully
   and successfully, with these questions in such scholars as Lightfoot,
   Plumptre, Westcott, Sanday, Farrar, G. P. Fisher, Ezra Abbot (on the
   Authorship of the Fourth Gospel, 1880). English and American theology
   is not likely to be extensively demoralized by these hypercritical
   speculations of the Continent. It has a firmer foothold in an active
   church life and the convictions and affections of the people. The
   German and French mind, like the Athenian, is always bent upon telling
   and hearing something new, while the Anglo-American mind cares more for
   what is true, whether it be old or new. And the truth must ultimately
   prevail.

   St. Paul's Testimony to Historical Christianity.

   Fortunately even the most exacting school of modern criticism leaves us
   a fixed fulcrum from which we can argue the truth of Christianity,
   namely, the four Pauline Epistles to the Galatians, Romans, and
   Corinthians, which are pronounced to be unquestionably genuine and made
   the Archimedean point of assault upon the other parts of the New
   Testament. We propose to confine ourselves to them. They are of the
   utmost historical as well as doctrinal importance; they represent the
   first Christian generation, and were written between 54 and 58, that is
   within a quarter of the century after the crucifixion, when the older
   apostles and most of the principal eye-witnesses of the life of Christ
   were still alive. The writer himself was a contemporary of Christ; he
   lived in Jerusalem at the time of the great events on which
   Christianity rests; he was intimate with the Sanhedrin and the
   murderers of Christ; he was not blinded by favorable prejudice, but was
   a violent persecutor, who had every motive to justify his hostility;
   and after his radical conversion (a.d. 37) he associated with the
   original disciples and could learn their personal experience from their
   own lips (Gal. 1:18; 2:1-11).

   Now in these admitted documents of the best educated of the apostles we
   have the clearest evidence of all the great events and truths of
   primitive Christianity, and a satisfactory answer to the chief
   objections and difficulties of modern skepticism. [244]

   They prove

   1. The leading facts in the life of Christ, his divine mission, his
   birth from a woman, of the royal house of David, his holy life and
   example, his betrayal, passion, and death for the sins of the world,
   his resurrection on the third day, his repeated manifestations to the
   disciples, his ascension and exaltation to the right hand of God,
   whence he will return to judge mankind, the adoration of Christ as the
   Messiah, the Lord and Saviour from sin, the eternal Son of God; also
   the election of the Twelve, the institution of baptism and the Lord's
   Supper, the mission of the Holy Spirit, the founding of the church.
   Paul frequently alludes to these facts, especially the crucifixion and
   resurrection, not in the way of a detailed narrative, but incidentally
   and in connection with doctrinal expositions arid exhortations as
   addressed to men already familiar with them from oral preaching and
   instruction. Comp. Gal 3:13; 4:4-6; 6:14; Rom. 1:3; 4:24, 25; 5:8-21;
   6:3-10; 8:3-11, 26, 39; 9:5; 10:6, 7; 14:5; 15:3 1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2, 12;
   5:7; 6:14; 10:16; 11:23-26; 15:3-8, 45-49; 2 Cor. 5:21.

   2. Paul's own conversion and call to the apostleship by the personal
   appearance to him of the exalted Redeemer from heaven. Gal. 1:1, 15,
   16; 1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8.

   3. The origin and rapid progress of the Christian church in all parts
   of the Roman empire, from Jerusalem to Antioch and Rome, in Judaea, in
   Syria, in Asia Minor, in Macedonia and Achaia. The faith of the Roman
   church, he says, was known "throughout the world," and "in every place
   "there were worshippers of Jesus as their Lord. And these little
   churches maintained a lively and active intercourse with each other,
   and though founded by different teachers and distracted by differences
   of opinion and practice, they worshipped the same divine Lord, and
   formed one brotherhood of believers. Gal. 1:2, 22; 2:1, 11; Rom. 1:8;
   10:18; 16:26; 1 Cor. 1:12; 8:1; 16:19, etc.

   4. The presence of miraculous powers in the church at that time. Paul
   himself wrought the signs and mighty deeds of an apostle. Rom. 15:18,
   19; 1 Cor. 2:4; 9:2; 2 Cor. 12:12. He lays, however, no great stress on
   the outer sensible miracles, and makes more account of the inner moral
   miracles and the constant manifestations of the power of the Holy
   Spirit in regenerating and sanctifying sinful men in an utterly corrupt
   state of society. 1 Cor. 12 to 14; 6:9-11; Gal. 5:16-26; Rom. 6 and 8.

   5. The existence of much earnest controversy in these young churches,
   not indeed about the great facts on which their faith was based, and
   which were fully admitted on both sides, but about doctrinal and ritual
   inferences from these facts, especially the question of the continued
   obligation of circumcision and the Mosaic law, and the personal
   question of the apostolic authority of Paul. The Judaizers maintained
   the superior claims of the older apostles and charged him with a
   radical departure from the venerable religion of their fathers; while
   Paul used against them the argument that the expiatory death of Christ
   and his resurrection were needless and useless if justification came
   from the law. Gal. 2:21; 5:2-4.

   6. The essential doctrinal and spiritual harmony of Paul with the elder
   apostles, notwithstanding their differences of standpoint and field of
   labor. Here the testimony of the Epistle to the Galatians 2:1-10, which
   is the very bulwark of the skeptical school, bears strongly against it.
   For Paul expressly states that the, "pillar"-apostles of the
   circumcision, James, Peter, and John, at the conference in Jerusalem
   a.d. 50, approved the gospel he had been preaching during the preceding
   fourteen years; that they "imparted nothing" to him, gave him no new
   instruction, imposed on him no now terms, nor burden of any kind, but
   that, on the contrary, they recognized the grace of God in him and his
   special mission to the Gentiles, and gave him and Barnabas "the right
   hands of fellowship" in token of their brotherhood and fidelity. He
   makes a clear and sharp distinction between the apostles and "the false
   brethren privily brought in, who came to spy out our liberty which we
   have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage," and to
   whom he would not yield, "no, not for an hour." The hardest words he
   has for the Jewish apostles are epithets of honor; he calls them, the
   pillars of the church, "the men in high repute" (hoi stuloi, hoi
   dokountes, Gal. 2:6, 9); while he considered himself in sincere
   humility "the least of the apostles," because he persecuted the church
   of God (1 Cor. 15:9).

   This statement of Paul makes it simply impossible and absurd to suppose
   (with Baur, Schwegler, Zeller, and Renan) that John should have so
   contradicted and stultified himself as to attack, in the Apocalypse,
   the same Paul whom he had recognized as a brother during his life, as a
   false apostle and chief of the synagogue of Satan after his death. Such
   a reckless and monstrous assertion turns either Paul or John into a
   liar. The antinomian and antichristian heretics of the Apocalypse who
   plunged into all sorts of moral and ceremonial pollutions (Apoc. 2:14,
   15) would have been condemned by Paul as much as by John; yea, he
   himself, in his parting address to the Ephesian elders, had
   prophetically foreannounced and described such teachers as "grievous
   wolves" that would after his departure enter in among them or rise from
   the midst of them, not sparing the flock (Acts 20:29, 30). On the
   question of fornication he was in entire harmony with the teaching of
   the Apocalypse (1 Cor. 3:15, 16; 6:15-20); and as to the question of
   eating meat offered in sacrifice to idols Gr215(rA fi8coX6zvra), though
   he regarded it as a thing indifferent in itself, considering the vanity
   of idols, yet he condemned it whenever it gave offence to the weak
   consciences of the more scrupulous Jewish converts (1 Cor. 8:7-13;
   10:23-33; Rom. 14:2, 21); and this was in accord with the decree of the
   Apostolic Council (Acts 15:29).

   7. Paul's collision with Peter at Antioch, Gal. 2:11-14. which is made
   the very bulwark of the Tübingen theory, proves the very reverse. For
   it was not a difference in principle and doctrine; on the contrary,
   Paul expressly asserts that Peter at first freely and habitually (mark
   the imperfect sunesthien, Gal. 2:12) associated with the Gentile
   converts as brethren in Christ, but was intimidated by emissaries from
   the bigoted Jewish converts in Jerusalem and acted against his better
   conviction which he had entertained ever since the vision at Joppa
   (Acts 10:10-16), and which he had so boldly confessed at the Council in
   Jerusalem (Acts 15:7-11) and carried out in Antioch. We have here the
   same impulsive, impressible, changeable disciple, the first to confess
   and the first to deny his Master, yet quickly returning to him in
   bitter repentance and sincere humility. It is for this inconsistency of
   conduct, which Paul called by the strong term of dissimulation or
   hypocrisy, that he, in his uncompromising zeal for the great principle
   of Christian liberty, reproved him publicly before the church. A public
   wrong had to be publicly rectified. According to the Tübingen
   hypothesis the hypocrisy would have been in the very opposite conduct
   of Peter. The silent submission of Peter on the occasion proves his
   regard for his younger colleague, and speaks as much to his praise as
   his weakness to his blame. That the alienation was only temporary and
   did not break up their fraternal relation is apparent from the
   respectful though frank manner in which, several years after the
   occurrence, they allude to each other as fellow apostles, Comp. Gal.
   1:18, 19; 2:8, 9; 1 Cor. 9:5; 2 Pet. 3:15, 16, and from the fact that
   Mark and Silas were connecting links between them and alternately
   served them both. [245]

   The Epistle to the Galatians then furnishes the proper solution of the
   difficulty, and essentially confirms the account of the Acts. It proves
   the harmony as well as the difference between Paul and the older
   apostles. It explodes the hypothesis that they stood related to each
   other like the Marcionites and Ebionites in the second century. These
   were the descendants of the heretics of the apostolic age, of the
   "false brethren insidiously brought in" (Pseudadelphoi pareisaktoi,
   Gal. 2:4); while the true apostles recognized and continued to
   recognize the same grace of God which wrought effectually through Peter
   for the conversion of the Jews, and through Paul for the conversion of
   the Gentiles. That the Judaizers should have appealed to the Jewish
   apostles, and the antinomian Gnostics to Paul, as their authority, is
   not more surprising than the appeal of the modern rationalists to
   Luther and the Reformation.

   We have thus discussed at the outset, and at some length, the
   fundamental difference of the two standpoints from which the history of
   the apostolic church is now viewed, and have vindicated our own general
   position in this controversy.

   It is not to be supposed that all the obscure points have already been
   satisfactorily cleared up, or ever will be solved beyond the
   possibility of dispute. There must be some room left for faith in that
   God who has revealed himself clearly enough in nature and in history to
   strengthen our faith, and who is concealed enough to try our faith.
   Certain interstellar spaces will always be vacant in the firmament of
   the apostolic age that men may gaze all the more intensely at the
   bright stars, before which the post-apostolic books disappear like
   torches. A careful study of the ecclesiastical writers of the second
   and third centuries, and especially of the numerous Apocryphal Acts,
   Epistles, and Apocalypses, leaves on the mind a strong impression of
   the immeasurable superiority of the New Testament in purity and
   truthfulness, simplicity and majesty; and this superiority points to a
   special agency of the Spirit of God, without which that book of books
   is an inexplicable mystery.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [243] In this respect Baur differs from the standpoint of Strauss, who
   in his first Leben Jesu(1835) bad represented the gospel history as an
   innocent and unconscious myth or poem of the religious imagination of
   the second generation of Christians; but in his second Leben Jesu(1864)
   he somewhat modified his view, and at last (1873) he gave up the whole
   problem as a bad job. A tendency writing implies more or less conscious
   fiction and falsification of history. The Tübingen critics, however,
   try to relieve this fictitious literature of the odious feature by
   referring us to the Jewish and Christian apocryphal literature which
   was passed off under honored names without giving any special offence
   on that score.

   [244] Comp. here a valuable article of J. Oswald Dykes, in the "Brit.
   and For. Evang. Review," Lond. 1880, pp. 51 sqq.

   [245] It is amusing to read Renan's account of this dispute (St. Paul,
   ch. x.). He sympathizes rather with Peter, whom he calls a "man
   profoundly kind and upright and desiring peace above all things,"
   though he admits him to have been amiably weak and inconsistent on that
   as on other occasions; while he charges Paul with stubbornness and
   rudeness; but what is the most important point, he denies the Tübingen
   exegesis when he says: "Modern critics who infer from certain passages
   of the Epistle to the Galatians that the rupture between Peter and Paul
   was absolute, put themselves in contradiction not only to the Acts, but
   to other passages of the Epistle to the Galatians (1:18; 2:2). Fervent
   men pass their lives disputing together without ever falling out. We
   must not judge these characters after the manner of things which take
   place in our day between people well-bred and susceptible in a point of
   honor. This last word especially never had much significance with the
   Jews!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 23. Chronology of the Apostolic Age.

   See the works quoted in § 20 p. 193, 194, especially Wieseler. Comp.
   also, Hackett on Acts, pp. 22 to 30 (third ed.).

   The chronology of the apostolic age is partly certain, at least within
   a few years, partly conjectural: certain as to the principal events
   from a.d. 30 to 70, conjectural as to intervening points and the last
   thirty years of the first century. The sources are the New Testament
   (especially the Acts and the Pauline Epistles), Josephus, and the Roman
   historians. Josephus ( b. 37, d. 103) is especially valuable here, as
   he wrote the Jewish history down to the destruction of Jerusalem.

   The following dates are more or less certain and accepted by most
   historians:

   1. The founding of the Christian Church on the feast of Pentecost in
   May a.d. 30. This is on the assumption that Christ was born b.c. 4 or
   5, and was crucified in April a.d. 30, at an age of thirty-three.

   2. The death of King Herod Agrippa I. a.d. 44 (according to Josephus).
   This settles the date of the preceding martyrdom of James the elder,
   Peter's imprisonment and release Acts 12:2, 23).

   3. The Apostolic Council in Jerusalem, a.d. 50 (Acts 15:1 sqq.; Gal.
   2:1-10). This date is ascertained by reckoning backwards to Paul's
   conversion, and forward to the Caesarean captivity. Paul was probably
   converted in 37, and "fourteen years" elapsed from that event to the
   Council. But chronologists differ on the year of Paul's conversion,
   between 31 and 40. [246]

   4. The dates of the Epistles to the Galatians, Corinthians, and Romans,
   between 56 and 58. The date of the Epistle to the Romans can be fixed
   almost to the month from its own indications combined with the
   statements of the Acts. It was written before the apostle had been in
   Rome, but when he was on the point of departure for Jerusalem and Rome
   on the way to Spain, [247] after having finished his collections in
   Macedonia and Achaia for the poor brethren in Judaea; [248] and he sent
   the epistle through Phebe, a deaconess of the congregation in the
   eastern port of Corinth, where he was at that time. [249] These
   indications point clearly to the spring of the year 58, for in that
   year he was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and carried to Caesarea.

   5. Paul's captivity in Caesarea, a.d. 58 to 60, during the
   procuratorship of Felix and Festus, who changed places in 60 or 61,
   probably in 60. This important date we can ascertain by combination
   from several passages in Josephus, and Tacitus. [250] It enables us at
   the same time, by reckoning backward, to fix some preceding events in
   the life of the apostle.

   6. Paul's first captivity in Rome, a.d. 61 to 63. This follows from the
   former date in connection with the statement in Acts 28:30.

   7. The Epistles of the Roman captivity, Philippians, Ephesians,
   Colossians, and Philemon, a.d. 61-63.

   8. The Neronian persecution, a.d. 64 (the tenth year of Nero, according
   to Tacitus). The martyrdom of Paul and Peter occurred either then, or
   (according to tradition) a few years later. The question depends on the
   second Roman captivity of Paul.

   9. The destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, a.d. 70 (according to
   Josephus and Tacitus).

   10. The death of John after the accession of Trajan, a.d. 98 (according
   to general ecclesiastical tradition).

   The dates of the Synoptical Gospels, the Acts, the Pastoral Epistles,
   the Hebrews, and the Epistles of Peter, James, and Jude cannot be
   accurately ascertained except that they were composed before the
   destruction of Jerusalem, mostly between 60 and 70. The writings of
   John were written after that date and towards the close of the first
   century, except the Apocalypse, which some of the best scholars, from
   internal indications assign to the year 68 or 69, between the death of
   Nero and the destruction of Jerusalem.

   The ascension of Christ to heaven was followed ten days afterwards by
   the descent of the Holy Spirit upon earth and the birth of the
   Christian Church. The Pentecostal event was the necessary result of the
   Passover event. It could never have taken place without the preceding
   resurrection and ascension. It was the first act of the mediatorial
   reign of the exalted Redeemer in heaven, and the beginning of an
   unbroken series of manifestations in fulfilment of his promise to be
   with his people "alway, even unto the end of the world." For his
   ascension was only a withdrawal of his visible local presence, and the
   beginning of his spiritual omnipresence in the church which is "his
   body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all." The Easter miracle
   and the Pentecostal miracle are continued and verified by the daily
   moral miracles of regeneration and sanctification throughout
   Christendom.

   We have but one authentic account of that epoch-making event, in the
   second chapter of Acts, but in the parting addresses of our Lord to his
   disciples the promise of the Paraclete who should lead them into the
   whole truth is very prominent, [252] and the entire history of the
   apostolic church is illuminated and heated by the Pentecostal fire.
   [253]

   Pentecost, i.e. the fiftieth day after the Passover-Sabbath, [254] was
   a feast of joy and gladness, in the loveliest season of the year, and
   attracted a very large number of visitors to Jerusalem from foreign
   lands. [255] It was one of the three great annual festivals of the Jews
   in which all the males were required to appear before the Lord.
   Passover was the first, and the feast of Tabernacles the third.
   Pentecost lasted one day, but the foreign Jews, after the period of the
   captivity, prolonged it to two days. It was the "feast of harvest," or
   "of the first fruits," and also (according to rabbinical tradition) the
   anniversary celebration of the Sinaitic legislation, which is supposed
   to have taken place on the fiftieth day after the Exodus from the land
   of bondage. [256]

   This festival was admirably adapted for the opening event in the
   history of the apostolic church. It pointed typically to the first
   Christian harvest, and the establishment of the new theocracy in
   Christ; as the sacrifice of the paschal lamb and the exodus from Egypt
   foreshadowed the redemption of the world by the crucifixion of the Lamb
   of God. On no other day could the effusion of the Spirit of the exalted
   Redeemer produce such rich results and become at once so widely known.
   We may trace to this day not only the origin of the mother church at
   Jerusalem, but also the conversion of visitors from other cities, as
   Damascus, Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome, who on their return would
   carry the glad tidings to their distant homes. For the strangers
   enumerated by Luke as witnesses of the great event, represented nearly
   all the countries in which Christianity was planted by the labors of
   the apostles. [257]

   The Pentecost in the year of the Resurrection was the last Jewish (i.e.
   typical) and the first Christian Pentecost. It became the spiritual
   harvest feast of redemption from sin, and the birthday of the visible
   kingdom of Christ on earth. It marks the beginning of the dispensation
   of the Spirit, the third era in the history of the revelation of the
   triune God. On this day the Holy Spirit, who had hitherto wrought only
   sporadically and transiently, took up his permanent abode in mankind as
   the Spirit of truth and holiness, with the fulness of saving grace, to
   apply that grace thenceforth to believers, and to reveal and glorify
   Christ in their hearts, as Christ had revealed and glorified the
   Father.

   While the apostles and disciples, about one hundred and twenty (ten
   times twelve) in number, no doubt mostly Galilaeans, [258] were
   assembled before the morning devotions of the festal day, and were
   waiting in prayer for the fulfilment of the promise, the exalted
   Saviour sent from his heavenly throne the Holy Spirit upon them, and
   founded his church upon earth. The Sinaitic legislation was accompanied
   by "thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the
   voice of the trumpet exceeding loud, and all the people that was in the
   camp trembled." [259] The church of the new covenant war, ushered into
   existence with startling signs which filled the spectators with wonder
   and fear. It is quite natural, as Neander remarks, that "the greatest
   miracle in the inner life of mankind should have been accompanied by
   extraordinary outward phenomena as sensible indications of its
   presence." A supernatural sound resembling that of a rushing mighty
   wind, [260] came down from heaven and filled the whole house in which
   they were assembled; and tongues like flames of fire, distributed
   themselves among them, alighting for a while on each head. [261] It is
   not said that these phenomena were really wind and fire, they are only
   compared to these elements, [262] as the form which the Holy Spirit
   assumed at the baptism of Christ is compared to a dove. [263] The
   tongues of flame were gleaming, but neither burning nor consuming; they
   appeared and disappeared like electric sparks or meteoric flashes. But
   these audible and visible signs were appropriate symbols of the
   purifying, enlightening, and quickening power of the Divine Spirit, and
   announced a new spiritual creation. The form of tongues referred to the
   glossolalia, and the apostolic eloquence as a gift of inspiration.

   "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit." This is the real
   inward miracle, the main fact, the central idea of the Pentecostal
   narrative. To the apostles it was their baptism, confirmation, and
   ordination, all in one, for they received no other. [264] To them it
   was the great inspiration which enabled them hereafter to be
   authoritative teachers of the gospel by tongue and pen. Not that it
   superseded subsequent growth in knowledge, or special revelations on
   particular points (as Peter receive at Joppa, and Paul on several
   occasions); but they were endowed with such an understanding of
   Christ's words and plan of salvation as they never had before. What was
   dark and mysterious became now clear and full of meaning to them. The
   Spirit revealed to them the person and work of the Redeemer in the
   light of his resurrection and exaltation, and took full possession of
   their mind and heart. They were raised, as it were, to the mount of
   transfiguration, and saw Moses and Elijah and Jesus above them, face to
   face, swimming in heavenly light. They had now but one desire to
   gratify, but one object to live for, namely, to be witnesses of Christ
   and instruments of the salvation of their fellow-men, that they too
   might become partakers of their "inheritance incorruptible, and
   undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven." [265]

   But the communication of the Holy Spirit was not confined to the
   Twelve. It extended to the brethren of the Lord, the mother of Jesus,
   the pious women who had attended his ministry, and the whole
   brotherhood of a hundred and twenty souls who were assembled in that
   chamber. [266] They were "all" filled with the Spirit, and all spoke
   with tongues; [267] and Peter saw in the event the promised outpouring
   of the Spirit upon "all flesh," sons and daughters, young men and old
   men, servants and handmaidens. [268] It is characteristic that in this
   spring season of the church the women were sitting with the men, not in
   a separate court as in the temple, nor divided by a partition as in the
   synagogue and the decayed churches of the East to this day, but in the
   same room as equal sharers in the spiritual blessings. The beginning
   was a prophetic anticipation of the end, and a manifestation of the
   universal priesthood and brotherhood of believers in Christ, in whom
   all are one, whether Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or female. [269]

   This new spiritual life, illuminated, controlled, and directed by the
   Holy Spirit, manifested itself first in the speaking with tongues
   towards God, and then in the prophetic testimony towards the people.
   The former consisted of rapturous prayers and anthems of praise, the
   latter of sober teaching and exhortation. From the Mount of
   Transfiguration the disciples, like their Master, descended to the
   valley below to heal the sick and to call sinners to repentance.

   The mysterious gift of tongues, or glossolalia, appears here for the
   first time, but became, with other extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, a
   frequent phenomenon in the apostolic churches, especially at Corinth,
   and is fully described by Paul. The distribution of the flaming tongues
   to each of the disciples caused the speaking with tongues. A new
   experience expresses itself always in appropriate language. The
   supernatural experience of the disciples broke through the confines of
   ordinary speech and burst out in ecstatic language of praise and
   thanksgiving to God for the great works he did among them. [270] It was
   the Spirit himself who gave them utterance and played on their tongues,
   as on new tuned harps, unearthly melodies of praise. The glossolalia
   was here, as in all cases where it is mentioned, an act of worship and
   adoration, not an act of teaching and instruction, which followed
   afterwards in the sermon of Peter. It was the first Te Deum of the
   new-born church. It expressed itself in unusual, poetic, dithyrambic
   style and with a peculiar musical intonation. It was intelligible only
   to those who were in sympathy with the speaker; while unbelievers
   scoffingly ascribed it to madness or excess of wine. Nevertheless it
   served as a significant sign to all and arrested their attention to the
   presence of a supernatural power. [271]

   So far we may say that the Pentecostal glossolalia was the same as that
   in the household of Cornelius in Caesarea after his conversion, which
   may be called a Gentile Pentecost, [272] as that of the twelve
   disciples of John the Baptist at Ephesus, where it appears in
   connection with prophesying, [273] and as that in the Christian
   congregation at Corinth. [274]

   But at its first appearance the speaking with tongues differed in its
   effect upon the hearers by coming home to them at once in their own
   mother-tongues; while in Corinth it required an interpretation to be
   understood. The foreign spectators, at least a number of them, believed
   that the unlettered Galilaeans spoke intelligibly in the different
   dialects represented on the occasion. [275] We must therefore suppose
   either that the speakers themselves, were endowed, at least
   temporarily, and for the particular purpose of proving their divine
   mission, with the gift of foreign languages not learned by them before,
   or that the Holy Spirit who distributed the tongues acted also as
   interpreter of the tongues, and applied the utterances of the speakers
   to the susceptible among the hearers.

   The former is the most natural interpretation of Luke's language.
   Nevertheless I suggest the other alternative as preferable, for the
   following reasons: 1. The temporary endowment with a supernatural
   knowledge of foreign languages involves nearly all the difficulties of
   a permanent endowment, which is now generally abandoned, as going far
   beyond the data of the New Testament and known facts of the early
   spread of the gospel. 2. The speaking with tongues began before the
   spectators arrived, that is before there was any motive for the
   employment of foreign languages. [276] 3. The intervening agency of the
   Spirit harmonizes the three accounts of Luke, and Luke and Paul, or the
   Pentecostal and the Corinthian glossolalia; the only difference
   remaining is that in Corinth the interpretation of tongues was made by
   men in audible speech, [277] in Jerusalem by the Holy Spirit in inward
   illumination and application. 4. The Holy Spirit was certainly at work
   among the hearers as well as the speakers, and brought about the
   conversion of three thousand on that memorable day. If he applied and
   made effective the sermon of Peter, why not also the preceding
   doxologies and benedictions? 5. Peter makes no allusion to foreign
   languages, nor does the prophecy of Joel which he quotes. 6. This view
   best explains the opposite effect upon the spectators. They did by no
   means all understand the miracle, but the mockers, like those at
   Corinth, [278] thought the disciples were out of their right mind and
   talked not intelligible words in their native dialects, but
   unintelligible nonsense. The speaking in a foreign language could not
   have been a proof of drunkenness. It may be objected to this view that
   it implies a mistake on the part of the hearers who traced the use of
   their mother-tongues directly to the speakers; but the mistake referred
   not to the fact itself, but only to the mode. It was the same Spirit
   who inspired the tongues of the speakers and the hearts of the
   susceptible hearers, and raised both above the ordinary level of
   consciousness.

   Whichever view we take of this peculiar feature of the Pentecostal
   glossolalia, in this diversified application to the cosmopolitan
   multitude of spectators, it was a symbolical anticipation and prophetic
   announcement of the universalness of the Christian religion, which was
   to be proclaimed in all the languages of the earth and to unite all
   nations in one kingdom of Christ. The humility and love of the church
   united what the pride and hatred of Babel had scattered. In this sense
   we may say that the Pentecostal harmony of tongues was the counterpart
   of the BabyIonian confusion of tongues.. [279]

   The speaking with tongues was followed by the sermon of Peter; the act
   of devotion, by an act of teaching; the rapturous language of the soul
   in converse with God, by the sober words of ordinary self-possession
   for the benefit of the people.

   While the assembled multitude wondered at this miracle with widely
   various emotions, St. Peter, the Rock-man, appeared in the name of all
   the disciples, and addressed them with remarkable clearness and force,
   probably in his own vernacular Aramaic, which would be most familiar to
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem, possibly in Greek, which would be better
   understood by the foreign visitors. [280] He humbly condescended to
   refute the charge of intoxication by reminding them of the early hour
   of the day, when even drunkards are sober, and explained from the
   prophecies of Joel and the sixteenth Psalm of David the meaning of the
   supernatural phenomenon, as the work of that Jesus of Nazareth, whom
   the Jews had crucified, but who was by word and deed, by his
   resurrection from the dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God,
   and the effusion of the Holy Ghost, accredited as the promised Messiah,
   according to the express prediction of the Scripture. Then he called
   upon his hearers to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus, as the
   founder and head of the heavenly kingdom, that even they, though they
   had crucified him, the Lord and the Messiah, might receive the
   forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost, whose wonderful
   workings they saw and heard in the disciples.

   This was the first independent testimony of the apostles, the first
   Christian sermon: simple, unadorned, but full of Scripture truth,
   natural, suitable, pointed, and more effective than any other sermon
   has been since, though fraught with learning and burning with
   eloquence. It resulted in the conversion and baptism of three thousand
   persons, gathered as first-fruits into the garners of the church.

   In these first-fruits of the glorified Redeemer, and in this founding
   of the new economy of Spirit and gospel, instead of the old theocracy
   of letter and law, the typical meaning of the Jewish Pentecost was
   gloriously fulfilled. But this birth-day of the Christian church is in
   its turn only the beginning, the type and pledge, of a still greater
   spiritual harvest and a universal feast of thanksgiving, when, in the
   full sense of the prophecy of Joel, the Holy Spirit shall be poured out
   on all flesh, when all the sons and daughters of men shall walk in his
   light, and God shall be praised with new tongues of fire for the
   completion of his wonderful work of redeeming love.

   Notes.

   I. Glossolalia.--The Gift of Tongues is the most difficult feature of
   the Pentecostal miracle. Our only direct source of information is in
   Acts 2, but the gift itself is mentioned in two other passages, 10:46
   and 19:6, in the concluding section of Mark 16 (of disputed
   genuineness), and fully described by Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14.
   There can be no doubt as to the existence of that gift in the apostolic
   age, and if we had only either the account of Pentecost, or only the
   account of Paul, we would not hesitate to decide as to its nature, but
   the difficulty is in harmonizing the two.

   (1) The terms employed for the strange tongues are "new tongues"
   (kainai glossai, Mark 16:17, where Christ promises the gift), "other
   tongues," differing from ordinary tongues (heterai gl. Acts 2:4, but
   nowhere else), "kinds" or "diversities of tongues" (gene glosson, 1
   Cor. 12:28), or simply, "tongues" (glossai,1 Cor. 14:22), and in the
   singular, "tongue" (glossa, 14:2, 13, 19, 27, in which passages the E.
   V. inserts the interpolation "unknown tongue"). To speak in tongues is
   called glossaisorglosse lalein(Acts 2:4; 10:46; 19:6; 1 Cor. 14:2, 4,
   13, 14, 19, 27). Paul uses also the phrase to "pray with the tongue"
   (proseuchesthai glosse), as equivalent to "praying and singing with the
   spirit" (Proseuchesthai andpsallein to pneumati, and as distinct from
   proseuchesthaiand psallein to noi, 1 Cor. 14:14, 15). The plural and
   the term "diversities" of tongues, as well as the distinction between
   tongues of "angels" and tongues of "men" (1 Cor. 13:1) point to
   different manifestations (speaking, praying, singing), according to the
   individuality, education, and mood of the speaker, but not to various
   foreign languages, which are excluded by Paul's description.

   The term tongue has been differently explained.

   (a) Wieseler (and Van Hengel): the organ of speech, used as a passive
   instrument; speaking with the tongue alone, inarticulately, and in a
   low whisper. But this does not explain the plural, nor the terms "new"
   and "other" tongues; the organ of speech remaining the same.

   (b) Bleek: rare, provincial, archaic, poetic words, or glosses (whence
   our "glossary"). But this technical meaning of glossaioccurs only in
   classical writers (as Aristotle, Plutarch, etc.) and among grammarians,
   not in Hellenistic Greek, and the interpretation does not suit the
   singular glossaand glosse lalein, as glossacould only mean a single
   gloss.

   (c) Most commentators: language or dialect (dialektos, comp. Acts 1:19;
   2:6, 8; 21:40; 26:14). This is the correct view. "Tongue" is an
   abridgment for "new tongue" (which was the original term, Mark 16:17).
   It does not necessarily mean one of the known languages of the earth,
   but may mean a peculiar handling of the vernacular dialect of the
   speaker, or a new spiritual language never known before, a language of
   immediate inspiration in a state of ecstasy. The "tongues" were
   individual varieties of this language of inspiration.

   (2) The glossolalia in the Corinthian church, with which that at
   Caesarea in Acts 10:46, and that at Ephesus, 19:6, are evidently
   identical, we know very well from the description of Paul. It occurred
   in the first glow of enthusiasm after conversion and continued for some
   time. It was not a speaking in foreign languages, which would have been
   entirely useless in a devotional meeting of converts, but a speaking in
   a language differing from all known languages, and required an
   interpreter to be intelligible to foreigners. It had nothing to do with
   the spread of the gospel, although it may, like other devotional acts,
   have become a means of conversion to susceptible unbelievers if such
   were present. It was an act of self-devotion, an act of thanksgiving,
   praying, and singing, within the Christian congregation, by individuals
   who were wholly absorbed in communion with God, and gave utterance to
   their rapturous feelings in broken, abrupt, rhapsodic, unintelligible
   words. It was emotional rather than intellectual, the language of the
   excited imagination, not of cool reflection. It was the language of the
   spirit (pneuma) or of ecstasy, as distinct from the language of the
   understanding (nous). We might almost illustrate the difference by a
   comparison of the style of the Apocalypse which was conceiveden
   pneumati(Apoc. 1:10) with that of the Gospel of John, which was written
   en noi. The speaker in tongues was in a state of spiritual
   intoxication, if we may use this term, analogous to the poetic "frenzy"
   described by Shakespeare and Goethe. His tongue was a lyre on which the
   divine Spirit played celestial tunes. He was unconscious or only half
   conscious, and scarcely knew whether he was, "in the body or out of the
   body." No one could understand this unpremeditated religious rhapsody
   unless he was in a similar trance. To an unbelieving outsider it
   sounded like a barbarous tongue, like the uncertain sound of a trumpet,
   like the raving of a maniac (1 Cor. 14:23), or the incoherent talk of a
   drunken man (Acts 2:13, 15). "He that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not
   to men, but to God; for no one understandeth; and in the spirit he
   speaketh mysteries; but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men
   edification, and encouragement, and comfort. He that speaketh in a
   tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church"
   (1 Cor. 14:2-4; comp. 26-33).

   The Corinthians evidently overrated the glossolalia, as a showy display
   of divine power; but it was more ornamental than useful, and vanished
   away with the bridal season of the church. It is a mark of the great
   wisdom of Paul who was himself a master in the glossolalia (1 Cor.
   14:18), that he assigned to it a subordinate and transient position,
   restrained its exercise, demanded an interpretation of it, and gave the
   preference to the gifts of permanent usefulness in which God displays
   his goodness and love for the general benefit. Speaking with tongues is
   good, but prophesying and teaching in intelligible speech for the
   edification of the congregation is better, and love to God and men in
   active exercise is best of all (1 Cor. 13).

   We do not know how long the glossolalia, as thus described by Paul,
   continued. It passed away gradually with the other extraordinary or
   strictly supernatural gifts of the apostolic age. It is not mentioned
   in the Pastoral, nor in the Catholic Epistles. We have but a few
   allusions to it at the close of the second century. Irenaeus (Adv.
   Haer. 1. v. c. 6, § 1) speaks of "many brethren" whom he heard in the
   church having the gift of prophecy and of speaking in "diverse tongues"
   (Pantodapais glossais), bringing the hidden things of men (Ta kpuphia
   ton anthpopon) to light and expounding the mysteries of God (ta
   musteria tou theou). It is not clear whether by the term "diverse,"
   which does not elsewhere occur, he means a speaking in foreign
   languages, or in diversities of tongues altogether peculiar, like those
   meant by Paul. The latter is more probable. Irenaeus himself had to
   learn the language of Gaul. Tertullian (Adv. Marc. V. 8; comp. De
   Anima, c. 9) obscurely speaks of the spiritual gifts, including the
   gift of tongues, as being still manifest among the Montanists to whom
   he belonged. At the time of Chrysostom it had entirely disappeared; at
   least he accounts for the obscurity of the gift from our ignorance of
   the fact. From that time on the glossolalia was usually misunderstood
   as a miraculous and permanent gift of foreign languages for missionary
   purposes. But the whole history of missions furnishes no clear example
   of such a gift for such a purpose.

   Analogous phenomena, of an inferior kind, and not miraculous, yet
   serving as illustrations, either by approximation or as counterfeits,
   reappeared from time to time in seasons of special religious
   excitement, as among the Camisards and the prophets of the Cevennes in
   France, among the early Quakers and Methodists, the Mormons, the
   Readers ("Läsare") in Sweden in 1841 to 1843, in the Irish revivals of
   1859, and especially in the "Catholic Apostolic Church," commonly
   called Irvingites, from 1831 to 1833, and even to this day. See Ed.
   Irving's articles on Gifts of the Holy Ghost called Supernatural, in
   his "Works," vol. V., p. 509, etc.; Mrs. Oliphant's Life of Irving,
   vol. II.; the descriptions quoted in my Hist. Ap. Ch. § 55, p. 198; and
   from friend and foe in Stanley's Com. on Corinth., p. 252, 4th ed.;
   also Plumptre in Smith's, "Bible Dict.," IV. 3311, Am. ed. The
   Irvingites who have written on the subject (Thiersch, Böhm, and
   Rossteuscher) make a marked distinction between the Pentecostal
   glossolalia in foreign languages and the Corinthian glossolalia in
   devotional meetings; and it is the latter only which they compare to
   their own experience. Several years ago I witnessed this phenomenon in
   an Irvingite congregation in New York; the words were broken,
   ejaculatory and unintelligible, but uttered in abnormal, startling,
   impressive sounds, in a state of apparent unconsciousness and rapture,
   and without any control over the tongue, which was seized as it were by
   a foreign power. A friend and colleague (Dr. Briggs), who witnessed it
   in 1879 in the principal Irvingite church at London, received the same
   impression.

   (3) The Pentecostal glossolalia cannot have been essentially different
   from the Corinthian: it was likewise an ecstatic act of worship, of
   thanksgiving and praise for the great deeds of God in Christ, a
   dialogue of the soul with God. It was the purest and the highest
   utterance of the jubilant enthusiasm of the new-born church of Christ
   in the possession of the Holy Spirit. It began before the spectators
   arrived (comp. Acts 2:4 and 6), and was followed by a missionary
   discourse of Peter in plain, ordinary language. Luke mentions the same
   gift twice again (Luke 10 and 19) evidently as an act of devotion, and
   not of teaching.

   Nevertheless, according to the evident meaning of Luke's narrative, the
   Pentecostal glossolalia differed from the Corinthian not only by its
   intensity, but also by coming home to the hearers then present in their
   own vernacular dialects, without the medium of a human interpreter.
   Hence the term "different" tongues, which Paul does not use, nor Luke
   in any other passage; hence the astonishment of the foreigners at
   hearing each his own peculiar idiom from the lips of those unlettered
   Galileans. It is this heteroglossolalia, as I may term it, which causes
   the chief difficulty. I will give the various views which either deny,
   or shift, or intensify, or try to explain this foreign element.

   (a) The rationalistic interpretation cuts the Gordian knot by denying
   the miracle, as a mistake of the narrator or of the early Christian
   tradition. Even Meyer surrenders the heteroglossolalia, as far as it
   differs from the Corinthian glossolalia, as an unhistorical tradition
   which originated in a mistake, because he considers the sudden
   communication of the facility of speaking foreign languages as
   "logically impossible, and psychologically and morally inconceivable"
   (Com. on Acts 2:4, 4th ed.). But Luke, the companion of Paul, must have
   been familiar with the glossolalia in the apostolic churches, and in
   the two other passages where he mentions it he evidently means the same
   phenomenon as that described by Paul.

   (b) The heteroglossolalia was a mistake of the hearers (a Hörwunder),
   who in the state of extraordinary excitement and profound sympathy
   imagined that they heard their own language from the disciples; while
   Luke simply narrates their impression without correcting it. This view
   was mentioned (though not adopted) by Gregory of Nyssa, and held by
   Pseudo-Cyprian, the venerable Bede, Erasmus, Schneckenburger and
   others. If the pentecostal language was the Hellenistic dialect, it
   could, with its composite character, its Hebraisms and Latinisms, the
   more easily produce such an effect when spoken by persons stirred in
   the inmost depth of their hearts and lifted out of themselves. St.
   Xavier is said to have made himself understood by the Hindoos without
   knowing their language, and St. Bernard, St. Anthony of Padua, St.
   Vincent Ferrer were able, by the spiritual power of their eloquence, to
   kindle the enthusiasm and sway the passions of multitudes who were
   ignorant of their language. Olshausen and Bäumlein call to aid the
   phenomena of magnetism and somnambulism, by which people are brought
   into mysterious rapport.

   (c) The glossolalia was speaking in archaic, poetic glosses, with an
   admixture of foreign words. This view, learnedly defended by Bleek
   (1829), and adopted with modifications by Baur (1838), has already been
   mentioned above (p. 233), as inconsistent with Hellenistic usage, and
   the natural meaning of Luke.

   (d) The mystical explanation regards the Pentecostal Gift of Tongues in
   some way as a counterpart of the Confusion of Tongues, either as a
   temporary restoration of the original language of Paradise, or as a
   prophetic anticipation of the language of heaven in which all languages
   are united. This theory, which is more deep than clear, turns the
   heteroglossolalia into a homoglossolalia, and puts the miracle into the
   language itself and its temporary restoration or anticipation.
   Schelling calls the Pentecostal miracle "Babel reversed" (das
   umgekehrte Babel), and says: "Dem Ereigniss der Sprachenverwirrung
   lässt sich in der ganzen Folge der religiösen Geschichte nur Eines an
   die Seite stellen, die momentan wiederhergestellte Spracheinheit
   (homoglossia) am Pfingstfeste, mit dem das Christenthum, bestimmt das
   ganze Menschengeschlecht durch die Erkenntniss des Einen wahren Gottes
   wieder zur Einheit zu verknüpfen, seinen grossen Weg beginnt " (Einl.
   in d. Philos. der Mythologie, p. 109). A similar view was defended by
   Billroth (in his Com. on 1 Cor. 14, p. 177), who suggests that the
   primitive language combined elements of the different derived
   languages, so that each listener heard fragments of his own. Lange (II.
   38) sees here the normal language of the inner spiritual life which
   unites the redeemed, and which runs through all ages of the church as
   the leaven of languages, regenerating, transforming, and consecrating
   them to sacred uses, but he assumes also, like Olshausen, a sympathetic
   rapport between speakers and hearers. Delitzsch (l.c. p. 1186) says:
   "Die apostolische Verkündigung erging damals in einer Sprache des
   Geistes, welche das Gegenbild der in Babel zerschellten
   EinenMenschheitssprache war und von allen ohne Unterschied der Sprachen
   gleichmässig verstanden wurde. Wie das weisse Licht alle Farben aus
   sich erschliesst, so fiel die geistgewirkte Apostelsprache wie in
   prismatischer Brechung verständlich in aller Ohren und ergreifend in
   aller Herzen. Es war ein Vorspiel der Einigung, in welcher die von
   Babel datirende Veruneinigung sich aufheben wird. Dem Sivan-Tag des
   steinernen Buchstabens trat ein Sivan-Tag des lebendigmachenden Geistes
   entgegen. Es war der Geburtstag der Kirche, der Geistesgemeinde im
   Unterschiede von der altestamentlichen Volksgemeinde; darum nennt
   Chrysostomus in einer Pfingsthomilie die Pentekoste die Metropole der
   Feste " Ewald's view (VI. 116 sqq.) is likewise mystical, but original
   and expressed with his usual confidence. He calls the glossolalia an
   "Auflallen und Aufjauchzen der Christlichen Begeisterung, ein
   stürmisches Hervorbrechen aller der verborgenen Gefühle und Gedanken in
   ihrer vollsten Unmittelbarkeit und Gewalt " He says that on the day of
   Pentecost the most unusual expressions and synonyms of different
   languages (as abba ho pater, Gal. 4:6; Rom. 8:15, and maran atha1 Cor.
   16:22), with reminiscences of words of Christ as resounding from
   heaven, commingled in the vortex of a new language of the Spirit, and
   gave utterance to the exuberant joy of the young Christianity in
   stammering hymns of praise never heard before or since except in the
   weaker manifestations of the same gift in the Corinthian and other
   apostolic churches.

   (e) The Pentecostal glossolalia was a permanent endowment of the
   apostles with a miraculous knowledge of all those foreign languages in
   which they were to preach the gospel. As they were sent to preach to
   all nations, they were gifted with the tongues of all nations. This
   theory was first clearly brought out by the fathers in the fourth and
   fifth centuries, long after the gift of tongues had disappeared, and
   was held by most of the older divines, though with different
   modifications, but is now abandoned by nearly all Protestant
   commentators except Bishop Wordsworth, who defends it with patristic
   quotations. Chrysostom supposed that each disciple was assigned the
   particular language which he needed for his evangelistic work (Hom. on
   Acts 2). Augustine went much further, saying (De Civ. Dei, XVIII. c.
   49): "Every one of them spoke in the tongues of all nations; thus
   signifying that the unity of the catholic church would embrace all
   nations, and would in like manner speak in all tongues." Some confined
   the number of languages to the number of foreign nations and countries
   mentioned by Luke (Chrysostom), others extended it to 70 or 72
   (Augustine and Epiphanius), or 75, after the number of the sons of Noah
   (Gen. 10), or even to 120 (Pacianus), after the number of the disciples
   present. Baronius mentions these opinions in Annal. ad Ann. 34, vol. I.
   197. The feast of languages in the Roman Propaganda perpetuates this
   theory, but turns the moral miracle of spiritual enthusiasm into a
   mechanical miracle of acquired learning in unknown tongues. Were all
   the speakers to speak at once, as on the day of Pentecost, it would be
   a more than Babylonian confusion of tongues.

   Such a stupendous miracle as is here supposed might be justified by the
   far-reaching importance of that creative epoch, but it is without a
   parallel and surrounded by insuperable difficulties. The theory ignores
   the fact that the glossolalia began before the spectators arrived, that
   is, before there was any necessity of using foreign languages. It
   isolates the Pentecostal glossolalia and brings Luke into conflict with
   Paul and with himself; for in all other cases the gift of tongues
   appears, as already remarked, not as a missionary agency, but as an
   exercise of devotion. It implies that all the one hundred disciples
   present, including the women--for a tongue as of fire "sat upon each of
   them"--were called to be traveling evangelists. A miracle of that kind
   was superfluous (a Luxuswunder); for since the conquest of Alexander
   the Great the Greek language was so generally understood throughout the
   Roman empire that the apostles scarcely needed any other--unless it was
   Latin and their native Aramaean--for evangelistic purposes; and the
   Greek was used in fact by all the writers of the New Testament, even by
   James of Jerusalem, and in a way which shows that they had learnt it
   like other people, by early training and practice. Moreover there is no
   trace of such a miraculous knowledge, nor any such use of it after
   Pentecost. [281] On the contrary, we must infer that Paul did not
   understand the Lycaonian dialect (Acts 14:11-14), and we learn from
   early ecclesiastical tradition that Peter used Mark as an interpreter
   (hermeneus orhermeneutes, interpres, according to Papias, Irenaeus, and
   Tertullian). God does not supersede by miracle the learning of foreign
   languages and other kinds of knowledge which can be attained by the
   ordinary use of our mental faculties and opportunities.

   (f) It was a temporary speaking in foreign languages confined to the
   day of Pentecost and passing away with the flame-like tongues. The
   exception was justified by the object, namely, to attest the divine
   mission of the apostles and to foreshadow the universalness of the
   gospel. This view is taken by most modern commentators who accept the
   account of Luke, as Olshausen (who combines with it the theory b),
   Baumgarten, Thiersch, Rossteuscher, Lechler, Hackett, Gloag, Plumptre
   (in his Com. on Acts), and myself (in H. Ap. Ch.), and accords best
   with the plain sense of the narrative. But it likewise makes an
   essential distinction between the Pentecostal and the Corinthian
   glossolalia, which is extremely improbable. A temporary endowment with
   the knowledge of foreign languages unknown before is as great if not a
   greater miracle than a permanent endowment, and was just as superfluous
   at that time in Jerusalem as afterwards at Corinth; for the missionary
   sermon of Peter, which was in one language only, was intelligible to
   all.

   (g) The Pentecostal glossolalia was essentially the same as the
   Corinthian glossolalia, namely, an act of worship, and not of teaching;
   with only a slight difference in the medium of interpretation: it was
   at once internally interpreted and applied by the Holy Spirit himself
   to those hearers who believed and were converted, to each in his own
   vernacular dialect; while in Corinth the interpretation was made either
   by the speaker in tongues, or by one endowed with the gift of
   interpretation.

   I can find no authority for this theory, and therefore suggest it with
   modesty, but it seems to me to avoid most of the difficulties of the
   other theories, and it brings Luke into harmony with himself and with
   Paul. It is certain that the Holy Spirit moved the hearts of the
   hearers as well as the tongues of the speakers on that first day of the
   new creation in Christ. In a natural form the Pentecostal
   heteroglossolalia is continued in the preaching of the gospel in all
   tongues, and in more than three hundred translations of the Bible.

   II. False interpretations of the Pentecostal miracle.

   (1) The older rationalistic interpretation resolves the wind into a
   thunderstorm or a hurricane surcharged with electricity, the tongues of
   fire into flashes of lightning falling into the assembly, or electric
   sparks from a sultry atmosphere, and the glossolalia into a praying of
   each in his own vernacular, instead of the sacred old Hebrew, or
   assumes that some of the disciples knew several foreign dialects before
   and used them on the occasion. So Paulus, Thiess, Schulthess, Kuinöl,
   Schrader, Fritzsche, substantially also Renan, who dwells on the
   violence of Oriental thunderstorms, but explains the glossolalia
   differently according to analogous phenomena of later times. This view
   makes the wonder of the spectators and hearers at such an ordinary
   occurrence a miracle. It robs them of common sense, or charges
   dishonesty on the narrator. It is entirely inapplicable to the
   glossolalia in Corinth, which must certainly be admitted as an
   historical phenomenon of frequent occurrence in the apostolic church.
   It is contradicted by the comparative hosper andhoseiof the narrative,
   which distinguishes the sound from ordinary wind and the tongues of
   flame from ordinary fire; just as the words, "like a dove," to which
   all the Gospels compare the appearance of the Holy Spirit at Christ's
   baptism, indicate that no real dove is intended.

   (2) The modern rationalistic or mythical theory resolves the miracle
   into a subjective vision which was mistaken by the early Christians for
   an objective external fact. The glossolalia of Pentecost (not that in
   Corinth, which is acknowledged as historical) symbolizes the true idea
   of the universalness of the gospel and the Messianic unification of
   languages and nationalities (eis laos Kuriou kai glossa mia as the
   Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs expresses it). It is an imitation of
   the rabbinical fiction (found already in Philo) that the Sinaitic
   legislation was proclaimed through the bath-kol, the echo of the voice
   of God, to all nations in the seventy languages of the world. So Zeller
   (Contents and Origin of the Acts, I. 203-205), who thinks that the
   whole pentecostal fact, if it occurred at all. "must have been
   distorted beyond recognition in our record." But his chief argument is:
   "the impossibility and incredibility of miracles," which he declares
   (p. 175, note) to be "an axiom" of the historian; thus acknowledging
   the negative presupposition or philosophical prejudice which underlies
   his historical criticism. We hold, on the contrary, that the historian
   must accept the facts as he finds them, and if he cannot explain them
   satisfactorily from natural causes or subjective illusions, he must
   trace them to supernatural forces. Now the Christian church, which is
   certainly a most palpable and undeniable fact, must have originated in
   a certain place, at a certain time, and in a certain manner, and we can
   imagine no more appropriate and satisfactory account of its origin than
   that given by Luke. Baur and Zeller think it impossible that three
   thousand persons should have been converted in one day and in one
   place. They forget that the majority of the hearers were no skeptics,
   but believers in a supernatural revelation, and needed only to be
   convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah. Ewald says
   against Zeller, without naming him (VI. 119) "Nothing can be more
   perverse than to deny the historical truth of the event related in Acts
   2." We hold with Rothe (Vorlesungen über Kirchengeschichte I. 33) that
   the Pentecostal event was a real miracle ("ein eigentliches Wunder"),
   which the Holy Spirit wrought on the disciples and which endowed them
   with the power to perform miracles (according to the promise, Mark
   16:17, 18). Without these miraculous powers Christianity could not have
   taken hold on the world as it then stood. The Christian church itself,
   with its daily experiences of regeneration and conversion at home and
   in heathen lands, is the best living and omnipresent proof of its
   supernatural origin.

   III. Time and Place, of Pentecost. Did it occur on a Lord's Day (the
   eighth after Easter), or on a Jewish Sabbath? In a private house, or in
   the temple ? We decide for the Lord's Day, and for a private house. But
   opinions are much divided, and the arguments almost equally balanced.

   (1) The choice of the day in the week depends partly on the
   interpretation of "the morrow after the (Passover) Sabbath" from which
   the fiftieth day was to be counted, according to the legislative
   prescription in Lev. 23:11, 15, 16--namely, whether it was the morrow
   following the first day of the Passover, i.e. the 16th of Nisan, or the
   day after the regular Sabbath in the Passover week; partly on the date
   of Christ's crucifixion, which took place on a Friday, namely, whether
   this was the 14th or 15th of Nisan. If we assume that the Friday of
   Christ's death was the 14th of Nisan, then the 15th was a Sabbath, and
   Pentecost in that year fall on a Sunday; but if the Friday of the
   crucifixion was the 15th of Nisan (as I hold myself, see § 16, p. 133),
   then Pentecost fell on a Jewish Sabbath (so Wieseler, who fixes it on
   Saturday, May 27, a.d. 30), unless we count from the end of the 16th of
   Nisan (as Wordsworth and Plumptre do, who put Pentecost on a Sunday).
   But if we take the "Sabbath" in Lev. 23 in the usual sense of the
   weekly Sabbath (as the Sadducees and Karaites did), then the Jewish
   Pentecost fell always on a Sunday. At all events the Christian church
   has uniformly observed Whit-Sunday on the eighth Lord's Day after
   Easter, adhering in this case, as well as in the festivals of the
   resurrection (Sunday) and of the ascension (Thursday), to the old
   tradition as to the day of the week when the event occurred. This view
   would furnish an additional reason for the substitution of Sunday, as
   the day of the Lord's resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit,
   for the Jewish Sabbath. Wordsworth: "Thus the first day of the week has
   been consecrated to all the three Persons of the ever-blessed and
   undivided Trinity; and the blessings of Creation, Redemption, and
   Sanctification are commemorated on the Christian Sunday." Wieseler
   assumes, without good reason, that the ancient church deliberately
   changed the day from opposition to the Jewish Sabbath; but the
   celebration of Pentecost together with that of the Resurrection seems
   to be as old as the Christian church and has its precedent in the
   example of Paul, Acts 18:21; 20:16.--Lightfoot (Horae Hebr. in Acta Ap.
   2:1; Opera II. 692) counts Pentecost from the 16th of Nisan, but
   nevertheless puts the first Christian Pentecost on a Sunday by an
   unusual and questionable interpretation of Acts 2:1 en to
   sunplerousthai ten hemeran tes Pentekostes, which he makes to mean
   "when the day of Pentecost was fully gone," instead of "was fully
   come." But whether Pentecost fell on a Jewish Sabbath or on a Lord's
   Day, the coincidence in either case was significant.

   (2) As to the place, Luke calls it simply a "house" (oikos,Acts 2:2),
   which can hardly mean the temple (not mentioned till 2:46). It was
   probably the same "upper room" or chamber which he had mentioned in the
   preceding chapter, as the well known usual meeting place of the,
   disciples after the ascension, to huperoon...hou esan katamenontes,
   1:13). So Neander, Meyer, Ewald, Wordsworth, Plumptre, Farrar, and
   others. Perhaps it was the same chamber in which our Lord partook of
   the Paschal Supper with them (Mark 14:14, 15; Matt. 26:28). Tradition
   locates both events in the "Coenaculum," a room in an irregular
   building called "David's Tomb," which lies outside of Zion Gate some
   distance from Mt. Moriah. (See William M. Thomson, The Land and the
   Book, new ed. 1880, vol. I. p. 535 sq.). But Cyril of Jerusalem
   (Catech. XVI. 4) states that the apartment where the Holy Spirit
   descended was afterwards converted into a church. The uppermost room
   under the flat roof of Oriental houses. (huperoon, ?lyh) as often used
   as a place of devotion (comp. Acts 20:8). But as a private house could
   not possibly hold so great a multitude, we must suppose that Peter
   addressed the people in the street from the roof or from the outer
   staircase.

   Many of the older divines, as also Olshausen, Baumgarten, Wieseler,
   Lange, Thiersch (and myself in first ed. of Ap. Ch., p. 194), locate
   the Pentecostal scene in the temple, or rather in one of the thirty
   side buildings around it, which Josephus calls "houses" (oikous) in his
   description of Solomon's temple (Ant. VIII. 3, 2), or in Solomon's
   porch, which remained from the first temple, and where the disciples
   assembled afterwards (Acts 5:12, comp. 3:11). In favor of this view may
   be said, that it better agrees with the custom of the apostles (Luke
   24:53; Acts 2:46; 5:12, 42), with the time of the miracle (the morning
   hour of prayer), and with the assembling of a large multitude of at
   least three thousand hearers, and also that it seems to give additional
   solemnity to the event when it took place in the symbolical and typical
   sanctuary of the old dispensation. But it is difficult to conceive that
   the hostile Jews should have allowed the poor disciples to occupy one
   of those temple buildings and not interfered with the scene. In the
   dispensation of the Spirit which now began, the meanest dwelling, and
   the body of the humblest Christian becomes a temple of God. Comp. John
   4:24.

   IV. Effects of the Day of Pentecost. From Farrar's Life and Work of St.
   Paul (I. 93): "That this first Pentecost marked an eternal moment in
   the destiny of mankind, no reader of history will surely deny.
   Undoubtedly in every age since then the sons of God have, to an extent
   unknown before, been taught by the Spirit of God. Undoubtedly since
   then, to an extent unrealized before, we may know that the Spirit of
   Christ dwelleth in us. Undoubtedly we may enjoy a nearer sense of union
   with God in Christ than was accorded to the saints of the Old
   Dispensation, and a thankful certainty that we see the days which kings
   and prophets desired to see and did not see them, and hear the truths
   which they desired to hear and did not hear them. And this New
   Dispensation began henceforth in all its fulness. It was no exclusive
   consecration to a separated priesthood, no isolated endowment of a
   narrow apostolate. It was the consecration of a whole church--its men,
   its women, its children--to be all of them 'a chosen generation, a
   royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people;' it was an
   endowment, of which the full free offer was meant ultimately to be
   extended to all mankind. Each one of that hundred and twenty was not
   the exceptional recipient of a blessing and witness of a revelation,
   but the forerunner and representative of myriads more. And this miracle
   was not merely transient, but is continuously renewed. It is not a
   rushing sound and gleaming light, seen perhaps for a moment, but it is
   a living energy and an unceasing inspiration. It is not a visible
   symbol to a gathered handful of human souls in the upper room of a
   Jewish house, but a vivifying wind which shall henceforth breathe in
   all ages of the world's history; a tide of light which is rolling, and
   shall roll, from shore to shore until the earth is fall of the
   knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."

   [252] John 14:6, 26; 15:26; 16:7. The preparatory communication of the
   Spirit is related in John 20:22.

   [253] Comp. especially the classical chapters on the gifts of the
   Spirit, 1 Cor. 12, 13, and 14, and Rom. 12.

   [254] The Greek name he pentekoste (hemera) is used (like
   quinquagesima) as a substantive, Tob. 2:1; 2 Macc. 12:32; Acts 2:1;
   20:16; 1 Cor. 16:3, and by Josephus, Ant. III. 10, 6, etc. It survives
   not only in all the Romanic languages, but also in the German
   Pfingsten. The English Whit-Sunday is usually derived from the white
   garments of the candidates for baptism worn on that day (hence Dominica
   alba); others connect it with wit, the gift of wisdom from above. The
   Hebrew names of the festival are ry?qh gch, heorte therismou, the feast
   of harvest (Ex. 23:16), vyrvbkh vvy and hemera ton neon, day of the
   first fruits (Num. 28:26), tv?vsh gch, heorte hebdomadon, hagia hepta
   hebdomadon, festival of (seven) weeks, as the harvest continued for
   seven weeks (Deut. 16:9, 10; Lev. 23:15; Tob. 2:1). It began directly
   after the Passover with the offering of the first sheaf of the
   barley-harvest, and ended at Pentecost with the offering of the first
   two loaves from the wheat-harvest.

   [255] Josephus speaks of "many tens of thousands being gathered
   together about the temple" on Pentecost, Ant. xiv. 13, 4; comp. xvii.
   10, 2; Bell Jud. II. 3, 1. The Passover, of course, was more numerously
   attended by Jews from Palestine; but distant foreigners were often
   prevented by the dangers of travel in the early spring. Paul twice went
   to Jerusalem on Pentecost, Acts 18:21; 20:16. Many Passover pilgrims
   would naturally remain till the second festival.

   [256] Hence called the feast of the joy of the Law (hrvth tchmsh). The
   date of Sinaitic legislation is based on a comparison of Ex. 12:2 with
   19:1 (comp. my Hist. of the Ap. Ch., p. 192, note 5). The legislation
   on Pentecost, Deut. 16:9-12, represents it as a feast of rejoicing, and
   concludes with a reference to the bondage in Egypt and the commandments
   of Jehovah. Otherwise there is no allusion in the Bible, nor in Philo
   nor Josephus, to the historical significance of Pentecost. But there
   was a Jewish custom which Schöttgen (Hor. Heb. in Acts 2:1) traces to
   apostolic times, of spending the night before Pentecost in thanksgiving
   to God for the gift of the law. In the present Jewish observance the
   commemoration of the Sinaitic legislation is made prominent. Some Jews
   "adorn their houses with flowers and wear wreaths on their heads, with
   the declared purpose of testifying their joy in the possession of the
   Law."

   [257] The list of nations, Acts 2:8-11, gives a bird's eye view of the
   Roman empire from the East and North southward and westward as far as
   Rome, and then again eastward to Arabia. Cyprus and Greece are omitted.
   There were Christians in Damascus before the conversion of Paul (9:2),
   and a large congregation at Rome long before he wrote his Epistle (Rom.
   1:8).

   [258] Acts 1:15; 2:7. Ten times the number of tribes of Israel. These
   were, however, not all the disciples; Paul mentions five hundred
   brethren to whom the risen Lord appeared at once, 1 Cor. 15:6.

   [259] Exod. 19:16; comp. Hebr. 12:18, 19.

   [260] hechos hosper pheromenes pnoes biaias, ein Getöse wie von einem
   dahinfahrenden heftigen Wehen (Meyer). The term pheromene, borne on, is
   the same which Peter uses of the inspiration of the prophets, 2 Pet.
   1:21.

   [261] diamerizomenai glossai hosei puros, Acts2:3, are not parted or "
   cloven"tongues (E. V.)--resembling the fork-like shape of the episcopal
   mitre--but distributed tongues, spreading from one to another. This is
   the meaning of diamerizein, in ver. 45; Luke 22:17; 23:34; John 19:24;
   Matt. 27:35. The distributive idea explains the change of number in
   ver.3, glossai--ekathisen, i.e., one tongue sat on each disciple.

   [262] Hence hosper and hosei. John Lightfoot: "Sonus ventus vehementis,
   sed absque vento; sic etiam linguae igneae, sed absque igne."

   [263] Luke 3:22 (hos peristeran); Matt. 3:10 (hosei); Mark 1:10; John
   1:32. The Rabbinical comment on Gen. 1:2 makes the same comparison,
   that " the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters like a dove,"
   and Milton sings (Parad, Lost, i. 20): " With mighty wings outspread
   Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss."

   [264] They were baptized with water by John; but Christian baptism was
   first administered by them on the day of Pentecost. Christ himself did
   not baptize, John 4:2.

   linguarum dispersos in unum populum collegit." See note on Glossolalia
   (p.17).

   [280] The former is the usual view, the latter is maintained by
   Stanley, Plumptre, and Farrar. Paul addressed the excited multitude in
   Jerusalem in the Hebrew tongue, which commanded greater silence, Acts
   22:2. This implies that they would not have understood him in Greek as
   well, or listened as attentively.

   [281] What may be claimed for St. Bernard, St. Vincent Ferrer, and St.
   Francis Xavier is not a miraculous heteroglossolalia, but an eloquence
   so ardent, earnest, and intense, that the rude nations which they
   addressed in Latin or Spanish imagined they heard them in their mother
   tongue. St. Bernard (d. 1153) fired the Germans in Latin to the second
   crusade, and made a greater impression on them by his very appearance
   than the translation of the same speech by his interpreter. See
   Neander, Der heil. Bernhard, p. 338 (2d ed.). Alban Butler (Lives of
   the Saints, sub April 5) reports of St. Vincent Ferrer (died 1419)
   "Spondanus and many others say, the saint was honored with the gift of
   tongues, and that, preaching in his own, he was understood by men of
   different languages; which is also affirmed by Lanzano, who says, that
   Greeks, Germans, Sardes, Hungarians, and people of other nations,
   declared they understood every word he spoke, though he preached in
   Latin, or in his mother-tongue, as spoken at Valentia." This account
   clearly implies that Ferrer did not understand Greek, German, and
   Hungarian. As to Francis Xavier (d. 1552), Alban Butler says (sub Dec.
   3) that the gift of tongues was "a transient favor," and that he
   learned the Malabar tongue and the Japanese "by unwearied application;"
   from which we may infer that his impression upon the heathen was
   independent of the language, Not one of these saints claimed the gift
   of tongues or other miraculous powers, but only their disciples or
   later writers.

   at the expense of Paul; the, "Recognitions" are a Catholic recension
   and modification of the "Homilies." The pseudo-Clementine literature

   The congregation of Jerusalem became the mother church of Jewish
   Christianity, and thus of all Christendom. It grew both inwardly and
   outwardly under the personal direction of the apostles, chiefly of
   Peter, to whom the Lord had early assigned a peculiar prominence in the
   work of building his visible church on earth. The apostles were
   assisted by a number of presbyters, and seven deacons or persons
   appointed to care for the poor and the sick. But the Spirit moved in
   the whole congregation, bound to no particular office. The preaching of
   the gospel, the working of miracles in the name of Jesus, and the
   attractive power of a holy walk in faith and love, were the instruments
   of progress. The number of the Christians, or, as they at first called
   themselves, disciples, believers, brethren, saints, soon rose to five
   thousand. They continued steadfastly under the instruction and in the
   fellowship of the apostles, in the daily worship of God and celebration
   of the holy Supper with their agapae or love-feasts. They felt
   themselves to be one family of God, members of one body under one head,
   Jesus Christ; and this fraternal unity expressed itself even in a
   voluntary community of goods--an anticipation, as it were, of an ideal
   state at the end of history, but without binding force upon any other
   congregation. They adhered as closely to the temple worship and the
   Jewish observances as the new life admitted and as long as there was
   any hope of the conversion of Israel as a nation. They went daily to
   the temple to teach, as their Master had done, but held their
   devotional meetings in private houses. [282]

   The addresses of Peter to the people and the Sanhedrin [283] are
   remarkable for their natural simplicity and adaptation. They are full
   of fire and vigor, yet full of wisdom and persuasion, and always to the
   point. More practical and effective sermons were never preached. They
   are testimonies of an eye-witness so timid a few weeks before, and now
   so bold and ready at any moment to suffer and die for the cause. They
   are an expansion of his confession that Jesus is the Christ the Son of
   the living God, the Saviour. He preached no subtle theological
   doctrines, but a few great facts and truths: the crucifixion and
   resurrection of Jesus the Messiah, already known to his hearers for his
   mighty signs and wonders, his exaltation to the right hand of Almighty
   God, the descent and power of the Holy Spirit, the fulfilment of
   prophecy, the approaching judgment and glorious restitution of all
   things, the paramount importance of conversion and faith in Jesus as
   the only name whereby we can be saved. There breathes in them an air of
   serene joy and certain triumph.

   We can form no clear conception of this bridal season of the Christian
   church when no dust of earth soiled her shining garments, when she was
   wholly absorbed in the contemplation and love of her divine Lord, when
   he smiled down upon her from his throne in heaven, and added daily to
   the number of the saved. It was a continued Pentecost, it was paradise
   restored. "They did take their food with gladness and singleness of
   heart, praising God, and having favor with all the people." [284]

   Yet even in this primitive apostolic community inward corruption early
   appeared, and with it also the severity of discipline and
   self-purification, in the terrible sentence of Peter on the
   hypocritical Ananias and Sapphira.

   At first Christianity found favor with the people. Soon, however, it
   had to encounter the same persecution as its divine founder had
   undergone, but only, as before, to transform it into a blessing and a
   means of growth.

   The persecution was begun by the skeptical sect of the Sadducees, who
   took offence at the doctrine of the resurrection of Christ, the centre
   of all the apostolic preaching.

   When Stephen, one of the seven deacons of the church at Jerusalem, a
   man full of faith and zeal, the forerunner of the apostle Paul, boldly
   assailed the perverse and obstinate spirit of Judaism, and declared the
   approaching downfall of the Mosaic economy, the Pharisees made common
   cause with the Sadducees against the gospel. Thus began the
   emancipation of Christianity from the temple-worship of Judaism, with
   which it had till then remained at least outwardly connected. Stephen
   himself was falsely accused of blaspheming Moses, and after a
   remarkable address in his own defence, he was stoned by a mob (a.d.
   37), and thus became the worthy leader of the sacred host of martyrs,
   whose blood was thenceforth to fertilize the soil of the church. From
   the blood of his martyrdom soon sprang the great apostle of the
   Gentiles, now his bitterest persecutor, and an eye-witness of his
   heroism and of the glory of Christ in his dying face. [285]

   The stoning of Stephen was the signal for a general persecution, and
   thus at the same time for the spread of Christianity over all Palestine
   and the region around. And it was soon followed by the conversion of
   Cornelius of Caesarea, which opened the door for the mission to the
   Gentiles. In this important event Peter likewise was the prominent
   actor.

   After some seven years of repose the church at Jerusalem suffered a new
   persecution under king Herod Agrippa (a.d. 44). James the elder, the
   brother of John, was beheaded. Peter was imprisoned and condemned to
   the same fate; but he was miraculously liberated, and then forsook
   Jerusalem, leaving the church to the care of James the "brother of the
   Lord." Eusebius, Jerome, and the Roman Catholic historians assume that
   he went at that early period to Rome, at least on a temporary visit, if
   not for permanent residence. But the book of Acts (12:17) says only:
   "He departed, and went into another place." The indefiniteness of this
   expression, in connection with a remark of Paul. 1 Cor. 9:5, is best
   explained on the supposition that he had hereafter no settled home, but
   led the life of a travelling missionary like most of the apostles.

   The Later Labors of Peter.

   Afterwards we find Peter again in Jerusalem at the apostolic council
   (a.d. 50); [286] then at Antioch (51); where he came into temporary
   collision with Paul; [287] then upon missionary tours, accompanied by
   his wife (57); [288] perhaps among the dispersed Jews in Babylon or in
   Asia Minor, to whom he addressed his epistles. [289] Of a residence of
   Peter in Rome the New Testament contains no trace, unless, as the
   church fathers and many modern expositors think, Rome is intended by
   the mystic "Babylon" mentioned in 1 Pet. 5:13 (as in the Apocalypse),
   but others think of Babylon on the Euphrates, and still others of
   Babylon on the Nile (near the present Cairo, according to the Coptic
   tradition). The entire silence of the Acts of the Apostles 28,
   respecting Peter, as well as the silence of Paul in his epistle to the
   Romans, and the epistles written from Rome during his imprisonment
   there, in which Peter is not once named in the salutations, is decisive
   proof that he was absent from that city during most of the time between
   the years 58 and 63. A casual visit before 58 is possible, but
   extremely doubtful, in view of the fact that Paul labored independently
   and never built on the foundation of others; [290] hence he would
   probably not have written his epistle to the Romans at all, certainly
   not without some allusion to Peter if he had been in any proper sense
   the founder of the church of Rome. After the year 63 we have no data
   from the New Testament, as the Acts close with that year, and the
   interpretation of "Babylon" at the end of the first Epistle of Peter is
   doubtful, though probably meant for Rome. The martyrdom of Peter by
   crucifixion was predicted by our Lord, John 21:18, 19, but no place is
   mentioned.

   We conclude then that Peter's presence in Rome before 63 is made
   extremely doubtful, if not impossible, by the silence of Luke and Paul,
   when speaking of Rome and writing from Rome, and that His presence
   after 63 can neither be proved nor disproved from the New Testament,
   and must be decided by post-biblical testimonies.

   It is the uniform tradition of the eastern and western churches that
   Peter preached the gospel in Rome, and suffered martyrdom there in the
   Neronian persecution. So say more or less clearly, yet not without
   admixture of error, Clement of Rome (who mentions the martyrdom, but
   not the place), at the close of the first century; Ignatius of Antioch
   (indistinctly), Dionysius of Corinth, Irenaeus of Lyons, Caius of Rome,
   in the second century; Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Hippolytus,
   Tertullian, in the third; Lactantius, Eusebius, Jerome, and others, in
   the fourth. To these patristic testimonies may be added the apocryphal
   testimonies of the pseudo-Petrine and pseudo-Clementine fictions, which
   somehow connect Peter's name with the founding of the churches of
   Antioch, Alexandria, Corinth, and Rome. However these testimonies from
   various men and countries may differ in particular circumstances, they
   can only be accounted for on the supposition of some fact at the
   bottom; for they were previous to any use or abuse of this, tradition
   for heretical or for orthodox and hierarchical purposes. The chief
   error of the witnesses from Dionysius and Irenaeus onward is that Peter
   is associated with Paul as "founder" of the church of Rome; but this
   may be explained from the very probable fact that some of the
   "strangers from Rome" who witnessed the Pentecostal miracle and heard
   the sermon of Peter, as also some disciples who were scattered abroad
   by the persecution after the martyrdom of Stephen, carried the seed of
   the gospel to Rome, and that these converts of Peter became the real
   founders of the Jewish-Christian congregation in the metropolis. Thus
   the indirect agency of Peter was naturally changed into a direct agency
   by tradition which forgot the names of the pupils in the glorification
   of the teacher.

   The time of Peter's arrival in Rome, and the length of his residence
   there, cannot possibly be ascertained. The above mentioned silence of
   the Acts and of Paul's Epistles allows him only a short period of labor
   there, after 63. The Roman tradition of a twenty or twenty-five years'
   episcopate of Peter in Rome is unquestionably a colossal chronological
   mistake. [291] Nor can we fix the year of his martyrdom, except that it
   must have taken place after July, 64, when the Neronian persecution
   broke out (according to Tacitus). It is variously assigned to every
   year between 64 and 69. We shall return to it again below, and in
   connection with the martyrdom of Paul, with which it is associated in
   tradition. [292]

   his Kirchengesch. 1877, p. 34), Mayerhoff, De Wette, Greenwood (1856),
   Lipsius (1869), Volkmar (1873), Zeller (1876). Volkmar denies even the
   martyrdom of Paul, and fancies that he died quietly in a villa near
   Rome. Zeller (in Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift," for 1876, p. 46 sq.) was
   disposed to substitute "James" for the defective name "Peter" in the
   testimony of Clemens Rom., Ad Cor. c. 5, but this is now set aside by
   the edition of Bryennios from a more complete manuscript, which clearly
   reads Petros hos in full. On the other hand the presence and martyrdom
   of Peter in Rome is affirmed not only by all the Roman Catholic, but
   also by many eminent Protestant historians and critics, as Bleek,
   Credner, Olshausen, Gieseler, Neander, Niedner, Rothe, Thiersch,
   Krafft, Ewald, Plumptre, and even by Hilgenfeld, who justly remarks
   (Einleitung in das N. T. 1875 p. 624): "Man kann ein guter Protestant
   sein, wenn man den Märtyrertod des Petrus in Rom festhält." Renan (in
   an appendix to his L'Antechrist, 551 sqq.) likewise asserts that Peter
   came to Rome, though not before 63, and was among the victims of the
   Neronian persecution in 64, whom Tacitus describes as crucibus affixi.
   He understands "Babylon,"1 Pet. 5:13, of Rome, according to the secret
   style of the Christians of those days. In February, 1872, after the
   downfall of the temporal power of the papacy, a disputation was held in
   Rome between Protestant ministers (Gavazzi, Sciarelli, and Ribetto) and
   Roman divines (Guidi, and Canon Fabiani) on Peter's presence in that
   city; the former denying, the latter affirming it. The disputation was
   published in several languages, and although destitute of critical
   value, it derives a sort of historical significance from the place
   where it was held, within a short distance from the residence of Pius
   IX., the first infallible pope. See Racconto autentico della disputa,

   § 26. The Peter of History and the Peter of Fiction.

   No character in the New Testament is brought before us in such
   life-like colors, with all his virtues and faults, as that of Peter. He
   was frank and transparent, and always gave himself as he was, without
   any reserve.

   We may distinguish three stages in his development. In the Gospels, the
   human nature of Simon appears most prominent the Acts unfold the divine
   mission of Peter in the founding of the church, with a temporary
   relapse at Antioch (recorded by Paul); in his Epistles we see the
   complete triumph of divine grace. He was the strongest and the weakest
   of the Twelve. He had all the excellences and all the defects of a
   sanguine temperament. He was kind-hearted, quick, ardent, hopeful,
   impulsive, changeable, and apt to run from one extreme to another. He
   received from Christ the highest praise and the severest censure. He
   was the first to confess him as the Messiah of God, for which he
   received his new name of Peter, in prophetic anticipation of his
   commanding position in church history; but he was also the first to
   dissuade him from entering the path of the cross to the crown, for
   which he brought upon himself the rebuke, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
   The rock of the church had become a rock of offence and a
   stumbling-block. He protested, in presumptive modesty, when Christ
   would wash his feet; and then, suddenly changing his mind, he wished
   not his feet only, but his hands and head to be washed. He cut off the
   ear of Malchus in carnal zeal for his Master; and in a few minutes
   afterwards he forsook him and fled. He solemnly promised to be faithful
   to Christ, though all should forsake him; and yet in the same night he
   betrayed him thrice. He was the first to cast off the Jewish prejudices
   against the unclean heathen and to fraternize with the Gentile converts
   at Caesarea and at Antioch; and he was the first to withdraw from them
   in cowardly fear of the narrow-minded Judaizers from Jerusalem, for
   which inconsistency he had to submit to a humiliating rebuke of Paul.
   [293]

   But Peter was as quick in returning to his right position as in turning
   away from it. He most sincerely loved the Lord from the start and had
   no rest nor peace till he found forgiveness. With all his weakness he
   was a noble, generous soul, and of the greatest service in the church.
   God overruled his very sins and inconsistencies for his humiliation and
   spiritual progress. And in his Epistles we find the mature result of
   the work of purification, a spirit most humble, meek, gentle, tender,
   loving, and lovely. Almost every word and incident in the gospel
   history connected with Peter left its impress upon his Epistles in the
   way of humble or thankful reminiscence and allusion. His new name,
   "Rock," appears simply as a "stone" among other living stones in the
   temple of God, built upon Christ, "the chief corner-stone." [294] His
   charge to his fellow-presbyters is the same which Christ gave to him
   after the resurrection, that they should be faithful "shepherds of the
   flock" under Christ, the chief "shepherd and bishop of their souls."
   [295] The record of his denial of Christ is as prominent in all the
   four Gospels, as Paul's persecution of the church is in the Acts, and
   it is most prominent--as it would seem under his own direction--in the
   Gospel of his pupil and "interpreter" Mark, which alone mentions the
   two cock-crows, thus doubling the guilt of the denial, [296] and which
   records Christ's words of censure ("Satan"), but omits Christ's praise
   ("Rock"). [297] Peter made as little effort to conceal his great sin,
   as Paul. It served as a thorn in his flesh, and the remembrance kept
   him near the cross; while his recovery from the fall was a standing
   proof of the power and mercy of Christ and a perpetual call to
   gratitude. To the Christian Church the double story of Peter's denial
   and recovery has been ever since an unfailing source of warning and
   comfort. Having turned again to his Lord, who prayed for him that his
   personal faith fail not, he is still strengthening the brethren. [298]

   As to his official position in the church, Peter stood from the
   beginning at the head of the Jewish apostles, not in a partisan sense,
   but in a large-hearted spirit of moderation and comprehension. He never
   was a narrow, contracted, exclusive sectarian. After the vision at
   Joppa and the conversion of Cornelius he promptly changed his inherited
   view of the necessity of circumcision, and openly professed the change
   at Jerusalem, proclaiming the broad principle "that God is no respecter
   of persons, but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh
   righteousness is acceptable to him;" and "that Jews and Gentiles alike
   are saved only through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ." [299] He
   continued to be the head of the Jewish Christian church at large, and
   Paul himself represents him as the first among the three
   "pillar"-apostles of the circumcision [300] But he stood mediating
   between James, who represented the right wing of conservatism, and
   Paul, who commanded the left wing of the apostolic army. And this is
   precisely the position which Peter occupies in his Epistles, which
   reproduce to a great extent the teaching of both Paul and James, and
   have therefore the character of a doctrinal Irenicum; as the Acts are a
   historical Irenicum, without violation of truth or fact.

   The Peter of Fiction.

   No character of the Bible, we may say, no personage in all history, has
   been so much magnified, misrepresented and misused for doctrinal and
   hierarchical ends as the plain fisherman of Galilee who stands at the
   head of the apostolic college. Among the women of the Bible the Virgin
   Mary has undergone a similar transformation for purposes of devotion,
   and raised to the dignity of the queen of heaven. Peter as the Vicar of
   Christ, and Mary as the mother of Christ, have in this idealized shape
   become and are still the ruling powers in the polity and worship of the
   largest branch of Christendom.

   In both cases the work of fiction began among the Judaizing heretical
   sects of the second and third centuries, but was modified and carried
   forward by the Catholic, especially the Roman church, in the third and
   fourth centuries.

   1. The Peter of the Ebionite fiction. The historical basis is Peter's
   encounter with Simon Magus in Samaria, [301] Paul's rebuke of Peter at
   Antioch, [302] and the intense distrust and dislike of the Judaizing
   party to Paul. [303] These three undoubted facts, together with a
   singular confusion of Simon Magus with an old Sabine deity, Semo
   Sancus, in Rome, [304] furnished the material and prompted the motive
   to religious tendency--novels written about and after the middle of the
   second century by ingenious semi-Gnostic Ebionites, either anonymously
   or under the fictitious name of Clement of Rome, the reputed successor
   of Peter. [305] In these productions Simon Peter appears as the great
   apostle of truth in conflict with Simon Magus, the pseudo-apostle of
   falsehood, the father of all heresies, the Samaritan possessed by a
   demon; and Peter follows him step by step from Caesarea Stratonis to
   Tyre, Sidon, Berytus, Antioch, and Rome, and before the tribunal of
   Nero, disputing with him, and refuting his errors, until at last the
   impostor, in the daring act of mocking Christ's ascension to heaven,
   meets a miserable end.

   In the pseudo-Clementine Homilies the name of Simon represents among
   other heresies also the free gospel of Paul, who is assailed as a false
   apostle and hated rebel against the authority of the Mosaic law. The
   same charges which the Judaizers brought against Paul, are here brought
   by Peter against Simon Magus, especially the assertion that one may be
   saved by grace alone. His boasted vision of Christ by which he
   professed to have been converted, is traced to a deceptive vision of
   the devil. The very words of Paul against Peter at Antioch, that he was
   "self-condemned" (Gal. 2:11), are quoted as an accusation against God.
   In one word, Simon Magus is, in part at least, a malignant Judaizing
   caricature of the apostle of the Gentiles.

   2. The Peter of the Papacy. The orthodox version of the Peter-legend,
   as we find it partly in patristic notices of Irenaeus, Origen,
   Tertullian, and Eusebius, partly in apocryphal productions, [306]
   retains the general story of a conflict of Peter with Simon Magus in
   Antioch and Rome, but extracts from it its anti-Pauline poison,
   associates Paul at the end of his life with Peter as the joint, though
   secondary, founder of the Roman church, and honors both with the
   martyr's crown in the Neronian persecution on the same day (the 29th of
   June), and in the same year or a year apart, but in different
   localities and in a different manner. [307] Peter was crucified like
   his Master (though head-downwards [308] ), either on the hill of
   Janiculum (where the church S. Pietro in Montorio stands), or more
   probably on the Vatican hill (the scene of the Neronian circus and
   persecution); [309] Paul, being a Roman citizen, was beheaded on the
   Ostian way at the Three Fountains (Tre Fontane), outside of the city.
   They even walked together a part of the Appian way to the place of
   execution. Caius (or Gaius), a Roman presbyter at the close of the
   second century, pointed to their monuments or trophies [310] on the
   Vatican, and in the via Ostia. The solemn burial of the remains of
   Peter in the catacombs of San Sebastiano, and of Paul on the Via Ostia,
   took place June 29, 258, according to the Kalendarium of the Roman
   church from the time of Liberius. A hundred years later the remains of
   Peter were permanently transferred to the Basilica of St. Peter on the
   Vatican, those of St. Paul to the Basilica of St. Paul (San Paolo fuori
   le mura) outside of the Porta Ostiensis (now Porta San Paolo). [311]

   The tradition of a twenty-five years' episcopate in Rome (preceded by a
   seven years' episcopate in Antioch) cannot be traced beyond the fourth
   century (Jerome), and arose, as already remarked, from chronological
   miscalculations in connection with the questionable statement of Justin
   Martyr concerning the arrival of Simon Magus in Rome under the reign of
   Claudius (41-54). The "Catalogus Liberianus," the oldest list of popes
   (supposed to have been written before 366), extends the pontificate of
   Peter to 25 years, 1 month, 9 days, and puts his death on June 29, 65
   (during the consulate of Nerva and Vestinus), which would date his
   arrival in Rome back to a.d. 40. Eusebius, in his Greek Chronicle as
   far as it is preserved, does not fix the number of years, but says, in
   his Church History, that Peter came to Rome in the reign of Claudius to
   preach against the pestilential errors of Simon Magus. [312] The
   Armenian translation of his Chronicle mentions "twenty" years; [313]
   Jerome, in his translation or paraphrase rather, "twenty-five" years,
   assuming, without warrant, that Peter left Jerusalem for Antioch and
   Rome in the second year of Claudius (42; but Acts 12:17 would rather
   point to the year 44), and died in the fourteenth or last year of Nero
   (68). [314] Among modern Roman Catholic historians there is no
   agreement as to the year of Peter's martyrdom: Baronius puts it in 69;
   [315] Pagi and Alban Butler in 65; Möhler, Gams, and Alzog indefinitely
   between 66 and 68. In all these cases it must be assumed that the
   Neronian persecution was continued or renewed after 64, of which we
   have no historical evidence. It must also be assumed that Peter was
   conspicuously absent from his flock during most of the time, to
   superintend the churches in Asia Minor and in Syria, to preside at the
   Council of Jerusalem, to meet with Paul in Antioch, to travel about
   with his wife, and that he made very little impression there till 58,
   and even till 63, when Paul, writing to and from Rome, still entirely
   ignores him. Thus a chronological error is made to overrule stubborn
   facts. The famous saying that "no pope shall see the (twenty-five)
   years of Peter," which had hitherto almost the force of law, has been
   falsified by the thirty-two years' reign of the first infallible pope)
   Pius IX., who ruled from 1846 to 1878.

   Note. -- On the Claims of the Papacy.

   On this tradition and on the indisputable preëminence of Peter in the
   Gospels and the Acts, especially the words of Christ to him after the
   great confession (Matt. 16:18), is built the colossal fabric of the
   papacy with all its amazing pretensions to be the legitimate succession
   of a permanent primacy of honor and supremacy of jurisdiction in the
   church of Christ, and--since 1870--with the additional claim of papal
   infallibility in all official utterances, doctrinal or moral. The
   validity of this claim requires three premises:

   1. The presence of Peter in Rome. This may be admitted as an historical
   fact, and I for my part cannot believe it possible that such a
   rock-firm and world-wide structure as the papacy could rest on the sand
   of mere fraud and error. It is the underlying fact which gives to
   fiction its vitality, and error is dangerous in proportion to the
   amount of truth which it embodies. But the fact of Peter's presence in
   Rome, whether of one year or twenty-five, cannot be of such fundamental
   importance as the papacy assumes it to be: otherwise we would certainly
   have some allusion to it in the New Testament. Moreover, if Peter was
   in Rome, so was Paul, and shared with him on equal terms the apostolic
   supervision of the Roman congregation, as is very evident from his
   Epistle to the Romans.

   2. The transferability of Peter's preëminence on a successor. This is
   derived by inference from the words of Christ: "Thou art Rock, and on
   this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not
   prevail against it." [316] This passage, recorded only by Matthew, is
   the exegetical rock of Romanism, and more frequently quoted by popes
   and papists than any other passage of the Scriptures. But admitting the
   obvious reference of petra to Peter, the significance of this prophetic
   name evidently refers to the peculiar mission of Peter in laying the
   foundation of the church once and for all time to come. He fulfilled it
   on the day of Pentecost and in the conversion of Cornelius; and in this
   pioneer work Peter can have no successor any more than St. Paul in the
   conversion of the Gentiles, and John in the consolidation of the two
   branches of the apostolic church.

   3. The actual transfer of this prerogative of Peter--not upon the
   bishops of Jerusalem, or Antioch, where he undoubtedly resided--but
   upon the bishop of Rome, where he cannot be proven to have been from
   the New Testament. Of such a transfer history knows absolutely nothing.
   Clement, bishop of Rome, who first, about a.d. 95, makes mention of
   Peter's martyrdom, and Ignatius of Antioch, who a few years later
   alludes to Peter and Paul as exhorting the Romans, have not a word to
   say about the transfer. The very chronology and succession of the first
   popes is uncertain.

   If the claims of the papacy cannot be proven from what we know of the
   historical Peter, there are, on the other hand, several undoubted facts
   in the real history of Peter which bear heavily upon those claims,
   namely:

   1. That Peter was married, Matt. 8:14, took his wife with him on his
   missionary tours, 1 Cor. 9:5, and, according to a possible
   interpretation of the "coëlect" (sister), mentions her in 1 Pet. 5:13.
   Patristic tradition ascribes to him children, or at least a daughter
   (Petronilla). His wife is said to have suffered martyrdom in Rome
   before him. What right have the popes, in view of this example, to
   forbid clerical marriage? We pass by the equally striking contrast
   between the poverty of Peter, who had no silver nor gold (Acts 3:6) and
   the gorgeous display of the triple-crowned papacy in the middle ages
   and down to the recent collapse of the temporal power.

   2. That in the Council at Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-11), Peter appears
   simply as the first speaker and debater, not as president and judge
   (James presided), and assumes no special prerogative, least of all an
   infallibility of judgment. According to the Vatican theory the whole
   question of circumcision ought to have been submitted to Peter rather
   than to a Council, and the decision ought to have gone out from him
   rather than from "the apostles and elders, brethren" (or "the elder
   brethren," 15:23).

   3. That Peter was openly rebuked for inconsistency by a younger apostle
   at Antioch (Gal. 2:11-14). Peter's conduct on that occasion is
   irreconcilable with his infallibility as to discipline; Paul's conduct
   is irreconcilable with Peter's alleged supremacy; and the whole scene,
   though perfectly plain, is so inconvenient to Roman and Romanizing
   views, that it has been variously distorted by patristic and Jesuit
   commentators, even into a theatrical farce gotten up by the apostles
   for the more effectual refutation of the Judaizers!

   4. That, while the greatest of popes, from Leo I. down to Leo XIII.
   never cease to speak of their authority over all the bishops and all
   the churches, Peter, in his speeches in the Acts, never does so. And
   his Epistles, far from assuming any superiority over his
   "fellow-elders" and over "the clergy" (by which he means the Christian
   people), breathe the spirit of the sincerest humility and contain a
   prophetic warning against the besetting sins of the papacy, filthy
   avarice and lordly ambition (1 Pet. 5:1-3). Love of money and love of
   power are twin-sisters, and either of them is "a root of all evil."

   It is certainly very significant that the weaknesses even more than the
   virtues of the natural Peter--his boldness and presumption, his dread
   of the cross, his love for secular glory, his carnal zeal, his use of
   the sword, his sleepiness in Gethsemane--are faithfully reproduced in
   the history of the papacy; while the addresses and epistles of the
   converted and inspired Peter contain the most emphatic protest against
   the hierarchical pretensions and worldly vices of the papacy, and
   enjoin truly evangelical principles--the general priesthood and royalty
   of believers, apostolic poverty before the rich temple, obedience to
   God rather than man, yet with proper regard for the civil authorities,
   honorable marriage, condemnation of mental reservation in Ananias and
   Sapphira, and of simony in Simon Magus, liberal appreciation of heathen
   piety in Cornelius, opposition to the yoke of legal bondage, salvation
   in no other name but that of Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [293] The old legend of Peter's flight from the Mamertine prison in
   Rome, which seems to antedate the hierarchical glorification of Peter,
   would prove that his "consistent inconsistency" overtook him once more
   at the close of his life. A few days before his execution, it is said,
   he bribed the jailor and escaped from prison, but when he reached a
   spot outside the Porta San Sebastiano, now marked by a chapel, the Lord
   appeared to him with a cross, and Peter asked in surprise: "Lord,
   whither goest thou (Domine quo vadis)?"Jesus replied: "I go to Rome to
   be crucified again (venio Romam iterum crucifigi)." The disciple
   returned deeply humbled, and delivered himself to the jailor to be
   crucified head-downwards. The footprint of the Lord is still shown (or
   was shown in 1841, when I saw it) in the little chapel called "Domine
   quo vadis," and a rude fresco on the wall represents the encounter. The
   legend is first alluded to by Origen (quoting from the Praxeis Paulou
   orPetrou, the words of the Saviour: Anothen mello staurothenai, see
   Opera IV. 332, and Hilgenfeld, l.c. IV. 72), then fully told in the
   apocryphal Acts of Peter and Paul, c. 82 (Tischendorf, l.c. p. 36,
   where Peter asks, Kurie, pou poreue; and the Lord answers: en Rome
   aperchomai staurothenai), and by Ambrose in Sermo de basilicis non
   tradendis haereticis contra Auxentium (quoted by Lipsius, Petrus-Sage,
   p. 134 sq.).

   [294] 1 Pet. 2:4-8. A striking instance of the impression of Christ's
   word without a trace of boastfulness and assumption of authority.

   [295] 1 Pet. 5:2; 2:25; comp. John 21:15-17.

   [296] Mark 14:72. "And straightway the second time the cock crew. And
   Peter called to mind the word how that Jesus said unto him, Before the
   cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice (comp.14:30); and when he
   thought thereon he wept."

   [297] Comp. Mark 8:27-33 with Matt. 16:13-23. The omission of the
   famous passage, "Thou art Rock," etc., can only be satisfactorily
   explained from the humility of Peter. An enemy or rival might have
   omitted them, but Mark was his faithful pupil, and would have mentioned
   them had he followed his own impulse, or had he been a papist.

   [298] Luke 22:31, 32, spoken in view of the approaching denial. This is
   the proper meaning of the passage which has been distorted by the
   Vatican Council into an argument for papal infallibility. Such
   application would logically imply also that every pope must deny
   Christ, and be converted in order to strengthen the brethren.

   [299] Acts 10:34, 35; 15:11.

   [300] Gal. 2:8, 9; comp. 1:18; 1 Cor. 15:5.

   [301] Acts 8:9-24. It is quite probable that in the description of the
   heretics in his second Epistle, Peter had in mind Simon Magus. Plumptre
   (l.c. p. 44) sees in the "great swelling words of vanity,"2 Pet. 2:18,
   an allusion to Simon's boast that he was "the Great Power of God" (Acts
   8:9, 10), and in the words "having eyes full of an adulteress,"etc. 2
   Pet. 2:12-14, an allusion to Helena, the mistress of Simon, who is said
   to have accompanied him.

   [302] Gal. 2:11-14.

   [303] This is clear from the Epistles of Paul, especially the Galatians
   and Corinthians, and from Acts 21.

   [304] Justin Martyr (Apol. l.c. 26 and 56) reports that Simon Magus
   went to Rome under Claudius and received divine honors there, as was
   shown by a statue erected to him on an island in the Tiber. Such a
   statue was actually discovered in 1574, but with the inscription Semoni
   Sanco Deo Fidio sacrum, [not Simoni Deo sancto]. With reference to this
   supposed worship, Simon boasts in the pseudo-Clementine Recogn. II. 9:
   "Adorabor ut deus, publicis divins donabor honoribus, ita ut simulacrum
   mihi statuentes tanquam deum colant et adarent."

   [305] The chief of these productions are the twenty Greek
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies, which are based upon the older Kerugma
   Petrou and other Jewish-Christian documents. See the ed. of Dressel:
   Clementis Romani quae feruntur Homilae viginti nunc prinum integrae,
   Gött. 1853 (429 pages), and of De Lagarde, Clementina, 1865. The
   Clementine literature has been thoroughly investigated by Baur,
   Hilgenfeld, Ritschl, Schliemann, Uhlhorn, Volkmar, and Lipsius. See a
   brief résumé in Baur's Kirchengesch. vol. I. 85-94. Baur first tried to
   prove the identity of Simon Magus with Paul, in his essay on the
   Christuspartei in der Korinthischen Gemeinde, Tübingen, 1831. But Simon
   is a more comprehensive representative of all anti-Jewish and Gnostic
   heresies, especially that of Marcion. If he were meant to represent
   Paul alone, the author would not have retained the historic features
   from Acts 8, which are entirely irreconcilable with Paul's well known
   history.

   [306] Such as the lost Kerugma Petrou en Rhome, and the Praedicatio
   Pauli (probably one book), used by Clement of Alexandria; the Syriac
   Sermon of Peter in Rome (in Curston's "Ancient Syriac Doc.," Lond.
   1864); the Acta Pauli, used by Origen and Eusebius; the Acts of Peter
   and Paul, of a later date, published by Thilo and Tischendorf. The last
   book has a conciliatory tendency, like the canonical Acts. Comp.
   Lipsius, l.c. pp. 47 sqq., and the fragments collected by Hilgenfeld,
   l.c. IV. 52 sqq.

   [307] The month is given in the Acta Petri et Pauli at the close:
   Eteleiothesan hoi hagioi endoxoi apostoloi Petros kai Paulos meni
   Iounio. kth. But different MSS. give July second or eighth. See
   Tischendorf, l. c. p. 39. According to Prudentius (Hymn. 12) the two
   apostles suffered on the same day, but a year apart: "Unus utrumque
   dies, pleno tamen innovatus anno, Vidit superba morte laureatum."

   [308] A bishop of the Vatican Council used this as an argument for
   papal absolutism and infallibility, inasmuch as Peter's head supported
   his body, and not the body the head!

   [309] Baronius, Ad Ann. 69 (in Theiner's ed. vol. I. 594 sq.)
   reconciles this difference by making the Janiculum and the Vatican one
   hill extending to the Milvian bridge.

   Next to Peter, who was the oecumenical leader of Jewish Christianity,
   stands James, the brother, of the Lord (also called by post-apostolic
   writers "James the Just," and "Bishop of Jerusalem"), as the local head
   of the oldest church and the leader of the most conservative portion of
   Jewish Christianity. He seems to have taken the place of James the son
   of Zebedee, after his martyrdom, a.d. 44. He became, with Peter and
   John, one of the three "pillars" of the church of the circumcision. And
   after the departure of Peter from Jerusalem James presided over the
   mother church of Christendom until his death. Though not one of the
   Twelve, he enjoyed, owing to his relationship to our Lord and his
   commanding piety, almost apostolic authority, especially in Judaea and
   among the Jewish converts. [317] On one occasion even Peter yielded to
   his influence or that of his representatives, and was misled into his
   uncharitable conduct towards the Gentile brethren. [318]

   James was not a believer before the resurrection of our Lord. He was
   the oldest of the four "brethren" (James, Joseph, Judas, Simon), of
   whom John reports with touching sadness: "Even his brethren did not
   believe in him." [319] It was one of the early and constant trials of
   our Lord in the days of his nomination that he was without honor among
   his fellow-townsmen, yea, "among his own kin, and in his own house."
   [320] James was no doubt imbued with the temporal and carnal Messianic
   misconceptions of the Jews, and impatient at the delay and
   unworldliness of his divine brother. Hence the taunting and almost
   disrespectful language: "Depart hence and go into Judaea .... If thou
   doest these things, manifest thyself to the world." The crucifixion
   could only deepen his doubt and sadness.

   But a special personal appearance of the risen Lord brought about his
   conversion, as also that of his brothers, who after the resurrection
   appear in the company of the apostles. [321] This turning-point in his
   life is briefly but significantly alluded to by Paul, who himself was
   converted by a personal appearance of Christ. [322] It is more fully
   reported in an interesting fragment of the, "Gospel according to the
   Hebrews" (one of the oldest and least fabulous of the apocryphal
   Gospels), which shows the sincerity and earnestness of James even
   before his conversion. [323] He had sworn, we are here told, "that he
   would not eat bread from that hour wherein the Lord had drunk the cup
   [of his passion] [324] until he should see him rising from the dead."
   The Lord appeared to him and communed with him, giving bread to James
   the Just and saying: "My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is
   risen from them that sleep."

   In the Acts and in the Epistle to the Galatians, James appears as the
   most conservative of the Jewish converts, at the head of the extreme
   right wing; yet recognizing Paul as the apostle of the Gentiles, giving
   him the right hand of fellowship, as Paul himself reports, and
   unwilling to impose upon the Gentile Christians the yoke of
   circumcision. He must therefore not be identified with the heretical
   Judaizers (the forerunners of the Ebionites), who hated and opposed
   Paul, and made circumcision a condition of justification and church
   membership. He presided at the Council of Jerusalem and proposed the
   compromise which saved a split in the church. He probably prepared the
   synodical letter which agrees with his style and has the same greeting
   formula peculiar to him. [325]

   He was an honest, conscientious, eminently practical, conciliatory
   Jewish Christian saint, the right man in the right place and at the
   right time, although contracted in his mental vision as in his local
   sphere of labor.

   From an incidental remark of Paul we may infer that James, like Peter
   and the other brothers of the Lord, was married. [326]

   The mission of James was evidently to stand in the breach between the
   synagogue and the church, and to lead the disciples of Moses gently to
   Christ. He was the only man that could do it in that critical time of
   the approaching judgment of the holy city. As long as there was any
   hope of a conversion of the Jews as a nation, he prayed for it and made
   the transition as easy as possible. When that hope vanished his mission
   was fulfilled.

   According to Josephus he was, at the instigation of the younger Ananus,
   the high priest, of the sect of the Sadducees, whom he calls "the most
   unmerciful of all the Jews in the execution of judgment," stoned to
   death with some others, as "breakers of the law," i.e. Christians, in
   the interval between the procuratorship of Festus and that of Albinus,
   that is, in the year 63. The Jewish historian adds that this act of
   injustice created great indignation among those most devoted to the law
   (the Pharisees), and that they induced Albinus and King Agrippa to
   depose Ananus (a son of the Annas mentioned in Luke 3:2; John 18:13).
   He thus furnishes an impartial testimony to the high standing of James
   even among the Jews. [327]

   Hegesippus, a Jewish Christian historian about a.d. 170, puts the
   martyrdom a few years later, shortly before the destruction of
   Jerusalem (69). [328] He relates that James was first thrown down from
   the pinnacle of the temple by the Jews and then stoned to death. His
   last prayer was an echo of that of his brother and Lord on the cross:
   "God, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."

   The dramatic account of James by Hegesippus [329] is an overdrawn
   picture from the middle of the second century, colored by Judaizing
   traits which may have been derived from the "Ascents of James" and
   other apocryphal sources. He turns James into a Jewish priest and
   Nazirite saint (comp. his advice to Paul, Acts 21:23, 24), who drank no
   wine, ate no flesh, never shaved, nor took a bath, and wore only linen.
   But the biblical James is Pharisaic and legalistic rather than Essenic
   and ascetic. In the pseudo-Clementine writings, he is raised even above
   Peter as the head of the holy church of the Hebrews, as "the lord and
   bishop of bishops," as "the prince of priests." According to tradition,
   mentioned by Epiphanius. James, like St. John at Ephesus, wore the
   high-priestly petalon, or golden plate on the forehead, with the
   inscription: "Holiness to the Lord" (Ex. 28:36). And in the Liturgy of
   St. James, the brother of Jesus is raised to the dignity of "the
   brother of the very God" (adelphotheos). Legends gather around the
   memory of great men, and reveal the deep impression they made upon
   their friends and followers. The character which shines through these
   James-legends is that of a loyal, zealous, devout, consistent Hebrew
   Christian, who by his personal purity and holiness secured the
   reverence and affection of all around him.

   But we must carefully distinguish between the Jewish-Christian, yet
   orthodox, overestimate of James in the Eastern church, as we find it in
   the fragments of Hegesippus and in the Liturgy of St. James, and the
   heretical perversion of James into an enemy of Paul and the gospel of
   freedom, as he appears in apocryphal fictions. We have here the same
   phenomenon as in the case of Peter and Paul. Every leading apostle has
   his apocryphal shadow and caricature both in the primitive church and
   in the modern critical reconstruction of its history. The name and
   authority of James was abused by the Judaizing party in undermining the
   work of Paul, notwithstanding the fraternal agreement of the two at
   Jerusalem. [330] The Ebionites in the second century continued this
   malignant assault upon the memory of Paul under cover of the honored
   names of James and Peter; while a certain class of modern critics
   (though usually from the opposite ultra- or pseudo-Pauline point of
   view) endeavor to prove the same antagonism from the Epistle of James
   (as far as they admit it to be genuine at all). [331]

   The Epistle in our canon, which purports to be written by "James, a
   bond-servant of God and of Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes of the
   dispersion," though not generally acknowledged at the time of Eusebius
   and Jerome, has strong internal evidence of genuineness. It precisely
   suits the character and position of the historical James as we know him
   from Paul and the Acts, and differs widely from the apocryphal James of
   the Ebionite fictions. [332] It hails undoubtedly from Jerusalem, the
   theocratic metropolis, amid the scenery of Palestine. The Christian
   communities appear not as churches, but as synagogues, consisting
   mostly of poor people, oppressed and persecuted by the rich and
   powerful Jews. There is no trace of Gentile Christians or of any
   controversy between them and the Jewish Christians. The Epistle was
   perhaps a companion to the original Gospel of Matthew for the Hebrews,
   as the first Epistle of John was such a companion to his Gospel. It is
   probably the oldest of the epistles of the New Testament. [333] It
   represents, at all events, the earliest and meagerest, yet an eminently
   practical and necessary type of Christianity, with prophetic
   earnestness, proverbial sententiousness, great freshness, and in fine
   Greek. It is not dogmatic but ethical. It has a strong resemblance to
   the addresses of John the Baptist and the Lord's Sermon on the Mount,
   and also to the book of Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon. [334]
   It never attacks the Jews directly, but still less St. Paul, at least
   not his genuine doctrine. It characteristically calls the gospel the
   "perfect law of liberty," [335] thus connecting it very closely with
   the Mosaic dispensation, yet raising it by implication far above the
   imperfect law of bondage. The author has very little to say about
   Christ and the deeper mysteries of redemption, but evidently
   presupposes a knowledge of the gospel history, and reverently calls
   Christ "the Lord of glory," and himself humbly his "bond-servant."
   [336] He represents religion throughout in its practical aspect as an
   exhibition of faith by good works. He undoubtedly differs widely from
   Paul, yet does not contradict, but supplements him, and fills an
   important place in the Christian system of truth which comprehends all
   types of genuine piety. There are multitudes of sincere, earnest, and
   faithful Christian workers who never rise above the level of James to
   the sublime heights of Paul or John. The Christian church would never
   have given to the Epistle of James a place in the canon if she had felt
   that it was irreconcilable with the doctrine of Paul. Even the Lutheran
   church did not follow her great leader in his unfavorable judgment, but
   still retains James among the canonical books.

   After the martyrdom of James he was succeeded by Symeon, a son of
   Clopas and a cousin of Jesus (and of James). He continued to guide the
   church at Jerusalem till the reign of Trajan, when he died a martyr at
   the great age of a hundred and twenty years. [337] The next thirteen
   bishops of Jerusalem, who came, however, in rapid succession, were
   likewise of Jewish descent.

   Throughout this period the church of Jerusalem preserved its strongly
   Israelitish type, but joined with it "the genuine knowledge of Christ,"
   and stood in communion with the Catholic church, from which the
   Ebionites, as heretical Jewish Christians, were excluded. After the
   line of the fifteen circumcised bishops had run out, and Jerusalem was
   a second time laid waste under Hadrian, the mass of the Jewish
   Christians gradually merged in the orthodox Greek Church.

   Notes

   I. James and the Brothers of the Lord. - There are three, perhaps four,
   eminent persons in the New Testament bearing the name of James
   (abridged from Jacob, which from patriarchal memories was a more common
   name among the Jews than any other except Symeon or Simon, and Joseph
   or Joses):

   1. James (the son) of Zebedee, the brother of John and one of the three
   favorite apostles, the proto-martyr among the Twelve (beheaded a.d. 44,
   see Acts 12:2), as his brother John was the survivor of all the
   apostles. They were called the "sons of thunder."

   2. James (the son) of Alphaeus, who was likewise one of the Twelve, and
   is mentioned in the four apostle-catalogues, Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:10;
   Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13.

   3. James the Little, Mark 15:40 (ho mikros, not, "the Less," as in the
   E. V.), probably so called from his small stature (as Zacchaeus, Luke
   19:3), the son of a certain Mary and brother of Joseph, Matt. 27:56
   (Maria he tou Iakobou kai Ioseph meter ); Mark 15:40, 47; 16:1; Luke
   24:10. He is usually identified with James the son of Alphaeus, on the
   assumption that his mother Mary was the wife of Clopas, mentioned John
   19:25, and that Clopas was the same person as Alphaeus. But this
   identification is at least very problematical.

   4. James, simply so called, as the most distinguished after the early
   death of James the Elder, or with the honorable epithet Brother of the
   Lord (ho adelphos tou Kuriou), and among post-apostolic writers, the
   Just, also Bishop of Jerusalem. The title connects him at once with the
   four brothers and the unnamed sisters of our Lord, who are repeatedly
   mentioned in the Gospels, and he as the first among them. Hence the
   complicated question of the nature of this relationship. Although I
   have fully discussed this intricate subject nearly forty years ago
   (1842) in the German essay above mentioned, and then again in my
   annotations to Lange on Matthew (Am. ed. 1864, pp. 256-260), I will
   briefly sum up once more the chief points with reference to the most
   recent discussions (of Lightfoot and Renan).

   There are three theories on James and the brothers of Jesus. I would
   call them the brother-theory, the half-brother-theory, and the
   cousin-theory. Bishop Lightfoot (and Canon Farrar) calls them after
   their chief advocates, the Helvidian (an invidious designation), the
   Epiphanian, and the Hieronymian theories. The first is now confined to
   Protestants, the second is the Greek, the third the Roman view.

   (1) The brother-theory takes the term adelphoithe usual sense, and
   regards the brothers as younger children of Joseph and Mary,
   consequently as full brothers of Jesus in the eyes of the law and the
   opinion of the people, though really only half-brothers, in view of his
   supernatural conception. This is exegetically the most natural view and
   favored by the meaning of adelphos(especially when used as a standing
   designation), the constant companionship of these brethren with Mary
   (John 2:12; Matt. 12:46; 13:55), and by the obvious meaning of Matt.
   1:25 (ouk eginosken auten heos ohu,comp. 1:18 prin e sunelthein autous)
   and Luke 2:7 (prototokos), as explained from the standpoint of the
   evangelists, who used these terms in full view of the subsequent
   history of Mary and Jesus. The only serious objection to it is of a
   doctrinal and ethical nature, viz., the assumed perpetual virginity of
   the mother of our Lord and Saviour, and the committal of her at the
   cross to John rather than her own sons and daughters (John 19:25). If
   it were not for these two obstacles the brother-theory would probably
   be adopted by every fair and honest exegete. The first of these
   objections dates from the post-apostolic ascetic overestimate of
   virginity, and cannot have been felt by Matthew and Luke, else they
   would have avoided those ambiguous terms just noticed. The second
   difficulty presses also on the other two theories, only in a less
   degree. It must therefore be solved on other grounds, namely, the
   profound spiritual sympathy and congeniality of John with Jesus and
   Mary, which rose above carnal relationships, the probable cousinship of
   John (based upon the proper interpretation of the same passage, John
   19:25), and the unbelief of the real brethren at the time of the
   committal.

   This theory was held by Tertullian (whom Jerome summarily disposes of
   as not being a, "homo ecclesiae," i.e. a schismatic), defended by
   Helvidius at Rome about 380 (violently attacked as a heretic by
   Jerome), and by several individuals and sects opposed to the incipient
   worship of the Virgin Mary; and recently by the majority of German
   Protestant exegetes since Herder, such as Stier, De Wette, Meyer,
   Weiss, Ewald, Wieseler, Keim, also by Dean Alford, and Canon Farrar
   (Life of Christ, I. 97 sq.). I advocated the same theory in my German
   tract, but admitted afterwards in my Hist. of Ap. Ch., p. 378, that I
   did not give sufficient weight to the second theory.

   (2) The half-brother-theory regards the brethren and sisters of Jesus
   as children of Joseph by a former wife, consequently as no
   blood-relations at all, but so designated simply as Joseph was called
   the father of Jesus, by an exceptional use of the term adapted to the
   exceptional fact of the miraculous incarnation. This has the dogmatic
   advantage of saving the perpetual virginity of the mother of our Lord
   and Saviour; it lessens the moral difficulty implied in John 19:25; and
   it has a strong traditional support in the apocryphal Gospels and in
   the Eastern church. It also would seem to explain more easily the
   patronizing tone in which the brethren speak to our Lord in John 7:3,
   4. But it does not so naturally account for the constant companionship
   of these brethren with Mary; it assumes a former marriage of Joseph
   nowhere alluded to in the Gospels, and makes Joseph an old man and
   protector rather than husband of Mary; and finally it is not free from
   suspicion of an ascetic bias, as being the first step towards the dogma
   of the perpetual virginity. To these objections may be added, with
   Farrar, that if the brethren had been elder sons of Joseph, Jesus would
   not have been regarded as legal heir of the throne of David (Matt.
   1:16; Luke 1:27; Rom. 1:3; 2 Tim. 2:8; Rev. 22:16).

   This theory is found first in the apocryphal writings of James (the
   Protevangelium Jacobi, the Ascents of James, etc.), and then among the
   leading Greek fathers (Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, Gregory
   of Nyssa, Epiphanius, Cyril of Alexandria); it is embodied in the
   Greek, Syrian, and Coptic services, which assign different dates to the
   commemoration of James the son of Alphaeus (Oct. 9), and of James the
   Lord's brother (Oct. 23). It may therefore be called the theory of the
   Eastern church. It was also held by some Latin fathers before Jerome
   (Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose), and has recently been ably advocated
   by Bishop Lightfoot (l.c.), followed by Dr. Plumptre (in the
   introduction to his Com. on the Ep. of James).

   (3) The cousin-theory regards the brethren as more distant relatives,
   namely, as children of Mary, the wife of Alphaeus and sister of the
   Virgin Mary, and identifies James, the brother of the Lord, with James
   the son of Alphaeus and James the Little, thus making him (as well as
   also Simon and Jude) an apostle. The exceptive ei me, Gal. 1:19 (but I
   saw only James), does not prove this, but rather excludes James from
   the apostles proper (comp. ei mein Gal. 2:16; Luke 4:26, 27).

   This theory was first advanced by Jerome in 383, in a youthful polemic
   tract against Helvidius, without any traditional support, [338] but
   with the professed dogmatic and ascetic aim to save the virginity of
   both Mary and Joseph, and to reduce their marriage relation to a merely
   nominal and barren connection. In his later writings, however, after
   his residence in Palestine, he treats the question with less confidence
   (see Lightfoot, p. 253). By his authority and the still greater weight
   of St. Augustin, who at first (394) wavered between the second and
   third theories, but afterwards adopted that of Jerome, it became the
   established theory of the Latin church and was embodied in the Western
   services, which acknowledge only two saints by the name of James. But
   it is the least tenable of all and must be abandoned, chiefly for the
   following reasons:

   (a) It contradicts the natural meaning of the word "brother," when the
   New Testament has the proper term for cousin Col. 4:10, comp. also
   sungenesLuke 2:44; 21:16; Mark 6:4, etc.), and the obvious sense of the
   passages where the brothers and sisters of Jesus appear as members of
   the holy family.

   (b) It assumes that two sisters had the same name, Mary, which is
   extremely improbable.

   (c) It assumes the identity of Clopas and Alphaeus, which is equally
   doubtful; for Alphaiosis a Hebrew name (chlphy), while Klopas, like
   Kleopas, Luke 24:18, is an abbreviation of the Greek Kleopatros, as
   Antipas is contracted from Antipatros.(d) It is absolutely
   irreconcilable with the fact that the brethren of Jesus, James among
   them, were before the resurrection unbelievers, John 7:5, and
   consequently none of them could have been an apostle, as this theory
   assumes of two or three.

   Renan's theory.--I notice, in conclusion, an original combination of
   the second and third theories by Renan, who discusses the question of
   the brothers and cousins of Jesus in an appendix to his Les évangiles,
   537-540. He assumes four Jameses, and distinguishes the son of Alphaeus
   from the son of Clopas. He holds that Joseph was twice married, and
   that Jesus had several older brothers and cousins as follows:

   1. Children of Joseph from the first marriage, and older brothers of
   Jesus:

   a. James, the brother of the Lord, or Just, or Obliam. his is the one
   mentioned Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3; Gal. 1:19; 2:9, 12; 1 Cor. 15:7; Acts
   12:17, etc.; James 1:1 Jude 1:1, and in Josephus and Hegesippus.

   b. Jude, mentioned Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3; Jude 1:1; Hegesippus in
   Eusebius' Hist. Eccl. III. 19, 20, 32. From him were descended those
   two grandsons, bishops of different churches, who were presented to the
   emperor Domitian as descendants of David and relations of Jesus.
   Hegesippus in Euseb. III. 19, 20, 32

   c. Other sons and daughters unknown. Matt. 13:56; Mark 6:3; 1 Cor. 9:5.

   2. Children of Joseph (?) from the marriage with Mary:
   Jesus.

   3. Children of Clopas, and cousins of Jesus, probably from the father's
   side, since Clopas, according to Hegesippus, was a brother of Joseph,
   and may have married also a woman by the name of Mary (John 19:25).

   a. James the Little (ho mikros), so called to distinguish him from his
   older cousin of that name. Mentioned Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1;
   Luke 24:10; otherwise unknown.

   b. Joses, Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40, 47, but erroneously (?) numbered
   among the brothers of Jesus: Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3; otherwise unknown.

   c. Symeon, the second bishop of Jerusalem (Hegesippus in Eus. III. 11,
   22, 32; IV. 5, 22), also erroneously (?) put among the brothers of
   Jesus by Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3.

   d. Perhaps other sons and daughters unknown.

   II. The description of James by Hegesippus (from Eusebius, H. E. II.
   23)." Hegesippus also, who flourished nearest the days of the apostles,
   gives (in the fifth book of his Memorials) this most accurate account
   of him:

   " 'Now James, the brother of the Lord, who (as there are many of this
   name) was surnamed the Just by all (ho adelphos tou Kuriou Iakobos ho
   onomastheis hupo panton dikaios), from the Lord's time even to our own,
   received the government of the church with (or from) the apostles
   [meta, in conjunction with, or according to another reading, para ton
   apostolon, which would more clearly distinguish him from the apostles].
   This man [houtosnot this apostle] was consecrated from his mother's
   womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, and abstained from animal
   food. No razor came upon his head, he never anointed himself with oil,
   and never used a bath [probably the luxury of the Roman bath, with its
   sudatorium, frigidarium, etc., but not excluding the usual ablutions
   practised by all devout Jews]. He alone was allowed to enter the
   sanctuary [not the holy of holies, but the court of priests]. He wore
   no woolen, but linen garments only. He was in the habit of entering the
   temple alone, and was often found upon his bended knees, and
   interceding for the forgiveness of the people; so that his knees became
   as hard as a camel's, on account of his constant supplication and
   kneeling before God. And indeed, on account of his exceeding great
   piety, he was called the Just [Zaddik] and Oblias [dikaios kai oblias,
   probably a corruption of the Hebrew Ophel am, Tower of the People],
   which signifies justice and the bulwark of the people (perioche tou
   laou); as the prophets declare concerning him. Some of the seven sects
   of the people, mentioned by me above in my Memoirs, used to ask him
   what was the door, [probably the estimate or doctrine] of Jesus? and he
   answered that he was the Saviour. And of these some believed that Jesus
   is the Christ. But the aforesaid sects did not believe either a
   resurrection, or that he was coming to give to every one according to
   his works; as many, however, as did believe, did so on account of
   James. And when many of the rulers also believed, there arose a tumult
   among the Jews, Scribes, and Pharisees, saying that the whole people
   were in danger of looking for Jesus as the Messiah. They came therefore
   together, and said to James: We entreat thee, restrain the people, who
   are led astray after Jesus, as though he were the Christ. We entreat
   thee to persuade all that are coming to the feast of the Passover
   rightly concerning Jesus; for we all have confidence in thee. For we
   and all the people bear thee testimony that thou art just, and art no
   respecter of persons. Persuade therefore the people not to be led
   astray by Jesus, for we and all the people have great confidence in
   thee. Stand therefore upon the pinnacle of the temple, that thou mayest
   be conspicuous on high, and thy words may be easily heard by all the
   people; for all the tribes have come together on account of the
   Passover, with some of the Gentiles also. The aforesaid Scribes and
   Pharisees, therefore, placed James upon the pinnacle of the temple, and
   cried out to him: "O thou just man, whom we ought all to believe, since
   the people are led astray after Jesus that was crucified, declare to us
   what is the door of Jesus that was crucified." And he answered with a
   loud voice: "Why do ye ask me respecting Jesus the Son of Man? He is
   now sitting in the heavens, on the right hand of the great Power, and
   is about to come on the clouds of heaven." And as many were confirmed,
   and gloried in this testimony of James, and said:, "Hosanna to the Son
   of David," these same priests and Pharisees said to one another: "We
   have done badly in affording such testimony to Jesus, but let us go up
   and cast him down, that they may dread to believe in him." And they
   cried out: "Ho, ho, the Just himself is deceived." And they fulfilled
   that which is written in Isaiah, "Let us take away the Just, because he
   is offensive to us; wherefore they shall eat the fruit of their
   doings." [Comp. Is. 3:10.]

   And going up, they cast down the just man, saying to one another: "Let
   us stone James the Just." And they began to stone him, as he did not
   die immediately when cast down; but turning round, he knelt down,
   saying:, I entreat thee, O Lord God and Father, forgive them, for they
   know not what they do." Thus they were stoning him, when one of the
   priests of the sons of Rechab, a son of the Rechabites, spoken of by
   Jeremiah the prophet (Jer. 35:2), cried out, saying: "Cease, what are
   you doing? The Just is praying for you." And one of them, a fuller,
   beat out the brains of the Just with the club that he used to beat out
   clothes. Thus he suffered martyrdom, and they buried him on the spot
   where his tombstone is still remaining, by the temple. He became a
   faithful witness, both to the Jews and Greeks, that Jesus is the
   Christ. Immediately after this, Vespasian invaded and took Judaea.' "

   "Such," adds Eusebius, "is the more ample testimony of Hegesippus, in
   which he fully coincides with Clement. So admirable a man indeed was
   James, and so celebrated among all for his justice, that even the wiser
   part of the Jews were of opinion that this was the cause of the
   immediate siege of Jerusalem, which happened to them for no other
   reason than the crime against him. Josephus also has not hesitated to
   superadd this testimony in his works: 'These things,' says he,
   'happened to the Jews to avenge James the Just, who was the brother of
   him that is called Christ and whom the Jews had slain, notwithstanding
   his preeminent justice.' The same writer also relates his death, in the
   twentieth book of his Antiquities, in the following words,' " etc.

   Then Eusebius gives the account of Josephus.

   [324] I follow here with Credner and Lightfoot the reading Dominus
   forDomini, corresponding to the Greek translation, which reads ho
   kurios,and with the context, which points to the Lord's death rather
   than the Lord's Supper as the starting-point of the vow. See Lightfoot,
   Ep. to the Gal., p. 266. If we read "hora qu biberat calicem
   Domini,"the author of the Gospel of the Hebrews must have assumed
   either that James was one with James of Alphaeus, or that the Lord's
   Supper was not confined to the twelve apostles. Neither of these is
   probable. James is immediately afterwards called " the Just."Gregory of
   Tours (Histor. Francorum, I. 21), relating this story, adds, in
   accordance with the Greek tradition: "Hic est Jacobus Justus, quem
   fratrem Domini nuncupant, pro eo quod Josephi fuerit filius ex alia
   uxore progenitus."See Nicholson, p.

   [325] "Greeting,"chairein, Acts 15:23, and James 1:1, instead of the
   specific Christian charis kai eirene.

   [326] 1 Cor. 9:5.

   [327] Josephus calls James "the brother of Jesus the so-called
   Christ"(ton adelphon Iesou tou legomenou Christou, Iakobos onoma auto
   ), but these words an regarded by some critics (Lardner, Credner, and
   others) as a Christian interpolation.

   [328] Neander, Ewald, and Renan give the preference to the date of
   Josephus. But according to the pseudo-Clementine literature James
   survived Peter.

   [329] See below, Note II.

   [330] Gal. 2:12. How far the unnamed messengers of James from
   Jerusalem, who intimidated Peter and Barnabas at Antioch, acted under
   authority from James, does not appear; but it is certain from 2:9, as
   well as from the Acts, that James recognized the peculiar divine grace
   and success of Paul and Barnabas in the conversion of the Gentiles; he
   could therefore not without gross inconsistency make common cause with
   his adversaries.

   [331] Even Luther, in an unguarded moment (1524), called the epistle of
   James an "epistle of straw," because he could not harmonize it with
   Paul's doctrine of justification by faith.

   [332] Ewald (vi. 608) remarks that it is just such a letter as we may
   expect from the centre of Christianity in that period, when most
   Christians were poor and oppressed by rich Jews.

   [333] The date of composition is as yet an unsolved problem, and
   critics vary between a.d. 45 and 62. Schneckenburger, Neander,
   Thiersch, Huther, Hofmann, Weiss, and Beyschlag, and among English
   divines, Alford, Bassett (who, however, wrongly vindicates the Epistle
   to James the son of Zebedee), and Plumptre assign it a very early date
   before the Council of Jerusalem (50) and the circumcision controversy,
   to which there is no allusion. On the other hand Lardner, De Wette,
   Wiesinger, Lange, Ewald, and also those commentators who see in the
   Epistle a polemical reference to Paul and his teaching, bring it down
   to 62. At all events, it was written before the destruction of
   Jerusalem, which would have been noticed by a later writer. The
   Tübingen school (Baur, Schwegler, Hilgenfeld) deny its genuineness and
   assign it to a.d. 80 or 90. Renan admits the genuineness of the
   Epistles of James and Jude, as counter-manifestoes of Jewish
   Christianity against Paulinism, and accounts for the good Greek style
   by the aid of a Greek secretary.

   [334] See the lists of parallel passages in Plumptre, pp. 7-9 and 33.

   was, I brother of Joseph and an uncle of Jesus. He never calls Symeon
   "brother of the Lord," but only James and Jude (II. 23; III. 20).

   [338] The passage quoted from Papias Maria Cleophae sive Alphaei uxor,
   quae fuit mater Jacobi episcopi et apostoli,"is taken from Jerome and
   belongs not to the sub-apostolic Papias of Hierapolis (as has been
   supposed even by Mill and Wordsworth), but to a mediaeval Papias, the
   writer of an Elementarium or Dictionary in the 11th century. See
   Lightfoot, p. 265 sq.

   § 28. Preparation for the Mission to the Gentiles.

   The planting of the church among the Gentiles is mainly the work of
   Paul; but Providence prepared the way for it by several steps, before
   this apostle entered upon his sublime mission.

   1. By the conversion of those half-Gentiles and bitter enemies of the
   Jews, the Samaritans, under the preaching and baptism of Philip the
   evangelist, one of the seven deacons of Jerusalem, and under the
   confirming instruction of the apostles Peter and John. The gospel found
   ready entrance into Samaria, as had been prophetically hinted by the
   Lord in the conversation at Jacob's well. [339] But there we meet also
   the first heretical perversion of Christianity by Simon Magus, whose
   hypocrisy and attempt to degrade the gift of the Holy Spirit received
   from Peter a terrible rebuke. (Hence the term simony, for sordid
   traffic in church offices and dignities.) This encounter of the prince
   of the apostles with the arch-heretic was regarded in the ancient
   church, and fancifully represented, as typifying the relation of
   ecclesiastical orthodoxy to deceptive heresy.

   2. Somewhat later (between 37 and 40) occurred the conversion of the
   noble centurion, Cornelius of Caesarea, a pious proselyte of the gate,
   whom Peter, in consequence of a special revelation, received into the
   communion of the Christian church directly by baptism, without
   circumcision. This bold step the apostle had to vindicate to the strict
   Jewish Christians in Jerusalem, who thought circumcision a condition of
   salvation, and Judaism the only way to Christianity. Thus Peter laid
   the foundation also of the Gentile-Christian church. The event marked a
   revolution in Peter's mind, and his emancipation from the narrow
   prejudices of Judaism. [340]

   3. Still more important was the rise, at about the same time, of the
   church at Antioch the capital of Syria. This congregation formed under
   the influence of the Hellenist Barnabas of Cyprus and Paul of Tarsus,
   seems to have consisted from the first of converted heathens and Jews.
   It thus became the mother of Gentile Christendom, as Jerusalem was the
   mother and centre of Jewish. In Antioch, too, the name "Christian"
   first appeared, which was soon everywhere adopted, as well denoting the
   nature and mission as the followers of Christ, the divine-human
   prophet, priest, and king. [341]

   The other and older designations were disciples (of Christ the only
   Master), believers (in Christ as their Saviour), brethren (as members
   of the same family of the redeemed, bound together by a love which
   springs not from earth and will never cease), and saints (as those who
   are purified and consecrated to the service of God and called to
   perfect holiness).

   Christianity."--Dr. Baur (Paul, II. 281, English translation).

   "Did St. Paul's life end with his own life? May we not rather believe
   that in a sense higher than Chrysostom ever dreamt of [when he gave him
   the glorious name of 'the Heart of the world'], the pulses of that
   mighty heart are still the pulses of the world's life, still beat in
   these later ages with even greater force than ever?"--Dean Stanley
   (Sermons and Essays on the Apostolic Age. p. 166).

   § 29. Sources and Literature on St. Paul and his Work.

   I. Sources.

   1. The authentic sources:

   The Epistles of Paul, and the Acts of the Apostles 9:1-30 and 13 to 28.
   Of the Epistles of Paul the four most important Galatians, Romans, two
   Corinthians--are universally acknowledged as genuine even by the most
   exacting critics; the Philippians, Philemon, Colossians, and Ephesians
   are admitted by nearly all critics; the Pastoral Epistles, especially
   First Timothy, and Titus, are more or less disputed, but even they bear
   the stamp of Paul's genius.

   On the coincidences between the Acts and the Epistles see the section
   on the Acts. Comp. also § 22, pp. 213 sqq.

   2. The legendary and apocryphal sources:

   Acta Pauli et Theclae, edition in Greek by E. Grabe (from a Bodleian
   MS. in Spicileg. SS. PP., Oxon. 1698, tom. I. pp. 95-128; republished
   by Jones, 1726), and by Tischendorf (from three Paris MSS, in Acta
   Apost. Apocrypha, Lips. 1851); in Syriac, with an English version by W.
   Wright (in Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, Lond. 1871); Engl. transl.
   by Alex. Walker (in Clark's "Ante-Nicene Christian Library," vol. XVI.
   279 sqq.). Comp. C. Schlau: Die Acten des Paulus und der Thecla und die
   ältere Thecla-Legende, Leipz. 1877.

   The Acts of Paul and Thecla strongly advocate celibacy. They are
   probably of Gnostic origin and based on some local tradition. They were
   originally written, according to Tertullian (De Bapt. cap. 17, comp.
   Jerome, Catal. cap. 7), by a presbyter in Asia "out of love to Paul,"
   and in support of the heretical opinion that women have the right to
   preach and to baptize after the example of Thecla; hence the author was
   deposed. The book was afterwards purged of its most obnoxious features
   and extensively used in the Catholic church. (See the patristic
   quotations in Tischendorf's Prolegomena, p. xxiv.) Thecla is
   represented as a noble virgin of Iconium, in Lycaonia, who was
   betrothed to Thamyris, converted by Paul in her seventeenth year,
   consecrated herself to perpetual virginity, was persecuted, carried to
   the stake, and thrown before wild beasts, but miraculously delivered,
   and died 90 years old at Seleucia. In the Greek church she is
   celebrated as the first female martyr. Paul is described at the
   beginning of this book (Tischend. p. 41) as "little in stature,
   bald-headed, bow-legged, well-built (or vigorous), with knitted
   eye-brows, rather long-nosed, full of grace, appearing now as a man,
   and now having the face of an angel." From this description Renan has
   borrowed in part his fancy-sketch of Paul's personal appearance.

   Acta Pauli (Praxeis Paulou], used by Origen and ranked by Eusebiu" with
   the Antilegomena »or notharather). They are, like the Acta Petri
   (Praxeis, orPeriodoi Petrou), a Gnostic reconstruction of the canonical
   Acts and ascribed to the authorship of St. Linus. Preserved only in
   fragments.

   Acta Petri et Pauli. A Catholic adaptation of an Ebionite work. The
   Greek and Latin text was published first in a complete form by Thilo,
   Halle, 1837-'38, the Greek by Tischendorf (who collated six MSS.) in
   his Acta Apost. Apoc. 1851, 1-39; English transl. byWalker in
   "Ante-Nicene Libr., " XVI. 256 sqq. This book records the arrival of
   Paul in Rome, his meeting with Peter and Simon Magus, their trial
   before the tribunal of Nero, and the martyrdom of Peter by crucifixion,
   and of Paul by decapitation. The legend of Domine quo vadis is here
   recorded of Peter, and the story of Perpetua is interwoven with the
   martyrdom of Paul.

   The pseudo-Clementine Homilies, of the middle of the second century or
   later, give a malignant Judaizing caricature of Paul under the disguise
   of Simon Magus (in part at least), and misrepresent him as an
   antinomian arch-heretic; while Peter, the proper hero of this romance,
   is glorified as the apostle of pure, primitive Christianity.

   The Correspondence of Paul and Seneca, mentioned by Jerome (De vir.
   ill. c. 12) and Augustin (Ep. ad Maced. 153, al. 54), and often copied,
   though with many variations, edited by Fabricius, Cod. Apocr. N. T.,
   and in several editions of Seneca. It consists of eight letters of
   Seneca and six of Paul. They are very poor in thought and style, full
   of errors of chronology and history, and undoubtedly a forgery. They
   arose from the correspondence of the moral maxims of Seneca with those
   of Paul, which is more apparent than real, and from the desire to
   recommend the Stoic philosopher to the esteem of the Christians, or to
   recommend Christianity to the students of Seneca and the Stoic
   philosophy. Paul was protected at Corinth by Seneca's brother, Gallio
   (Acts 18:12-16), and might have become acquainted with the philosopher
   who committed suicide at Rome in 65, but there is no trace of such
   acquaintance. Comp. Amédée Fleury: Saint-Paul et Sénèque (Paris, 1853,

   the Romans (1836), and a Latin programme on Stephen's address before
   the Sanhedrin (1829). It marks an epoch in the literature on Paul and
   opened new avenues of research. It is the standard work of the Tübingen

   § 30. Paul before his Conversion.

   His Natural Outfit.

   We now approach the apostle of the Gentiles who decided the victory of
   Christianity as a universal religion, who labored more, both in word
   and deed, than all his colleagues, and who stands out, in lonely
   grandeur, the most remarkable and influential character in history. His
   youth as well as his closing years are involved in obscurity, save that
   he began a persecutor and ended a martyr, but the midday of his life is
   better known than that of any other apostle, and is replete with
   burning thoughts and noble deeds that can never die, and gather
   strength with the progress of the gospel from age to age and country to
   country.

   Saul or Paul [342] was of strictly Jewish parentage, but was born, a
   few years after Christ, [343] in the renowned Grecian commercial and
   literary city of Tarsus, in the province of Cilicia, and inherited the
   rights of a Roman citizen. He received a learned Jewish education at
   Jerusalem in the school of the Pharisean Rabbi, Gamaliel, a grandson of
   Hillel, not remaining an entire stranger to Greek literature, as his
   style, his dialectic method, his allusions to heathen religion and
   philosophy, and his occasional quotations from heathen poets show.
   Thus, a "Hebrew of the Hebrews," [344] yet at the same time a native
   Hellenist, and a Roman citizen, be combined in himself, so to speak,
   the three great nationalities of the ancient world, and was endowed
   with all the natural qualifications for a universal apostleship. He
   could argue with the Pharisees as a son of Abraham, of the tribe of
   Benjamin, and as a disciple of the renowned Gamaliel, surnamed "the
   Glory of the Law." He could address the Greeks in their own beautiful
   tongue and with the convincing force of their logic. Clothed with the
   dignity and majesty of the Roman people, he could travel safely over
   the whole empire with the proud watchword: Civis Romanus sum.

   This providential outfit for his future work made him for a while the
   most dangerous enemy of Christianity, but after his conversion its most
   useful promoter. The weapons of destruction were turned into weapons of
   construction. The engine was reversed, and the direction changed; but
   it remained the same engine, and its power was increased under the new
   inspiration.

   The intellectual and moral endowment of Saul was of the highest order.
   The sharpest thinking was blended with the tenderest feeling, the
   deepest mind with the strongest will. He had Semitic fervor, Greek
   versatility, and Roman energy. Whatever he was, he was with his whole
   soul. He was totus in illis, a man of one idea and of one purpose,
   first as a Jew, then as a Christian. His nature was martial and heroic.
   Fear was unknown to him--except the fear of God, which made him
   fearless of man. When yet a youth, he had risen to high eminence; and
   had he remained a Jew, he might have become a greater Rabbi than even
   Hillel or Gamaliel, as he surpassed them both in original genius and
   fertility of thought.

   Paul was the only scholar among the apostles. He never displays his
   learning, considering it of no account as compared with the excellency
   of the knowledge of Christ, for whom he suffered the loss of all
   things, [345] but he could not conceal it, and turned it to the best
   use after his conversion. Peter and John had natural genius, but no
   scholastic education; Paul had both, and thus became the founder of
   Christian theology and philosophy.

   His Education.

   His training was thoroughly Jewish, rooted and grounded in the
   Scriptures of the Old Covenant, and those traditions of the elders
   which culminated in the Talmud. [346] He knew the Hebrew and Greek
   Bible almost by heart. In his argumentative epistles, when addressing
   Jewish converts, he quotes from the Pentateuch, the Prophets, the
   Psalms, now literally, now freely, sometimes ingeniously combining
   several passages or verbal reminiscences, or reading between the lines
   in a manner which betrays the profound student and master of the hidden
   depths of the word of God, and throws a flood of light on obscure
   passages. [347] He was quite familiar with the typical and allegorical
   methods of interpretation; and he occasionally and incidentally uses
   Scriptural arguments, or illustrations rather, which strike a sober
   scholar as far-fetched and fanciful, though they were quite conclusive
   to a Jewish reader. [348] But he never bases a truth on such an
   illustration without an independent argument; he never indulges in the
   exegetical impositions and frivolities of those "letter-worshipping
   Rabbis who prided themselves on suspending dogmatic mountains by
   textual hairs." Through the revelation of Christ, the Old Testament,
   instead of losing itself in the desert of the Talmud or the labyrinth
   of the Kabbala, became to him a book of life, full of types and
   promises of the great facts and truths of the gospel salvation. In
   Abraham he saw the father of the faithful, in Habakkuk a preacher of
   justification by faith, in the paschal lamb a type of Christ slain for
   the sins of the world, in the passage of Israel through the Red Sea a
   prefigurement of Christian baptism, and in the manna of the wilderness
   a type of the bread of life in the Lord's Supper.

   The Hellenic culture of Paul is a matter of dispute, denied by some,
   unduly exalted by others. He no doubt acquired in the home of his
   boyhood and early manhood [349] a knowledge of the Greek language, for
   Tarsus was at that time the seat of one of the three universities of
   the Roman empire, surpassing in some respects even Athens and
   Alexandria, and furnished tutors to the imperial family. His teacher,
   Gamaliel, was comparatively free from the rabbinical abhorrence and
   contempt of heathen literature. After his conversion he devoted his
   life to the salvation of the heathen, and lived for years at Tarsus,
   Ephesus, Corinth, and other cities of Greece, and became a Greek to the
   Greeks in order to save them. It is scarcely conceivable that a man of
   universal human sympathies, and so wide awake to the deepest problems
   of thought, as he, should have under such circumstances taken no notice
   of the vast treasures of Greek philosophy, poetry, and history. He
   would certainly do what we expect every missionary to China or India to
   do from love to the race which he is to benefit, and from a desire to
   extend his usefulness. Paul very aptly, though only incidentally,
   quotes three times from Greek poets, not only a proverbial maxim from
   Menander, [350] and a hexameter from Epimenides, [351] which may have
   passed into common use, but also a half-hexameter with a connecting
   particle, which he must have read in the tedious astronomical poem of
   his countryman, Aratus (about b.c. 270), or in the sublime hymn of
   Cleanthes to Jupiter, in both of which the passage occurs. [352] He
   borrows some of his favorite metaphors from the Grecian games; he
   disputed with Greek philosophers of different schools and addressed
   them from the Areopagus with consummate wisdom and adaptation to the
   situation; some suppose that he alludes even to the terminology of the
   Stoic philosophy when he speaks of the "rudiments" or "elements of the
   world." [353] He handles the Greek language, not indeed with classical
   purity and elegance, yet with an almost creative vigor, transforming it
   into an obedient organ of new ideas, and pressing into his service the
   oxymoron, the paronomasia, the litotes, and other rhetorical figures.
   [354] Yet all this does by no means prove a regular study or extensive
   knowledge of Greek literature, but is due in part to native genius. His
   more than Attic urbanity and gentlemanly refinement which breathe in
   his Epistles to Philemon and the Philippians, must be traced to the
   influence of Christianity rather than his intercourse with accomplished
   Greeks. His Hellenic learning seems to have been only casual,
   incidental, and altogether subordinate to his great aim. In this
   respect he differed widely from the learned Josephus, who affected
   Attic purity of style, and from Philo, who allowed the revealed truth
   of the Mosaic religion to be controlled, obscured, and perverted by
   Hellenic philosophy. Philo idealized and explained away the Old
   Testament by allegorical impositions which he substituted for
   grammatical expositions; Paul spiritualized the Old Testament and drew
   out its deepest meaning. Philo's Judaism evaporated in speculative
   abstractions, Paul's Judaism was elevated and transformed into
   Christian realities.

   His Zeal for Judaism.

   Saul was a Pharisee of the strictest sect, not indeed of the
   hypocritical type, so witheringly rebuked by our Saviour, but of the
   honest, truth-loving and truth-seeking sort, like that of Nicodemus and
   Gamaliel. His very fanaticism in persecution arose from the intensity
   of his conviction and his zeal for the religion of his fathers. He
   persecuted in ignorance, and that diminished, though it did not
   abolish, his guilt. He probably never saw or heard Jesus until he
   appeared to him at Damascus. He may have been at Tarsus at the time of
   the crucifixion and resurrection. [355] But with his Pharisaic
   education he regarded Jesus of Nazareth, like his teachers, as a false
   Messiah, a rebel, a blasphemer, who was justly condemned to death. And
   he acted according to his conviction. He took the most prominent part
   in the persecution of Stephen and delighted in his death. Not satisfied
   with this, he procured from the Sanhedrin, which had the oversight of
   all the synagogues and disciplinary punishments for offences against
   the law, full power to persecute and arrest the scattered disciples.
   Thus armed, he set out for Damascus, the capital of Syria, which
   numbered many synagogues. He was determined to exterminate the
   dangerous sect from the face of the earth, for the glory of God. But
   the height of his opposition was the beginning of his devotion to
   Christianity.

   His External Relations and Personal Appearance.

   On the subordinate questions of Paul's external condition and relations
   we have no certain information. Being a Roman citizen, he belonged to
   the respectable class of society, but must have been poor; for he
   depended for support on a trade which he learned in accordance with
   rabbinical custom; it was the trade of tent-making, very common in
   Cilicia, and not profitable except in large cities. [356]

   He had a sister living at Jerusalem whose son was instrumental in
   saving his life. [357]

   He was probably never married. Some suppose that he was a widower.
   Jewish and rabbinical custom, the completeness of his moral character,
   his ideal conception of marriage as reflecting the mystical union of
   Christ with his church, his exhortations to conjugal, parental, and
   filial duties, seem to point to experimental knowledge of domestic
   life. But as a Christian missionary moving from place to place, and
   exposed to all sorts of hardship and persecution, he felt it his duty
   to abide alone. [358] He sacrificed the blessings of home and family to
   the advancement of the kingdom of Christ. [359]

   His "bodily presence was weak, and his speech contemptible" (of no
   value), in the superficial judgment of the Corinthians, who missed the
   rhetorical ornaments, yet could not help admitting that his "letters
   were weighty and strong." [360] Some of the greatest men have been
   small in size, and some of the purest souls forbidding in body.
   Socrates was the homeliest, and yet the wisest of Greeks. Neander, a
   converted Jew, like Paul, was short, feeble, and strikingly odd in his
   whole appearance, but a rare humility, benignity, and heavenly
   aspiration beamed from his face beneath his dark and bushy eyebrows. So
   we may well imagine that the expression of Paul's countenance was
   highly intellectual and spiritual, and that he looked "sometimes like a
   man and sometimes like an angel." [361]

   He was afflicted with a mysterious, painful, recurrent, and repulsive
   physical infirmity, which he calls a "thorn in the flesh, " and which
   acted as a check upon spiritual pride and self-exultation over his
   abundance of revelations. [362] He bore the heavenly treasure in an
   earthly vessel and his strength was made perfect in weakness. [363] But
   all the more must we admire the moral heroism which turned weakness
   itself into an element of strength, and despite pain and trouble and
   persecution carried the gospel salvation triumphantly from Damascus to
   Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [342] "Paul" (Little) is merely the Hellenized or Latinized form for
   his Hebrew name "Saul" (Desired), and has nothing whatever to do either
   with his own conversion, or with the conversion of Sergius Paulus of
   Cyprus. There are many similar instances of double names among the Jews
   of that time, as Hillel and Pollio, Cephas and Peter, John and Mark,
   Barsabbas and Justus, Simeon and Niger, Silas and Silvanus. Paul may
   have received his Latin name in early youth in Tarsus, as a Roman
   citizen; Paulus being the cognomen of several distinguished Roman
   families, as the gens AEmilia, Fabia, Julia, Sergia. He used it in his
   intercourse with the Gentiles and in all his Epistles. See Hist. Apost.
   Ch., p. 226, and my annotations to Lange on Romans 1:1, pp. 57 and 58.

   [343] When Paul wrote to Philemon, a.d. 63, he was an aged man
   (presbutes, Phil. 9), that is, about or above sixty. According to
   Hippocrates a man was called presbutes from forty-nine to fifty-six,
   and after that geron, senes. In a friendly letter to a younger friend
   and pupil the expression must not be pressed. Walter Scott speaks of
   himself as "an old grey man" at fifty-five. Paul was still a "youth"
   (neanias, Acts 7:58) at the stoning of Stephen, which probably took
   place in 37; and although this term is likewise vaguely used, yet as he
   was then already clothed with a most important mission by the
   Sanhedrin, he must have been about or over thirty years of age. Philo
   extends the limits of neanias from twenty-one to twenty-eight, Xenophon
   to forty. Comp. Lightfoot on Philemon, v. 9 (p. 405), and Farrar, I.,
   13, 14.

   [344] Phil. 3:5. A Hebrew by descent and education, though a Hellenist
   or Jew of the dispersion by birth, Acts 22:3. Probably his parents were
   Palestinians. This would explain the erroneous tradition preserved by
   Jerome (De vir. ill. c. 5), that Paul was born at Giscala in Galilee
   (now El-Jish), and after the capture of the place by the Romans
   emigrated with his parents to Tarsus. But the capture did not take
   place till a.d. 67.

   [345] Comp. the sublime passage, Phil. 3:8-10, and 1 Cor. 2:1, 2.

   [346] Gal. 4:14: "I made progress in Judaism beyond many of mine own
   age in my nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of
   my fathers."

   [347] Scripture references and allusions abound in the Galatians,
   Romans, and Corinthians, but are wanting in the Thessalonians,
   Colossians, and Philemon, and in his address to the heathen hearers at
   Athens, whom he referred to their own poets rather than to Moses and
   the prophets.

   [348] As the reasoning from the singular or rather collective
   sperma(zera)in Gal. 3:16, the allegorical interpretation of Hagar and
   Sarah, 4:22 sqq., and the rock in the wilderness, 1 Cor. 10:1-4. See
   the commentaries.

   [349] Comp. Gal. 1:21; Acts 9:30; 11:25.

   [350] 1 Cor. 15:33. phtheirousin ethe chresta homiliai kakai. "Evil
   associations corrupt good manners."

   [351] Tit. 1:12. Kretes aei pseustai, kaka theria, gasteres argai.
   "Cretans are liars alway, bad beasts, and indolent gluttons." As
   Epimenides was himself a Cretan, this contemptuous depreciation of his
   countrymen gave rise to the syllogistic puzzle: "Epimenides calls the
   Cretans liars; Epimenides was a Cretan: therefore Epimenides was a
   liar: therefore the Cretans were not liars: therefore Epimenides was
   not a liar," etc.

   [352] Acts 17:28. Tou [poetic for toutou] gar kai genos esmen. "For we
   are also His (God's) offspring." The passage occurs literally in the
   Phoenomena of Aratus, v. 5, in the following connection: ...." We all
   greatly need Zeus, For we are his offspring; full of grace, he grants
   men Tokens of favor .... The Stoic poet, Cleanthes (Hymn. in Jovem, 5)
   uses the same expression in an address to Jupiter: Ek sou gar genos
   esmen, and in the Golden Poem, theion gar genos esti brotoisin. We may
   also quote a parallel passage of Pindar, Nem. VI., which has been
   overlooked by commentators: Hen andron, hen theon genos, ek mias de
   pneomen matros amphoteroi. " One race of men and gods, from one mother
   breathe we all." It is evident, however, that all these passages were
   understood by their heathen authors in a materialistic and pantheistic
   sense, which would make nature or the earth the mother of gods and men.
   Paul in his masterly address to the Athenians, without endorsing the
   error, recognizes the element of truth in pantheism, viz., the divine
   origin of man and the immanence of God in the world and in humanity.

   [353] ta stoicheia tou kosmou, Gal. 4:3, 9. So Hilgenfeld, Einleitung,
   p. 223. Thiersch assumes (p. 112) that Paul was familiar with the
   Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle, and that his dialectics is classical
   rather than rabbinical; but this is scarcely correct. In Romans 5:16,
   18, he uses the word dikaioma in the Aristotelian sense of legal
   adjustment (Rechtsausgleichung). See Eth. Nicom. v. 10, and Rothe's
   monograph on Rom. 5:12-21. Baur compares Paul's style with that of
   Thucydides.

   [354] Farrar, I. 629 sq., counts "upwards of fifty specimens of thirty
   Greek rhetorical figures in St. Paul," which certainly disprove the
   assertion of Renan that Paul could never have received even elementary
   lessons in grammar and rhetoric at Tarsus.

   [355] Cor. 9:1 refers to the vision of Christ at Damascus. In 2 Cor.
   5:16: though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth
   know we him no more," he particles ei kai (quamquam, even though, wenn
   auch) seem to chronicle a fact, as distinct from kai ei (etiam si, even
   if, selbst wenn), which puts an hypothesis; but the stress lies on the
   difference between an external, carnal knowledge of Christ in his
   humility and earthly relations or a superficial acquaintance from
   hearsay, and a spiritual, experimental knowledge of Christ in his
   glory. Farrar (I. 73 sqq.), reasons that if Paul had really known and
   heard Jesus, he would have been converted at once.

   [356] He is called a tent-maker, skenopoios, Acts 18:3. Tents were
   mostly made of the coarse hair of the Cilician goat (Kilikios tragos,
   which also denotes a coarse man), and needed by shepherds, travellers,
   sailors, and soldiers. The same material was also used for mantelets,
   shoes, and beds. The Cilician origin of this article is perpetuated in
   the Latin cilicium and the French cilice, which means hair-cloth.
   Gamaliel is the author of the maxim that " learning of any kind
   unaccompanied by a trade ends in nothing and leads to sin."

   [357] Acts 23:16.

   [358] In 1 Cor. 9:5 (written in 57) he claims the right to lead a
   married life, like Peter and the other apostles, and the brethren of
   the Lord; but in 1 Cor. 7:7, 8 he gives for himself in his peculiar
   position the preference to single life. Clement of Alexandria, Erasmus,
   and others supposed that he was married, and understood Syzyge, in
   Phil. 4:3, to be his wife. Ewald regards him as a widower who lost his
   wife before his conversion (VI. 341). So also Farrar (I. 80) who infers
   from 1 Cor. 7:8 that Paul classed himself with widowers: "I say,
   therefore, to the unmarried [to widowers, for whom there is no special
   Greek word] and widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I."
   He lays stress on the fact that the Jews in all ages attached great
   importance to marriage as a moral duty (Gen. 1:28), and preferred early
   marriage; he also maintains (I. 169) that Paul, being a member of the
   Sanhedrin (as he gave his vote for the condemnation of the Christiana,
   Acts26:10), must have had, according to the Gemara, a family of his
   own. Renan fancies (ch. VI.) that Paul contracted a more than spiritual
   union with sister Lydia at Philippi, and addressed her in Phil. 4:3 as
   his suzuge gnesie, that is, as his true co-worker or partner (conjux),
   since it is not likely that he would have omitted her when he
   mentioned, in the preceding verse, two deaconesses otherwise unknown,
   Euodia and Syntyche. The word suzugos, as a noun, may be either
   masculine or feminine, and may either mean generally an associate, a
   co-worker ("yoke -fellow" in the E. V.), or be a proper name. Several
   persons have been suggested, Epaphroditus, Timothy, Silas, Luke. But
   Paul probably means a man, named Suzugosand plays upon the word:
   "Yokefellow by name and yoke-fellow in deed." Comp. a similar
   paronomasia in Philem. 10, 11Onesimon, i.e., Helpful,-achreston,
   euchreston , unprofitable, profitable). See the notes of Meyer and
   Lange (Braune and Hackett) on these passages.

   [359] This sublime loneliness of Paul is well expressed in a poem,
   Saint Paul, by Frederic W. H. Myers (1868), from which we may be
   permitted to quote a few lines: "Christ! I am Christ's! and let the
   name suffice you;
   Aye, for me, too, He greatly hath sufficed; Lo, with no winning words I
   would entice you;
   Paul has no honor and no friend but Christ.
   " Yes, without cheer of sister or of daughter--
   Yes, w ithout stay of father or of son, Lone on the land, and homeless
   on the water,
   Pass I in patience till the work be done.
   "Yet not in solitude, if Christ anear me
   Waketh Him workers for the great employ; Oh, not in solitude, if souls
   that hear me
   Catch from my joyance the surprise of joy.
   Hearts I have won of sister or of brother,
   Quick on the earth or hidden in the sod Lo, every heart awaiteth me,
   another
   Friend in the blameless family of God."

   [360] 2 Cor. 10:10 he parousia tou somatos asthenes , kai ho logos
   exouthenemenos, or, as Cod. B. reads, exoudenemenos, which has the same
   meaning. Comp. 10:1, where he speaks of his " lowly" personal
   appearance among the Corinthians (kataprosopon tapeinos). He was
   little, compared with Barnabas (Acts 14:12).

   [361] This is from the tradition preserved in the apocryphal Acts of
   Thecla. See the description quoted above, p. 282. Other ancient
   descriptions of Paul in the Philopatris of pseudo-Lucian (of the
   second, but more probably of the fourth century), Malala of Antioch
   (sixth century), and Nicephorus (fifteenth century), represent Paul as
   little in stature, bald, with a prominent aquiline nose, gray hair and
   thick beard, bright grayish eyes, somewhat bent and stooping, yet
   pleasant and graceful. See these descriptions in Lewin's St. Paul, II.
   412. The oldest extant portraiture of Paul, probably from the close of
   the first or beginning of the second century, was found on a large
   bronze medallion in the cemetery of Domitilla (one of the Flavian
   family), and is preserved in the Vatican library. It presents Paul on
   the left and Peter on the right. Both are far from handsome, but full
   of character; Paul is the homelier of the two, with apparently diseased
   eyes, open mouth, bald head and short thick beard, but thoughtful,
   solemn, and dignified. See a cut in Lewin, II. 211. Chrysostom calls
   Paul the three-cubit man (ho tripechus anthropos, Serm. in Pet. et
   Paul.). Luther imagined: "St. Paulus war ein armes, dürres Männlein,
   wie Magister Philippus "(Melanchthon). A poetic description by J. H.
   Newman see in Farrar I. 220, and in Plumptre on Acts, Appendix, with
   another (of his own). Renan (Les Apôtres, pp. 169 sqq.) gives, partly
   from Paul's Epistles, partly from apocryphal sources, the following
   striking picture of the apostle: His behavior was winning, his manners
   excellent, his letters reveal a man of genius and lofty aspirations,
   though the style is incorrect. Never did a correspondence display rarer
   courtesies, tenderer shades, more amiable modesty and reserve. Once or
   twice we are wounded by his sarcasm (Gal. 5: 12; Phil. 3:2). But what
   rapture! What fulness of charming words! What originality! His exterior
   did not correspond to the greatness of his soul. He was ugly, short,
   stout, plump, of small head, bald, pale, his face covered with a thick
   beard, an eagle nose, piercing eyes, dark eyebrows. His speech,
   embarrassed, faulty, gave a poor idea of his eloquence. With rare tact
   he turned his external defects to advantage. The Jewish race produces
   types of the highest beauty and of the most complete homeliness (des
   types de la plus grande beauté et de la plus complète laideur); but the
   Jewish homeliness is quite unique. The strange faces which provoke
   laughter at first sight, assume when intellectually enlivened, a
   peculiar expression of intense brilliancy and majesty (une sorte
   d'éclat profond et de majesté).

   2:3; 2 Cor. 1:8, 9; 4:10. Of the many conjectures only three: sick
   headache, acute ophthalmia, epilepsy, seem to answer the allusions of
   Paul which are dark to us at such a distance of time, while they were
   clear to his personal friends. Tertullian and Jerome, according to an
   ancient tradition, favor headache; Lewin, Farrar, and many others, sore
   eyes, dating the inflammation from the dazzling light which shone
   around him at Damascus (Acts 9:3, 17, 18; Comp. 22:13; 23:3, 5; Gal.
   4:15); Ewald and Lightfoot, epilepsy, with illustration from the life
   of King Alfred (Mohammed would be even more to the point). Other
   conjectures of external, or spiritual trials (persecution, carnal
   temptations, bad temper, doubt, despondency, blasphemous suggestions of
   the devil, etc.) are ruled out by a strict exegesis of the two chief
   passages in 2 Cor. 12 and Gal. 4, which point to a physical malady. See

   § 31. The Conversion of Paul.

   Eudokesen ho theos ... apokalupsai ton huion autou en emoi, hina
   euangelizomai auton en tois ethnesin Gal. 1:15, 16.

   The conversion of Paul marks not only a turning-point in his personal
   history, but also an important epoch in the history of the apostolic
   church, and consequently in the history of mankind. It was the most
   fruitful event since the miracle of Pentecost, and secured the
   universal victory of Christianity.

   The transformation of the most dangerous persecutor into the most
   successful promoter of Christianity is nothing less than a miracle of
   divine grace. It rests on the greater miracle of the resurrection of
   Christ. Both are inseparably connected; without the resurrection the
   conversion would have been impossible, and on the other hand the
   conversion of such a man and with such results is one of the strongest
   proofs of the resurrection.

   The bold attack of Stephen--the forerunner of Paul--upon the hard,
   stiff-necked Judaism which had crucified the Messiah, provoked a
   determined and systematic attempt on the part of the Sanhedrin to
   crucify Jesus again by destroying his church. In this struggle for life
   and death Saul the Pharisee, the bravest and strongest of the rising
   rabbis, was the willing and accepted leader.

   After the martyrdom of Stephen and the dispersion of the congregation
   of Jerusalem, he proceeded to Damascus in suit of the fugitive
   disciples of Jesus, as a commissioner of the Sanhedrin, a sort of
   inquisitor-general, with full authority and determination to stamp out
   the Christian rebellion, and to bring all the apostates he could find,
   whether they were men or women, in chains to the holy city to be
   condemned by the chief priests.

   Damascus is one of the oldest cities in the world, known in the days of
   Abraham, and bursts upon the traveller like a vision of paradise amidst
   a burning and barren wilderness of sand; it is watered by the
   never-failing rivers Abana and Pharpar (which Naaman of old preferred
   to all the waters of Israel), and embosomed in luxuriant gardens of
   flowers and groves of tropical fruit trees; hence glorified by Eastern
   poets as "the Eye of the Desert."

   But a far higher vision than this earthly paradise was in store for
   Saul as he approached the city. A supernatural light from heaven,
   brighter than the Syrian sun, suddenly flashed around him at midday,
   and Jesus of Nazareth, whom he persecuted in his humble disciples,
   appeared to him in his glory as the exalted Messiah, asking him in the
   Hebrew tongue: "Shaûl, Shaûl, why persecutest thou Me? [364] It was a
   question both of rebuke and of love, and it melted his heart. He fell
   prostrate to the ground. He saw and heard, he trembled and obeyed, he
   believed and rejoiced. As he rose from the earth he saw no man. Like a
   helpless child, blinded by the dazzling light, he was led to Damascus,
   and after three days of blindness and fasting he was cured and
   baptized--not by Peter or James or John, but--by one of the humble
   disciples whom he had come to destroy. The haughty, self-righteous,
   intolerant, raging Pharisee was changed into an humble, penitent,
   grateful, loving servant of Jesus. He threw away self-righteousness,
   learning, influence, power, prospects, and cast in his lot with a
   small, despised sect at the risk of his life. If there ever was an
   honest, unselfish, radical, and effective change of conviction and
   conduct, it was that of Saul of Tarsus. He became, by a creative act of
   the Holy Spirit, a "new creature in Christ Jesus." [365]

   We have three full accounts of this event in the Acts, one from Luke,
   two from Paul himself, with slight variations in detail, which only
   confirm the essential harmony. [366] Paul also alludes to it five or
   six times in his Epistles. [367] In all these passages he represents
   the change as an act brought about by a direct intervention of Jesus,
   who revealed himself in his glory from heaven, and struck conviction
   into his mind like lightning at midnight. He compares it to the
   creative act of God when He commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness. [368] He lays great stress on the fact that he was converted
   and called to the apostolate directly by Christ, without any human
   agency; that he learned his gospel of free and universal grace by
   revelation, and not from the older apostles, whom he did not even see
   till three years after his call. [369]

   The conversion, indeed, was not a moral compulsion, but included the
   responsibility of assent or dissent. God converts nobody by force or by
   magic. He made man free, and acts upon him as a moral being. Paul might
   have "disobeyed the heavenly vision." [370] He might have "kicked
   against the goads," though it was "hard" (not impossible) to do so.
   [371] These words imply some psychological preparation, some doubt and
   misgiving as to his course, some moral conflict between the flesh and
   the spirit, which he himself described twenty years afterwards from
   personal experience, and which issues in the cry of despair: "O
   wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" [372] On his journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, which takes a
   full week on foot or horseback--the distance being about 140 miles--as
   he was passing, in the solitude of his own thoughts, through Samaria,
   Galilee, and across Mount Hermon, he had ample time for reflection, and
   we may well imagine how the shining face of the martyr Stephen, as he
   stood like a holy angel before the Sanhedrin, and as in the last moment
   he prayed for his murderers, was haunting him like a ghost and warning
   him to stop his mad career.

   Yet we must not overrate this preparation or anticipate his riper
   experience in the three days that intervened between his conversion and
   his baptism, and during the three years of quiet meditation in Arabia.
   He was no doubt longing for truth and for righteousness, but there was
   a thick veil over his mental eye which could only be taken away by a
   hand from without; access to his heart was barred by an iron door of
   prejudice which had to be broken in by Jesus himself. On his way to
   Damascus he was "yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the
   disciples of the Lord," and thinking he was doing "God service;" he
   was, to use his own language, "beyond measure" persecuting the church
   of God and endeavoring to destroy it, "being more exceedingly zealous
   for the traditions of his fathers" than many of his age, when "it
   pleased God to reveal his Son in him." Moreover it is only in the light
   of faith that we see the midnight darkness of our sin, and it is only
   beneath the cross of Christ that we feel the whole crushing weight of
   guilt and the unfathomable depth of God's redeeming love. No amount of
   subjective thought and reflection could have brought about that radical
   change in so short a time. It was the objective appearance of Jesus
   that effected it.

   This appearance implied the resurrection and the ascension, and this
   was the irresistible evidence of His Messiahship, God's own seal of
   approval upon the work of Jesus. And the resurrection again shed a new
   light upon His death on the cross, disclosing it as an atoning
   sacrifice for the sins of the world, as the means of procuring pardon
   and peace consistent with the claims of divine justice. What a
   revelation! That same Jesus of Nazareth whom he hated and persecuted as
   a false prophet justly crucified between two robbers, stood before Saul
   as the risen, ascended, and glorified Messiah! And instead of crushing
   the persecutor as he deserved, He pardoned him and called him to be His
   witness before Jews and Gentiles! This revelation was enough for an
   orthodox Jew waiting for the hope of Israel to make him a Christian,
   and enough for a Jew of such force of character to make him an earnest
   and determined Christian. The logic of his intellect and the energy of
   his will required that he should love and promote the new faith with
   the same enthusiasm with which he had hated and persecuted it; for
   hatred is but inverted love, and the intensity of love and hatred
   depends on the strength of affection and the ardor of temper.

   With all the suddenness and radicalness of the transformation there is
   nevertheless a bond of unity between Saul the Pharisee and Paul the
   Christian. It was the same person with the same end in view, but in
   opposite directions. We must remember that he was not a worldly,
   indifferent, cold-blooded man, but an intensely religious man. While
   persecuting the church, he was "blameless" as touching the
   righteousness of the law. [373] He resembled the rich youth who had
   observed the commandments, yet lacked the one things needful, and of
   whom Mark says that Jesus "loved him." [374] He was not converted from
   infidelity to faith, but from a lower faith to a purer faith, from the
   religion of Moses to the religion of Christ, from the theology of the
   law to the theology of the gospel. How shall a sinner be justified
   before the tribunal of a holy God? That was with him the question of
   questions before as well as after his conversion; not a scholastic
   question merely, but even far more a moral and religious question. For
   righteousness, to the Hebrew mind, is conformity to the will of God as
   expressed in his revealed law, and implies life eternal as its reward.
   The honest and earnest pursuit of righteousness is the connecting link
   between the two periods of Paul's life. First he labored to secure it
   by works of the law, then obedience of faith. What he had sought in
   vain by his fanatical zeal for the traditions of Judaism, he found
   gratuitously and at once by trust in the cross of Christ: pardon and
   peace with God. By the discipline of the Mosaic law as a tutor he was
   led beyond its restraints and prepared for manhood and freedom. Through
   the law he died to the law that he might live unto God. His old self,
   with its lusts, was crucified with Christ, so that henceforth he lived
   no longer himself, but Christ lived in him. [375] He was mystically
   identified with his Saviour and had no separate existence from him. The
   whole of Christianity, the whole of life, was summed up to him in the
   one word: Christ. He determined to know nothing save Jesus Christ and
   Him crucified for our sins, and risen again for our justification.
   [376]

   His experience of justification by faith, his free pardon and
   acceptance by Christ were to him the strongest stimulus to gratitude
   and consecration. His great sin of persecution, like Peter's denial,
   was overruled for his own good: the remembrance of it kept him humble,
   guarded him against temptation, and intensified his zeal and devotion.
   "I am the least of the apostles," he said in unfeigned humility that am
   not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of
   God. But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was
   bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than
   they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." [377]
   This confession contains, in epitome, the whole meaning of his life and
   work.

   The idea of justification by the free grace of God in Christ through a
   living faith which makes Christ and his merits our own and leads to
   consecration and holiness, is the central idea of Paul's Epistles. His
   whole theology, doctrinal, ethical, and practical, lies, like a germ,
   in his conversion; but it was actually developed by a sharp conflict
   with Judaizing teachers who continued to trust in the law for
   righteousness and salvation, and thus virtually frustrated the grace of
   God and made Christ's death unnecessary and fruitless.

   Although Paul broke radically with Judaism and opposed the Pharisaical
   notion of legal righteousness at every step and with all his might, he
   was far from opposing the Old Testament or the Jewish people. Herein he
   shows his great wisdom and moderation, and his infinite superiority
   over Marcion and other ultra- and pseudo-Pauline reformers. He now
   expounded the Scriptures as a direct preparation for the gospel, the
   law as a schoolmaster leading to Christ, Abraham as the father of the
   faithful. And as to his countrymen after the flesh, he loved them more
   than ever before. Filled with the amazing love of Christ who had
   pardoned him, "the chief of sinners," he was ready for the greatest
   possible sacrifice if thereby he might save them. His startling
   language in the ninth chapter of the Romans is not rhetorical
   exaggeration, but the genuine expression of that heroic self-denial and
   devotion which animated Moses, and which culminated in the sacrifice of
   the eternal Son of God on the cross of Calvary. [378]

   Paul's conversion was at the same time his call to the apostleship, not
   indeed to a place among the Twelve (for the vacancy of Judas was
   filled), but to the independent apostleship of the Gentiles. [379] Then
   followed an uninterrupted activity of more than a quarter of a century,
   which for interest and for permanent and ever-growing usefulness has no
   parallel in the annals of history, and affords an unanswerable proof of
   the sincerity of his conversion and the truth of Christianity. [380]

   Analogous Conversions.

   God deals with men according to their peculiar character and condition.
   As in Elijah's vision on Mount Horeb, God appears now in the mighty
   rushing wind that uproots the trees, now in the earthquake that rends
   the rocks, now in the consuming fire, now in the still small voice.
   Some are suddenly converted, and can remember the place and hour;
   others are gradually and imperceptibly changed in spirit and conduct;
   still others grow up unconsciously in the Christian faith from the
   mother's knee and the baptismal font. The stronger the will the more
   force it requires to overcome the resistance, and the more thorough and
   lasting is the change. Of all sudden and radical conversions that of
   Saul was the most sudden and the most radical. In several respects it
   stands quite alone, as the man himself and his work. Yet there are
   faint analogies in history. The divines who most sympathized with his
   spirit and system of doctrine, passed through a similar experience, and
   were much aided by his example and writings. Among these Augustin,
   Calvin, and Luther are the most conspicuous.

   St. Augustin, the son of a pious mother and a heathen father, was led
   astray into error and vice and wandered for years through the labyrinth
   of heresy and scepticism, but his heart was restless and homesick after
   God. At last, when he attained to the thirty-third year of his life
   (Sept., 386), the fermentation of his soul culminated in a garden near
   Milan, far away from his African home, when the Spirit of God, through
   the combined agencies of the unceasing prayers of Monica, the sermons
   of Ambrose, the example of St. Anthony, the study of Cicero and Plato,
   of Isaiah and Paul, brought about a change not indeed as wonderful--for
   no visible appearance of Christ was vouchsafed to him--but as sincere
   and lasting as that of the apostle. As he was lying in the dust of
   repentance and wrestling with God in prayer for deliverance, be
   suddenly heard a sweet voice as from heaven, calling out again and
   again: 'Take and read, take and read!" He opened the holy book and read
   the exhortation of Paul: "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
   provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." It was a voice
   of God; he obeyed it, he completely changed his course of life, and
   became the greatest and most useful teacher of his age.

   Of Calvin's conversion we know very little, but he himself
   characterizes it as a sudden change (subita conversio) from papal
   superstition to the evangelical faith. In this respect it resembles
   that of Paul rather than Augustin. He was no sceptic, no heretic, no
   immoral man, but as far as we know, a pious Romanist until the brighter
   life of the Reformation burst on his mind from the Holy Scriptures and
   showed him a more excellent way. "Only one haven of salvation is left
   for our souls," he says, "and that is the mercy of God in Christ. We
   are saved by grace--not by our merits, not by our works." He consulted
   not with flesh and blood, and burned the bridge after him. He renounced
   all prospects of a brilliant career, and exposed himself to the danger
   of persecution and death. He exhorted and strengthened the timid
   Protestants of France, usually closing with the words of Paul If God be
   for us, who can be against us?" He prepared in Paris a flaming address
   on reform, which was ordered to be burned; he escaped from persecution
   in a basket from a window, like Paul at Damascus, and wandered for two
   years as a fugitive evangelist from place to place until he found his
   sphere of labor in Geneva. With his conversion was born his Pauline
   theology, which sprang from his brain like Minerva from the head of
   Jupiter. Paul never had a more logical and theological commentator than
   John Calvin. [381]

   But the most Paul-like man in history is the leader of the German
   Reformation, who combined in almost equal proportion depth of mind,
   strength of will, tenderness of heart, and a fiery vehemence of temper,
   and was the most powerful herald of evangelical freedom; though
   inferior to Augustin and Calvin (not to say Paul) in self-discipline,
   consistency, and symmetry of character. [382] Luther's commentary on
   the Epistle to the Galatians, though not a grammatical or logical
   exposition, is a fresh reproduction and republication of the Epistle
   against the self-righteousness, and bondage of the papacy. Luther's
   first conversion took place in his twenty-first year (1505), when, as a
   student of law at Erfurt, on his return from a visit to his parents, he
   was so frightened by a fearful thunder-storm and flashes of lightning
   that he exclaimed: "Help, dear St. Anna, I will become a monk!" But
   that conversion, although it has often been compared with that of the
   apostle, had nothing to do with his Paulinism and Protestantism; it
   made him a pious Catholic, it induced him to flee from the world to the
   retreat of a convent for the salvation of his soul. And he became one
   of the most humble, obedient, and self-denying of monks, as Paul was
   one of the most earnest and zealous of Pharisees. "If ever a monk got
   to heaven by monkery," says Luther, "I ought to have gotten there." But
   the more he sought righteousness and peace by ascetic self denial and
   penal exercises, the more painfully he felt the weight of sin and the
   wrath of God, although unable to mention to his confessor any
   particular transgression. The discipline of the law drove him to the
   brink of despair, when by the kind interposition of Staupitz he was
   directed away from himself to the cross of Christ, as the only source
   of pardon and peace, and found, by implicit faith in His all-sufficient
   merits, that righteousness which he had vainly sought in his own
   strength. [383] This, his second conversion, as we may call it, which
   occurred several years later (1508), and gradually rather than
   suddenly, made him an evangelical freeman in Christ and prepared him
   for the great conflict with Romanism, which began in earnest with the
   nailing of the ninety-nine theses against the traffic in indulgences
   (1517). The intervening years may be compared to Paul's sojourn in
   Arabia and the subordinate labors preceding his first great missionary
   tour.

   False Explanations.

   Various attempts have been made by ancient heretics and modern
   rationalists to explain Paul's conversion in a purely natural way, but
   they have utterly failed, and by their failure they indirectly confirm
   the true view as given by the apostle himself and as held in all ages
   by the Christian church. [384]

   1. The Theory of Fraud.--The heretical and malignant faction of the
   Judaizers was disposed to attribute Paul's conversion to selfish
   motives, or to the influence of evil spirits.

   The Ebionites spread the lie that Paul was of heathen parents, fell in
   love with the daughter of the high priest in Jerusalem, became a
   proselyte and submitted to circumcision in order to secure her, but
   failing in his purpose, he took revenge and attacked the circumcision,
   the sabbath, and the whole Mosaic law. [385]

   In the pseudo-Clementine Homilies, which represent a speculative form
   of the Judaizing heresy, Paul is assailed under the disguise of Simon
   Magus, the arch-heretic, who struggled antinomian heathenism into the
   church. The manifestation of Christ was either a manifestation of his
   wrath, or a deliberate lie. [386]

   2. The Rationalistic Theory of Thunder and Lightning.--It attributes
   the conversion to physical causes, namely, a violent storm and the
   delirium of a burning Syrian fever, in which Paul superstitiously
   mistook the thunder for the voice of God and the lightning for a
   heavenly vision. [387] But the record says nothing about thunderstorm
   and fever, and both combined could not produce such an effect upon any
   sensible man, much less upon the history of the world. Who ever heard
   the thunder speak in Hebrew or in any other articulate language? And
   had not Paul and Luke eyes and ears and common sense, as well as we, to
   distinguish an ordinary phenomenon of nature from a supernatural
   vision?

   3. The Vision-Hypothesis resolves the conversion into a natural
   psychological process and into an honest self-delusion. It is the
   favorite theory of modern rationalists, who scorn all other
   explanations, and profess the highest respect for the intellectual and
   moral purity and greatness of Paul. [388] It is certainly more rational
   and creditable than the second hypothesis, because it ascribes the
   mighty change not to outward and accidental phenomena which pass away,
   but to internal causes. It assumes that an intellectual and moral
   fermentation was going on for some time in the mind of Paul, and
   resulted at last, by logical necessity, in an entire change of
   conviction and conduct, without any supernatural influence, the very
   possibility of which is denied as being inconsistent with the
   continuity of natural development. The miracle in this case was simply
   the mythical and symbolical reflection of the commanding presence of
   Jesus in the thoughts of the apostle.

   That Paul saw a vision, he says himself, but he meant, of course, a
   real, objective, personal appearance of Christ from heaven, which was
   visible to his eyes and audible to his ears, and at the same time a
   revelation to his mind through the medium of the senses. [389] The
   inner spiritual manifestation [390] was more important than the
   external, but both combined produced conviction. The vision-theory
   turns the appearance of Christ into a purely subjective imagination,
   which the apostle mistook for an objective fact. [391]

   It is incredible that a man of sound, clear, and keen mind as that of
   Paul undoubtedly was, should have made such a radical and far reaching
   blunder as to confound subjective reflections with an objective
   appearance of Jesus whom he persecuted, and to ascribe solely to an act
   of divine mercy what he must have known to be the result of his own
   thoughts, if he thought at all.

   The advocates of this theory throw the appearances of the risen Lord to
   the older disciples, the later visions of Peter, Philip, and John in
   the Apocalypse, into the same category of subjective illusions in the
   high tide of nervous excitement and religious enthusiasm. It is
   plausibly maintained that Paul was an enthusiast, fond of visions and
   revelations, [392] and that he justifies a doubt concerning the
   realness of the resurrection itself by putting all the appearances of
   the risen Christ on the same level with his own, although several years
   elapsed between those of Jerusalem and Galilee, and that on the way to
   Damascus.

   But this, the only possible argument for the vision-hypothesis, is
   entirely untenable. When Paul says: "Last of all, as unto an untimely
   offspring, Christ appeared to me also," he draws a clear line of
   distinction between the personal appearances of Christ and his own
   later visions, and closes the former with the one vouchsafed to him at
   his conversion. [393] Once, and once only, he claims to have seen the
   Lord in visible form and to have heard his voice; last, indeed, and out
   of due time, yet as truly and really as the older apostles. The only
   difference is that they saw the risen Saviour still abiding on earth,
   while he saw the ascended Saviour coming down from heaven, as we may
   expect him to appear to all men on the last day. It is the greatness of
   that vision which leads him to dwell on his personal unworthiness as
   "the least of the apostles and not worthy to be called an apostle,
   because he persecuted the church of God." He uses the realness of
   Christ's resurrection as the basis for his wonderful discussion of the
   future resurrection of believers, which would lose all its force if
   Christ had not actually been raised from the dead. [394]

   Moreover his conversion coincided with his call to the apostleship. If
   the former was a delusion, the latter must also have been a delusion.
   He emphasizes his direct call to the apostleship of the Gentiles by the
   personal appearance of Christ without any human intervention, in
   opposition to his Judaizing adversaries who tried to undermine his
   authority. [395]

   The whole assumption of a long and deep inward preparation, both
   intellectual and moral, for a change, is without any evidence, and
   cannot set aside the fact that Paul was, according to his repeated
   confession, at that time violently persecuting Christianity in its
   followers. His conversion can be far less explained from antecedent
   causes, surrounding circumstances, and personal motives than that of
   any other disciple. While the older apostles were devoted friends of
   Jesus, Paul was his enemy, bent at the very time of the great change on
   an errand of cruel persecution, and therefore in a state of mind most
   unlikely to give birth to a vision so fatal to his present object and
   his future career. How could a fanatical persecutor of Christianity,
   "breathing threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the
   Lord," stultify and contradict himself by an imaginative conceit which
   tended to the building up of that very religion which he was laboring
   to destroy! [396]

   But supposing (with Renan) that his mind was temporarily upset in the
   delirium of feverish excitement, he certainly soon recovered health and
   reason, and had every opportunity to correct his error; he was intimate
   with the murderers of Jesus, who could have produced tangible evidence
   against the resurrection if it had never occurred; and after a long
   pause of quiet reflection he went to Jerusalem, spent a fortnight with
   Peter, and could learn from him and from James, the brother of Christ,
   their experience, and compare it with his own. Everything in this case
   is against the mythical and legendary theory which requires a change of
   environment and the lapse of years for the formation of poetic fancies
   and fictions.

   Finally, the whole life-work of Paul, from his conversion at Damascus
   to his martyrdom in Rome, is the best possible argument against this
   hypothesis and for the realness of his conversion, as an act of divine
   grace. "By their fruits ye shall know them." How could such an
   effective change proceed from an empty dream? Can an illusion change
   the current of history? By joining the Christian sect Paul sacrificed
   everything, at last life itself, to the service of Christ. He never
   wavered in his conviction of the truth as revealed to him, and by his
   faith in this revelation he has become a benediction to all ages.

   The vision-hypothesis denies objective miracles, but ascribes miracles
   to subjective imaginations, and makes a he more effect ive and
   beneficial than the truth.

   All rationalistic and natural interpretations of the conversion of Paul
   turn out to be irrational and unnatural; the supernatural
   interpretation of Paul himself, after all, is the most rational and
   natural.

   Remarkable Concessions.

   Dr. Baur, the master-spirit of skeptical criticism and the founder of
   the "Tübingen School," felt constrained, shortly before his death
   (1860), to abandon the vision-hypothesis and to admit that "no
   psychological or dialectical analysis can explore the inner mystery of
   the act in which God revealed his Son in Paul (keine, weder
   psychologische noch dialektische Analyse kann das innere Geheimniss des
   Actes erforschen, in welchem Gott seinen Sohn in ihm enthülte). In the
   same connection he says that in, "the sudden transformation of Paul
   from the most violent adversary of Christianity into its most
   determined herald" he could see "nothing short of a miracle (Wunder);"
   and adds that "this miracle appears all the greater when we remember
   that in this revulsion of his consciousness he broke through the
   barriers of Judaism and rose out of its particularism into the
   universalism of Christianity." [397] This frank confession is
   creditable to the head and heart of the late Tübingen critic, but is
   fatal to his whole anti-supernaturalistic theory of history. Si falsus
   in uno, falsus in omnibus. If we admit the miracle in one case, the
   door is opened for all other miracles which rest on equally strong
   evidence.

   The late Dr. Keim, an independent pupil of Baur, admits at least
   spiritual manifestations of the ascended Christ from heaven, and urges
   in favor of the objective reality of the Christophanies as reported by
   Paul, 1 Cor. 15:3 sqq., "the whole character of Paul, his sharp
   understanding which was not weakened by his enthusiasm, the careful,
   cautious, measured, simple form of his statement, above all the
   favorable total impression of his narrative and the mighty echo of it
   in the unanimous, uncontradicted faith of primitive Christendom." [398]

   Dr. Schenkel, of Heidelberg, in his latest stage of development, says
   that Paul, with full justice, put his Christophany on a par with the
   Christophanies of the older apostles; that all these Christophanies are
   not simply the result of psychological processes, but "remain in many
   respects psychologically inconceivable," and point back to the historic
   background of the person of Jesus; that Paul was not an ordinary
   visionary, but carefully distinguished the Christophany at Damascus
   from his later visions; that he retained the full possession of his
   rational mind even in the moments of the highest exaltation; that his
   conversion was not the sudden effect of nervous excitement, but brought
   about by the influence of the divine Providence which quietly prepared
   his soul for the reception of Christ; and that the appearance of Christ
   vouchsafed to him was "no dream, but reality." [399]

   Professor Reuss, of Strasburg, likewise an independent critic of the
   liberal school, comes to the same conclusion as Baur, that the
   conversion of Paul, if not an absolute miracle, is at least an unsolved
   psychological problem. He says: "La conversion de Paul, après tout ce
   qui en a été dit de notre temps, reste toujours, si ce n'est un miracle
   absolu, dans le sens traditionnel de ce mot (c'est-à-dire un événement
   qui arrête ou change violemment le cours naturel des choses, un effet
   sans autre cause que l'intervention arbitraire et immédiate de Dieu),
   du moins un problème psychologique aujourd'hui insoluble. L'explication
   dite naturelle, qu'elle fasse intervenir un orage on qu'elle se
   retranche dans le domaine des hallucinations ... ne nous donne pas la
   clef de cette crise elle-même, qui a décidé la métamorphose du
   pharisien en chrétien " [400]

   Canon Farrar says (I. 195): "One fact remains upon any hypothesis and
   that is, that the conversion of St. Paul was in the highest sense of
   the word a miracle, and one of which the spiritual consequences have
   affected every subsequent age of the history of mankind."

   under apologetic conditions, and bring out each some interesting
   feature called forth by the occasion. This has been well shown by Dean
   Howson in Excursus C on Acts 26, in his and Canon Spence's Commentary
   on Acts. The discrepancies of the accounts are easily reconciled. They
   refer chiefly to the effect upon the companions of Paul who saw the
   light, but not the person of Christ, and heard a voice, but could not
   understand the words. The vision was not for them any more than the
   appearance of the risen Lord was for the soldiers who watched the
   grave. They were probably members of the Levitical temple guard, who
   were to bind and drag the Christian prisoners to Jerusalem.

   only increases his pain. Resistance is possible, but worse than
   useless.

   progress of the human heart to Christ from the heathen state of carnal
   security, when sin is dead because unknown, through the Jewish state of
   legal conflict, when sin, roused by the stimulus of the divine command,
   springs into life, and the higher and nobler nature of man strives in
   vain to overcome this fearful monster, until at last the free grace of
   God in Christ gains the victory. Some of the profoundest
   divines-Augustin, Luther, Calvin-transfer this conflict into the
   regenerate state; but this is described in the eighth chapter which

   [379] Paul never numbers himself with the Twelve. He distinguishes
   himself from the apostles of the circumcision, as the apostle of the
   uncircumcision, but of equal authority with them. Gal. 2:7-9. We have
   no intimation that the election of Matthias (Acts 1:26) was a mistake
   of the hasty Peter; it was ratified by the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit immediately following.

   [380] On the testimony of Paul to Christianity see above § 22. I will
   add some good remarks of Farrar, I. 202: "It is impossible," he says,
   "to exaggerate the importance of St. Paul's conversion as one of the
   evidences of Christianity .... To what does he testify respecting
   Jesus? To almost every single primary important fact respecting his
   incarnation, life, sufferings, betrayal, last supper, trial,
   crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and heavenly exaltation .... The
   events on which the apostle relied in proof of Christ's divinity, had
   taken place in the full blaze of contemporary knowledge. He had not to
   deal with uncertainties of criticism or assaults on authenticity. He
   could question, not ancient documents, but living men; he could
   analyze, not fragmentary records, but existing evidence. He had
   thousands of means close at hand whereby to test the reality or
   unreality of the Resurrection in which, up to this time, he had so
   passionately and contemptuously disbelieved. In accepting this
   half-crushed and wholly execrated faith he had everything in the world
   to lose-he had nothing conceivable to gain; and yet, in spite of
   all-overwhelmed by a conviction he felt to be irresistible--Saul, the
   Pharisee, became a witness of the resurrection, a preacher of the
   cross."

   [381] See my History of the Creeds of Christendom, I. 426 sqq.

   [382] This is fully recognized by Renan, who, however, has little
   sympathy either with the apostle or the reformer, and fancies that the
   theology of both is antiquated. "That historical character," he says,
   "which upon the whole bears most analogy to St. Paul, is Luther. In
   both there is the same violence in language, the same passion, the same
   energy, the same noble independence, the same frantic attachment to a
   thesis embraced as the absolute truth." St. Paul, ch. XXII. at the
   close. And his last note in this book is this: "The work which
   resembles most in spirit the Epistle to the Galatians is Luther's De
   Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae."

   [385] Reported by Epiphanius, Haer XXX. 16 (ed. Oehler, tom. I. 268
   sq.).

   [386] In the Clem. Hom., XVII., ch. 19 (p. 351, ed. Dressel), Simon
   Peter says to Simon Magus: "If, then, our Jesus appeared to you in a
   vision (di horamatos hophtheis made himself known to you, and conversed
   with you, it is as one who is enraged with an adversary (hos
   antikeimeno orgizomenos). And this is the reason why it was through
   visions and dreams (di horamaton kai enupnion), or through revelations
   that, were from without (e kai di apokalupseon ezothen ouson) that He
   spoke to you. But can any one be rendered fit for instruction through
   apparitions? (di otasian) .... And how are we to believe your word,
   when you tell us that He appeared to you? And how did He appear to you,
   when you entertain opinions contrary to His teaching? But if you have
   seen and were taught by Him, and became His apostle for a single hour,
   proclaim His utterances, interpret His sayings, love His apostles,
   contend not with me who companied with Him. For you stand now in direct
   opposition to me, who am a firm rock, the foundation of the church
   (sterean petran, themelion ekklesias, comp. Matt. 16:18). If you were
   not opposed to me, you would not accuse me, and revile the truth
   proclaimed by me, in order that I may not be believed when I state what
   I myself have heard with my own ears from the Lord, as if I were
   evidently a person that was condemned and had not stood the test
   [according to the true reading restored by Lagarde, adokimou ontos
   instead of eudokimountos,'in good repute']. But if you say that I am
   'condemned' (ei kategnosmenon me legeis, comp. Gal. 2:11), you bring an
   accusation against God, who revealed the Christ to me, and you inveigh
   against Him who pronounced me blessed on account of the revelation
   (Matt. 16:17). But if you really wish to be a co-worker, in the cause
   of truth, learn first of all from us what we have learned from Him,
   and, becoming a disciple of the truth, become a fellow-worker with me."
   The allusions to Paul's Christ-vision and his collision with Peter at
   Antioch are unmistakable, and form the chief argument for Baur's
   identification of Simon Magus with Paul. But it is perhaps only an
   incidental sneer. Simon represents all anti-Jewish heresies, as Peter
   represents all truths.

   [387] This theory was proposed by the so-called "vulgar" or deistic
   rationalists (as distinct from the more recent speculative or
   pantheistic rationalists), and has been revived and rhetorically
   embellished by Renan in Les Apôtres (ch. X., pp. 175 sqq.). "Every step
   to Damascus," says the distinguished French Academicien, "excited in
   Paul bitter repentance; the shameful task of the hangman was
   intolerable to him; he felt as if he was kicking against the goads; the
   fatigue of travel added to his depression; a malignant fever suddenly
   seized him; the blood rushed to the head; the mind was filled with a
   picture of midnight darkness broken by lightning flashes; it is
   probable that one of those sudden storms of Mount Hermon broke out
   which are unequalled for vehemence, and to the Jew the thunder was the
   voice of God, the lightning the fire of God. Certain it is that by a
   fearful stroke the persecutor was thrown on the ground and deprived of
   his senses; in his feverish delirium he mistook the lightning for a
   heavenly vision, the voice of thunder for a voice from heaven; inflamed
   eyes, the beginning of ophthalmia, aided the delusion. Vehement natures
   suddenly pass from one extreme to another; moments decide for the whole
   life; dogmatism is the only thing which remains. So Paul changed the
   object of his fanaticism; by his boldness, his energy, his
   determination he saved Christianity, which otherwise would have died
   like Essenism, without leaving a trace of its memory. He is the founder
   of independent Protestantism. He represents le christianisme conquérant
   et voyageur. Jesus never dreamed of such disciples; yet it is they who
   will keep his work alive and secure it eternity." In this work, and
   more fully in his St. Paul, Renan gives a picture of the great apostle
   which is as strange a mixture of truth and error, and nearly as
   incoherent and fanciful, as his romance of Jesus in the Vie de Jésus.

   [388] So Strauss (Leben Jesu, § 138, in connection with the
   resurrection of Christ), Baur (with much more seriousness and force, in
   his Paul, P. I., ch. 3) and the whole Tübingen School, Holsten,
   Hilgenfeld, Lipsius, Pfleiderer, Hausrath, and the author of
   Supernatural Religion (III. 498 sqq.). Baur at last gave up the theory
   as a failure (1860, see below). But Holsten revived and defended it
   very elaborately and ingeniously in his essay on the Christusvision des
   Paulus, in Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift" for 1861. W. Beyschlag (of Halle)
   very ably refuted it in an article: Die Bekehrung des Paulus mit
   besonderer Rücksicht auf die Erklärungsversuche von Baur und Holsten,
   in the "Studien und Kritiken" for 1864, pp. 197-264. Then Holsten came
   out with an enlarged edition of his essay in book form, Zum Evang. des
   Paulus und des Petrus, 1868, with a long reply to Beyschlag. Pfleiderer
   repeated the vision-theory in his Hibbert Lectures (1885). Some English
   writers have also written on Paul's conversion in opposition to this
   modern vision-theory, namely, R. Macpherson: The Ressurection of Jesus
   Christ (against Strauss), Edinb., 1867, Lect. XIII., pp. 316-360; Geo.
   P. Fisher: Supernatural Origin of Christianity, N. York, new ed. 1877,
   pp. 459-470, comp. his essay on "St. Paul" in Discussions in History
   and Theology, N.Y. 1880, pp. 487-511; A. B. Bruce (of Glasgow): Paul's
   Conversion and the Pauline Gospel, in the "Presbyt Review" for Oct.
   1880 (against Pfleiderer, whose work on Paulinism Bruce calls "an
   exegetical justification and a philosophical dissipation of the
   Reformed interpretation of the Pauline system of doctrine").

   [389] He describes it as an ouranios optasia Acts 26:19, and says that
   he saw Christ, that Christ was seen by him, 1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8. So the
   vision of the women at the tomb of the risen Lord is called an optasia
   ton angelon, Luke 24:23. But even Peter, who was less critical than
   Paul, well knew how to distinguish between an actual occurrence (an
   alethos genomenon) and a merely subjective vision (a horama) Acts 12:9.
   Objective visions are divine revelations through the senses; subjective
   visions are hallucinations and deceptions.

   [390] Gal. 1:16, apokalupsai ton huion autou en emoi, within me, in my
   inmost soul and consciousness.

   [391] Baur was disposed to charge this confusion upon the author of the
   Acts and to claim for Paul a more correct conception of the
   Christophany, as being a purely inner event or "a spiritual
   manifestation of Christ to his deeper self-consciousness" (Gal. 1:16,
   en emoi); but this is inconsistent with Paul's own language in 1 Cor.
   9:1; 15:8. Holsten admits that, without a full conviction of the
   objective, reality of the Christophany, Paul could never have come to
   the conclusion that the crucified was raised to new life by the
   almighty power of God. He states the case from his standpoint clearly
   in these words (p. 65): "Der glaube des Paulus an Jesus als den
   Christus war folge dessen, dass auch ihm Christus erschienen war, (1
   Cor. 15:8).Diese vision war für das bewusstsein des Paulus das schauen
   einer objectiv-wirklichen, himmlischen gestalt, die aus ihrer
   transcendenten unsichtbarkeit sich ihm zur erscheinung gebracht habe.
   Aus der wirklichkeit dieser gesehauten gestalt, in welcher er den
   gekreuzigtenJesus erkannte, folgerte auch er, dass der kreuzestote zu
   neuem leben von der allmacht Gottes auferweckt worden, aus der
   gewissheit der auferweckung aber, dass dieser von den toten auferweckte
   der sohn Gottes und der Messias sei. Wie also an der wirklichkeit der
   auferweckung dem Paulus die ganze wahrheit seines evangelium hängt
   (vgl. 1 Cor. 15, 12 f.), so ist es die, vision des auferweckten, mit
   welcher ihm die wahrheit des messias-glaubens aufging, und der
   umschwung seines bewusstseins sich vollendete. "Diese vision war für
   Paulus der eingriff einer fremden transcendenten macht in sein
   geistesleben. Die historische kritik aber unter der herrschaft des
   gesetzes der immanenten entwicklung des menschlichen geistes aus
   innerweltlichen causalitäten muss die vision als einen immanenten,
   psychogischen akt seines eigenen geistes zu begreifen suchen. Ihr liegt
   damit eine ihrer schwiezigsten aufgaben vor, eine so schwierige, dass
   ein meister der historischen kritik, der zugleich so tief in das wesen
   des paulinischen geistes eingedrungen ist, als Baur, noch eben erklärt
   hat, dass 'keine, weder psychologische, noch dialektische analyse das
   innere geheimnis des aktes erforschen könne, in welchem Gott seinen
   sohn dem Paulus enthüllte.'Und doch darf sich die kritik von dem
   versuch, dies geheimnis zu erforschen, nicht abschrecken, lassen. Denn
   diese vision ist einer der entscheidendsten punkte für ein
   geschichtliches begreifen des urchristentums. In ihrer genesis ist der
   keim des paulinischen evangelium gegeben. So lange der schein nicht
   aufgehoben ist, dass die empfängnis dieses keims als die wirkung einer
   transcendenten kraft erfolgt sei, besteht über dem empfangenen fort und
   fort der schein des transcendenten. Und die kritik am wenigsten darf
   sich damit beruhigen, dass eine transcendenz, eine objectivität, wie
   sie von ihren gegnern für diese vision gefordert wird, von der
   selbstgewissheit des modernen geistes verworfen sei. Denn diese
   selbstgewissheit kann ihre wahrheit nur behaupten, solange und soweit
   ihre kategorieen als das gesetz der wirklichkeit nachgewiesen sind."Dr.
   Pfleiderer moves in the same line with Holsten, and eliminates the
   supernatural, but it is due to him to say that he admits the purely
   hypothetical character of this speculative theory, and lays great
   stress on the moral as well as the logical and dialectical process in
   Paul's mind, "Darum war,"he says (Paulinismus, p. 16)."der Prozess der
   Bekehrung nichts weniger, als eine kalte Denkoperation; es war vielmehr
   der tiefsittliche Gehorsamsakt eines zarten Gewissens gegen die sich
   unwiderstehlich aufdrängende höhere Wahrheit (daher ihm auch der Glaube
   eine hupakoeist), ein Akt grossartiger Selbstverleugnung, der Hingabe
   des alten Menschen und seiner ganzen religiösen Welt in den Tod, um
   fortan keinen Ruhm, ja kein Leben mehr zu haben, als in Christo, dem
   Gekreuzigten. Das ist ja der Grundton, den wir aus allen Briefen des
   Apostels heraustönen hören, wo immer er sein persönliches Verhältniss
   zum Kreuz Christi schildert; es ist nie bloss ein Verhältniss
   objectiver Theorie, sondern immer zugleich und wesentlich das der
   subjectiven Verbundenheit des innersten Gemüths mit dem Gekreuzigten,
   eine mystische Gemeinschaft mit dem Kreuzestod und mit dem
   Auferstehungsleben Christi."

   [392] Comp. 2 Cor. 12:2; Acts 18:9; 22:17. Some of these modern critics
   suppose that he was epileptic, like Mohammed and Swedenborg, and
   therefore all the more open to imaginary visions.

   [393] 1 Cor. 15:8: eschaton de panton, hosperei to ektromati, ophthe
   kamoi. Meyer justly remarks in loc.: eschatonschliesst die Reihe
   leibhaftiger Erscheinungen ab, und scheidet damit diese von späteren
   visionären oder sonst apokalyptischen."Similarly Godet (Com. sur
   l'épitre aux Romains, 1879, I. 17) "Paul clôt l'énumeration des
   apparitions de Jésus ressuscité aux apôtres par celle qui lui a été
   accordée à lui-méme; il lui attribue donc la méme réalité qu'à
   celles-là, et il la distingue ainsi d'une manière tranchée de toutes
   les visions dont il fut plus tard honoré et que mentionnent le livre
   des Actes, et les épitres."

   [394] 1 Cor 15:12 sqq. Dean Stanley compares this discussion to the
   Phaedo of Plato and the Tusculan Disputations of Cicero, but it is far
   more profound and assuring. Heathen philosophy can at best prove only
   the possibility and probability, but not the certainty, of a future
   life. Moreover the idea of immortality has no comfort, but terror
   rather, except for those who believe in Christ, who is "the
   Resurrection and the Life."

   § 32. The Work of Paul.


   "He who can part from country and from kin,

   And scorn delights, and tread the thorny way,

   A heavenly crown, through toil and pain, to win--

   He who reviled can tender love repay,

   And buffeted, for bitter foes can pray--

   He who, upspringing at his Captain's call,

   Fights the good fight, and when at last the day

   Of fiery trial comes, can nobly fall--

   Such were a saint--or more--and such the holy Paul!"

   --Anon.

   The conversion of Paul was a great intellectual and moral revolution,
   yet without destroying his identity. His noble gifts and attainments
   remained, but were purged of Selfish motives, inspired by a new
   principle, and consecrated to a divine end. The love of Christ who
   saved him, was now his all-absorbing passion, and no sacrifice was too
   great to manifest his gratitude to Him. The architect of ruin became an
   architect of the temple of God. The same vigor, depth and acuteness of
   mind, but illuminated by the Holy Spirit; the same strong temper and
   burning zeal, but cleansed, subdued and controlled by wisdom and
   moderation; the same energy and boldness, but coupled with gentleness
   and meekness; and, added to all this, as crowning gifts of grace, a
   love and humility, a tenderness and delicacy of feeling such as are
   rarely, if ever, found in a character so proud, manly and heroic. The
   little Epistle to Philemon reveals a perfect Christian gentleman, a
   nobleman of nature, doubly ennobled by grace. The thirteenth chapter of
   the first Epistle to the Corinthians could only be conceived by a mind
   that had ascended on the mystic ladder of faith to the throbbing heart
   of the God of love; yet without inspiration even Paul could not have
   penned that seraphic description of the virtue which beareth all
   things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,
   which never faileth, but will last for ever the greatest in the triad
   of celestial graces: faith, hope, love.

   Saul converted became at once Paul the missionary. Being saved himself,
   he made it his life-work to save others. "Straight way" he proclaimed
   Christ in the synagogues, and confounded the Jews of Damascus, proving
   that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of God. [401] But this
   was only a preparatory testimony in the fervor of the first love. The
   appearance of Christ, and the travails of his soul during the three
   days and nights of prayer and fasting, when he experienced nothing less
   than a spiritual death and a spiritual resurrection, had so shaken his
   physical and mental frame that he felt the need of protracted repose
   away from the noise and turmoil of the world. Besides there must have
   been great danger threatening his life as soon as the astounding news
   of his conversion became known at Jerusalem. He therefore went to the
   desert of Arabia and spent there three years, [402] not in missionary
   labor (as Chrysostom thought), but chiefly in prayer, meditation and
   the study of the Hebrew Scriptures in the light of their fulfilment
   through the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth. This retreat took the
   place of the three years' preparation of the Twelve in the school of
   Christ. Possibly he may have gone as far as Mount Sinai, among the wild
   children of Hagar and Ishmael. [403] On that pulpit of the great
   lawgiver of Israel, and in view of the surrounding panorama of death
   and desolation which reflects the terrible majesty of Jehovah, as no
   other spot on earth, he could listen with Elijah to the thunder and
   earthquake, and the still small voice, and could study the contrast
   between the killing letter and the life-giving spirit, between the
   ministration of death and the ministration of righteousness. [404] The
   desert, like the ocean, has its grandeur and sublimity, and leaves the
   meditating mind alone with God and eternity.

   "Paul was a unique man for a unique task." [405] His task was twofold:
   practical and theoretical. He preached the gospel of free and universal
   grace from Damascus to Rome, and secured its triumph in the Roman
   empire, which means the civilized world of that age. At the same time
   he built up the church from within by the exposition and defence of the
   gospel in his Epistles. He descended to the humblest details of
   ecclesiastical administration and discipline, and mounted to the
   sublimest heights of theological speculation. Here we have only to do
   with his missionary activity; leaving his theoretical work to be
   considered in another chapter.

   Let us first glance at his missionary spirit and policy.

   His inspiring motive was love to Christ and to his fellow-men. "The
   love of Christ," he says, "constraineth us; because we thus judge, that
   one died for all, therefore all died: and He died for all that they who
   live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their
   sakes died and rose again." He regarded himself as a bondman and
   ambassador of Christ, entreating men to be reconciled to God. Animated
   by this spirit, he became "as a Jew to the Jews, as a Gentile to the
   Gentiles, all things to all men that by all means he might save some."

   He made Antioch, the capital of Syria and the mother church of Gentile
   Christendom, his point of departure for, and return from, his
   missionary journeys, and at the same time he kept up his connection
   with Jerusalem, the mother church of Jewish Christendom. Although an
   independent apostle of Christ, he accepted a solemn commission from
   Antioch for his first great missionary tour. He followed the current of
   history, commerce, and civilization, from East to West, from Asia to
   Europe, from Syria to Asia Minor, Greece, Italy, and perhaps as far as
   Spain. [406] In the larger and more influential cities, Antioch,
   Ephesus, Corinth, Rome, he resided a considerable time. From these
   salient points he sent the gospel by his pupils and fellow-laborers
   into the surrounding towns and villages. But he always avoided
   collision with other apostles, and sought new fields of labor where
   Christ was not known before, that he might not build on any other man's
   foundation. This is true independence and missionary courtesy, which is
   so often, alas! violated by missionary societies inspired by sectarian
   rather than Christian zeal.

   His chief mission was to the Gentiles, without excluding the Jews,
   according to the message of Christ delivered through Ananias: "Thou
   shalt bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of
   Israel." Considering that the Jews had a prior claim in time to the
   gospel, [407] and that the synagogues in heathen cities were pioneer
   stations for Christian missions, he very naturally addressed himself
   first to the Jews and proselytes, taking up the regular lessons of the
   Old Testament Scriptures, and demonstrating their fulfilment in Jesus
   of Nazareth. But almost uniformly he found the half-Jews, or
   "proselytes of the gate," more open to the gospel than his own
   brethren; they were honest and earnest seekers of the true religion,
   and formed the natural bridge to the pure heathen, and the nucleus of
   his congregations, which were generally composed of converts from both
   religions.

   In noble self-denial he earned his subsistence with his own hands, as a
   tent-maker, that he might not be burthensome to his congregations
   (mostly belonging to the lower classes), that he might preserve his
   independence, stop the mouths of his enemies, and testify his gratitude
   to the infinite mercy of the Lord, who had called him from his
   headlong, fanatical career of persecution to the office of an apostle
   of free grace. He never collected money for himself, but for the poor
   Jewish Christians in Palestine. Only as an exception did he receive
   gifts from his converts at Philippi, who were peculiarly dear to him.
   Yet he repeatedly enjoins upon the churches to care for the liberal
   temporal support of their teachers who break to them the bread of
   eternal life. The Saviour of the world a carpenter! the greatest
   preacher of the gospel a tent-maker!

   Of the innumerable difficulties, dangers, and sufferings which he
   encountered with Jews, heathens, and false brethren, we can hardly form
   an adequate idea; for the book of Acts is only a summary record. He
   supplements it incidentally. "Of the Jews five times received I forty
   stripes save one. Three times was I beaten with rods, once was I
   stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been
   in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of
   robbers, in perils from my countrymen, in perils from the heathen, in
   perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,
   in perils among false brethren: in labor and toil, in watchings often,
   in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Besides
   those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me
   daily, the anxious care for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not
   weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?" [408] Thus he wrote reluctantly
   to the Corinthians, in self-vindication against his calumniators, in
   the year 57, before his longest and hardest trial in the prisons of
   Caesarea and Rome, and at least seven years before his martyrdom. He
   was "pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not in
   despair; pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed."
   [409] His whole public career was a continuous warfare. He represents
   the church militant, or "marching and conquering Christianity." He was
   "unus versus mundum," in a far higher sense than this has been said of
   Athanasius the Great when confronted with the Arian heresy and the
   imperial heathenism of Julian the Apostate.

   Yet he was never unhappy, but full of joy and peace. He exhorted the
   Philippians from his prison in Rome: "Rejoice in the Lord alway; again
   I will say, Rejoice." In all his conflicts with foes from without and
   foes from within Paul was "more than conqueror" through the grace of
   God which was sufficient for him. "For I am persuaded," he writes to
   the Romans in the strain of a sublime ode of triumph, "that neither
   death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present,
   nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord." [410] And his dying word is an assurance of
   victory: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I
   have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
   righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
   that day: and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved his
   appearing." [411]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [401] The eutheosof Acts 9:20 compels us to put this short testimony
   during the few days (hemeras tinas) which he spent with the disciples
   at Damascus, before his departure to Arabia. About three years
   afterwards (or after "many days,"hemerai hikanai, were fulfilled, Acts
   9:23), he returned to Damascus to renew his testimony (Gal. 1:17).

   [402] Gal. 1:17, 18. In the Acts (9:23) this journey is ignored because
   it belonged not to the public, but private and inner life of Paul.

   [403] Comp. Gal. 4:25, where "Arabia" means the Sinaitic Peninsula.

   [404] 2 Cor. 3:6-9.

   [405] Thus Godet sums up his life (Romans, Introd. I. 59). He thinks
   that Paul was neither the substitute of Judas, nor of James the son of
   Zebedee, but a substitute for a converted Israel, the man who had,
   single-handed, to execute the task which properly fell to his whole
   nation; and hence the hour of his call was precisely that when the
   blood of the two martyrs, Stephen and James, sealed the hardening of
   Israel and decided its rejection.

   [406] "Westward the course of empire takes its way." This famous line
   of Bishop Berkeley, the philosopher, express a general law of history
   both civil and religious. Clement of Rome says that Paul came on his
   missionary tour "to the extreme west" (epi to terma tes duseos), which
   means either Rome or Spain, whither the apostle intended to go (Rom.
   15:24, 28). Some English historians (Ussher, Stillingfleet, etc.) would
   extend Paul's travels to Gaul and Britain, but of this there is no
   trace either in the New Test., or in the early tradition. See below.

   [407] Rom. 1:16, "to the Jews first," not on the ground of a superior
   merit (the Jews, as a people, were most unworthy and ungrateful), but
   on the ground of God's promise and the historical order (Rom. 15:8).

   [408] 2 Cor. 11:24-29.

   [409] 2 Cor. 4:8, 9.

   [410] Rom. 8:31-39.

   [411] 2 Tim. 4:6-8. We may add here the somewhat panegyric passage of
   Clement of Rome, who apparently exalts Paul above Peter, Ep. ad
   Corinth. c. 5: "Let as set before our eyes the good Apostles. Peter,
   who on account of unrighteous jealousy endured not one or two, but many
   toils, and thus having borne his testimony (marturesas, or, suffered
   martyrdom), went to his appointed place of glory. By reason of jealousy
   and strife Paul by his example pointed out the price of patient
   endurance. After having been seven times in bonds, driven into exile,
   stoned, and after having preached in the East and in the West, he won
   the noble reward of his faith, having taught righteousness unto the
   whole world and having reached the boundary of the West; and when he
   had borne his testimony before the magistrates, he departed from the
   world and went unto the holy place, having become the greatest example
   of patient endurance."

   § 33. Paul's Missionary Labors.

   The public life of Paul, from the third year after his conversion to
   his martyrdom, a.d. 40-64, embraces a quarter of a century, three great
   missionary campaigns with minor expeditions, five visits to Jerusalem,
   and at least four years of captivity in Caesarea and Rome. Some extend
   it to a.d. 67 or 68. It may be divided into five or six periods, as
   follows:

   1. a.d. 40-44. The period of preparatory labors in Syria and his native
   Cilicia, partly alone, partly in connection with Barnabas, his senior
   fellow-apostle among the Gentiles.

   On his return from the Arabian retreat Paul began his public ministry
   in earnest at Damascus, preaching Christ on the very spot where he had
   been converted and called. His testimony enraged the Jews, who stirred
   up the deputy of the king of Arabia against him, but he was saved for
   future usefulness and let down by the brethren in a basket through a
   window in the wall of the city. [412] Three years after his conversion
   he went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter and spent a
   fortnight with him. Besides him he saw James the brother of the Lord.
   Barnabas introduced him to the disciples, who at first were afraid of
   him, but when they heard of his marvellous conversion they "glorified
   God" that their persecutor was now preaching the faith he had once been
   laboring to destroy. [413] He did not come to learn the gospel, having
   received it already by revelation, nor to be confirmed or ordained,
   having been called "not from men, or through man, but through Jesus
   Christ." Yet his interview with Peter and James, though barely
   mentioned, must have been fraught with the deepest interest. Peter,
   kind-hearted and generous as he was, would naturally receive him with
   joy and thanksgiving. He had himself once denied the Lord--not
   malignantly but from weakness--as Paul had persecuted the
   disciples--ignorantly in unbelief. Both had been mercifully pardoned,
   both had seen the Lord, both were called to the highest dignity, both
   could say from the bottom of the heart: "Lord thou knowest all things;
   thou knowest that I love thee." No doubt they would exchange their
   experiences and confirm each other in their common faith.

   It was probably on this visit that Paul received in a vision in the
   temple the express command of the Lord to go quickly unto the Gentiles.
   [414] Had he stayed longer at the seat of the Sanhedrin, he would
   undoubtedly have met the fate of the martyr Stephen.

   He visited Jerusalem a second time during the famine under Claudius, in
   the year 44, accompanied by Barnabas, on a benevolent mission, bearing
   a collection of the Christians at Antioch for the relief of the
   brethren in Judaea. [415] On that occasion he probably saw none of the
   apostles on account of the persecution in which James was beheaded, and
   Peter imprisoned.

   The greater part of these four years was spent in missionary work at
   Tarsus and Antioch.

   2. a.d. 45-50. First missionary journey. In the year 45 Paul entered
   upon the first great missionary journey, in company with Barnabas and
   Mark, by the direction of the Holy Spirit through the prophets of the
   congregation at Antioch. He traversed the island of Cyprus and several
   provinces of Asia Minor. The conversion of the Roman proconsul, Sergius
   Paulus, at Paphos; the rebuke and punishment of the Jewish sorcerer,
   Elymas; the marked success of the gospel in Pisidia, and the bitter
   opposition of the unbelieving Jews; the miraculous healing of a cripple
   at Lystra; the idolatrous worship there offered to Paul and Barnabas by
   the superstitious heathen, and its sudden change into hatred against
   them as enemies of the gods; the stoning of the missionaries, their
   escape from death, and their successful return to Antioch, are the
   leading incidents of this tour, which is fully described in Acts 13 and
   14.

   This period closes with the important apostolic conference at
   Jerusalem, a.d. 50, which will require separate consideration in the
   next section.

   3. From a.d. 51-54. Second missionary journey. After the council at
   Jerusalem and the temporary adjustment of the difference between the
   Jewish and Gentile branches of the church, Paul undertook, in the year
   51, a second great journey, which decided the Christianization of
   Greece. He took Silas for his companion. Having first visited his old
   churches, he proceeded, with the help of Silas and the young convert,
   Timothy, to establish new ones through the provinces of Phrygia and
   Galatia, where, notwithstanding his bodily infirmity, he was received
   with open arms like an angel of God.

   From Troas, a few miles south of the Homeric Troy and the entrance to
   the Hellespont, he crossed over to Greece in answer to the Macedonian
   cry: "Come over and help us!" He preached the gospel with great
   success, first in Philippi, where he converted the purple dealer,
   Lydia, and the jailor, and was imprisoned with Silas, but miraculously
   delivered and honorably released; then in Thessalonica, where he was
   persecuted by the Jews, but left a flourishing church; in Beraea, where
   the converts showed exemplary zeal in searching the Scriptures. In
   Athens, the metropolis of classical literature, he reasoned with Stoic
   and Epicurean philosophers, and unveiled to them on Mars' Hill
   (Areopagus), with consummate tact and wisdom, though without much
   immediate success, the "unknown God," to whom the Athenians, in their
   superstitious anxiety to do justice to all possible divinities, had
   unconsciously erected an altar, and Jesus Christ, through whom God will
   judge the world in righteousness. [416] In Corinth, the commercial
   bridge between the East and the West, a flourishing centre of wealth
   and culture, but also a sink of vice and corruption, the apostle spent
   eighteen months, and under almost insurmountable difficulties he built
   up a church, which exhibited all the virtues and all the faults of the
   Grecian character under the influence of the gospel, and which he
   honored with two of his most important Epistles. [417]

   In the spring of 54 he returned by way of Ephesus, Caesarea, and
   Jerusalem to Antioch.

   During this period he composed the two Epistles to the Thessalonians,
   which are the earliest of his literary remains excepting his missionary
   addresses preserved in the Acts.

   4. a.d. 54-58. Third missionary tour. Towards the close of the year 54
   Paul went to Ephesus, and in this renowned capital of proconsular Asia
   and of the worship of Diana, he fixed for three years the centre of his
   missionary work. He then revisited his churches in Macedonia and
   Achaia, and remained three months more in Corinth and the vicinity.

   During this period he wrote the great doctrinal Epistles to the
   Galatians, Corinthians, and Romans, which mark the height of his
   activity and usefulness.

   5. a.d. 58-63. The period of his two imprisonments, with the
   intervening winter voyage from Caesarea to Rome. In the spring of 58 he
   journeyed, for the fifth and last time, to Jerusalem, by way of
   Philippi, Troas, Miletus (where he delivered his affecting valedictory
   to the Ephesian presbyter-bishops), Tyre, and Caesarea, to carry again
   to the poor brethren in Judaea a contribution from the Christians of
   Greece, and by this token of gratitude and love to cement the two
   branches of the apostolic church more firmly together.

   But some fanatical Jews, who bitterly bated him as an apostate and a
   seducer of the people, raised an uproar against him at Pentecost;
   charged him with profaning the temple, because he had taken into it an
   uncircumcised Greek, Trophimus; dragged him out of the sanctuary, lest
   they should defile it with blood, and would undoubtedly have killed him
   had not Claudius Lysias, the Roman tribune, who lived near by, come
   promptly with his soldiers to the spot. This officer rescued Paul, out
   of respect for his Roman citizenship, from the fury of the mob, set him
   the next day before the Sanhedrin, and after a tumultuous and fruitless
   session of the council, and the discovery of a plot against his life,
   sent him, with a strong military guard and a certificate of innocence,
   to the procurator Felix in Caesarea.

   Here the apostle was confined two whole years (58-60), awaiting his
   trial before the Sanhedrin, uncondemned, occasionally speaking before
   Felix, apparently treated with comparative mildness, visited by the
   Christians, and in some way not known to us promoting the kingdom of
   God. [418]

   After the accession of the new and better procurator, Festus, who is
   known to have succeeded Felix in the year 60, Paul, as a Roman citizen,
   appealed to the tribunal of Caesar and thus opened the way to the
   fulfilment of his long-cherished desire to preach the Saviour of the
   world in the metropolis of the world. Having once more testified his
   innocence, and spoken for Christ in a masterly defence before Festus,
   King Herod Agrippa II. (the last of the Herods), his sister Bernice,
   and the most distinguished men of Caesarea, he was sent in the autumn
   of the year 60 to the emperor. He had a stormy voyage and suffered
   shipwreck, which detained him over winter at Malta. The voyage is
   described with singular minuteness and nautical accuracy by Luke as an
   eye-witness. In the month of March of the year 61, the apostle, with a
   few faithful companions, reached Rome, a prisoner of Christ, and yet
   freer and mightier than the emperor on the throne. It was the seventh
   year of Nero's reign, when he had already shown his infamous character
   by the murder of Agrippina, his mother, in the previous year, and other
   acts of cruelty.

   In Rome Paul spent at least two years till the spring of 63, in easy
   confinement, awaiting the decision of his case, and surrounded by
   friends and fellow-laborers "in his own hired dwelling." He preached
   the gospel to the soldiers of the imperial body-guard, who attended
   him; sent letters and messages to his distant churches in Asia Minor
   and Greece; watched over all their spiritual affairs, and completed in
   bonds his apostolic fidelity to the Lord and his church. [419]

   In the Roman prison he wrote the Epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians,
   Philippians, and Philemon.

   6. a.d. 63 and 64. With the second year of Paul's imprisonment in Rome
   the account of Luke breaks off, rather abruptly, yet appropriately and
   grandly. Paul's arrival in Rome secured the triumph of Christianity. In
   this sense it was true, "Roma locuta est, causa finita est." And he who
   spoke at Rome is not dead; he is still "preaching (everywhere) the
   kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus
   Christ, with all boldness, none forbidding him." [420]

   But what became of him after the termination of those two years in the
   spring of 63? What was the result of the trial so long delayed? Was he
   condemned to death? or was he released by Nero's tribunal, and thus
   permitted to labor for another season? This question is still unsettled
   among scholars. A vague tradition says that Paul was acquitted of the
   charge of the Sanhedrin, and after travelling again in the East,
   perhaps also into Spain, was a second time imprisoned in Rome and
   condemned to death. The assumption of a second Roman captivity relieves
   certain difficulties in the Pastoral Epistles; for they seem to require
   a short period of freedom between the first and a second Roman
   captivity, and a visit to the East, [421] which is not recorded in the
   Acts, but which the apostle contemplated in case of his release. [422]
   A visit to Spain, which he intended, is possible, though less probable.
   [423] If he was set at liberty, it must have been before the terrible
   persecution in July, 64, which would not have spared the great leader
   of the Christian sect. It is a remarkable coincidence that just about
   the close of the second year of Paul's confinement, the celebrated
   Jewish historian, Josephus, then in his 27th year, came to Rome (after
   a tempestuous voyage and shipwreck), and effected through the influence
   of Poppaea (the wife of Nero and a half proselyte of Judaism) the
   release of certain Jewish priests who had been sent to Rome by Felix as
   prisoners. [424] It is not impossible that Paul may have reaped the
   benefit of a general release of Jewish prisoners.

   The martyrdom of Paul under Nero is established by the unanimous
   testimony of antiquity. As a Roman citizen, he was not crucified, like
   Peter, but put to death by the sword. [425] The scene of his martyrdom
   is laid by tradition about three miles from Rome, near the Ostian way,
   on a green spot, formerly called Aquae Salviae, afterwards Tre Fontane,
   from the three fountains which are said to have miraculously gushed
   forth from the blood of the apostolic martyr. His relics were
   ultimately removed to the basilica of San Paolo-fuori-le-Mura, built by
   Theodosius and Valentinian in 388, and recently reconstructed. He lies
   outside of Rome, Peter inside. His memory is celebrated, together with
   that of Peter, on the 29th and 30th of June. [426] As to the year of
   his death, the views vary from a.d. 64 to 69. The difference of the
   place and manner of his martyrdom suggests that he was condemned by a
   regular judicial trial, either shortly before, or more probably a year
   or two after the horrible wholesale massacre of Christians on the
   Vatican hill, in which his Roman citizenship would not have been
   regarded. If he was released in the spring of 63, he had a year and a
   half for another visit to the East and to Spain before the outbreak of
   the Neronian persecution (after July, 64); but tradition favors a later
   date. Prudentius separates the martyrdom of Peter from that of Paul by
   one year. After that persecution the Christians were everywhere exposed
   to danger. [427]

   Assuming the release of Paul and another visit to the East, we must
   locate the First Epistle to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus between
   the first and second Roman captivity, and the Second Epistle to Timothy
   in the second captivity. The last was evidently written in the certain
   view of approaching martyrdom; it is the affectionate farewell of the
   aged apostle to his beloved Timothy, and his last will and testament to
   the militant church below in the bright prospect of the unfading crown
   in the church triumphant above. [428]

   Thus ended the earthly course of this great teacher of nations, this
   apostle of victorious faith, of evangelical freedom, of Christian
   progress. It was the heroic career of a spiritual conqueror of immortal
   souls for Christ, converting them from the service of sin and Satan to
   the service of the living God, from the bondage of the law to the
   freedom of the gospel, and leading them to the fountain of life
   eternal. He labored more abundantly than all the other apostles; and
   yet, in sincere humility, he considered himself "the least of the
   apostles," and "not meet to be called an apostle," because he
   persecuted the church of God; a few years later he confessed: "I am
   less than the least of all saints," and shortly before his death: "I am
   the chief of sinners." [429] His humility grew as he experienced God's
   mercy and ripened for heaven. Paul passed a stranger and pilgrim
   through this world, hardly observed by the mighty and the wise of his
   age. And yet how infinitely more noble, beneficial, and enduring was
   his life and work than the dazzling march of military conquerors, who,
   prompted by ambitions absorbed millions of treasure and myriads of
   lives, only to die at last in a drunken fit at Babylon, or of a broken
   heart on the rocks of St. Helena! Their empires have long since
   crumbled into dust, but St. Paul still remains one of the foremost
   benefactors of the human race, and the pulses of his mighty heart are
   beating with stronger force than ever throughout the Christian world.

   Note on the Second Roman Captivity of Paul.

   The question of a second Roman captivity of Paul is a purely historical
   and critical problem, and has no doctrinal or ethical bearing, except
   that it facilitates the defence of the genuineness of the Pastoral
   Epistles. The best scholars are still divided on the subject. Neander,
   Gieseler, Bleek, Ewald, Lange, Sabatier, Godet, also Renan (Saint Paul,
   p. 560, and L'Antechrist, p. 106), and nearly all English biographers
   and commentators, as Alford, Wordsworth, Howson, Lewin, Farrar,
   Plumptre, Ellicott, Lightfoot, defend the second captivity, and thus
   prolong the labors of Paul for a few years. On the other hand not only
   radical and skeptical critics, as Baur, Zeller, Schenkel, Reuss,
   Holtzmann, and all who reject the Pastoral Epistles (except Renan), but
   also conservative exegetes and historians, as Niedner, Thiersch, Meyer,
   Wieseler, Ebrard, Otto, Beck, Pressensé, deny the second captivity. I
   have discussed the problem at length in my Hist. of the Apost. Church,
   § 87, pp. 328-347, and spin in my annotations to Lange on Romans, pp.
   10-12. I will restate the chief arguments in favor of a second
   captivity, partly in rectification of my former opinion.

   1. The main argument are the Pastoral Epistles, if genuine, as I hold
   them to be, notwithstanding all the objections of the opponents from De
   Wette (1826) and Baur (1835) to Renan (1873) and Holtzmann (1880). It
   is, indeed, not impossible to assign them to any known period in Paul's
   life before his captivity, as during his three years' sojourn in
   Ephesus (54-57), or his eighteen months' sojourn in Corinth (52-53),
   but it is very difficult to do so. The Epistles presuppose journeys of
   the apostle not mentioned in Acts, and belong apparently to an advanced
   period in his life, as well as in the history of truth and error in the
   apostolic church.

   2. The release of Timothy from a captivity in Italy, probably in Rome,
   to which the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews 13:23 alludes, may
   have some connection with the release of Paul, who had probably a share
   in the inspiration, if not in the composition, of that remarkable
   production.

   3. The oldest post-apostolic witness is Clement of Rome, who wrote
   about 95:, Paul ... having come to the limit of the West (epi to terma
   tes duseos elthon) and borne witness before the magistrates (marturesas
   epi ton hegoumenon, which others translate, "having suffered martyrdom
   under the rulers"), departed from the world and went to the holy place,
   having furnished the sublimest model of endurance" (Ad Corinth. c. 5).
   Considering that Clement wrote in Rome, the most natural interpretation
   of terma tes duseos, "the extreme west," is Spain or Britain; and as
   Paul intended to carry the gospel to Spain, one would first think of
   that country, which was in constant commercial intercourse with Rome,
   and had produced distinguished statesmen and writers like Seneca and
   Lucan. Strabo (II. 1) calls the pillars of Hercules perata tes
   oikoumenes; and Velleius Paterc. calls Spain "extremus nostri orbis
   terminus." See Lightfoot, St. Clement, p. 50. But the inference is
   weakened by the absence of any trace or tradition of Paul's visit to
   Spain. [430] Still less can he have suffered martyrdom there, as the
   logical order of the words would imply. And as Clement wrote to the
   Corinthians, he may, from their geographical standpoint, have called
   the Roman capital the end of the West. At all events the passage is
   rhetorical (it speaks of seven imprisonments, heptakis desma phoresas),
   and proves nothing for further labors in the East. [431]

   4. An incomplete passage in the fragmentary Muratorian canon (about
   a.d. 170): "Sed profectionem Pauli ab urbe ad Spaniam proficiscentis
   ..." seems to imply a journey of Paul to Spain, which Luke has omitted;
   but this is merely a conjecture, as the verb has to be supplied. Comp.,
   however, Westcott, The Canon of the N. Test., p. 189, and Append. C.,
   p. 467, and Renan, L'Antechrist, p. 106 sq.

   5. Eusebius (d. 310) first clearly asserts that "there is a tradition
   (logos echei) that the apostle, after his defence, again set forth to
   the ministry of his preaching and having entered a second time the same
   city [Rome], was perfected by his martyrdom before him [Nero]." Hist.
   Eccl. II. 22 (comp. ch. 25). But the force of this testimony is
   weakened first by its late date; secondly, by the vague expression
   logos echei, "it is said," and the absence of any reference to older
   authorities (usually quoted by Eusebius); thirdly, by his
   misunderstanding of 2 Tim. 4:16, 17, which he explains in the same
   connection of a deliverance from the first imprisonment (as if
   apologiawere identical with aichmalosia); and lastly by his
   chronological mistake as to the time of the first imprisonment which,
   in his "Chronicle," he misdates a.d. 58, that is, three years before
   the actual arrival of Paul in Rome. On the other hand he puts the
   conflagration of Rome two years too late, a.d. 66, instead of 64, and
   the Neronian persecution, and the martyrdom of Paul and Peter, in the
   year 70.

   6. Jerome (d. 419): "Paul was dismissed by Nero that he might preach
   Christ's gospel also in the regions of the West (in Occidentis quoque
   partibus). De Vir. ill. sub Paulus. This echoes the terma tes duseosof
   Clement. Chrysostom (d. 407), Theodoret, and other fathers assert that
   Paul went to Spain (Rom. 15:28), but without adducing any proof.

   These post-apostolic testimonies, taken together, make it very
   probable, but not historically certain, that Paul was released after
   the spring of 63, and enjoyed an Indian summer of missionary work
   before his Martyrdom. The only remaining monuments, as well as the best
   proof, of this concluding work are the Pastoral Epistles, if we admit
   them to be genuine. To my mind the historical difficulties of the
   Pastoral Epistles are an argument for rather than against their Pauline
   origin. For why should a forger invent difficulties when he might so
   easily have fitted his fictions in the frame of the situation known
   from the Acts and the other Pauline Epistles? The linguistic and other
   objections are by no means insurmountable, and are overborne by the
   evidence of the Pauline spirit which animates these last productions of
   his pen.

   still shown in Damascus, as is also the street called Straight, the
   house of Judas, and the house of Ananias. But these local traditions
   are uncertain.

   [413] Gal. 1:18-24; Comp. Acts 9:26, 27.

   [414] Acts 22:17-21. It is remarkable that in his prayer he confessed
   his sin against "Stephen the martyr;" thus making public reparation for
   a public sin in the city where it was committed.

   [415] Acts 11:28-30; 12:25.

   [416] "Paul left Athens," says Farrar (I. 550 sq.), "a despised and
   lonely man. And yet his visit was not in vain .... He founded no church
   at Athens, but there-it may be under the fostering charge of the
   converted Areopagite-a church grew up. In the next century it furnished
   to the cause of Christianity its martyr bishops and its eloquent
   apologists (Publius, Quadratus, Aristides, Athenagoras). In the third
   century it flourished in peace and purity. In the fourth century it was
   represented at Nicaea, and the noble rhetoric of the two great
   Christian friends, St. Basil and St. Gregory of Nazianzus, was trained
   in its Christian schools. Nor were many centuries to elapse ere, unable
   to confront the pierced hands which held a wooden cross, its myriads of
   deities had fled into the dimness of outworn creeds, and its tutelary
   goddess, in spite of the flashing eyes which Homer had commemorated,
   and the mighty spear which had been moulded out of the trophies of
   Marathon, resigned her maiden chamber to the honour of that meek
   Galilaean maiden who had lived under the roof of the carpenter at
   Nazareth-the virgin mother of the Lord." Yet Athens was one of the last
   cities in the Roman empire which abandoned idolatry, and it never took
   a prominent position in church history. Its religion was the worship of
   ancient Greek genius rather than that of Christ. "Il est been moins
   disciple de Jésus et de saint Paul que de Plutarque et de Julien," says
   Renan, St. Paul, p. 208. His chapter on Paul in Athens is very
   interesting.

   [417] In Corinth Paul wrote that fearful, yet truthful description of
   pagan depravity in Rom. 1:18 sqq. The city was proverbially corrupt, so
   that korinthiazomai means to practise whoredom, and korinthiastes, a
   whoremonger. The great temple of Venus on the acropolis had more than a
   thousand courtezans devoted to the service of lust. With good reason
   Bengel calls a church of God in Corinth a "laetum et ingens paradoxon
   (in 1 Cor. 1:2). See the lively description of Renan, St. Paul, ch.
   VIII. pp. 211 sqq

   [418] Weiss (Bibl. Theol. des N. T., 3d ed. p. 202) is inclined to
   assign the composition of the Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians
   to the period of the imprisonment at Caesarea. So also Thiersch, Reuss,
   Schenkel, Meyer, Zöckler, Hausrath. See Meyer Com. on Eph. (5th ed. by
   Woldemar Schmidt, 1878, p. 18), and on the other side, Neander,
   Wieseler, and Lightfoot (Philippians, 3d ed. 1873, p. 29), who date all
   the Epistles of the captivity from Rome.

   [419] Acts 28:30, 31. Comp. the Epistles of the captivity.

   [420] Bengel remarks on Acts 28:31 "Paulus Romae, apex evangelii,
   Actorum finis: quae Lucas alioqui (2 Tim. 4:11)facile potuisset ad
   exitum Pauli perducere. Hierosolymis coepit: Romae desinit." The
   abruptness of the close seems not to be accidental, for, as Lightfoot
   remarks (Com. on Philippians, p. 3, note), there is a striking
   parallelism between the Acts and the Gospel of Luke in their beginning
   and ending, and there could be no fitter termination of the narrative,
   since it is the realization of that promise of the universal spread of
   the gospel which is the starting-point of the Acts.

   [421] Namely, to Ephesus 1 Tim. 1:3; 2 Tim. 4:13, 20; to Crete, Tit.
   1:5 and to Nicopolis, Tit. 3:12.

   [422] Phil. 1:25; 2:24; Philem. 22. These passages, however, are not
   conclusive, for the Apostle claims no infallibility in personal matters
   and plans; he was wavering between the expectation and desire of speedy
   martyrdom and further labors for the brethren, Phil. 1:20-23; 2:17. He
   may have been foiled in his contemplated visit to Philippi and Colosse.

   [423] Rom. 15:24, 28. Renan denies a visit to the Orient, but thinks
   that the last labors of Paul were spent in Spain or Gaul, and that he
   died in Rome by the sword, a.d. 64 or later (L'Antechrist, 106, 190).
   Dr. Plumptre (in the Introduction to his Com. on Luke, and in an
   Appendix to his Com. on Acts) ingeniously conjectures some connection
   between Luke, Paul's companion, and the famous poet, M. Annaeus Lucanus
   (the author of the Pharsalia, and a nephew of Seneca), who was a native
   of Corduba (Cordova) in Spain, and on this basis he accounts for the
   favorable conduct of J. Annaeus Gallic (Seneca's brother) toward Paul
   at Corinth, the early tradition of a friendship between Paul and
   Seneca, and Paul's journey to Spain. Rather fanciful.

   [427] Ewald (VI. 631) conjectures that Paul, on hearing of the Neronian
   persecution, hastened back to Rome of his own accord, to bear testimony
   to Christ, and being seized there, was again brought to trial and
   condemned to death, a.d. 65. Ewald assumes an intervening visit to
   Spain, but not to the East.

   [428] 2 Tim. 4:6-8. Bengel calls this Epistle testamentum Pauli et

   in extirpating the new superstition, Gruter, Inscript., p. 238, is now

   [431] I must here correct an error into which I have fallen with Dr.
   Wieseler, in my Hist. of the Ap. Ch., p. 342, by reading hupo to terma
   and interpreting it "before the highest tribunal of the West."epi is
   the reading of the Cod. Alex. (though defectively written), as I have
   convinced myself by an inspection of the Codex in the British Museum in
   1869, in the presence of Mr. Holmes and the late Dr. Tregelles. The
   preposition stands at the end of line 17, fol. 159b, second col., in
   the IVth vol. of the Codex, and is written in smaller letters from want
   of space, but by the original hand. The same reading is confirmed by
   the newly discovered MS. of Bryennios.

   the account of Acts as a Tendenz- Roman, or partisan fiction: "The
   narrative of Paul is certainly trustworthy, but one-sided, which was
   unavoidable, considering his personal apologetic aim, and passes by in
   silence what is foreign to that aim. The narrative of Acts follows oral

   The question of circumcision, or of the terms of admission of the
   Gentiles to the Christian church, was a burning question of the
   apostolic age. It involved the wider question of the binding authority
   of the Mosaic law, yea, the whole relation of Christianity to Judaism.
   For circumcision was in the synagogue what baptism is in the church, a
   divinely appointed sign and seal of the covenant of man with God, with
   all its privileges and responsibilities, and bound the circumcised
   person to obey the whole law on pain of forfeiting the blessing
   promised. Upon the decision of this question depended the peace of the
   church within, and the success of the gospel without. With
   circumcision, as a necessary condition of church membership,
   Christianity would forever have been confined to the Jewish race with a
   small minority of proselytes of the gate, or half-Christians while the
   abrogation of circumcision and the declaration of the supremacy and
   sufficiency of faith in Christ ensured the conversion of the heathen
   and the catholicity of Christianity. The progress of Paul's mission
   among the Gentiles forced the question to a solution and resulted in a
   grand act of emancipation, yet not without great struggle and temporary
   reactions.

   All the Christians of the first generation were converts from Judaism
   or heathenism. It could not be expected that they should suddenly lose
   the influence of opposite kinds of religious training and blend at once
   in unity. Hence the difference between Jewish and Gentile Christianity
   throughout the apostolic age, more or less visible in all departments
   of ecclesiastical life, in missions, doctrine, worship, and government.
   At the head of the one division stood Peter, the apostle of the
   circumcision; at the head of the other, Paul, to whom was intrusted the
   apostleship of the uncircumcision. In another form the same difference
   even yet appears between the different branches of Christendom. The
   Catholic church is Jewish-Christian or Petrine in its character; the
   Evangelical church is Gentile or Pauline. And the individual members of
   these bodies lean to one or the other of these leading types.
   Where-ever there is life and motion in a denomination or sect, there
   will be at least two tendencies of thought and action--whether they be
   called old and new school, or high church and low church, or by any
   other party name. In like manner there is no free government without
   parties. It is only stagnant waters that never run and overflow, and
   corpses that never move.

   The relation between these two fundamental forms of apostolic
   Christianity is in general that of authority and freedom, law and
   gospel, the conservative and the progressive, the objective and the
   subjective. These antithetic elements are not of necessity mutually
   exclusive. They are mutually complemental, and for perfect life they
   must co-exist and co-operate. But in reality they often run to
   extremes, and then of course fall into irreconcilable contradiction.
   Exclusive Jewish Christianity sinks into Ebionism; exclusive Gentile
   Christianity into Gnosticism. And these heresies were by no means
   confined to the apostolic and post-apostolic ages; pseudo-Petrine and
   pseudo-Pauline errors, in ever-varying phases, run more or less
   throughout the whole history of the church.

   The Jewish converts at first very naturally adhered as closely as
   possible to the sacred traditions of their fathers. They could not
   believe that the religion of the Old Testament, revealed by God
   himself, should pass away. They indeed regarded Jesus as the Saviour of
   Gentiles as well as Jews; but they thought Judaism the necessary
   introduction to Christianity, circumcision and the observance of the
   whole Mosaic law the sole condition of an interest in the Messianic
   salvation. And, offensive as Judaism was, rather than attractive, to
   the heathen, this principle would have utterly precluded the conversion
   of the mass of the Gentile world. [432] The apostles themselves were at
   first trammelled by this Judaistic prejudice, till taught better by the
   special revelation to Peter before the conversion of Cornelius. [433]

   But even after the baptism of the uncircumcised centurion, and Peter's
   defence of it before the church of Jerusalem, the old leaven still
   wrought in some Jewish Christians who had formerly belonged to the
   rigid and exclusive sect of the Pharisees. [434] They came from Judaea
   to Antioch, and taught the converts of Paul and Barnabas: "Except ye be
   circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved." They no
   doubt appealed to the Pentateuch, the universal Jewish tradition, the
   circumcision of Christ, and the practice of the Jewish apostles, and
   created a serious disturbance. These ex-Pharisees were the same whom
   Paul, in the heat of controversy, more severely calls "false brethren
   insidiously or stealthily foisted in," who intruded themselves into the
   Christian brotherhood as spies and enemies of Christian liberty. [435]
   He clearly distinguishes them not only from the apostles, but also from
   the great majority of the brethren in Judaea who sincerely rejoiced in
   his conversion and glorified God for it. [436] They were a small, but
   very active and zealous minority, and full of intrigue. They compassed
   sea and land to make one proselyte. They were baptized with water, but
   not with the Holy Spirit. They were Christians in name, but
   narrow-minded and narrow-hearted Jews in fact. They were scrupulous,
   pedantic, slavish formalists, ritualists, and traditionalists of the
   malignant type. Circumcision of the flesh was to them of more
   importance than circumcision of the heart, or at all events an
   indispensable condition of salvation. [437] Such men could, of course,
   not understand and appreciate Paul, but hated and feared him as a
   dangerous radical and rebel. Envy and jealousy mixed with their
   religious prejudice. They got alarmed at the rapid progress of the
   gospel among the unclean Gentiles who threatened to soil the purity of
   the church. They could not close their eyes to the fact that the power
   was fast passing from Jerusalem to Antioch, and from the Jews to the
   Gentiles, but instead of yielding to the course of Providence, they
   determined to resist it in the name of order and orthodoxy, and to keep
   the regulation of missionary operations and the settlement of the terms
   of church membership in their own hands at Jerusalem, the holy centre
   of Christendom and the expected residence of the Messiah on his return.

   Whoever has studied the twenty-third chapter of Matthew and the pages
   of church history, and knows human nature, will understand perfectly
   this class of extra-pious and extra-orthodox fanatics, whose race is
   not dead yet and not likely to die out. They serve, however, the good
   purpose of involuntarily promoting the cause of evangelical liberty.

   The agitation of these Judaizing partisans and zealots brought the
   Christian church, twenty years after its founding, to the brink of a
   split which would have seriously impeded its progress and endangered
   its final success.

   The Conferences in Jerusalem.

   To avert this calamity and to settle this irrepressible conflict, the
   churches of Jerusalem and Antioch resolved to hold a private and a
   public conference at Jerusalem. Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas as
   commissioners to represent the Gentile converts. Paul, fully aware of
   the gravity of the crisis, obeyed at the same time an inner and higher
   impulse. [438] He also took with him Titus, a native Greek, as a living
   specimen of what the Spirit of God could accomplish without
   circumcision. The conference was held a.d. 50 or 51 (fourteen years
   after Paul's conversion). It was the first and in some respects the
   most important council or synod held in the history of Christendom,
   though differing widely from the councils of later times. It is placed
   in the middle of the book of Acts as the connecting link between the
   two sections of the apostolic church and the two epochs of its
   missionary history.

   The object of the Jerusalem consultation was twofold: first, to settle
   the personal relation between the Jewish and Gentile apostles, and to
   divide their field of labor; secondly, to decide the question of
   circumcision, and to define the relation between the Jewish and Gentile
   Christians. On the first point (as we learn from Paul) it effected a
   complete and final, on the second point (as we learn from Luke) a
   partial and temporary settlement. In the nature of the case the public
   conference in which the whole church took part, was preceded and
   accompanied by private consultations of the apostles. [439]

   1. Apostolic Recognition. The pillars of the Jewish Church, James,
   Peter, and John [440] --whatever their views may have been before--were
   fully convinced by the logic of events in which they recognized the
   hand of Providence that Paul as well as Barnabas by the extraordinary
   success of his labors had proven himself to be divinely called to the
   apostolate of the Gentiles. They took no exception and made no addition
   to his gospel. On the contrary, when they saw that God who gave grace
   and strength to Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision, gave
   grace and strength to Paul also for the conversion of the
   uncircumcision, they extended to him and to Barnabas the right hand of
   fellowship, with the understanding that they would divide as far as
   practicable the large field of labor, and that Paul should manifest his
   brotherly love and cement the union by aiding in the support of the
   poor, often persecuted and famine-stricken brethren of Judaea. This
   service of charity he had cheerfully done before, and as cheerfully and
   faithfully did afterward by raising collections among his Greek
   congregations and carrying the money in person to Jerusalem. [441] Such
   is the unequivocal testimony of the fraternal understanding among the
   apostles from the mouth of Paul himself. And the letter of the council
   officially recognizes this by mentioning "beloved" Barnabas [442] and
   Paul, as "men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
   Jesus Christ." This double testimony of the unity of the apostolic
   church is quite conclusive against the modern invention of an
   irreconcilable antagonism between Paul and Peter. [443]

   2. As regards the question of circumcision and the status of the
   Gentile Christians, there was a sharp conflict of opinions in open
   debate, under the very shadow of the inspired apostles. [444] There was
   strong conviction and feeling on both sides, plausible arguments were
   urged, charges and countercharges made, invidious inferences drawn,
   fatal consequences threatened. But the Holy Spirit was also present, as
   he is with every meeting of disciples who come together in the name of
   Christ, and overruled the infirmities of human nature which will crop
   out in every ecclesiastical assembly.

   The circumcision of Titus, as a test case, was of course strongly
   demanded by the Pharisaical legalists, but as strongly resisted by
   Paul, and not enforced. [445] To yield here even for a moment would
   have been fatal to the cause of Christian liberty, and would have
   implied a wholesale circumcision of the Gentile converts, which was
   impossible.

   But how could Paul consistently afterwards circumcise Timothy? [446]
   The answer is that he circumcised Timothy as a Jew, not as a Gentile,
   and that he did it as a voluntary act of expediency, for the purpose of
   making Timothy more useful among the Jews, who had a claim on him as
   the son of a Jewish mother, and would not have allowed him to teach in
   a synagogue without this token of membership; while in the case of
   Titus, a pure Greek, circumcision was demanded as a principle and as a
   condition of justification and salvation. Paul was inflexible in
   resisting the demands of false brethren, but always willing to
   accommodate himself to weak brethren, and to become as a Jew to the
   Jews and as a Gentile to the Gentiles in order to save them both. [447]
   In genuine Christian freedom he cared nothing for circumcision or
   uncircumcision as a mere rite or external condition, and as compared
   with the keeping of the commandments of God and the new creature in
   Christ. [448]

   In the debate Peter, of course, as the oecumenical chief of the Jewish
   apostles, although at that time no more a resident of Jerusalem, took a
   leading part, and made a noble speech which accords entirely with his
   previous experience and practice in the house of Cornelius, and with
   his subsequent endorsement of Paul's doctrine. [449] He was no
   logician, no rabbinical scholar, but he had admirable good sense and
   practical tact, and quickly perceived the true line of progress and
   duty. He spoke in a tone of personal and moral authority, but not of
   official primacy. [450] He protested against imposing upon the neck of
   the Gentile disciples the unbearable yoke of the ceremonial law, and
   laid down, as clearly as Paul, the fundamental principle that "Jews as
   well as Gentiles are saved only by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ."
   [451]

   After this bold speech, which created a profound silence in the
   assembly, Barnabas and Paul reported, as the best practical argument,
   the signal miracles which God had wrought among the Gentiles through
   their instrumentality.

   The last and weightiest speaker was James, the brother of the Lord, the
   local head of the Jewish Christian church and bishop of Jerusalem, who
   as such seems to have presided over the council. He represented as it
   were the extreme right wing of the Jewish church bordering close on the
   Judaizing faction. It was through his influence chiefly no doubt that
   the Pharisees were converted who created this disturbance. In a very
   characteristic speech he endorsed the sentiments of Symeon--he
   preferred to call Peter by his Jewish name--concerning the conversion
   of the Gentiles as being in accordance with ancient prophecy and divine
   fore-ordination; but he proposed a compromise to the effect that while
   the Gentile disciples should not be troubled with circumcision, they
   should yet be exhorted to abstain from certain practices which were
   particularly offensive to pious Jews, namely, from eating meat offered
   to idols, from tasting blood, or food of strangled animals, and from
   every form of carnal uncleanness. As to the Jewish Christians, they
   knew their duty from the law, and would be expected to continue in
   their time-honored habits.

   The address of James differs considerably from that of Peter, and meant
   restriction as well as freedom, but after all it conceded the main
   point at issue--salvation without circumcision. The address entirely
   accords in spirit and language with his own epistle, which represents
   the gospel as law, though "the perfect law of freedom," with his later
   conduct toward Paul in advising him to assume the vow of the Nazarites
   and thus to contradict the prejudices of the myriads of converted Jews,
   and with the Jewish Christian tradition which represents him as the
   model of an ascetic saint equally revered by devout Jews and
   Christians, as the "Rampart of the People" (Obliam), and the
   intercessor of Israel who prayed in the temple without ceasing for its
   conversion and for the aversion of the impending doom. [452] He had
   more the spirit of an ancient prophet or of John the Baptist than the
   spirit of Jesus (in whom he did not believe till after the
   resurrection), but for this very reason he had most authority over the
   Jewish Christians, and could reconcile the majority of them to the
   progressive spirit of Paul.

   The compromise of James was adopted and embodied in the following brief
   and fraternal pastoral letter to the Gentile churches. It is the oldest
   literary document of the apostolic age and bears the marks of the style
   of James: [453]

   "The apostles and the elder brethren [454] unto the brethren who are of
   the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we
   have heard, that some who went out from us have troubled you with
   words, subverting your souls, to whom we gave no commandment, it seemed
   good unto us, having come to be of one accord, to choose out men and
   send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have
   hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have
   sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the
   same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit,
   and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary
   things: that ye abstain from meats sacrificed to idols, and from blood,
   and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep
   yourselves, it shall be well with you. Farewell." [455]

   The decree was delivered by four special messengers, two representing
   the church at Antioch, Barnabas and Paul, and two from Jerusalem, Judas
   Barsabbas and Silas (or Silvanus), and read to the Syrian and Cilician
   churches which were agitated by the controversy. [456] The restrictions
   remained in full force at least eight years, since James reminded Paul
   of them on his last visit to Jerusalem in 58. [457] The Jewish
   Christians observed them no doubt with few exceptions till the downfall
   of idolatry, [458] and the Oriental church even to this day abstains
   from blood and things strangled; but the Western church never held
   itself bound to this part of the decree, or soon abandoned some of its
   restrictions.

   Thus by moderation and mutual concession in the spirit of peace and
   brotherly love a burning controversy was settled, and a split happily
   avoided.

   Analysis of the Decree.

   The decree of the council was a compromise and had two aspects: it was
   emancipatory, and restrictive.

   (1.) It was a decree of emancipation of the Gentile disciples from
   circumcision and the bondage of the ceremonial law. This was the chief
   point in dispute, and so far the decree was liberal and progressive. It
   settled the question of principle once and forever. Paul had triumphed.
   Hereafter the Judaizing doctrine of the necessity of circumcision for
   salvation was a heresy, a false gospel, or a perversion of the true
   gospel, and is denounced as such by Paul in the Galatians.

   (2.) The decree was restrictive and conservative on questions of
   expediency and comparative indifference to the Gentile Christians.
   Under this aspect it was a wise and necessary measure for the apostolic
   age, especially in the East, where the Jewish element prevailed, but
   not intended for universal and permanent use. In Western churches, as
   already remarked, it was gradually abandoned, as we learn from
   Augustine. It imposed upon the Gentile Christians abstinence from meat
   offered to idols, from blood, and from things strangled (as fowls and
   other animals caught in snares). The last two points amounted to the
   same thing. These three restrictions had a good foundation in the
   Jewish abhorrence of idolatry, and every thing connected with it, and
   in the Levitical prohibition. [459] Without them the churches in Judaea
   would not have agreed to the compact. But it was almost impossible to
   carry them out in mixed or in purely Gentile congregations; for it
   would have compelled the Gentile Christians to give up social
   intercourse with their unconverted kindred and friends, and to keep
   separate slaughter-houses, like the Jews, who from fear of
   contamination with idolatrous associations never bought meat at the
   public markets. Paul takes a more liberal view of this matter--herein
   no doubt dissenting somewhat from James--namely, that the eating of
   meat sacrificed to idols was in itself indifferent, in view of the
   vanity of idols; nevertheless he likewise commands the Corinthians to
   abstain from such meat out of regard for tender and weak consciences,
   and lays down the golden rule: "All things are lawful, but all things
   are not expedient; all things are lawful, but all things edify not. Let
   no man seek his own, but his neighbor's good." [460]

   It seems strange to a modern reader that with these ceremonial
   prohibitions should be connected the strictly moral prohibition of
   fornication. [461] But it must be remembered that the heathen
   conscience as to sexual intercourse was exceedingly lax, and looked
   upon it as a matter of indifference, like eating and drinking, and as
   sinful only in case of adultery where the rights of a husband are
   invaded. No heathen moralist, not even Socrates, or Plato, or Cicero,
   condemned fornication absolutely. It was sanctioned by the worship of
   Aphrodite at Corinth and Paphos, and practised to her honor by a host
   of harlot-priestesses! Idolatry or spiritual whoredom is almost
   inseparable from bodily pollution. In the case of Solomon polytheism
   and polygamy went hand in hand. Hence the author of the Apocalypse also
   closely connects the eating of meat offered to idols with fornication,
   and denounces them together. [462] Paul had to struggle against this
   laxity in the Corinthian congregation, and condemns all carnal
   uncleanness as a violation and profanation of the temple of God. [463]
   In this absolute prohibition of sexual impurity we have a striking
   evidence of the regenerating and sanctifying influence of Christianity.
   Even the ascetic excesses of the post-apostolic writers who denounced
   the second marriage as "decent adultery" (euprepes moicheia), and
   glorified celibacy as a higher and better state than honorable wedlock,
   command our respect, as a wholesome and necessary reaction against the
   opposite excesses of heathen licentiousness.

   So far then as the Gentile Christians were concerned the question was
   settled.

   The status of the Jewish Christians was no subject of controversy, and
   hence the decree is silent about them. They were expected to continue
   in their ancestral traditions and customs as far as they were at all
   consistent with loyalty to Christ. They needed no instruction as to
   their duty, "for," said James, in his address to the Council, "Moses
   from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being
   read in the synagogues every Sabbath." [464] And eight years afterwards
   he and his elders intimated to Paul that even he, as a Jew, was
   expected to observe the ceremonial law, and that the exemption was only
   meant for the Gentiles. [465]

   But just here was a point where the decree was deficient. It went far
   enough for the temporary emergency, and as far as the Jewish church was
   willing to go, but not far enough for the cause of Christian union and
   Christian liberty in its legitimate development.

   Notes

   1. The Apostolic Conference at Jerusalem.--This has been one of the
   chief battle-fields of modern historical criticism. The controversy of
   circumcision has been fought over again in German, French, Dutch, and
   English books and essays, and the result is a clearer insight both into
   the difference and into the harmony of the apostolic church.

   We have two accounts of the Conference, one from Paul in the second
   chapter of the Galatians, and one from his faithful companion, Luke, in
   Acts 15. For it is now almost universally admitted that they refer to
   the same event. They must be combined to make up a full history. The
   Epistle to the Galatians is the true key to the position, the
   Archimedian pou sto.

   The accounts agree as to the contending parties--Jerusalem and
   Antioch--the leaders on both sides, the topic of controversy, the sharp
   conflict, and the peaceful result.

   But in other respects they differ considerably and supplement each
   other. Paul, in a polemic vindication of his independent apostolic
   authority against his Judaizing antagonists in Galatia, a few years
   after the Council (about 56), dwells chiefly on his personal
   understanding with the other apostles and their recognition of his
   authority, but he expressly hints also at public conferences, which
   could not be avoided; for it was a controversy between the churches,
   and an agreement concluded by the leading apostles on both sides was of
   general authority, even if it was disregarded by a heretical party.
   Luke, on the other hand, writing after the lapse of at least thirteen
   years (about 63) a calm and objective history of the primitive church,
   gives (probably from Jerusalem and Antioch documents, but certainly not
   from Paul's Epistles) the official action of the public assembly, with
   an abridgment of the preceding debates, without excluding private
   conferences; on the contrary he rather includes them; for he reports in
   Acts 15:5, that Paul and Barnabas "were received by the church and the
   apostles and elders and declared all things that God had done with
   them," before he gives an account of the public consultation, ver. 6.
   In all assemblies, ecclesiastical and political, the more important
   business is prepared and matured by Committees in private conference
   for public discussion and action; and there is no reason why the
   council in Jerusalem should have made an exception. The difference of
   aim then explains, in part at least, the omissions and minor variations
   of the two accounts, which we have endeavored to adjust in this
   section.

   The ultra- and pseudo-Pauline hypercriticism of the Tübingen school in
   several discussions (by Baur, Schwegler, Zeller, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar,
   Holsten, Overbeck, Lipsius, Hausrath, and Wittichen) has greatly
   exaggerated these differences, and used Paul's terse polemic allusions
   as a lever for the overthrow of the credibility of the Acts. But a more
   conservative critical reaction has recently taken place, partly in the
   same school (as indicated in the literature above), which tends to
   harmonize the two accounts and to vindicate the essential consensus of
   Petrinism and Paulinism.

   2. The Circumcision of Titus.--We hold with most commentators that
   Titus was not circumcised. This is the natural sense of the difficult
   and much disputed passage, Gal. 2:3-5, no matter whether we take dein
   2:4 in the explanatory sense (nempe, and that), or in the usual
   adversative sense (autem, sed, but). In the former case the sentence is
   regular, in the latter it is broken, or designedly incomplete, and
   implies perhaps a slight censure of the other apostles, who may have
   first recommended the circumcision of Titus as a measure of prudence
   and conciliation out of regard to conservative scruples, but desisted
   from it on the strong remonstrance of Paul. If we press the
   enankasthecompelled, in 2:3, such an inference might easily be drawn,
   but there was in Paul's mind a conflict between the duty of frankness
   and the duty of courtesy to his older colleagues. So Dr. Lightfoot
   accounts for the broken grammar of the sentence, "which was wrecked on
   the hidden rock of the counsels of the apostles of the circumcision."

   Quite another view was taken by Tertullian (Adv. Marc., V. 3), and
   recently by Renan (ch. III. p. 89) and Farrar (I. 415), namely, that
   Titus voluntarily submitted to circumcision for the sake of peace,
   either in spite of the remonstrance of Paul, or rather with his
   reluctant consent. Paul seems to say that Titus was not circumcised,
   but implies that he was. This view is based on the omission of ois
   oudein 2:5. The passage then would have to be supplemented in this way:
   "But not even Titus was compelled to be circumcised, but [he submitted
   to circumcision voluntarily] on account of the stealthily introduced
   false brethren, to whom we yielded by way of submission for an hour
   [i.e., temporarily]." Renan thus explains the meaning: "If Titus was
   circumcised, it is not because he was forced, but on account of the
   false brethren, to whom we might yield for a moment without submitting
   ourselves in principle." He thinks that pros horanis opposed to the
   following diameine.In other words, Paul stooped to conquer. He yielded
   for a moment by a stretch of charity or a stroke of policy, in order to
   save Titus from violence, or to bring his case properly before the
   Council and to achieve a permanent victory of principle. But this view
   is entirely inconsistent not only with the frankness and firmness of
   Paul on a question of principle, with the gravity of the crisis, with
   the uncompromising tone of the Epistle to the Galatians, but also with
   the addresses of Peter and James, and with the decree of the council.
   If Titus was really circumcised, Paul would have said so, and explained
   his relation to the fact. Moreover, the testimony of Irenaeus and
   Tertullian against hois oudemust give way to the authority of the best
   uncials ('B A C, etc) and versions in favor of these words. The
   omission can be better explained from carelessness or dogmatic
   prejudice rather than the insertion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [432] "Circumcision," says Renan (St. Paul, ch. III. p. 67)."was, for
   adults, a painful ceremony, one not without danger, and disagreeable to
   the last degree. It was one of the reasons which prevented the Jews
   from moving freely about among other people, and set them apart as a
   caste by themselves. At the baths and gymnasiums, those important parts
   of the ancient cities, circumcision exposed the Jew to all sorts of
   affronts. Every time that the attention of the Greeks and Romans was
   directed to this subject, outbursts of jestings followed. The Jews were
   very sensitive in this regard, and avenged themselves by cruel
   reprisals. Several of them, in order to escape the ridicule, and
   washing to pass themselves off for Greeks, strove to efface the
   original mark by a surgical operation of which Celsus has preserved us
   the details. As to the converts who accepted this initiation ceremony,
   they had only one course to pursue, and that was to hide themselves in
   order to escape sarcastic taunts. Never did a man of the world place
   himself in such a position; and this is doubtless the reason why
   conversions to Judaism were much more numerous among women than among
   men, the former not being put, at the very outset, to a test, in every
   respect repulsive and shocking. We have many examples of Jewesses
   married to heathens, but not a single one of a Jew married to a heathen
   woman."

   [433] Acts 10 and 11.

   [434] Acts 15:1, 5:tines ton apo tes haireseos ton Pharisaion
   pepisteukotes .

   [435] Gal. 2:4: pareisaktoi (comp. pareisaxousin in 2 Pet. 2:1)
   pseudadelphoi hoitines pareiselthon(who came in sideways, or crept in,
   sneaked in; comp. Jude 4, pareisedusan) kataskopesai ten eleutherian
   hemon hen echomen en Christo Iesou, hina hemas katadoulosousin . The
   emissaries of these Pharisaical Judaizers are ironically called
   "super-extra-apostles,"huperlian apostoloi, 2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11. For
   these are not the real apostles (as Baur and his followers maintained
   in flat contradiction to the connection of 2 Cor. 10 to 12), but
   identical with the "false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
   themselves into apostles of Christ,"2 Cor. 11:13. Baur's monstrous
   misinterpretation has been completely refuted by Weizsäcker (on Paul
   and the Congregation of Corinth, l.c. p. 640), Keim, Klöpper, Wieseler,
   and Grimm (l.c. 432). Comp. also Godet, l.c. pp. 49 sq.

   [436] Gal. 1:22-24.

   [437] To what ridiculous extent some Jewish rabbis of the rigid school
   of Shammai carried the overestimate of circumcision, may be seen from
   the following deliverances quoted by Farrar (I. 401): "So great is
   circumcision that but for it the Holy One, blessed be He, would not
   have created the world; for it is said (Jer. 33:25), 'But for my
   covenant [circumcision] I would not have made day and night, and the
   ordinance of heaven and earth.'"" Abraham was not called 'perfect' till
   he was circumcised."

   [438] Paul mentions the subjective motive, Luke the objective call.
   Both usually unite in important trusts. But Baur and Lipsius make this
   one of the irreconcilable contradictions!

   [439] Luke reports the former and hints at the latter (comp. Acts 5 and
   6) Paul reports the private understanding and hints at the public
   conference, saying (Gal. 2:2): "I laid (anethemen) before them [the
   brethren of Jerusalem] the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles,
   but privately before them who were of repute (or, before those in
   authority),"i.e., the pillar-apostles of the circumcision, James,
   Cephas, and John, comp. Acts 2:9. Dr. Baur who denies the public
   conference, mistranslates kat idian de tois dokousin und zwar wandte
   ich mich speciell (specially) an die vorzugsweise Geltenden,"so that
   tois dokousin would be the same as the preceding autois (Paul, ch. V.
   p. 117, in the English translation, I. 122). But this would have been
   more naturally expressed by tois dokousin en autois and kat idian, as
   Grimm, the lexicographer of the N. T., remarks against Baur (l.c., p.
   412), does not mean "specially" at all, but privatim, seorsum, "apart,"
   "in private," as in Mark 4:34, and kat idian eipein, Diod. I. 21.

   [440] The order in which they are named by Paul is significant: James
   first, as the bishop of Jerusalem and the most conservative, John last,
   as the most liberal of the Jewish apostles. There is no irony in the
   term oi dokontes and oi stuloi, certainly not at the expense of the
   apostles who were pillars in fact as well as in name and repute. If
   there is any irony in Gal 2:6, hopoioi pote esan, ouden moi diapherei,
   it is directed against the Judaizers who overestimated the Jewish
   apostles to the disparagement of Paul. Even Keim (l.c., p. 74) takes
   this view: "Endlich mag man aufhören, von ironischer Bitterkeit des
   Paulus gegenüber den Geltenden zu reden: denn wer gleich nachher den
   Bundesschluss mit den 'Säulen'feierlich und befriedigt registrirt, der
   hat seine Abweisung der menschlichen Autoritäten in v. 6nicht dem
   Andenken der Apostel gewidmet, sondern dem notorischen Uebermuth der
   judenchristlichen Parteigänger in Galatien."

   [441] Gal. 2:7-10; comp. Acts 11:30; 24:17; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 8 and
   9; Rom. 15:25-27.

   [442] Barnabas, as the older disciple, still retained precedence in the
   Jewish church, and hence is named first. A later forger would have
   reversed the order.

   [443] Dr. Plumptre remarks against the Tübingen critics (on Acts 15:7):
   "Of all doctrines as to the development of the Christian church, that
   which sees in Peter, James, and John the leaders of a Judaizing
   anti-Pauline party is, perhaps, the most baseless and fantastic. The
   fact that their names were unscrupulously used by that party, both in
   their lifetime and, as the pseudo-Clementine Homilies and Recognitions
   show, after their death, cannot outweigh their own deliberate words and
   acts."

   [444] This is very evident from the indignant tone of Paul against the
   Judaizers, and from the remark in Acts 15:6: polles suzeteseos
   genomenes, comp. Acts 15:2: genomenes staseos(factious party spirit,
   insurrection, Luke 23:19; Mark 15:7) kai zeteseos ouk oliges. Such
   strong terms show that Luke by no means casts the veil of charity over
   the differences in the apostolic church.

   [445] Gal. 2:3-5. See the note below.

   [446] Acts 16:3. The silence of Luke concerning the non-circumcision of
   Titus has been distorted by the Tübingen critics into a wilful
   suppression of fact, and the mention of the circumcision of Timothy
   into a fiction to subserve the catholic unification of Petrinism and
   Paulinism. What a designing and calculating man this anonymous author
   of the Acts must have been, and yet not shrewd enough to conceal his
   literary fraud or to make it more plausible by adapting it to the
   account in the Galatians, and by mentioning the full understanding
   between the apostles themselves! The book of Acts is no more a full
   history of the church or of the apostles than the Gospels are full
   biographies of Christ.

   [447] Comp. Rom. 14 and 15; 1 Cor. 9:19-23; Acts 21:23-26.

   [448] Gal. 5:6; 6:15; 1 Cor. 7:19. Dr. Plumptre's remarks on the last
   passage are to the point: "Often those who regard some ceremony as
   unimportant magnify the very disregard of it into a necessary virtue.
   The apostle carefully guards against that by expressing the nothingness
   of both circumcision and uncircumcision (Rom. 2:25; Gal. 5:6; 6:15).
   The circumicision of Timothy, and the refusal to circumcise Titus by
   St. Paul himself, are illustrations at once of the application of the
   truth here enforced, and of the apostle's scrupulous adherence to the
   principles of his own teaching. To have refused to circumcise Timothy
   would have attached some value to noncircumcision. To have circumcised
   Titus would have attached some value to circumcision."

   [449] Acts 15:7-11; comp. Acts 10: 28 sqq.; 1 Pet. 1:12; 5:12; 2 Pet.
   3:15, 16. The style of Peter is distinctly recognizable, as in the
   epithet of God, ho kardiognoste, Acts 15:8, comp. Acts 1:24. Such
   minute coincidences go to strengthen the documentary trustworthiness of
   the Acts.

   [450] Like the Popes, who do not attend synods at Jerusalem or
   elsewhere and make speeches, but expect all doctrinal controversies to
   be referred to them for their final and infallible decision.

   [451] Acts15:11: tes charitos tou kuriou Iesou pisteuomen sothen'ai,
   kath' hon tropon kakeinoi (the heathen). Comp. Rom. 10:12, 13.

   [452] Comp. Acts15:13-21; 21:18-25; James 1:25; 2:12; and the account
   of Hegesippus quoted in § 27, p. 274.

   [453] The Gentile form of greeting, chairein, Acts 15:23, occurs again
   in James 1:1, but nowhere else in the New Testament, except in the
   letter of the heathen, Claudius Lysias (Acts 23:26); the usual form
   being charis kai eirene. This is likewise one of those incidental
   coincidences and verifications which are beyond the ken of a forger.

   [454] According to the oldest reading, hoi apostoloi kai hoi
   presbuteroi adelphoi, which may also be rendered: "the apostles, and
   the presbyters, brethren;" comp. Acts 15:22. The omission of adelphoi
   in some MSS. may be due to the later practice, which excluded the laity
   from synodical deliberations.

   [455] Acts 15:23-29.

   [456] Acts 16:4

   [457] Acts 21:15. Comp. also Rev. 2:14, 20. But why does Paul never
   refer to this synodical decree? Because he could take a knowledge of it
   for granted, or more probably because he did not like altogether its
   restrictions, which were used by the illiberal constructionists against
   him and against Peter at Antioch (Gal. 2:12). Weizsäcker and Grimm
   (l.c., p. 423) admit the historic character of some such compromise,
   but transfer it to a later period (Acts 21:25), as a proposition made
   by James of a modus vivendi with Gentile converts, and arbitrarily
   charge the Acts with an anachronism. But the consultation must have
   come to a result, the result embodied in a formal action, and the
   action communicated to the disturbed churches.

   [458] Justin Martyr, about the middle of the second century, considered
   the eating of eidolothuta as bad as idolatry. Dial. c. Tryph. Jud. 35

   [459] Ex. 34:,15; Lev. 17:7 sqq.; Deut. 12:23 sqq. The reason assigned
   for the prohibition of the taste of blood is that "the life of the
   flesh is in the blood," and the pouring out of blood is the means of
   "the atonement for the soul" (Lev. 17:11). The prohibition of blood as
   food was traced back to the time of Noah, Gen. 9:4, and seems to have
   been included in the seven "Noachian commandments" so-called, which
   were imposed upon the proselytes of the gate, although the Talmud
   nowhere specifies them very clearly. The Moslems likewise abhor the
   tasting of blood. But the Greeks and Romans regarded it as a delicacy.
   It was a stretch of liberality on the part of the Jews that pork was
   not included among the forbidden articles of food. Bentley proposed to
   read in Acts 15:20 porkeia (fromporkos, porcus) for porneia, but
   without a shadow of evidence.

   [460] 1 Cor. 8:7-13; 10:23-33; Rom. 14:2, 21; 1 Tim. 4:4.

   [461] The word por'neia, without addition, must be taken in its usual
   sense, and cannot mean illegitimate marriages alone, which were
   forbidden to the Jews, Ex. 34; Lev. 18, although it may include them

   [462] Apoc. 2:14, 20.

   [463] 1 Cor. 6:13-20; comp. 1 Cor. 5:9; 1 Thess. 4:4, 5; Eph. 5:3, 5;
   Col. 3:5. What a contrast between these passages and the sentence of
   Micio in Terence. "Non es flagitium, mihi crede, adulescentulum
   Scortari, neque potare."--Adelph. i. 2. 21, 22. (Ed. Fleckeisen p.
   290.) To which, however, Demea (his more virtuous married brother)
   replies: "Pro Juppiter, tu homo adigis me ad insaniam. Non est
   flagitium facere haec adulescentulum?"--Adelph. i. 2. 31, 32

   [464] Acts 15:21; comp. Acts 13:15; 2 Cor. 3:14, 15.

   [465] Acts 21:20-25. Irenaeus understood the decree in this sense (Adv.
   Haer III. 12, 15: "Hi qui circa Jacobum apostoli gentibus quidem libere
   agere permittebant; ipsi vero ... perseverabant in pristinis
   observationibus ... religiose agebant circadispositionem legis quae est
   secundum Mosem."Pfleiderer (l.c. 284) takes a similar view on this
   point, which is often overlooked, and yet most important for the proper
   understanding of the subsequent reaction. He says: "Die Judenchristen
   betreffend, wurde dabei stillschweigend als selbstverständliche
   Voraussetzung angenommen, dass bei diesen Alles beim Alten bleibe, dass
   also aus der Gesetzesfreiheit der Heidenchristen keierlei Consequenzen
   für die Abrogation des Gesetzes unter den Judenchristen zu ziehen
   seien; auf dieser Voraussetzung beruhte die Beschränkung der älteren
   Apostel auf die Wirksamkeit bei den Juden (da eine Ueberschreitung
   dieser Schranke ohne Verletzung des Gesetzes nicht möglich war); auf
   dieser Voraussetzung beruhte die Sendung der Leute von Jakobus aus
   Jerusalem nach Antiochia und beruhte der Einfluss derselben auf Petrus,
   dessen vorhergegangenes freieres Verhalten dadurch als eine Ausnahme
   von der Regel gekennzeichnet wird."

   § 35. The Conservative Reaction, and the Liberal Victory--

   Peter and Paul at Antioch.

   The Jerusalem compromise, like every other compromise, was liable to a
   double construction, and had in it the seed of future troubles. It was
   an armistice rather than a final settlement. Principles must and will
   work themselves out, and the one or the other must triumph.

   A liberal construction of the spirit of the decree seemed to demand
   full communion of the Jewish Christians with their uncircumcised
   Gentile brethren, even at the Lord's table, in the weekly or daily
   agapae, on the basis of the common saving faith in Christ, their common
   Lord and Saviour. But a strict construction of the letter stopped with
   the recognition of the general Christian character of the Gentile
   converts, and guarded against ecclesiastical amalgamation on the ground
   of the continued obligation of the Jewish converts to obey the
   ceremonial law, including the observance of circumcision, of the
   Sabbath and new moons, and the various regulations about clean and
   unclean meats, which virtually forbid social intercourse with unclean
   Gentiles. [466]

   The conservative view was orthodox, and must not be confounded with the
   Judaizing heresy which demanded circumcision from the Gentiles as well
   as the Jews, and made it a term of church membership and a condition of
   salvation. This doctrine had been condemned once for all by the
   Jerusalem agreement, and was held hereafter only by the malignant
   pharisaical faction of the Judaizers.

   The church of Jerusalem, being composed entirely of Jewish converts,
   would naturally take the conservative view; while the church of
   Antioch, where the Gentile element prevailed, would as naturally prefer
   the liberal interpretation, which had the certain prospect of ultimate
   success. James, who perhaps never went outside of Palestine, far from
   denying the Christian character of the Gentile converts, would yet keep
   them at a respectful distance; while Peter, with his impulsive,
   generous nature, and in keeping with his more general vocation, carried
   out in practice the conviction he had so boldly professed in Jerusalem,
   and on a visit to Antioch, shortly after the Jerusalem Council (a.d.
   51), openly and habitually communed at table with the Gentile brethren.
   [467] He had already once before eaten in the house of the
   uncircumcised Cornelius at Caesarea, seeing that "God is no respecter
   of persons, but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh
   righteousness is acceptable to him." [468]

   But when some delegates of James [469] arrived from Jerusalem and
   remonstrated with him for his conduct, he timidly withdrew from
   fellowship with the uncircumcised followers of Christ, and thus
   virtually disowned them. He unwittingly again denied his Lord from the
   fear of man, but this time in the persons of his Gentile disciples. The
   inconsistency is characteristic of his impulsive temper, which made him
   timid or bold according to the nature of the momentary impression. It
   is not stated whether these delegates simply carried out the
   instructions of James or went beyond them. The former is more probable
   from what we know of him, and explains more easily the conduct of
   Peter, who would scarcely have been influenced by casual and unofficial
   visitors. They were perhaps officers in the congregation of Jerusalem;
   at all events men of weight, not Pharisees exactly, yet extremely
   conservative and cautious, and afraid of miscellaneous company, which
   might endanger the purity and orthodoxy of the venerable mother church
   of Christendom. They did, of course, not demand the circumcision of the
   Gentile Christians, for this would have been in direct opposition to
   the synodical decree, but they no doubt reminded Peter of the
   understanding of the Jerusalem compact concerning the duty of Jewish
   Christians, which he above all others should scrupulously keep. They
   represented to him that his conduct was at least very hasty and
   premature, and calculated to hinder the conversion of the Jewish
   nation, which was still the object of their dearest hopes and most
   fervent prayers. The pressure must have been very strong, for even
   Barnabas, who had stood side by side with Paul at Jerusalem in the
   defence of the rights of the Gentile Christians, was intimidated and
   carried away by the example of the chief of the apostles.

   The subsequent separation of Paul from Barnabas and Mark, which the
   author of Acts frankly relates, was no doubt partly connected with this
   manifestation of human weakness. [470]

   The sin of Peter roused the fiery temper of Paul, and called upon him a
   sharper rebuke than he had received from his Master. A mere look of
   pity from Jesus was enough to call forth bitter tears of repentance.
   Paul was not Jesus. He may have been too severe in the manner of his
   remonstrance, but he knew Peter better than we, and was right in the
   matter of dispute, and after all more moderate than some of the
   greatest and best men have been in personal controversy. Forsaken by
   the prince of the apostles and by his own faithful ally in the Gentile
   mission, he felt that nothing but unflinching courage could save the
   sinking ship of freedom. A vital principle was at stake, and the
   Christian standing of the Gentile converts must be maintained at all
   hazards, now or never, if the world was to be saved and Christianity
   was not to shrink into a narrow corner as a Jewish sect. Whatever might
   do in Jerusalem, where there was scarcely a heathen convert, this open
   affront to brethren in Christ could not be tolerated for a moment at
   Antioch in the church which was of his own planting and full of
   Hellenists and Gentiles. A public scandal must be publicly corrected.
   And so Paul confronted Peter and charged him with downright hypocrisy
   in the face of the whole congregation. He exposed his misconduct by his
   terse reasoning, to which Peter could make no reply. [471] "If thou,"
   he said to him in substance, "who art a Jew by nationality and
   training, art eating with the Gentiles in disregard of the ceremonial
   prohibition, why art thou now, by the moral force of thy example as the
   chief of the Twelve, constraining the Gentile converts to Judaize or to
   conform to the ceremonial restraints of the elementary religion? We who
   are Jews by birth and not gross sinners like the heathen, know that
   justification comes not from works of the law, but from faith in
   Christ. It may be objected that by seeking gratuitous justification
   instead of legal justification, we make Christ a promoter of sin. [472]
   Away with this monstrous and blasphemous conclusion! On the contrary,
   there is sin in returning to the law for justification after we have
   abandoned it for faith in Christ. I myself stand convicted of
   transgression if I build up again (as thou doest now) the very law
   which I pulled down (as thou didst before), and thus condemn my former
   conduct. For the law itself taught me to exchange it for Christ, to
   whom it points as its end. Through the Mosaic law as a tutor leading me
   beyond itself to freedom in Christ, I died to the Mosaic law in order
   that I might live a new life of obedience and gratitude to God. I have
   been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer my old self that lives,
   but it is Christ that lives in me; and the new life of Christ which I
   now live in this body after my conversion, I live in the faith of the
   Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not frustrate the
   grace of God; for if the observance of the law of Moses or any other
   human work could justify and save, there was no good cause of Christ's
   death his atoning sacrifice on the cross was needless and fruitless."

   From such a conclusion Peter's soul shrank back in horror. He never
   dreamed of denying the necessity and efficacy of the death of Christ
   for the remission of sins. He and Barnabas stood between two fires on
   that trying occasion. As Jews they seemed to be bound by the
   restrictions of the Jerusalem compromise on which the messengers of
   James insisted; but by trying to please the Jews they offended the
   Gentiles, and by going back to Jewish exclusiveness they did violence
   to their better convictions, and felt condemned by their own
   conscience. [473] They no doubt returned to their more liberal
   practice.

   The alienation of the apostles was merely temporary. They were too
   noble and too holy to entertain resentment. Paul makes honorable
   mention afterwards of Peter and Barnabas, and also of Mark, who was a
   connecting link between the three. [474] Peter in his Epistles endorses
   the teaching of the "beloved brother Paul," and commends the wisdom of
   his Epistles, in one of which his own conduct is so severely rebuked,
   but significantly adds that there are some "things in them hard to be
   understood, which the ignorant and unsteadfast wrest, as they do also
   the other Scriptures, to their own destruction." [475]

   The scene of Antioch belongs to these things which have been often
   misunderstood and perverted by prejudice and ignorance in the interest
   both of heresy and orthodoxy. The memory of it was perpetuated by the
   tradition which divided the church at Antioch into two parishes with
   two bishops, Evodius and Ignatius, the one instituted by Peter, the
   other by Paul. Celsus, Porphyry, and modern enemies of Christianity
   have used it as an argument against the moral character and inspiration
   of the apostles. The conduct of Paul left a feeling of intense
   bitterness and resentment in the Jewish party which manifested itself
   even a hundred years later in a violent attack of the pseudo-Clementine
   Homilies and Recognitions upon Paul, under the disguise of Simon Magus.
   The conduct of both apostles was so unaccountable to Catholic taste
   that some of the fathers substituted an unknown Cephas for Peter; [476]
   while others resolved the scene into a hypocritical farce gotten up by
   the apostles themselves for dramatic effect upon the ignorant
   congregation. [477]

   The truth of history requires us to sacrifice the orthodox fiction of
   moral perfection in the apostolic church. But we gain more than we
   lose. The apostles themselves never claimed, but expressly disowned
   such perfection. [478] They carried the heavenly treasure in earthen
   vessels, and thus brought it nearer to us. The infirmities of holy men
   are frankly revealed in the Bible for our encouragement as well as for
   our humiliation. The bold attack of Paul teaches the right and duty of
   protest even against the highest ecclesiastical authority, when
   Christian truth and principle are endangered; the quiet submission of
   Peter commends him to our esteem for his humility and meekness in
   proportion to his high standing as the chief among the pillar-apostles;
   the conduct of both explodes the Romish fiction of papal supremacy and
   infallibility; and the whole scene typically foreshadows the grand
   historical conflict between Petrine Catholicism and Pauline
   Protestantism, which, we trust, will end at last in a grand Johannean
   reconciliation.

   Peter and Paul, as far as we know, never met afterwards till they both
   shed their blood for the testimony of Jesus in the capital of the
   world.

   The fearless remonstrance of Paul had probably a moderating effect upon
   James and his elders, but did not alter their practice in Jerusalem.
   [479] Still less did it silence the extreme Judaizing faction; on the
   contrary, it enraged them. They were defeated, but not convinced, and
   fought again with greater bitterness than ever. They organized a
   countermission, and followed Paul into almost every field of his labor,
   especially to Corinth and Galatia. They were a thorn, if not the thorn,
   in his flesh. He has them in view in all his Epistles except those to
   the Thessalonians and to Philemon. We cannot understand his Epistles in
   their proper historical sense without this fact. The false apostles
   were perhaps those very Pharisees who caused the original trouble, at
   all events men of like spirit. They boasted of their personal
   acquaintance with the Lord in the days of his flesh, and with the
   primitive apostles; hence Paul calls these "false apostles"
   sarcastically "super-eminent" or "over-extra-apostles." [480] They
   attacked his apostolate as irregular and spurious, and his gospel as
   radical and revolutionary. They boldly told his Gentile converts that
   the, must submit to circumcision and keep the ceremonial law; in other
   words, that they must be Jews as well as Christians in order to insure
   salvation, or at all events to occupy a position of pre-eminence over
   and above mere proselytes of the gate in the outer court. They
   appealed, without foundation, to James and Peter and to Christ himself,
   and abused their name and authority for their narrow sectarian
   purposes, just as the Bible itself is made responsible for all sorts of
   heresies and vagaries. They seduced many of the impulsive and
   changeable Galatians, who had all the characteristics of the Keltic
   race. They split the congregation in Corinth into several parties and
   caused the apostle the deepest anxiety. In Colossae, and the churches
   of Phrygia and Asia, legalism assumed the milder form of Essenic
   mysticism and asceticism. In the Roman church the legalists were weak
   brethren rather than false brethren, and no personal enemies of Paul,
   who treats them much more mildly than the Galatian errorists.

   This bigoted and most persistent Judaizing reaction was overruled for
   good. It drew out from the master mind of Paul the most complete and
   most profound vindication and exposition of the doctrines of sin and
   grace. Without the intrigues and machinations of these legalists and
   ritualists we should not have the invaluable Epistles to the Galatians,
   Corinthians, and Romans. Where error abounded, truth has still more
   abounded.

   At last the victory was won. The terrible persecution under Nero, and
   the still more terrible destruction of Jerusalem, buried the
   circumcision controversy in the Christian church. The ceremonial law,
   which before Christ was "alive but not life-giving," and which from
   Christ to the destruction of Jerusalem was "dying but not deadly,"
   became after that destruction "dead and deadly." [481] The Judaizing
   heresy was indeed continued outside of the Catholic church by the sect
   of the Ebionites during the second century; and in the church itself
   the spirit of formalism and bigotry assumed new shapes by substituting
   Christian rites and ceremonies for the typical shadows of the Mosaic
   dispensation. But whenever and wherever this tendency manifests itself
   we have the best antidote in the Epistles of Paul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [466] Without intending any censure, we may illustrate the position of
   the strict constructionists of the school of St. James by similar
   examples of conscientious and scrupulous exclusiveness. Roman Catholics
   know no church but their own, and refuse all religious fellowship with
   non Catholics; yet many of them will admit the action of divine grace
   and the possibility of salvation outside of the limits of the papacy.
   Some Lutherans maintain the principle: "Lutheran pulpits for Lutheran
   ministers only; Lutheran altars for Lutheran communicants only." Luther
   himself refused at Marburg the hand of fellowship to Zwingli, who was
   certainly a Christian, and agreed with him in fourteen out of fifteen
   articles of doctrine. High church Anglicans recognize no valid ministry
   without episcopal ordination; close communion Baptists admit no valid
   baptism but by immersion; and yet the Episcopalians do not deny the
   Christian character of non-Episcopalians, nor the Baptists the
   Christian character of Pedo-Baptists, while they would refuse to sit
   with them at the Lord's table. There are psalm-singing Presbyterians
   who would not even worship, and much less commune, with other
   Presbyterians who sing what they call "uninspired" hymns. In all these
   cases, whether consistently or not, a distinction is made between
   Christian fellowship and church fellowship. With reference to all these
   and other forms of exclusiveness we would say in the spirit of Paul:
   "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision" (viewed as a mere sign)
   "availeth anything, nor uncircumcision," neither Catholicism nor
   Protestantism, neither Lutheranism nor Calvinism, neither Calvinism nor
   Arminianism, neither episcopacy nor presbytery, neither immersion nor
   pouring nor sprinkling, nor any other accidental distinction of birth
   and outward condition, but "a new creature, faith working through love,
   and the keeping of the commandments of God."Gal. 5:6; 6:15; 1 Cor.
   7:19.

   [467] The imperfect sunesthien meta ton ethnon, Gal. 2:12, indicates
   habit he used to eat with the uncircumcised Christians. This is the
   best proof from the pen of Paul himself that Peter agreed with him in
   principle and even in his usual practice. The eating refers, in all
   probability, not only to common meals, but also to the primitive
   love-feasts (agapae) and the holy communion, where brotherly
   recognition and fellowship is consummated and scaled.

   [468] Acts 10:27-29, 34, 35; 11:3: "thou wentest in to men
   uncircumcised and didst eat with them."

   [469] tines apo Iakobou, Gal, 2:12, seems to imply that they were sent
   by James (comp. Matt. 26:47; Mark 5:25; John 3:2), and not simply
   disciples of James or members of his congregation, which would be
   expressed by tines ton apo Iakobou. See Grimm, l.c., p. 427.

   [470] There are not a few examples of successful intimidations of
   strong and bold men. Luther was so frightened at the prospect of a
   split of the holy Catholic church, in an interview with the papal
   legate, Carl von Miltitz, at Altenburg in January, 1519, that he
   promised to write and did write a most humiliating letter of submission
   to the Pope, and a warning to the German people against secession. But
   the irrepressible conflict soon broke out again at the Leipzig
   disputation in June, 1519.

   [471] Gal 2:14-21. We take this section to be a brief outline of Paul's
   address to Peter; but the historical narrative imperceptibly passes
   into doctrinal reflections suggested by the occasion and adapted to the
   case of the Galatians. In the third chapter it naturally expands into a
   direct attack on the Galatians.

   [472] Paul draws, in the form of a question, a false conclusion of the
   Judaizing opponents from correct premises of his own, and rejects the
   conclusion with his usual formula of abhorrence, me genoito, as in Rom.
   6:2.

   [473] Gal. 2:11, Peter stood self-condemned and condemned by the
   Gentiles, kategnosmenos en, not " blameworthy," or " was to be
   blamed"(E. V.).

   [474] Comp. 1 Cor. 9:5, 6; 15:5; Col. 4:10; Philem. 24; 2 Tim. 4:11.

   [475] 1 Pet. 5:12; 2 Pet. 3:15, 16.

   [476] So Clement of Alexandria, and other fathers, also the Jesuit
   Harduin.

   [477] This monstrous perversion of Scripture was advocated even by such
   fathers as Origen, Jerome, and Chrysostom. It gave rise to a
   controversy between Jerome and Augustin, who from a superior moral
   sense protested against it, and prevailed.

   [478] Comp. 2 Cor, 4:7; Phil. 3:12; James 3:2; 1 John 1:8; 2:2.

   [479] Comp. Acts 21:17-20.

   [480] The E. V. translates huperlian apostoloi, 2 Cor. 11:5, "the very
   chiefest apostles," Plumptre better, "those apostles-extraordinary."
   They are identical with the pseudapostoloi, 11:13, and not with the
   pillar-apostles of the circumcision, Gal. 2:9; see above, p. 334, note
   1.

   [481] Augustin thus distinguishes three periods in the Mosaic law: 1,
   lex viva, sed non vivifica; 2, l. moribunda, sed non mortifera; 3, l.
   mortua et mortifera.

   The City of Rome.

   The city of Rome was to the Roman empire what Paris is to France, what
   London to Great Britain: the ruling head and the beating heart. It had
   even a more cosmopolitan character than these modern cities. It was the
   world in miniature, "orbis in urbe." Rome had conquered nearly all the
   nationalities of the then civilized world, and drew its population from
   the East and from the West, from the North and from the South. All
   languages, religious, and customs of the conquered provinces found a
   home there. Half the inhabitants spoke Greek, and the natives
   complained of the preponderance of this foreign tongue, which, since
   Alexander's conquest, had become the language of the Orient and of the
   civilized world. [482] The palace of the emperor was the chief centre
   of Oriental and Greek life. Large numbers of the foreigners were
   freedmen, who generally took the family name of their masters. Many of
   them became very wealthy, even millionnaires. The rich freedman was in
   that age the type of the vulgar, impudent, bragging upstart. According
   to Tacitus, "all things vile and shameful" were sure to flow from all
   quarters of the empire into Rome as a common sewer. But the same is
   true of the best elements: the richest products of nature, the rarest
   treasures of art, were collected there; the enterprising and ambitious
   youths, the men of genius, learning, and every useful craft found in
   Rome the widest field and the richest reward for their talents.

   With Augustus began the period of expensive building. In his long reign
   ofpeace and prosperity he changed the city of bricks into a city of
   marble. It extended in narrow and irregular streets on both banks of
   the Tiber, covered the now desolate and feverish Campagna to the base
   of the Albanian hills, and stretched its arms by land and by sea to the
   ends of the earth. It was then (as in its ruins it is even now) the
   most instructive and interesting city in the world. Poets, orators, and
   historians were lavish in the praises of the urbs aeterna,

   "qua nihil posis visere majus." [483]

   The estimates of the population of imperial Rome are guesswork, and
   vary from one to four millions. But in all probability it amounted
   under Augustus to more than a million, and increased rapidly under the
   following emperors till it received a check by the fearful epidemic of
   79, which for many days demanded ten thousand victims a day. [484]
   Afterwards the city grew again and reached the height of its splendor
   under Hadrian and the Antonines. [485]

   The Jews in Rome.

   The number of Jews in Rome during the apostolic age is estimated at
   twenty or thirty thousand souls. [486] They all spoke Hellenistic Greek
   with a strong Hebrew accent. They had, as far as we know, seven
   synagogues and three cemeteries, with Greek and a few Latin
   inscriptions, sometimes with Greek words in Latin letters, or Latin
   words with Greek letters. [487] They inhabited the fourteenth region,
   beyond the Tiber (Trastevere), at the base of the Janiculum, probably
   also the island of the Tiber, and part of the left bank towards the
   Circus Maximus and the Palatine hill, in the neighborhood of the
   present Ghetto or Jewry. They were mostly descendants of slaves and
   captives of Pompey, Cassius, and Antony. They dealt then, as now, in
   old clothing and broken ware, or rose from poverty to wealth and
   prominence as bankers, physicians, astrologers, and fortunetellers. Not
   a few found their way to the court. Alityrus, a Jewish actor, enjoyed
   the highest favor of Nero. Thallus, a Samaritan and freedman of
   Tiberius, was able to lend a million denarii to the Jewish king, Herod
   Agrippa. [488] The relations between the Herods and the Julian and
   Claudian emperors were very intimate.

   The strange manners and institutions of the Jews, as circumcision,
   Sabbath observance, abstinence from pork and meat sacrificed to the
   gods whom they abhorred as evil spirits, excited the mingled amazement,
   contempt, and ridicule of the Roman historians and satirists. Whatever
   was sacred to the heathen was profane to the Jews. [489] They were
   regarded as enemies of the human race. But this, after all, was a
   superficial judgment. The Jews had also their friends. Their
   indomitable industry and persistency, their sobriety, earnestness,
   fidelity and benevolence, their strict obedience to law, their
   disregard of death in war, their unshaken trust in God, their hope of a
   glorious future of humanity, the simplicity and purity of their
   worship, the sublimity and majesty of the idea of one omnipotent, holy,
   and merciful God, made a deep impression upon thoughtful and serious
   persons, and especially upon females (who escaped the odium of
   circumcision). Hence the large number of proselytes in Rome and
   elsewhere. Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, as well as Josephus, testify
   that many Romans abstained from all business on the Sabbath, fasted and
   prayed, burned lamps, studied the Mosaic law, and sent tribute to the
   temple of Jerusalem. Even the Empress Poppaea was inclined to Judaism
   after her own fashion, and showed great favor to Josephus, who calls
   her "devout" or "God-fearing" (though she was a cruel and shameless
   woman). [490] Seneca, who detested the Jews (calling them
   sceleratissima gens), was constrained to say that this conquered race
   gave laws to their conquerors. [491]

   The Jews were twice expelled from Rome under Tiberius and Claudius, but
   soon returned to their transtiberine quarter, and continued to enjoy
   the privileges of a religio licita, which were granted to them by
   heathen emperors, but were afterwards denied them by Christian popes.
   [492]

   When Paul arrived in Rome he invited the rulers of the synagogues to a
   conference, that he might show them his good will and give them the
   first offer of the gospel, but they replied to his explanations with
   shrewd reservation, and affected to know nothing of Christianity,
   except that it was a sect everywhere spoken against. Their best policy
   was evidently to ignore it as much as possible. Yet a large number came
   to hear the apostle on an appointed day, and some believed, while the
   majority, as usual, rejected his testimony. [493]

   Christianity in Rome.

   From this peculiar people came the first converts to a religion which
   proved more than a match for the power of Rome. The Jews were only an
   army of defense, the Christians an army of conquest, though under the
   despised banner of the cross.

   The precise origin of the church of Rome is involved in impenetrable
   mystery. We are informed of the beginnings of the church of Jerusalem
   and most of the churches of Paul, but we do not know who first preached
   the gospel at Rome. Christianity with its missionary enthusiasm for the
   conversion of the world must have found a home in the capital of the
   world at a very early day, before the apostles left Palestine. The
   congregation at Antioch grew up from emigrant and fugitive disciples of
   Jerusalem before it was consolidated and fully organized by Barnabas
   and Paul.

   It is not impossible, though by no means demonstrable, that the first
   tidings of the gospel were brought to Rome soon after the birthday of
   the church by witnesses of the pentecostal miracle in Jerusalem, among
   whom were "sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes." [494] In
   this case Peter, the preacher of the pentecostal sermon, may be said to
   have had an indirect agency in the founding of the church of Rome,
   which claims him as the rock on which it is built, although the
   tradition of his early visit (42) and twenty or twenty-five years'
   residence there is a long exploded fable. [495] Paul greets among the
   brethren in Rome some kinsmen who had been converted before him, i.e.,
   before 37. [496] Several names in the list of Roman brethren to whom he
   sends greetings are found in the Jewish cemetery on the Appian Way
   among the freedmen of the Empress Livia. Christians from Palestine,
   Syria, Asia Minor, and Greece must have come to the capital for various
   reasons, either as visitors or settlers.

   The Edict of Claudius.

   The first historic trace of Christianity in Rome we have in a notice of
   the heathen historian Suetonius, confirmed by Luke, that Claudius,
   about a.d. 52, banished the Jews from Rome because of their
   insurrectionary disposition and commotion under the instigation of
   "Chrestus" (misspelt for "Christus"). [497]

   This commotion in all probability refers to Messianic controversies
   between Jews and Christians who were not yet clearly distinguished at
   that time. The preaching, of Christ, the true King of Israel, would
   naturally produce a great commotion among the Jews, as it did at
   Antioch, in Pisidia, in Lystra, Thessalonica, and Beraea; and the
   ignorant heathen magistrates would as naturally infer that Christ was a
   political pretender and aspirant to an earthly throne. The Jews who
   rejected the true Messiah looked all the more eagerly for an imaginary
   Messiah that would break the yoke of Rome and restore the theocracy of
   David in Jerusalem. Their carnal millennarianism affected even some
   Christians, and Paul found it necessary to warn them against rebellion
   and revolution. Among those expelled by the edict of Claudius were
   Aquila and Priscilla, the hospitable friends of Paul, who were probably
   converted before they met him in Corinth. [498]

   The Jews, however, soon returned, and the Jewish Christians also, but
   both under a cloud of suspicion. To this fact Tacitus may refer when he
   says that the Christian superstition which had been suppressed for a
   time (by the edict of Claudius) broke out again (under Nero, who
   ascended the throne in 54).

   Paul's Epistle.

   In the early part of Nero's reign (54-68) the Roman congregation was
   already well known throughout Christendom, had several meeting places
   and a considerable number of teachers. [499] It was in view of this
   fact, and in prophetic anticipation of its future importance, that Paul
   addressed to it from Corinth his most important doctrinal Epistle (a.d.
   58), which was to prepare the way for his long desired personal visit.
   On his journey to Rome three years later he found Christians at Puteoli
   (the modern Puzzuolo at the bay of Naples), who desired him to tarry
   with them seven days. [500] Some thirty or forty miles from the city,
   at Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae (The Three Taverns), he was met by
   Roman brethren anxious to see the writer of that marvellous letter, and
   derived much comfort from this token of affectionate regard. [501]

   Paul in Rome.

   His arrival in Rome, early in the year 61, which two years later was
   probably followed by that of Peter, naturally gave a great impulse to
   the growth of the congregation. He brought with him, as he had
   promised, "the fulness of the blessing of Christ." His very bonds were
   overruled for the progress of the gospel, which he was left free to
   preach under military guard in his own dwelling. [502] He had with him
   during the whole or a part of the first Roman captivity his faithful
   pupils and companions: Luke, "the beloved physician" and historian;
   Timothy, the dearest of his spiritual sons; John Mark, who had deserted
   him on his first missionary tour, but joined him at Rome and mediated
   between him and Peter; one Jesus, who is called Justus, a Jewish
   Christian, who remained faithful to him; Aristarchus, his
   fellow-prisoner from Thessalonica; Tychicus from Ephesus; Epaphras and
   Onesimus from Colossae; Epaphroditus from Philippi; Demas, Pudens,
   Linus, Eubulus, and others who are honorably mentioned in the Epistles
   of the captivity. [503] They formed a noble band of evangelists and
   aided the aged apostle in his labors at Rome and abroad. On the other
   hand his enemies of the Judaizing party were stimulated to
   counter-activity, and preached Christ from envy and jealousy; but in
   noble self-denial Paul rose above petty sectarianism, and sincerely
   rejoiced from his lofty standpoint if only Christ was proclaimed and
   his kingdom promoted. While he fearlessly vindicated Christian freedom
   against Christian legalism in the Epistle to the Galatians, he
   preferred even a poor contracted Christianity to the heathenism which
   abounded in Rome. [504]

   The number which were converted through these various agencies, though
   disappearing in the heathen masses of the metropolis, and no doubt much
   smaller than the twenty thousand Jews, must have been considerable, for
   Tacitus speaks of a "vast multitude" of Christians that perished in the
   Neronian persecution in 64; and Clement, referring to the same
   persecution, likewise mentions a "vast multitude of the elect," who
   were contemporary with Paul and Peter, and who, "through many
   indignities and tortures, became a most noble example among ourselves"
   (that is, the Roman Christians). [505]

   Composition and Consolidation of the Roman Church.

   The composition of the church of Rome has been a matter of much learned
   controversy and speculation. It no doubt was, like most congregations
   outside of Palestine, of a mixed character, with a preponderance of the
   Gentile over the Jewish element, but it is impossible to estimate the
   numerical strength and the precise relation which the two elements
   sustained to each other. [506]

   We have no reason to suppose that it was at once fully organized and
   consolidated into one community. The Christians were scattered all over
   the immense city, and held their devotional meetings in different
   localities. The Jewish and the Gentile converts may have formed
   distinct communities, or rather two sections of one Christian
   community.

   Paul and Peter, if they met together in Rome (after 63), would
   naturally, in accordance with the Jerusalem compact, divide the field
   of supervision between them as far as practicable, and at the same time
   promote union and harmony. This may be the truth which underlies the
   early and general tradition that they were the joint founders of the
   Roman church. No doubt their presence and martyrdom cemented the Jewish
   and Gentile sections. But the final consolidation into one organic
   corporation was probably not effected till after the destruction of
   Jerusalem.

   This consolidation was chiefly the work of Clement, who appears as the
   first presiding presbyter of the one Roman church. He was admirably
   qualified to act as mediator between the disciples of Peter and Paul,
   being himself influenced by both, though more by Paul. His Epistle to
   the Corinthians combines the distinctive features of the Epistles of
   Paul, Peter, and James, and has been called "a typical document,
   reflecting the comprehensive principles and large sympathies which had
   been impressed upon the united church of Rome." [507]

   In the second century we see no more traces of a twofold community. But
   outside of the orthodox church, the heretical schools, both Jewish and
   Gentile, found likewise au early home in this rendezvous of the world.
   The fable of Simon Magus in Rome reflects this fact. Valentinus,
   Marcion, Praxeas, Theodotus, Sabellius, and other arch-heretics taught
   there. In heathen Rome, Christian heresies and sects enjoyed a
   toleration which was afterwards denied them by Christian Rome, until,
   in 1870, it became the capital of united Italy, against the protest of
   the pope.

   Language.

   The language of the Roman church at that time was the Greek, and
   continued to be down to the third century. In that language Paul wrote
   to Rome and from Rome; the names of the converts mentioned in the
   sixteenth chapter of the Romans, and of the early bishops, are mostly
   Greek; all the early literature of the Roman church was Greek; even the
   so-called Apostles' Creed, in the form held by the church of Rome, was
   originally Greek. The first Latin version of the Bible was not made for
   Rome, but for the provinces, especially for North Africa. The Greeks
   and Greek speaking Orientals were at that time the most intelligent,
   enterprising, and energetic people among the middle classes in Rome.
   "The successful tradesmen, the skilled artisans, the confidential
   servants and retainers of noble houses--almost all the activity and
   enterprise of the common people, whether for good or for evil, were
   Greek." [508]

   Social Condition.

   The great majority of the Christians in Rome, even down to the close of
   the second century, belonged to the lower ranks of society. They were
   artisans, freedmen, slaves. The proud Roman aristocracy of wealth,
   power, and knowledge despised the gospel as a vulgar superstition. The
   contemporary writers ignored it, or mentioned it only incidentally and
   with evident contempt. The Christian spirit and the old Roman spirit
   were sharply and irreconcilably antagonistic, and sooner or later had
   to meet in deadly conflict.

   But, as in Athens and Corinth, so there were in Rome also a few
   honorable exceptions.

   Paul mentions his success in the praetorian guard and in the imperial
   household. [509]

   It is possible, though not probable, that Paul became passingly
   acquainted with the Stoic philosopher, Annaeus Seneca, the teacher of
   Nero and friend of Burrus; for he certainly knew his brother, Annaeus
   Gallio, proconsul at Corinth, then at Rome, and had probably official
   relations with Burrus, as prefect of the praetorian guard, to which he
   was committed as prisoner; but the story of the conversion of Seneca,
   as well as his correspondence with Paul, are no doubt pious fictions,
   and, if true, would be no credit to Christianity, since Seneca, like
   Lord Bacon, denied his high moral principles by his avarice and
   meanness. [510]

   Pomponia Graecina, the wife of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror of
   Britain, who was arraigned for "foreign superstition" about the year 57
   or 58 (though pronounced innocent by her husband), and led a life of
   continual sorrow till her death in 83, was probably the first Christian
   lady of the Roman nobility, the predecessor of the ascetic Paula and
   Eustochium, the companions of Jerome. [511] Claudia and Pudens, from
   whom Paul sends greetings (2 Tim. 4:21), have, by an ingenious
   conjecture, been identified with the couple of that name, who are
   respectfully mentioned by Martial in his epigrams; but this is
   doubtful. [512] A generation later two cousins of the Emperor Domitian
   (81-96), T. Flavius Clemens, consul (in 95), and his wife, Flavia
   Domitilla, were accused of "atheism, " that is, of Christianity, and
   condemned, the husband to death, the wife to exile (a.d. 96). [513]
   Recent excavations in the catacomb of Domitilla, near that of
   Callistus, establish the fact that an entire branch of the Flavian
   family had embraced the Christian faith. Such a change was wrought
   within fifty or sixty years after Christianity had entered Rome. [514]

   [482] Friedländer, I. 372 sqq.

   [483] See some of these eulogistic descriptions in Friedländer, I. 9,
   who says that the elements which produced this overwhelming impression
   were "the enormous, ever changing turmoil of a population from all
   lands, the confusing and intoxicating commotion of a truly cosmopolitan
   intercourse, the number and magnificence of public parks and buildings,
   and the immeasurable extent of the city." Of the Campagna he says, p.
   10: "Wo sich jetzt eine ruinenerfüllte Einöde gegen das
   Albanesergebirge hinerstreckt, über der Fieberluft brütet, war damals
   eine durchaus gesunde, überall angebaute, von Leben wimmelden Strassen
   durchschnittene Ebene."See Strabo, v. 3, 12

   [484] Friedländer, I. 54 sqq., by a combination of certain data, comes
   to the conclusion that Rome numbered under Augustus (A. U. 749) 668,600
   people, exclusive of slaves, and 70 or 80 years later from one and a
   half to two millions.

   Jews in Rome under Augustus, 60,000 under Tiberius. We know from
   Josephus that 8,000 Roman Jews accompanied a deputation of King Herod
   to Augustus (Ant. XVII. 11, 1), and that 4,000 Jews were banished by
   Tiberius to the mines of Sardinia (XVIII. 3, 5; comp. Tacitus, Ann. II.
   85). But these data do not justify a very definite calculation.

   [490] "Poppaea Sabina, the wife of Otho, was the fairest woman of her
   time, and with the charms of beauty she combined the address of an
   accomplished intriguer. Among the dissolute women of imperial Rome she
   stands preëminent. Originally united to Rufius Crispinus, she allowed
   herself to be seduced by Otho, and obtained a divorce in order to marry
   him. Introduced by this new connection to the intimacy of Nero, she
   soon aimed at a higher elevation. But her husband was jealous and
   vigilant, and she herself knew how to allure the young emperor by
   alternate advances and retreats, till, in the violence of his passion,
   he put his friend out of the way by dismissing him to the government of
   Lusitania. Poppaea suffered Otho to depart without a sigh. She profited
   by his absence to make herself more than ever indispensable to her
   paramour, and aimed, with little disguise, at releasing herself from
   her union and supplanting Octavia, by divorce or even death." Merivale,
   Hist. of the Romans, VI. 97. Nero accidentally kicked Poppaea to death
   when in a state of pregnancy (65), and pronounced her eulogy from the
   rostrum. The senate decreed divine honors to her. Comp. Tac. Ann. XIII.

   Berenice, the daughter of King Agrippa, who had heard the story of
   Paul's conversion at Caesarea (Acts 25:13, 23), became the acknowledged
   mistress first of Vespasianus and then of his son Titus, and presided
   in the palace of the Caesars. Titus promised to marry her, but was

   adulteress. "Dimisit invitus invitam." Sueton. Tit., c. 7; Tacit.

   [492] The history of the Roman Ghetto (the word is derived from ?dg,
   caedo, to cut down, comp. Isa. 10:33; 14:12; 15:2; Jer. 48:25, 27,
   etc., presents a curious and sad chapter in the annals of the papacy.
   The fanatical Pope Paul IV. (1555-'59) caused it to be walled in and
   shut out from all intercourse with the Christian world, declaring in
   the bull Cum nimis: "It is most absurd and unsuitable that the Jews,
   whose own crime has plunged them into everlasting slavery, under the
   plea that Christian magnanimity allows them, should presume to dwell
   and mix with Christians, not bearing any mark of distinction, and
   should have Christian servants, yea even buy houses." Sixtus V. treated
   the Jews kindly on the plea that they were "the family from which
   Christ came;" but his successors, Clement VIII., Clement XI., and
   Innocent XIII., forbade them all trade except that in old clothes,
   rags, and iron. Gregory XIII. (1572-'85), who rejoiced over the
   massacre of St. Bartholomew, forced the Jews to hear a sermon every
   week, and on every Sabbath police agents were sent to the Ghetto to
   drive men, women, and children into the church with scourges, and to
   lash them if they paid no attention! This custom was only abolished by
   Pius IX., who revoked all the oppressive laws against the Jews. For
   this and other interesting information about the Ghetto see Augustus J.
   C. Hare, Walks in Rome, 1873, 165 sqq., and a pamphlet of Dr. Philip, a
   Protestant missionary among the Jews in Rome, On the Ghetto, Rome,

   Libertini, i.e., emancipated Roman Jews, descendants of those whom
   Pompey had carried captive to Rome, Acts 6:9.

   [495] Given up even by Roman Catholic historians in Germany, but still
   confidently reasserted by Drs. Northcote and Brownlow, l.c. I., p. 79,

   Italian band in 42. Comp. on this subject §26, pp. 254 sqq.

   [496] Rom. 16:7, "Salute Andronicus and Junias (or Junia), my kinsmen,
   and my fellow-prisoners who ... have been in Christ before me." If
   Junias is masculine, it must be a contraction from Junianus, as Lucas
   from Lucanus. But Chrysostom, Grotius, Reiche, and others take it as a
   female, either the wife or sister of Andronicus.

   [497] Sueton., Claud., c. 25: "Judaeos impulsore Chresto assidue
   tumultuantes Roma expulit." The Romans often confounded Christus (the
   Anointed) andChrestus (from chrestos, useful, good), and called the
   Christians chrestianoi, Chrestiani. Compare the French form chrétien.
   Justin Martyr uses this etymological error as an argument against the
   persecution of the Christians for the sake of their name. Apol. I., c.
   4 (I. p. 10, ed. Otto): Christianoi einai kategoroumetha, to de
   chreston miseisthai ou dikaion. He knew, however, the true origin of
   the name of Christ, I.c. 12: Iesous Christos, aph' ou kai to
   Christianoi eponomazesthai eschekamen . Tertullian says that the name
   Christus was almost invariably mispronounced Chrestus bythe heathen.
   Apol., c. 3; Ad Nat., I.3. This mistake continued to be made down to
   the fourth century, Lactantius, Instit. Div., IV. 7, and is found also
   in Latin inscriptions. Renan derives the name Christianus from the
   Latin (like Herodian, Matt. 22:16, Pompejani, Caesareani), as the
   derivation from the Greek would require Christeios (Les âpotres, p.
   234). Lightfoot denies this, and refers to Sardianos,
   Trallianos(Philippians, p.16, note 1); but Renan would regard these
   nouns as Latinisms like Asianos (Acts 20:4, Strabo, etc.). Antioch,
   where the name originated (Acts 11:26), had long before been Romanized
   and was famous for its love of nicknames. Renan thinks that the term
   originated with the Roman authority as an appellation de police. The
   other two passages of the N.T. in which it occurs, Acts 26:28; 1 Pet.
   4:16, seem to imply contempt and dislike, and so it is used by Tacitus
   and Suetonius. But what was originally meant by the heathen to be a
   name of derision has become the name of the highest honor. For what can
   be nobler and better than to be a true Christian, that is, a follower
   of Christ. It is a remarkable fact that the name " Jesuit,"which was
   not in use till the sixteenth century, has become, by the misconduct of
   the order which claimed it, a term of reproach even in Roman Catholic
   countries; while the term " Christian"embraces proverbially all that is
   noble, and good, and Christ-like.

   [498] Acts 18:2; Rom. 16:3. An unconverted Jew would not have taken the
   apostle under his roof and into partnership. The appellation .Ioudaios
   often signifies merely the nationality (comp. Gal. 2:13-15). The name
   Aquila, i.e., Eagle, Adler, is still common among Jews, like other high
   sounding animal names (Leo, Leopardus, Löwe, Löwenherz, Löwenstein,
   etc.). The Greek Akulas was a transliteration of the Latin, and is
   probably slightly altered in Onkelos, the traditional author of one of
   the Targums, whom the learned Emmanuel Deutsch identifies with Aquila
   (Akulas, slyq? in the Talmud), the Greek translator of the Old
   Testament, a convert to Judaism in the reign of Hadrian, and supposed
   nephew of the emperor. Liter. Remains (N. York, 1874), pp. 337-340. The
   name of his wife, Priscilla (the diminutive form of Prisca), " probably
   indicates a connection with the gens of the Prisci, who appear in the
   earliest stages of Roman history, and supplied a long series of
   praetors and consuls." Plumptre on Acts, 18:2.

   town of more importance, mentioned in Cicero's letters, and probably
   located on the junction of the road from Antium with the Via Appia,
   near the modern Cisterna. The distances from Rome southward are given
   in the Antonine Itinerary as follows: "to Aricia, 16 miles; to Tres

   [506] Comp. my Hist. Ap. Ch., p. 296 sqq. Dr. Baur attempted to
   revolutionize the traditional opinion of the preponderance of the
   Gentile element, and to prove that the Roman church consisted almost
   exclusively of Jewish converts, and that the Epistle to the Romans is a
   defense of Pauline universalism against Petrine particularism. He was
   followed by Schwegler, Reuss, Mangold, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, Holsten,
   Holtzmann., and also to some extent by Thiersch and Sabatier. But he
   was opposed by Olshausen, Tholuck, Philippi, De Wette, Meyer, Schott,
   Hofmann, in favor of the other view. Beyschlag proposed a compromise to
   the effect that the majority, in conformity with Paul's express
   statements, were Gentile Christians, but mostly ex-proselytes, and
   hence shared Judaizing convictions. This view has been approved by
   Schürer and Schultz. Among the latest and ablest discussions are those
   of Weizsäcker and Godet, who oppose the views both of Baur and
   Beyschlag. The original nucleus was no doubt Jewish, but the Gentile
   element soon outgrew it, as is evident from the Epistle itself, from
   the last chapter of Acts, from the Neronian persecution, and other
   facts. Paul had a right to regard the Roman congregation as belonging
   to his own field of labor. The Judaizing tendency was not wanting, as
   we see from the 14th and 15th chapters, and from allusions in the
   Philippians and Second Timothy, but it had not the character of a
   bitter personal antagonism to Paul, as in Galatia, although in the
   second century we find also a malignant type of Ebionism in Rome, where
   all heretics congregated.

   the Columbaria of the imperial household on the Appian way. Comp.
   Lightfoot, Philipp., p. 169 sqq., Plumptre, Excursus to his Com. on
   Acts, and Harnack, l.c., pp. 258 sq. Harnack makes it appear that the
   two trusty servants of the Roman church, Claudius Ephebus and Valerius
   Bito, mentioned in the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, c. 63,
   belonged to the household of the emperor Claudius.

   [510] See above, § 29, p. 279, especially the essay of Lightfoot quoted
   there. Harnack (l.c., p. 260) and Friedländer regard the acquaintance
   of Paul with Seneca as very improbable, Plumptre as probable. An
   epitaph from the third century was found in Ostia which reads: D M. M.
   Anneo. Paulo. Petro. M. Anneus. Paulus. Filio. Carissimo. See De Rossi
   in the Bullet. di archeol. christ., 1867, pp. 6 sq., and Renan,
   L'Antechrist, p. 12. Seneca belonged to the gens Annaea. But all that
   the inscription can be made to prove is that a Christian member of the
   gens Annaea in the third century bore the name of "Paul," and called
   his son "Paulus Petrus," a combination familiar to Christiana, but
   unknown to the heathen. Comp, Friedländer, III. 535.

   [511] Here Christianity has been inferred from the vague description of
   Tacitus, Ann. XIII. 32. See Friedländer III. 534; Lightfoot, p. 21;
   Northcote and Brownlow, I. 82 sq. Harnack, p. 263. The inference is
   confirmed by the discovery of the gravestone of a Pomponius Graecinus
   and other members of the same family, in the very ancient crypt of
   Lucina, near the catacomb of St. Callistus. De Rossi conjectures that
   Lucina was the Christian name of Pomponia Graecina. But Renan doubts
   this, L'Antech., p. 4, note 2.

   The preaching of Paul and Peter in Rome was an epoch in the history of
   the church. It gave an impulse to the growth of Christianity. Their
   martyrdom was even more effective in the end: it cemented the bond of
   union between the Jewish and Gentile converts, and consecrated the soil
   of the heathen metropolis. Jerusalem crucified the Lord, Rome beheaded
   and crucified his chief apostles and plunged the whole Roman church
   into a baptism of blood. Rome became, for good and for evil, the
   Jerusalem of Christendom, and the Vatican hill the Golgotha of the
   West. Peter and Paul, like a new Romulus and Remus, laid the foundation
   of a spiritual empire vaster and more enduring than that of the
   Caesars. The cross was substituted for the sword as the symbol of
   conquest and power. [515]

   But the change was effected at the sacrifice of precious blood. The
   Roman empire was at first, by its laws of justice, the protector of
   Christianity, without knowing its true character, and came to the
   rescue of Paul on several critical occasions, as in Corinth through the
   Proconsul Annaeus Gallio, in Jerusalem through the Captain Lysias, and
   in Caesarea through the Procurator Festus. But now it rushed into
   deadly conflict with the new religion, and opened, in the name of
   idolatry and patriotism, a series of intermittent persecutions, which
   ended at last in the triumph of the banner of the cross at the Milvian
   bridge. Formerly a restraining power that kept back for a while the
   outbreak of Antichrist, [516] it now openly assumed the character of
   Antichrist with fire and sword. [517]

   Nero.

   The first of these imperial persecutions with which the Martyrdom of
   Peter and Paul is connected by ecclesiastical tradition, took place in
   the tenth year of Nero's reign, a.d. 64, and by the instigation of that
   very emperor to whom Paul, as a Roman citizen, had appealed from the
   Jewish tribunal. It was, however, not a strictly religious persecution,
   like those under the later emperors; it originated in a public calamity
   which was wantonly charged upon the innocent Christians.

   A greater contrast can hardly be imagined than that between Paul, one
   of the purest and noblest of men, and Nero, one of the basest and
   vilest of tyrants. The glorious first five years of Nero's reign
   (54-59) under the wise guidance of Seneca and Burrhus, make the other
   nine (59-68) only more hideous by contrast. We read his life with
   mingled feelings of contempt for his folly, and horror of his
   wickedness. The world was to him a comedy and a tragedy, in which he
   was to be the chief actor. He had an insane passion for popular
   applause; he played on the lyre; he sung his odes at supper; he drove
   his chariots in the circus; he appeared as a mimic on the stage, and
   compelled men of the highest rank to represent in dramas or in tableaux
   the obscenest of the Greek myths. But the comedian was surpassed by the
   tragedian. He heaped crime upon crime until he became a proverbial
   monster of iniquity. The murder of his brother (Britannicus), his
   mother (Agrippina), his wives (Octavia and Poppaea), his teacher
   (Seneca), and many eminent Romans, was fitly followed by his suicide in
   the thirty-second year of his age. With him the family of Julius Caesar
   ignominiously perished, and the empire became the prize of successful
   soldiers and adventurers. [518]

   The Conflagration in Rome.

   For such a demon in human shape, the murder of a crowd of innocent
   Christians was pleasant sport. The occasion of the hellish spectacle
   was a fearful conflagration of Rome, the most destructive and
   disastrous that ever occurred in history. It broke out in the night
   between the 18th and 19th of July, [519] among the wooden shops in the
   south-eastern end of the Great Circus, near the Palatine hill. [520]
   Lashed by the wind, it defied all exertions of the firemen and
   soldiers, and raged with unabated fury for seven nights and six days.
   [521] Then it burst out again in another part, near the field of Mars,
   and in three days more laid waste two other districts of the city.
   [522]

   The calamity was incalculable. Only four of the fourteen regions into
   which the city was divided, remained uninjured; three, including the
   whole interior city from the Circus to the Esquiline hill, were a
   shapeless mass of ruins; the remaining seven were more or less
   destroyed; venerable temples, monumental buildings of the royal,
   republican, and imperial times, the richest creations of Greek art
   which had been collected for centuries, were turned into dust and
   ashes; men and beasts perished in the flames, and the metropolis of the
   world assumed the aspect of a graveyard with a million of mourners over
   the loss of irreparable treasures.

   This fearful catastrophe must have been before the mind of St. John in
   the Apocalypse when he wrote his funeral dirge of the downfall of
   imperial Rome (Apoc. 18).

   The cause of the conflagration is involved in mystery. Public rumor
   traced it to Nero, who wished to enjoy the lurid spectacle of burning
   Troy, and to gratify his ambition to rebuild Rome on a more magnificent
   scale, and to call it Neropolis. [523] When the fire broke out he was
   on the seashore at Antium, his birthplace; he returned when the
   devouring element reached his own palace, and made extraordinary
   efforts to stay and then to repair the disaster by a reconstruction
   which continued till after his death, not forgetting to replace his
   partially destroyed temporary residence (domus transitoria) by "the
   golden house" (domus aurea), as a standing wonder of architectural
   magnificence and extravagance.

   The Persecution of the Christians.

   To divert from himself the general suspicion of incendiarism, and at
   the same time to furnish new entertainment for his diabolical cruelty,
   Nero wickedly cast the blame upon the hated Christians, who, meanwhile,
   especially since the public trial of Paul and his successful labors in
   Rome, had come to be distinguished from the Jews as a genus tertium, or
   as the most dangerous offshoot from that race. They were certainly
   despisers of the Roman gods and loyal subjects of a higher king than
   Caesar, and they were falsely suspected of secret crimes. The police
   and people, under the influence of the panic created by the awful
   calamity, were ready to believe the worst slanders, and demanded
   victims. What could be expected of the ignorant multitude, when even
   such cultivated Romans as Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny, stigmatized
   Christianity as a vulgar and pestiferous superstition. It appeared to
   them even worse than Judaism, which was at least an ancient national
   religion, while Christianity was novel, detached from any particular
   nationality, and aiming at universal dominion. Some Christians were
   arrested, confessed their faith, and were "convicted not so much," says
   Tacitus, "of the crime of incendiarism as of hating the human race."
   Their Jewish origin, their indifference to politics and public affairs,
   their abhorrence of heathen customs, were construed into an "odium
   generis humani," and this made an attempt on their part to destroy the
   city sufficiently plausible to justify a verdict of guilty. An
   infuriated mob does not stop to reason, and is as apt to run mad as an
   individual.

   Under this wanton charge of incendiarism, backed by the equally
   groundless charge of misanthropy and unnatural vice, there began a
   carnival of blood such as even heathen Rome never saw before or since.
   [524] It was the answer of the powers of hell to the mighty preaching
   of the two chief apostles, which had shaken heathenism to its centre. A
   "vast multitude" of Christians was put to death in the most shocking
   manner. Some were crucified, probably in mockery of the punishment of
   Christ, [525] some sewed up in the skins of wild beasts and exposed to
   the voracity of mad dogs in the arena. The satanic tragedy reached its
   climax at night in the imperial gardens on the slope of the Vatican
   (which embraced, it is supposed, the present site of the place and
   church of St. Peter): Christian men and women, covered with pitch or
   oil or resin, and nailed to posts of pine, were lighted and burned as
   torches for the amusement of the mob; while Nero, in fantastical dress,
   figured in a horse race, and displayed his art as charioteer. Burning
   alive was the ordinary punishment of incendiaries; but only the cruel
   ingenuity of this imperial monster, under the inspiration of the devil,
   could invent such a horrible system of illumination.

   This is the account of the greatest heathen historian, the fullest we
   have--as the best description of the destruction of Jerusalem is from
   the pen of the learned Jewish historian. Thus enemies bear witness to
   the truth of Christianity. Tacitus incidentally mentions in this
   connection the crucifixion of Christ under Pontius Pilate, in the reign
   of Tiberius. With all his haughty Roman contempt for the Christians
   whom he knew only from rumor and reading, he was convinced of their
   innocence of incendiarism, and notwithstanding his cold stoicism, he
   could not suppress a feeling of pity for them because they were
   sacrificed not to the public good, but to the ferocity of a wicked
   tyrant.

   Some historians have doubted, not indeed the truth of this terrible
   persecution, but that the Christians, rather than the Jews, or the
   Christians alone, were the sufferers. It seems difficult to understand
   that the harmless and peaceful Christians, whom the contemporary
   writers, Seneca, Pliny, Lucan, Persius, ignore, while they notice the
   Jews, should so soon have become the subjects of popular indignation.
   It is supposed that Tacitus and Suetonius, writing some fifty years
   after the event, confounded the Christians with the Jews, who were
   generally obnoxious to the Romans, and justified the suspicion of
   incendiarism by the escape of their transtiberine quarter from the
   injury of the fire. [526]

   But the atrocious act was too public to leave room for such a mistake.
   Both Tacitus and Suetonius distinguish the two sects, although they
   knew very little of either; and the former expressly derives the name
   Christians from Christ, as the founder of the new religion. Moreover
   Nero, as previously remarked, was not averse to the Jews, and his
   second wife, Poppaea Sabina, a year before the conflagration, had shown
   special favor to Josephus, and loaded him with presents. Josephus
   speaks of the crimes of Nero, but says not a word of any persecution of
   his fellow-religionists. [527] This alone seems to be conclusive. It is
   not unlikely that in this (as in all previous persecutions, and often
   afterwards) the fanatical Jews, enraged by the rapid progress of
   Christianity, and anxious to avert suspicion from themselves, stirred
   up the people against the hated Galilaeans, and that the heathen Romans
   fell with double fury on these supposed half Jews, disowned by their
   own strange brethren. [528]

   The Probable Extent of the Persecution.

   The heathen historians, if we are to judge from their silence, seem to
   confine the persecution to the city of Rome, but later Christian
   writers extend it to the provinces. [529] The example set by the
   emperor in the capital could hardly be without influence in the
   provinces, and would justify the outbreak of popular hatred. If the
   Apocalypse was written under Nero, or shortly after his death, John's
   exile to Patmos must be connected with this persecution. It mentions
   imprisonments in Smyrna, the martyrdom of Antipas in Pergamus, and
   speaks of the murder of prophets and saints and all that have been
   slain on the earth. [530] The Epistle to the Hebrews 10:32-34, which
   was written in Italy, probably in the year 64, likewise alludes to
   bloody persecutions, and to the release of Timothy from prison, 13:23.
   And Peter, in his first Epistle, which may be assigned to the same
   year, immediately after the outbreak of the persecution, and shortly
   before his death, warns the Christians in Asia Minor of a fiery trial
   which is to try them, and of sufferings already endured or to be
   endured, not for any crime, but for the name of "Christians." [531] The
   name "Babylon" [532] for Rome is most easily explained by the time and
   circumstances of composition.

   Christianity, which had just reached the age of its founder, seemed
   annihilated in Rome. With Peter and Paul the first generation of
   Christians was buried. Darkness must have overshadowed the trembling
   disciples, and a despondency seized them almost as deep as on the
   evening of the crucifixion, thirty-four years before. But the morning
   of the resurrection was not far distant, and the very spot of the
   martyrdom of St. Peter was to become the site of the greatest church in
   Christendom and the palatial residence of his reputed successors. [533]

   The Apocalypse on the Neronian Persecution.

   None of the leading apostles remained to record the horrible massacre,
   except John. He may have heard of it in Ephesus, or he may have
   accompanied Peter to Rome and escaped a fearful death in the Neronian
   gardens, if we are to credit the ancient tradition of his miraculous
   preservation from being burnt alive with his fellow-Christians in that
   hellish illumination on the Vatican hill. [534] At all events he was
   himself a victim of persecution for the name of Jesus, and depicted its
   horrors, as an exile on the lonely island of Patmos in the vision of
   the Apocalypse.

   This mysterious book--whether written between 68 and 69, or under
   Domitian in 95--was undoubtedly intended for the church of that age as
   well as for future ages, and must have been sufficiently adapted to the
   actual condition and surroundings of its first readers to give them
   substantial aid and comfort in their fiery trials. Owing to the
   nearness of events alluded to, they must have understood it even
   better, for practical purposes, than readers of later generations. John
   looks, indeed, forward to the final consummation, but he sees the end
   in the beginning. He takes his standpoint on the historic foundation of
   the old Roman empire in which he lived, as the visions of the prophets
   of Israel took their departure from the kingdom of David or the age of
   the Babylonian captivity. He describes the heathen Rome of his day as
   "the beast that ascended out of the abyss," as "a beast coming out of
   the sea, having ten horns and seven heads" (or kings, emperors), as
   "the great harlot that sitteth among many waters," as a "woman sitting
   upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven
   heads and ten horns," as "Babylon the great, the mother of the harlots
   and of the abominations of the earth." [535] The seer must have in view
   the Neronian persecution, the most cruel that ever occurred, when he
   calls the woman seated on seven hills, "drunken with the blood of the
   saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus," [536] and
   prophesied her downfall as a matter of rejoicing for the "saints and
   apostles and prophets." [537]

   Recent commentators discover even a direct allusion to Nero, as
   expressing in Hebrew letters (Neron Kesar) the mysterious number 666,
   and as being the fifth of the seven heads of the beast which was
   slaughtered, but would return again from the abyss as Antichrist. But
   this interpretation is uncertain, and in no case can we attribute to
   John the belief that Nero would literally rise from the dead as
   Antichrist. He meant only that Nero, the persecutor of the Christian
   church, was (like Antiochus Epiphanes) the forerunner of Antichrist,
   who would be inspired by the same bloody spirit from the infernal
   world. In a similar sense Rome was a second Babylon, and John the
   Baptist another Elijah.

   Notes.

   I. The Accounts of the Neronian Persecution.

   1. From heathen historians.

   We have chiefly two accounts of the first imperial persecution, from
   Tacitus, who was born about eight years before the event, and probably
   survived Trajan (d. 117), and from Suetonius, who wrote his XII.
   Caesares a little later, about a.d. 120. Dion Cassius (born circa a.d.
   155), in his History of Rome (Rhomaike Istoria, preserved in fragments,
   and in the abridgment of the monk Xiphilinus), from the arrival of
   Aeneas to a.d. 229, mentions the conflagration of Rome, but ignores the
   persecutions of the Christians.

   The description of Tacitus is in his terse, pregnant, and graphic
   style, and beyond suspicion of interpolation, but has some obscurities.
   We give it in full, from Annal., XV. 44

   "But not all the relief of men, nor the bounties of the emperor, nor
   the propitiation of the gods, could relieve him [Nero] from the infamy
   of being believed to have ordered the conflagration. Therefore, in
   order to suppress the rumor, Nero falsely charged with the guilt, and
   punished with the most exquisite tortures, those persons who, hated for
   their crimes, were commonly called Christians (subdidit reos, et
   quaesitissimis poenis affecit, quos per flagitia invisos vulgus
   'Christianos' appellabat). The founder of that name, Christus, had been
   put to death (supplicio affectus erat) by the procurator of Judaea,
   Pontius Pilate, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious
   superstition (exitiabilis superstitio), repressed for a time, [538]
   broke out again, not only through Judaea, the source of this evil, but
   also through the city [of Rome], whither all things vile and shameful
   flow from all quarters, and are encouraged (quo cuncta undique atrocia
   aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque). Accordingly, first, those only
   were arrested who confessed. [539] Next, on their information, a vast
   multitude (multitudo ingens), were convicted, not so much of the crime
   of incendiarism as of hatred of the human race (odio humani generis).
   [540] And in their deaths they were made the subjects of sport; for
   they were wrapped in the hides of wild beasts and torn to pieces by
   dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set on fire, and when day declined, were
   burned to serve for nocturnal lights (in usum nocturni luminis
   urerentur). Nero had offered his own gardens [on the Vatican] for this
   spectacle, and also exhibited a chariot race on the occasion, now
   mingling in the crowd in the dress of a charioteer, now actually
   holding the reins. Whence a feeling of compassion arose towards the
   sufferers, though justly held to be odious, because they seemed not to
   be cut off for the public good, but as victims to the ferocity of one
   man."

   The account of Suetonius, Nero, c. 16, is very short and
   unsatisfactory: "Afflicti suppliciis Christiani, genus hominum
   superstitionis novae ac maleficaea." He does not connect the
   persecution with the conflagration, but with police regulations.

   Juvenal, the satirical poet, alludes, probably as an eye-witness, to
   the persecution, like Tacitus, with mingled feelings of contempt and
   pity for the Christian sufferers (Sat. I. 155):


   "Dar'st thou speak of Tigellinus' guilt?

   Thou too shalt shine like those we saw

   Stand at the stake with throat transfixed

   Smoking and burning."

   2. From Christians.

   Clement of Rome, near the close of the first century, must refer to the
   Neronian persecution when he writes of the "vast multitude of the elect
   "who suffered, many indignities and tortures, being the victims of
   jealousy; "and of Christian women who were made to personate "Danaides"
   and "Dirces," Ad Corinth., c. 6. I have made no use of this passage in
   the text. Renan amplifies and weaves it into his graphic description of
   the persecution (L'Antechrist, pp. 163 sqq., almost literally repeated
   in his Hibbert Lectures). According to the legend, Dirce was bound to a
   raging bull and dragged to death. The scene is represented in the
   famous marble group in the museum at Naples. But the Danaides can
   furnish no suitable parallel to Christian martyrs, unless, as Renan
   suggests, Nero had the sufferings of the Tartarus represented.
   Lightfoot, following the bold emendation of Wordsworth (on Theocritus,
   XXVI. 1), rejects the reading Danaides kai Dirkai(which is retained in
   all editions, including that of Gebhardt and Harnack), and substitutes
   for it neanides, paidiskai, so that Clement would say:, Matrons
   (gunaikes) maidens, slave-girls, being persecuted, after suffering
   cruel and unholy insults, safely reached the goal in the race of faith,
   and received a noble reward, feeble though they were in body."

   Tertullian (d. about 220) thus alludes to the Neronian persecution, Ad
   Nationes, I. ch. 7: "This name of ours took its rise in the reign of
   Augustus; under Tiberius it was taught with all clearness and
   publicity; under Nero it was ruthlessly condemned (sub Nerone damnatio
   invaluit), and you may weigh its worth and character even from the
   person of its persecutor. If that prince was a pious man, then the
   Christians are impious; if he was just, if he was pure, then the
   Christians are unjust and impure; if he was not a public enemy, we are
   enemies of our country: what sort of men we are, our persecutor himself
   shows, since he of course punished what produced hostility to himself.
   Now, although every other institution which existed under Nero has been
   destroyed, yet this of ours has firmly remained--righteous, it would
   seem, as being unlike the author [of its persecution]."

   Sulpicius Severus, Chron. II. 28, 29, gives a pretty full account, but
   mostly from Tacitus. He and Orosius (Hist. VII. 7) first clearly assert
   that Nero extended the persecution to the provinces.

   II. Nero's Return as Antichrist.

   Nero, owing to his youth, beauty, dash, and prodigality, and the
   startling novelty of his wickedness (Tacitus calls him "incredibilium
   cupitor," Ann. XV. 42), enjoyed a certain popularity with the vulgar
   democracy of Rome. Hence, after his suicide, a rumor spread among the
   heathen that he was not actually dead, but had fled to the Parthians,
   and would return to Rome with an army and destroy the city. Three
   impostors under his name used this belief and found support during the
   reigns of Otho, Titus, and Domitian. Even thirty years later Domitian
   trembled at the name of Nero. Tacit., Hist. I. 2; II. 8, 9; Sueton.,
   Ner. 57; Dio Cassius, LXIV. 9; Schiller, l.c., p. 288.

   Among the Christians the rumor assumed a form hostile to Nero.
   Lactantius (De Mort. Persecut., c. 2) mentions the Sibylline saying
   that, as Nero was the first persecutor, he would also be the last, and
   precede the advent of Antichrist. Augustin (De Civil. Dei, XX. 19)
   mentions that at his time two opinions were still current in the church
   about Nero: some supposed that he would rise from the dead as
   Antichrist, others that he was not dead, but concealed, and would live
   until he should be revealed and restored to his kingdom. The former is
   the Christian, the latter the heathen belief. Augustin rejects both.
   Sulpicius Severus (Chron., II. 29) also mentions the belief (unde
   creditur) that Nero, whose deadly wound was healed, would return at the
   end of the world to work out "the mystery of lawlessness" predicted by
   Paul (2 Thess. 2:7).

   Some commentators make the Apocalypse responsible for this absurd rumor
   and false belief, while others hold that the writer shared it with his
   heathen contemporaries. The passages adduced are Apoc. 17:8: "The beast
   was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go
   into perdition" ... "the beast was, and is not, and shall be present"
   (kai parestai, notkaiper estin, "and yet is," as the E. V. reads with
   the text. ec.); 17:11: "And the beast that was, and is not, is himself
   also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition;" and
   13:3: "And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto
   death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole world wondered
   after the beast."

   But this is said of the beast, i.e., the Roman empire, which is
   throughout clearly distinguished from the seven heads, i.e., the
   emperors. In Daniel, too, the beast is collective. Moreover, a
   distinction must be made between the death of one ruler (Nero) and the
   deadly wound which thereby was inflicted on the beast or the empire,
   but from which it recovered (under Vespasian).

   Judaism was centralized in Jerusalem, the theocratic city of God (the
   holy city, the murderer of the prophets), so was heathen Rome, the
   humanitarian metropolis of the world, the centre of all the elements of
   light and darkness prevalent in the heathen world; and so did Christian
   Rome become the centre of all the elements of vital light, and of all
   the antichristian darkness in the Christian church. Hence Rome, like
   Jerusalem, not only possesses a unique historical significance, but is
   a universal picture operative through all ages. Christian Rome,
   especially, stands forth as a shining light of the nations, which is
   turned into an idol of magical strength to those who are subject to its
   rule."

   [516] In 2 Thess. 2:6, 7, to katechon is the Roman empire, ho katechon
   the emperor as its representative. This is the patristic interpretation
   to which some of the beat modern commentators have returned. Mediaeval
   sects and many Protestant writers found the great apostacy in the
   Papacy and the restraining power in the German empire; while papal
   commentators took revenge by fastening the charge of apostacy on the
   Reformation which was restrained by the Papacy. I believe in a repeated
   and growing fulfilment of this and other prophecies on the historic
   basis of the apostolic age and the old Roman empire.

   [517] It is so represented in the Apocalypse 13 -18 after the Neronian
   persecution.

   [518] Comp. Renan's portraiture of Nero, l.c. ch. I. He thinks that
   there is no parallel to this monster, and calls him un esprit
   prodigieusement déclamatoire, une mauvaise nature, hypocrite, légère,
   vaniteuse; un composé incroyable d'intelligence fausse, de méchanceté
   profonde, d'égoïsme atroce et sournois, avee des raffinements inouïs de
   subtilité."See also the description of Merivale, ch. LV. (vol. VI. 245
   sqq.).

   [519] Tacitus (Ann. XV. 41) gives the date quarto decimo [ante]
   Kalendas Sextiles ... quo et Senones captam urbem inflammaverant.
   Friedländer, I. 6, wrongly makes it the 17th July. The coincidence with
   the day when the Gauls had set fire to Rome (July 19, A. U. 364, or 453
   years before), was considered a bad omen. It was in the tenth year of
   Nero's reign, ie., a.d. 64. See Clinton, Fasti Romani, I. Oxon. 1845,
   pp. 45, 46; Friedländer, l.c. I. 6; Schiller, l.c. pp. 173 sq.;
   Merivale, VI. 131, note. Eusebius, in his Chronicle, erroneously puts
   the fire in the year 66.

   [520] For a description of the Circus Maximus see Friedländer, III. 293
   sqq. The amphitheatrical rows of seats were eight stadia long, with
   accommodation for 150,000 persons. After Nero's reconstruction the
   seats amounted to 250,000 under Vespasianum, and subsequent additions
   raised the number, in the fourth century to 385,000. It was surrounded
   by wooden buildings for shopkeepers (among whom were many Jews),
   astrologers, caterers, prostitutes, and all sorts of amusements. Nero
   was most extravagant in his expenditure for the circus and the theatre
   to gratify the people's passion for Panem et Circenses, to use
   Juvenal's words.

   [521] "Per sex dies septemque noctes," Sueton. Nero, 38 sex
   dies,"Tacit. Ann. XV. 4

   [522] The nine days' duration is proved by an inscription (Gruter, 61.
   3). The great fire in London in 1666 lasted only four days and swept an
   area of 436 acres. Comp. Lambert's Hist. of London,II. 91, quoted by
   Merivale. The fire in Chicago lasted only thirty-six hours, October 8
   and 9, 1871, but swept over nearly three and one-third square miles
   (2,114 square acres), and destroyed 17,450 buildings, the homes of
   98,500 people.

   [523] Tacitus XV. 39: "Pervaserat rumor ipso tempore flagrantis urbis
   inisse eum domesticam scenam et cecinisse Troianum excedium." Sueton.
   c. 38: "Quasi offensus deformitate veterum aedificiorum et angustiis
   flexurisque vicorum [Nero]incendit Urbem ... Hoc incendium e turre
   Maecenatiana prospectans, laetusque 'flammae,'ut ajebat,
   'pulchritudine,'halosin Ilii in illo suo scaenico habitu
   decantavit."Robbers and ruffians were seen to thrust blazing brands
   into the buildings, and, when seized, they affirmed that they acted
   under higher orders. The elder Pliny, Xiphilinus, and the author of the
   tragedy, Octavia, likewise charge Nero with incendiarism. But Schiller,
   l.c. 425 sqq., labors to relieve him of it.

   [524] We do not know the precise date of the massacre. Mosheim fixes it
   on November, Renan on August, a.d. 64. Several weeks or months at all
   events must have passed after the fire. If the traditional date of
   Peter's crucifixion be correct there would be an interval of nearly a
   year between the conflagration, July 19, 64, and his martyrdom, June
   29th.

   [525] "Crucibus affixi," says Tacitus. This would well apply to Peter,
   to whom our Lord had prophesied such a death, John 21:18, 19.
   Tertullian says:"Romae Petrus passioni Dominicae adaequatur"(De
   Praescript. Haeret., c. 36; comp. Adv. Marc., IV. 5; Scorpiace, 15).
   According to a later tradition he was, at his own request, crucified
   with his head downwards, deeming himself unworthy to be crucified as
   was his Lord. This is first mentioned in the Acta Pauli, c. 81, by
   Origen (in Euseb. H. E., III. 1) and more clearly by Jerome (Catal. 1);
   but is doubtful, although such cruelties were occasionally practised
   (see Josephus, Bell. Jud., V. 11, 1). Tradition mentions also the
   martyrdom of Peter's wife, who was cheered by the apostle on her way to
   the place of execution and exhorted to remember the Lord on the cross
   (memneso tou Kuriou). Clement of Alexandria, Strom. VII. 11, quoted by
   Eusebius, H. E., III. 30. The orderly execution of Paul by the sword
   indicates a regular legal process before, or more probably at least a
   year after, the Neronian persecution in which his Roman citizenship
   would scarcely have been respected. See p. 326.

   [526] So Gibbon (ch. XVI.), more recently Merivale, l.c. ch. 54 (vol.
   VI. 220, 4th ed.), and Schiller, l.c., pp. 434, 585, followed by
   Hausrath and Stahr. Merivale and Schiller assume that the persecution
   was aimed at the Jews and Christians indiscriminately. Guizot, Milman,
   Neander, Gieseler, Renan, Lightfoot, Wieseler, and Keim defend or
   assume the accuracy of Tacitus and Suetonius.

   [527] Ant. XX. 8, 2, 3.

   [528] So Ewald. VI. 627, and Renan, L'Antechist, pp. 159 sqq. Renan
   ingeniously conjectures that the "jealousy" to which Clement of Rome
   (Ad Cor. 6) traces the persecution, refers to the divisions among the
   Jews about the Christian religion.

   [529] Orosius (about 400), Hist., VII. 7: "Primus Romae Christianos
   suppliciis et mortibus adferit [Nero],ac per omnes provincias pari
   persecutione excruciari imperavit."So also Sulpicius Severus, Chron.
   II. 29. Dodwell (Dissert. Cypr. XI., De Paucitate martyrum, Gibbon,
   Milman, Merivale, and Schiller (p. 438) deny, but Ewald (VI. 627, and
   in his Com. on the Apoc.)and Renan (p. 183) very decidedly affirm the
   extension of the persecution beyond Rome. "L'atrocité commandée par
   Néron,"says Renan, "dut avor des contre-coups dans les provinces et y
   exciter une recrudescence de persécution." C. L. Roth (Werke des
   Tacitus, VI. 117) and Wieseler (Christenverfolgungen der Cäsaren, p.
   11) assume that Nero condemned and prohibited Christianity as dangerous
   to the state. Kiessling and De Rossi have found in an inscription at
   Pompeii traces of a bloody persecution; but the reading is dispated,
   see Schiller, p. 438, Friedländer III. 529, and Renan, p. 184.

   [530] Apoc. 2:9, 10, 13; 16:6; 17:6; 18:24.

   [532] At the close, 1 Pet. 5:13. not on page 384

   [533] "Those who survey," says Gibbon (ch. XVI.)."with a curious eye
   the revolutions of mankind, may observe that the gardens and circus of
   Nero on the Vatican, which were polluted with the blood of the first
   Christians, have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by
   the abuse of the persecuted religion. On the same spot, a temple, which
   far surpasses the ancient glories of the capital, has been since
   erected by the Christian pontiffs, who, deriving their claim of
   universal dominion from a humble fisherman of Galilee, have succeeded
   to the throne of the Caesars, given laws to the barbarian conquerors of
   Rome, and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the
   Baltic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean." Comp. Renan, L'Antechr. p.
   177: "L'orgie de Néron fut le grand baptême de sanq qui désiqna Rome,
   comme la ville des martyrs, pour jouer un rôle à part dans l'histoire
   du christianisme, et en étre la seconde ville sainte. Ce fut la prise
   de possession de la colline Vatcane par ces triomphateurs d'un genre
   inconnu jusque-là ... Rome, rendue responsable de tout le sang versé,
   devint comme Babylone une sorte de ville sacramentelle et symbolique."

   [534] Tertullian mentions it in connection with the crucifixion of
   Peter and the decapitation of Paul as apparently occurring at the same
   time; De Praescript. Haer., c.36: "Ista quam felix ecclesia (the church
   of Rome) cui totam doctrinam apostoli sanguine suo profuderunt, ubi
   Petrus passioni Dominicae adaequatur, ubi Paulus Joannis exitu
   coronatur, ubi Apostolus Joannes, posteaquam in oleum igneum demersus
   nihil passus est, in insulam relegatur." Comp. Jerome, Adv. Jovin., 1,
   26, and in Matt. 22: 23; and Euseb., H. E., VI. 5. Renan (p. 196)
   conjectures that John was destined to shine in the illumination of the
   Neronian gardens, and was actually steeped in oil for the purpose, but
   saved by an accident or caprice. Thiersch (Die Kirche im Apost.
   Zeitalter, p. 227, third edition, 1879) likewise accepts the tradition
   of Tertullian, but assumes a miraculous deliverance.

   [535] Rev. 11:7; 13:1; 17:1, 3, 5. Comp. Daniel's description of the
   fourth (Roman) beast, "dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly,"
   with "ten horns,"Dan. 7:7 sqq.

   [536] Rev. 17:6.

   [537] Rev. 18:2. Comp. also Rev. 6:9-11.

   [538] This refers either to the crucifixion, or more probably to the
   edict of Claudius, who banished the Jews and Jewish Christians from
   Rome. See above, p. 363.

   [539] Confessed what? Probably the Christian religion, which was
   already regarded as a sort of crime. If they confessed to be guilty of
   incendiarism, they must have been either weak neophytes who could not
   stand the pain of the torture, or hired scoundrels.

   [540] This is to be understood in the active sense of the reputed
   enmity to mankind, with which Tacitus charges the Jews also in almost
   the same terms ("Adversus omnes alios hostile odium," Hist. V. 5). But
   Thiersch and others explain it of the hatred of mankind towards the
   Christians (comp. Matt. 10:22, "Ye shall be hated of all men for my
   name's sake").

   There is scarcely another period in history so full of vice,
   corruption, and disaster as the six years between the Neronian
   persecution and the destruction of Jerusalem. The prophetic description
   of the last days by our Lord began to be fulfilled before the
   generation to which he spoke had passed away, and the day of judgment
   seemed to be close at hand. So the Christians believed and had good
   reason to believe. Even to earnest heathen minds that period looked as
   dark as midnight. We have elsewhere quoted Seneca's picture of the
   frightful moral depravity and decay under the reign of Nero, his pupil
   and murderer. Tacitus begins his history of Rome after the death of
   Nero with these words: "I proceed to a work rich in disasters, full of
   atrocious battles, of discord and rebellion, yea, horrible even in
   peace. Four princes [Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian] killed by the
   sword; three civil wars, several foreign wars; and mostly raging at the
   same time. Favorable events in the East [the subjugation of the Jews],
   unfortunate ones in the West. Illyria disturbed, Gaul uneasy; Britain
   conquered and soon relinquished; the nations of Sarmatia and Suevia
   rising against us; the Parthians excited by the deception of a
   pseudo-Nero. Italy also weighed down by Dew or oft-repeated calamities;
   cities swallowed up or buried in ruins; Rome laid waste by
   conflagrations, the old temples burned up, even the capitol set on fire
   by citizens; sanctuaries desecrated; adultery rampant in high places.
   The sea filled with exiles; the rocky islands contaminated with murder.
   Still more horrible the fury in the city. Nobility, riches, places of
   honor, whether declined or occupied, counted as crimes, and virtue sure
   of destruction. [541]

   The Approaching Doom.

   The most unfortunate country in that period was Palestine, where an
   ancient and venerable nation brought upon itself unspeakable suffering
   and destruction. The tragedy of Jerusalem prefigures in miniature the
   final judgment, and in this light it is represented in the
   eschatological discourses of Christ, who foresaw the end from the
   beginning.

   The forbearance of God with his covenant people, who had crucified
   their own Saviour, reached at last its limit. As many as could be saved
   in the usual way, were rescued. The mass of the people had obstinately
   set themselves against all improvement. James the Just, the man who was
   fitted, if any could be, to reconcile the Jews to the Christian
   religion, had been stoned by his hardened brethren, for whom he daily
   interceded in the temple; and with him the Christian community in
   Jerusalem had lost its importance for that city. The hour of the "great
   tribulation" and fearful judgment drew near. The prophecy of the Lord
   approached its literal fulfilment: Jerusalem was razed to the ground,
   the temple burned, and not one stone was left upon another. [542]

   Not long before the outbreak of the Jewish war, seven years before the
   siege of Jerusalem (a.d. 63), a peasant by the name of Joshua, or
   Jesus, appeared in the city at the Feast of Tabernacles, and in a tone
   of prophetic ecstasy cried day and night on the street among the
   people:, A voice from the morning, a voice from the evening! A voice
   from the four winds! A voice of rain against Jerusalem and the Temple!
   A voice against the bridegrooms and the brides! A voice against the
   whole people! Woe, woe to Jerusalem! "The magistrates, terrified by
   this woe, had the prophet of evil taken up and scourged. He offered no
   resistance, and continued to cry his "Woe." Being brought before the
   procurator, Albinus, he was scourged till his bones could be seen, but
   interposed not a word for himself; uttered no curse on his enemies;
   simply exclaimed at every blow in a mournful tone: "Woe, woe to
   Jerusalem!" To the governor's question, who and whence he was, He
   answered nothing. Finally they let him go, as a madman. But he
   continued for seven years and five months, till the outbreak of the
   war, especially at the three great feasts, to proclaim the approaching
   fall of Jerusalem. During the siege he was singing his dirge, for the
   last time, from the wall. Suddenly he added: "Woe, woe also to
   me!"--and a stone of the Romans hurled at his head put an end to his
   prophetic lamentation. [543]

   The Jewish Rebellion.

   Under the last governors, Felix, Festus, Albinus, and Florus, moral
   corruption and the dissolution of all social ties, but at the same time
   the oppressiveness of the Roman yoke, increased every year. After the
   accession of Felix, assassins, called "Sicarians" (from sica, a
   dagger), armed with daggers and purchasable for any crime, endangering
   safety in city and country, roamed over Palestine. Besides this, the
   party spirit among the Jews themselves, and their hatred of their
   heathen oppressors, rose to the most insolent political and religious
   fanaticism, and was continually inflamed by false prophets and
   Messiahs, one of whom, for example, according to Josephus, drew after
   him thirty thousand men. Thus came to pass what our Lord had predicted:
   "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall lead
   many astray."

   At last, in the month of May, a.d. 66, under the last procurator,
   Gessius Florus (from 65 onward), a wicked and cruel tyrant who, as
   Josephus says, was placed as a hangman over evil-doers, an organized
   rebellion broke out against the Romans, but it the same time a terrible
   civil war also between different parties of the revolters themselves,
   especially between the Zealots, and the Moderates, or the Radicals and
   Conservatives. The ferocious party of the Zealots had all the fire and
   energy which religious and patriotic fanaticism could inspire; they
   have been justly compared with the Montagnards of the French
   Revolution. They gained the ascendancy in the progress of the war, took
   forcible possession of the city and the temple and introduced a reign
   of terror. They kept up the Messianic expectations of the people and
   hailed every step towards destruction as a step towards deliverance.
   Reports of comets, meteors, and all sorts of fearful omens and
   prodigies were interpreted as signs of the common of the Messiah and
   his reign over the heathen. The Romans recognized the Messiah in
   Vespasian and Titus.

   To defy Rome in that age, without a single ally, was to defy the world
   in arms; but religious fanaticism, inspired by the recollection of the
   heroic achievements of the Maccabees, blinded the Jews against the
   inevitable failure of this mad and desperate revolt.

   The Roman Invasion.

   The emperor Nero, informed of the rebellion, sent his most famous
   general, Vespasian, with a large force to Palestine Vespasian opened
   the campaign in the year 67 from the Syrian port-town, Ptolemais
   (Acco), and against a stout resistance overran Galilee with an army of
   sixty thousand men. But events in Rome hindered him from completing the
   victory, and required him to return thither. Nero had killed himself.
   The emperors, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius followed one another in rapid
   succession. The latter was taken out of a dog's kennel in Rome while
   drunk, dragged through the streets, and shamefully put to death.
   Vespasian, in the year 69, was universally proclaimed emperor, and
   restored order and prosperity.

   His son, Titus, who himself ten years after became emperor, and highly
   distinguished himself by his mildness and philanthropy, [544] then
   undertook the prosecution of the Jewish war, and became the instrument
   in the hand of God of destroying the holy city and the temple. He had
   an army of not less than eighty thousand trained soldiers, and planted
   his camp on Mount Scopus and the adjoining Mount Olivet, in full view
   of the city and the temple, which from this height show to the best
   advantage. The valley of the Kedron divided the besiegers from the
   besieged.

   In April, a.d. 70, immediately after the Passover, when Jerusalem was
   filled with strangers, the siege began. The zealots rejected, with
   sneering defiance, the repeated proposals of Titus and the prayers of
   Josephus, who accompanied him as interpreter and mediator; and they
   struck down every one who spoke of surrender. They made sorties down
   the valley of the Kedron and tip the mountain, and inflicted great loss
   oil the Romans. As the difficulties multiplied their courage increased.
   The crucifixion of hundreds of prisoners (as many as five hundred a
   day) only enraged them the more. Even the famine which began to rage
   and sweep away thousands daily, and forced a woman to roast her own
   child, [545] the cries of mothers and babes, the most pitiable scenes
   of misery around them, could not move the crazy fanatics. History
   records no other instance of such obstinate resistance, such desperate
   bravery and contempt of death. The Jews fought, not only for civil
   liberty, life, and their native land, but for that which constituted
   their national pride and glory, and gave their whole history its
   significance--for their religion, which, even in this state of horrible
   degeneracy, infused into them an almost superhuman power of endurance.

   The Destruction of the City and the Temple.

   At last, in July, the castle of Antonia was surprised and taken by
   night. This prepared the way for the destruction of the Temple in which
   the tragedy culminated. The daily sacrifices ceased July 17th, because
   the hands were all needed for defence. The last and the bloodiest
   sacrifice at the altar of burnt offerings was the slaughter of
   thousands of Jews who had crowded around it.

   Titus (according to Josephus) intended at first to save that
   magnificent work of architecture, as a trophy of victory, and perhaps
   from some superstitious fear; and when the flames threatened to reach
   the Holy of Holies he forced his way through flame and smoke, over the
   dead and dying, to arrest the fire. [546] But the destruction was
   determined by a higher decree. His own soldiers, roused to madness by
   the stubborn resistance, and greedy of the golden treasures, could not
   be restrained from the work of destruction. At first the halls around
   the temple were set on fire. Then a firebrand was hurled through the
   golden gate. When the flames arose the Jews raised a hideous yell and
   tried to put out the fire; while others, clinging with a last
   convulsive grasp to their Messianic hopes, rested in the declaration of
   a false prophet, that God in the midst of the conflagration of the
   Temple would give a signal for the deliverance of his people. The
   legions vied with each other in feeding the flames, and made the
   unhappy people feel the full force of their unchained rage. Soon the
   whole prodigious structure was in a blaze and illuminated the skies. It
   was burned on the tenth of August, a.d. 70, the same day of the year on
   which, according to tradition, the first temple was destroyed by
   Nebuchadnezzar. "No one," says Josephus, "can conceive a louder, more
   terrible shriek than arose from all sides during the burning of the
   temple. The shout of victory and the jubilee of the legions sounded
   through the wailings of the people, now surrounded with fire and sword,
   upon the mountain, and throughout the city. The echo from all the
   mountains around, even to Peraea (?), increased the deafening roar. Yet
   the misery itself was more terrible than this disorder. The hill on
   which the temple stood was seething hot, and seemed enveloped to its
   base in one sheet of flame. The blood was larger in quantity than the
   fire, and those that were slain more in number than those that slew
   them. The ground was nowhere visible. All was covered with corpses;
   over these heaps the soldiers pursued the fugitives." [547]

   The Romans planted their eagles on the shapeless ruins, over against
   the eastern gate, offered their sacrifices to them, and proclaimed
   Titus Imperator with the greatest acclamations of joy. Thus was
   fulfilled the prophecy concerning the abomination of desolation
   standing in the holy place." [548]

   Jerusalem was razed to the ground; only three towers of the palace of
   Herod--Hippicus (still standing), Phasael, and Mariamne--together with
   a portion of the western wall, were left as monuments of the strength
   of the conquered city, once the centre of the Jewish theocracy and the
   cradle of the Christian Church.

   Even the heathen Titus is reported to have publicly declared that God,
   by a special providence, aided the Romans and drove the Jews from their
   impregnable strongholds. [549] Josephus, who went through the war
   himself from beginning to end, at first as governor of Galilee and
   general of the Jewish army, then as a prisoner of Vespasian, finally as
   a companion of Titus and mediator between the Romans and Jews,
   recognized in this tragical event a divine judgment and admitted of his
   degenerate countrymen, to whom he was otherwise sincerely attached: "I
   will not hesitate to say what gives me pain: I believe that, had the
   Romans delayed their punishment of these villains, the city would have
   been swallowed up by the earth, or overwhelmed with a flood, or, like
   Sodom, consumed with fire from heaven. For the generation which was in
   it was far more ungodly than the men on whom these punishments had in
   former times fallen. By their madness the whole nation came to be
   ruined." [550]

   Thus, therefore, must one of the best Roman emperors execute the long
   threatened judgment of God, and the most learned Jew of his time
   describe it, and thereby, without willing or knowing it, bear testimony
   to the truth of the prophecy and the divinity of the mission of Jesus
   Christ, the rejection of whom brought all this and the subsequent
   misfortune upon the apostate race.

   The destruction of Jerusalem would be a worthy theme for the genius of
   a Christian Homer. It has been called "the most soul-stirring struggle
   of all ancient history." [551] But there was no Jeremiah to sing the
   funeral dirge of the city of David and Solomon. The Apocalypse was
   already written, and had predicted that the heathen "shall tread the
   holy city under foot forty and two months." [552] One of the master
   artists of modern times, Kaulbach, has made it the subject of one of
   his greatest paintings in the museum at Berlin. It represents the
   burning temple: in the foreground, the high-priest burying his sword in
   his breast; around him, the scenes of heart-rending suffering; above,
   the ancient prophets beholding the fulfilment of their oracles; beneath
   them, Titus with the Roman army as the unconscious executor of the
   Divine wrath; below, to the left, Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew of the
   mediaeval legend, driven by furies into the undying future; and to the
   right the group of Christians departing in peace from the scene of
   destruction, and Jewish children imploring their protection.

   The Fate of the Survivors, and the Triumph in Rome.

   After a siege of five months the entire city was in the hands of the
   victors. The number of the Jews slain during the siege, including all
   those who had crowded into the city from the country, is stated by
   Josephus at the enormous and probably exaggerated figure of one million
   and one hundred thousand. Eleven thousand perished from starvation
   shortly after the close of the siege. Ninety-seven thousand were
   carried captive and sold into slavery, or sent to the mines, or
   sacrificed in the gladiatorial shows at Caesarea, Berytus, Antioch, and
   other cities. The strongest and handsomest men were selected for the
   triumphal procession in Rome, among them the chief defenders and
   leaders of the revolt, Simon Bar-Giora and John of Gischala. [553]

   Vespasian and Titus celebrated the dearly bought victory together (71).
   No expense was spared for the pageant. Crowned with laurel, and clothed
   in purple garments, the two conquerors rode slowly in separate
   chariots, Domitian on a splendid charger, to the temple of Jupiter
   Capitolinus, amid the shouts of the people and the aristocracy. They
   were preceded by the soldiers in festive attire and seven hundred
   Jewish captives. The images of the gods, and the sacred furniture of
   the temple--the table of show-bread, the seven-armed candlestick, the
   trumpets which announced the year of jubilee, the vessel of incense,
   and the rolls of the Law--were borne along in the procession and
   deposited in the newly built Temple of Peace, [554] except the Law and
   the purple veils of the holy place, which Vespasian reserved for his
   palace. Simon Bar-Giora was thrown down from the Tarpeian Rock; John of
   Gischala doomed to perpetual imprisonment. Coins were cast with the
   legend Judaea capta, Judaea devicta. But neither Vespasian nor Titus
   assumed the victorious epithet Judaeus; they despised a people which
   had lost its fatherland.

   Josephus saw the pompous spectacle of the humiliation and wholesale
   crucifixion of his nation, and described it without a tear. [555] The
   thoughtful Christian, looking at the representation of the temple
   furniture borne by captive Jews on the triumphal arch of Titus, still
   standing between the Colosseum and the Forum, is filled with awe at the
   fulfilment of divine prophecy.

   The conquest of Palestine involved the destruction of the Jewish
   commonwealth. Vespasian retained the land as his private property or
   distributed it among his veterans. The people were by the five years'
   war reduced to extreme poverty, and left without a magistrate (in the
   Jewish sense), without a temple, without a country. The renewal of the
   revolt under the false Messiah, Bar-Cocheba, led only to a still more
   complete destruction of Jerusalem and devastation of Palestine by the
   army of Hadrian (132-135). But the Jews still had the law and the
   prophets and the sacred traditions, to which they cling to this day
   with indestructible tenacity and with the hope of a great future.
   Scattered over the earth, at home everywhere and nowhere; refusing to
   mingle their blood with any other race, dwelling in distinct
   communities, marked as a peculiar people in every feature of the
   countenance, in every rite of religion; patient, sober, and
   industrious; successful in every enterprise, prosperous in spite of
   oppression, ridiculed yet feared, robbed yet wealthy, massacred yet
   springing up again, they have outlived the persecution of centuries and
   are likely to continue to live to the end of time: the object of the
   mingled contempt, admiration, and wonder of the world.

   throne 79, in the year when the towns of Herculaneum, Stabiae, and
   Pompeii were destroyed. His reign was marked by a series of terrible
   calamities, among which was a conflagration in Rome which lasted three
   days, and. a plague which destroyed thousands of victims daily. He made
   earnest efforts to repair the injuries, and used to say, when a day
   passed without an act of philanthropy, "Amici, diem perdidi." See
   Suetonius, Titus.

   [545] Josephus, VI. 3, 4, gives a full account of this horrible and
   most unnatural incident.

   [546] Josephus is, however, not quite consistent; he says first that
   Titus, perceiving that his endeavors to spare a foreign temple turned
   to the damage of his soldiers, commanded the gates to be set on fire
   (VI. 4, 1); and then, that on the next day he gave orders to extinguish
   it (§ 3, 6, and 37). Sulpicius Severus (II. 30) makes Titus responsible
   for the destruction, who thought that it would make an end both to the
   Jewish and the Christian religion. This is defended by Stange, De Titi
   imperatoris vita, P. I., 1870, pp. 39-43, but doubted by Schürer, l.c.
   p. 346. Renan (511 sqq.), following Bernays, Ueber die Chronik des
   Sulpicius Sev., 1861, p. 48, believes that Sulpicius drew his account
   from the lost portion of the Histories of Tacitus, and that Titus
   neither ordered nor forbade the burning of the Temple, but left it to
   its fate, with a prudent reservation of his motives. So also Thiersch,

   Roman citizenship, and large possessions in Judaea. Titus and Domitian
   continued the favors. But his countrymen embittered his life and cursed
   his memory. Jost and other Jewish historians speak of him with great
   contempt. King Agrippa, the last of the Idumaean sovereigns, lived and
   died an humble and contented vassal of Rome, in the third year of
   Trajan, a.d. 100. His licentious sister, Berenice, narrowly escaped the
   fate of a second Cleopatra. The conquering Titus was conquered by her
   sensual charms, and desired to raise her to the imperial throne, but
   the public dissatisfaction forced him to dismiss her, "invitus
   invitam." Suet., Tit. 7. Comp. Schürer, l .c. 321, 322.

   § 39. Effects of the Destruction of Jerusalem on the Christian Church.

   The Christians of Jerusalem, remembering the Lord's admonition, forsook
   the doomed city in good time and fled to the town of Pella in the
   Decapolis, beyond the Jordan, in the north of Peraea, where king Herod
   Agrippa II., before whom Paul once stood, opened to them a safe asylum.
   An old tradition says that a divine voice or angel revealed to their
   leaders the duty of flight. [556] There, in the midst of a population
   chiefly Gentile, the church of the circumcision was reconstructed.
   Unfortunately, its history is hidden from us. But it never recovered
   its former importance. When Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Christian city,
   its bishop was raised to the dignity of one of the four patriarchs of
   the East, but it was a patriarchate of honor, not of power, and sank to
   a mere shadow after the Mohammedan invasion.

   The awful catastrophe of the destruction of the Jewish theocracy must
   have produced the profoundest sensation among the Christians, of which
   we now, in the absence of all particular information respecting it, can
   hardly form a true conception. [557] It was the greatest calamity of
   Judaism and a great benefit to Christianity; a refutation of the one, a
   vindication and emancipation of the other. It not only gave a mighty
   impulse to faith, but at the same time formed a proper epoch in the
   history of the relation between the two religious bodies. It separated
   them forever. It is true the apostle Paul had before now inwardly
   completed this separation by the Christian universality of his whole
   system of doctrine; but outwardly he had in various ways accommodated
   himself to Judaism, and had more than once religiously visited tile
   temple. He wished not to appear as a revolutionist, nor to anticipate
   the natural course of history, tile ways of Providence. [558] But now
   the rupture was also outwardly consummated by the thunderbolt of divine
   omnipotence. God himself destroyed the house, in which he had thus far
   dwelt, in which Jesus had taught, in which the apostles had prayed; he
   rejected his peculiar people for their obstinate rejection of the
   Messiah; he demolished the whole fabric of the Mosaic theocracy, whose
   system of worship was, in its very nature, associated exclusively with
   the tabernacle at first and afterwards with the temple; but in so doing
   he cut the cords which had hitherto bound, and according to the law of
   organic development necessarily bound the infant church to the outward
   economy of the old covenant, and to Jerusalem as its centre. Henceforth
   the heathen could no longer look upon Christianity as a mere sect of
   Judaism, but must regard and treat it as a new, peculiar religion. The
   destruction of Jerusalem, therefore, marks that momentous crisis at
   which the Christian church as a whole burst forth forever from the
   chrysalis of Judaism, awoke to a sense of its maturity, and in
   government and worship at once took its independent stand before the
   world. [559]

   This breaking away from hardened Judaism and its religious forms,
   however, involved no departure from the spirit of the Old Testament
   revelation. The church, on the contrary, entered into the inheritance
   of Israel. The Christians appeared as genuine Jews, as spiritual
   children of Abraham, who, following the inward current of the Mosaic
   religion, had found Him, who was the fulfilment of the law and the
   prophets; the perfect fruit of the old covenant and the living germ of
   the new; the beginning and the principle of a new moral creation.

   It now only remained to complete the consolidation of the church in
   this altered state of things; to combine the premises in their results;
   to take up the conservative tendency of Peter and the progressive
   tendency of Paul, as embodied respectively in the Jewish-Christian and
   the Gentile-Christian churches, and to fuse them into a third and
   higher tendency in a permanent organism; to set forth alike the unity
   of the two Testaments in diversity, and their diversity in unity; and
   in this way to wind up the history of the apostolic church.

   This was the work of John, the apostle of completion.

   § 40. The Johannean Literature.

   I. Sources.

   1. The Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation of John. The notices of John in
   the Synoptical Gospels, in the Acts, and in Gal. 2:9. (See the passages
   in Young's Analytical Concordance.)

   in Eus. Hist. Eccl., III. 31; V. 24 (John, one of the megala stoicheia,
   and a hiereus to petalon pephorekos). Tertullian: De praescr. haer., c.
   36 (the legend of John's martyrdom in Rome by being steeped in oil, and
   his miraculous preservation). Eusebius: Hist. Eccl, III. chs. 18, 23,
   31; IV. 14; V. 24 (the paschal controversy). Jerome: Ad Gal. 6:10 (the

   II. Apocryphal Traditions.

   Acta Johannis, ed. Const. Tischendorf, in his Acta Apost. Apocr.,
   Lips., 1851, pp. 266-276. Comp. Prolegg. LXXIII. sqq., where the
   patristic testimonies on the apocryphal Acts of John are collected.

   Acta Joannis, unter Benutzung von C. v. Tischendorf's Nachlass
   bearbeitet von Theod. Zahn. Erlangen, 1880 (264 pages and clxxii. pages

   The "Acta "contain the praxeis tou ... Ioannou tou theologou Prochorus,
   who professes to be one of the Seventy Disciples, one of the Seven
   Deacons of Jerusalem (Acts 6:5), and a pupil of St. John; and fragments
   of the periodoi Ioannou, "the Wanderings of John," by Leucius Charinus,
   a friend and pupil of John. The former work is a religious romance,
   written about 400 years after the death of John; the latter is assigned
   by Zahn to an author in Asia Minor before 160, and probably before 140;
   it uses the fourth as well as the Synoptical Gospels, and so far has
   some apologetic value. See p. cxlviii.

   Max Bonnet, the French philologist, promises a new critical edition of
   the Acts of John. See E. Leroux's "Revue critique," 1880, p. 449.

   Esdrae, Pauli, Johannis, item Mariae Dormitio. Lips., 1866, pp. 70-94.

   This pseudo-Johannean Apocalypse purports to have been written shortly
   after the ascension of Christ, by St. John, on Mount Tabor. It exists
   in MS. from the ninth century, and was first edited by A. Birch, 1804.

   1875 (from Evanson to Luthardt), is given with unusual fulness and
   accuracy by Dr. Caspar René Gregory (an American scholar), in an
   appendix to his translation of Luthardt's St. John, the Author of the
   Fourth Gospel. Edinb. 1875, pp. 283-360. Comp. also the very careful
   lists of Dr. Ezra Abbot (down to 1869) in the article John, Gospel of,

   VI. Special Treatises on the Genuineness and Credibility of the

   Fourth Gospel.

   We have no room to give all the titles of books, or the pages in the
   introductions to Commentaries, and refer to the lists of Abbot and
   Gregory.

   a. Writers against the Genuineness:

   E. Evanson (The Dissonance of the Four generally received Evangelists,
   Gloucester, 1792). K. G. Bretschneider (Probabilia de Ev. et Ep. Joh.
   Ap. Indole et Origine, Leips. 1820, refuted by Schott, Eichhorn, Lücke,
   and others; retracted by the author himself in 1828). D. F. Strauss (in
   his Leben Jesu, 1835; withdrawn in the 3d ed. 1838, but renewed in the
   4th, 1840 in his Leben Jesu für das deutsche Volk, 1864); Lützelberger
   (1840); Bruno Baum (1840).--F. Chr. BAUR (first in a very acute and
   ingenious analysis of the Gospel, in the "Theol. Jahrbücher," of
   Tübingen, 1844, and again in 1847, 1848, 1853, 1855, 1859). He
   represents the fourth Gospel as the ripe result of a literary
   development, or evolution, which proceeded, according to the Hegelian
   method, from thesis to antithesis and synthesis, or from Judaizing
   Petrinism to anti-Jewish Paulinism and (pseudo-) Johannean
   reconciliation. He was followed by the whole Tübingen School; Zeller
   (1845, 1847, 1853); Schwegler (1846); Hilgenfeld (1849, 1854, 1855,
   1875); Volkmar (1870, 1876); Schenkel (1864 and 1873); Holtzmann (in
   Schenkel's "Bibellexikon." 1871, and Einleitung, 1886). Keim (Gesch.
   Jesu v. Nazara, since 1867, vol. I., 146 sqq.; 167 sqq., and in the 3d
   ed. of his abridgement, 1875, p. 40); Hausrath (1874); Mangold (in the
   4th ed. of Bleek's Introd., 1886); Thoma (1882). In Holland, Scholten
   (Leyden, 1865, and again 1871). In England, J. J. Tayler (London,
   1867); Samuel Davidson (in the new ed. of his Introduction to the N.
   T., 1868, II. 323 sqq. and 357 sqq.); the anonymous author of
   Supernatural Religion (vol. II. 251 sqq., of the 6th ed., London,
   1875); and E. A. A. (Edwin A. Abbott, D. D., of London, in art.
   Gospels, "Encycl. Brit.," vol. X., 1879, pp. 818-843).

   The dates assigned to the composition of the Fourth Gospel by these
   opponents vary from 110 to 170, but the best scholars among them are
   more and more forced to retreat from 170 (Baur's date) to 130 (Keim),
   or to the very beginning of the second century (110). This is fatal to
   their theory; for at that time many of the personal friends and pupils
   of John must have been still living to prevent a literary fiction from
   being generally accepted in the church as a genuine work of the
   apostle.

   Reuss (in his Théologie johannique, 1879, in the sixth part of his
   great work, "La Bible" and in the Sixth edition of hisGeschichte der
   heil. Schriften N. T., 1887, pp. 249 sqq.) leaves the question
   undecided, though inclining against the Johannean authorship. Sabatier,
   who had formerly defended the authenticity (in his Essai sur les
   sources de la vie de Jésus, 1866), follows the steps of Reuss, and
   comes to a negative conclusion (in his art. Jean in Lichtenberger's
   "Encycl. des Sciences Relig.," Tom. VII., Paris, 1880, pp. 173 sqq.).

   Weisse (1836), Schweizer (1841), Weizsäcker (1857, 1859, 1862, 1886),
   Hase (in his Geschichte Jesu, 1875, while in his earlier writings he
   had defended the genuineness), and Renan (1863, 1867, and 1879) admit
   genuine portions in the Fourth Gospel, but differ among themselves as
   to the extent. Some defend the genuineness of the discourses, but
   reject the miracles. Renan, on the contrary, favors the historical
   portions, but rejects the discourses of Christ, in a special discussion
   in the 13th ed. of his Vie de Jésus, pp. 477 sqq. He changed his view
   again in his L'église chrétienne, 1879, pp. 47 sqq. "Ce qui paraît le
   plus probable," he says, "c'est qu'un disciple de l'apôtre, dépositaire
   de plusieurs de ses souvenirs, se crut autorisé à parler en son nom et
   à écrire, vingt-cinq ou trente ans aprés sa mort, ce que l'on
   regrettait qu'il n'eût pas lui-même fixé de son vivant." He is disposed
   to ascribe the composition to the "Presbyter John" (whose very
   existence is doubtful) and to Aristion, two Ephesian disciples of John
   the Apostle. In characterizing the discourses in the Gospel of John he
   shows his utter incapacity of appreciating its spirit. Matthew Arnold
   (God and the Bible, p. 248) conjectures that the Ephesian presbyters
   composed the Gospel with the aid of materials furnished by John.

   It should be remarked that Baur and his followers, and Renan, while
   they reject the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel, strongly defend the
   Johannean origin of the Apocalypse, as one of the certain documents of
   the apostolic age. But Keim, by denying the whole tradition of John's
   sojourn at Ephesus, destroys the foundation of Baur's theory.

   § 41. Life and Character of John

   "Volat avis sine meta,

   Quo nec votes nec propheta

   Evolavit altius:

   Tam implenda quam impleta,

   Numquam vidit tot secreta

   Purus homo purius.

   (Adam of St. Victor.)

   The Mission of John.

   Peter, the Jewish apostle of authority, and Paul, the Gentile apostle
   of freedom, had done their work on earth before the destruction of
   Jerusalem--had done it for their age and for all ages to come; had done
   it, and by the influence of their writings are doing it still, in a
   manner that can never be superseded. Both were master-builders, the one
   in laying the foundation, the other in rearing the superstructure, of
   the church of Christ, against which the gates of Hades can never
   prevail.

   But there remained a most important additional work to be done, a work
   of union and consolidation. This was reserved for the apostle of love,
   the bosom-friend of Jesus, who had become his most perfect reflection
   so far as any human being can reflect the ideal of divine-human purity
   and holiness. John was not a missionary or a man of action, like Peter
   and Paul. He did little, so far as we know, for the outward spread of
   Christianity, but all the more for the inner life and growth of
   Christianity where it was already established. He has nothing to say
   about the government, the forms, and rites of the visible church (even
   the name does not occur in his Gospel and first Epistle), but all the
   more about the spiritual substance of the church--the vital union of
   believers with Christ and the brotherly communion of believers among
   themselves. He is at once the apostle, the evangelist, and the seer, of
   the new covenant. He lived to the close of the first century, that he
   might erect on the foundation and superstructure of the apostolic age
   the majestic dome gilded by the light of the new heaven.

   He had to wait in silent meditation till the church was ripe for his
   sublime teaching. This is intimated by the mysterious word of our Lord
   to Peter with reference to John: "If I will that he tarry till I come,
   what is that to thee?" [560] No doubt the Lord did come in the terrible
   judgment of Jerusalem. John outlived it personally, and his type of
   doctrine and character will outlive the earlier stages of church
   history (anticipated and typified by Peter and Paul) till the final
   coming of the Lord. In that wider sense he tarries even till now, and
   his writings, with their unexplored depths and heights still wait for
   the proper interpreter. The best comes last. In the vision of Elijah on
   Mount Horeb, the strong wind that rent the mountains and brake in
   pieces the rocks, and the earthquake, and the fire preceded the still
   small voice of Jehovah. [561] The owl of Minerva, the goddess of
   wisdom, begins its flight at twilight. The storm of battle prepares the
   way for the feast of peace. The great warrior of the apostolic age
   already sounded the keynote of love which was to harmonize the two
   sections of Christendom; and John only responded to Paul when he
   revealed the inmost heart of the supreme being by the profoundest of
   all definitions: "God is love." [562]

   John in the Gospels.

   John was a son (probably the younger son) of Zebedee and Salome, and a
   brother of the elder James, who became the protomartyr of the apostles.
   [563] He may have been about ten years younger than Jesus, and as,
   according to the unanimous testimony of antiquity, he lived till the
   reign of Trajan, i.e., till after 98, he must have attained an age of
   over ninety years. He was a fisherman by trade, probably of Bethsaida
   in Galilee (like Peter, Andrew, and Philip). His parents seem to have
   been in comfortable circumstances. His father kept hired servants; his
   mother belonged to the noble band of women who followed Jesus and
   supported him with their means, who purchased spices to embalm him, who
   were the last at the cross and the first at the open tomb. John himself
   was acquainted with the high priest, and owned a house in Jerusalem or
   Galilee, into which he received the mother of our Lord. [564]

   He was a cousin of Jesus, according to the flesh, from his mother, a
   sister of Mary. [565] This relationship, together with the enthusiasm
   of youth and the fervor of his emotional nature, formed the basis of
   his intimacy with the Lord.

   He had no rabbinical training, like Paul, and in the eyes of the Jewish
   scholars he was, like Peter and the other Galilaean disciples, an
   "unlearned and ignorant man." [566] But he passed through the
   preparatory school of John the Baptist who summed up his prophetic
   mission in the testimony to Jesus as the "Lamb of God that taketh away
   the sin of the world," a testimony which he afterwards expanded in his
   own writings. It was this testimony which led him to Jesus on the banks
   of the Jordan in that memorable interview of which, half a century
   afterwards, he remembered the very hour. [567] He was not only one of
   the Twelve, but the chosen of the chosen Three. Peter stood out more
   prominently before the public as the friend of the Messiah; John was
   known in the private circle as the friend of Jesus. [568] Peter always
   looked at the official character of Christ, and asked what he and the
   other apostles should do; John gazed steadily at the person of Jesus,
   and was intent to learn what the Master said. They differed as the busy
   Martha, anxious to serve, and the pensive Mary, contented to learn.
   John alone, with Peter and his brother James, witnessed the scene of
   the transfiguration and of Gethsemane--the highest exaltation and the
   deepest humiliation in the earthly life of our Lord. He leaned on his
   breast at the last Supper and treasured those wonderful farewell
   discourses in his heart for future use. He followed him to the court of
   Caiaphas. He alone of all the disciples was present at the crucifixion,
   and was intrusted by the departing Saviour with the care of his mother.
   This was a scene of unique delicacy and tenderness: the Mater dolorosa
   and the beloved disciple gazing at the cross, the dying Son and Lord
   uniting them in maternal and filial love. It furnishes the type of
   those heaven-born spiritual relationships, which are deeper and
   stronger than those of blood and interest. As John was the last at the
   cross, so he was also, next to Mary Magdalene, the first of the
   disciples who, outrunning even Peter, looked into the open tomb on the
   resurrection morning; and he first recognized the risen Lord when he
   appeared to the disciples on the shore of the lake of Galilee. [569]

   He seems to have been the youngest of the apostles, as he long outlived
   them all; he certainly was the most gifted and the most favored. He had
   a religious genius of the highest order--not indeed for planting, but
   for watering; not for outward action and aggressive work, but for
   inward contemplation and insight into the mystery of Christ's person
   and of eternal life in him. Purity and simplicity of character, depth
   and ardor of affection, and a rare faculty of spiritual perception and
   intuition, were his leading traits, which became ennobled and
   consecrated by divine grace.

   There are no violent changes reported in John's history; he grew
   silently and imperceptibly into the communion of his Lord and
   conformity to his example; he was in this respect the antipode of Paul.
   He heard more and saw more, but spoke less, than the other disciples.
   He absorbed his deepest sayings, which escaped the attention of others;
   and although he himself did not understand them at first, he pondered
   them in his heart till the Holy Spirit illuminated them. His intimacy
   with Mary must also have aided him in gaining an interior view of the
   mind and heart of his Lord. He appears throughout as the beloved
   disciple, in closest intimacy and in fullest sympathy with the Lord.
   [570]

   The Son of Thunder and the Beloved Disciple.

   There is an apparent contradiction between the Synoptic and the
   Johannean picture of John, as there is between the Apocalypse and the
   fourth Gospel; but on closer inspection it is only the twofold aspect
   of one and the same character. We have a parallel in the Peter of the
   Gospels and the Peter of his Epistles: the first youthful, impulsive,
   hasty, changeable, the other matured, subdued, mellowed, refined by
   divine grace.

   In the Gospel of Mark, John appears as a Son of Thunder (Boanerges).
   [571] This surname, given to him and to his elder brother by our
   Saviour, was undoubtedly an epithet of honor and foreshadowed his
   future mission, like the name Peter given to Simon. Thunder to the
   Hebrews was the voice of God. [572] It conveys the idea of ardent
   temper, great strength and vehemence of character whether for good or
   for evil, according to the motive and aim. The same thunder which
   terrifies does also purify the air and fructify the earth with its
   accompanying showers of rain. Fiery temper under the control of reason
   and in the service of truth is as great a power of construction as the
   same temper, uncontrolled and misdirected, is a power of destruction.
   John's burning zeal and devotion needed only discipline and discretion
   to become a benediction and inspiration to the church in all ages.

   In their early history the sons of Zebedee misunderstood the difference
   between the law and the gospel, when, in an outburst of holy
   indignation against a Samaritan village which refused to receive Jesus,
   they were ready, like Elijah of old, to call consuming fire from
   heaven. [573] But when, some years afterwards, John went to Samaria to
   confirm the new converts, he called down upon them the fire of divine
   life and light, the gift of the Holy Spirit. [574] The same mistaken
   zeal for his Master was at the bottom of his intolerance towards those
   who performed a good work in the name of Christ, but outside of the
   apostolic circle. [575] The desire of the two brothers, in which their
   mother shared, for the highest positions in the Messianic kingdom,
   likewise reveals both their strength and their weakness, a noble
   ambition to be near Christ, though it be near the fire and the sword,
   yet an ambition that was not free from selfishness and pride, which
   deserved the rebuke of our Lord, who held up before them the prospect
   of the baptism of blood. [576]

   All this is quite consistent with the writings of John. He appears
   there by no means as a soft and sentimental, but as a positive and
   decided character. He had no doubt a sweet and lovely disposition, but
   at the same time a delicate sensibility, ardent feelings, and strong
   convictions. These traits are by no means incompatible. He knew no
   compromise, no division of loyalty. A holy fire burned within him,
   though he was moved in the deep rather than on the surface. In the
   Apocalypse, the thunder rolls loud and mighty against the enemies of
   Christ and his kingdom, while on the other hand there are in the same
   book episodes of rest and anthems, of peace and joy, and a description
   of the heavenly Jerusalem, which could have proceeded only from the
   beloved disciple. In the Gospel and the Epistles of John, we feel the
   same power, only subdued and restrained. He reports the severest as
   well as the sweetest discourses of the Saviour, according as he speaks
   to the enemies of the truth, or in the circle of the disciples. No
   other evangelist gives us such a profound inside-view of the antagonism
   between Christ and the Jewish hierarchy, and of the growing intensity
   of that hatred which culminated in the bloody counsel; no apostle draws
   a sharper line of demarcation between light and darkness, truth and
   falsehood, Christ and Antichrist, than John. His Gospel and Epistles
   move in these irreconcilable antagonisms. He knows no compromise
   between God and Baal. With what holy horror does he speak of the
   traitor, and the rising rage of the Pharisees against their Messiah!
   How severely does he, in the words of the Lord, attack the unbelieving
   Jews with their murderous designs, as children of the devil! And, in
   his Epistles, he terms every one who dishonors his Christian profession
   a liar; every one who hates his brother a murderer; every one who
   wilfully sins a child of the devil; and he earnestly warns against
   teachers who deny the mystery of the incarnation, as Antichrists, and
   he forbids even to salute them. [577] The measure of his love of Christ
   was the measure of his hatred of antichrist. For hatred is inverted
   love. Love and hatred are one and the same passion, only revealed in
   opposite directions. The same sun gives light and heat to the living,
   and hastens the decay of the dead.

   Christian art has so far well understood the double aspect of John by
   representing him with a face of womanly purity and tenderness, but not
   weakness, and giving him for his symbol a bold eagle soaring with
   outspread wings above the clouds. [578]

   The Apocalypse and the Fourth Gospel.

   A proper appreciation of John's character as thus set forth removes the
   chief difficulty of ascribing the Apocalypse and the fourth Gospel to
   one and the same writer. [579] The temper is the same in both: a noble,
   enthusiastic nature, capable of intense emotions of love and hatred,
   but with the difference between vigorous manhood and ripe old age,
   between the roar of battle and the repose of peace. The theology is the
   same, including the most characteristic features of Christology and
   soteriology. [580] By no other apostle is Christ called the Logos. The
   Gospel is, "the Apocalypse spiritualized," or idealized. Even the
   difference of style, which is startling at first sight, disappears on
   closer inspection. The Greek of the Apocalypse is the most Hebraizing
   of all the books of the New Testament, as may be expected from its
   close affinity with Hebrew prophecy to which the classical Greek
   furnished no parallel, while the Greek of the fourth Gospel is pure,
   and free from irregularities; yet after all John the Evangelist also
   shows the greatest familiarity with, and the deepest insight into, the
   Hebrew religion, and preserves its purest and noblest elements; and his
   style has all the childlike simplicity and sententious brevity of the
   Old Testament; it is only a Greek body inspired by a Hebrew soul. [581]

   In accounting for the difference between the Apocalypse and the other
   writings of John, we must also take into consideration the necessary
   difference between prophetic composition under direct inspiration, and
   historical and didactic composition, and the intervening time of about
   twenty years; the Apocalypse being written before the destruction of
   Jerusalem, the fourth Gospel towards the close of the first century, in
   extreme old age, when his youth was renewed like the eagle's, as in the
   case of some of the greatest poets, Homer, Sophocles, Milton, and
   Goethe.

   Notes.

   I. The Son of Thunder and the Apostle of Love.

   I quote some excellent remarks on the character of John from my friend,
   Dr. Godet (Com. I. 35, English translation by Crombie and Cusin):

   "How are we to explain two features of character apparently so
   opposite? There exist profound receptive natures which are accustomed
   to shut up their impressions within themselves, and this all the more
   that these impressions are keen and thrilling. But if it happens that
   these persons once cease to be masters of themselves, their
   long-restrained emotions then burst forth in sudden explosions, which
   fill the persons around them with amazement. Does not the character of
   John belong to this order? And when Jesus gave to him and his brother
   the surname of Boanerges, sons of thunder (Mark 3:17), could he have
   described them better? I cannot think that, by that surname, Jesus
   intended, as all the old writers have believed, to signalize the
   eloquence which distinguished them. Neither can I allow that he desired
   by that surname to perpetuate the recollection of their anger in one of
   the cases indicated. We are led by what precedes to a more natural
   explanation, and one more worthy of Jesus himself. As electricity is
   stored up by degrees in the cloud until it bursts forth suddenly in the
   lightning and thunderbolt, so in those two loving and passionate
   natures impressions silently accumulated till the moment when the heart
   overflowed, and they took an unexpected and violent flight. We love to
   represent St. John to ourselves as of a gentle rather than of an
   energetic nature, tender even to weakness. Do not his writings insist
   before and above all else upon love? Were not the last sermons of the
   old man 'Love one another?' That is true; but we forget other features
   of a different kind, during the first and last periods of his life,
   which reveal something decisive, sharp, absolute, even violent in his
   disposition. If we take all the facts stated into consideration, we
   shall recognize in him one of those sensitive, ardent souls,
   worshippers of an ideal, who attach themselves at first sight, and
   without reservation, to that being who seems to them to realize that of
   which they have dreamt, and whose devotion easily becomes exclusive and
   intolerant. They feel themselves repelled by everything which is not in
   sympathy with their enthusiasm. They no longer understand a division of
   heart which they themselves know not how to practice. All for all! such
   is their motto. Where that all is not, there is in their eyes nothing.
   Such affections do not subsist without including an alloy of impure
   egoism. A divine work is needed, in order that the true devotion, which
   constitutes the basis of such, may shine forth at the last in all its
   sublimity. Such was, if we are not deceived, the inmost history of
   John." Comp. the third French ed. of Godet's Com., I. p. 50.

   Dr. Westcott (in his Com., p. xxxiii.): "John knew that to be with
   Christ was life, to reject Christ was death; and he did not shrink from
   expressing the thought in the spirit of the old dispensation. He
   learned from the Lord, as time went on, a more faithful patience, but
   he did not unlearn the burning devotion which consumed him. To the
   last, words of awful warning, like the thunderings about the throne,
   reveal the presence of that secret fire. Every page of the Apocalypse
   is inspired with the cry of the souls beneath the altar, 'How long'
   (Rev. 6:10); and nowhere is error as to the person of Christ denounced
   more sternly than in his Epistles (2 John 10; 1 John 4:1ff.)." Similar
   passages in Stanley.

   II. The Mission of John.

   Dean Stanley (Sermons and Essays on the Apost. Age, p. 249 sq., 3d
   ed.): "Above all John spoke of the union of the soul with God, but it
   was by no mere process of oriental contemplation, or mystic absorption;
   it was by that word which now for the first time took its proper place
   in the order of the world--by Love. It has been reserved for St. Paul
   to proclaim that the deepest principle in the heart of man was Faith;
   it was reserved for St. John to proclaim that the essential attribute
   of God is Love. It had been taught by the Old Testament that 'the
   beginning of wisdom was the fear of God;' it remained to be taught by
   the last apostle of the New Testament that 'the end of wisdom was the
   love of God.' It had been taught of old time by Jew and by heathen, by
   Greek philosophy and Eastern religion, that the Divinity was well
   pleased with the sacrifices, the speculations, the tortures of man; it
   was to St. John that it was left to teach in all its fulness that the
   one sign of God's children is 'the love of the brethren.' And as it is
   Love that pervades our whole conception of his teaching, so also it
   pervades our whole conception of his character. We see him--it surely
   is no unwarranted fancy--we see him declining with the declining
   century; every sense and faculty waxing feebler, but that one divinest
   faculty of all burning more and more brightly; we see it breathing
   through every look and gesture; the one animating principle of the
   atmosphere in which he lives and moves; earth and heaven, the past, the
   present, and the future alike echoing to him that dying strain of his
   latest words, 'We love Him because He loved us.' And when at last he
   disappears from our view in the last pages of the sacred volume,
   ecclesiastical tradition still lingers in the close: and in that
   touching story, not the less impressive because so familiar to us, we
   see the aged apostle borne in the arms of his disciples into the
   Ephesian assembly, and there repeating over and over again the same
   saying, 'Little children, love one another;' till, when asked why he
   said this and nothing else, he replied in those well known words, fit
   indeed to be the farewell speech of the Beloved Disciple, 'Because this
   is our Lord's command and if you fulfil this, nothing else is needed.'
   "
     __________________________________________________________________

   [560] John 21:22, 23. Milligan and Moulton in loc. The point of
   contrast between the words spoken respectively to Peter and John, is
   not that between a violent death by martyrdom and a peaceful departure;
   but that between impetuous and struggling apostleship, ending in a
   violent death, and quiet, thoughtful, meditative waiting for the Second
   Coming of Jesus, ending in a peaceful transition to the heavenly
   repose. Neither Peter nor himself is to the Evangelist a mere
   individual. Each is a type of one aspect of apostolic working--of
   Christian witnessing for Jesus to the very end of time."

   [561] 1 Kings 19:11, 12.

   [562] 1 Cor., ch. 13; 1 John 4:8, 16.

   [563] The name John, from the Hebrew nnchvhy or nnhvy, i.e., Jehovah is
   gracious (comp. the German Gotthold), implied to his mind a prophecy of
   his relation to Jesus, the incarnate Jehovah (comp. John 12:41 with
   Isa. 6:1), and is equivalent to "the disciple whom Jesus loved," John
   13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20. The Greek fathers call John ho
   epistethios, the leaner on the bosom, or, as we would say, the
   bosom-friend (of Jesus).

   [564] Mark 1:20; 15: 40 sq.; Luke 8:3; John 19:27. Godet (I. 37) thinks
   that his home was on the lake of Gennesareth, and accounts thus for his
   absence in Jerusalem at Paul's first visit (Gal. 1:18, 19).

   [565] According to the correct interpretation of John 19:25, that four
   woman (not three) are meant there, as Wieseler, Ewald, Meyer., Lange,
   and other commentators now hold. The writer of the Fourth Gospel, from
   peculiar delicacy, never mentions his own name, nor the name of his
   mother, nor the name of the mother of our Lord; yet his mother was
   certainly at the cross, according to the Synoptists, and he would not
   omit her.

   [566] Acts 4:13, anthropoi agrammatoi kai idiotai.

   [567] John 1:35-40. The commentators are agreed that the unnamed of the
   two disciples is John. See my notes in Lange on the passage.

   and philiesous.

   [570] For an ingenious comparison between John and Salome, John and
   James, John and Andrew, John and Peter, John and Paul, see Lange's Com
   on John, pp. 4-10 (Am. ed.).

   [571] Mark 3:17. Boanerges (as Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Tregelles
   read, in. of Gr. Boanerges), ie.,huioi brontes. The word is usually
   derived from shgr ynb (as pronounced in the broad Galilean dialect).
   shgr means a noisy crowd of men, but may have had the significance of
   thunder in Syriac. Robinson derives it from zgr which means tumult,
   alarm, and is used of the roaring noise of thunder, Job 37:2. The usual
   Hebrew word for thunder is r?m(Ps. 77:19; 81:8; Job 26:14). This name
   completely dispels the popular notion of John. "Nichts,"says Hilgenfeld
   (Einleit., p. 393), "stimmt zu den synoptischen Evangelien weniger als
   jenes mädchenhafte Johannesbild, welches unter uns gangbar geworden
   ist."Comp. Godet's remarks at the close of this section.

   [572] "The Lord thundered with a great thunder;" "The Lord shall send
   thunder and rain." See Ex. 9:23; 1 Sam. 7:10; 12:17, 18; Job 26:14; Ps.
   77:18; 81:7; 104:7; Isa. 29:6, etc.

   [573] Luke 9:4-56. Some commentators think that this incident suggested
   the giving of the name Boanerges; but that would make it an epithet of
   censure, which the Lord would certainly not fasten upon his beloved
   disciple.

   John 10 and 11.

   [578] Jerome (Com. ad Matth., Proaem., Opera, ed. Migne, Tom. vii. 19):
   Quarta [facies]Joannem evangelistam [significat],qui assumptis pennis
   aquilae, et ad altiora festinans, de Verbo Dei disputat. An old epigram
   says of John: "More volans aquila, verbo petit astra Joannes."

   [579] The author of Supernat. Relig., II.400, says: "Instead of the
   fierce and intolerant spirit of the Son of Thunder, we find [in the
   Fourth Gospel] a spirit breathing forth nothing but gentleness and
   love." How superficial this judgment is appears from our text.

   [580] This is well shown in Gebhardt's Doctrine of the Apocalypse, and
   is substantially even acknowledged by those who deny the Johannean
   origin of either the Apocalypse (the Schleiermacher School), or of the
   Gospel (the Tübingen School)."Es ist nicht blos," says Baur (in his
   Church History, vol. I. p. 147), "eine äussere Anlehnnung an einen
   vielgefeierten Namen, es fehlt auch nicht an innern Berührungspunkten
   zwischen dem Evangelium und der Apokalypse, und man kann nur die tiefe
   Genialität und feine Kunst bewundern, mit welcher der Evangelist die
   Elemente, welche vom Standpunkt der Apokalypse auf den freiern und
   höhern des Evangeliums hinüberleiteten, in sich aufgenommen hat, um die
   Apokalypse zum Evangelium zu vergeistigen. Nur vom Standpunkt dei
   Evangeliums aus lässt sich das Verhältniss, in das sich der Verfasser
   desselben zu der Apokalypse setzte, richtig begreifen."Schwegler and
   Köstlin make similar concessions. See my Hist. of the Apost. Ch., p.
   425.

   [581] In this way the opposite views of two eminent Hebrew scholars and
   judges of style may be reconciled. While Renan, looking at the surface,
   says of the fourth Gospel: "John's style has nothing Hebrew, nothing
   Jewish, nothing Talmudic," Ewald, on the contrary, penetrating to the
   core, remarks: "In its true spirit and afflatus, no language can be
   more genuinely Hebrew than that of John." Godet agrees with Ewald when
   he says: "The dress only is Greek, the body is Hebrew."

   § 42. Apostolic Labors of John.

   John in the Acts.

   In the first stadium of Apostolic Christianity John figures as one of
   the three pillars of the church of the circumcision, together with
   Peter and James the brother of the Lord; while Paul and Barnabas
   represented the Gentile church. [582] This seems to imply that at that
   time he had not yet risen to the full apprehension of the universalism
   and freedom of the gospel. But he was the most liberal of the three,
   standing between James and Peter on the one hand, and Paul on the
   other, and looking already towards a reconciliation of Jewish and
   Gentile Christianity. The Judaizers never appealed to him as they did
   to James, or to Peter. [583] There is no trace of a Johannean party, as
   there is of a Cephas party and a party of James. He stood above strife
   and division.

   In the earlier chapters of the Acts he appears, next to Peter, as the
   chief apostle of the new religion; he heals with him the cripple at the
   gate of the temple; he was brought with him before the Sanhedrin to
   bear witness to Christ; he is sent with him by the apostles from
   Jerusalem to Samaria to confirm the Christian converts by imparting to
   them the Holy Spirit; he returned with him to Jerusalem. [584] But
   Peter is always named first and takes the lead in word and act; John
   follows in mysterious silence and makes the impression of a reserved
   force which will manifest itself at some future time. He must have been
   present at the conference of the apostles in Jerusalem, a.d. 50, but he
   made no speech and took no active part in the great discussion about
   circumcision and the terms of church membership. [585] All this is in
   entire keeping with the character of modest and silent prominence given
   to him in the Gospels.

   After the year 50 he seems to have left Jerusalem. The Acts no more
   mention him nor Peter. When Paul made his fifth and last visit to the
   holy City (a.d. 58) he met James, but none of the apostles. [586]

   John at Ephesus.

   The later and most important labors of John are contained in his
   writings, which we shall fully consider in another chapter. They
   exhibit to us a history that is almost exclusively inward and
   spiritual, but of immeasurable reach and import. They make no allusion
   to the time and place of residence and composition. But the Apocalypse
   implies that he stood at the head of the churches of Asia Minor. [587]
   This is confirmed by the unanimous testimony of antiquity which is
   above all reasonable doubt, and assigns Ephesus to him as the residence
   of his latter years. [588] He died there in extreme old age during the
   reign of Trajan, which began in 98. His grave also was shown there in
   the second century.

   We do not know when he removed to Asia Minor, but he cannot have done
   so before the year 63. For in his valedictory address to the Ephesian
   elders, and in his Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians and the
   second to Timothy, Paul makes no allusion to John, and speaks with the
   authority of a superintendent of the churches of Asia Minor. It was
   probably the martyrdom of Peter and Paul that induced John to take
   charge of the orphan churches, exposed to serious dangers and trials.
   [589]

   Ephesus, the capital of proconsular Asia, was a centre of Grecian
   culture, commerce, and religion; famous of old for the songs of Homer,
   Anacreon, and Mimnermus, the philosophy of Thales, Anaximenes, and
   Anaximander, the worship and wonderful temple of Diana. There Paul had
   labored three years (54-57) and established an influential church, a
   beacon-light in the surrounding darkness of heathenism. From there he
   could best commune with the numerous churches he had planted in the
   provinces. There he experienced peculiar joys and trials, and foresaw
   great dangers of heresies that should spring up from within. [590] All
   the forces of orthodox and heretical Christianity were collected there.
   Jerusalem was approaching its downfall; Rome was not yet a second
   Jerusalem. Ephesus, by the labors of Paul and of John, became the chief
   theatre of church history in the second half of the first and during
   the greater part of the second century. Polycarp, the patriarchal
   martyr, and Irenaeus, the leading theologian in the conflict with
   Gnosticism, best represent the spirit of John and bear testimony to his
   influence. He alone could complete the work of Paul and Peter, and give
   the church that compact unity which she needed for her
   self-preservation against persecution from without and heresy and
   corruption from within.

   If it were not for the writings of John the last thirty years of the
   first century would be almost an entire blank. They resemble that
   mysterious period of forty days between the resurrection and the
   ascension, when the Lord hovered, as it were, between heaven and earth,
   barely touching the earth beneath, and appearing to the disciples like
   a spirit from the other world. But the theology of the second and third
   centuries evidently presupposes the writings of John, and starts from
   his Christology rather than from Paul's anthropology and soteriology,
   which were almost buried out of sight until Augustin, in Africa,
   revived them.

   John at Patmos.

   John was banished to the solitary, rocky, and barren island of Patmos
   (now Patmo or Palmosa), in the Aegean sea, southwest of Ephesus. This
   rests on the testimony of the Apocalypse, 1:9, as usually understood:
   "I, John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and
   kingdom and patience in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos,
   for (on account of) the word of God and the testimony of Jesus." [591]
   There he received, while "in the spirit, on the Lord's day," those
   wonderful revelations concerning the struggles and victories of
   Christianity.

   The fact of his banishment to Patmos is confirmed by the unanimous
   testimony of antiquity. [592] It is perpetuated in the traditions of
   the island, which has no other significance. "John--that is the thought
   of Patmos; the island belongs to him; it is his sanctuary. Its stones
   preach of him, and in every heart, he lives." [593]

   The time of the exile is uncertain, and depends upon the disputed
   question of the date of the Apocalypse. External evidence points to the
   reign of Domitian, a.d. 95; internal evidence to the reign of Nero, or
   soon after his death, a.d. 68.

   The prevailing--we may say the only distinct tradition, beginning with
   so respectable a witness as Irenaeus about 170, assigns the exile to
   the end of the reign of Domitian, who ruled from 81 to 96. [594] He was
   the second Roman emperor who persecuted Christianity, and banishment
   was one of his favorite modes of punishment. [595] Both facts give
   support to this tradition. After a promising beginning he became as
   cruel and bloodthirsty as Nero, and surpassed him in hypocrisy and
   blasphemous self-deification. He began his letters: "Our Lord and God
   commands," and required his subjects to address him so. [596] He
   ordered gold and silver statues of himself to be placed in the holiest
   place of the temples. When he seemed most friendly, he was most
   dangerous. He spared neither senators nor consuls when they fell under
   his dark suspicion, or stood in the way of his ambition. He searched
   for the descendants of David and the kinsmen of Jesus, fearing their
   aspirations, but found that they were poor and innocent persons. [597]
   Many Christians suffered martyrdom under his reign, on the charge of
   atheism--among them his own cousin, Flavius Clemens, of consular
   dignity, who was put to death, and his wife Domitilla, who was banished
   to the island of Pandateria, near Naples. [598] In favor of the
   traditional date may also be urged an intrinsic propriety that the book
   which closes the canon, and treats of the last things till the final
   consummation, should have been written last.

   Nevertheless, the internal evidence of the Apocalypse itself, and a
   comparison with the fourth Gospel, favor an earlier date, before the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and during the interregnum which followed the
   death of Nero (68), when the beast, that is the Roman empire, was
   wounded, but was soon to be revived (by the accession of Vespasian). If
   there is some foundation for the early tradition of the intended
   oil-martyrdom of John at Rome, or at Ephesus, it would naturally point
   to the Neronian persecution, in which Christians were covered with
   inflammable material and burned as torches. The unmistakable allusions
   to imperial persecutions apply much better to Nero than to Domitian.
   The difference between the Hebrew coloring and fiery vigor of the
   Apocalypse and the pure Greek and calm repose of the fourth Gospel, to
   which we have already alluded, are more easily explained if the former
   was written some twenty years earlier. This view has some slight
   support in ancient tradition, [599] and has been adopted by the
   majority of modern critical historians and commentators. [600]

   We hold, then, as the most probable view, that John was exiled to
   Patmos under Nero, wrote the Apocalypse soon after Nero's death, a.d.
   68 or 69, returned to Ephesus, completed his Gospel and Epistles
   several (perhaps twenty) years later, and fell asleep in peace during
   the year of Trajan, after a.d. 98.

   The faithful record of the historical Christ in the whole fulness of
   his divine-human person, as the embodiment and source of life eternal
   to all believers, with the accompanying epistle of practical
   application, was the last message of the Beloved Disciple at the
   threshold of the second century, at the golden sunset of the apostolic
   age. The recollections of his youth, ripened by long experience,
   transfigured by the Holy Spirit, and radiant with heavenly light of
   truth and holiness, are the most precious legacy of the last of the
   apostles to all future generations of the church.

   Eusebius, Jerome, etc. Leucius, also, the reputed author of the Acts of
   John about 130, in the fragments recently published by Zahn, bears
   witness to the residence of John in Ephesus and Patmos, and transfers
   his martyrdom from Rome to Ephesus. Lützelberger, Keim (Leben Jesu v.
   Nazara, I. 161 sq.), Holtzmann, Scholten, the author of Supernatural
   Religion, (II. 410), and other opponents of the Gospel of John, have
   dared to remove him out of Asia Minor with negative arguments from the
   silence of the Acts, the Ephesians, Colossians, Papias, Ignatius, and
   Polycarp, arguments which either prove nothing at all, or only that
   John was not in Ephesus before 63. But the old tradition has been
   conclusively defended not only by Ewald, Grimm, Steitz, Riggenbach,
   Luthardt, Godet, Weiss, but even by Krenkel, Hilgenfeld (Einleitung,
   pp. 395 sqq.), and Weizsäcker (498 sqq.), of the Tübingen school.

   [589] "The maintenance of evangelical truth," says Godet (I. 42),
   "demanded at that moment powerful aid. It is not surprising then that
   John, one of the last survivors amongst the apostles, should feel
   himself called upon to supply in those countries the place of the
   apostle of the Gentiles, and to water, as Apollos had formerly done in
   Greece, that which Paul had planted." Pressensé (Apost. Era, p. 424):
   "No city could have been better chosen as a centre from which to watch
   over the churches, and follow closely the progress of heresy. At
   Ephesus John was in the centre of Paul's mission field, and not far
   from Greece."

   [590] See his farewell address at Miletus, Acts 20:29, 30, and the
   Epistles to Timothy.

   [591] Bleek understands dia of the object: John was carried (in a
   vision) to Patmos for the purpose of receiving there the revelation of
   Christ He derives the whole tradition of John's banishment to Patmos
   from a misunderstanding of this passage. So also Lücke, De Wette,
   Reuss, and Düsterdieck. But the traditional exegesis is confirmed by
   the mention of the thlipsis, basileia and hupomone in the same verse,
   by the natural meaning of marturia, and by the parallel passages Rev.
   6:9 and 20:4, where dia likewise indicates the occasion or reason of
   suffering.

   [592] Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, Eusebius,
   Jerome, etc.

   [593] Tischendorf, Reise in's Morgenland, II.257 sq. A grotto on a hill
   in the southern part of the island is still pointed out as the place of
   the apocalyptic vision, and on the summit of the mountain is the
   monastery of St. John, with a library of about 250 manuscripts.

   [594] Irenaeus, Adv. Haer., V. 30, says that the Apocalypse was seen
   pros to telei tes Dometianou arches. So also Eusebius, H. E. III. 18,
   20, 33; Chron. ad ann. 14 Domitiani; and Jerome, De vir. illustr., c.
   9. This view has prevailed among commentators and historians till quite
   recently, and is advocated by Hengstenberg, Lange, Ebrard (and by
   myself in the Hist. of the Ap. Ch., § 101, pp. 400 sqq.). It is indeed
   difficult to set aside the clear testimony of Irenaeus, who, through
   Polycarp, was connected with the very age of John. But we must remember
   that he was mistaken even on more important points of history, as the
   age of Jesus, which he asserts, with an appeal to tradition, to have
   been above fifty years.

   [595] Tacitus congratulates Agricola (Vita Agr., c. 44) that he did not
   live to see under this emperor "tot consularium caedes, tot
   nobilissimarum feminarum exilia et fugas." Agricola, whose daughter
   Tacitus married, died in 93, two years before Domitian.

   [597] Hegesippus in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., III., 19, 20. Hegesippus,
   however, is silent about the banishment of John, and this silence has
   been used by Bleek as an argument against the fact.

   [598] Dion Cassius in the abridgment of Xiphilinus, 67, 14.

   [599] So the title of the Syriac translation of the Apocalypse (which,
   however, is of much later date than the Peshitto, which omits the
   Apocalypse): "Revelatio quam Deus Joanni Evangelistae in Patmo insula
   dedit, in quam a Nerone Caesare relegatus fuerat."Clement of Alexandria
   (Quis dives salv., c. 42, and quoted by Eusebius, III., 23) says
   indefinitely that John returned from Patmos to Ephesus after the death
   of "the tyrant" (tou turannou teleutesantos), which may apply to Nero
   as well as to Domitian. Origen mentions simply a Roman basileus.
   Tertullian's legend of the Roman oil-martyrdom of John seems to point
   to Nero rather than to any other emperor, and was so understood by
   Jerome (Adv. Jovin. I. 26), although Tertullian does not say so, and
   Jerome himself assigns the exile and the composition of the Apocalypse
   to the reign of Domitian (De vir. ill., c. 9). Epiphanius (Haer. LI.
   33) puts the banishment back to the reign of Claudius (a.d. 41-53),
   which is evidently much too early.

   § 43. Traditions Respecting John. [601]

   The memory of John sank deep into the heart of the church, and not a
   few incidents more or less characteristic and probable have been
   preserved by the early fathers.

   Clement of Alexandria, towards the close of the second century,
   represents John as a faithful and devoted pastor when, in his old age,
   on a tour of visitation, he lovingly pursued one of his former converts
   who had become a robber, and reclaimed him to the church.

   Irenaeus bears testimony to his character as "the Son of Thunder" when
   he relates, as from the lips of Polycarp, that, on meeting in a public
   bath at Ephesus the Gnostic heretic Cerinthus, [602] who denied the
   incarnation of our Lord, John refused to remain under the same roof,
   lest it might fall down. This reminds one of the incident recorded in
   Luke 9:49, and the apostle's severe warning in 2 John 10 and 11. The
   story exemplifies the possibility of uniting the deepest love of truth
   with the sternest denunciation of error and moral evil. [603]

   Jerome pictures him as the disciple of love, who in his extreme old age
   was carried to the meeting-place on the arms of his disciples, and
   repeated again and again the exhortation, "Little children, love one
   another," adding: "This is the Lord's command, and if this alone be
   done, it is enough." This, of all the traditions of John, is the most
   credible and the most useful.

   In the Greek church John bears the epithet "the theologian (theologos),
   for teaching most clearly the divinity of Christ (ten theoteta tou
   logou). He is also called "the virgin" (parthenos), [604] for his
   chastity and supposed celibacy. Augustin says that the singular
   chastity of John from his early youth was supposed by some to be the
   ground of his intimacy with Jesus. [605]

   The story of John and the huntsman, related by Cassian, a monk of the
   fifth century, represents him as gently playing with a partridge in his
   hand, and saying to a huntsman, who was surprised at it: "Let not this
   brief and slight relaxation of my mind offend thee, without which the
   spirit would flag from over-exertion and not be able to respond to the
   call of duty when need required." Childlike simplicity and playfulness
   are often combined with true greatness of mind.

   Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, at the close of the second century,
   relates (according to Eusebius) that John introduced in Asia Minor the
   Jewish practice of observing Easter on the 14th of Nisan, irrespective
   of Sunday. This fact entered largely into the paschal controversies of
   the second century, and into the modern controversy about the
   genuineness of the Gospel of John.

   The same Polycrates of Ephesus describes John as wearing the plate, or
   diadem of the Jewish high-priest (Ex. 28:36, 37; 39:30, 31). It is
   probably a figurative expression of priestly holiness which John
   attaches to all true believers (Comp. Rev. 2:17), but in which he
   excelled as the patriarch. [606]

   From a misunderstanding of the enigmatical word of Jesus, John 21:22,
   arose the legend that John was only asleep in his grave, gently moving
   the mound as he breathed, and awaiting the final advent of the Lord.
   According to another form of the legend he died, but was immediately
   raised and translated to heaven, like Elijah, to return with him as the
   herald of the second advent of Christ. [607]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [601] These traditions are reproduced in a pleasing manner by Dean
   Stanley, in his Sermons and Essays on the Apost. Age, pp. 266-281 (3d
   ed.). Comp. my Hist. of the Ap. Ch, pp. 404 sqq.

   [602] Or Ebion, according to Epiphanius, Haer., xxx. 25.

   [603] Stanley mentions, as an illustration of the magnifying influence
   of fancy, that Jeremy Taylor, in relating this story, adds that
   "immediately upon the retreat of the apostle the bath fell down and
   crushed Cerinthus in the ruins" (Life of Christ, Sect. xii. 2).

   [604] parthenos usually means a virgin (Matt. 1:23; Luke 1:27; Acts
   21:9; 1 Cor. 7:25; 28, 34), but is applied also to men who never
   touched women, Apoc. 14:4, and in patristic writers.

   [605] Augustin, Tract. 124 in Joh. Evang. (Opera III. 1976, ed. Migne)
   "Sunt qui senserint ... a Christo Joannem apostolum propterea plus
   amatum quod neque uxorem duxerit, et ab ineunte pueritui castissimus
   vixerit."He quotes Jerome, Contr. Jovin. l.c., but adds: "Hoc quidem in
   Scriptuis non evidenter apparet."According to Ambrosiaster, Ad 2 Cor.
   11:2, all the apostles were married except John and Paul. Tertullian
   calls John Christi spado.

   [606] In Euseb. H. E. III. 31, 3; V. 24, 3: Ioannes ...hos egennethe
   hiereus to petalon pephorekos -ikai-imartus kai-i` -ididaskalos houtos
   en Epheso, kekoimetai. Epiphanius reports (no doubt from Hegesippus)
   the same, with some ascetic features, of James the brother of the Lord.
   See Stanley's remarks, pp. 276-278, and Lightfoot on Galat., p. 345
   note, and Philipp. p. 252. "As a figurative expression," says
   Lightfoot, "or as a literal fact, the notice points to St. John as the
   veteran teacher, the chief representative, of a pontifical race. On the
   other hand, it is possible that this was not the sense which Polycrates
   himself attached to the figure or the fact; and if so, we have here
   perhaps the earliest passage in any extant Christian writing where the
   sacerdotal view of the ministry is distinctly put forward." But in the
   Didache (ch. 13) the Christian prophets are called "high priests."

   [607] Augustin mentions the legend, but contradicts it, Trad. 224 in
   Ev. Joann.

   § 44. The Power of Christianity.

   Practical Christianity is the manifestation of a new life; a spiritual
   (as distinct from intellectual and moral) life; a supernatural (as
   distinct from natural) life; it is a life of holiness and peace; a life
   of union and communion with God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; it
   is eternal life, beginning with regeneration and culminating in the
   resurrection. It lays hold of the inmost centre of man's personality,
   emancipates him from the dominion of sin, and brings him into vital
   union with God in Christ; from this centre it acts as a purifying,
   ennobling, and regulating force upon all the faculties of man--the
   emotions, the will, and the intellect--and transforms even the body
   into a temple of the Holy Spirit.

   Christianity rises far above all other religions in the theory and
   practice of virtue and piety. It sets forth the highest standard of
   love to God and to man; and this not merely as an abstract doctrine, or
   an object of effort and hope, but as a living fact in the person of
   Jesus Christ, whose life and example have more power and influence than
   all the maxims and precepts of sages and legislators. Deeds speak
   louder than words. Praecepta docent, exempla trahunt. The finest
   systems of moral philosophy have not been able to regenerate and
   conquer the world. The gospel of Christ has done it and is doing it
   constantly. The wisest men of Greece and Rome sanctioned slavery,
   polygamy, concubinage, oppression, revenge, infanticide; or they belied
   their purer maxims by their conduct. The ethical standard of the Jews
   was much higher; yet none of their patriarchs, kings, or prophets
   claimed perfection, and the Bible honestly reports the infirmities and
   sins, as well as the virtues, of Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, and
   Solomon.

   But the character of Christ from the manger to the cross is without
   spot or blemish; he is above reproach or suspicion, and acknowledged by
   friend and foe to be the purest as well as the wisest being that ever
   appeared on earth. He is the nearest approach which God can make to
   man, and which man can make to God; he represents the fullest
   imaginable and attain able harmony of the ideal and real, of the divine
   and human. The Christian church may degenerate in the hands of sinful
   men, but the doctrine and life of her founder are a never-failing
   fountain of purification.

   The perfect life of harmony with God and devotion to the welfare of the
   human race, is to pass from Christ to his followers. Christian life is
   an imitation of the life of Christ. From his word and spirit, living
   and ruling in the church, an unbroken stream of redeeming, sanctifying,
   and glorifying power has been flowing forth upon individuals, families,
   and nations for these eighteen centuries, and will continue to flow
   till the world is transformed into the kingdom of heaven, and God
   becomes all in all.

   One of the strongest proofs of the supernatural origin of Christianity,
   is its elevation above the natural culture and moral standard of its
   first professors. The most perfect doctrine and life described by
   unschooled fishermen of Galilee, who never before had been outside of
   Palestine, and were scarcely able to read and to write! And the
   profoundest mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, the incarnation,
   redemption, regeneration, resurrection, taught by the apostles to
   congregations of poor and illiterate peasants, slaves and freedmen! For
   "not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble" were
   called, "but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might
   put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the
   world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; and the
   base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God
   choose, yea, and the things that are not, that he might bring to naught
   the things that are: that no flesh should glory before God. But of him
   are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and
   righteousness and sanctification and redemption: that, according as it
   is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." [608]

   If we compare the moral atmosphere of the apostolic churches with the
   actual condition of surrounding Judaism and heathenism, the contrast is
   as startling as that between a green oasis with living fountains and
   lofty palm trees, and a barren desert of sand and stone. Judaism in its
   highest judicatory committed the crime of crimes, the crucifixion of
   the Saviour of the world, and hastened to its doom. Heathenism was
   fitly represented by such imperial monsters as Tiberius, Caligula,
   Nero, and Domitian, and exhibited a picture of hopeless corruption and
   decay, as described in the darkest colors not only by St. Paul, but by
   his heathen contemporary, the wisest Stoic moralist, the teacher and
   victim of Nero. [609]

   Notes.

   The rationalistic author of Supernatural Religion (vol. II. 487) makes
   the following remarkable concession: "The teaching of Jesus carried
   morality to the sublimest point attained, or even attainable, by
   humanity. The influence of his spiritual religion has been rendered
   doubly great by the unparalleled purity and elevation of his character.
   Surpassing in his sublime simplicity and earnestness the moral grandeur
   of Sâkya Muni, and putting to the blush the sometimes sullied, though
   generally admirable, teaching of Socrates and Plato, and the whole
   round of Greek philosophers, he presented the rare spectacle of a life,
   so far as we can estimate it, uniformly noble and consistent with his
   own lofty principles, so that the 'imitation of Christ' has become
   almost the final word in the preaching of his religion, and must
   continue to be one of the most powerful elements of its permanence."

   Lecky, likewise a rationalistic writer and historian of great ability
   and fairness, makes this weighty remark in his History of European
   Morals (vol. II. 9):, "It was reserved for Christianity to present to
   the world an ideal character, which through all the changes of eighteen
   centuries has inspired the hearts of men with an impassioned love; has
   shown itself capable of acting on all ages, nations, temperaments, and
   conditions; has been not only the highest pattern of virtue, but the
   strongest incentive to its practice, and has exercised so deep an
   influence that it may be truly said that the simple record of three
   short years of active life has done more to regenerate and to soften
   mankind than all the disquisitions of philosophers and all the
   exhortations of moralists. This has, indeed, been the wellspring of
   whatever is best and purest in Christian life. Amid all the sins and
   failings, amid all the priestcraft and persecution and fanaticism that
   have defaced the Church, it has preserved, in the character and example
   of its Founder, an enduring principle of regeneration."

   To this we may add the testimony of the atheistic philosopher, John
   Stuart Mill from his essay on Theism, written shortly before his death
   (1873), and published, 1874, in Three Essays on Religion. (Am. ed., p.
   253): "Above all, the most valuable part of the effect on the character
   which Christianity has produced, by holding up in a divine person a
   standard of excellence and a model for imitation, is available even to
   the absolute unbeliever, and can never more be lost to humanity. For it
   is Christ rather than God whom Christianity has held up to believers as
   the pattern of perfection for humanity. It is the God incarnate more
   than the God of the Jews, or of nature, who, being idealized, has taken
   so great and salutary a hold on the modem mind. And whatever else may
   be taken away from us by rational criticism, Christ is still left; a
   unique figure, not more unlike all his precursors than all his
   followers, even those who had the direct benefit of his personal
   teaching. It is of no use to say that Christ, as exhibited in the
   Gospels, is not historical, and that we know not how much of what is
   admirable has been super-added by the tradition of his followers. The
   tradition of followers suffices to insert any number of marvels, and
   may have inserted all the miracles which he is reputed to have wrought.
   But who among his disciples, or among their proselytes, was capable of
   inventing the sayings ascribed to Jesus, or of imagining the life and
   character revealed in the Gospels? Certainly not the fishermen of
   Galilee; as certainly not St. Paul, whose character and idiosyncrasies
   were of a totally different sort; still less the early Christian
   writers, in whom nothing is more evident than that the good which was
   in them was all derived, as they always professed that it was derived,
   from the higher source."

   Similar passages might be gathered from Thucydides, Aristophanes,
   Sallust, Horace, Juvenal, Persius, Tacitus, Suetonius. It is true that
   almost every heathen vice still exists in Christian countries, but they
   exist in spite of the Christian religion, while the heathen immorality
   was the legitimate result of idolatry, and was sanctioned by the
   example of the heathen gods, and the apotheosis of the worst Roman
   emperors.

   § 45. The Spiritual Gifts.

   Comp. the Commentaries on Rom. 12:3-9, and 1 Cor. 12-14.

   The apostolic church was endowed from the day of Pentecost with all the
   needful spiritual gifts for the moral regeneration of the world. They
   formed, as it were, her bridal garment and her panoply against Jewish
   and Gentile opposition. They are called charisms [610] or gifts of
   grace, as distinguished from, though not opposed to, natural
   endowments. They are certain special energies and manifestations of the
   Holy Spirit in believers for the common good. [611] They are
   supernatural, therefore, in their origin; but they correspond to
   natural virtues, and in operation they follow all the mental and moral
   faculties of Dian, raising them to higher activity, and consecrating
   them to the service of Christ. They all rest on faith, that "gift of
   gifts."

   The spiritual gifts may be divided into three classes: first,
   intellectual gifts of knowledge, mainly theoretical in their character,
   and concerned primarily with doctrine and theology; secondly, emotional
   gifts of feeling, appearing chiefly in divine worship and for immediate
   edification; and thirdly, practical gifts of will, devoted to the
   organization, government, and discipline of the church. They are not,
   however, abstractly separate, but work together harmoniously for the
   common purpose of edifying the body of Christ. In the New Testament ten
   charisms are specially mentioned; the first four have to do chiefly,
   though not exclusively, with doctrine, the next two with worship, and
   the remaining four with government and practical affairs.

   1. The gift of Wisdom and Knowledge, [612] or of deep insight into the
   nature and system of the divine word and the doctrines of the Christian
   salvation.

   2. The gift of Teaching. [613] or of practically applying the gift of
   knowledge; the power of clearly expounding the Scriptures for the
   instruction and edification of the people.

   3. The gift of Prophecy, [614] akin to the two preceding, but addressed
   rather to pious feeling than to speculative reflection, and employing
   commonly the language of higher inspiration, rather than that of
   logical exposition and demonstration. It is by no means confined to the
   prediction of future events, but consists in disclosing the hidden
   counsel of God, the deeper sense of the Scriptures, the secret state of
   the heart, the abyss of sin, and the glory of redeeming grace. It
   appears particularly in creative periods, times of mighty revival;
   while the gift of reaching suits better a quiet state of natural growth
   in the church. Both act not only in the sphere of doctrine and
   theology, but also in worship, and might in this view be reckoned also
   among the gifts of feeling.

   4. The gift of Discerning Spirits, [615] serves mainly as a guide to
   the third gift, by discriminating between true prophets and false,
   between divine inspiration and a merely human or satanic enthusiasm. In
   a wider sense it is a deep discernment in separating truth and error,
   and in judging of moral and religious character; a holy criticism still
   ever necessary to the purity of Christian doctrine and the
   administration of the discipline of the church.

   5. The gift of Tongues, [616] or of an utterance proceeding from a
   state of unconscious ecstasy in the speaker, and unintelligible to the
   hearer unless interpreted--thus differing from prophecy, which requires
   a self-conscious though highly elevated state of feeling, serves
   directly to profit the congregation, and is therefore preferred by
   Paul. [617] The speaking with tongues is an involuntary psalm-like
   prayer or song, uttered from a spiritual trance, and in a peculiar
   language inspired by the Holy Spirit. The soul is almost entirely
   passive, an instrument on which the Spirit plays his heavenly melodies.
   This gift has, therefore, properly, nothing to do with the spread of
   the church among foreign peoples and in foreign languages, but is
   purely an act of worship, for the edification primarily of the speaker
   himself, and indirectly, through interpretation, for the hearers. It
   appeared, first, indeed, on the day of Pentecost, but before Peter's
   address to the people, which was the proper mission-sermon; and we meet
   with it afterwards in the house of Cornelius and in the Corinthian
   congregation, as a means of edification for believers, and not, at
   least not directly, for unbelieving hearers, although it served to them
   as a significant sign, [618] arresting their attention to the
   supernatural power in the church.

   6. The gift of Interpretation [619] is the supplement of the
   glossolalia, and makes that gift profitable to the congregation by
   translating the prayers and songs from the language of the spirit and
   of ecstasy [620] into that of the understanding and of sober
   self-consciousness. [621] The preponderance of reflection here puts
   this gift as properly in the first class as in the second.

   7. The gift of Ministry and Help, [622] that is, of special
   qualification primarily for the office of deacon and deaconess, or for
   the regular ecclesiastical care of the poor and the sick, and, in the
   wide sense, for all labors of Christian charity and philanthropy.

   8. The gift of church Government and the Care of souls, [623]
   indispensable to all pastors and rulers of the church, above all to the
   apostles and apostolic men, in proportion to the extent of their
   respective fields of labor. Peter warns his co-presbyters against the
   temptation to hierarchical arrogance and tyranny over conscience, of
   which so many priests, bishops, patriarchs, and popes have since been
   guilty; and points them to the sublime example of the great Shepherd
   and Archbishop, who, in infinite love, laid down his life for the
   sheep. [624]

   9. The gift of Miracles [625] is the power possessed by the apostles
   and apostolic men, like Stephen, to heal all sorts of physical
   maladies, to cast out demons, to raise the dead, and perform other
   similar works, in virtue of an extraordinary energy or faith, by word,
   prayer, and the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus, and for his
   glory. These miracles were outward credentials and seals of the divine
   mission of the apostles in a time and among a people which required
   such sensible helps to faith. But as Christianity became established in
   the world, it could point to its continued moral effects as the best
   evidence of its truth, and the necessity for outward physical miracles
   ceased.

   10. Finally, the gift of Love, the greatest, most precious, most
   useful, most needful, and most enduring of all, described and extolled
   by St. Paul in the thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians with the pen of
   an angel in the vision and enjoyment of the God of infinite love
   himself. [626] Love is natural kindness and affection sanctified and
   raised to the spiritual sphere, or rather a new heavenly affection
   created in the soul by the experience of the saving love of God in
   Christ. As faith lies at the bottom of all charisms, so love is not
   properly a separate gift, but the soul of all the gifts, guarding them
   from abuse for selfish and ambitious purposes, making them available
   for the common good, ruling, uniting, and completing them. It alone
   gives them their true value, and without love even the speaking with
   tongues of angels, and a faith which removes mountains, are nothing
   before God. It holds heaven and earth in its embrace. It "believeth all
   things," and when faith fails, it "hopeth all things," and when hope
   fails, it "endureth all things," but it "never fails." As love is the
   most needful of all the gifts on earth, so it will also outlast all the
   others and be the ornament and joy of the saints in heaven. For love is
   the inmost essence, the heart, as it were, of God, the ground of all
   his attributes, and the motive of all his works. It is the beginning
   and the end of creation, redemption, and sanctification--the link which
   unites us with the triune God, the cardinal virtue of Christianity, the
   fulfilling of the law, the bond of perfectness, and the fountain of
   bliss.

   Tyndale, Cranmer, and Geneva Vers.) for "charity" (which came into
   James's Version from the Vulgate through the Rheims Vera.). This change
   has given great offence among conservative people. It may indeed
   involve a loss of rhythm in that wonderful chapter, but it was
   necessitated by the restricted meaning which charity has assumed in
   modem usage, being identical with practical benevolence, so that Paul
   might seem to contradict himself in 13:3 and 8. The Saxon word love is
   just as strong, as musical, and as sacred as the Latin charity, and its
   meaning is far more comprehensive and enduring, embracing both God's
   love to man and man'slove to God, and to his neighbor, both here and
   hereafter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 46. Christianity in Individuals.

   The transforming spiritual power of Christianity appears first in the
   lives of individuals. The apostles and primitive Christians rose to a
   morality and piety far above that of the heroes of heathen virtue and
   even that of the Jewish saints. Their daily walk was a living union
   with Christ, ever seeking the glory of God and the salvation of men.
   Many of the cardinal virtues, humility, for example, and love for
   enemies, were unknown before the Christian day.

   Peter, Paul, and John represent the various leading forms or types of
   Christian piety, as well as of theology. They were not without defect,
   indeed they themselves acknowledged only one sinless being, their Lord
   and Master, and they confessed their own shortcomings; [627] yet they
   were as nearly perfect as it is possible to be in a sinful world; and
   the moral influence of their lives and writings on all generations of
   the church is absolutely immeasurable. Each exhibits the spirit and
   life of Christ in a peculiar way. For the gospel does not destroy, but
   redeems and sanctifies the natural talents and tempers of men. It
   consecrates the fire of a Peter, the energy of a Paul, and the
   pensiveness of a John to the same service of God. It most strikingly
   displays its new creating power in the sudden conversion of the apostle
   of the Gentiles from a most dangerous foe to a most efficient friend of
   the church. Upon Paul the Spirit of God came as an overwhelming storm;
   upon John, as a gentle, refreshing breeze. But in all dwelt the same
   new, supernatural, divine principle of life. All are living apologies
   for Christianity, whose force no truth-loving heart can resist.

   Notice, too, the moral effects of the gospel in the female characters
   of the New Testament. Christianity raises woman from the slavish
   position which she held both in Judaism and in heathendom, to her true
   moral dignity and importance; makes her an heir of the same salvation
   with man, [628] and opens to her a field for the noblest and loveliest
   virtues, without thrusting her, after the manner of modern
   pseudo-philanthropic schemes of emancipation, out of her appropriate
   sphere of private, domestic life, and thus stripping her of her fairest
   ornament and peculiar charm.

   The Virgin Mary marks the turning point in the history of the female
   sex. As the mother of Christ, the second Adam, she corresponds to Eve,
   and is, in a spiritual sense, the mother of all living. [629] In her,
   the "blessed among women," the whole sex was blessed, and the curse
   removed which had hung over the era of the fall. She was not, indeed,
   free from actual and native sin, as is now, taught, without the
   slightest ground in Scripture, by the Roman church since the 8th of
   December, 1854. On the contrary, as a daughter of Adam, she needed,
   like all men, redemption and sanctification through Christ, the sole
   author of sinless holiness, and she herself expressly calls God her
   Saviour. [630] But in the mother and educator of the Saviour of the
   world we no doubt may and should revere, though not worship, the model
   of female Christian virtue, of purity, tenderness, simplicity,
   humility, perfect obedience to God, and unreserved surrender to Christ.
   Next to her we have a lovely group of female disciples and friends
   around the Lord: Mary, the wife of Clopas; Salome, the mother of James
   and John; Mary of Bethany, who sat at Jesus' feet; her busy and
   hospitable sister, Martha; Mary of Magdala, whom the Lord healed of a
   demoniacal possession; the sinner, who washed his feet with her tears
   of penitence and wiped them with her hair; and all the noble women, who
   ministered to the Son of man in his earthly poverty with the gifts of
   their love, [631] lingered last around his cross, [632] and were the
   first at his open sepulchre on the, morning of the resurrection. [633]

   Henceforth we find woman no longer a slave of man and tool of lust, but
   the pride and joy of her husband, the fond mother training her children
   to virtue and godliness, the ornament and treasure of the family, the
   faithful sister, the zealous servant of the congregation in every work
   of Christian charity, the sister of mercy, the martyr with superhuman
   courage, the guardian angel of peace, the example of purity, humility,
   gentleness, patience, love, and fidelity unto death. Such women were
   unknown before. The heathen Libanius, the enthusiastic eulogist of old
   Grecian culture, pronounced an involuntary eulogy on Christianity when
   he exclaimed, as he looked at the mother of Chrysostom: "What women the
   Christians have!"

   Charity. Lond., 1851; N. York, 1866.

   Thus raising the female sex to its true freedom and dignity,
   Christianity transforms and sanctifies the entire family life. It
   abolishes polygamy, and makes monogamy the proper form of marriage; it
   condemns concubinage with all forms of unchastity and impurity. It
   presents the mutual duties of husband and wife, and of parents and
   children, in their true light, and exhibits marriage as a copy of the
   mystical union of Christ with his bride, the church; thus imparting to
   it a holy character and a heavenly end. [634]

   Henceforth the family, though still rooted, as before, in the soil of
   nature, in the mystery of sexual love, is spiritualized and becomes a
   nursery of the purest and noblest virtues, a miniature church, where
   the father, as shepherd, daily leads his household into the pastures of
   the divine word, and, as priest, offers to the Lord the sacrifice of
   their common petition, intercession, thanksgiving, and praise.

   With the married state, the single also, as an exception to the rule,
   is consecrated by the gospel to the service of the kingdom of God; as
   we see in a Paul, a Barnabas, and a John, [635] and in the history of
   missions and of ascetic piety. The enthusiasm for celibacy, which
   spread so soon throughout the ancient church, must be regarded as a
   one-sided, though natural and, upon the whole, beneficial reaction
   against the rotten condition and misery of family life among the
   heathen.

   § 48. Christianity and Slavery.

   Literature.

   H. Wallon (Prof. of Modern History in Paris): Histoire de l'esclavage

   in the Orient, among the Greeks and the Romans, with an Introduction on
   modern negro slavery in the Colonies.

   vol. II., p. 348-470, an able discussion of the relation of
   Christianity and slavery.

   Compare the Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul to Philemon, especially
   Braune, and Lightfoot (in Colossians and Philemon, 1875).

   The numerous American works on slavery by Channing, Parker, Hodge,
   Barnes, Wilson, Cheever, Bledsoe, and others, relate to the question of
   negro slavery, now providentially abolished by the civil war of
   1861-65.

   To Christianity we owe the gradual extinction of slavery.

   This evil has rested as a curse on all nations, and at the time of
   Christ the greater part of the existing race was bound in beastly
   degradation--even in civilized Greece and Rome the slaves being more
   numerous than the free-born and the freedmen. The greatest philosophers
   of antiquity vindicated slavery as a natural and necessary institution;
   and Aristotle declared all barbarians to be slaves by birth, fit for
   nothing but obedience. According to the Roman law, "slaves had no head
   in the State, no name, no title, no register;" they had no rights of
   matrimony, and no protection against adultery; they could be bought and
   sold, or given away, as personal property; they might be tortured for
   evidence, or even put to death, at the discretion of their master. In
   the language of a distinguished writer on civil law, the slaves in the
   Roman empire "were in a much worse state than any cattle whatsoever."
   Cato the elder expelled his old and sick slaves out of house and home.
   Hadrian, one of the most humane of the emperors, wilfully destroyed the
   eye of one of his slaves with a pencil. Roman ladies punished their
   maids with sharp iron instruments for the most trifling offences, while
   attending half-naked, on their toilet. Such legal degradation and cruel
   treatment had the worst effect upon the character of the slaves. They
   are described by the ancient writers as mean, cowardly, abject, false,
   voracious, intemperate, voluptuous, also as hard and cruel when placed
   over others. A proverb prevailed in the Roman empire: "As many slaves,
   so many enemies." Hence the constant danger of servile insurrections,
   which more than once brought the republic to the brink of ruin, and
   seemed to justify the severest measures in self-defence.

   Judaism, indeed, stood on higher ground than this; yet it tolerated
   slavery, though with wise precautions against maltreatment, and with
   the significant ordinance, that in the year of jubilee, which
   prefigured the renovation of the theocracy, all Hebrew slaves should go
   free. [636]

   This system of permanent oppression and moral degradation the gospel
   opposes rather by its whole spirit than by any special law. It nowhere
   recommends outward violence and revolutionary measures, which in those
   times would have been worse than useless, but provides an internal
   radical cure, which first mitigates the evil, takes away its sting, and
   effects at last its entire abolition. Christianity aims, first of all,
   to redeem man, without regard to rank or condition, from that worst
   bondage, the curse of sin, and to give him true spiritual freedom; it
   confirms the original unity of all men in the image of God, and teaches
   the common redemption and spiritual equality of all before God in
   Christ; [637] it insists on love as the highest duty and virtue, which
   itself inwardly levels social distinctions; and it addresses the
   comfort and consolation of the gospel particularly to all the poor, the
   persecuted, and the oppressed. Paul sent back to his earthly master the
   fugitive slave, Onesimus, whom he had converted to Christ and to his
   duty, that he might restore his character where he had lost it; but he
   expressly charged Philemon to receive and treat the bondman hereafter
   as a beloved brother in Christ, yea, as the apostle's own heart. It is
   impossible to conceive of a more radical cure of the evil in those
   times and within the limits of established laws and customs. And it is
   impossible to find in ancient literature a parallel to the little
   Epistle to Philemon for gentlemanly courtesy and delicacy, as well as
   for tender sympathy with a poor slave.

   This Christian spirit of love, humanity, justice, and freedom, as it
   pervades the whole New Testament, has also, in fact, gradually
   abolished the institution of slavery in almost all civilized nations,
   and will not rest till all the chains of sin and misery are broken,
   till the personal and eternal dignity of man redeemed by Christ is
   universally acknowledged, and the evangelical freedom and brotherhood
   of men are perfectly attained.

   Note on the Number and Condition of Slaves in Greece and Rome.

   Attica numbered, according to Ctesicles, under the governorship of
   Demetrius the Phalerian (309 b.c.), 400,000 slaves, 10,000 foreigners,
   and only 21,000 free citizens. In Sparta the disproportion was still
   greater.

   As to the Roman empire, Gibbon estimates the number of slaves under the
   reign of Claudius at no less than one half of the entire population,
   i.e., about sixty millions (I. 52, ed. Milman, N. Y., 1850). According
   to Robertson there were twice as many slaves as free citizens, and
   Blair (in his work on Roman slavery, Edinb. 1833, p. 15) estimates over
   three slaves to one freeman between the conquest of Greece (146 b.c.)
   and the reign of Alexander Severna (a.d. 222-235). The proportion was
   of course very different in the cities and in the rural districts. The
   majority of the plebs urbana were poor and unable to keep slaves; and
   the support of slaves in the city was much more expensive than in the
   country. Marquardt assumes the proportion of slaves to freemen in Rome
   to have been three to two. Friedländer (Sittengeschichte Roms. l. 55,
   fourth ed.) thinks it impossible to make a correct general estimate, as
   we do not know the number of wealthy families. But we know that Rome
   a.d. 24 was thrown into consternation by the fear of a slave
   insurrection (Tacit. Ann. IV. 27). Athenaeus, as quoted by Gibbon (I.
   51) boldly asserts that he knew very many (pampolloi) Romans who
   possessed, not for use, but ostentation, ten and even twenty thousand
   slaves. In a single palace at Rome, that of Pedanius Secundus, then
   prefect of the city, four hundred slaves were maintained, and were all
   executed for not preventing their master's murder (Tacit. Ann. XIV. 42,
   43).

   The legal condition of the slaves is thus described by Taylor on Civil
   Law, as quoted in Cooper's Justinian, p. 411: "Slaves were held pro
   nullis, pro mortuis, pro quadrupedibus; nay, were in a much worse state
   than any cattle whatsoever. They had no head in the state, no name, no
   title, or register; they were not capable of being injured; nor could
   they take by purchase or descent; they had no heirs, and therefore
   could make no will; they were not entitled to the rights and
   considerations of matrimony, and therefore had no relief in case of
   adultery; nor were they proper objects of cognation or affinity, but of
   quasi-cognation only; they could be sold, transferred, or pawned, as
   goods or personal estate, for goods they were, and as such they were
   esteemed; they might be tortured for evidence, punished at the
   discretion of their lord, and even put to death by his authority;
   together with many other civil incapacities which I have no room to
   enumerate." Gibbon (I. 48) thinks that "against such internal enemies,
   whose desperate insurrections had more then once reduced the republic
   to the brink of destruction, the most severe regulations and the most
   cruel treatment seemed almost justifiable by the great law of
   self-preservation."

   The individual treatment of slaves depended on the character of the
   master. As a rule it was harsh and cruel. The bloody spectacles of the
   amphitheatre stupefied the finer sensibilities even in women. Juvenal
   describes a Roman mistress who ordered her female slaves to be
   unmercifully lashed in her presence till the whippers were worn out;
   Ovid warns the ladies not to scratch the face or stick needles into the
   naked arms of the servants who adorned them; and before Hadrian a
   mistress could condemn a slave to the death of crucifixion without
   assigning a reason. See the references in Friedländer, I. 466. It is
   but just to remark that the philosophers of the first and second
   century, Seneca, Pliny, and Plutarch, entertained much milder views on
   this subject than the older writers, and commend a humane treatment of
   the slaves; also that the Antonines improved their condition to some
   extent, and took the oft abused jurisdiction of life and death over the
   slaves out of private hands and vested it in the magistrates. But at
   that time Christian principles and sentiments already freely circulated
   throughout the empire, and exerted a silent influence even over the
   educated heathen. This unconscious atmospheric influence, so to speak,
   is continually exerted by Christianity over the surrounding world,
   which without this would be far worse than it actually is.

   § 49. Christianity and Society.

   Christianity enters with its leaven-like virtue the whole civil and
   social life of a people, and leads it on the path of progress in all
   genuine civilization. It nowhere prescribes, indeed, a particular form
   of government, and carefully abstains from all improper interference
   with political and secular affairs. It accommodates itself to
   monarchical and republican institutions, and can flourish even under
   oppression and persecution from the State, as the history of the first
   three centuries sufficiently shows. But it teaches the true nature and
   aim of all government, and the duties of rulers and subjects; it
   promotes the abolition of bad laws and institutions, and the
   establishment of good; it is in principle opposed alike to despotism
   and anarchy; it tends, under every form of government, towards order,
   propriety, justice, humanity, and peace; it fills the ruler with a
   sense of responsibility to the supreme king and judge, and the ruled
   with the spirit of loyalty, virtue, and piety.

   Finally, the Gospel reforms the international relations by breaking
   down the partition walls of prejudice and hatred among the different
   nations and races. It unites in brotherly fellowship and harmony around
   the same communion table even the Jews and the Gentiles, once so
   bitterly separate and hostile. The spirit of Christianity, truly
   catholic or universal, rises above all national distinctions. Like the
   congregation at Jerusalem, the whole apostolic church was of "one heart
   and of one soul." [638] It had its occasional troubles, indeed,
   temporary collisions between a Peter and a Paul, between Jewish and
   Gentile Christians; but instead of wondering at these, we must admire
   the constant victory of the spirit of harmony and love over the
   remaining forces of the old nature and of a former state of things. The
   poor Gentile Christians of Paul's churches in Greece sent their
   charities to the poor Jewish Christians in Palestine, and thus proved
   their gratitude for the gospel and its fellowship, which they had
   received from that mother church. [639] The Christians all felt
   themselves to be "brethren," were constantly impressed with their
   common origin and their common destiny, and considered it their sacred
   duty to "keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." [640]
   While the Jews, in their spiritual pride and "odium generis humani"
   abhorred all Gentiles; while the Greeks despised all barbarians as only
   half men; and while the Romans, with all their might and policy, could
   bring their conquered nations only into a mechanical conglomeration, a
   giant body without a soul; Christianity, by purely moral means) founded
   a universal spiritual empire and a communion of saints, which stands
   unshaken to this day, and will spread till it embraces all the nations
   of the earth as its living members, and reconciles all to God.

   § 50. Spiritual Condition of the Congregations.--The Seven Churches in
   Asia.

   We must not suppose that the high standard of holiness set up in
   doctrine and example by the evangelists and apostles was fully realized
   in their congregations. The dream of the spotless purity and perfection
   of the apostolic church finds no support in the apostolic writings,
   except as an ideal which is constantly held up before our vision to
   stimulate our energies. If the inspired apostles themselves disclaimed
   perfection, much less can we expect it from their converts, who had
   just come from the errors and corruptions of Jewish and heathen
   society, and could not be transformed at once without a miracle in
   violation of the ordinary laws of moral growth.

   We find, in fact, that every Epistle meets some particular difficulty
   and danger. No letter of Paul can be understood without the admission
   of the actual imperfection of his congregations. He found it necessary
   to warn them even against the vulgar sins of the flesh as well as
   against the refined sins of the spirit. He cheerfully and thankfully
   commended their virtues, and as frankly and fearlessly condemned their
   errors and vices.

   The same is true of the churches addressed in the Catholic Epistles,
   and in the Revelation of John. [641]

   The seven Epistles in the second and third chapters of the Apocalypse
   give us a glimpse of the church in its light and shade in the last
   stage of the apostolic age--primarily in Asia Minor, but through it
   also in other lands. These letters are all very much alike in their
   plan, and present a beautiful order, which has been well pointed out by
   Bengel. They contain (1) a command of Christ to write to the "angel" of
   the congregation. (2) A designation of Jesus by some imposing title,
   which generally refers to his majestic appearance (Rev. 1:13 sqq.), and
   serves as the basis and warrant of the subsequent promises and
   threatenings. (3) The address to the angel, or the responsible head of
   the congregation, be it a single bishop or the college of pastors and
   teachers. The angels are, at all events, the representatives of the
   people committed to their charge, and what was said to them applies at
   the same time to the churches. This address, or the epistle proper,
   consists always of (a) a short sketch of the present moral condition of
   the congregation--both its virtues and defects--with commendation or
   censure as the case may be; (b) an exhortation either to repentance or
   to faithfulness and patience, according to the prevailing character of
   the church addressed; (c) a promise to him who overcomes, together with
   the admonition: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
   saith unto the churches," or the same in the reverse order, as in the
   first three epistles. This latter variation divides the seven churches
   into two groups, one comprising the first three, the other the
   remaining four, just as the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the
   seven vials are divided. The ever-recurring admonition: "He that hath
   an ear," etc., consists of ten words. This is no unmeaning play, but an
   application of the Old Testament system of symbolical numbers, in which
   three was the symbol of the Godhead; four of the world or humanity; the
   indivisible number seven, the sum of three and four (as also twelve,
   their product), the symbol of the indissoluble covenant between God and
   man; and ten (seven and three), the round number, the symbol of fulness
   and completion.

   As to their moral and religious condition, the churches and the
   representatives fall, according to the Epistles, into three classes:

   1. Those which were predominantly good and pure, viz., those of Smyrna
   and Philadelphia. Hence, in the messages to these two churches we find
   no exhortation to repentance in the strict sense of the word, but only
   an encouragement to be steadfast, patient, and joyful under suffering.

   The church of Smyrna (a very ancient, still flourishing commercial city
   in Ionia, beautifully located on the bay of Smyrna) was externally poor
   and persecuted, and had still greater tribulation in view, but is
   cheered with the prospect of the crown of life. It was in the second
   century ruled by Polycarp, a pupil of John, and a faithful martyr.

   Philadelphia (a city built by king Attalus Philadelphus, and named
   after him, now Ala-Schär), in the province of Lydia, a rich wine
   region, but subject to earthquakes, was the seat of a church likewise
   poor and small outwardly, but very faithful and spiritually
   flourishing--a church which was to have all the tribulations and
   hostility it met with on earth abundantly rewarded in heaven.

   2. Churches which were in a predominantly evil and critical condition,
   viz., those of Sardis and Laodicea. Here accordingly we find severe
   censure and earnest exhortation to repentance.

   The church at Sardis (till the time of Croesus the flourishing capital
   of the Lydian empire, but now a miserable hamlet of shepherds) had
   indeed the name and outward form of Christianity, but not its inward
   power of faith and life. Hence it was on the brink of spiritual death.
   Yet Rev. 3:4 sq., distinguishes from the corrupt mass a few souls which
   had kept their walk undefiled, without, however, breaking away from the
   congregation as separatists, and setting up an opposition sect for
   themselves.

   The church of Laodicea (a wealthy commercial city of Phrygia, not far
   from Colosse and Hierapolis, where now stands only a desolate village
   by the name of Eski-Hissar) proudly fancied itself spiritually rich and
   faultless, but was in truth poor and blind and naked, and in that most
   dangerous state of indifference and lukewarmness from which it is more
   difficult to return to the former decision and ardor, than it was to
   pass at first from the natural coldness to faith. Hence the fearful
   threatening: "I will spew thee out of my mouth." (Lukewarm water
   produces vomiting.) Yet even the Laodiceans are not driven to despair.
   The Lord, in love, knocks at their door and promises them, on condition
   of thorough repentance, a part in the marriage-supper of the lamb
   (3:20).

   3. Churches of amixed character, viz., those of Ephesus, Pergamum, and
   Thyatira. In these cases commendation and censure, promise and
   threatening are united.

   Ephesus, then the metropolis of the Asian church, had withstood,
   indeed, the Gnostic errorists predicted by Paul, and faithfully
   maintained the purity of the doctrine delivered to it; but it had lost
   the ardor of its first love, and it is, therefore, earnestly exhorted
   to repent. It thus represents to us that state of dead, petrified
   orthodoxy, into which various churches oftentimes fall. Zeal for pure
   doctrine is, indeed, of the highest importance, but worthless without
   living piety and active love. The Epistle to the angel of the church of
   Ephesus is peculiarly applicable to the later Greek church as a whole.

   Pergamum in Mysia (the northernmost of these seven cities, formerly the
   residence of the kings of Asia of the Attalian dynasty, and renowned
   for its large library of 200,000 volumes and the manufacture of
   parchment; hence the name charta Pergamena;--now Bergamo, a village
   inhabited by Turks, Greeks, and Armenians) was the seat of a church,
   which under trying circumstances had shown great fidelity, but
   tolerated in her bosom those who held dangerous Gnostic errors. For
   this want of rigid discipline she also is called on to repent.

   The church of Thyatira (a flourishing manufacturing and commercial city
   in Lydia, on the site of which now stands a considerable Turkish town
   called Ak-Hissar, or "the White Castle," with nine mosques and one
   Greek church) was very favorably distinguished for self-denying, active
   love and patience, but was likewise too indulgent towards errors which
   corrupted Christianity with heathen principles and practices.

   The last two churches, especially that of Thyatira, form thus the exact
   counterpart to that of Ephesus, and are the representatives of a
   zealous practical piety in union with theoretical latitudinarianism. As
   doctrine always has more or less influence on practice, this also is a
   dangerous state. That church alone is truly sound and flourishing in
   which purity of doctrine and purity of life, theoretical orthodoxy and
   practical piety are harmoniously united and promote one another.

   With good reason have theologians in all ages regarded these, seven
   churches of Asia Minor as a miniature of the whole Christian church.
   "There is no condition, good, bad, or mixed, of which these epistles do
   not present a sample, and for which they do not give suitable and
   wholesome direction." Here, as everywhere, the word of God and the
   history of the apostolic church evince their applicability to all times
   and circumstances, and their inexhaustible fulness of instruction,
   warning, and encouragement for all states and stages of religious life.

   As the Christian Church rests historically on the Jewish Church, so
   Christian worship and the congregational organization rest on that of
   the synagogue, and cannot be well understood without it.

   The synagogue was and is still an institution of immense conservative
   power. It was the local centre of the religious and social life of the
   Jews, as the temple of Jerusalem was the centre of their national life.
   It was a school as well as a church, and the nursery and guardian of
   all that is peculiar in this peculiar people. It dates probably from
   the age of the captivity and of Ezra. [642] It was fully organized at
   the time of Christ and the apostles, and used by them as a basis of
   their public instruction. [643] It survived the temple, and continues
   to this day unaltered in its essential features, the chief nursery and
   protection of the Jewish nationality and religion. [644]

   The term "synagogue" (like our word church) signifies first the
   congregation, then also the building where the congregation meet for
   public worship. [645] Every town, however small, had a synagogue, or at
   least a place of prayer in a private house or in the open air (usually
   near a river or the sea-shore, on account of the ceremonial washings).
   Ten men were sufficient to constitute a religious assembly. "Moses from
   generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read
   in the synagogues every Sabbath." [646] To erect a synagogue was
   considered a work of piety and public usefulness. [647] In large
   cities, as Alexandria and Rome, there were many; in Jerusalem, about
   four hundred for the various sects and the Hellenists from different
   countries. [648]

   1. The building was a plain, rectangular ball of no peculiar style of
   architecture, and in its inner arrangement somewhat resembling the
   Tabernacle and the Temple. It had benches, the higher ones ("the
   uppermost seats") for the elders and richer members, [649] a
   reading-desk or pulpit, and a wooden ark or closet for the sacred rolls
   (called "Copheret" or Mercy Seat, also "Aaron"). The last corresponded
   to the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and the Temple. A sacred light
   was kept burning as a symbol of the divine law, in imitation of the
   light in the Temple, but there is no mention made of it in the Talmud.
   Other lamps were brought in by devout worshippers at the beginning of
   the Sabbath (Friday evening). Alms-boxes were provided near the door,
   as in the Temple, one for the poor in Jerusalem, another for local
   charities. Paul imitated the example by collecting alms for the poor
   Christians in Jerusalem.

   There was no artistic (except vegetable) ornamentation; for the second
   commandment strictly forbids all images of the Deity as idolatrous. In
   this, as in many other respects, the Mohammedan mosque, with its severe
   iconoclastic simplicity, is a second edition of the synagogue. The
   building was erected on the most elevated spot of the neighborhood, and
   no house was allowed to overtop it. In the absence of a commanding
   site, a tall pole from the roof rendered it conspicuous. [650]

   2. Organization.--Every synagogue had a president, [651] a number of
   elders (Zekenim) equal in rank, [652] a reader and interpreter, [653]
   one or more envoys or clerks, called "messengers" (Sheliach), [654] and
   a sexton or beadle (Chazzan) for the humbler mechanical services. [655]
   There were also deacons (Gabae zedaka) for the collection of alms in
   money and produce. Ten or more wealthy men at leisure, called Batlanim,
   represented the congregation at every service. Each synagogue formed an
   independent republic, but kept up a regular correspondence with other
   synagogues. It was also a civil and religious court, and had power to
   excommunicate and to scourge offenders. [656]

   3. Worship.--It was simple, but rather long, and embraced three
   elements, devotional, didactic, and ritualistic. It included prayer,
   song, reading, and exposition of the Scripture, the rite of
   circumcision, and ceremonial washings. The bloody sacrifices were
   confined to the temple and ceased with its destruction; they were
   fulfilled in the eternal sacrifice on the cross. The prayers and songs
   were chiefly taken from the Psalter, which may be called the first
   liturgy and hymn book.

   The opening prayer was called the Shema or Keriath Shema, and consisted
   of two introductory benedictions, the reading of the Ten Commandments
   (afterward abandoned) and several sections of the Pentateuch, namely,
   Deut. 6:4-9; 11:13-21; Num. 15:37-41. Then followed the eighteen
   prayers and benedictions (Berachoth). This is one of them: "Bestow
   peace, happiness, blessing, grace, mercy, and compassion upon us and
   upon the whole of Israel, thy people. Our Father, bless us all unitedly
   with the light of thy countenance, for in the light of thy countenance
   didst thou give to us, O Lord our God, the law of life, lovingkindness,
   justice, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. May it please thee to
   bless thy people lsrael at all times, and in every moment, with peace.
   Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace."
   These benedictions are traced in the Mishna to the one hundred and
   twenty elders of the Great Synagogue. They were no doubt of gradual
   growth, some dating from the Maccabean struggles, some from the Roman
   ascendancy. The prayers were offered by a reader, and the congregation
   responded "Amen." This custom passed into the Christian church. [657]

   The didactic and homiletical part of worship was based on the Hebrew
   Scriptures. A lesson from the Law (called parasha), [658] and one from
   the Prophets (haphthara) were read in the original, [659] and followed
   by a paraphrase or commentary and homily (midrash) in the vernacular
   Aramaic or Greek. A benediction and the "Amen" of the people closed the
   service.

   As there was no proper priesthood outside of Jerusalem, any Jew of age
   might get up to read the lessons, offer prayer, and address the
   congregation. Jesus and the apostles availed themselves of this
   democratic privilege to preach the gospel, as the fulfilment of the law
   and the prophets. [660] The strong didactic element which distinguished
   this service from all heathen forms of worship, had the effect of
   familiarizing the Jews of all grades, even down to the servant-girls,
   with their religion, and raising them far above the heathen. At the
   same time it attracted proselytes who longed for a purer and more
   spiritual worship.

   The days of public service were the Sabbath, Monday, and Thursday; the
   hours of prayer the third (9 a.m.), the sixth (noon), and the ninth (3
   p.m.). [661]

   The sexes were divided by a low wall or screen, the men on the one
   side, the women on the other, as they are still in the East (and in
   some parts of Europe). The people stood during prayer with their faces
   turned to Jerusalem.

   § 52. Christian Worship.

   Christian worship, or cultus, is the public adoration of God in the
   name of Christ; the celebration of the communion of believers as a
   congregation with their heavenly Head, for the glory of the Lord, and
   for the promotion and enjoyment of spiritual life. While it aims
   primarily at the devotion and edification of the church itself, it has
   at the same time a missionary character, and attracts the outside
   world. This was the case on the Day of Pentecost when Christian worship
   in its distinctive character first appeared.

   As our Lord himself in his youth and manhood worshipped in the
   synagogue and the temple, so did his early disciples as long as they
   were tolerated. Even Paul preached Christ in the synagogues of
   Damascus, Cyprus, Antioch in Pisidia, Amphipolis, Beraeea, Athens,
   Corinth, Ephesus. He "reasoned with the Jews every sabbath in the
   synagogues" which furnished him a pulpit and an audience.

   The Jewish Christians, at least in Palestine, conformed as closely as
   possible to the venerable forms of the cultus of their fathers, which
   in truth were divinely ordained, and were an expressive type of the
   Christian worship. So far as we know, they scrupulously observed the
   Sabbath, the annual Jewish feasts, the hours of daily prayer, and the
   whole Mosaic ritual, and celebrated, in addition to these, the
   Christian Sunday, the death and the resurrection of the Lord, and the
   holy Supper. But this union was gradually weakened by the stubborn
   opposition of the Jews, and was at last entirely broken by the
   destruction of the temple, except among the Ebionites and Nazarenes.

   In the Gentile-Christian congregations founded by Paul, the worship
   took from the beginning a more independent form. The essential elements
   of the Old Testament service were transferred, indeed, but divested of
   their national legal character, and transformed by the spirit of the
   gospel. Thus the Jewish Sabbath passed into the Christian Sunday; the
   typical Passover and Pentecost became feasts of the death and
   resurrection of Christ, and of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; the
   bloody sacrifices gave place to the thankful remembrance and
   appropriation of the one, all-sufficient, and eternal sacrifice of
   Christ on the cross, and to the personal offering of prayer,
   intercession, and entire self-consecration to the service of the
   Redeemer; on the ruins of the temple made without hands arose the never
   ceasing worship of the omnipresent God in spirit and in truth. [662] So
   early as the close of the apostolic period this more free and spiritual
   cultus of Christianity had no doubt become well nigh universal; yet
   many Jewish elements, especially in the Eastern church, remain to this
   day.

   § 53. The Several Parts of Worship.

   The several parts of public worship in the time of the apostles were as
   follows:

   1. The Preaching of the gospel. This appears in the first period mostly
   in the form of a missionary address to the unconverted; that is, a
   simple, living presentation of the main facts of the life of Jesus,
   with practical exhortation to repentance and conversion. Christ
   crucified and risen was the luminous centre, whence a sanctifying light
   was shed on all the relations of life. Gushing forth from a full heart,
   this preaching went to the heart; and springing from an inward life, it
   kindled life--a new, divine life--in the susceptible hearers. It was
   revival preaching in the purest sense. Of this primitive Christian
   testimony several examples from Peter and Paul are preserved in the
   Acts of the Apostles.

   The Epistles also may be regarded in the wider sense as sermons,
   addressed, however, to believers, and designed to nourish the Christian
   life already planted.

   2. The Reading of portions of the Old Testament, [663] with practical
   exposition and application; transferred from the Jewish synagogue into
   the Christian church. [664] To these were added in due time lessons
   from the New Testament; that is, from the canonical Gospels and the
   apostolic Epistles, most of which were addressed to whole congregations
   and originally intended for public use. [665] After the death of the
   apostles their writings became doubly important to the church, as a
   substitute for their oral instruction and exhortation, and were much
   more used in worship than the Old Testament.

   3. Prayer, in its various forms of petition, intercession, and
   thanksgiving. This descended likewise from Judaism, and in fact belongs
   essentially even to all heathen religions; but now it began to be
   offered in childlike confidence to a reconciled Father in the name of
   Jesus, and for all classes and conditions, even for enemies and
   persecutors. The first Christians accompanied every important act of
   their public and private life with this holy rite, and Paul exhorts his
   readers to "pray without ceasing." On solemn occasions they joined
   fasting with prayer, as a help to devotion, though it is nowhere
   directly enjoined in the New Testament. [666] They prayed freely from
   the heart, as they were moved by the Spirit, according to special needs
   and circumstances. We have an example in the fourth chapter of Acts.
   There is no trace of a uniform and exclusive liturgy; it would be
   inconsistent with the vitality and liberty of the apostolic churches.
   At the same time the frequent use of psalms and short forms of
   devotion, as the Lord's Prayer, may be inferred with certainty from the
   Jewish custom, from the Lord's direction respecting his model prayer,
   [667] from the strong sense of fellowship among the first Christians,
   and finally from the liturgical spirit of the ancient church, which
   could not have so generally prevailed both in the East and the West
   without some apostolic and post-apostolic precedent. The oldest forms
   are the eucharistic prayers of the Didache, and the petition for rulers
   in the first Epistle of Clement, which contrasts most beautifully with
   the cruel hostility of Nero and Domitian. [668]

   4. The Song, a form of prayer, in the festive dress of poetry and the
   elevated language of inspiration, raising the congregation to the
   highest pitch of devotion, and giving it a part in the heavenly
   harmonies of the saints. This passed immediately, with the psalms of
   the Old Testament, those inexhaustible treasures of spiritual
   experience, edification, and comfort, from the temple and the synagogue
   into the Christian church. The Lord himself inaugurated psalmody into
   the new covenant at the institution of the holy Supper, [669] and Paul
   expressly enjoined the singing of "psalms and hymns and spiritual
   songs," as a means of social edification. [670] But to this precious
   inheritance from the past, whose full value was now for the first time
   understood in the light of the New Testament revelation, the church, in
   the enthusiasm of her first love, added original, specifically
   Christian psalms, hymns, doxologies, and benedictions, which afforded
   the richest material for Sacred poetry and music in succeeding
   centuries; the song of the heavenly hosts, for example, at the birth of
   the Saviour; [671] the "Nunc dimittis" of Simeon; [672] the
   "Magnificat" of the Virgin Mary; [673] the "Benedictus" of Zacharias;
   [674] the thanksgiving of Peter after his miraculous deliverance; [675]
   the speaking with tongues in the apostolic churches, which, whether
   song or prayer, was always in the elevated language of enthusiasm; the
   fragments of hymns scattered through the Epistles; [676] and the
   lyrical and liturgical passages, the doxologies and antiphonies of the
   Apocalypse. [677]

   5. Confession Of Faith. All the above-mentioned acts of worship are
   also acts of faith. The first express confession of faith is the
   testimony of Peter, that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living
   God. The next is the trinitarian baptismal formula. Out of this
   gradually grew the so-called Apostles' Creed, which is also trinitarian
   in structure, but gives the confession of Christ the central and
   largest place. Though not traceable in its present shape above the
   fourth century, and found in the second and third in different longer
   or shorter forms, it is in substance altogether apostolic, and exhibits
   an incomparable summary of the leading facts in the revelation of the
   triune God from the creation of the world to the resurrection of the
   body; and that in a form intelligible to all, and admirably suited for
   public worship and catechetical use. We shall return to it more fully
   in the second period.

   6. Finally, the administration of the Sacraments, or sacred rites
   instituted by Christ, by which, under appropriate symbols and visible
   signs, spiritual gifts and invisible grace are represented, sealed, and
   applied to the worthy participators.

   The two sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, the antitypes of
   circumcision and the passover under the Old Testament, were instituted
   by Christ as efficacious signs, pledges, and means of the grace of the
   new covenant. They are related to each other as regeneration and
   sanctification, or as the beginning and the growth of the Christian
   life. The other religious rites mentioned in the New Testament, as
   confirmation and ordination, cannot be ranked in dignity with the
   sacraments, as they are not commanded by Christ.

   1. The Idea of Baptism. It was solemnly instituted by Christ, shortly
   before his ascension, to be performed in the name of the Father, the
   Son, and the Holy Spirit. It took the place of circumcision as a sign
   and seal of church membership. It is the outward mark of Christian
   discipleship, the rite of initiation into the covenant of grace. It is
   the sacrament of repentance (conversion), of remission of sins, and of
   regeneration by the power of the Holy Spirit. [678] In the nature of
   the case it is to be received but once. It incorporates the penitent
   sinner in the visible church, and entitles him to all the privileges,
   and binds him to all the duties of this communion. Where the condition
   of repentance and faith is wanting, the blessing (as in the case of the
   holy Supper, and the preaching of the Word) is turned into a curse, and
   what God designs as a savor of life unto life becomes, by the
   unfaithfulness of man, a savor of death unto death.

   The necessity of baptism for salvation has been inferred from John 3:5
   and Mark 16:16; but while we are bound to God's ordinances, God himself
   is free and can save whomsoever and by whatsoever means he pleases. The
   church has always held the principle that the mere want of the
   sacrament does not condemn, but only the contempt. Otherwise all
   unbaptized infants that die in infancy would be lost. This horrible
   doctrine was indeed inferred by St. Augustin and the Roman church, from
   the supposed absolute necessity of baptism, but is in direct conflict
   with the spirit of the gospel and Christ's treatment of children, to
   whom belongs the kingdom of heaven.

   The first administration of this sacrament in its full Christian sense
   took place on the birthday of the church, after the first independent
   preaching of the apostles. The baptism of John was more of a negative
   sort, and only preparatory to the baptism with the Holy Spirit. In
   theory Christian baptism is preceded by conversion, that is the human
   act of turning from sin to God in repentance and faith, and followed by
   regeneration, that is the divine act of forgiveness of sin and inward
   cleansing and renewal. Yet in practice the outward sign and inward
   state and effect do not always coincide; in Simon Magus we have an
   example of the baptism of water without that of the Spirit, and in
   Cornelius an example of the communication of the Spirit before the
   application of the water. In the case of infants, conversion, as a
   conscious act of the will, is impossible and unnecessary. In adults the
   solemn ordinance was preceded by the preaching of the gospel, or a
   brief instruction in its main facts, and then followed by more thorough
   inculcation of the apostolic doctrine. Later, when great caution became
   necessary in receiving proselytes, the period of catechetical
   instruction and probation was considerably lengthened.

   2. The usual Form of baptism was immersion. This is inferred from the
   original meaning of the Greek baptizein and baptismos; [679] from the
   analogy of John's baptism in the Jordan; from the apostles' comparison
   of the sacred rite with the miraculous passage of the Red Sea, with the
   escape of the ark from the flood, with a cleansing and refreshing bath,
   and with burial and resurrection; finally, from the general custom of
   the ancient church which prevails in the East to this day. [680] But
   sprinkling, also, or copious pouring rather, was practised at an early
   day with sick and dying persons, and in all such cases where total or
   partial immersion was impracticable. Some writers suppose that this was
   the case even in the first baptism of the three thousand on the day of
   Pentecost; for Jerusalem was poorly supplied with water and private
   baths; the Kedron is a small creek and dry in summer; but there are a
   number of pools and cisterns there. Hellenistic usage allows to the
   relevant expressions sometimes the wider sense of washing, bathing,
   sprinkling, and ceremonial cleansing. [681] Unquestionably, immersion
   expresses the idea of baptism, as a purification and renovation of the
   whole man, more completely than pouring or sprinkling; but it is not in
   keeping with the genius of the gospel to limit the operation of the
   Holy Spirit by the quantity or the quality of the water or the mode of
   its application. Water is absolutely necessary to baptism, as an
   appropriate symbol of the purifying and regenerating energy of the Holy
   Spirit; but whether the water be in large quantity or small, cold or
   warm, fresh or salt, from river, cistern, or spring, is relatively
   immaterial, and cannot affect the validity of the ordinance.

   3. As to the Subjects of baptism: the apostolic origin of infant
   baptism is denied not only by the Baptists, but also by many
   paedobaptist divines. The Baptists assert that infant baptism is
   contrary to the idea of the sacrament itself, and accordingly, an
   unscriptural corruption. For baptism, say they, necessarily presupposes
   the preaching of the gospel on the part of the church, and repentance
   and faith on the part of the candidate for the ordinance; and as
   infants can neither understand preaching, nor repent and believe, they
   are not proper subjects for baptism, which is intended only for adult
   converts. It is true, the apostolic church was a missionary church, and
   had first to establish a mother community, in the bosom of which alone
   the grace of baptism can be improved by a Christian education. So even
   under the old covenant circumcision was first performed on the adult
   Abraham; and so all Christian missionaries in heathen lands now begin
   with preaching, and baptizing adults. True, the New Testament contains
   no express command to baptize infants; such a command would not agree
   with the free spirit of the gospel. Nor was there any compulsory or
   general infant baptism before the union of church and state;
   Constantine, the first Christian emperor, delayed his baptism till his
   deathbed (as many now delay their repentance); and even after
   Constantine there were examples of eminent teachers, as Gregory
   Nazianzen, Augustin, Chrysostom, who were not baptized before their
   conversion in early manhood, although they had Christian mothers.

   But still less does the New Testament forbid infant baptism; as it
   might be expected to do in view of the universal custom of the Jews, to
   admit their children by circumcision on the eighth day after birth into
   the fellowship of the old covenant.

   On the contrary, we have presumptive and positive arguments for the
   apostolic origin and character of infant baptism, first, in the fact
   that circumcision as truly prefigured baptism, as the passover the holy
   Supper; then in the organic relation between Christian parents and
   children; in the nature of the new covenant, which is even more
   comprehensive than the old; in the universal virtue of Christ, as the
   Redeemer of all sexes, classes, and ages, and especially in the import
   of his own infancy, which has redeemed and sanctified the infantile
   age; in his express invitation to children, whom he assures of a title
   to the kingdom of heaven, and whom, therefore, he certainly would not
   leave without the sign and seal of such membership; in the words, of
   institution, which plainly look to the Christianizing, not merely of
   individuals, but of whole nations, including, of course, the children;
   in the express declaration of Peter at the first administration of the
   ordinance, that this promise of forgiveness of sins and of the Holy
   Spirit was to the Jews "and to their children;" in the five instances
   in the New Testament of the baptism of whole families, where the
   presence of children in most of the cases is far more probable than the
   absence of children in all; and finally, in the universal practice of
   the early church, against which the isolated protest of Tertullian
   proves no more, than his other eccentricities and Montanistic
   peculiarities; on the contrary, his violent protest implies the
   prevailing practice of infant baptism. He advised delay of baptism as a
   measure of prudence, lest the baptized by sinning again might forever
   forfeit the benefit of this ordinance; but he nowhere denies the
   apostolic origin or right of early baptism.

   We must add, however, that infant baptism is unmeaning, and its
   practice a profanation, except on the condition of Christian parentage
   or guardianship, and under the guarantee of a Christian education. And
   it needs to be completed by an act of personal consecration, in which
   the child, after due instruction in the gospel, intelligently and
   freely confesses Christ, devotes himself to his service, and is
   thereupon solemnly admitted to the full communion of the church and to
   the sacrament of the holy Supper. The earliest traces of confirmation
   are supposed to be found in the apostolic practice of laying on hands,
   or symbolically imparting the Holy Spirit. after baptism. [682]

   [678] Mark 1:4 (baptisma metanoias eis aphesin hamartion, said of
   John's baptism), 1:8, where John distinguishes his baptism, as a
   baptism by water (udati), from the baptism of Christ, as a baptism by
   the Holy Spirit (pneumati hagio); Matt. 3:1; Luke 3:16; John 1:33 (ho
   baptizon en pneumati hagio-i-i); Acts 2:38 (the first instance of
   Christian baptism, when Peter called on his hearers: Metanoesate, kai
   baptistheto ekastos humon en to onomati Iesou Chr. eis aphesin ton
   hamartion humon, kai lempsesthe ten dorean tous hagiou pneumatos);
   8:13; 11:16; 18:8 (episteuon kai ebaptizonto); Rom. 6:4 (baptisma eis
   t`on thanaton); Gal. 3:27 (eis Christon ebaptisthete). The metanoia was
   the connecting link between the baptism of John and that of Christ. The
   English rendering, "repentance" (retained in the Revision of 1881), is
   inaccurate (after the Latin paenitentia). The Greek means a change of
   mind, nous (a transmentation, as Coleridge proposed to call it), i.e.,
   an entire reformation and transformation of the inner life of man, with
   a corresponding outward change. It was the burden of the preaching of
   John the Baptist, and Christ himself, who began with the enlarged
   exhortation: Metanoeite kai pisteuete en to euangelio, Mark 1:15.

   [679] Comp. the German taufen, the English dip. Grimm defines baptizo
   (the frequentative of bapto): 'immergo, submergo;'Liddell and Scott:
   'to dip in or under the water.'But in the Sept. and the New Test. it
   has also a wider meaning. Hence Robinson defines it: 'to wash, to lave,
   to cleanse by washing.'See below.

   [680] The Oriental and the orthodox Russian churches require even a
   threefold immersion, in the name of the Trinity, and deny the validity
   of any other. They look down upon the Pope of Rome as an unbaptized
   heretic, and would not recognize the single immersion of the Baptists.
   The Longer Russian Catechism thus defines baptism: "A sacrament in
   which a man who believes, having his body thrice plunged in water in
   the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, dies to the
   carnal life of sin, and is born again of the Holy Ghost to a life
   spiritual and holy." Marriott (in Smith and Cheetham, I., 161) says:
   "Triple immersion, that is thrice dipping the head while standing in
   the water, was the all but universal rule of the church in early time,"
   and quotes in proof Tertullian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, Jerome,
   Leo I., etc. But he admits, on page 168 sq., that affusion and
   aspersion were exceptionally also used, especially in clinical baptism,
   the validity of which Cyprian defended (Ep. 76 or 69 ad Magnum). This
   mode is already mentioned in the Didache (ch. 7) as valid; see my book
   on the Did., third ed., 1889, pp. 29 sqq.

   Observe also the remarkable variation of reading in Matt. 7:4: ean me
   baptisontai (except they bathe themselves), and rhantisontai (sprinkle
   themselves). Westcott and Hort adopt the latter in the text, the former
   in the margin. The Revision of 1881 reverses the order. The 'divers
   baptisms' in Heb. 9:10 (in the Revision " washings") probably include
   all the ceremonial purifications of the Jews, whether by bathing (Lev.
   11:25; 14:9; Num. 19:7), or washing (Num. 19:7; Mark 7: 8), or
   sprinkling (Lev. 14:7; Num. 19:19). In the figurative phrase baptizein
   en pneumati hagio, to overwhelm, plentifully to endow with the Holy
   Spirit (Matt. 3:11; Luke 3:16; Mark 1:8; John 1: 3; Acts 1:5; 11:16),
   the idea of immersion is scarcely admissible since the Holy Spirit is
   poured out. See my Hist. of the Apost. Ch., p. 569.

   The sacrament of the holy Supper was instituted by Christ under the
   most solemn circumstances, when he was about to offer himself a
   sacrifice for the salvation of the world. It is the feast of the
   thankful remembrance and appropriation of his atoning death, and of the
   living union of believers with him, and their communion among
   themselves. As the Passover kept in lively remembrance the miraculous
   deliverance from the land of bondage, and at the same time pointed
   forward to the Lamb of God; so the eucharist represents, seals, and
   applies the now accomplished redemption from sin and death until the
   end of time. Here the deepest mystery of Christianity is embodied ever
   anew, and the story of the cross reproduced before us. Here the
   miraculous feeding of the five thousand is spiritually perpetuated.
   Here Christ, who sits at the right hand of God, and is yet truly
   present in his church to the end of the world, gives his own body and
   blood, sacrificed for us, that is, his very self, his life and the
   virtue of his atoning death, as spiritual food, as the true bread from
   heaven, to all who, with due self-examination, come hungering and
   thirsting to the heavenly feast. The communion has therefore been
   always regarded as the inmost sanctuary of Christian worship.

   In the apostolic period the eucharist was celebrated daily in
   connection with a simple meal of brotherly love (agape), in which the
   Christians, in communion with their common Redeemer, forgot all
   distinctions of rank, wealth, and culture, and felt themselves to be
   members of one family of God. But this childlike exhibition of
   brotherly unity became more and more difficult as the church increased,
   and led to all sorts of abuses, such as we find rebuked in the
   Corinthians by Paul. The lovefeasts, therefore, which indeed were no
   more enjoined by law than the community of goods at Jerusalem, were
   gradually severed from the eucharist, and in the course of the second
   and third centuries gradually disappeared.

   The apostle requires the Christians [683] to prepare themselves for the
   Lord's Supper by self-examination, or earnest inquiry whether they have
   repentance and faith, without which they cannot receive the blessing
   from the sacrament, but rather provoke judgment from God. This caution
   gave rise to the appropriate custom of holding special preparatory
   exercises for the holy communion.

   In the course of time this holy feast of love has become the subject of
   bitter controversy, like the sacrament of baptism and even the Person
   of Christ himself. Three conflicting theories--transubstantiation,
   consubstantiation, and spiritual presence of Christ-have been deduced
   from as many interpretations of the simple words of institution ("This
   is my body," etc.), which could hardly have been misunderstood by the
   apostles in the personal presence of their Lord, and in remembrance of
   his warning against carnal misconception of his discourse on the eating
   of his flesh. [684] The eucharistic controversies in the middle ages
   and during the sixteenth century are among the most unedifying and
   barren in the history of Christianity. And yet they cannot have been in
   vain. The different theories represent elements of truth which have
   become obscured or perverted by scholastic subtleties, but may be
   purified and combined. The Lord's Supper is: (1) a commemorative
   ordinance, a memorial of Christ's atoning sacrifice on the cross; (2) a
   feast of living union of believers with the Saviour, whereby they
   truly, that is spiritually and by faith, receive Christ, with all his
   benefits, and are nourished with his life unto life eternal; (3) a
   communion of believers with one another as members of the same mystical
   body of Christ; (4) a eucharist or thankoffering of our persons and
   services to Christ, who died for us that we might live for him.

   Fortunately, the blessing of the holy communion does not depend upon
   the scholastic interpretation and understanding of the words of
   institution, but upon the promise of the Lord and upon childlike faith
   in him. And therefore, even now, Christians of different denominations
   and holding different opinions can unite around the table of their
   common Lord and Saviour, and feel one with him and in him.

   previous discourse, whether it refers to the Lord's Supper, directly or
   indirectly, or not at all. That the esti in the words of institution
   may indicate a figurative or symbolical (as well as a real) relation,
   is now admitted by all critical exegetes; that it must be so understood
   in that connection is admitted by those who are not under the control

   § 56. Sacred Places.

   Although, as the omnipresent Spirit, God may be worshipped in all
   places of the universe, which is his temple, [685] yet our finite,
   sensuous nature, and the need of united devotion, require special
   localities or sanctuaries consecrated to his worship. The first
   Christians, after the example of the Lord, frequented the temple at
   Jerusalem and the synagogues, so long as their relation to the Mosaic
   economy allowed. But besides this, they assembled also from the first
   in private houses, especially for the communion and the love feast. The
   church itself was founded, on the day of Pentecost, in the upper room
   of an humble dwelling.

   The prominent members and first converts, as Mary, the mother of John
   Mark in Jerusalem, Cornelius in Caesarea, Lydia in Philippi, Jason in
   Thessalonica, Justus in Corinth, Priscilla in Ephesus, Philemon in
   Colosse, gladly opened their houses for social worship. In larger
   cities, as in Rome, the Christian community divided itself into several
   such assemblies at private houses, [686] which, however, are always
   addressed in the epistles as a unit.

   That the Christians in the apostolic age erected special houses of
   worship is out of the question, even on account of their persecution by
   Jews and Gentiles, to say nothing of their general poverty; and the
   transition of a whole synagogue to the new faith was no doubt very
   rare. As the Saviour of the world was born in a stable, and ascended to
   heaven from a mountain, so his apostles and their successors down to
   the third century, preached in the streets, the markets, on mountains,
   in ships, sepulchres, eaves, and deserts, and in the homes of their
   converts. But how many thousands of costly churches and chapels have
   since been built and are constantly being built in all parts of the
   world to the honor of the crucified Redeemer, who in the days of his
   humiliation had no place of his own to rest his head! [687]

   There is a very large Sabbath literature in the English language, of a

   Anglo-American Sabbath, New York, 1863 (in English and German), the
   publications of the New York Sabbath Committee from 1857-1886, the
   Sabbath Essays, ed. by Will. C. Wood, Boston (Congreg. Publ. Soc.),
   1879; and A. E. Waffle: The Lord's Day, Philad. 1886.

   As every place, so is every day and hour alike sacred to God, who fills
   all space and all time, and can be worshipped everywhere and always.
   But, from the necessary limitations of our earthly life, as well as
   from the nature of social and public worship, springs the use of sacred
   seasons. The apostolic church followed in general the Jewish usage, but
   purged it from superstition and filled it with the spirit of faith and
   freedom.

   1. Accordingly, the Jewish Hours of daily prayer, particularly in the
   morning and evening, were observed as a matter of habit, besides the
   strictly private devotions which are bound to no time.

   2. The Lord's Day took the place of the Jewish Sabbath as the weekly
   day of public worship. The substance remained, the form was changed.
   The institution of a periodical weekly day of rest for the body and the
   soul is rooted in our physical and moral nature, and is as old as man,
   dating, like marriage, from paradise. [688] This is implied in the
   profound saying of our Lord: "The Sabbath is made for man."

   It is incorporated in the Decalogue, the moral law, which Christ did
   not come to destroy, but to fulfil, and which cannot be robbed of one
   commandment without injury to all the rest.

   At the same time the Jewish Sabbath was hedged around by many national
   and ceremonial restrictions, which were not intended to be permanent,
   but were gradually made so prominent as to overshadow its great moral
   aim, and to make man subservient to the sabbath instead of the sabbath
   to man. After the exile and in the hands of the Pharisees it became a
   legal bondage rather than a privilege and benediction. Christ as the
   Lord of the Sabbath opposed this mechanical ceremonialism and restored
   the true spirit and benevolent aim of the institution. [689] When the
   slavish, superstitious, and self-righteous sabbatarianism of the
   Pharisees crept into the Galatian churches and was made a condition of
   justification, Paul rebuked it as a relapse into Judaism. [690]

   The day was transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week,
   not on the ground of a particular command, but by the free spirit of
   the gospel and by the power of certain great facts which he at the
   foundation of the Christian church. It was on that day that Christ rose
   from the dead; that he appeared to Mary, the disciples of Emmaus, and
   the assembled apostles; that he poured out his Spirit and founded the
   church; [691] and that he revealed to his beloved disciple the
   mysteries of the future. Hence, the first day was already in the
   apostolic age honorably designated as "the Lord's Day." On that day
   Paul met with the disciples at Troas and preached till midnight. On
   that day he ordered the Galatian and Corinthian Christians to make, no
   doubt in connection with divine service, their weekly contributions to
   charitable objects according to their ability. It appears, therefore,
   from the New Testament itself, that Sunday was observed as a day of
   worship, and in special commemoration of the Resurrection, whereby the
   work of redemption was finished. [692]

   The universal and uncontradicted Sunday observance in the second
   century can only be explained by the fact that it had its roots in
   apostolic practice. Such observance is the more to be appreciated as it
   had no support in civil legislation before the age of Constantine, and
   must have been connected with many inconveniences, considering the
   lowly social condition of the majority of Christians and their
   dependence upon their heathen masters and employers. Sunday thus
   became, by an easy and natural transformation, the Christian Sabbath or
   weekly day of rest, at once answering the typical import of the Jewish
   Sabbath, and itself forming in turn a type of the eternal rest of the
   people of God in the heavenly Canaan. [693] In the gospel dispensation
   the Sabbath is not a degradation, but an elevation, of the week days to
   a higher plane, looking to the consecration of all time and all work.
   It is not a legal ceremonial bondage, but rather a precious gift of
   grace, a privilege, a holy rest in God in the midst of the unrest of
   the world, a day of spiritual refreshing in communion with God and in
   the fellowship of the saints, a foretaste and pledge of the
   never-ending Sabbath in heaven.

   The due observance of it, in which the churches of England, Scotland,
   and America, to their incalculable advantage, excel the churches of the
   European continent, is a wholesome school of discipline, a means of
   grace for the people, a safeguard of public morality and religion, a
   bulwark against infidelity, and a source of immeasurable blessing to
   the church, the state, and the family. Next to the Church and the
   Bible, the Lord's Day is the chief pillar of Christian society.

   Besides the Christian Sunday, the Jewish Christians observed their
   ancient Sabbath also, till Jerusalem was destroyed. After that event,
   the Jewish habit continued only among the Ebionites and Nazarenes.

   As Sunday was devoted to the commemoration of the Saviour's
   resurrection, and observed as a day of thanksgiving and joy, so, at
   least as early as the second century, if not sooner, Friday came to be
   observed as a day of repentance, with prayer and fasting, in
   commemoration of the sufferings and death of Christ.

   3. Annual festivals. There is no injunction for their observance,
   direct or indirect, in the apostolic writings, as there is no basis for
   them in the Decalogue. But Christ observed them, and two of the
   festivals, the Passover and Pentecost, admitted of an easy
   transformation similar to that of the Jewish into the Christian
   Sabbath. From some hints in the Epistles, [694] viewed in the light of
   the universal and uncontradicted practice of the church in the second
   century it may be inferred that the annual celebration of the death and
   the resurrection of Christ, and of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
   originated in the apostolic age. In truth, Christ crucified, risen, and
   living in the church, was the one absorbing thought of the early
   Christians; and as this thought expressed itself in the weekly
   observance of Sunday, so it would also very naturally transform the two
   great typical feasts of the Old Testament into the Christian Easter and
   Whit-Sunday. The Paschal controversies of the second century related
   not to the fact, but to the time of the Easter festival, and Polycarp
   of Smyrna and Anicet of Rome traced their customs to an unimportant
   difference in the practice of the apostles themselves.

   Of other annual festivals, the New Testament contains not the faintest
   trace. Christmas came in during the fourth century by a natural
   development of the idea of a church year, as a sort of chronological
   creed of the people. The festivals of Mary, the Apostles, Saints, and
   Martyrs, followed gradually, as the worship of saints spread in the
   Nicene and post-Nicene age, until almost every day was turned first
   into a holy day and then into a holiday. As the saints overshadowed the
   Lord, the saints' days overshadowed the Lord's Day.

   89: "If references to the Fall are few and obscure, there can be no
   doubt that the Sabbath was an Accadian [primitive Chaldaean]
   institution, intimately connected with the worship of the seven
   planets. The astronomical tablets have shown that the seven-day week
   was of Accadian origin, each day of it being dedicated to the sun,
   moon, and five planets, and the word Sabbath itself, under the form of
   Sabattu, was known to the Assyrians, and explained by them as 'a day of
   rest for the heart.'A calendar of Saints' days for the month of the
   intercalary Elul makes the 7th, 14th, 19th, 2lst, and 28th days of the
   lunar months, Sabbaths on which no work was allowed to be done. The
   Accadian words by which the idea of Sabbath is denoted, literally mean:
   'a day on which work is unlawful,'and are interpreted in the bilingual
   tablets as signifying 'a day of peace or completion of labors.'" Smith
   then gives the rigid injunctions which the calendar lays down to the
   king for each of these sabbaths. Comp. also Transactions of Soc. for
   Bibl. Archaeol., vol. V., 427.

   Luke; also John 5:8 sqq.; 6:23; 9:14, 16.

   [690] Gal. 4:10; Comp. Rom. 14:5; Col. 2:16. The spirit of the
   pharisaical sabbatarianism with which Christ and St, Paul had to deal
   may be inferred from the fact that even Gamaliel, Paul's teacher, and
   one of the wisest and most liberal Rabbis, let his ass die on the
   Sabbath because he thought it a sin to unload him; and this was praised
   as an act of piety. Other Rabbis prohibited the saving of an ass from a
   ditch on the Sabbath, but allowed a plank to be laid so as to give the
   beast a chance to save himself. One great controversy between the
   schools of Shammai and Hillel turned around the mighty question whether
   it was lawful to eat an egg which was laid on the Sabbath day, and the
   wise Hillel denied it! Then it would be still more sinful to eat a
   chicken that had the misfortune to be born, or to be killed, on a
   Sabbath.

   but the church always celebrated it on a Sunday. See § 24, p. 241.

   CHAPTER X.

   ORGANIZATION OF THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 58. Literature.

   I. Sources.

   The Acts represent the first, the Pastoral Epistles the second stage of
   the apostolic church polity. Baur (Die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe des
   Ap. Paulus, 1835), Holtzmann (Die Pastoralbriefe, 1880, pp. 190 sqq.),
   and others, who deny the Pauline authorship of the Epistles to Timothy
   and Titus, date the organization laid down there from the
   post-apostolic age, but it belongs to the period from a.d. 60-70. The
   Epistles to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 12:28) and to the Ephesians (4:11),
   and the Apocalyptic Epistles (Rev. 2 and 3) contain important hints on
   the church offices.

   Comp. the Didache, and the Epp. of Clement and Ignatius.

   II. General Works.

   Comp. in part the works quoted in ch. IX. (especially Vitringa), and
   the respective sections in the "Histories of the Apostolic Age" by
   Neander Thiersch (pp. 73, 150, 281), Lechler, Lange, and Schaff, (Amer.
   ed, pp. 495-545).

   III. Separate Works.

   Episcopal and Presbyterian writers during the seventeenth century, and
   more recently, have paid most attention to this chapter, generally with
   a view of defending their theory of church polity.

   Richard Hooker (called "the Judicious," moderate Anglican, d. 1600):
   Ecclesiastical Polity, 1594, and often since, best edition by Keble,
   1836, in 4 vols. A standard work for Episcopal churchmen,

   Jos. Bingham (Anglican, d. 1668): Origines Ecclesiasticae; or, The
   Antiquities of the Christian Church, first published 1710-22, in 10
   vols. 8vo, and often since, Books; II.-IV. Still an important work.

   Thomas Cartwright (the father of English Presbyterianism, d. 1603).
   Directory o f Church Government anciently contended for, written in
   1583, published by authority of the Long Parliament in 1644.

   In the controversy during the Long Parliament and the Westminster
   Assembly, Bishop Hall and Archbishop Ussher were the most learned
   champions of episcopacy; while the five Smectymnians (so called from
   their famous tract Smectymnuus, 1641, in reply to Hall), i.e.,
   StephenMarshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and
   William Spurstow, were the most prominent Presbyterians trying to
   "demonstrate the parity of bishops and presbyters in Scripture, and the
   antiquity of ruling elders." See alsoA Vindication of the Presbyterian
   Government and Ministry, London, 1650, and Jus Divinum Ministerii
   Evangelici, or the Divine Right of the Gospel Ministry, London, 1654,
   both published by the Provincial Assembly of London. These books have
   only historical interest.

   § 59. The Christian Ministry, and its Relation to the Christian
   Community.

   Christianity exists not merely as a power or principle in this world,
   but also in an institutional and organized form which is intended to
   preserve and protect (not to obstruct) it. Christ established a visible
   church with apostles, as authorized teachers and rulers, and with two
   sacred rites, baptism and the holy communion, to be observed to the end
   of the world. [695]

   At the same time he laid down no minute arrangements, but only the
   simple and necessary elements of an organization, wisely leaving the
   details to be shaped by the growing and changing wants of the church in
   different ages and countries. In this respect Christianity, as a
   dispensation of the Spirit, differs widely from the Mosaic theocracy,
   as a dispensation of the letter.

   The ministerial office was instituted by the Lord before his ascension,
   and solemnly inaugurated on the first Christian Pentecost by the
   outpouring of the Holy Ghost, to be the regular organ of the kingly
   power of Christ on earth in founding, maintaining, and extending the
   church. It appears in the New Testament under different names,
   descriptive of its various functions:--the "ministry of the word," "of
   the Spirit," "of righteousness," "of reconciliation." It includes the
   preaching of the gospel, the administration of the sacraments, and
   church discipline or the power of the keys, the power to open and shut
   the gates of the kingdom of heaven, in other words, to declare to the
   penitent the forgiveness of sins, and to the unworthy excommunication
   in the name and by the authority of Christ. The ministers of the gospel
   are, in an eminent sense, servants of God, and, as such, servants of
   the churches in the noble spirit of self-denying love according to the
   example of Christ, for the eternal salvation of the souls intrusted to
   their charge. They are called--not exclusively, but emphatically--the
   light of the world, the salt of the earth, fellow-workers with God,
   stewards of the mysteries of God, ambassadors for Christ. And this
   unspeakable dignity brings with it corresponding responsibility. Even a
   Paul, contemplating the glory of an office, which is a savor of life
   unto life to believers and of death unto death to the impenitent,
   exclaims: "Who is sufficient for these things?" [696] and ascribes all
   his sufficiency and success to the unmerited grace of God.

   The internal call to the sacred office and the moral qualification for
   it must come from the Holy Spirit, [697] and be recognized and ratified
   by the church through her proper organs. The apostles were called,
   indeed, immediately by Christ to the work of founding the church; but
   so soon as a community of believers arose, the congregation took an
   active part also in all religious affairs. The persons thus inwardly
   and outwardly designated by the voice of Christ and his church, were
   solemnly set apart and inducted into their ministerial functions by the
   symbolical act of ordination; that is, by prayer and the laying on of
   the hands of the apostles or their representatives, conferring or
   authoritatively confirming and sealing the appropriate spiritual gifts.
   [698]

   Yet, high as the sacred office is in its divine origin and import, it
   was separated by no impassable chasm from the body of believers. The
   Jewish and later Catholic antithesis of clergy and laity has no place
   in the apostolic age. The ministers, on the one part, are as sinful and
   as dependent on redeeming grace as the members of the congregation; and
   those members, on the other, share equally with the ministers in the
   blessings of the gospel, enjoy equal freedom of access to the throne of
   grace, and are called to the same direct communion with Christ, the
   head of the whole body. The very mission of the church is, to reconcile
   all men with God, and make them true followers of Christ. And though
   this glorious end can be attained only through a long process of
   history, yet regeneration itself contains the germ and the pledge of
   the final perfection. The New Testament, looking at the principle of
   the now life and the high calling of the Christian, styles all
   believers "brethren," "saints," a "spiritual temple," a "peculiar
   people," a "holy and royal priesthood." It is remarkable, that Peter in
   particular should present the idea of the priesthood as the destiny of
   all, and apply the term clerus not to the ministerial order as distinct
   from the laity, but to the community; thus regarding every Christian
   congregation as a spiritual tribe of Levi, a peculiar people, holy to
   the Lord. [699]

   The temporal organization of the empirical church is to be a means (and
   not a hindrance, as it often is) for the actualization of the ideal
   republic of God when all Christians shall be prophets, priests, and
   kings, and fill all time and all space with his praise.

   Notes.

   1. Bishop Lightfoot begins his valuable discussion on the Christian
   ministry (p. 179) with this broad and liberal statement: "The kingdom
   of Christ, not being a kingdom of this world, is not limited by the
   restrictions which fetter other societies, political or religious. It
   is in the fullest sense free, comprehensive, universal. It displays
   this character, not only in the acceptance of all comers who seek
   admission, irrespective of race or caste or sex, but also in the
   instruction and treatment of those who are already its members. It has
   no sacred days or seasons, no special sanctuaries, because every time
   and every place alike are holy. Above all it has no sacerdotal system.
   It interposes no sacrificial tribe or class between God and man, by
   whose intervention alone God is reconciled and man forgiven. Each
   individual member holds personal communion with the Divine Head. To Him
   immediately he is responsible, and from Him directly he obtains pardon
   and draws strength."

   But he immediately proceeds to qualify this statement, and says that
   this is simply the ideal view--"a holy season extending the whole year
   round, a temple confined only by the limits of the habitable world, a
   priesthood co-extensive with the race"--and that the Church of Christ
   can no more hold together without officers, rules, and institutions
   than any other society of men. "As appointed days and set places are
   indispensable to her efficiency, so also the Church could not fulfil
   the purposes for which she exists without rulers and teachers, without
   a ministry of reconciliation, in short, without an order of men who may
   in some sense be designated a priesthood. In this respect the ethics of
   Christianity present an analogy to the politics. Here also the ideal
   conception and the actual realization are incommensurate and in a
   manner contradictory."

   2. Nearly all denominations appeal for their church polity to the New
   Testament, with about equal right and equal wrong: the Romanists to the
   primacy of Peter; the Irvingites to the apostles and prophets and
   evangelists, and the miraculous gifts; the Episcopalians to the
   bishops, the angels, and James of Jerusalem; the Presbyterians to the
   presbyters and their identity with the bishops; the Congregationalists
   to the independence of the local congregations and the absence of
   centralization. The most that can be said is, that the apostolic age
   contains fruitful germs for various ecclesiastical organizations
   subsequently developed, but none of them can claim divine authority
   except for the gospel ministry, which is common to all. Dean Stanley
   asserts that no existing church can find any pattern or platform of its
   government in the first century, and thus strongly contrasts the
   apostolic and post-apostolic organizations (l.c.): "It is certain that
   the officers of the apostolical or of any subsequent church, were not
   part of the original institution of the Founder of our religion; that
   of Bishop, Presbyter, and Deacon; of Metropolitan, Patriarch, and Pope,
   there is not the shadow of a trace in the four Gospels. It is certain
   that they arose gradually out of the preexisting institutions either of
   the Jewish synagogue, or of the Roman empire, or of the Greek
   municipalities, or under the pressure of local emergencies. It is
   certain that throughout the first century, and for the first years of
   the second, that is, through the later chapters of the Acts, the
   Apostolical Epistles, and the writings of Clement and Hermas. Bishop
   and Presbyter were convertible terms, and that the body of men
   so-called were the rulers--so far as any permanent rulers existed--of
   the early church. It is certain that, as the necessities of the time
   demanded, first at Jerusalem, then in Asia Minor, the elevation of one
   Presbyter above the rest by the almost universal law, which even in
   republics engenders a monarchial element, the word 'Bishop' gradually
   changed its meaning, and by the middle of the second century became
   restricted to the chief Presbyter of the locality. It is certain that
   in no instance were the apostles called 'Bishops' in any other sense
   than they were equally called 'Presbyters' and 'Deacons.' It is certain
   that in no instance before the beginning of the third century the title
   or function of the Pagan or Jewish priesthood is applied to the
   Christian pastors .... It is as sure that nothing like modern
   Episcopacy existed before the close of the first century as it is that
   nothing like modern Presbyterianism existed after the beginning of the
   second. That which was once the Gordian knot of theologians has at
   least in this instance been untied, not by the sword of persecution,
   but by the patient unravelment of scholarships."

   mediator between God and the people. Milton said rather sarcastically,
   "presbyter is priest writ large."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 60. Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists.

   The ministry originally coincided with the apostolate; as the church
   was at first identical with the congregation of Jerusalem. No other
   officers are mentioned in the Gospels and the first five chapters of
   the Acts. But when the believers began to number thousands, the
   apostles could not possibly perform all the functions of teaching,
   conducting worship, and administering discipline; they were obliged to
   create new offices for the ordinary wants of the congregations, while
   they devoted themselves to the general supervision and the further
   extension of the gospel. Thus arose gradually, out of the needs of the
   Christian church, though partly at the suggestion of the existing
   organization of the Jewish synagogue, the various general and
   congregational offices in the church. As these all have their common
   root in the apostolate, so they partake also, in different degrees, of
   its divine origin, authority, privileges, and responsibilities.

   We notice first, those offices which were not limited to any one
   congregation, but extended over the whole church, or at least over a
   great part of it. These are apostles, prophets, and evangelists. Paul
   mentions them together in this order. [700] But the prophecy was a gift
   and function rather than an office, and the evangelists were temporary
   officers charged with a particular mission under the direction of the
   apostles. All three are usually regarded as extraordinary officers and
   confined to the apostolic age; but from time to time God raises
   extraordinary missionaries (as Patrick, Columba, Boniface, Ansgar),
   divines (as Augustin, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Melancthon,
   Calvin), and revival preachers (as Bernard, Knox, Baxter, Wesley,
   Whitefield), who may well be called apostles, prophets, and evangelists
   of their age and nation. [701]

   1. Apostles. These were originally twelve in number, answering to the
   twelve tribes of Israel. In place of the traitor, Judas, Matthias was
   chosen by lot, between the ascension and Pentecost. [702] After the
   outpouring of the Holy Spirit, Paul was added as the thirteenth by the
   direct call of the exalted Saviour. He was the independent apostle of
   the Gentiles, and afterward gathered several subordinate helpers around
   him. Besides these there were apostolic men, like Barnabas, and James
   the brother of the Lord, whose standing and influence were almost equal
   to that of the proper apostles. The Twelve (excepting Matthias, who,
   however, was an eye-witness of the resurrection) and Paul were called
   directly by Christ, without human intervention, to be his
   representatives on earth, the inspired organs of the Holy Spirit, the
   founders and pillars of the whole church. Their office was universal,
   and their writings are to this day the unerring rule of faith and
   practice for all Christendom. But they never exercised their divine
   authority in arbitrary and despotic style. They always paid tender
   regard to the rights, freedom, and dignity of the immortal souls under
   their care. In every believer, even in a poor slave like Onesimus, they
   recognized a member of the same body with themselves, a partaker of
   their redemption, a beloved brother in Christ. Their government of the
   church was a labor of meekness and love, of self-denial and unreserved
   devotion to the eternal welfare of the people. Peter, the prince of the
   apostles, humbly calls himself a "fellow-presbyter," and raises his
   prophetic warning against the hierarchical spirit which so easily takes
   hold of church dignitaries and alienates them from the people.

   2. Prophets. These were inspired and inspiring teachers and preachers
   of the mysteries of God. They appear to have had special influence on
   the choice of officers, designating the persons who were pointed out to
   them by the Spirit of God in their prayer and fasting, as peculiarly
   fitted for missionary labor or any other service in the church. Of the
   prophets the book of Acts names Agabus, Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius,
   Manaen, and Saul of Tarsus, Judas and Silas. [703] The gift of prophecy
   in the wider sense dwelt in all the apostles, pre-eminently in John,
   the seer of the new covenant and author of the Revelation. It was a
   function rather than an office.

   3. Evangelists, itinerant preachers, delegates, and fellow-laborers of
   the apostles--such men as Mark, Luke, Timothy, Titus, Silas, Epaphras,
   Trophimus, and Apollos. [704] They may be compared to modern
   missionaries. They were apostolic commissioners for a special work. "It
   is the conception of a later age which represents Timothy as bishop of
   Ephesus, and Titus as bishop of Crete. St. Paul's own language implies
   that the position which they held was temporary. In both cases their
   term of office is drawing to a close when the apostle writes." [705]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [700] In Eph. 4:11, he adds "pastors and teachers." In 1 Cor. 12:28 he
   enumerates first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then
   powers, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues.
   Neither list is intended to be strictly methodical and exhaustive.

   [701] So Calvin, Inst. IV. ch. 3, § 4: "Secundum hanc interpretationem
   (qua mihi et verbis et sententiae Pauli consentanea videtur) tres iliae
   functiones [Apostoli, Prophetae, Evangelisttae]non ideo intitutae in
   ecclesia fuerunt, ut perpetuae forent, sed ad id modo tempus quo
   erigendae erant ecclesiae, ubi nullae ante fuerant, vel certe a Mose ad
   Christum traducendae. Quanquam non nego quin Apostolos postea quoque,
   vel saltem eorum loco Evangelistas interdum excitarit Deus, ut nostro
   tempore factum est."Most Protestant historians hold substantially the
   same view. The followers of the "Catholic Apostolic Church," usually
   called "Irvingites," claim to have apostles, prophets, evangelists
   raised up by the Lord himself in these last days preparatory to his
   Advent; but these "apostles" died one by one, and their places remain
   vacant. See my Hist. of the Ap. Church, pp. 516 sqq., and Creeds of
   Christendom, I. 905 sqq. In a very substantial sense the original
   apostles survive in their teaching, and need and can have no successors
   or substitutes.

   [702] Some commentators wrongly hold that the election of Matthias,
   made before the Pentecostal illumination, was a hasty and invalid act
   of Peter, and that Christ alone could fill the vacancy by a direct
   call, which was intended for Paul. But Paul never represents himself as
   belonging to the Twelve and distinguishes himself from them as their
   equal. See Gal., 1 and 2.

   Calvin takes the same view of the Evangelists, Inst. IV., ch. 3, § 4:
   "Per Evangelistas eos intelligo, qui quum dignitate essent Apostolis

   Quales fuerunt, Lucas, Timotheus, Titus, et reliqui similes: ac
   fortassis etiam septuaginta quos secundo ab Apostolis loco Christus
   designavit (Luc. 10. 1)."

   tradition (Euseb., H. E. III. 4; Const. Apost. VII. 46), regard Timothy
   and Titus as apostolic types of diocesan bishops. So Bishop Chr.

   § 61. Presbyters or Bishops. The Angels of the Seven Churches. James of
   Jerusalem.

   We proceed to the officers of local congregations who were charged with
   carrying forward in particular places the work begun by the apostles
   and their delegates. These were of two kinds, Presbyters or Bishops,
   and Deacons or Helpers. They multiplied in proportion as Christianity
   extended, while the number of the apostles diminished by death, and
   could, in the nature of the case, not be filled up by witnesses of the
   life and resurrection of Christ. The extraordinary officers were
   necessary for the founding and being of the church, the ordinary
   officers for its preservation and well-being.

   The terms Presbyter (or Elder) [706] and Bishop (or Overseer,
   Superintendent) [707] denote in the New Testament one and the same
   office, with this difference only, that the first is borrowed from the
   Synagogue, the second from the Greek communities; and that the one
   signifies the dignity, the other the duty. [708]

   1. The identity of these officers is very evident from the following
   facts:

   a. They appear always as a plurality or as a college in one and the
   same congregation, even in smaller cities) as Philippi. [709]

   b. The same officers of the church of Ephesus are alternately called
   presbyters [710] and bishops.

   c. Paul sends greetings to the "bishops" and "deacons" of Philippi, but
   omits the presbyters because they were included in the first term; as
   also the plural indicates. [711]

   d. In the Pastoral Epistles, where Paul intends to give the
   qualifications for all church officers, he again mentions only two,
   bishops and deacons, but uses the term presbyter afterwards for bishop.
   [712]

   Peter urges the "presbyters" to "tend the flock of God," and to "fulfil
   the office of bishops" with disinterested devotion and without "lording
   it over the charge allotted to them." [713]

   e. The interchange of terms continued in use to the close of the first
   century, as is evident from the Epistle of Clement of Rome (about 95),
   and the Didache, and still lingered towards the close of the second.
   [714]

   With the beginning of the second century, from Ignatius onward, the two
   terms are distinguished and designate two offices; the bishop being
   regarded first as the head of a congregation surrounded by a council of
   presbyters, and afterwards as the head of a diocese and successor of
   the apostles. The episcopate grew out of the presidency of the
   presbytery, or, as Bishop Lightfoot well expresses it: "The episcopate
   was formed, not out of the apostolic order by localization, but out of
   the presbyteral by elevation; and the title, which originally was
   common to all, came at length to be appropriated to the chief among
   them." [715] Nevertheless, a recollection of the original identity was
   preserved by the best biblical scholars among the fathers, such as
   Jerome (who taught that the episcopate rose from the presbyterate as a
   safeguard against schism), Chrysostom, and Theodoret. [716]

   The reason why the title bishop (and not presbyter) was given
   afterwards to the superior officer, may be explained from the fact that
   it signified, according to monumental inscriptions recently discovered,
   financial officers of the temples, and that the bishops had the charge
   of all the funds of the churches, which were largely charitable
   institutions for the support of widows and orphans, strangers and
   travellers, aged and infirm people in an age of extreme riches and
   extreme poverty. [717]

   2. The origin of the presbytero-episcopal office is not recorded in the
   New Testament, but when it is first mentioned in the congregation at
   Jerusalem, a.d. 44, it appears already as a settled institution. [718]
   As every Jewish synagogue was ruled by elders, it was very natural that
   every Jewish Christian congregation should at once adopt this form of
   government; this may be the reason why the writer of the Acts finds it
   unnecessary to give an account of the origin; while he reports the
   origin of the deaconate which arose from a special emergency and had no
   precise analogy in the organization of the synagogue. The Gentile
   churches followed the example, choosing the already familiar term
   bishop. The first thing which Paul and Barnabas did after preaching the
   gospel in Asia Minor was to organize churches by the appointment of
   elders. [719]

   3. The office of the presbyter-bishops was to teach and to rule the
   particular congregation committed to their charge. They were the
   regular "pastors and teachers." [720] To them belonged the direction of
   public worship, the administration of discipline, the care of souls,
   and the management of church property. They were usually chosen from
   the first converts, and appointed by the apostles or their delegates,
   with the approval of the congregation, or by the congregation itself,
   which supported them by voluntary contributions. They were solemnly
   introduced into their office by the apostles or by their fellow
   presbyters through prayers and the laying on of hands. [721]

   The presbyters always formed a college or corporation, a presbytery; as
   at Jerusalem, at Ephesus, at Philippi, and at the ordination of
   Timothy. [722] They no doubt maintained a relation of fraternal
   equality. The New Testament gives us no information about the division
   of labor among them, or the nature and term of a presidency. It is
   quite probable that the members of the presbyteral college distributed
   the various duties of their office among themselves according to their
   respective talents, tastes, experience, and convenience. Possibly, too,
   the president, whether temporary or permanent, was styled distinctively
   the bishop; and from this the subsequent separation of the episcopate
   from the presbyterate may easily have arisen. But so long as the
   general government of the church was in the hands of the apostles and
   their delegates, the bishops were limited in their jurisdiction either
   to one congregation or to a small circle of congregations.

   The distinction of "teaching presbyters" or ministers proper, and
   "ruling presbyters" or lay-elders, is a convenient arrangement of
   Reformed churches, but can hardly claim apostolic sanction, since the
   one passage on which it rests only speaks of two functions in the same
   office. [723] Whatever may have been the distribution and rotation of
   duties, Paul expressly mentions ability to teach among the regular
   requisites for the episcopal or presbyteral office. [724]

   4. The Angels of the Seven Churches in Asia Minor must be regarded as
   identical with the presbyter-bishops or local pastors. They represent
   the presiding presbyters, or the corps of regular officers, as the
   responsible messengers of God to the congregation. [725] At the death
   of Paul and Peter, under Nero, the congregations were ruled by a
   college of elders, and if the Apocalypse, as the majority of critical
   commentators now hold, was written before the year 70, there was too
   little time for a radical change of the organization from a republican
   to a monarchical form. Even if we regard the "angels" as single
   persons, they were evidently confined to a single church, and subject
   to St. John; hence, not successors of the apostles, as the latter
   diocesan bishops claim to be. The most that can be said is that the
   angels were congregational, as distinct from diocesan bishops, and mark
   one step from the primitive presbyters to the Ignatian bishops, who
   were likewise congregational officers, but in a monarchical sense as
   the heads of the presbytery, bearing a patriarchal relation to the
   congregation and being eminently responsible for its spiritual
   condition. [726]

   5. The nearest approach to the idea of the ancient catholic episcopate
   may be found in the unique position of James, the Brother of the Lord.
   Unlike the apostles, he confined his labors to the mother church of
   Jerusalem. In the Jewish Christian traditions of the second century he
   appears both as bishop and pope of the church universal. [727] But in
   fact he was only primus inter pares. In his last visit to Jerusalem,
   Paul was received by the body of the presbyters, and to them he gave an
   account of his missionary labors. [728] Moreover, this authority of
   James, who was not an apostle, was exceptional and due chiefly to his
   close relationship with the Lord, and his personal sanctity, which won
   the respect even of the unconverted Jews.

   The institution of episcopacy proper cannot be traced to the apostolic
   age, so far as documentary evidence goes, but is very apparent and
   well-nigh universal about the middle of the second century. Its origin
   and growth will claim our attention in the next period.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [706] The presbuteroi correspond to the Jewish zekenim; see above, §
   51. It was originally a term of age, and then of dignity, like
   Senators, Sennatus, gerousia (comp. our " Senate," "Alderman"), for the
   members of the governing body of a municipality or state. Aged and
   experienced men were generally chosen for office, but not without
   exceptions. Timothy was comparatively young when he was ordained (1
   Tim. 4:12). The Roman Senate consisted originally of venerable men, but
   after the time of Augustus the aetas senatoria was reduced to
   twenty-five. The use of presbyter in the sense ofsacerdos, hiereus,
   priest, dates from the time of Cyprian, and became common from the
   fifth century onward to the Reformation. In the New Test. there is no
   trace of any special sacerdotal office or caste.

   [707] The term episkoposoccurs about a dozen times in the Septuagint
   for various Hebrew words meaning " inspector," "taskmaster," "captain,"
   "president" (see Trommius, Concord. Gr. 492 LXX. Interpr. sub verbo,
   and also sub episkope and episkopeo). It was used in Egypt of the
   officers of a temple, in Greece of overseers or guardians in general,
   or of municipal and financial officers. In Athens the commissioners to
   regulate colonies and subject states were called episkopoi. The
   Spartans sent epimeletai in the same capacity. The term was not only
   applied to permanent officers, but also to the governing body, or a
   committee of the governing body. The feminine episkope is not
   classical, but passed from the Sept. into the Greek Test. (Acts 1:20; 1
   Tim. 3:1) and patristic usage with the meaning: the work or office of a
   bishop (inspectio, visitatio). See Lightfoot, Philippians, 93 sqq.,
   Gebhardt and Harnack, Patr. Apost. Op. p. 5; Hatch, l.c., 37 sqq., and
   Hatch, art. "Priest" in Smith and Cheetham, II. 1698 sqq.

   [708] The distinction between them, as two separate orders of
   ministers, dates from the second century, and is made a dogma in the
   Greek and Roman churches. The Council of Trent (Sess. XXIII., cap. 4,
   and can. vii. de sacramento ordinis) declares bishops to be successor
   of the apostles, and pronounces the anathema on those who affirm "that
   bishops are not superior to priests (presbyters)." Yet there are Roman
   Catholic historians who are learned and candid enough to admit the
   original identity. So Probst, Sacramente, p. 215; Döllinger (before his
   secession), First Age of the Church, Engl. transl. II. 111; and Kraus,
   Real-Encykl. der christl. Alterthümer (1880), I. 62. Kraus says:
   "Anfangs werden beide Termini [episkopos and presbuteros] vielfach mit
   demselben Werthe angewendet (Act 20:17, 28; Tit. 1:5; Clem. ad Cor. I.
   42, 44, 47). Noch im zweiten Jahrh. findet man die Bischöfe auch Gr.
   presbuteroi genannt, nicht aber umgekeht. Sofort fixirt sich dann der
   Sprachgebrauch: der B. ist der Vorsteher der paroikia, dioikesis ,als
   Nachfolger der Apostel; ihm unterstehen Volk und Geistlichkeit; ihm
   wohnt die Fülle der priesterlichen Gewalt inne."The sacerdotal idea,
   however, does not synchronize with the elevation of the episcopate, but
   came in a little later.

   [709] The only apparent exceptions are 1 Tim. 3:2; Tit. 1:7, but there
   the definite article before episkoposis generic.

   [710] Acts 20:17 (presbyters), 28 (bishops). In the English version the
   argument of the identity is obscured by the exceptional translation
   "overseers," instead of the usual "bishops." The Revised Version of
   1881 has mended this defect by adopting "elders" and "bishops" in the
   text, and "presbyters" and "overseers" in the margin. The perversion of
   the passage, under the unconscious influence of a later distinction,
   began with Irenaeus, who says (Adv. Haer. III. 14, 2): "The bishops and
   presbyters were called together (convocatis episcopis et presbyter) at
   Miletus from Ephesus, and the other neighboring cities (et a reliquis
   proximis civitatibus)."The last addition was necessary to justify the
   plurality of bishops as distinct from presbyters. The latter alone are
   mentioned, Acts 20:17.

   [711] Phil. 1:1: pasin tois hagiois ... sun episkopois kai diakonois

   [712] 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 5:17-19; Tit. 1:5-7.

   [713] 1 Pet. 5:1, 2: presbuterous ... parakalo ho sunpresbuteros?
   poimanate to en humin poimnion tou theou, episkopountes ... The last
   word is omitted by ' and B. Tischendorf (8th ed.), Westcott and Hort,
   but poimanate implies the episcopal function, the oversight of the
   flock.

   [714] Clem., Ad Cor. c. 42 ("bishops and deacons "), c. 44 ("bishopric
   ... the presbyters"). The Didache (ch. 15) knows only bishops and
   deacons, as local officers, the former being identical with presbyters.
   Irenaeus still occasionally calls the bishops "presbyters," and uses
   sussiones episcoporum and successiones presbyterorum synonymously, but
   he evidently recognized the episcopal constitution. The higher office
   includes the lower, but not conversely.

   [715] L. c., p. 194. He illustrates this usage by a parallel instance
   from the Athenian institutions. Neander has the same view of the origin
   of the episcopate. It dates, in fact, from Jerome.

   [716] See the patristic quotations in my Hist. of the Ap. Ch. pp. 524
   sq. Even Pope Urban II. (a.d. 1091) says that the primitive church knew
   only two orders, the deaconate and the presbyterate. The original
   identity of presbyter and bishop is not only insisted on by
   Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Congregationalists, but freely conceded
   also by Episcopal commentators, as Whitby, Bloomfield, Conybeare and
   Howson, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Stanley, and others. It is also
   conceded by purely critical historians, as Rothe, Ritschl, Baur (K
   Gesch I. 270), and Renan (Les Evangiles, p. 332). Renan calls the
   history of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the history of a triple
   abdication: first the community of believers committed their power to
   the presbyters, then the corps of presbyters abdicated to the bishop,
   and, last, the bishops to the pope (in the Vatican council). "La
   création de l'épiscopat est l'aeuvre du IIe siècle. L'absorption de
   l'Eglise par les 'presbyteri'est un fait accompli avant la fin du
   premier. Dans l'èpître de Clément Romain, etc., ce n'est pas encore
   l'épiscopat, c'est le presbytérat qui est en cause. On n'y trouve pas
   trace d'un 'presbyteros''supérieur aux autres et devant détrôner les
   autres. Mais l'auteur proclame hautement que le presbytérat, to clergé,
   est antérieur au peuple." Comp. also Renan's Saint Paul, 238 sq., and
   L'Eglise Chrétienne, ch. VI. p. 85 sqq. This subject then may be
   regarded as finally settled among scholars. At the same time it should
   in all fairness be admitted that the tendency toward an episcopal
   concentration of presbyteral power may be traced to the close of the
   apostolic age.

   [717] See Hatch, Organiz. Lect. II. and IV., and his art. "Priest" in
   Smith and Cheetham, II. 1700. Hatch makes large use of the inscriptions
   found at Salkhad, in the Haurân, at Thera, and elsewhere. He advances
   the new theory that the bishops were originally a higher order of
   deacons and supreme almoners of the sovereign congregation, while the
   presbyters had charge of the discipline. He admits that bishops and
   presbyters were equals in rank, and their names interchangeable, but
   that their relations differed in different churches during the first
   two centuries, and that the chief function of the bishop originally was
   the care and disposition of the charitable funds. Hence the stress laid
   by Paul on the necessity of a bishop being aphilarguros and philozenos
   . In the long series of ecclesiastical canons and imperial edicts, the
   bishops are represented especially in the light of trustees of church
   property.

   sent a collection to the elders for their brethren in Judaea.

   [723] 1 Tim. 5:17: "Let the elders that rule well (hoi kalos proestotes
   presbuteroi) be counted of double honor ( diples times), especially
   those who labor in the word and in teaching (en logo kai didaskalia)."
   Some commentators emphasize kalos, some refer the " double honor" to
   higher rank and position, others to better remuneration, still others
   to both.

   [724] 1 Tim. 3:2: "The bishop must be ... apt to teach (didaktikon)."
   The same is implied in Tit. 1:9; Act 20:28; and Heb. 13:17. Lightfoot
   takes the right view (p. 192): "Though government was probably the
   first conception of the office, yet the work of teaching must have
   fallen to the presbyters from the very first and have assumed greater
   prominence as time went on." On the question of teaching and ruling
   elders, compare, besides other treatises, Peter Colin Campbell: The
   Theory of Ruling Eldership (Edinb. and London, 1866), and two able
   articles by Dr. R. D. Hitchcock and Dr. E. F. Hatfield (both
   Presbyterians) in the "American Presbyterian Review" for April and
   October, 1868. All these writers dissent from Calvin's interpretation
   of 1 Tim. 5:17, as teaching two kinds of presbyters: (1) those who both
   taught and ruled, and (2) those who ruled only; but Campbell pleads
   from 1 Cor. 12:28; Rom. 12:8; and Acts 15:22, 25 for what he calls "Lay
   Assessors." Dr. Hitchcock holds that the primitive presbyters were
   empowered and expected both to teach and to rule. Dr. Hatfield tries to
   prove that the Christian presbyters, like the Jewish elders, were only
   to rule; the office of teaching having been committed to the apostles,
   evangelists, and other missionaries. The last was also the view of Dr.
   Thornwell, of South Carolina (on Ruling Elders), and is advocated in a
   modified form by an Oxford scholar of great ability, Vice-Principal
   Hatch (l.c. Lecture III. pp. 35 sqq., and art ."Priest" in Smith and
   Cheetham, II. 1700). He holds that the Christian presbyters, like the
   Jewish, were at first chiefly officers of discipline, not of worship,
   and that the fitness for teaching and soundness in the faith were
   altogether subordinate to the moral qualities which are necessary to a
   governor. He also remarks (p. 1707) that neither Clement nor Ignatius
   makes any mention of presbyters in connection with teaching, and that
   teaching was a delegated function committed to the wiser presbyters.

   [725] Other interpretations of the apocalyptic angels: 1. Heavenly
   messengers, guardian angels of the several churches. Origen. Jerome, De
   Wette, Alford, Bishop Lightfoot. 2. Deputies or clerks of the churches,
   corresponding to the shelichai of the synagogues. Vitringa, John
   Lightfoot, Bengel, Winer. 3. Figurative personifications of the
   churches. Arethas, Salmasius. 4. Bishops proper. See my Hist. of the Ap
   Ch. pp. 537 sqq.

   [726] Rothe, Bunsen, Thiersch, and Bishop Lightfoot trace the
   institution of episcopacy to the Gentile churches in Asia Minor, and
   claim for it some sanction of the surviving apostle John during the
   mysterious period between a.d. 70 and 100. Neander, Baur, and Ritschl
   opposed Rothe's theory (which created considerable sensation in learned
   circles at the time). Rothe was not an Episcopalian, but regarded
   episcopacy as a temporary historical necessity in the ancient church.

   § 62. Deacons and Deaconesses.

   Deacons, [729] or helpers, appear first in the church of Jerusalem,
   seven in number. The author of the Acts 6 gives us an account of the
   origin of this office, which is mentioned before that of the
   presbyters. It had a precedent in the officers of the synagogue who had
   charge of the collection and distribution of alms. [730] It was the
   first relief of the heavy burden that rested on the shoulders of the
   apostles, who wished to devote themselves exclusively to prayer and the
   ministry of the word. It was occasioned by a complaint of the
   Hellenistic Christians against the Hebrew or Palestinian brethren, that
   their widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food (and
   perhaps money). In the exercise of a truly fraternal spirit the
   congregation elected seven Hellenists instead of Hebrews, if we are to
   judge from their Greek names, although they were not uncommon among the
   Jews in that age. After the popular election they were ordained by the
   apostles.

   The example of the mother church was followed in all other
   congregations, though without particular regard to the number. The
   church of Rome, however, perpetuated even the number seven for several
   generations. [731] In Philippi the deacons took their rank after the
   presbyters, and are addressed with them in Paul's Epistle.

   The office of there deacons, according to the narrative in Acts, was to
   minister at the table in the daily love-feasts, and to attend to the
   wants of the poor and the sick. The primitive churches were charitable
   societies, taking care of the widows and orphans, dispensing
   hospitality to strangers, and relieving the needs of the poor. The
   presbyters were the custodians, the deacons the collectors and
   distributors, of the charitable funds. To this work a kind of pastoral
   care of souls very naturally attached itself, since poverty and
   sickness afford the best occasions and the most urgent demand for
   edifying instruction and consolation. Hence, living faith and exemplary
   conduct were necessary qualifications for the office of deacon. [732]

   Two of the Jerusalem deacons, Stephen and Philip, labored also as
   preachers and evangelists, but in the exercise of a personal gift
   rather than of official duty.

   In post-apostolic times, when the bishop was raised above the presbyter
   and the presbyter became priest, the deacon was regarded as Levite, and
   his primary function of care of the poor was lost in the function of
   assisting the priest in the subordinate parts of public worship and the
   administration of the sacraments. The diaconate became the first of the
   three orders of the ministry and a stepping-stone to the priesthood. At
   the same time the deacon, by his intimacy with the bishop as his agent
   and messenger, acquired an advantage over the priest.

   Deaconesses, [733] or female helpers, had a similar charge of the poor
   and sick in the female portion of the church. This office was the more
   needful on account of the rigid separation of the sexes at that day,
   especially among the Greeks and Orientals. It opened to pious women and
   virgins, and chiefly to widows, a most suitable field for the regular
   official exercise of their peculiar gifts of self-denying charity and
   devotion to the welfare of the church. Through it they could carry the
   light and comfort of the gospel into the most private and delicate
   relations of domestic life, without at all overstepping their natural
   sphere. Paul mentions Phoebe as a deaconess of the church of Cenchreae,
   the port of Corinth, and it is more than probable that Prisca
   (Priscilla), Mary, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis, whom he commends
   for their labor in the Lord, served in the same capacity at Rome. [734]

   The deaconesses were usually chosen from elderly widows. In the Eastern
   churches the office continued to the end of the twelfth century. [735]

   [729] diakonos, diaconus, in later usage also diakon, diacones (in
   Cyprian's works and in synodical decrees).

   Diaconatus ... in Ecclesiam Evangelicam ex Judaica. Erant enim in
   unaquaque Synagoga vysnrph g , tres Diaconi quibus incubuit ista cura
   (pauperum)."

   [731] According to a letter of Cornelius, the Roman Church in 251 had
   forty-six presbyters, but only seven deacons, Euseb., H. E., VI. 43.
   The places were filled by sub-deacons. In Constantinople, Justinian
   authorized the appointment of a hundred deacons.

   Ap. Ch., p. 536.

   [735] In the Roman Church, sisterhoods for charitable work have
   supplanted congregational deaconesses; and similar institutions
   (without the vow of celibacy) were established among the Moravians, in
   the Lutheran, Episcopal, and other churches. The Roman Catholic Sisters
   of Charity, and the Evangelical Deaconesses of Kaiserswerth are worthy
   of special honor. See art. Deacon, Deaconess, and Deaconesses in
   Schaff's Rel. Cyclop., vol. I. (1882), pp. 613 sqq.

   § 63. Church Discipline.

   Holiness, like unity and catholicity or universality, is an essential
   mark of the Church of Christ, who is himself the one, holy Saviour of
   all men; but it has never yet been perfectly actualized in her
   membership on earth, and is subject to gradual growth with many
   obstructions and lapses. The church militant, as a body, like every
   individual Christian, has to pass through a long process of
   sanctification, which cannot be complete till the second coming of the
   Lord.

   Even the apostles, far as they tower above ordinary Christians, and
   infallible as they are in giving all the instruction necessary to
   salvation, never during their earthly life claimed sinless perfection
   of character, but felt themselves oppressed with manifold infirmities,
   and in constant need of forgiveness and purification.

   Still less can we expect perfect moral purity in their churches. In
   fact, all the Epistles of the New Testament contain exhortations to
   progress in virtue and piety, warnings against unfaithfulness and
   apostasy, and reproofs respecting corrupt practices among the
   believers. The old leaven of Judaism and heathenism could not be purged
   away at once, and to many of the blackest sins the converts were for
   the first time fully exposed after their regeneration by water and the
   Spirit. In the churches of Galatia many fell back from grace and from
   the freedom of the gospel to the legal bondage of Judaism and the
   "rudiments of the world." In the church of Corinth, Paul had to rebuke
   the carnal spirit of sect, the morbid desire for wisdom, participation
   in the idolatrous feasts of the heathen, the tendency to uncleanness,
   and a scandalous profanation of the holy Supper or the love-feasts
   connected with it. Most of the churches of Asia Minor, according to the
   Epistles of Paul and the Apocalypse, were so infected with theoretical
   errors or practical abuses, as to call for the earnest warnings and
   reproofs of the Holy Spirit through the apostles. [736]

   These facts show how needful discipline is, both for the church herself
   and for the offenders. For the church it is a process of
   self-purification, and the assertion of the holiness and moral dignity
   which essentially belong to her. To the offender it is at once a
   merited punishment and a means of repentance and reform. For the
   ultimate end of the agency of Christ and his church is the salvation of
   souls; and Paul styles the severest form of church discipline the
   delivering of the backslider "to Satan for the destruction of the
   flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
   [737]

   The means of discipline are of various degrees of severity; first,
   private admonition, then public correction, and, finally, when these
   prove fruitless, excommunication, or temporary exclusion from all the
   means of grace and from Christian intercourse. [738] Upon sincere
   repentance, the fallen one is restored to the communion of the church.
   The act of discipline is that of the whole congregation in the name of
   Christ; and Paul himself, though personally absent, excommunicated the
   fornicator at Corinth with the concurrence of the congregation, and as
   being, in spirit united with it. In one of the only two passages where
   our Lord uses the term ecclesia, he speaks of it as a court which, like
   the Jewish synagogue, has authority to decide disputes and to exercise
   discipline. [739] In the synagogue, the college of presbyters formed
   the local court for judicial as well as administrative purposes, but
   acted in the name of the whole congregation.

   The two severest cases of discipline in the apostolic church were the
   fearful punishment of Ananias and Sapphira by Peter for falsehood and
   hypocrisy in the church of Jerusalem in the days of her first love,
   [740] and the excommunication of a member of the Corinthian
   congregation by Paul for adultery and incest. [741] The latter case
   affords also an instance of restoration. [742]

   § 64. The Council at Jerusalem.

   (Comp. § 34, pp. 835 sqq. and 346 sq.)

   The most complete outward representation of the apostolic church as a
   teaching and legislative body was the council convened at Jerusalem in
   the year 50, to decide as to the authority of the law of Moses, and
   adjust the difference between Jewish and Gentile Christianity. [743]

   We notice it here simply in its connection with the organization of the
   church.

   It consisted not of the apostles alone, but of apostles, elders, and
   brethren. We know that Peter, Paul, John, Barnabas, and Titus were
   present, perhaps all the other apostles. James--not one of the
   Twelve--presided as the local bishop, and proposed the compromise which
   was adopted. The transactions were public, before the congregation; the
   brethren took part in the deliberations; there was a sharp discussion,
   but the spirit of love prevailed over the pride of opinion; the
   apostles passed and framed the decree not without, but with the elders
   and with the whole church and sent the circular letter not in their own
   name only, but also in the name of "the brother elders" or "elder
   brethren" to "the brethren" of the congregations disturbed by the
   question of circumcision. [744]

   All of which plainly proves the right of Christian people to take part
   in some way in the government of the church, as they do in the acts of
   worship. The spirit and practice of the apostles favored a certain kind
   of popular self-government, and the harmonious, fraternal co-operation
   of the different elements of the church. It countenanced no abstract
   distinction of clergy and laity. All believers are called to the
   prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices in Christ. The bearers of
   authority and discipline should therefore never forget that their great
   work is to train the governed to freedom and independence, and by the
   various spiritual offices to build them up unto the unity of faith and
   knowledge, and to the perfect manhood of Christ.

   The Greek and Roman churches gradually departed from the apostolic
   polity and excluded not only the laity, but also the lower clergy from
   all participation in the legislative councils.

   The conference of Jerusalem, though not a binding precedent, is a
   significant example, giving the apostolic sanction to the synodical
   form of government, in which all classes of the Christian community are
   represented in the management of public affairs and in settling
   controversies respecting faith and discipline. The decree which it
   passed and the pastoral letter which it sent, are the first in the long
   line of decrees and canons and encyclicals which issued from
   ecclesiastical authorities. But it is significant that this first
   decree, though adopted undoubtedly under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, and wisely adapted to the times and circumstances of the mixed
   churches of Jewish and Gentile converts, was after all merely "a
   temporary expedient for a temporary emergency," and cannot be quoted as
   a precedent for infallible decrees of permanent force. The spirit of
   fraternal concession and harmony which dictated the Jerusalem
   compromise, is more important than the letter of the decree itself. The
   kingdom of Christ is not a dispensation of law, but of spirit and of
   life.

   Notes.

   I. There is an interesting difference of reading in Acts 15:23 (see the
   critical editions), but it does not affect the composition of the
   conference, at least as far as the elders are concerned. The textus
   receptus reads: hoi apostoloi, kai oi-i -ipresbuteroi, kai hoi
   adelphoi('', H, L, P, Syr., etc.), "The apostles, and the elders, and
   the brethren send greeting unto the brethren," etc. So the E. V.,
   except that it omits the article twice. The Revised V., following the
   better attested reading: hoi apostoloi, kai oi presbuteroi adelphoi,
   renders in the text: "The apostles, and the elders, brethren," and in
   the margin: "The apostles and the elder brethren" (omitting the comma).
   But it may also be translated: "The apostles, and brother-elders,"
   considering that Peter addresses the elders as sumpresbuteros,or
   "fellow-elder" (1 Pet. 5:1). The textus rec. agrees better with Acts
   15:22, and the omission of kai hoimay possibly have arisen from a
   desire to conform the text to the later practice which excluded the
   laity from synods, but it is strongly supported by 'Bellarmin and other
   Roman Catholic and certain Episcopal divines get over the fact of the
   participation of the elders and brethren in a legislative council by
   allowing the elders and brethren simply a silent consent. So Becker (as
   quoted by Bishop Jacobson, in Speaker's Commentary on Acts 15:22):,
   "The apostles join the elders and brethren with themselves ... not to
   allow them equal authority, but merely to express their concurrence."
   Very different is the view of Dr. Plumptre on Acts 15:22: "The latter
   words ['with the whole church'] are important as showing the position
   occupied by the laity. If they concurred in the latter, it must have
   been submitted to their approval, and the right to approve involves the
   power to reject and probably to modify." Bishop Cotterill (Genesis of
   the Church, p. 379) expresses the same view. "It was manifestly," he
   says, "a free council, and not a mere private meeting of some
   office-bearers. It was in fact much what the Agora was in archaic
   times, as described in Homer: in which the council of the nobles
   governed the decisions, but the people were present and freely
   expressed their opinion. And it must be remembered that the power of
   free speech in the councils of the church is the true test of the
   character of these assemblies. Free discussion, and arbitrary
   government, either by one person or by a privileged class, have been
   found, in all ages and under all polities, to be incompatible with each
   other. Again, not only were the multitude present, but we are expressly
   told that the whole church concurred in the decision and in the action
   taken upon it."

   II. The authority of the Jerusalem conference as a precedent for
   regular legislative councils and synods has been often overrated. On
   the other hand, Canon Farrar (Life and Work of St. Paul, I. 431)
   greatly underrates it when he says: "It is only by an unwarrantable
   extension of terms that the meeting of the church of Jerusalem can be
   called a 'council,' and the word connotes a totally different order of
   conceptions to those that were prevalent at that early time. The
   so-called Council of Jerusalem in no way resembled the General Councils
   of the Church, either in its history, its constitution, or its object.
   It was not a convention of ordained delegates, but a meeting of the
   entire church of Jerusalem to receive a deputation from the church of
   Antioch. Even Paul and Barnabas seem to have had no vote in the
   decision, though the votes of a promiscuous body could certainly not be
   more enlightened than theirs, nor was their allegiance due in any way
   to James. The church of Jerusalem might out of respect be consulted,
   but it had no claim to superiority, no abstract prerogative to bind its
   decisions on the free church of God. The 'decree' of the 'council' was
   little more than the wise recommendation of a single synod, addressed
   to a particular district, and possessing only a temporary validity. It
   was, in fact, a local concordat. Little or no attention has been paid
   by the universal church to two of its restrictions; a third, not many
   years after, was twice discussed and settled by Paul, on the same
   general principles, but with a by no means identical conclusion. The
   concession which it made to the Gentiles, in not insisting on the
   necessity of circumcision, was equally treated as a dead letter by the
   Judaizing party, and cost Paul the severest battle of his lifetime to
   maintain. If this circular letter is to be regarded as a binding and
   final decree, and if the meeting of a single church, not by delegates,
   but in the person of all its members, is to be regarded as a council,
   never was the decision of a council less appealed to, and never was a
   decree regarded as so entire inoperative alike by those who repudiated
   the validity of its concessions, and by those who discussed, as though
   they were still an open question, no less than three of its four
   restrictions."

   § 65. The Church and the Kingdom of Christ.

   Thus the apostolic church appears as a free, independent, and complete
   organism, a system of supernatural, divine life in a human body. It
   contains in itself all the offices and energies required for its
   purposes. It produces the supply of its outward wants from its own free
   spirit. It is a self-supporting and self-governing institution, within
   the state, but not of the state. Of a union with the state, either in
   the way of hierarchical supremacy or of Erastian subordination, the
   first three centuries afford no trace. The apostles honor the civil
   authority as a divine institution for the protection of life and
   property, for the reward of the good and the punishment of the
   evil-doer; and they enjoin, even under the reign of a Claudius and a
   Nero, strict obedience to it in all civil concerns; as, indeed, their
   heavenly Master himself submitted in temporal matters to Herod and to
   Pilate, and rendered unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's. But in
   their spiritual calling they allowed nothing to be prescribed or
   forbidden to them by the authorities of the state. Their principle was,
   to "obey God rather than men." For this principle, for their allegiance
   to the King of kings, they were always ready to suffer imprisonment,
   insult, persecution, and death, but never to resort to carnal weapons,
   or stir up rebellion and revolution. "The weapons of our warfare," says
   Paul, "are not carnal, but mighty through God." Martyrdom is a far
   nobler heroism than resistance with fire and sword, and leads with
   greater certainty at last to a thorough and permanent victory.

   The apostolic church, as to its membership, was not free from
   impurities, the after-workings of Judaism and heathenism and the
   natural man. But in virtue of an inherent authority it exercised rigid
   discipline, and thus steadily asserted its dignity and holiness. It was
   not perfect; but it earnestly strove after the perfection of manhood in
   Christ, and longed and hoped for the reappearance of the Lord in glory,
   to the exaltation of his people. It was as yet not actually universal,
   but a little flock compared with the hostile hosts of the heathen and
   Jewish world; yet it carried in itself the principle of true
   catholicity, the power and pledge of its victory over all other
   religions, and its final prevalence among all nations of the earth and
   in all classes of society.

   Paul defines the church as the body of Jesus Christ. [745] He thus
   represents it as an organic living system of various members, powers,
   and functions, and at the same time as the abode of Christ and the
   organ of his redeeming and sanctifying influence upon the world. Christ
   is, in one view, the ruling head, in another the all-pervading soul, of
   this body. Christ without the church were a head without a body, a
   fountain without a stream, a king without subjects, a captain without
   soldiers, a bridegroom without a bride. The church without Christ were
   a body without soul or spirit--a lifeless corpse. The church lives only
   as Christ lives and moves and works in her. At every moment of her
   existence she is dependent on him, as the body on the soul, or the
   branches on the vine. But on his part he perpetually bestows upon her
   his heavenly gifts and supernatural powers, continually reveals himself
   in her, and uses her as his organ for the spread of his kingdom and the
   christianizing of the world, till all principalities and powers shall
   yield free obedience to him, and adore him as the eternal Prophet,
   Priest, and King of the regenerate race. This work must be a gradual
   process of history. The idea of a body, and of all organic life,
   includes that of development, of expansion and consolidation. And hence
   the same Paul speaks also of the growth and edification of the body of
   Christ, "till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a full-grown man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ." [746]

   This sublime idea of the church, as developed in the First Epistle to
   the Corinthians, and especially in the Epistle to the Ephesians, when
   Paul was a prisoner chained to a heathen soldier, soars high above the
   actual condition of the little flocks of peasants, freedmen, slaves,
   and lowly, uncultured people that composed the apostolic congregations.
   It has no parallel in the social ideals of ancient philosophers and
   statesmen. It can only be traced to divine inspiration.

   We must not confound this lofty conception of the church as the body of
   Christ with any particular ecclesiastical organization, which at best
   is only a part of the whole, and an imperfect approach to the ideal.
   Nor must we identify it with the still higher idea of the kingdom of
   God or the kingdom of heaven. A vast amount of presumption, bigotry,
   and intolerance has grown out of such confusion. It is remarkable that
   Christ speaks only once of the church in the organic or universal
   sense. [747] But be very often speaks of the kingdom, and nearly all
   his parables illustrate this grand idea. The two conceptions are
   closely related, yet distinct. In many passages we could not possibly
   substitute the one for the other without manifest impropriety. [748]
   The church is external, visible, manifold, temporal; the kingdom of
   heaven is internal, spiritual, one, and everlasting. The kingdom is
   older and more comprehensive; it embraces all the true children of God
   on earth and in heaven, before Christ and after Christ, inside and
   outside of the churches and sects. The historical church with its
   various ramifications is a paedagogic institution or training-school
   for the kingdom of heaven, and will pass away as to its outward form
   when its mission is fulfilled. The kingdom has come in Christ, is
   continually coming, and will finally come in its full grown strength
   and beauty when the King will visibly appear in his glory.

   The coming of this kingdom in and through the visible churches, with
   varying conflicts and victories, is the proper object of church
   history. It is a slow, but sure and steady progress, with many
   obstructions, delays, circuitous turns and windings, but constant
   manifestations of the presence of him who sits at the helm of the ship
   and directs it through rain, storm, and sunshine to the harbor of the
   other and better world.

   buildings and of denominations (as the Roman Church, Anglican Church,
   Lutheran Church).

   inherit the church " (1 Cor. 6:10); "the church is not eating and
   drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom.
   15:17). On the other hand, it would be improper to call the kingdom of
   God "the body of Christ " or "the bride of the Lamb."

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 67. Unity of Apostolic Teaching.

   Christianity is primarily not merely doctrine, but life, a new moral
   creation, a saving fact, first personally embodied in Jesus Christ, the
   incarnate Word, the God-man, to spread from him and embrace gradually
   the whole body of the race, and bring it into saving fellowship with
   God. The same is true of Christianity as it exists subjectively in
   single individuals. It begins not with religious views and notions
   simply; though it includes these, at least in germ. It comes as a new
   life; as regeneration, conversion, and sanctification; as a creative
   fact in experience, taking up the whole man with all his faculties and
   capacities, releasing him from the guilt and the power of sin, and
   reconciling him with God, restoring harmony and peace to the soul, and
   at last glorifying the body itself. Thus, the life of Christ is
   mirrored in his people, rising gradually, through the use of the means
   of grace and the continued exercise of faith and love to its maturity
   in the resurrection.

   But the new life necessarily contains the element of doctrine, or
   knowledge of the truth. Christ calls himself "the way, the truth, and
   the life." He is himself the personal revelation of saving truth, and
   of the normal relation of man to God. Yet this element of doctrine
   itself appears in the New Testament, not in the form of an abstract
   theory, the product of speculation, a scientific system of ideas
   subject to logical and mathematical demonstration; but as the fresh,
   immediate utterance of the supernatural, divine life, a life-giving
   power, equally practical and theoretical, coming with divine authority
   to the heart, the will, and the conscience, as well as to the mind, and
   irresistibly drawing them to itself. The knowledge of God in Christ, as
   it meets us here, is at the same time eternal life. [749] We must not
   confound truth with dogma. Truth is the divine substance, doctrine or
   dogma is the human apprehension and statement of it; truth is a living
   and life-giving power, dogma a logical formula; truth is infinite,
   unchanging, and eternal; dogma is finite, changeable, and perfectible.

   The Bible, therefore, is not only, nor principally, a book for the
   learned, but a book of life for every one, an epistle written by the
   Holy Spirit to mankind. In the words of Christ and his apostles there
   breathes the highest and holiest spiritual power, the vivifying breath
   of God, piercing bone and marrow, thrilling through the heart and
   conscience, and quickening the dead. The life, the eternal life, which
   was from the beginning with the Father, and is manifested to us, there
   comes upon us, as it were, sensibly, now as the mighty tornado, now as
   the gentle zephyr; now overwhelming and casting us down in the dust of
   humility and penitence, now reviving and raising us to the joy of faith
   and peace; but always bringing forth a new creature, like the word of
   power, which said at the first creation. "Let there be light!" Here
   verily is holy ground. Here is the door of eternity, the true ladder to
   heaven, on which the angels of God are ascending and descending in
   unbroken line. No number of systems of Christian faith and morals,
   therefore, indispensable as they are to the scientific purposes of the
   church and of theology, can ever fill the place of the Bible, whose
   words are spirit and life.

   When we say the New Testament is no logically arranged system of
   doctrines and precepts, we are far from meaning that it has no internal
   order and consistency. On the contrary, it exhibits the most beautiful
   harmony, like the external creation, and like a true work of art. It is
   the very task of the historian, and especially of the theologian, to
   bring this hidden living order to view, and present it in logical and
   scientific forms. For this work Paul, the only one of the apostles who
   received a learned education, himself furnishes the first fruitful
   suggestions, especially in his epistle to the Romans. This epistle
   follows a logical arrangement even in form, and approaches as nearly to
   a scientific treatise as it could consistently with the fervent,
   direct, practical, popular spirit and style essential to the Holy
   Scriptures and inseparable from their great mission for all
   Christendom.

   The substance of all the apostolic teaching is the witness of Christ,
   the gospel, and the free message of that divine love and salvation,
   which appeared in the person of Christ, was secured to mankind by his
   work, is gradually realized in the kingdom of God on earth, and will be
   completed with the second coming of Christ in glory. This salvation
   also comes in close connection with Judaism, as the fulfilment of the
   law and the prophets, the substance of all the Old Testament types and
   shadows. The several doctrines entering essentially into this apostolic
   preaching are most beautifully and simply arranged and presented in
   what is called the Apostles' Creed, which, though not in its precise
   form, yet, as regards its matter, certainly dates from the primitive
   age of Christianity. On all the leading points, the person of Jesus as
   the promised Messiah, his holy life, his atoning death, his triumphant
   resurrection and exaltation at the right hand of God, and his second
   coming to judge the world, the establishment of the church as a divine
   institution, the communion of believers, the word of God, and the
   sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper, the work of the Holy
   Spirit, the necessity of repentance and conversion, of regeneration and
   sanctification, the final completion of salvation in the day of Jesus
   Christ, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting--on all
   these points the apostles are perfectly unanimous, so far as their
   writings have come down to us.

   The apostles all drew their doctrine in common from personal contact
   with the divine-human history of the crucified and risen Saviour, and
   from the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit, revealing the person
   and the work of Christ in them, and opening to them the understanding
   of his words and acts. This divine enlightenment is inspiration,
   governing not only the composition of the sacred writings, but also the
   oral instructions of their authors; not merely an act, but a permanent
   state. The apostles lived and moved continually in the element of
   truth. They spoke, wrote, and acted from the spirit of truth; and this,
   not as passive instruments, but as conscious and free organs. For the
   Holy Spirit does not supersede the gifts and peculiarities of nature,
   which are ordained by God; it sanctifies them to the service of his
   kingdom. Inspiration, however, is concerned only with moral and
   religious truths, and the communication of what is necessary to
   salvation. Incidental matters of geography, history, archeology, and of
   mere personal interest, can be regarded as directed by inspiration only
   so far as they really affect religious truth.

   The revelation of the body of Christian truth essential to salvation
   coincides in extent with the received canon of the New Testament. There
   is indeed constant growth and development in the Christian church,
   which progresses outwardly and inwardly in proportion to the degree of
   its vitality and zeal, but it is a progress of apprehension and
   appropriation by man, not of communication or revelation by God. We may
   speak of a secondary inspiration of extraordinary men whom God raises
   from time to time, but their writings must be measured by the only
   infallible standard, the teaching of Christ and his apostles. Every
   true advance in Christian knowledge and life is conditioned by a deeper
   descent into the mind and spirit of Christ, who declared the whole
   counsel of God and the way of salvation, first in person, and then
   through his apostles.

   The New Testament is thus but one book, the teaching of one mind, the
   mind of Christ. He gave to his disciples the words of life which the
   Father gave him, and inspired them with the spirit of truth to reveal
   his glory to them. Herein consists the unity and harmony of the
   twenty-seven writings which constitute the New Testament, for all
   emergencies and for perpetual use, until the written and printed word
   shall be superseded by the reappearance of the personal Word, and the
   beatific vision of saints in light.

   § 68. Different Types of Apostolic Teaching.

   With all this harmony, the Christian doctrine appears in the New
   Testament in different forms according to the peculiar character,
   education, and sphere of the several sacred writers. The truth of the
   gospel, in itself infinite, can adapt itself to every class, to every
   temperament, every order of talent, and every habit of thought. Like
   the light of the sun, it breaks into various colors according to the
   nature of the bodies on which it falls; like the jewel, it emits a new
   radiance at every turn.

   Irenaeus speaks of a fourfold "Gospel." [750] In like manner we may
   distinguish a fourfold "Apostle," [751] or four corresponding types of
   apostolic doctrine. [752] The Epistle of James corresponds to the
   Gospel of Matthew; the Epistles of Peter and his addresses in the Acts
   to that of Mark; the Epistles of Paul to the Gospel of Luke and his
   Acts; and the Epistles of John to the Gospel of the same apostle.

   This division, however, both as regards the Gospels and the Epistles,
   is subordinate to a broader difference between Jewish and Gentile
   Christianity, which runs through the entire history of the apostolic
   period and affects even the doctrine, the polity, the worship, and the
   practical life of the church. The difference rests on the great
   religious division of the world, before and at the time of Christ, and
   continued until a native Christian race took the place of the first
   generation of converts. The Jews naturally took the Christian faith
   into intimate association with the divinely revealed religion of the
   old covenant, and adhered as far as possible to their sacred
   institutions and rites; while the heathen converts, not having known
   the law of Moses, passed at once from the state of nature to the state
   of grace. The former represented the historical, traditional,
   conservative principle; the latter, the principle of freedom,
   independence, and progress.

   Accordingly we have two classes of teachers: apostles of the Jews or of
   the circumcision, and apostles of the Gentiles or of the
   uncircumcision. That this distinction extends farther than the mere
   missionary field, and enters into all the doctrinal views and practical
   life of the parties, we see from the accounts of the apostolic council
   which was held for the express purpose of adjusting the difference
   respecting the authority of the Mosaic law.

   But the opposition was only relative, though it caused collisions at
   times, and even temporary alienation, as between Paul and Peter at
   Antioch. [753] As the two forms of Christianity had a common root in
   the full life of Christ, the Saviour of both Gentiles and Jews, so they
   gradually grew together into the unity of the catholic church. And as
   Peter represents the Jewish church, and Paul the Gentile, so John, at
   the close of the apostolic age, embodies the higher union of the two.

   With this difference of standpoint are connected subordinate
   differences, as of temperament, style, method. James has been
   distinguished as the apostle of the law or of works; Peter, as the
   apostle of hope; Paul, as the apostle of faith; and John, as the
   apostle of love. To the first has been assigned the phlegmatic (?)
   temperament, in its sanctified Christian state, to the second the
   sanguine, to the third the choleric, and to the fourth the melancholic;
   a distribution, however, only admissible in a very limited sense. The
   four gospels also present similar differences; the first having close
   affinity to the position of James, the second to that of Peter, the
   third to that of Paul, and the fourth representing in its doctrinal
   element the spirit of John.

   If we make the difference between Jewish and Gentile Christianity the
   basis of classification, we may reduce the books of the New Testament
   to three types of doctrine: the Jewish Christian, the Gentile
   Christian, and the ideal or unionistic Christian. The first is chiefly
   represented by Peter, the second by Paul, the third by John. As to
   James, he must be ranked under the first type as the local head of the
   Jerusalem wing of the conservative school, while Peter war, the
   oecumenical head of the whole church of the circumcision. [754]

   for James as the representative of the Greek church, in distinction
   from the Roman or Petrine church. I mention this as an interesting
   modification of his theory, not made known before, and as containing a
   grain of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 69. The Jewish Christian Theology--I. James and the Gospel of Law.

   (Comp. § 27, and the Lit. given there.)

   The Jewish Christian type embraces the Epistles of James, Peter, and
   Jude, the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and to some extent the
   Revelation of John; for John is placed by Paul among the "pillars" of
   the church of the circumcision, though in his later writings he took an
   independent position above the distinction of Jew and Gentile. In these
   books, originally designed mainly, though not exclusively, for Jewish
   Christian readers, Christianity is exhibited in its unity with the Old
   Testament, as the fulfilment of the same. They unfold the fundamental
   idea of the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:17), that Christ did not come
   to destroy the law or the prophets, but to "fulfil." The Gospels,
   especially that of Matthew, show historically that Jesus is the
   Messiah, the lawgiver, the prophet, priest, and king of Israel.

   On this historical basis James and Peter build their practical
   exhortations, with this difference, that the former shows chiefly the
   agreement of the gospel with the law, the latter with the prophets.

   James, the brother of the Lord, in keeping with his life-long labors in
   Jerusalem, his speech at the Council, and the letter of the
   Council--which he probably wrote himself--holds most closely to the
   Mosaic religion, and represents the gospel itself as law, yet as the
   "perfect law of liberty." [755] Herein lies the difference as well as
   the unity of the two dispensations. The "law" points to the harmony,
   the qualifying "perfect" and "liberty" to the superiority of
   Christianity, and intimates that Judaism was imperfect and a law of
   bondage, from which Christ has set us free. Paul, on the contrary,
   distinguishes the gospel as freedom from the law, as a system of
   slavery; [756] but he re-establishes the law on the basis of freedom,
   and sums up the whole Christian life in the fulfilment of the law of
   love to God and to our neighbor; therein meeting James from the
   opposite starting-point. [757]

   James, the Christian legalist, lays great stress on good works which
   the law requires, but he demands works which are the fruit of faith in
   Him, whom he, as his servant, reverently calls "the Lord of glory," and
   whose words as reported by Matthew are the basis of his exhortations.
   [758] Such faith, moreover, is the result of it new birth, which he
   traces to "the will of God" through the agency of "the word of truth,"
   that is, the gospel. [759] As to the relation between faith and works
   and their connection with justification at the tribunal of God, he
   seems to teach the doctrine of justification by faith and works; while
   Paul teaches the doctrine of justification by faith alone, to be
   followed by good works, as the necessary evidence of faith. The two
   views as thus stated are embodied in the Roman Catholic and the
   evangelical Protestant confessions, and form one of the chief topics of
   controversy. But the contradiction between James and Paul is verbal
   rather than logical and doctrinal, and admits of a reconciliation which
   lies in the inseparable connection of a living faith and good works, or
   of justification and sanctification, so that they supplement and
   confirm each other, the one laying the true foundation in character,
   the other insisting on the practical manifestation. James wrote
   probably long before he had seen any of Paul's Epistles, certainly with
   no view to refute his doctrine or even to guard it against antinomian
   abuse; for this was quite unnecessary, as Paul did it clearly enough
   himself, and it would have been quite useless for Jewish Christian
   readers who were exposed to the danger of a barren legalism, but not of
   a pseudo-Pauline liberalism and antinomianism. They cannot, indeed, be
   made to say precisely the same thing, only using one or more of the
   three terms, "to justify," "faith," "works" in different senses; but
   they wrote from different standpoints and opposed different errors, and
   thus presented two distinct aspects of the same truth. James says:
   Faith is dead without works. Paul says: Works are dead without faith.
   The one insists on a working faith, the other on faithful works. Both
   are right: James in opposition to the dead Jewish orthodoxy, Paul in
   opposition to self-righteous legalism. James does not demand works
   without faith, but works prompted by faith; [760] While Paul, on the
   other hand, likewise declares a faith worthless which is without love,
   though it remove mountains, [761] and would never have attributed a
   justifying power to the mere belief in the existence of God, which
   James calls the trembling faith of demons. [762] But James mainly looks
   at the fruit, Paul at the root; the one is concerned for the evidence,
   the other for the principle; the one takes the practical and
   experimental view, and reasons from the effect to the cause, the other
   goes deeper to the inmost springs of action, but comes to the same
   result: a holy life of love and obedience as the necessary evidence of
   true faith. And this, after all, is the ultimate standard of judgment
   according to Paul as well as James. [763] Paul puts the solution of the
   difficulty in one sentence: "faith working through love." This is the
   Irenicon of contending apostles and contending churches. [764]

   The Epistle of James stands at the head of the Catholic Epistles, so
   called, and represents the first and lowest stage of Christian
   knowledge. It is doctrinally very meagre, but eminently practical and
   popular. It enjoins a simple, earnest, and devout style of piety that
   visits the orphans and widows, and keeps itself unspotted from the
   world. [765]

   The close connection between the Epistle of James and the Gospel of
   Matthew arises naturally from their common Jewish Christian and
   Palestinian origin.

   Notes

   I. James and Paul.. The apparent contradiction in the doctrine of
   justification appears in James 2:14-26, as compared with Rom. 3:20
   sqq.; 4:1 sqq.; Gal. 2:16 sqq. Paul says (Rom. 3:28): "Man is justified
   by faith apart from works of law" (pistei choris ergon nomou), comp.
   Gal. 2:16 (ou dikaioutai anthropos ez ergon nomou ean me dia pisteos
   Christou Iesou), and appeals to the example of Abraham, who was
   justified by faith before he was circumcised (Gen. 17:10). James 2:24
   says: "By works a man is justified, and not only by faith" (ex ergon
   dikaioutai, anthropos kai ouk ek pisteos monon), and appeals to the
   example of the same Abraham who showed his true faith in God by
   offering up his son Isaac upon the altar (Gen. 22:9, 12). Luther makes
   the contradiction worse by unnecessarily inserting the word allein(sola
   fide) in Rom. 3:28, though not without precedent (see my note on the
   passage in the Am. ed. of Lange on Romans, p. 136). The great Reformer
   could not reconcile the two apostles, and rashly called the Epistle of
   James an "epistle of straw" (eine recht ströherne Epistel, Pref. to the
   New Test., 1524).

   Baur, from a purely critical point of view, comes to the same
   conclusion; he regards the Epistle of James as a direct attack upon the
   very heart of the doctrine of Paul, and treats all attempts at
   reconciliation as vain. (Vorles. über neutestam. Theol., p. 277). So
   also Renan and Weiffenbach. Renan (St. Paul, ch. 10) asserts without
   proof that James organized a Jewish counter-mission to undermine Paul.
   But in this case, James, as a sensible and practical man, ought to have
   written to Gentile Christians, not to "the twelve tribes," who needed
   no warning against Paul and his doctrine. His Epistle represents simply
   an earlier and lower form of Christianity ignorant of the higher, yet
   preparatory to it, as the preaching of John the Baptist prepared the
   way for that of Christ. It was written without any reference to Paul,
   probably before the Council of Jerusalem and before the circumcision
   controversy, in the earliest stage of the apostolic church as it is
   described in the first chapters of the Acts, when the Christians were
   not yet clearly distinguished and finally separated from the Jews. This
   view of the early origin of the Epistle is maintained by some of the
   ablest historians and commentators, as Neander, Schneckenburger,
   Theile, Thiersch, Beyschlag, Alford, Basset, Plumptre, Stanley. Weiss
   also says very confidently (Bibl. Theol. 3d ed., p. 120): "Der Brief
   gehört der vorpaulinischen Zeit an und steht jedenfalls zeitlich wie
   inhaltlich dem ersten Brief Petri am nächsten." He therefore treats
   both James and Peter on their own merits, without regard to Paul's
   teaching. Comp. his Einleitung in d. N. T. (1886), p. 400.

   II. James and Matthew. The correspondence has often been fully pointed
   out by Theile and other commentators. James contains more reminiscences
   of the words of Christ than any other Epistle, especially from the
   Sermon on the Mount. Comp. James 1:2 with Matt. 5:10-12; James 1:4 with
   Matt. 5:48; James 1:17 with Matt. 7:11; James 1:20 with Matt. 5:22;
   James 1:22 sqq. with Matt. 7:21 sq.; James 1:23 with Matt. 7:26; James
   2:13 with Matt. 6:14 sq.; James 2:14 with Matt. 7:21-23; James 3:2 with
   Matt. 12:36, 37; James 3:17, 18 with Matt. 5:9; James 4:3 with Matt.
   7:7; James 4:4 with Matt. 6:24; James 5:12 with Matt. 5:34. According
   to a notice in the pseudo-Athanasian Synopsis, James "the Bishop of
   Jerusalem" translated the Gospel of Matthew from the Aramaic into the
   Greek. But there are also parallelisms between James and the first
   Epistle of Peter, and even between James and the apocryphal books of
   Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon. See Plumptre, Com. on James,
   pp. 32 sq.

   apparent contradiction between the doctrines of justification by faith
   and judgment by works lies in the character of the works as being the
   evidence of faith.

   [764] Gal. 5:6: pistis di agapes energoumene, is operative (in the
   middle sense, as always in the New Test.). "These words," says Bishop
   Lightfoot (in loc.),"bridge the gulf which seems to separate the
   language of St. Paul and St. James. Both assert a principle of
   practical energy, as opposed to a barren in active theory." To quote
   from my own commentary on the passage (1882): "The sentence 'faith
   working through love' reconciles the doctrine of Paul with that of
   James; comp. 6:15; 1 Thess. 1:3; 1 Cor. 13; 1 Tim. 1:5; James 2:22.
   Here is the basis for a final settlement of the controversy on the
   doctrine of justification. Romanism (following exclusively the language
   of James) teaches justification by faith and works; Protestantism (on
   the authority of Paul), justification by faith alone; Paul and James
   combined: justification and salvation by faith working through love.
   Man is justified by faith alone, but faith remains not alone: it is the
   fruitful mother of good works, which are summed up in love to God and
   love to men. Faith and love are as inseparable as light and heat in the
   sun. Christ's merits are the objective and meritorious ground of
   justification; faith (as the organ of appropriation) is the subjective
   condition; love or good works are the necessary evidence; without love
   faith is dead, according to James, or no faith at all, according to
   Paul. A great deal of misunderstanding in this and other theological
   controversies has arisen from the different use of terms."

   § 70. II. Peter and the Gospel of Hope.

   (Comp. the Lit. in §§ 25 and 26.)

   Peter stands between James and Paul, and forms the transition from the
   extreme conservatism of the one to the progressive liberalism of the
   other. The germ of his doctrinal system is contained in his great
   confession that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of the living God. [766]
   A short creed indeed, with only one article, but a fundamental and
   all-comprehensive article, the corner-stone of the Christian church.
   His system, therefore, is Christological, and supplements the
   anthropological type of James. His addresses in the Acts and his
   Epistles are full of the fresh impressions which the personal
   intercourse with Christ made upon his noble, enthusiastic, and
   impulsive nature. Christianity is the fulfilment of all the Messianic
   prophecies; but it is at the same time itself a prophecy of the
   glorious return of the Lord. This future glorious manifestation is so
   certain that it is already anticipated here in blessed joy by a lively
   hope which stimulates to a holy life of preparation for the end. Hence,
   Peter eminently deserves to be called "the Apostle of hope." [767]

   I. Peter began his testimony with the announcement of the historical
   facts of the resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit, and represents these facts as the divine seal of his
   Messiahship, according to the prophets of old, who bear witness to him
   that through his name every one that believes shall receive remission
   of sins. The same Jesus whom God raised from the dead and exalted to
   his right hand as Lord and Saviour, will come again to judge his people
   and to bring in seasons of refreshing from his presence and the
   apokatastasis or restitution of all things to their normal and perfect
   state, thus completely fulfilling the Messianic prophecies. There is no
   salvation out of the Lord Jesus Christ. The condition of this salvation
   is the acknowledgment of his Messiahship and the change of mind and
   conduct from the service of sin to holiness. [768]

   These views are so simple, primitive, and appropriate that we cannot
   conceive how Peter could have preached differently and more effectively
   in that early stage of Christianity. We need not wonder at the
   conversion of three thousand souls in consequence of his, pentecostal
   sermon. His knowledge gradually widened and deepened with the expansion
   of Christianity and the conversion of Cornelius. A special revelation
   enlightened him on the question of circumcision and brought him to the
   conviction that "in every nation he that fears God and works
   righteousness, is acceptable to him," and that Jews and Gentiles are
   saved alike by the grace of Christ through faith, without the
   unbearable yoke of the ceremonial law. [769]

   II. The Epistles of Peter represent this riper stage of knowledge. They
   agree substantially with the teaching of Paul. The leading idea is the
   same as that presented in his addresses in the Acts: Christ the
   fulfiller of the Messianic prophecies, and the hope of the Christian.
   Peter's christology is free of all speculative elements, and simply
   derived from the impression of the historical and risen Jesus. He
   emphasizes in the first Epistle, as in his earlier addresses, the
   resurrection whereby God "begat us again unto a lively hope, unto an
   inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
   reserved in heaven," when "the chief shepherd shall be manifested," and
   we "shall receive the crown of glory." And in the second Epistle he
   points forward to "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness." [770] He thus connects the resurrection of Christ with
   the final consummation of which it is the sure pledge. But, besides the
   resurrection, he brings out also the atoning efficacy of the death of
   Christ almost as strongly and clearly as Paul. Christ "suffered for
   sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to
   God;" he himself "bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we,
   having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness;" he redeemed us
   "with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
   [771] Christ is to him the only Saviour, the Lord, the Prince of life,
   the Judge of the world. He assigns him a majestic position far above
   all other men, and brings him into the closest contact with the eternal
   Jehovah, though in subordination to him. The doctrine of the
   pre-existence seems to be intimated and implied, if not expressly
   stated, when Christ is spoken of as being "foreknown before the
   foundation of the world" and "manifested at the end of the time," and
   his Spirit as dwelling in the prophets of old and pointing them to his
   future sufferings and glory. [772]

   III. Peter extends the preaching, judging, and saving activity of
   Christ to the realm of the departed spirits in Hades during the
   mysterious triduum between the crucifixion and the resurrection. [773]
   The descent into Hades is also taught by Paul (Eph. 4:9, 10).

   IV. With this theory correspond the practical exhortations. Subjective
   Christianity is represented as faith in the historical Christ and as a
   lively hope in his, glorious reappearance, which should make the
   Christians rejoice even amidst trials and persecution, after the
   example of their Lord and Saviour.

   foreknowledge of God, and emphasizes the epoiesen in Acts 2:36. He
   refers the p'euma Christouto the Holy Spirit, which was afterwards
   given in full measure to Christ at his baptism. So also Weiss (p. 161).
   But in this case Peter would have said to peuma hagion, as he did 1
   Pet. 1:12; 2 Pet. 1:21; Acts 2:33, 38.

   [773] 1 Pet. 3:19; 4:6; comp. Acts 2:27. The reference of the first
   passage to a preaching of Christ through Noah at the time of the flood
   is artificial, breaks the historic connection (apethanen ...
   thamatotheis ... zoopoietheis pneumati ... ekeruxen -i... -iporeutheis
   eis ouranon ) and is set aside by 1 Pet. 4:6, which explains and
   generalizes the statement of the former passage. Baur (p. 291)
   understands the pneumata en phulake to be the fallen angels (comp. 2
   Pet. 2:4; Gen. 6:1), and the preaching of Christ an announcement of the
   judgment. But in this case we should have to distinguish between the
   ekeruxen, 1 Pet. 3:9, and the euengelisthe in 4:6. The latter always
   means preaching the gospel, which is a savor of life unto life to
   believers, and a savor of death unto death to unbelievers.

   § 71. The Gentile Christian Theology. Paul and the Gospel of Faith.

   (See the Lit. in § 29, pp. 280 sqq.)

   The Gentile Christian type of the gospel is embodied in the writings of
   Paul and Luke, and in the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews.

   The sources of Paul's theology are his discourses in the Acts
   (especially the speech on the Areopagus) and his thirteen Epistles,
   namely, the Epistles to the Thessalonians--the earliest, but chiefly
   practical; the four great Epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians, and
   Romans, which are the mature result of his conflict with the Judaizing
   tendency; the four Epistles of the captivity; and the Pastoral
   Epistles. These groups present as many phases of development of his
   system and discuss different questions with appropriate variations of
   style, but they are animated by the same spirit, and bear the marks of
   the same profound and comprehensive genius.

   Paul is the pioneer of Christian theology. He alone among the apostles
   had received a learned rabbinical education and was skilled in logical
   and dialectical argument. But his logic is vitalized and set on fire.
   His theology springs from his heart as well as from his brain; it is
   the result of his conversion, and all aglow with the love of Christ;
   his scholasticism is warmed and deepened by mysticism, and his
   mysticism is regulated and sobered by scholasticism; the religious and
   moral elements, dogmatics, and ethics, are blended into a harmonious
   whole. Out of the depths of his personal experience, and in conflict
   with the Judaizing contraction and the Gnostic evaporation of the
   gospel be elaborated the fullest scheme of Christian doctrine which we
   possess from apostolic pens. It is essentially soteriological, or a
   system of the way of salvation. It goes far beyond the teaching of
   James and Peter, and yet is only a consistent development of the
   teaching of Jesus in the Gospels. [774]

   The Central Idea.

   Paul's personal experience embraced intense fanaticism for Judaism, and
   a more intense enthusiasm for Christianity. It was first an unavailing
   struggle of legalism towards human righteousness by works of the law,
   and then the apprehension of divine righteousness by faith in Christ.
   This dualism is reflected in his theology. The idea of righteousness or
   conformity to God's holy will is the connecting link between the Jewish
   Saul and the Christian Paul. Law and works, was the motto of the
   self-righteous pupil of Moses; gospel and faith, the motto of the
   humble disciple of Jesus. He is the emancipator of the Christian
   consciousness from the oppressive bondage of legalism and bigotry, and
   the champion of freedom and catholicity. Paul's gospel is emphatically
   the gospel of saving faith, the gospel of evangelical freedom, the
   gospel of universalism, centring in the person and work of Christ and
   conditioned by union with Christ. He determined to know nothing but
   Christ and him crucified; but this included all--it is the soul of his
   theology. The Christ who died is the Christ who was raised again and
   ever lives as Lord and Saviour, and was made unto us wisdom from God,
   and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. [775] A dead
   Christ would be the grave of all our hopes, and the gospel of a dead
   Saviour a wretched delusion. "If Christ has not been raised then is our
   preaching vain, your faith also is vain." [776] His death becomes
   available only through his resurrection. Paul puts the two facts
   together in the comprehensive statement: "Christ delivered up for our
   trespasses, and raised for our justification." [777] He is a
   conditional universalist; he teaches the universal need of salvation,
   and the divine intention and provision for a universal salvation, but
   the actual salvation of each man depends upon his faith or personal
   acceptance and appropriation of Christ. His doctrinal system, then,
   turns on the great antithesis of sin and grace. Before Christ and out
   of Christ is the reign of sin and death; after Christ and in Christ is
   the reign of righteousness and life.

   We now proceed to an outline of the leading features of his theology as
   set forth in the order of the Epistle to the Romans, the most
   methodical and complete of his writings. Its central thought is: The
   Gospel of Christ, a power of God for the salvation of all men, Jew and
   Gentile. [778]

   1. The Universal Need of Salvation.--It arises from the fall of Adam
   and the whole human race, which was included in him as the tree is
   included in the seed, so that his one act of disobedience brought sin
   and death upon the whole posterity. Paul proves the depravity of
   Gentiles and Jews without exception to the extent that they are
   absolutely unable to attain to righteousness and to save themselves.
   "There is none righteous, no, not one." They are all under the dominion
   of sin and under the sentence of condemnation. [779] He recognizes
   indeed, even among the heathen, the remaining good elements of reason
   and conscience, [780] which are the connecting links for the
   regenerating work of divine grace; but for this very reason they are
   inexcusable, as they sin against better knowledge. There is a conflict
   between the higher and the lower nature in man (the nous, which tends
   to God who gave it, and the sarx, which tends to sin), and this
   conflict is stimulated and brought to a crisis by the law of God; but
   this conflict, owing to the weakness of our carnal, fallen, depraved
   nature, ends in defeat and despair till the renewing grace of Christ
   emancipates us from the curse and bondage of sin and gives us liberty
   and victory. In the seventh chapter of the Romans, Paul gives from his
   personal experience a most remarkable and truthful description of the
   religious history of man from the natural or heathen state of carnal
   security (without the law, Rom. 7:7-9) to the Jewish state under the
   law which calls out sin from its hidden recess, reveals its true
   character, and awakens the sense of the wretchedness of slavery under
   sin (7:10-25), but in this very way prepares the way for the Christian
   state of freedom (7:24 and Rom. 8). [781]

   II. The Divine Intention and Provision of Universal Salvation.--God
   sincerely wills (thelei) that all men, even the greatest of sinners,
   should be saved, and come to the knowledge of truth through Christ, who
   gave himself a ransom for all. [782] The extent of Christ's
   righteousness and life is as universal as the extent of Adam's sin and
   death, and its intensive power is even greater. The first and the
   second Adam are perfectly parallel by contrast in their representative
   character, but Christ is much stronger and remains victor of the field,
   having slain sin and death, and living for ever as the prince of life.
   Where sin abounds there grace super-abounds. As through the first Adam
   sin (as a pervading force) entered into the world, and death through
   sin, and thus death passed unto all men, inasmuch as they all sinned
   (in Adam generically and potentially, and by actual transgression
   individually); so much more through Christ, the second Adam,
   righteousness entered into the world and life through righteousness,
   and thus righteousness passed unto all men on condition of faith by
   which we partake of his righteousness. [783] God shut up all men in
   disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all that believe. [784]

   (1.) The Preparation for this salvation was the promise and the law of
   the Old dispensation. The promise given to Abraham and the patriarchs
   is prior to the law, and not set aside by the law; it contained the
   germ and the pledge of salvation, and Abraham stands out as the father
   of the faithful, who was justified by faith even before he received
   circumcision as a sign and seal. The law came in besides, or between
   the promise and the gospel in order to develop the disease of sin, to
   reveal its true character as a transgression of the divine will, and
   thus to excite the sense of the need of salvation. The law is in itself
   holy and good, but cannot give life; it commands and threatens, but
   gives no power to fulfil; it cannot renew the flesh, that is, the
   depraved, sinful nature of man; it can neither justify nor sanctify,
   but it brings the knowledge of sin, and by its discipline it prepares
   men for the freedom of Christ, as a schoolmaster prepares children for
   independent manhood. [785]

   (2.) The Salvation itself is comprehended in the person and work of
   Christ. It was accomplished in the fulness of the time by the sinless
   life, the atoning death, and the glorious resurrection and exaltation
   of Christ, the eternal Son of God, who appeared in the likeness of the
   flesh of sin and as an offering for sin, and thus procured for us
   pardon, peace, and reconciliation. "God spared not his own Son, but
   delivered him up for us all." This is the greatest gift of the eternal
   love of the Father for his creatures. The Son of God, prompted by the
   same infinite love, laid aside his divine glory and mode of existence,
   emptied himself exchanged the form of God for the form of a servant,
   humbled himself and became obedient, even unto the death of the cross.
   Though he was rich, being equal with God, yet for our sakes he became
   poor, that we through his poverty might become rich. In reward for his
   active and passive obedience God exalted him and gave him a name above
   every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every
   tongue confess that he is Lord. [786]

   Formerly the cross of Christ had been to the carnal Messianic
   expectations and self-righteousness of Paul, as well as of other Jews,
   the greatest stumbling-block, as it was the height of folly to the
   worldly wisdom of the heathen mind. [787] But the heavenly vision of
   the glory of Jesus at Damascus unlocked the key for the understanding
   of this mystery, and it was confirmed by the primitive apostolic
   tradition, [788] and by his personal experience of the failure of the
   law and the power of the gospel to give peace to his troubled
   conscience. The death of Christ appeared to him now as the divinely
   appointed means for procuring righteousness. It is the device of
   infinite wisdom and love to reconcile the conflicting claims of justice
   and mercy whereby God could justify the sinner and yet remain just
   himself. [789] Christ, who knew no sin, became sin for us that we might
   become righteousness of God in him. He died in the place and for the
   benefit (huper, peri) of sinners and enemies, so that his death has a
   universal significance. If one died for all, they all died. [790] He
   offered his spotless and holy life as a ransom (lutron) or price (time)
   for our sins, and thus effected our redemption (apolutrosis), as
   prisoners of war are redeemed by the payment of an equivalent. His
   death, therefore, is a vicarious sacrifice, an atonement, an expiation
   or propitiation hilasmos, hilasterion, sacrificium expiatorium) for the
   sins of the whole world, and secured full and final remission (aphesis)
   and reconciliation between God and man (katallage). This the Mosaic law
   and sacrifices could not accomplish. They could only keep alive and
   deepen the sense of the necessity of an atonement. If righteousness
   came by the law, Christ's death would be needless and fruitless. His
   death removes not only the guilt of sin, but it destroyed also its
   power and dominion. Hence the great stress Paul laid on the preaching
   of the cross (ho logos tou staurou) in which alone he would glory.
   [791]

   This rich doctrine of the atonement which pervades the Pauline Epistles
   is only a legitimate expansion of the word of Christ that he would give
   his life as a ransom for sinners and shed his blood for the remission
   of sins.

   (3.) While Christ accomplished the salvation, the Holy Spirit
   appropriates it to the believer. The Spirit is the religious and moral
   principle of the new life. Emanating from God, he dwells in the
   Christian as a renewing, sanctifying, comforting energy, as the higher
   conscience, as a divine guide and monitor. He mediates between Christ
   and the church as Christ mediates between God and the world; be is the
   divine revealer of Christ to the individual consciousness and the
   source of all graces (charismata) through which the new life manifests
   itself. "Christ in us" is equivalent to having the "Spirit of Christ."
   It is only by the inward revelation of the Spirit that we can call
   Christ our Lord and Saviour, and God our Father; by the Spirit the love
   of God is shed abroad in our hearts; the Spirit works in us faith and
   all virtues; it is the Spirit who transforms even the body of the
   believer into a holy temple; those who are led by the Spirit are the
   sons of God and heirs of salvation; it is by the law of the Spirit of
   life in Christ Jesus that we are made free from the law of sin and
   death and are able to walk in newness of life. Where the Spirit of God
   is there is true liberty. [792]

   (4.) There is, then, a threefold cause of our salvation: the Father who
   sends his Son, the Son who procures salvation, and the Holy Spirit who
   applies it to the believer. This threefold agency is set forth in the
   benediction, which comprehends all divine blessings: "the grace
   (charis) of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the (agape) of God, and the
   communion (koinonia) of the Holy Spirit." [793] This is Paul's
   practical view of the Holy Trinity as revealed in the gospel. The grace
   of Christ is mentioned first because in it is exhibited to us the love
   of the Father in its highest aspect as a saving power; to the Holy
   Spirit is ascribed the communion because he is the bond of union
   between the Father and the Son, between Christ and the believer, and
   between the believers as members of one brotherhood of the redeemed.

   To this divine trinity corresponds, we may say, the human trinity of
   Christian graces: faith, hope, love. [794]

   III. The Order of Salvation.--(1.) Salvation has its roots in the
   eternal counsel of God, his Foreknowledge (prognosis), and his
   Foreordination (proorismos, prothesis); the former an act of his
   omniscient intellect, the latter of his omnipotent will. Logically,
   foreknowledge precedes foreordination, but in reality both coincide and
   are simultaneous in the divine mind, in which there is no before nor
   after. [795]

   Paul undoubtedly teaches an eternal election by the sovereign grace of
   God, that is an unconditioned and unchangeable predestination of his
   children to holiness and salvation in and through his Son Jesus Christ.
   [796] He thus cuts off all human merit, and plants the salvation upon
   an immovable rock. But he does not thereby exclude human freedom and
   responsibility; on the contrary, he includes them as elements in the
   divine plan, and boldly puts them together. [797] Hence he exhorts and
   warns men as if salvation might be gained or lost by their effort.
   Those who are lost, are lost by their own unbelief. Perdition is the
   righteous judgment for sin unrepented of and persisted in. It is a
   strange misunderstanding to make Paul either a fatalist or a
   particularist; he is the strongest opponent of blind necessity and of
   Jewish particularism, even in the ninth chapter of Romans. But he aims
   at no philosophical solution of a problem which the finite
   understanding of man cannot settle; he contents himself with asserting
   its divine and human aspects, the religious and ethical view, the
   absolute sovereignty of God and the relative freedom of man, the free
   gift of salvation and the just punishment for neglecting it. Christian
   experience includes both truths, and we find no contradiction in
   praying as if all depended on God, and in working as if all depended on
   man. This is Pauline theology and practice.

   Foreknowledge and foreordination are the eternal background of
   salvation: call, justification, sanctification, and glorification mark
   the progressive steps in the time of execution, and of the personal
   application of salvation. [798]

   (2.) The Call (klesis) proceeds from God the Father through the
   preaching of the gospel salvation which is sincerely offered to all.
   Faith comes from preaching, preaching from preachers, and the preachers
   from God who sends them. [799]

   The human act which corresponds to the divine call is the conversion
   (metanoia) of the sinner; and this includes repentance or turning away
   from sin, and faith or turning to Christ, under the influence of the
   Holy Spirit who acts through the word. [800] The Holy Spirit is the
   objective principle of the new life of the Christian. Faith is the free
   gift of God, and at the same time the highest act of man. It is
   unbounded trust in Christ, and the organ by which we apprehend him, his
   very life and benefits, and become as it were identified with him, or
   mystically incorporated with him. [801]

   (3.) Justification (dikaiosis) is the next step. This is a vital
   doctrine in Paul's system and forms the connecting link as well as the
   division line between the Jewish and the Christian period of his life.
   It was with him always a burning life-question. As a Jew he sought
   righteousness by works of the law, honestly and earnestly, but in vain;
   as a Christian he found it, as a free gift of grace, by faith in
   Christ. Righteousness (dikaiosune), as applied to man, is the normal
   relation of man to the holy, will of God as expressed in his revealed
   law, which requires supreme love to God and love to our neighbor; it is
   the moral and religious ideal, and carries in itself the divine favor
   and the highest happiness. It is the very end for which man was made;
   he is to be conformed to God who is absolutely holy and righteous. To
   be god-like is the highest conception of human perfection and bliss.

   But there are two kinds of righteousness, or rather two ways of seeking
   it: one of the law, and sought by works of the law; but this is
   imaginary, at best very defective, and cannot stand before God; and the
   righteousness of Christ, or the righteousness of faith, which is freely
   communicated to the believer and accepted by God. Justification is the
   act of God by which he puts the repenting sinner in possession of the
   righteousness of Christ. It is the reverse of condemnation; it implies
   the remission of sins and the imputation of Christ's righteousness. It
   is based upon the atoning sacrifice of Christ and conditioned by faith,
   as the subjective organ of apprehending and appropriating Christ with
   all his benefits. We are therefore justified by grace alone through
   faith alone; yet faith remains not alone, but is ever fruitful of good
   works.

   The result of justification is peace (eirene) with God, and the state
   of adoption (huiothesia) and this implies also the heirship
   (kleronomia) of eternal life. "The Spirit itself beareth witness with
   our spirit that we are children of God: and if children, then heirs;
   heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with
   him, that we may be also glorified with him." [802] The root of Paul's
   theory of justification is found in the teaching of Christ: he requires
   from his disciples a far better righteousness than the legal
   righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, as a condition of entering
   the kingdom of heaven, namely, the righteousness of God; he holds up
   this righteousness of God as the first object to be sought; and teaches
   that it can only be obtained by faith, which he everywhere presents as
   the one and only condition of salvation on the part of man. [803]

   (4.) Sanctification (hagiasmos). [804] The divine act of justification
   is inseparable from the conversion and renewal of the sinner. It
   affects the will and conduct as well as the feeling. Although
   gratuitous, it is not unconditional. It is of necessity the beginning
   of sanctification, the birth into a new life which is to grow unto full
   manhood. We are not justified outside of Christ, but only in Christ by
   a living faith, which unites us with him in his death unto sin and
   resurrection unto holiness. Faith is operative in love and must produce
   good works as the inevitable proof of its existence. Without love, the
   greatest of Christian graces, even the strongest faith would be but
   "sounding brass or clanging cymbal." [805]

   Sanctification is not a single act, like justification, but a process.
   It is a continuous growth of the whole inner man in holiness from the
   moment of conversion and justification to the reappearance of Jesus
   Christ in glory. [806] On the part of God it is insured, for he is
   faithful and will perfect the good work which he began; on the part of
   man it involves constant watchfulness, lest he stumble and fall. In one
   view it depends all on the grace of God, in another view it depends all
   on the exertion of man. There is a mysterious co-operation between the
   two agencies, which is expressed in the profound paradox: "Work out
   your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who worketh
   in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure." [807] The
   believer is mystically identified with Christ from the moment of his
   conversion (sealed by baptism). He died with Christ unto sin so as to
   sin no more; and he rose with him to a new life unto God so as to live
   for God; he is crucified to the world and the world to him; he is a new
   creature in Christ; the old man of sin is dead and buried, the new man
   lives in holiness and righteousness. "It is no longer I (my own sinful
   self) that lives, but it is Christ that lives in me: and that life
   which I now live in the flesh, I live in faith in the Son of God, who
   loved me and gave himself up for me." [808] Here is the whole doctrine
   of Christian life: it is Christ in us, and we in Christ. It consists in
   a vital union with Christ, the crucified and risen Redeemer, who is the
   indwelling, all-pervading, and controlling life of the believer; but
   the union is no pantheistic confusion or absorption; the believer
   continues to live as a self-conscious and distinct personality. For the
   believer "to live is Christ, and to die is gain." "Whether we live, we
   live unto the Lord; whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we
   live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's." [809]

   In Romans 12, Paul sums up his ethics in the idea of gratitude which
   manifests itself in a cheerful sacrifice of our persons and services to
   the God of our salvation. [810]

   (5.) Glorification (doxazein). This is the final completion of the work
   of grace in the believer and will appear at the parousia of our Lord.
   It cannot be hindered by any power present or future, visible or
   invisible, for God and Christ are stronger than all our enemies and
   will enable us to come out more than conquerors from the conflict of
   faith.

   This lofty conviction of final victory finds most eloquent expression
   in the triumphal ode which closes the eighth chapter of Romans. [811]

   IV. The Historical Progress of the gospel of salvation from Jews to
   Gentiles and back again to the Jews. [812] Salvation was first intended
   for and offered to the Jews, who were for centuries prepared for it by
   the law and the promise, and among whom the Saviour was born, lived,
   died, and rose again. But the Jews as a nation rejected Christ and his
   apostles, and hardened their hearts in unbelief. This fact filled the
   apostle with unutterable sadness, and made him willing to sacrifice
   even his own salvation (if it were possible) for the salvation of his
   kinsmen.

   But he sees light in this dark mystery. First of all, God has a
   sovereign right over all his creatures and manifests both his mercy and
   his righteousness in the successive stages of the historical execution
   of his wise designs. His promise has not failed, for it was not given
   to all the carnal descendants of Abraham and Isaac, but only to the
   spiritual descendants, the true Israelites who have the faith of
   Abraham, and they have been saved, as individual Jews are saved to this
   day. And even in his relation to the vessels of wrath who by unbelief
   and ingratitude have fitted themselves for destruction, he shows his
   long-suffering.

   In the next place, the real cause of the rejection of the body of the
   Jews is their own rejection of Christ. They sought their own
   righteousness by works of the law instead of accepting the
   righteousness of God by faith.

   Finally, the rejection of the Jews is only temporary and incidental in
   the great drama of history. It is overruled for the speedier conversion
   of the Gentiles, and the conversion of the full number or the organic
   totality of the Gentiles (not all individual Gentiles) will lead
   ultimately to the conversion of Israel. "A hardening in part has
   befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; and so
   all Israel shall be saved."

   With this hopeful prophecy, which seems yet far off, but which is
   steadily approaching fulfilment, and will be realized in God's own time
   and way, the apostle closes the doctrinal part of the Epistle to the
   Romans. "God has shut up all men (tous pantas) unto disobedience that
   he might have mercy upon all men. O the depth of the riches both of the
   wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments,
   and his ways past tracing out! ... For of Him (ex autou) and through
   Him (di autou), and unto Him (eis auton') are all things. To Him be the
   glory forever. Amen." [813]

   Before this glorious consummation, however, there will be a terrible
   conflict with Antichrist or "the man of sin," and the full revelation
   of the mystery of lawlessness now held in check. Then the Lord will
   appear as the conqueror in the field, raise the dead, judge the world,
   destroy the last enemy, and restore the kingdom to the Father that God
   may be all in all (ta panta en pasin). [814]

   Notes.

   I. The Pauline System of Doctrine has been more frequently explained
   than any other.

   Among the earlier writers Neander, Usteri, and Schmid take the lead,
   and are still valuable. Neander and Schmid are in full sympathy with
   the spirit and views of Paul. Usteri adapted them somewhat to
   Schleiermacher's system, to which he adhered.

   Next to them the Tübingen school, first the master, Baur (twice, in his
   Paul, and in his New Test. Theology), and then his pupils, Pfleiderer
   and Holsten, have done most for a critical reproduction. They rise far
   above the older rationalism in an earnest and intelligent appreciation
   of the sublime theology of Paul, and leave the impression that he was a
   most profound, bold, acute, and consistent thinker on the highest
   themes. But they ignore the supernatural element of inspiration, they
   lack spiritual sympathy with the faith of the apostle, overstrain his
   antagonism to Judaism (as did Marcion of old), and confine the
   authentic sources to the four anti-Judaic Epistles to the Galatians,
   Romans, and Corinthians, although recognizing in the minor Epistles the
   "paulinische Grundlage." The more moderate followers of Baur, however,
   now admit the genuineness of from seven to ten Pauline Epistles,
   leaving only the three Pastoral Epistles and Ephesians in serious
   doubt.

   The Paulinismus of Weiss (in the third ed. of his Bibl. Theol., 1881,
   pp. 194-472) is based upon a very careful philological exegesis in
   detail, and is in this respect the most valuable of all attempts to
   reproduce Paul's theology. He divides it into three sections: 1st, the
   system of the four great doctrinal and polemical Epistles; 2d, the
   further development of Paulinism in the Epistles of the captivity; 3d,
   the doctrine of the Pastoral Epistles. He doubts only the genuineness
   of the last group, but admits a progress from the first to the second.

   Of French writers, Reuss, Pressensé, and Sabatier give the best
   expositions of the Pauline system, more or less in imitation of German
   labors. Reuss, of Strasburg, who writes in German as well, is the most
   independent and learned; Pressensé is more in sympathy with Paul's
   belief, but gives only a meagre summary; Sabatier leans to the Tübingen
   school. Reuss discusses Paul's system (in vol. III., 17-220) very fully
   under these heads: righteousness; sin; the law; the gospel; God; the
   person of Christ; the work of Christ; typical relation of the old and
   new covenant; faith; election; calling and the Holy Spirit;
   regeneration; redemption; justification and reconciliation; church;
   hope and trial; last times; kingdom of God. Sabatier (L'apôtre Paul,
   pp. 249-318, second ed., 1881) more briefly but clearly develops the
   Pauline theology from the Christological point of view (la personne de
   Christ Principe générateur de la conscience chrétienne) under three
   heads: lot, the Christian principle in the psychological sphere
   (anthropology); 2d, in the social and historical sphere (religious
   philosophy of history); 3d, in the metaphysical sphere (theology),
   which culminates in the theos ta panta en pasin"Ainsi naît et grandit
   cet arbre magnifique de la pensée de Paul, dont les racines plongent
   dans le sol de la conscience chrétienne et dont la cime est dans les
   cieux."

   Renan, who professes so much sentimental admiration for the poetry and
   wisdom of Jesus, "the charming Galilaean peasant," has no organ for the
   theology of Paul any more than Voltaire had for the poetry of
   Shakespeare. He regards him as a bold and vigorous, but uncouth and
   semi-barbarous genius, full of rabbinical subtleties, useless
   speculations, and polemical intolerance even against good old Peter at
   Antioch.

   Several doctrines of Paul have been specially discussed by German
   scholars, as Tischendorf: Doctrina Pauli apostoli de Vi Mortis Christi
   Satisfactoria (Leipz., 1837); Räbiger: De Christologia Paulina
   (Breslau, 1852); Lipsius: Die paulinische Rechtfertigunglehre (Leipz.,
   1853); Ernesti: Vom Ursprung der Sünde nach paulinischem Lehrgehalt
   (Wolfenbüttel, 1855); Die Ethik des Paulus (Braunschweig, 1868; 3d ed.,
   1881); W. Beyschlag Die paulinische Theodicee (Berlin, 1868); R.
   Schmidt: Die Christologie des Ap. Paulus (Gött., 1870); A. Delitzsch:
   Adam und Christus (Bonn, 1871); H. Lüdemann: Die Anthropologie des Ap.
   Paulus (Kiel, 1872); R. Stähelin: Zur paulinischen Eschatologie (1874);
   A. Schumann:Der weltgeschichtl. Entwickelungsprocess nach dem
   Lehrsystem des Ap. Paulus (Crefeld, 1875); Fr. Köstlin: Die Lehre des
   Paulus von der Auferstehung (1877); H. H. Wendt: Die Begriffe Fleisch
   und Geist in biblischen Sprachgebrauch (Gotha, 1878).

   II. The Christology of Paul is closely interwoven with his soteriology.
   In Romans and Galatians the soteriological aspect prevails, in
   Philippians and Colossians the christological. His christology is very
   rich, and with that of the Epistle to the Hebrews prepares the way for
   the christology of John. It is even more fully developed than John's,
   only less prominent in the system.

   The chief passages on the person of Christ are: Rom. 1:3, 4 (ek
   spermatos Daueid kata sarka ... huios theou kata pneuma hagiosunes);
   8:3 (ho theos ton eautou huion pempsas en homoiomati sarkos hamartias)
   8:32 (hos tou idiou huiou ouk epheisato) 9:5 (ex hon ho Christos to
   kata sarka, ho on epi panton, theos eulogetos eis tous aionas--but the
   punctuation and consequently the application of the doxology--whether
   to God or to Christ--are disputed); 1 Cor. 1:19 (ho kurios hemon, a
   very frequent designation); 2 Cor. 5:21 (ton me gnonta hamartian); 8:9
   (eptocheusen plousios on, hina humeis te ekeinou ptocheia ploutesete);
   Phil. 2:5-11 (the famous passage about thekenosis); Col. 1:15-18 (hos
   estin eikon tou theou tou aoratou prototokos pases kriseos, hoti en
   auto ekristhe ta pan'ta ... ta panta di autou kaii eis auton
   ektistai...); 2:9 (en auto katoikei pan to pleroma tes theotetos
   somatikos); 1 Tim. 3:16 (hos ephanerothe en sarki...); Tit.2:13 (tou
   megalou theou kai soteros hemon Christou Iesou, where, however,
   commentators differ in the construction, as in Rom. 9:5).

   From these and other passages the following doctrinal points may be
   inferred:

   1.The eternal pre-existence of Christ as to his divine nature. The
   pre-existence generally is implied in Rom. 8:3, 32; 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil.
   2:5; the pre-existence before the creation is expressly asserted, Col.
   1:15; the eternity of this pre-existence is a metaphysical inference
   from the nature of the case, since an existence before all creation
   must be an uncreated, therefore a divine or eternal existence which has
   no beginning as well as no end. (John carefully distinguishes between
   the eternal enof the pre-existent Logos, and the temporal egenetoof the
   incarnate Logos, John 1:1, 14; comp. 8:58.) This is not inconsistent
   with the designation of Christ as "the first-born of all creation,"
   Col. 1:15; for prototokosis different from protoktistos(first-created),
   as the Nicene fathers already remarked, in opposition to Arius, who
   inferred from the passage that Christ was the first creature of God and
   the creator of all other creatures. The word first-born corresponds to
   the Johannean monogenes,only-begotten. "Both express," as Lightfoot
   says (Com. on Col.) "the same eternal fact; but while monogenesstates
   it in itself, prototokosplaces it in relation to the universe." We may
   also compare the protogonos,first-begotten, which Philo applies to the
   Logos, as including the original archetypal idea of the created world.
   "The first-born," used absolutely (prototokosbkrr Ps. 89:28), became a
   recognized title of the Messiah. Moreover, the genitive pases ktiseosis
   not the partitive, but the comparative genitive: the first-born as
   compared with, that is, before, every creature. So Justin Martyr (pro
   panton ton ktismaton), Meyer, and Bp. Lightfoot, in loc.; also Weiss,
   Bibl. Theol. d. N. T., p. 431 (who refutes the opposite view of Usteri,
   Reuss, and Baur, and says: "Da pases kriseosjede einzelne Creatur
   bezeichnet, so kann der Genii. nur comparativ genommen werden, und nur
   besagen, dass er im Vergleich mit jeden Creatur der Erstgeborne war").
   The words immediately following, John 1:16, 17, exclude the possibility
   of regarding Christ himself as a creature. Lightfoot, in his masterly
   Comm. (p. 212 sq.), very fully explains the term as teaching the
   absolute pre-existence of the Son, his priority to and sovereignty over
   all creation.

   The recent attempt of Dr. Beyschlag (Christologie des N. T., pp. 149
   sqq., 242 sqq.) to resolve the pre-existent Christ of Paul and John
   into an ideal principle, instead of a real personality, is an
   exegetical failure, like the similar attempts of the Socinians, and is
   as far from the mark as the interpretation of some of the Nicene
   fathers (e.g., Marcellus) who, in order to escape the Arian argument,
   understood prototokos of the incarnate Logos as the head of the new
   spiritual creation.

   2. Christ is the mediator and the end of creation. "All things were
   created in him, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and
   things invisible ...; all things have been created through him (di
   autouand unto him (eis auton); and he is before all things, and in him
   all things consist," Col. 1:15-18. The same doctrine is taught in 1
   Cor. 8:6 ("Jesus Christ, through whom are all things"); 10;9; 15:47; as
   well as in the Ep. to the Hebrews 1:2: ("through whom he also made the
   worlds" or "ages"), and in John 1:3.

   3. The divinity of Christ is clearly implied in the constant
   co-ordination of Christ with the Father as the author of "grace and
   peace," in the salutations of the Epistles, and in such expressions as,
   "the image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15); "in him dwells the
   fulness of the Godhead bodily" (2:9): "existing in the form of God,"
   and "being on an equality with God" (Phil. 2:6). In two passages he is,
   according to the usual interpretation, even called "God" (theos), but,
   as already remarked, the exegetes are still divided on the reference of
   theosin Rom. 9:5 and Tit. 2:13. Meyer admits that Paul, according to
   his christology, could call Christ "God" (as predicate, without the
   article, theosnot ho theos); and Weiss, in the 6th edition of Meyer on
   Romans (1881), adopts the prevailing orthodox punctuation and
   interpretation in Rom. 9:5 as the most natural, on purely exegetical
   grounds (the necessity of a supplement to kata sarka, and the position
   of eulogetosafter theos): "Christ as concerning the flesh, who [at the
   same time according to his higher nature] is over all, even God blessed
   for ever." Westcott and Hort are not quite agreed on the punctuation.
   See their note in Greek Test., Introd. and Appendix, p. 109.

   4. The incarnation. This is designated by the terms "God sent his own
   Son (Rom. 8:3, comp. 8:32); Christ "emptied himself, taking the form of
   a servant, being made in the likeness of men" (Phil. 2:7). Without
   entering here into the Kenosis controversy (the older one between
   Giessen and Tübingen, 1620-1630, and the recent one which began with
   Thomasius, 1845), it is enough to say that the Kenosis, or
   self-exinanition, refers not to the incarnate, but to the pre-existent
   Son of God, and implies a certain kind of self-limitation or temporary
   surrender of the divine mode of existence during the state of
   humiliation. This humiliation was followed by exaltation as a reward
   for his obedience unto death (Phil 2:9-11); hence he is now "the Lord
   of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8). To define the limits of the Kenosis, and to
   adjust it to the immutability of the Godhead and the intertrinitarian
   process, lies beyond the sphere of exegesis and belongs to speculative
   dogmatics.

   5. The true, but sinless humanity of Christ. He appeared "in the
   likeness of the flesh of sin" (Rom. 8:3); he is a son of David
   "according to the flesh" (1:3), which includes the whole human nature,
   body, soul, and spirit (as in John 1:14); he is called a man
   (anthropos) in the full sense of the term (1 Cor. 15:21; Rom. 5:15;
   Acts 17:31). He was "born of a woman, born under the law"(Gal. 4:4); he
   was "found in fashion as a man" and became "obedient even unto death"
   (Phil. 2:8), and he truly suffered and died, like other men. But he
   "knew no sin" (2 Cor. 5:21). He could, of course, not be the Saviour of
   sinners if he himself were a sinner and in need of salvation.

   Of the events of Christ's life, Paul mentions especially and frequently
   his death and resurrection, on which our salvation depends. He also
   reports the institution of the Lord's Supper, which perpetuates the
   memory and the blessing of the atoning sacrifice on the cross (1 Cor.
   11:23-30). He presupposes, of course, a general knowledge of the
   historical Christ, as his Epistles are all addressed to believing
   converts; but he incidentally preserves a gem of Christ's sayings not
   reported by the Evangelists, which shines like a lone star on the
   firmament of uncertain traditions:, "It is more blessed to give than to
   receive" (Acts 20:35).

   III. Paul's Doctrine of Predestination.--Eternal foreknowledge of all
   persons and things is necessarily included in God's omniscience, and is
   uniformly taught in the Bible; eternal foreordination or predestination
   is included in his almighty power and sovereignty, but must be so
   conceived as to leave room for free agency and responsibility, and to
   exclude God from the authorship of sin. Self-limitation is a part of
   freedom even in man, and may be exercised by the sovereign God for holy
   purposes and from love to his creatures; in fact it is necessary, if
   salvation is to be a moral process, and not a physical or mechanical
   necessity. Religion is worth nothing except as the expression of free
   conviction and voluntary devotion. Paul represents sometimes the divine
   sovereignty, sometimes the human responsibility, sometimes, as in Phil.
   2:12, 13, he combines both sides, without an attempt to solve the
   insolvable problem which really lies beyond the present capacity of the
   human mind. "He does not deal with speculative extremes; and in
   whatever way the question be speculatively adjusted, absolute
   dependence and moral self-determination are both involved in the
   immediate Christian self-consciousness," Baur, Paul, II. 249.
   "Practical teaching," says Reuss (II. 532) to the same effect, "will
   always be constrained to insist upon the fact that man's salvation is a
   free gift of God, and that his condemnation is only the just punishment
   of sin." Comp. also Farrar, St. Paul, II. 243, 590; Weiss, p. 356 sqq.;
   Beyschlag, Die paulinische Theodicee (Berlin, 1868). Weiss thus sums up
   Paul's doctrine of predestination: "An sich hat Gott das absolute
   Becht, die Menschen von vornherein zum Heil oder zum Verderben zu
   erschaffen und durch freie Machtwirkung diesem Ziele zuzuführen; aber
   er hat sich in Betreff des christlichen Heils dieses Rechtes nur
   insofern bedient, als er unabhängig von allem menschlichen Thun und
   Verdienen nach seinem unbeschränkten Willen bestimmt, an welche
   Bedingung er seine Gnade knüpfen will. Die Bedingung, an welche er
   seine Erwählung gebunden hat, ist nun nichts anders als die Liebe zu
   ihm, welche er an den empfänglichen Seelen vorhererkennt. Die Erwählten
   aber werden berufen, indem Gott durch das Evangelium in ihnen den
   Glauben wirkt."

   There can be no doubt that Paul teaches an eternal election to eternal
   salvation by free grace, an election which is to be actualized by faith
   in Christ and a holy life of obedience. But he does not teach a decree
   of reprobation or a predestination to sin and perdition (which would
   indeed be a "decretum horribile," if verum). This is a logical
   invention of supralapsarian theologians who deem it to be the necessary
   counterpart of the decree of election. But man's logic is not God's
   logic. A decree of reprobation is nowhere mentioned. The term
   adokimos,disapproved, worthless, reprobate, is used five times only as
   a description of character (twice of things). Romans 9 is the Gibraltar
   of supralapsarianism, but it must be explained in connection with Rom.
   10-11, which present the other aspects. The strongest passage is Rom.
   9:22, where Paul speaks of skeue orges katertismena eis apoleian. But
   he significantly uses here the passive: "fitted unto destruction," or
   rather (as many of the best commentators from Chrysostom to Weiss take
   it) the middle: "who fitted themselves for destruction," and so
   deserved it; while of the vessels of mercy he says that God "before
   prepared" them unto glory (skeue eleous ha proetoimasen, 9:23). He
   studiously avoids to say of the vessels of wrath: ha katertisen, which
   would have corresponded to ha proetoimasen, and thus he exempts God
   from a direct and efficient agency in sin and destruction. When in
   9:17, he says of Pharaoh, that God raised him up for the very purpose
   (eis auto touto exegeira se) that he might show in him His power, he
   does not mean that God created him or called him into existence (which
   would require a different verb), but, according to the Hebrew (Ex.
   9:16, the hiphil of ?md), that "he caused him to stand forth" as actor
   in the scene; and when he says with reference to the same history that
   God "hardens whom he will" (Rom. 9:18. hon de thelei sklerunei), it
   must be remembered that Pharaoh had already repeatedly hardened his own
   heart (Ex. 8:15, 32; 9:34, 35), so that God punished him for his sin
   and abandoned him to its consequences. God does not cause evil, but he
   bends, guides, and overrules it and often punishes sin with sin. "Das
   ist der Fluch der bösen That, dass sie, fortzeugend, immer Böses muss
   gebären." (Schiller.)

   In this mysterious problem of predestination Paul likewise faithfully
   carries out the teaching of his Master. For in the sublime description
   of the final judgment, Christ says to the "blessed of my Father:"
   "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"
   (Matt. 25:34), but to those on the left hand he says, "Depart from me,
   ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and
   his angels" (25:41). The omission of the words "of my Father," after
   "ye cursed," and of the words, for you, "and, from the foundation of
   the world," is very significant, and implies that while the inheritance
   of the kingdom is traced to the eternal favor of God, the damnation is
   due to the guilt of man.

   IV. The doctrine of Justification. This occupies a prominent space in
   Paul's system, though by no means to the disparagement of his doctrine
   of sanctification, which is treated with the same fulness even in
   Romans (comp. Rom. 6-8 and 12-15). Luther, in conflict with Judaizing
   Rome, overstated the importance of justification by faith when he
   called it the articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae. This can only
   be said of Christ (comp. Matt. 16:16; 1 Cor. 3:11; 1 John 4:2, 3). It
   is not even the theme of the Epistle to the Romans, as often stated
   (e.g., by Farrar, St. Paul, II. 181); for it is there subordinated by
   garto the broader idea of salvation (soteria), which is the theme (Rom
   1:16, 17). Justification by faith is the way by which salvation can be
   obtained.

   The doctrine of justification may be thus illustrated:

   Dikaiosune

   ( qdts ,hqdts)

   Dikaiosune tou nomou Dikaiosune tou theou

   ex ergon ek theou

   idia. te s pisteos

   ek te s pisteos

   dia pisteos Christou.

   The cognate words are dikaiosis, dikaioma, dikaios, dikaioo. The
   Pauline idea of righteousness is derived from the Old Testament, and is
   inseparable from the conception of the holy will of God and his
   revealed law. But the classical usage is quite consistent with it, and
   illustrates the biblical usage from a lower plane. The Greek words are
   derived from jus, right, and further back from. dicha, or div",
   two-fold, in two parts (according to Aristotle, Eth. Nic., v. 2); hence
   they indicate a well-proportioned relation between parts or persons
   where each has his due. It may then apply to the relation between God
   and man, or to the relation between man and man, or to both at once. To
   the Greeks a righteous man was one who fulfils his obligations to God
   and man. It was a Greek proverb: "In righteousness all virtue is
   contained."

   Dikaiosune(qdts hqdts) is an attribute of God, and a corresponding
   moral condition of man, i.e., man's conformity to the will of God as
   expressed in his holy law. It is therefore identical with true
   religion, with piety and virtue, as required by God, and insures his
   favor and blessing. The word occurs (according to Bruder's Concord.)
   sixty times in all the Pauline Epistles, namely: thirty-six times in
   Romans, four times in Galatians, seven times in 2 Corinthians, once in
   1 Corinthians, four times in Philippians, three times in Ephesians,
   three times in 2 Timothy, once in 1 Timothy, and once in Titus.

   Dikaios(qydts) righteous (rechtbeschaffen), is one who fulfils his
   duties to God and men, and is therefore well pleasing to God. It is
   used seventeen times by Paul (seven times in Romans), and often
   elsewhere in the New Testament.

   Dikaiosisoccurs only twice in the New Test. (Rom. 4:25; 5:18). It
   signifies justification, or the act of God by which he puts the sinner
   into the possession of righteousness.

   Dikaioma, which is found Rom. 1:32; 2:26; 5:16, 18; 8:4 means a
   righteous decree, or judgment. Aristotle (Eth. Nicom., v. 10) defines
   it as to epanorthoma tou adikematos,the amendment of an evil deed, or a
   legal adjustment; and this would suit the passage in Rom. 5:16, 18.

   The verb dikaioo(qdts , qydtsh)occurs twenty-seven times in Paul,
   mostly in Romans, several times in the Synoptical Gospels, once in
   Acts, and three times in James 2:21, 24, 25. It may mean,
   etymologically, to make just, justificare (for the verbs in oo, derived
   from adjectives of the second declension, indicate the making of what
   the adjective denotes, e.g., deloo, to make clear, phaneroo, to
   reveal,tuphloo, to blind); but in the Septuagint and the Greek
   Testament it hardly, ever has this meaning ("haec significatio," says
   Grimm, "admodum rara, nisi prorsus dubia est"), and is used in a
   forensic or judicial sense: to declare one righteous (aliquem justum
   declarare, judicare). This justification of the sinner is, of course,
   not a legal fiction, but perfectly true, for it is based on the real
   righteousness of Christ which the sinner makes his own by faith, and
   must prove his own by a life of holy obedience, or good works. For
   further expositions see my annotations to Lange on Romans, pp. 74, 130,
   136, 138; and my Com on Gal. 2:16, 17. On the imputation controversies
   see my essay in Lange on Romans 5:12, pp. 190-195. On the relation of
   Paul's doctrine of justification to that of James, see § 69 of this
   vol.

   V. Paul's doctrine of the Church has been stated in § 65 of this vol.

   wonderful theology of this wonderful
     __________________________________________________________________

   [774] Dr. Baur, who was formerly disposed to make Paul the founder of
   Christian universalism, admits in his last elaboration of the Pauline
   system (N. T. liche Theol., p. 128), that "Paul only expressed to the
   consciousness what in itself, in principle and actually, or by
   implication, was contained already in the doctrine of Jesus (was an
   sich principiell und thatsächlich, oder implicite schon in der Lehre
   Jesu enthalten war)."Pressensé misstates here Baur's position, but
   himself correctly calls Paul's doctrine "as a whole and in all its
   parts, the logical deduction and development of the teaching of the
   Master" (Apost. Era, p. 255).

   [775] 1 Cor. 1:30; 2:2.

   [776] 1 Cor. 15:13.

   [777] Rom. 4: 23. The first dia is retrospective, the second
   prospective: for the destruction of sin and for the procurement of
   righteousness.

   [778] Rom. 1:17: dunamis theou eis soterian panti to pisteuonti ,
   Ioudaio te [proton]kai Helleni. Other pregnant passages in which Paul
   summarizes his dogmatics and ethics, are Rom. 1:16, 17:3: 21-26; 4:25;
   11:32; 1 Cor. 15:22; Gal. 3:22; Tit. 3:3-7.

   [779] Rom. 1:18; 3:20. First the depravity of the heathen, then that of
   the Jews (2:1, comp. 2:17).

   [780] Rom. 1:18-21; 2:14-16; comp. Acts 17:28.

   [781] The Augustinian application of this conflict to the regenerate
   state, involves Rom. 7 in contradiction with Rom. 6 and 8, and
   obliterates the distinction between the regenerate and the unregenerate
   state. Augustine understood that chapter better in his earlier years,
   before the Pelagian controversy drove him to such an extreme view of
   total depravity as destroys all freedom and responsibility. We see here
   the difference between an inspired apostle and an enlightened
   theologian. The chief object of Rom. 7 is to show that the law cannot
   sanctify any more than it can justify (Rom. 3), and that the legal
   conflict with the sinful flesh ends in total failure. Paul always uses
   here nous for the higher principle in man (including reason and
   conscience); while in Rom. 8, where he speaks of the regenerate man, he
   uses pneuma, which is the nous sanctified and enlightened by the Holy
   Spirit. In 8:25 he indeed alludes to the regenerate state by way of
   anticipation and as an immediate answer to the preceding cry for
   redemption; but from this expression of thanks he once more points back
   with ara oun to the previous state of bondage before he enters more
   fully with ara nun into the state of freedom.

   [782] 1 Tim. 1:15; 2:4, 6; Tit. 2:11. Particularistic restrictions of
   "all" in these passages are arbitrary. The same doctrine is taught 2
   Pet. 3:9, and John 3:16; 1 John 2:2. The last passage is as clear as
   the sun: "Christ is the propitiation (hilasmos) for our sins; and not
   for ours only, but also for the whole world"(ou monon ... alla kai peri
   holou tou kosmou ).

   [783] Rom. 5:12-21; 1 Cor. 15:1, 22. The pantes and the hoi polloi
   (which is equivalent to pantes and opposed, not to a few, but to the
   one) in the second clause referring to the second Adam, is as
   comprehensive and unlimited as in the first clause. The English Version
   weakens the force of hoi polloi, and limits the number by omitting the
   article. The pollo mallon (Rom. 5:15, 17) predicated of Christ's saving
   grace, is not a numerical, nor a logical, but a dynamic plus,
   indicating a higher degree of efficacy, insomuch as Christ brought far
   greater blessings than we lost in Adam.

   [784] Rom. 11:32; Gal. 8:22. These contain the briefest statement of
   the sad mystery of the fall cleared up by the blessed mystery of
   redemption. In the first passage the masculine is used (tous pantas),
   in the second the neuter (ta panta), and the application is confined to
   believers (tois pisteuousin).

   promises to develop the whole system from thus idea in his new work,
   Das Evangelium des Paulus, of which the first part appeared in 1880.
   But they deny the objective character of the revelation at Damascus,
   and resolve it into a subjective moral struggle and a dialectical
   process of reflection and reasoning. Luther passed through a similar
   moral conflict and reached the same conclusion, but on the basis of the
   Scriptures and with the aid of the divine Spirit.

   26:5; 1 Pet. 1:20), the noun prognosis twice (Acts 2:23; 1 Pet. 1:2),
   always, as in classical Greek, in the sense of previous knowledge (not
   election). The verb proorizooccurs six times, and means always to
   foreordain, to determine before. The words eklego and eklegomai,
   ekloge, eklektos occur much more frequently, mostly with reference to
   eternal choice or election. See note below.

   In this sense it does not occur in Paul, but in James 1:17. 2d,
   conviction of the invisible and supernatural; 2 Cor. 5:7, pistis as
   distinct from heidos. 3d, religious conviction, 1 Cor. 2:5; 2 Cor.

   the specific Christian faith, Rom. 3:22; 1 Cor. 15:14; Gal, 1:23, and
   always where justifying faith is meant. Weiss (p. 316) defines the
   Pauline idea of justifying faith as " the very opposite of all the
   works required by the law; it is no human performance, but, on the
   contrary, an abandonment of all work of our own, an unconditional
   reliance on God who justifies, or on Christ as the Mediator of
   salvation. "But this is only the receptive side of faith, it has an
   active side as well, pistis is energoumene di agapes. See below.

   a blessing which we should grasp and fully enjoy--an exhortation well
   suited for Judaizing and gloomy Christians who groan under legal
   bondage. On justification see the notes below.

   from heat," is in the very spirit of Paul, and a sufficient reply to
   the slander brought against the doctrine of justification by faith as
   being antinomian in its tendency.

   unsurpassed for genuine eloquence: "Quid unquam Cicero dixit
   grandiloquentius It is only equalled by the ode on love in 1".

   [812] This is the subject of Rom. 9-11. These three chapters contain a
   theodicy and an outline of the philosophy of church history. They are
   neither the chief part of Romans (Baur), nor a mere episode or appendix
   (De Wette), but an essential part of the Epistle in exposition of the
   concluding clause of the theme, Rom. 1:17 ... "to the Jew first, and
   also to the Greek" (or Gentile). Romans 9 treats of divine sovereignty;
   Rom. 10 (which should begin at Rom. 9:30) treats of human
   responsibility; Rom. 11 of the future solution of this great problem.
   They must be taken together as a unit. Romans 9 alone may be and has
   been made to prove Calvinism and even extreme supralapsarianism; Rom.
   10 Arminianism; and Rom. 11 Universalism. But Paul is neither a
   Calvinist nor an Arminian nor a Universalist in the dogmatic sense. See

   §72. John and the Gospel of Love.

   (See the Lit. in § 40 p. 405.)

   General Character.

   The unity of Jewish Christian and Gentile Christian theology meets us
   in the writings of John, who, in the closing decades of the first
   century, summed up the final results of the preceding struggles of the
   apostolic age and transmitted them to posterity. Paul had fought out
   the great conflict with Judaism and secured the recognition of the
   freedom and universality of the gospel for all time to come. John
   disposes of this question with one sentence: "The law was given through
   Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." [815] His theology
   marks the culminating height of divine knowledge in the apostolic age.
   It is impossible to soar higher than the eagle, which is his proper
   symbol. [816] His views are so much identified with the words of his
   Lord, to whom he stood more closely related than any other disciple,
   that it is difficult to separate them; but the prologue to his Gospel
   contains his leading ideas, and his first Epistle the practical
   application. The theology of the Apocalypse is also essentially the
   same, and this goes far to confirm the identity of authorship. [817]

   John was not a logician, but a seer; not a reasoner, but a mystic; he
   does not argue, but assert; he arrives at conclusions with one bound,
   as by direct intuition. He speaks from personal experience and
   testifies of that which his eyes have seen and his ears heard and his
   hands have handled, of the glory of the Only-begotten of the Father
   full of grace and truth. [818]

   John's theology is marked by artless simplicity and spiritual depth.
   The highest art conceals art. As in poetry, so in religion, the most
   natural is the most perfect. He moves in a small circle of ideas as
   compared with Paul, but these ideas are fundamental and
   all-comprehensive. He goes back to first principles and sees the strong
   point without looking sideways or taking note of exceptions. Christ and
   Antichrist, believers and unbelievers, children of God and children of
   the devil, truth and falsehood, light and darkness, love and hatred,
   life and death: these are the great contrasts under which he views the
   religious world. These he sets forth again and again with majestic
   simplicity.

   John and Paul.

   John's type of doctrine is less developed and fortified than Paul's,
   but more ideal. His mind was neither so rich nor so strong, but it
   soared higher and anticipated the beatific vision. Although Paul was
   far superior to him as a scholar (and practical worker), yet the
   ancient Greek church saw in John the ideal theologian. [819] John's
   spirit and style may be compared to a calm, clear mountain-lake which
   reflects the image of the sun) moon, and stars, while Paul resembles
   the mountain-torrent that rushes over precipices and carries everything
   before it; yet there are trumpets of war in John, and anthems of peace
   in Paul. The one begins from the summit, with God and the Logos, the
   other from the depths of man's sin and misery; but both meet in the
   God-man who brings God down to man and lifts man up to God. John is
   contemplative and serene, Paul is aggressive and polemical; but both
   unite in the victory of faith and the never-ending dominion of love.
   John's theology is Christological, Paul's soteriological; John starts
   from the person of Christ, Paul from his work; but their christology
   and soteriology are essentially agreed. John's ideal is life eternal,
   Paul's ideal is righteousness; but both derive it from the same source,
   the union with Christ, and find in this the highest happiness of man.
   John represents the church triumphant, Paul the church militant of his
   day and of our day, but with the full assurance of final victory even
   over the last enemy.

   The Central Idea.

   John's Christianity centres in the idea of love and life, which in
   their last root are identical. His dogmatics are summed up in the word:
   God first loved us; his ethics in the exhortation: Therefore let us
   love Him and the brethren. He is justly called the apostle of love.
   Only we must not understand this word in a sentimental, but in the
   highest and purest moral sense. God's love is his self-communication to
   man; man's love is a holy self-consecration to God. We may
   recognize--in rising stages of transformation--the same fiery spirit in
   the Son of Thunder who called vengeance from heaven; in the Apocalyptic
   seer who poured out the vials of wrath against the enemies of Christ;
   and in the beloved disciple who knew no middle ground, but demanded
   undivided loyalty and whole-souled devotion to his Master. In him the
   highest knowledge and the highest love coincide: knowledge is the eye
   of love, love the heart of knowledge; both constitute eternal life, and
   eternal life is the fulness of happiness. [820]

   The central truth of John and the central fact in Christianity itself
   is the incarnation of the eternal Logos as the highest manifestation of
   God's love to the world. The denial of this truth is the criterion of
   Antichrist. [821]

   The Principal Doctrines.

   I. The doctrine of God. He is spirit (pneuma), he is light (phos) he is
   love (agape). [822] These are the briefest and yet the profoundest
   definitions which can be given of the infinite Being of all beings. The
   first is put into the mouth of Christ, the second and third are from
   the pen of John. The first sets forth God's metaphysical, the second
   his intellectual, the third his moral perfection; but they are blended
   in one.

   God is spirit, all spirit, absolute spirit (in opposition to every
   materialistic conception and limitation); hence omnipresent,
   all-pervading, and should be worshipped, whether in Jerusalem or
   Gerizim or anywhere else, in spirit and in truth.

   God is light, all light without a spot of darkness, and the fountain of
   all light, that is of truth, purity, and holiness.

   God is love; this John repeats twice, looking upon love as the inmost
   moral essence of God, which animates, directs, and holds together all
   other attributes; it is the motive power of his revelations or
   self-communications, the beginning and the end of his ways and works,
   the core of his manifestation in Christ.

   II. The doctrine of Christ's Person. He is the eternal and the
   incarnate Logos or Revealer of God. No man has ever yet seen God
   (theon, without the article, God's nature, or God as God); the
   only-begotten Son (or God only-begotten), [823] who is in the bosom
   [824] of the Father, he and he alone (ekeinos) declared him and brought
   to light, once and forever, the hidden mystery of his being. [825]

   This perfect knowledge of the Father, Christ claims himself in that
   remarkable passage in Matthew 11:27, which strikingly confirms the
   essential harmony of the Johannean and Synoptical representations of
   Christ.

   John (and he alone) calls Christ the "Logos" of God, i.e., the
   embodiment of God and the organ of all his revelations. [826] As the
   human reason or thought is expressed in word, and as the word is the
   medium of making our thoughts known to others, so God is known to
   himself and to the world in and through Christ as the personal Word.
   While "Logos" designates the metaphysical and intellectual relation,
   the term "Son" designates the moral relation of Christ to God, as a
   relation of love, and the epithet "only-begotten" or "only-born"
   (monogenes) raises his sonship as entirely unique above every other
   sonship, which is only a reflection of it. It is a blessed relation of
   infinite knowledge and infinite love. The Logos is eternal, he is
   personal, he is divine. [827] He was in the beginning before creation
   or from eternity. He is, on the one hand, distinct from God and in the
   closest communion with him (pros ton theon); on the other hand he is
   himself essentially divine, and therefore called "God" (theos, but not
   ho theos). [828]

   This pre-existent Logos is the agent of the creation of all things
   visible and invisible. [829] He is the fulness and fountain of life (he
   zoe, the true, immortal life, as distinct from bios, the natural,
   mortal life), and light (to phos,which includes intellectual and moral
   truth, reason and conscience) to all men. Whatever elements of truth,
   goodness, and beauty may be found shining like stars and meteors in the
   darkness of heathendom, must be traced to the Logos, the universal
   Life-giver and Illuminator.

   Here Paul and John meet again; both teach the agency of Christ in the
   creation, but John more clearly connects him with all the preparatory
   revelations before the incarnation. This extension of the Logos
   revelation explains the high estimate which some of the Greek fathers,
   (Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen) put upon the Hellenic,
   especially the Platonic philosophy, as a training-school of the heathen
   mind for Christ.

   The Logos revealed himself to every man, but in a special manner to his
   own chosen people; and this revelation culminated in John the Baptist,
   who summed up in himself the meaning of the law and the prophets, and
   pointed to Jesus of Nazareth as "the Lamb of God that taketh away the
   sin of the world."

   At last the Logos became flesh. [830] He completed his revelation by
   uniting himself with man once and forever in all things, except sin.
   [831] The Hebraizing term "flesh" best expresses his condescension to
   our fallen condition and the complete reality of his humanity as an
   object of sense, visible and tangible, in strong contrast with his
   immaterial divinity. It includes not only the body (soma), but also a
   human soul (psuche) and a rational spirit (nous, pneuma); for John
   ascribes them all to Christ. To use a later terminology, the
   incarnation (ensarkosis,incarnatio) is only a stronger term for the
   assumption of humanity (enanthropesis,Menschwerdung). The Logos became
   man--not partially but totally, not apparently but really, not
   transiently but permanently, not by ceasing to be divine, nor by being
   changed into a man, but by an abiding, personal union with man. He is
   henceforth the Godman. He tabernacled on earth as the true Shekinah,
   and manifested to his disciples the glory of the only begotten which
   shone from the veil of his humanity. [832] This is the divine-human
   glory in the state of humiliation as distinct from the divine glory in
   his preexistent state, and from the final and perfect manifestation of
   his glory in the state of exaltation in which his disciples shall
   share. [833]

   The fourth Gospel is a commentary on the ideas of the Prologue. It was
   written for the purpose that the readers may believe "that Jesus is the
   Christ (the promised Messiah), the Son of God (in the sense of the only
   begotten and eternal Son), and that believing they may have life in his
   name." [834]

   III. The Work of Christ (Soteriology). This implies the conquest over
   sin and Satan, and the procurement of eternal life. Christ appeared
   without sin, to the end that he might destroy the works of the devil,
   who was a liar and murderer from the beginning of history, who first
   fell away from the truth and then brought sin and death into mankind.
   [835] Christ laid down his life and shed his blood for his sheep. By
   this self-consecration in death he became the propitiation (hilasmos)
   for the sins of believers and for the sins of the whole world. [836]
   His blood cleanses from all the guilt and contamination of sin. He is
   (in the language of the Baptist) the Lamb of God that bears and takes
   away the sin of the world; and (in the unconscious prophecy of
   Caiaphas) he died for the people. [837] He was priest and sacrifice in
   one person. And he continues his priestly functions, being our Advocate
   in Heaven and ready to forgive us when we sin and come to him in true
   repentance. [838]

   This is the negative part of Christ's work, the removal of the
   obstruction which separated us from God. The positive part consists in
   the revelation of the Father, and in the communication of eternal life,
   which includes eternal happiness. He is himself the Life and the Light
   of the world. [839] He calls himself the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
   In him the true, the eternal life, which was from the beginning with
   the Father, appeared personally in human form. He came to communicate
   it to men. He is the bread of life from heaven, and feeds the believers
   everywhere spiritually without diminishing, as He fed the five thousand
   physically with five loaves. That miracle is continued in the mystical
   self-communication of Christ to his people. Whosoever believes in him
   has eternal life, which begins here in the new birth and will be
   completed in the resurrection of the body. [840]

   Herein also the Apocalypse well agrees with the Gospel and Epistles of
   John. Christ is represented as the victor of the devil. [841] He is the
   conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah, but also the suffering Lamb
   slain for us. The figure of the lamb, whether it be referred to the
   paschal lamb, or to the lamb in the Messianic passage of Isaiah 53:7,
   expresses the idea of atoning sacrifice which is fully realized in the
   death of Christ. He "washed" (or, according to another reading, he
   "loosed") "us from our sins by his blood;" he redeemed men "of every
   tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and made them to be unto our
   God a kingdom and priests." The countless multitude of the redeemed
   "washed their robes and made them white (bright and shining) in the
   blood of the Lamb." This implies both purification and sanctification;
   white garments being the symbols of holiness. [842] Love was the motive
   which prompted him to give his life for his people. [843] Great stress
   is laid on the resurrection, as in the Gospel, where he is called the
   Resurrection and the Life. The exalted Logos-Messiah has the keys of
   death and Hades. [844] He is a sharer in the universal government of
   God; he is the mediatorial ruler of the world, "the Prince of the kings
   of the earth" "King of kings and Lord of lords." [845] The apocalyptic
   seer likewise brings in the idea of life in its highest sense as a
   reward of faith in Christ to those who overcome and are faithful unto
   death, Christ will give "a crown of life," and a seat on his throne. He
   "shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life; and God shall wipe
   away every tear from their eyes." [846]

   IV. The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit (Pneumatology). This is most fully
   set forth in the farewell discourser, of our Lord, which are reported
   by John exclusively. The Spirit whom Christ promised to send after his
   return to the Father, is called the Paraclete, i.e., the Advocate or
   Counsellor, Helper, who pleads the cause of the believers, directs,
   supports, and comforts them. [847] He is "another Advocate" (allos
   parakletos), Christ himself being the first Advocate who intercedes for
   believers at the throne of the Father, as their eternal High priest.
   The Spirit proceeds (eternally) from the Father, and was sent by the
   Father and the Son on the day of Pentecost. [848] He reveals Christ to
   the heart and glorifies him (eme doxasei); he bears witness to him
   (marturesei peri emou); he calls to remembrance and explains his
   teaching (humas didaxei panta kai hupomnesei humas panta ha heipon
   humin ego); he leads the disciples into the whole truth (hodegesei
   humas eis ten aletheian pasan); he takes out of the fulness of Christ
   and shows it to them (ek tou emou lambanei kai anangelei humin). The
   Holy Spirit is the Mediator and Intercessor between Christ and the
   believer, as Christ is the Mediator between God and the world. He is
   the Spirit of truth and of holiness. He convicts (elenchei) the world,
   that is all men who come under his influnce, in respect of sin (peri
   hamartias), of righteousness, (dikaiosunes), and of judgment (kriseos);
   and this conviction will result either in the conversion, or in the
   impenitence of the sinner. The operation of the Spirit accompanies the
   preaching of the word, and always internal in the sphere of the heart
   and conscience. He is one of the three witnesses and gives efficacy to
   the other two witnesses of Christ on earth, the baptism (to hudor), and
   the atoning death (to haima) of Christ. [849]

   V. Christian Life. It begins with a new birth from above or from the
   Holy Spirit. Believers are children of God who are "born, not of blood,
   nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
   [850] It is a "new" birth compared with the old, a birth "from God," as
   compared with that from man, a birth from the Holy "Spirit," in
   distinction from carnal birth, a birth "from heaven," as opposed to
   earthly birth. The life of the believer does not descend through the
   channels of fallen nature, but requires a creative act of the Holy
   Spirit through the preaching of the gospel. The life of the regenerate
   is free from the principle and power of sin. "Whosoever is begotten of
   God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him; and he cannot sin
   because he is begotten of God." [851] Over him the devil has no power.
   [852]

   The new life is the life of Christ in the soul. It is eternal
   intrinsically and as to duration. Eternal life in man consists in the
   knowledge of the only true God and of Jesus Christ--a knowledge which
   implies full sympathy and communion of love. [853] It begins here in
   faith; hence the oft-repeated declaration that he who believes in
   Christ has (echei) eternal life. [854] But it will not appear in its
   full development till the time of his glorious manifestation, when we
   shall be like him and see him even as he is. [855] Faith is the medium
   of communication, the bond of union with Christ. Faith is the victory
   over the world, already here in principle. [856]

   John's idea of life eternal takes the place of Paul's idea of
   righteousness, but both agree in the high conception of faith as the
   one indispensable condition of securing it by uniting us to Christ, who
   is both righteousness and life eternal. [857]

   The life of the Christian, moreover, is a communion with Christ and
   with the Father in the Holy Spirit. Our Lord prayed before his passion
   that the believers of that and all future ages might be one with him,
   even as he is one with the Father, and that they may enjoy his glory.
   John writes his first Epistle for the purpose that his readers may have
   "fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, and that
   thus their joy may be made full." [858] This fellowship is only another
   word for love, and love to God is inseparable from love to the
   brethren. "If God so loved us, we also ought to love one another." "God
   is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God and God abideth in
   him." Love to the brethren is the true test of practical Christianity.
   [859] This brotherly fellowship is the true essence of the Church,
   which is nowhere even mentioned in John's Gospel and First Epistle.
   [860]

   Love to God and to the brethren is no mere sentiment, but an active
   power, and manifests itself in the keeping of God's commandments. [861]

   Here again John and Paul meet in the idea of love, as the highest of
   the Christian graces which abides forever when faith shall have passed
   into sight, and hope into fruition. [862]

   Notes.

   The incarnation is expressed by John briefly and tersely in the phrase
   "The Word became flesh" (John 1:14).

   I. The meaning of sarx. Apollinaris confined "flesh" to the body,
   including the animal soul, and taught that the Logos occupied the place
   of the rational soul or spirit (nous, pneuma) in Christ; that
   consequently he was not a full man, but a sort of middle being between
   God and man, half divine and haIf human, not wholly divine and wholly
   human. This view was condemned as heretical by the Nicene church, but
   renewed substantially by the Tübingen school, as being the doctrine of
   John. According to Baur (l.c., p. 363) sarx egenetois not equivalent to
   (anthropos egeneto, but means that the Logos assumed a human body and
   continued otherwise the same. The incarnation was only an incidental
   phenomenon in the unchanging personality of the Logos. Moreover the
   flesh of Christ was not like that of other men, but almost immaterial,
   so at; to be able to walk on the lake (John 6:16; Comp. 7:10, 15; 8:59
   10:39). To this exegesis we object:

   1. John expressly ascribes to Christ a soul, John 10:11, 15, 17; 12:27
   (he psuche mou tetaraktai), and a spirit, 11:33 (enebrimesato to
   pneumati); 13:21 (etarachthe to pneumati); 19:30 (paredoken to pneuma).
   It may be said that pneu'ma is here nothing more than the animal soul,
   because the same affection is attributed to both, and because it was
   surrendered in death. But Christ calls himself in John frequently "the
   Son of man" 1:51, etc.), and once "a man" (anthropos,8:40), which
   certainly must include the more important intellectual and spiritual
   part as well as the body.

   2. "Flesh" is often used in the Old and New Testament for the whole
   man, as in the phrase "all flesh" (pasa sarx, every mortal man), or mia
   sar'x(John 17:2; Rom. 3:20; 1 Cor. 1:29; Gal. 2:16). In this passage it
   suited John's idea better than anthropos,because it more strongly
   expresses the condescension of the Logos to the human nature in its
   present condition, with its weakness, trials, temptations, and
   sufferings. He completely identified himself with our earthly lot, and
   became homogeneous with us, even to the likeness, though not the
   essence, of sin (Rom. 8:3; comp. Heb. 2:14; 5:8, 9). "Flesh" then, when
   ascribed to Christ, has the same comprehensive meaning in John as it
   has in Paul (comp. also 1 Tim. 3:16). It is animated flesh, and the
   soul of that flesh contains the spiritual as well as the physical life.

   II. Another difficulty is presented by the verb egeneto. The champions
   of the modern Kenosis theory (Thomasius, Gess, Ebrard, Godet, etc.),
   while differing from the Apollinarian substitution of the Logos for a
   rational human soul in Christ, assert that the Logos himself because a
   human soul by voluntary transformation; and so they explain ejgevneto
   and the famous Pauline phrase heauton ekenosen, morphen doulou
   labon(Phil. 2:7). As the water was changed into wine at Cana (John 2:9:
   To hudor hoinon gegenemenon), so the Logos in infinite self-denial
   changed his divine being into a human being during the state of his
   humiliation, and thus led a single life, not a double life (as the
   Chalcedonian theory of two complete natures simultaneously coexisting
   in the same person from the manger to the cross seems to imply). But

   1. The verb egenetomust be understood in agreement with the parallel
   passages:, "he came in the flesh," 1 John 4:2 (en sarki eleluthota); 2
   John 7 (erchomenon en sarki), with this difference, that "became"
   indicates the realness of Christ's manhood, "came" the continuance of
   his godhood. Compare also Paul's expression, ephanerothe en sarki, 1
   Tim. 3:16.

   2. Whatever may be the objections to the Chalcedonian dyophysitism,
   they cannot be removed by running the Kenosis to the extent of a
   self-suspension of the Logos or an actual surrender of his essential
   attributes; for this is a metaphysical impossibility, and inconsistent
   with the unchangeableness of God and the intertrinitarian process. The
   Logos did not cease to be God when he entered into the human state of
   existence, nor did he cease to be man when he returned to the state of
   divine glory which he had with the Father before the foundation of the
   world.

   III. Beyschlag (Die Christologie des N. T, p. 168) denies the identity
   of the Logos with Christ, and resolves the Logos into a divine
   principle, instead of a person. "Der Logos ist nicht die Person Christi
   ... sondern er ist das gottheitliche Princip dieser menschlichen
   Persönlichkeit." He assumes a gradual unfolding of the Logos principle
   in the human person of Christ. But the personality of the Logos is
   taught in John 1:1-3, and egenetodenotes a completed act. We must
   remember, however, that personality in the trinity and personality of
   the Logos are different from personality of man. Human speech is
   inadequate to express the distinction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [815] John 1:17.

   [816] Herein Baur agrees with Neander and Schmid. He says of the
   Johannean type (l.c., p. 351): In ihm erreicht die neuteitamentliche
   Theologie ihre höchste Stufe und ihre vollendetste Form." This
   admission makes it all the more impossible to attribute the fourth
   Gospel to a literary forger of the second century. See also some
   excellent remarks of Weiss, pp. 605 sqq., and the concluding chapter of
   Reuss on Paul and John.

   [817] For the theology of the Apocalypse as compared with that of the
   Gospel and Epistles of John, see especially Gebhardt, The Doctrine of
   the Apoc., transl. by Jefferson, Edinb., 1878.

   [818] John 1:14 (etheasametha ten doxan autou); 1 John 1:1-3.

   [819] In the strictest sense of theologos as the chief champion of the
   eternal deity of the Logos: John 1:1:theos hen ho logos.So in the
   superscription of the Apocalypse in several cursive MSS.

   [820] John 17 3; 15:11; 16:24; 1 John 1:4.

   [821] Comp. John 1:14; 3:16; 1 John 4:1-3.

   [822] John 4:24; 1 John 1:5; 4:8, 16. The first definition or oracle is
   from Christ's dialogue with the woman of Samaria, who could, of course,
   not grasp the full meaning, but understood sufficiently its immediate
   practical application to the question of dispute between the Samaritans
   and the Jews concerning the worship on Gerizim or Jerusalem.

   [823] There is a remarkable variation of reading in John 1:18 between
   monogenes theos ,one who is God only-begotten, andho monogenes huios
   ,the only-begotten Son. (A third reading: ho monogenes theos ,"the
   only-begotten God," found in '' and 33, arose simply from a combination
   of the two readings, the article being improperly transferred from the
   second to the first.) The two readings are of equal antiquity; theos is
   supported by the oldest Greek MSS., nearly all Alexandrian or Egyptian
   ('* BC*L, also the Peshitto Syr.);huios by the oldest versions (Itala
   Vulg., Curet. Syr., also by the secondary uncials and all known
   cursives except 33). The usual abbreviations in the uncial MS., Tho-for
   theos and UO for huios ,may easily be confounded. The connection of
   monogenes withtheosis less natural than with huios although John
   undoubtedly could call the Son theos (not ho theos), and did so in 1:1.
   Monogenes theossimply combines the two attributes of the Logos, theos
   1:1, and monogenes, 1:14. For a learned and ingenious defence of theos
   see Hort's Dissertations (Cambridge, 1877), Westcott on St. John (p.
   71), and Westcott and Hort's Gr. Test. Introd. and Append., p. 74.
   Tischendorf and nearly all the German commentators (except Weiss) adopt
   huios, and Dr. Abbot, of Cambridge, Mass., has written two very able
   papers in favor of this reading, one in the Bibliotheca Sacra for 1861,
   pp. 840-872, and another in the " Unitarian Review" for June, 1875. The
   Westminster Revision first adopted " God" in the text, but afterwards
   put it on the margin. Both readings are intrinsically unobjectionable,
   and the sense is essentially the same. Monogenes does not necessarily
   convey the Nicene idea of eternal generation, but simply the unique
   character and superiority of the eternal and uncreated sonship of
   Christ over the sonship of believers which is a gift of grace. It shows
   his intimate relation to the Father, as the Pauline prototokos his
   sovereign relation to the world.

   [824] Lit."towards the bosom" (eis ton kolpon), i.e., leaning on, and
   moving to the bosom. It expresses the union of motion and rest and the
   closest and tenderest intimacy, as between mother and child, like the
   German term Schoosskind, bosom-child. Comp. pros ton theon John 1:1 and
   Prov. 8:30, where Wisdom (the Logos) says: "I was near Him as one
   brought up with Him, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always
   before him."

   [825] With this sentence the Prologue returns to the beginning and
   suggests the best reason why Christ is called Logos. He is the Exegete,
   the Expounder, the Interpreter of the hidden being, of God. "The word
   exegesato used by classical writers of the interpretation of divine
   mysteries. The absence of the object in the original is remarkable.
   Thus the literal rendering is simply, he made declaration (Vulg. ipse
   enarravit). Comp. Acts 15: 4. Westcott, in loc. See the classical
   parallels in Wetstein.

   [826] John 1:1, 14:1 John 1:1; Rev. 19:13. The Logos theory of John is
   the fruitful germ of the speculations of the Greek church on the
   mysteries of the incarnation and the trinity. See my ed. of Lange's
   Com. on John, pp. 51 and 55 sqq., where also the literature is given.
   On the latest discussions see Weiss in the sixth ed. of Meyer's Com. on
   John (1880), pp. 49 sqq. Logos means both ratio andoratio reason and
   speech, which are inseparably connected. " Logos," being masculine in
   Greek, is better fitted as a designation of Christ than our neuter "
   Word." Hence Ewald, in defiance of German grammar, renders it "der
   Wort."On the apocalyptic designation ho logos tou thuou and on the
   christology of the Apocalypse, see Gebhardt, l.c., 94 and 333 sqq. On
   Philo's idea of the Logos I refer to Schürer, Neutestam.
   Zeitgeschichte, pp. 648 sqq., and the works of Gfrörer, Zeller,
   Frankel, etc., there quoted.

   [827] These three ideas are contained in the first verse of the Gospel,
   which has stimulated and puzzled the profoundest minds from Origen and
   Augustin to Schelling and Goethe. Mark the unique union of transparent
   simplicity and inexhaustible depth, and the symmetry of the three
   clauses. The subject (logos) and the verb (hen) are three times
   repeated. " The three clauses contain all that it is possible for man
   to realize as to the essential nature of the Word in relation to time
   and mode of being and character: He was (1) in the beginning: He was
   (2) with God: He was (3) God. At the same time these three clauses
   answer to the three great moments of the Incarnation of the Word
   declared in John 1:14. He who 'was God,' became flesh: He who 'was with
   God,' tabernacled among us (comp. 1 John 1:2): He who 'was in the
   beginning,' became (in time)." Westcott (in Speaker's Com.). A similar
   interpretation is given by Lange. The personality of the Logos is
   denied by Beyschlag. See Notes (in text at end of § 72).

   [828] Here we have the germ (but the germ only) of the orthodox
   distinction between unity of essence and trinity of persons or
   hypostases; also of the distinction between an immanent, eternal
   trinity, and an economical trinity, which is revealed in time (in the
   works of creation, redemption, and sanctification). A Hebrew monotheist
   could not conceive of an eternal and independent being of a different
   essence (heteroousis) existing besides the one God. This would be
   dualism.

   [829] John 1:3, with a probable allusion to Gen. 1:3, "God said," as en
   arche refers to bereshith, Gen. 1:1. The negative repetition oude en,
   prorsus nihil, not even one thing (stronger than ouden nihil), excludes
   every form of dualism (against the Gnostics), and makes the panta
   absolutely unlimited. The Socinian interpretation, which confines it to
   the moral creation, is grammatically impossible.

   [830] John 1:14: ho logos sarx egeneto a sentence of immeasurable
   import, the leading idea not only of the Prologue, but of the Christian
   religion and of the history of mankind. It marks the close of the
   preparation for Christianity and the beginning of its introduction into
   the human race. Bengel calls attention to the threefold antithetic
   correspondence between 1:1 and 1:14: The Logos was (hen) in the
   beginning became (egeneto)
   God, flesh,
   with God. and dwelt among us.

   [831] Paul expresses the same idea: God sent his Son "in the likeness
   of the flesh of sin," Rom. 8:3; comp. Heb. 2:17; 4:15. See the note at
   the close of the section.

   [832] John 1:14: eskenosen en hemin, in allusion to the indwelling of
   Jehovah in the holy of holies of the tabernacle (skene) and the temple.
   The humanity of Christ is now the tabernacle of God, and the believers
   are the spectators of that glory. Comp. Rev. 7:15; 21:3

   tou kosmou.. The universality of the atonement could not be more
   clearly expressed; but there is a difference between universal
   sufficiency and universal efficiency.

   5:20: houtos estin ho alithinos theos kai zoe aionios , is of doubtful
   application. The natural connection of houtoswith the immediately
   preceding Iesou Christo, and the parallel passages where Christ is
   called " life," favor the reference to Christ; while the words ho
   alethinos theos suit better for the Father. See Braune, Huther, Ebrard,

   [847] John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7. Comp. also 1 John 2:1, where Christ
   is likewise called parakletos. He is our Advocate objectively at the
   throne of the Father, the Holy Spirit is our Advocate subjectively in
   our spiritual experience. The E. V. renders the word in all these
   passages, except the last, by " Comforter" (Consolator), which rests on
   a confusion of the passive parakletos with the active parakletor. See
   my notes in Lange's Com. on John, pp. 440 sqq., 468 sqq.

   [848] There is a distinction between the eternal procession
   (ekporeusis)of the Spirit from the Father (para tou Patros ekporeuetai,
   procedit, John 15:26), and the temporal mission (pempsis) of the Spirit
   from the Father and the Son (15:26, where Christ says of the Spirit:
   hon ego pempso, to, and 14:26, where he says: ho pempsei ho pater en to
   onomati mou). The Greek church to this day strongly insists on this
   distinction, and teaches an eternal procession of the Spirit from the
   Father alone, and a temporal mission of the Spirit by the Father and
   the Son. The difference between the present ekporeuetai and the future
   pempso seems to favor such a distinction, but the exclusive alone
   (monon) in regard to the procession is an addition of the Greek church
   as much as the Filioque is an addition of the Latin church to the
   original Nicene Creed. It is doubtful whether John meant to make a
   metaphysical distinction between procession and mission. But the
   distinction between the eternal trinity of the divine being and the
   temporal trinity of the divine revelation has an exegetical basis in
   the pre-existence of the Logos and the Spirit. The trinitarian
   revelation reflects the trinitarian essence; in other words, God
   reveals himself as he is, as Father, Son, and Spirit. We have a right
   to reason from the revelation of God to his nature, but with proper
   reverence and modesty; for who can exhaust the ocean of the Deity!

   [849] 1 John 5:8. There are different interpretations of water and
   blood: 1st, reference to the miraculous flow of blood and water from
   the wounded side of Christ, John 19:34; 2d, Christ's baptism, and
   Christ's atoning death; 3d, the two sacraments which he instituted as
   perpetual memorials. I would adopt the last view, if it were not for to
   aima, which nowhere designates the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and
   more naturally refers to the blood of Christ shed for the remission of
   sins. The passage on the three heavenly witnesses in 5:7, formerly
   quoted as a proof text for the doctrine of the trinity, is now
   generally given up as a mediaeval interpolation, and must be rejected
   on internal as well as external grounds; for John would never have
   written: "the Father, the Word, and the Spirit," but either "the
   Father, the Son, and the Spirit," or God, the Word (Logos), and the
   Spirit."

   [850] 2 John 1:13: tekna theou ... ek theou egennethesan. The classical
   section on the new birth is Christ's discourse with Nicodemus, 3:1-15.
   The terms gennethenai anothen, to be born anew, afresh, or from above,
   i. e., from heaven, Comp. 3:31; 19:11 (the reference is not to a
   repetition, again, a second time, palin, deuteron, but to an analogous
   process); 3: 6, 7; genethenai ex udatos -ikai-ipneumatos of water
   (baptism) and spirit, 3:5;ek theou, of God, ek tou ouranoufrom heaven,
   are equivalent. John himself most frequently uses ek theou, 1:13; 1
   John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18. He does not use anagennaomai , to be
   begotten or born again (but it occurs in Justin Martyr's quotation,
   Apol. I. 61; also in 1 Pet. 1:23, aagennemenoi ... dia logou zontos
   theou, and 1 Pet. 1:3, anagennesas hemas eis elpida), and the noun
   anagennesis, regeneration, is not found at all in the Greek Test.
   (though often in the Greek fathers); but the analogous palingenesia
   occurs once in connection with baptism, Tit. 3:5 (esosen hemas dai
   loutrou palingenesias kai anakainoseos pneumatos hagiou), and once in a
   more comprehensive sense of the final restitution and consummation of
   all things, Matt. 19:18. Paul speaks of the new creature in Christ
   (kaine ktisis , 2 Cor. 5:17) and of the new (kainos anthropos ,Eph.
   4:24). In the Rabbinical theology regeneration meant simply the change
   of the external status of a proselyte to Judaism.

   [851] 1 John 3:9; comp. 5:18. But 5:16 implies that a "brother" may
   sin, though not "unto death," and 1:10 also excludes the idea of
   absolute freedom from sin in the present state.

   of a local congregation. Of the external organization of the church
   John is silent; he does not even report the institution of the
   sacraments, though he speaks of the spiritual meaning of baptism (John
   3:5), and indirectly of the spiritual meaning of the Lord's Supper
   (6:53-56).

   § 73. Heretical Perversions of the Apostolic Teaching.

   (Comp. my Hist. of the Ap. Ch., pp. 649-674.)

   The three types of doctrine which we have briefly unfolded, exhibit
   Christianity in the whole fulness of its life; and they form the theme
   for the variations of the succeeding ages of the church. Christ is the
   key-note, harmonizing all the discords and resolving all the mysteries
   of the history of his kingdom.

   But this heavenly body of apostolic truth is confronted with the ghost
   of heresy; as were the divine miracles of Moses with the satanic
   juggleries of the Egyptians, and as Christ was with demoniacal
   possessions. The more mightily the spirit of truth rises, the more
   active becomes the spirit of falsehood. "Where God builds a church the
   devil builds, a chapel close by." But in the hands of Providence all
   errors must redound to the unfolding and the final victory of the
   truth. They stimulate inquiry and compel defence. Satan himself is that
   "power which constantly wills the bad, and works the good." Heresies in
   a disordered world are relatively necessary and negatively justifiable;
   though the teachers of them are, of course, not the less guilty. "It
   must needs be, that scandals come; but woe to that man by whom the
   scandal cometh." [863]

   The heresies of the apostolic age are, respectively, the caricatures of
   the several types of the true doctrine. Accordingly we distinguish
   three fundamental forms of heresy, which reappear, with various
   modifications, in almost every subsequent period. In this respect, as
   in others, the apostolic period stands as the type of the whole future;
   and the exhortations and warnings of the New Testament against false
   doctrine have force for every age.

   1. The Judaizing tendency is the heretical counterpart of Jewish
   Christianity. It so insists on the unity of Christianity with Judaism,
   as to sink the former to the level of the latter, and to make the
   gospel no more than an improvement or a perfected law. It regards
   Christ as a mere prophet, a second Moses; and denies, or at least
   wholly overlooks, his divine nature and his priestly and kingly
   offices. The Judaizers were Jews in fact, and Christians only in
   appearance and in name. They held circumcision and the whole moral and
   ceremonial law of Moses to be still binding, and the observance of them
   necessary to salvation. Of Christianity as a new, free, and universal
   religion, they had no conception. Hence they hated Paul, the liberal
   apostle of the Gentiles, as a dangerous apostate and revolutionist,
   impugned his motives, and everywhere, especially in Galatia and
   Corinth, labored to undermine his authority in the churches. The
   epistles of Paul, especially that to the Galatians, can never be
   properly understood, unless their opposition to this false Judaizing
   Christianity be continually kept in view.

   The same heresy, more fully developed, appears in the second century
   under the name of Ebionism.

   2. The opposite extreme is a false Gentile Christianity, which may be
   called the Paganizing or Gnostic heresy. It is as radical and
   revolutionary as the other is contracted and reactionary. It violently
   breaks away from the past, while the Judaizing heresies tenaciously and
   stubbornly cling to it as permanently binding. It exaggerates the
   Pauline view of the distinction of Christianity from Judaism, sunders
   Christianity from its historical basis, resolves the real humanity of
   the Saviour into a Doketistic illusion, and perverts the freedom of the
   gospel into antinomian licentiousness. The author, or first
   representative of this baptized heathenism, according to the uniform
   testimony of Christian antiquity, is Simon Magus, who unquestionably
   adulterated Christianity with pagan ideas and practices, and gave
   himself out, in pantheistic style, for an emanation of God. [864] Plain
   traces of this error appear in the later epistles of Paul (to the
   Colossians, to Timothy, and to Titus), the second epistle of Peter, the
   first two epistles of John, the epistle of Jude, and the messages of
   the Apocalypse to the seven churches.

   This heresy, in the second century, spread over the whole church, east
   and west, in the various schools of Gnosticism.

   3. As attempts had already been made, before Christ, by Philo, by the
   Therapeutae and the Essenes, etc., to blend the Jewish religion with
   heathen philosophy, especially that of Pythagoras and Plato, so now,
   under the Christian name, there appeared confused combinations of these
   opposite systems, forming either a Paganizing Judaism, i.e., Gnostic
   Ebionism, or a Judaizing Paganism i.e., Ebionistic Gnosticism,
   according as the Jewish or the heathen element prevailed. This
   Syncretistic heresy was the caricature of John's theology, which truly
   reconciled Jewish and Gentile Christianity in the highest conception of
   the person and work of Christ. The errors combated in the later books
   of the New Testament are almost all more or less of this mixed sort,
   and it is often doubtful whether they come from Judaism or from
   heathenism. They were usually shrouded in a shadowy mysticism and
   surrounded by the halo of a self-made ascetic holiness, but sometimes
   degenerated into the opposite extreme of antinomian licentiousness.

   Whatever their differences, however, all these three fundamental
   heresies amount at last to a more or less distinct denial of the
   central truth of the gospel--the incarnation of the Son of God for the
   salvation of the world. They make Christ either a mere man, or a mere
   superhuman phantom; they allow, at all events, no real and abiding
   union of the divine and human in the person of the Redeemer. This is
   just what John gives as the mark of antichrist, which existed even in
   his day in various forms. [865] It plainly undermines the foundation of
   the church. For if Christ be not God-man, neither is he mediator
   between God and men; Christianity sinks back into heathenism or
   Judaism. All turns at last on the answer to that fundamental question:
   "What think ye of Christ?" The true solution of this question is the
   radical refutation of every error.

   Notes.

   "It has often been remarked that truths and error keep pace with each
   other. Error is the shadow cast by truth, truth the bright side brought
   out by error. Such is the relation between the heresies and the
   apostolical teaching of the first century. The Gospels indeed, as in
   other respects, so in this, rise almost entirely above the
   circumstances of the time, but the Epistles are, humanly speaking, the
   result of the very conflict between the good and the evil elements
   which existed together in the bosom of the early Christian society. As
   they exhibit the principles afterward to be unfolded into all truth and
   goodness, so the heresies which they attack exhibit the principles
   which were afterward to grow up into all the various forms of error,
   falsehood and wickedness. The energy, the freshness, nay, even the
   preternatural power which belonged to the one belonged also to the
   other. Neither the truths in the writings of the Apostles, nor the
   errors in the opinions of their opponents, can be said to exhibit the
   dogmatical form of any subsequent age. It is a higher and more
   universal good which is aimed at in the former; it is a deeper and more
   universal principle of evil which is attacked in the latter. Christ
   Himself, and no subordinate truths or speculations concerning Him, is
   reflected in the one; Antichrist, and not any of the particular outward
   manifestations of error which have since appeared, was justly regarded
   by the Apostles as foreshadowed in the other." -- Dean Stanley
   (Apostolic Age, p. 182).

   Literature.--The heresies of the Apostolic Age have been thoroughly
   investigated by Neander and Baur in connection with the history of
   Ebionism and Gnosticism (see next vol.), and separately in the
   introductions to critical commentaries on the Colossians and Pastoral
   Epistles; also by Thiersch, Lipsius, Hilgenfeld. Among English writers
   we mention Burton: Inquiry into the Heresies of the Apostolic Age, in

   restored the cleanest text from the oldest attainable sources; all
   substantially agree in principle and result, and give us the ancient
   uncial instead of the mediaeval cursive text.

   Two bilingual editions also deserve special mention in connection with
   the recent revision of Luther's and King James's versions. Oskar von
   Gebhardt, Novum Testamentum Graece et Germanice, Lips., 1881, gives the
   last text of Tischendorf (with the readings of Tregelles, and Westcott
   and Hort below) and the revised translation of Luther. His Greek text
   is also separately issued with an "Adnotatio critica," not contained in
   the diglott edition. The Greek-English New Testament, containing

   § 75. Rise of the Apostolic Literature.

   Christ is the book of life to be read by all. His religion is not an
   outward letter of command, like the law of Moses, but free, quickening
   spirit; not a literary production, but a moral creation; not a new
   system of theology or philosophy for the learned, but a communication
   of the divine life for the redemption of the whole world. Christ is the
   personal Word of God, the eternal Logos, who became flesh and dwelt
   upon earth as the true Shekinah, in the veiled glory of the only
   begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. He spoke; and all
   the words of his mouth were, and still are, spirit and life. The human
   heart craves not a learned, letter-writing, literary Christ, but a
   wonder-working, cross-bearing, atoning Redeemer, risen, enthroned in
   heaven, and ruling the world; furnishing, at the same time, to men and
   angels an unending theme for meditation, discourse, and praise.

   So, too, the Lord chose none of his apostles, with the single exception
   of Paul, from the ranks of the learned; he did not train them to
   literary authorship, nor give them, throughout his earthly life, a
   single express command to labor in that way. Plain fishermen of
   Galilee, unskilled in the wisdom of this world, but filled with the
   Holy Spirit of truth and the powers of the world to come, were
   commissioned to preach the glad tidings of salvation to all nations in
   the strength and in the name of their glorified Master, who sits on the
   right hand of God the Father Almighty, and has promised to be with them
   to the end of time.

   The gospel, accordingly, was first propagated and the church founded by
   the personal oral teaching and exhortation, the "preaching,"
   "testimony," "word," "tradition," of the apostles and their disciples;
   as, in fact, to this day the living word is the indispensable or, at
   least, the principal means of promoting the Christian religion. Nearly
   all the books of the New Testament were written between the years 50
   and 70, at least twenty years after the resurrection of Christ, and the
   founding of the church; and the Gospel and Epistles of John still
   later.

   As the apostles' field of labor expanded, it became too large for their
   personal attention, and required epistolary correspondence. The vital
   interests of Christianity and the wants of coming generations demanded
   a faithful record of the life and teaching of Christ by perfectly
   reliable witnesses. For oral tradition, among fallible men, is liable
   to so many accidental changes, that it loses in certainty and
   credibility as its distance from the fountain-head increases, till at
   last it can no longer be clearly distinguished from the additions and
   corruptions collected upon it. There was great danger, too, of a wilful
   distortion of the history and doctrine of Christianity by Judaizing and
   paganizing errorists, who had already raised their heads during the
   lifetime of the apostles. An authentic written record of the words and
   acts of Jesus and his disciples was therefore absolutely indispensable,
   not indeed to originate the church, but to keep it from corruption and
   to furnish it with a pure standard of faith and discipline.

   Hence seven and twenty books by apostles and apostolic men, written
   under the special influence and direction of the Holy Spirit. These
   afford us a truthful picture of the history, the faiths, and the
   practice of primitive Christianity, "for teaching, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness." [866]

   The collection of these writings into a canon, in distinction both from
   apocryphal or pseudo-apostolic works, and from orthodox yet merely
   human productions, was the work of the early church; and in performing
   it she was likewise guided by the Spirit of God and by a sound sense of
   truth. It was not finished to the satisfaction of all till the end of
   the fourth century, down to which time seven New Testament books (the
   "Antilegomena" of Eusebius), the second Epistle of Peter, the second
   and third Epistles of John, the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, the
   Epistles of James and Jude, and in a certain sense also the Apocalypse
   of John, were by some considered of doubtful authorship or value. But
   the collection was no doubt begun, on the model of the Old Testament
   canon, in the first century; [867] and the principal books, the
   Gospels, the Acts, the thirteen Epistles of Paul, the first Epistle of
   Peter, and the first of John, in a body, were in general use after the
   middle of the second century, and were read, either entire or by
   sections, in public worship, after the manner of the Jewish synagogue,
   for the edification of the people.

   The external testimony of tradition alone cannot (for the Protestant
   Christian) decide the apostolic origin and canonical character of a
   book; it must be confirmed by the internal testimony of the book
   itself. But this is not wanting, and the general voice of Christendom
   for these eighteen hundred years has recognized in the little volume,
   which we call the New Testament, a book altogether unique in spiritual
   power and influence over the mind and heart of man, and of more
   interest and value than all the ancient and modern classics combined.
   If ever God spoke and still speaks to man, it is in this book.

   § 76. Character of the New Testament.

   In these inspired writings we have, not indeed an equivalent, but a
   reliable substitute for the personal presence and the oral instruction
   of Christ and his apostles. The written word differs from the spoken
   only in form; the substance is the same, and has therefore the same
   authority and quickening power for us as it had for those who heard it
   first. Although these books were called forth apparently by special and
   accidental occasions, and were primarily addressed to particular
   circles of readers and adapted to peculiar circumstances, yet, as they
   present the eternal and unchangeable truth in living forms, they suit
   all circumstances and conditions. Tracts for the times, they are tracts
   for all times; intended for Jews and Greeks of the first century, they
   have the same interest for Englishmen and Americans of the nineteenth
   century. They are to this day not only the sole reliable and pure
   fountain of primitive Christianity, but also the infallible rule of
   Christian faith and practice. From this fountain the church has drunk
   the water of life for more than fifty generations, and will drink it
   till the end of time. In this rule she has a perpetual corrective for
   an her faults, and a protective against all error. Theological systems
   come and go, and draw from that treasury their larger or smaller
   additions to the stock of our knowledge of the truth; but they can
   never equal that infallible word of God, which abideth forever.


   "Our little systems have their day,

   They have their day and cease to be:

   They are but broken lights of Thee,

   And Thou, O God, art more than they."

   The New Testament evinces its universal design in its very, style,
   which alone distinguishes it from all the literary productions of
   earlier and later times. It has a Greek body, a Hebrew soul, and a
   Christian spirit which rules both. The language is the Hellenistic
   idiom; that is, the Macedonian Greek as spoken by the Jews of the
   dispersion in the time of Christ; uniting, in a regenerated Christian
   form, the two great antagonistic nationalities and religions of the
   ancient world. The most beautiful language of heathendom and the
   venerable language of the Hebrews are here combined, and baptized with
   the spirit of Christianity, and made the picture of silver for the
   golden apple of the eternal truth of the gospel. The style of the Bible
   in general is singularly adapted to men of every class and grade of
   culture, affording the child the simple nourishment for its religious
   wants, and the profoundest thinker inexhaustible matter of study. The
   Bible is not simply a popular book, but a book of all nations, and for
   all societies, classes, and conditions of men. It is more than a book,
   it is an institution which rules the Christian world.

   The New Testament presents, in its way, the same union of the divine
   and human as the person of Christ. In this sense also "the word became
   flesh, and dwells among us." As Christ was like us in body, soul, and
   spirit, sin only excepted, so the Scriptures, which "bear witness of
   him," are thoroughly human (though without doctrinal and ethical error)
   in contents and form, in the mode of their rise, their compilation,
   their preservation, and transmission; yet at the same time they are
   thoroughly divine both in thoughts and words, in origin, vitality,
   energy, and effect, and beneath the human servant-form of the letter,
   the eye of faith discerns the glory of "the only begotten from the
   Father, full of grace and truth."

   The apostolic writings are of three kinds: historical, didactic, and
   prophetic. To the first class belong the Gospels and Acts; to the
   second, the Epistles; to the third, the Revelation. They are related to
   each other as regeneration, sanctification, and glorification; as
   foundation, house, and dome. Jesus Christ is the beginning, the middle,
   and the end of all. In the Gospels he walks in human form upon the
   earth, and accomplishes the work of redemption. In the Acts and
   Epistles he founds the church, and fills and guides it by his Spirit.
   And at last, in the visions of the Apocalypse, he comes again in glory,
   and with his bride, the church of the saints, reigns forever upon the
   new earth in the city of God.

   This order corresponds with the natural progress of the Christian
   revelation and was universally adopted by the church, with the
   exception of a difference in the arrangement of the Epistles. The New
   Testament was not given in the form of a finished volume, but the
   several books grew together by recognition and use according to the law
   of internal fitness. Most of the ancient Manuscripts, Versions, and
   Catalogues arrange the books in the following order: Gospels, Acts,
   Catholic Epistles, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse. [868] Some put the
   Pauline Epistles before the Catholic Epistles. [869] Our English Bible
   follows the order of the Latin Vulgate. [870]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [868] This order is restored in the critical editions of Lachmann,
   Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort.

   [869] The Codex Sinaiticus puts the Pauline Epistles before the Acts,
   and the Hebrews between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy.

   [870] This order agrees with the Muratorian Fragment, the catalogue of
   Eusebius (H. E., III. 25), that of the Synod of Carthage (a.d. 897),
   and the Codex Basiliensis. Luther took the liberty of disconnecting the
   Hebrews (which he ascribed to Apollos) from the Pauline Epistles, and
   putting it and the Epistle of James (which be disliked) at the end of
   the Catholic Epistles (except Jude)

   § 78. The Four Gospels.

   General Character and Aim of the Gospels.

   Christianity is a cheerful religion and brings joy and peace from
   heaven to earth. The New Testament opens with the gospel, that is with
   the authentic record of the history of all histories, the glad tidings
   of salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
   [871] The four canonical Gospels are only variations of the same theme,
   a fourfold representation of one and the same gospel, animated by the
   same spirit. [872] They are not full biographies, [873] but only
   memoirs or a selection of characteristic features of Christ's life and
   work as they struck each Evangelist and best suited his purpose and his
   class of readers. [874] They are not photographs which give only the
   momentary image in a single attitude, but living pictures from repeated
   sittings, and reproduce the varied expressions and aspects of Christ's
   person.

   The style is natural, unadorned, straightforward, and objective. Their
   artless and naïve simplicity resembles the earliest historic records in
   the Old Testament, and has its peculiar and abiding charm for all
   classes of people and all degrees of culture. The authors, in noble
   modesty and self-forgetfulness, suppress their personal views and
   feelings, retire in worshipful silence before their great subject, and
   strive to set it forth in all its own unaided power.

   The first and fourth Gospels were composed by apostles and
   eye-witnesses, Matthew and John; the second and third, under the
   influence of Peter and Paul, and by their disciples Mark and Luke, so
   as to be indirectly likewise of apostolic origin and canonical
   authority. Hence Mark is often called the Gospel of Peter, and Luke the
   Gospel of Paul.

   The common practical aim of the Evangelists is to lead the reader to a
   saving faith in Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah and Redeemer
   of the world. [875]

   Common Origin.

   The Gospels have their common source in the personal intercourse of two
   of the writers with Christ, and in the oral tradition of the apostles
   and other eye-witnesses. Plain fishermen of Galilee could not have
   drawn such a portrait of Jesus if he had not sat for it. It would take
   more than a Jesus to invent a Jesus. They did not create the divine
   original, but they faithfully preserved and reproduced it.

   The gospel story, being constantly repeated in public preaching and in
   private circles, assumed a fixed, stereotyped form; the more readily,
   on account of the reverence of the first disciples for every word of
   their divine Master. Hence the striking agreement of the first three,
   or synoptical Gospels, which, in matter and form, are only variations
   of the same theme. Luke used, according to his own statement, besides
   the oral tradition, written documents on certain parts of the life of
   Jesus, which doubtless appeared early among the first disciples. The
   Gospel of Mark, the confidant of Peter, is a faithful copy of the
   gospel preached and otherwise communicated by this apostle; with the
   use, perhaps, of Hebrew records which Peter may have made from time to
   time under the fresh impression of the events themselves.

   Individual Characteristics.

   But with all their similarity in matter and style, each of the Gospels,
   above all the fourth, has its peculiarities, answering to the personal
   character of its author, his special design, and the circumstances of
   his readers. The several evangelists present the infinite fulness of
   the life and person of Jesus in different aspects and different
   relations to mankind; and they complete one another. The symbolical
   poesy of the church compares them with the four rivers of Paradise, and
   with the four cherubic representatives of the creation, assigning the
   man to Matthew, the lion to Mark, the ox to Luke, and the eagle to
   John.

   The apparent contradictions of these narratives, when closely examined,
   sufficiently solve themselves, in all essential points, and serve only
   to attest the honesty, impartiality, and credibility of the authors. At
   the same time the striking combination of resemblances and differences
   stimulates close observation and minute comparison, and thus impresses
   the events of the life of Christ more vividly and deeply upon the mind
   and heart of the reader than a single narrative could do. The immense
   labor of late years in bringing out the comparative characteristics of
   the Gospels and in harmonizing their discrepancies has not been in
   vain, and has left a stronger conviction of their independent worth and
   mutual completeness.

   Matthew wrote for Jews, Mark for Romans, Luke for Greeks, John for
   advanced Christians; but all are suited for Christians in every age and
   nation. [876] The first Gospel exhibits Jesus of Nazareth as the
   Messiah and Lawgiver of the kingdom of heaven who challenges our
   obedience; the second Gospel as the mighty conqueror and worker of
   miracles who excites our astonishment; the third Gospel as the
   sympathizing Friend and Saviour of men who commands our confidence; the
   fourth Gospel as the eternal Son of God who became flesh for our
   salvation and claims our adoration and worship, that by believing in
   him we may have eternal life. The presiding mind which planned this
   fourfold gospel and employed the agents without a formal agreement and
   in conformity to their talents, tastes, and spheres of usefulness, is
   the Spirit of that Lord who is both the Son of Man and the Son of God,
   the Saviour of us all.

   Time Of Composition.

   As to the time of composition, external testimony and internal evidence
   which modern critical speculations have not been able to invalidate,
   point to the seventh decade of the first century for the Synoptic
   Gospels, and to the ninth decade for the Gospel of John.

   The Synoptic Gospels were certainly written before a.d. 70; for they
   describe the destruction of Jerusalem as an event still future, though
   nigh at hand, and connect it immediately with the glorious appearing of
   our Lord, which it was thought might take place within the generation
   then living, although no precise date is fixed anywhere, the Lord
   himself declaring it to be unknown even to him. Had the Evangelists
   written after that terrible catastrophe, they would naturally have made
   some allusion to it, or so arranged the eschatological discourses of
   our Lord (Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21) as to enable the reader clearly
   to discriminate between the judgment of Jerusalem and the final
   judgment of the world, as typically foreshadowed by the former. [877]

   On the other hand, a considerable number of years must have elapsed
   after the resurrection. This is indicated by the fact that several
   imperfect attempts at a gospel history had previously been made (Luke
   1:1), and by such a phrase as: "until this day" (Matt. 27:8; 28:15).

   But it is quite impossible to fix the precise year of composition. The
   silence of the Epistles is no conclusive argument that the Synoptists
   wrote after the death of James, Peter, and Paul; for there is the same
   silence in the Acts concerning the Epistles of Paul, and in the
   Epistles concerning the Acts. The apostles did not quote each other's
   writings. the only exception is the reference of Peter to the Epistles
   of Paul. In the multiplicity of their labors the Evangelists may have
   been engaged for several years in preparing their works until they
   assumed their present shape. The composition of a life of Christ now
   may well employ many years of the profoundest study.

   The Hebrew Matthew was probably composed first; then Mark; the Greek
   Matthew and Luke cannot be far apart. If the Acts, which suddenly break
   off with Paul's imprisonment in Rome (61-63), were written before the
   death of the apostle, the third Gospel, which is referred to as "the
   first treatise" (Acts 1:1), must have been composed before a.d. 65 or
   64, perhaps, in Caesarea, where Luke had the best opportunity to gather
   his material during Paul's imprisonment between 58 and 60; but it was
   probably not published till a few years afterwards. Whether the later
   Synoptists knew and used the earlier will be discussed in the next
   section.

   John, according to the universal testimony of antiquity, which is
   confirmed by internal evidence, wrote his Gospel last, after the fall
   of Jerusalem and after the final separation of the Christians from the
   Jews. He evidently presupposes the Synoptic Gospels (although he never
   refers to them), and omits the eschatological and many other discourses
   and miracles, even the institution of the sacraments, because they were
   already sufficiently known throughout the church. But in this case too
   it is impossible to fix the year of composition. John carried his
   Gospel in his heart and memory for many years and gradually reduced it
   to writing in his old age, between a.d. 80 and 100; for he lived to the
   close of the first century and, perhaps, saw the dawn of the second.

   Credibility.

   The Gospels make upon every unsophisticated reader the impression of
   absolute honesty. They tell the story without rhetorical embellishment,
   without any exclamation of surprise or admiration, without note and
   comment. They frankly record the weaknesses and failings of the
   disciples, including themselves, the rebukes which their Master
   administered to them for their carnal misunderstandings and want of
   faith, their cowardice and desertion in the most trying hour, their
   utter despondency after the crucifixion, the ambitious request of John
   and James, the denial of Peter, the treason of Judas. They dwell even
   with circumstantial minuteness upon the great sin of the leader of the
   Twelve, especially the Gospel of Mark, who derived his details no doubt
   from Peter's own lips. They conceal nothing, they apologize for
   nothing, they exaggerate nothing. Their authors are utterly unconcerned
   about their own fame, and withhold their own name; their sole object is
   to tell the story of Jesus, which carries its own irresistible force
   and charm to the heart of every truth-loving reader. The very
   discrepancies in minor details increase confidence and exclude the
   suspicion of collusion; for it is a generally acknowledged principle in
   legal evidence that circumstantial variation in the testimony of
   witnesses confirms their substantial agreement. There is no historical
   work of ancient times which carries on its very face such a seal of
   truthfulness as these Gospels.

   The credibility of the canonical Gospels receives also negative
   confirmation from the numerous apocryphal Gospels which by their
   immeasurable inferiority and childishness prove the utter inability of
   the human imagination, whether orthodox or heterodox, to produce such a
   character as the historical Jesus of Nazareth.

   No post-apostolic writers could have composed the canonical Gospels,
   and the apostles themselves could not have composed them without the
   inspiration of the spirit of Christ.

   Notes.

   1. The Symbolism of the Gospels. This belongs to the history of
   Christian poetry and art, but also to the history of exegesis, and may
   be briefly mentioned here. It presents the limited recognition of the
   individuality of the Gospels among the fathers and throughout the
   middle ages.

   The symbolic attributes of the Evangelists were suggested by Ezekiel's
   vision of the four cherubim which represent the creation and carry the
   throne of God (Ez. 1:15 sqq.; 10:1 sqq.; 11:22), and by the four
   "living creatures" (zoa, nottheria, "beasts," with which the E. V.
   confounds them) in the Apocalypse (Rev. 4:6-9; 5:6, 8, 11, 14; 6:1, 3,
   5, 6, 7; 7:11; 14:3; 15:7; 19:4).

   (1.) The theological use. The cherubic figures which the prophet saw in
   his exile on the banks of the Chebar, symbolize the divine attributes
   of majesty and strength reflected in the animal creation; and the
   winged bulls and lions and the eagle-beaded men of Assyrian monuments
   have a similar significance. But the cherubim were interpreted as
   prophetic types of the four Gospels as early as the second century,
   with some difference in the application.

   Irenaeus (about 170) regards the faces of the cherubim (man, lion, ox,
   eagle) as "images of the life and work of the Son of God," and assigns
   the man to Matthew, and the ox to Luke, but the eagle to Mark and the
   lion to John (Adv. Haer., III. 11, 8, ed. Stieren I. 469 sq.).
   Afterwards the signs of Mark and John were properly exchanged. So by
   Jerome (d. 419) in his Com. on Ezekiel and other passages. I quote from
   the Prologus to his Comment. in Ev. Matthaei (Opera, vol. VII., p. 19,
   ed. Migne): "Haec igitur quatuor Evangelia multo ante praedicta,
   Ezechielis quoque volumen probat, in quo prima visio ita contexitur:
   'Et in medio sicut similitudo quatuor animalium: et vultus eorum facies
   hominis, et facies leonis, et facies vituli, et facies aquilae' (Ezech.
   1:5 et 10). Prima hominis facies Matthaeum significat, qui quasi de
   homine exorsus est scribere: 'Liber generationis Jesu Christi, filii
   David, filii Abraham' (Matth. 1). Secunda, Marcum, in quo [al. qua] vox
   leonis in eremo rugientis auditur: 'Vox clamantis in deserto [al.
   eremo], Parate viam Domini, rectas facile semitas ejus' (Marc. 1:3).
   Tertia, vituli, quae evangelistam Lucam a Zacharia sacerdote sumpsisse
   initium praefigurat. Quarta, Joannem evangelistam, qui assumptis pennis
   aquilae, et ad altiora festinans, de Verbo Dei disputat.

   Augustin (De Consens. Evang., Lib. I., c. 6, in Migne's ed. of the
   Opera, tom. III., 1046) assigns the lion to Matthew, the man to Mark
   (whom he wrongly regarded as an abbreviator of Matthew), the ox to
   Luke, and the eagle to John, because "he soars as an eagle above the
   clouds of human infirmity, and gazes on the light of immutable truth
   with most keen and steady eyes of the heart." In another place (Tract.
   XXXVI. in Joh. Ev., c. 8, § 1) Augustin says: "The other three
   Evangelists walked as it were on earth with our Lord as man (tamquam
   cum homine Domino in terra ambulabant) and said but little of his
   divinity. But John, as if he found it oppressive to walk on earth,
   opened his treatise, so to speak, with a peal of thunder .... To the
   sublimity of this beginning all the rest corresponds, and he speaks of
   our Lord's divinity as no other." He calls the evangelic quaternion
   "the fourfold car of the Lord, upon which he rides throughout the world
   and subdues the nations to his easy yoke." Pseudo-Athanasius (Synopsis
   Script.) assigns the man to Matthew, the ox to Mark, the lion to Luke.
   These variations in the application of the emblems reveal the defects
   of the analogy. The man might as well (with Lange) be assigned to
   Luke's Gospel of humanity as the sacrificial ox. But Jerome's
   distribution of the symbols prevailed and was represented in poetry by
   Sedulius in the fifth century.

   Among recent divines, Bishop Wordsworth, of Lincoln, who is in full
   sympathy with the fathers and all their pious exegetical fancies, has
   thus eloquently reproduced the cherubic symbolism (in his Com. on The
   New Test., vol. I., p. xli): "The Christian church, looking at the
   origin of the Four Gospels, and the attributes which God has in rich
   measure been pleased to bestow upon them by his Holy Spirit, found a
   prophetic picture of them in the four living cherubim, named from
   heavenly knowledge, seen by the prophet Ezekiel at the river of Chebar.
   Like them the Gospels are four in number; like them they are the
   chariot of God, who sitteth between the cherubim; like them they bear
   him on a winged throne into all lands; like them they move wherever the
   Spirit guides them; like them they are marvellously joined together,
   intertwined with coincidences and differences: wing interwoven with
   wing, and wheel interwoven with wheel; like them they are full of eyes,
   and sparkle with heavenly light; like them they sweep from heaven to
   earth, and from earth to heaven, and fly with lightning's speed and
   with the noise of many waters. Their sound is gone out into all lands,
   and the words to the end of the world." Among German divines, Dr. Lange
   is the most ingenious expounder of this symbolism, but he exchanges the
   symbols of Matthew and Luke. See his Leben Jesu, I., 156 sqq., and his
   Bibelkunde (1881), p. 176.

   (2.) The pictorial representations of the four Evangelists, from the
   rude beginnings in the catacombs and the mosaics of the basilicas at
   Rome and Ravenna to modern times, have been well described by Mrs.
   Jameson, Sacred and Legendary Art, vol. I, 132-175 (Boston ed., 1865).
   She distinguishes seven steps in the progress of Christian art: 1st,
   the mere fact, the four scrolls, or books of the Evangelists; 2d, the
   idea, the four rivers of salvation flowing from on high to fertilize
   the whole earth; 3d, the prophetic symbol, the winged cherub of
   fourfold aspect; 4th, the Christian symbol, the four "beasts" (better,
   "living creatures") in the Apocalypse, with or without the angel-wings;
   5th, the combination of the emblematical animal with the human form;
   6th, the human personages, each of venerable or inspired aspect, as
   becomes the teacher and witness, and each attended by the scriptural
   emblem--no longer an emblem, but an attribute--marking his individual
   vocation and character; 7th, the human being only, holding his Gospel,
   i.e., his version of the teaching and example of Christ.

   (3.) Religious poetry gives expression to the same idea. We find it in
   Juvencus and Sedulius, and in its perfection in Adam of St. Victor, the
   greatest Latin poet of the middle ages (about 1172). He made the
   Evangelists the subject of two musical poems: "Plausu chorus
   laetabundo," and "Jocundare plebs fidelis." Both are found in Gautier's
   edition (1858), and with a good English translation by Digby S.
   Wrangham in The Liturgical Poetry of Adam of St. Victor, London, 1881,
   vol, II., pp. 156-169. The first has been well reproduced in English by
   Dr. Plumptre (in his Com. on the Synoptists, in Ellicott's series, but
   with the omission of the first three stanzas). I will quote the third
   stanza of the first (with Wrangham's version):

   "

   Circa thema generale,

   Habet quisque speciale

   Styli privilegium:

   Quod praesignat in propheta

   Forma pictus sub discreta

   Vultus animalium."

   "Though one set of facts is statted,

   They by each one are related

   In a manner all his own:

   This the prophet by four creatures,

   Each of different form and features,

   Pictures for us, one by one."

   In the second poem the following stanzas are the best:

   Formam viri dant Matthaeo,

   Quia scripsit sic de Deo,

   Sicut descendit ab eo,

   Quem plasmavit, homine.

   Lucas bos est in figura

   Ut praemonstrat in Scriptura,

   Hostiarum tangens jura

   Legis sub velamine.

   Matthew as the man is treated,

   Since 'tis he, who hath related,

   How from man, by God created,

   God did, as a man, descend.

   Luke the ox's semmblance weareth,

   Since his Gospel first declareth,

   As he thence the Law's veil teareth,

   Sacrifice' aim and end.


   Marcus, lleo per desertum

   Clamans, rugit in apertum:

   Iter fiat Deo certum,

   Mundum cor a crimine.

   Sed Johannes, ala bina

   Charitatis, aquilina

   Forma, fetur in divinaa

   Puriori lumine.


   Mark, the lion, his voice upraises,

   Crying out in desert places:

   "Cleanse your hearts from all sin's traces,

   At a holier love's full fount!

   May the doctrine they provide us

   Draw us from sin's slough beside us,

   An to things divine thus guide us,

   As from earth we upward mount!

   II. The Credibility of the Gospels would never have been denied if it
   were not for the philosophical and dogmatic skepticism which desires to
   get rid of the supernatural and miraculous at any price. It impresses
   itself upon men of the highest culture as well as upon the unlearned
   reader. The striking testimony of Rousseau is well known and need not
   be repeated. I will quote only from two great writers who were by no
   means biased in favor of orthodoxy. Dr. W. E. Channing, the
   distinguished leader of American Unitarianism, says (with reference to
   the Strauss and Parker skepticism): "I know no histories to be compared
   with the Gospels in marks of truth, in pregnancy of meaning, in
   quickening power." ... "As to his [Christ's] biographers, they speak
   for themselves. Never were more simple and honest ones. They show us
   that none in connection with Christ would give any aid to his
   conception, for they do not receive it .... The Gospels are to me their
   own evidence. They are the simple records of a being who could not have
   been invented, and the miraculous and more common parts of his life so
   hang together, are so permeated by the same spirit, are so plainly
   outgoings of one and the same man, that I see not how we can admit one
   without the other." See Channing's Memoir by his nephew, tenth ed.,
   Boston, 1874 Vol. II., pp. 431, 434, 436. The testimony of Goethe will
   have with many still greater weight. He recognized in the Gospels the
   highest manifestation of the Divine which ever appeared in this world,
   and the summit of moral culture beyond which the human mind can never
   rise, however much it may progress in any other direction. "Ich halte
   die Evangelien," he says, "für durchaus ächt; denn es ist in ihnen der
   Abglanz einer Hoheit wirksam, die von der Person Christi ausging: die
   ist qöttlicher Art, wie nur je auf Erden das Göttliche erschienen ist."
   (Gespräche mit Eckermann, III., 371.) Shortly before his death he said
   to the same friend: "Wir wissen gar nicht, was wir Luther'n und der
   Reformation zu danken haben. Mag die geistige Cultur immer
   Fortschreiten, mögen die Naturwissenschaften in immer breiterer
   Ausdehnung und Tiefe wachsen und der menschliche Geist sick erweitern
   wie er will: über die Hoheit und sittliche Cultur des Christenthums,
   wie es in den Evangelien leuchtet, wird er nicht hinauskommen." And
   such Gospels Strauss and Renan would fain make us believe to be poetic
   fictions of illiterate Galilaeans! This would be the most incredible
   miracle of all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [871] The Greek word euangelion which passed into the Latin evangelium,
   and through this into modern languages (French, German, Italian, etc.),
   means 1st, reward for good news to the messenger (in Homer); 2d, good
   news, glad tidings; 3d, glad tidings of Christ and his salvation (so in
   the New Test.); 4th, the record of these glad tidings (so in the
   headings of the Gospels and in ecclesiastical usage). The Saxon
   "gospel," i.e., God's spell or good spell (from spellian, to tell), is
   the nearest idiomatic equivalent for euangelion.

   [872] Irenaeus very properly calls them tetramorphon to euangelion,
   heni pneumati sunechomenon, quadriforme evangelium quod uno spiritu
   continetur. Adv. Haer. III. 11, § 8.

   [873] This is expressly disclaimed in John 20:30; comp. 21:25

   [874] Hence Justin Martyr, in his two "Apologies" (written about 146),
   calls the Gospels "Memoirs" or "Memorabilia" (Apomnemoneumata) of
   Christ or of the Apostles, in imitation no doubt of the Memorabilia of
   Socrates by Xenophon. That Justin means no other books but our
   canonical Gospels by theme "Memoirs," which he says were read in public
   worship on Sunday, there can be no reasonable doubt. See especially Dr.
   Abbot's Authorship of the Fourth Gospel, 1880.

   [876] This characterization is very old, and goes back to Gregory

   § 79. The Synoptists.

   (See the Lit. in § 78.)

   The Synoptic Problem.

   The fourth Gospel stands by itself and differs widely from the others
   in contents and style, as well as in distance of time of composition.
   There can be no doubt that the author, writing towards the close of the
   first century, must have known the three older ones.

   But the first three Gospels present the unique phenomenon of a most
   striking agreement and an equally striking disagreement both in matter
   and style, such as is not found among any three writers on the same
   subject. Hence they are called the Synoptic or Synoptical Gospels, and
   the three Evangelists, Synoptists. [878] This fact makes a harmony of
   the Gospels possible in all essentials, and yet impossible in many
   minor details. The agreement is often literal, and the disagreement
   often borders on contradiction, but without invalidating the essential
   harmony.

   The interrelationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke is, perhaps, the
   most complicated and perplexing critical problem in the history of
   literature. The problem derives great importance from its close
   connection with the life of Christ, and has therefore tried to the
   utmost the learning, acumen, and ingenuity of modern scholars for
   nearly a century. The range of hypotheses has been almost exhausted,
   and yet no harmonious conclusion reached.

   The Relationship.

   The general agreement of the Synoptists consists:

   1. In the harmonious delineation of the character of Christ. The
   physiognomy is the same, only under three somewhat different aspects.
   All represent him as the Son of man and as the Son of God, as the
   promised Messiah and Saviour, teaching the purest doctrine, living a
   spotless life, performing mighty miracles, suffering and dying for the
   sins of the world, and rising in triumph to establish his kingdom of
   truth and righteousness. Such unity in the unique character of the hero
   of the three narratives has no parallel in secular or sacred histories
   or biographies, and is the best guarantee of the truthfulness of the
   picture.

   2. In the plan and arrangement of the evangelical history, yet with
   striking peculiarities.

   (a.) Matthew 1-2, and Luke 1-2, and 3:23-38, begin with the genealogy
   and infancy of Christ, but with different facts drawn from different
   sources. Mark opens at once with the preaching of the Baptist; while
   the fourth Evangelist goes back to the eternal pre-existence of the
   Logos. About the thirty years of Christ's private life and his quiet
   training for the great work they are all silent, with the exception of
   Luke, who gives us a glimpse of his early youth in the temple
   (Luke2:42-52).

   (b.) The preaching and baptism of John which prepared the way for the
   public ministry of Christ, is related by all the Synoptists in parallel
   sections: Matt. 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18.

   (c.) Christ's baptism and temptation, the Messianic inauguration and
   Messianic trial: Matt. 3:13-17; 4:1-11; Mark 1:9-11, 12, 13 (very
   brief); Luke 3:21-23; 4:1-13. The variations here between Matthew and
   Luke are very slight, as in the order of the second and third
   temptation. John gives the testimony of the Baptist to Christ, and
   alludes to his baptism (John 1:32-34), but differs from the Synoptists.

   (d.) The public ministry of Christ in Galilee: Matt. 4:12-18:35; Mark
   1:14-9:50; Luke 4:14-9:50. But Matthew 14:22-16:12, and Mark 6:45-8:26,
   narrate a series of events connected with the Galilaean ministry, which
   are wanting in Luke; while Luke 9:51-18:14, has another series of
   events and parables connected with the last journey to Jerusalem which
   are peculiar to him.

   (e.) The journey to Jerusalem: Matt. 19:1-20:31; Mark 10:1-52; Luke
   18:15-19:28.

   (f.) The entry into Jerusalem and activity there during the week before
   the last passover: Matt. 21-25; Mark 11-13; Luke 19:29-21:38.

   (g.) The passion, crucifixion, and resurrection in parallel sections,
   but with considerable minor divergences, especially in the denial of
   Peter and the history of the resurrection: Matt. 26-28; Mark 14-16;
   Luke 22-24.

   The events of the last week, from the entry to the resurrection (from
   Palm Sunday to Easter), occupy in all the largest space, about
   one-fourth of the whole narrative.

   3. In the selection of the same material and in verbal coincidences, as
   in the eschatological discourses of Christ, with an almost equal number
   of little differences. Thus the three accounts of the hearing of the
   paralytic (Matt. 9:1-8, and parallel passages), the feeding of the five
   thousand, the transfiguration, almost verbally agree. Occasionally the
   Synoptists concur in rare and difficult words and forms in the same
   connection, as epiousios [in tee Lords Prapser], tee diminutie otion,
   little ear (of Malchus, Matt. 26:51, and parallel passages),
   duskolos,hard (for a rich man to enter into the kingdom, Matt. 19:23,
   etc.). These coincidences are the more striking since our Lord spoke
   usually in Aramaic; but those words may have been Palestinian
   provincialisms. [879]

   The largest portion of verbal agreement, to the extent of about
   seven-eighths, is found in the words of others, especially of Christ;
   and the largest portion of disagreement in the narratives of the
   writers. [880] This fact bears against the theory of interdependence,
   and proves, on the one hand, the reverent loyalty of all the Synoptists
   to the teaching of the great Master, but also, on the other hand, their
   freedom and independence of observation and judgment in the narration
   of facts. Words can be accurately reported only in one form, as they
   were spoken; while events may be correctly narrated in different words.

   Numerical Estimates Of The Harmony And Variation.

   The extent of the coincidences, and divergences admits of an
   approximate calculation by sections, verses, and words. In every case
   the difference of size must be kept in mind: Luke is the largest, with
   72 pages (in Westcott and Hort's Greek Testament); Matthew comes next,
   with 68 pages; Mark last, with 42 pages. (John has 55 pages.)

   1. Estimate by Sections.

   Matthew has in all 78, Mark, 67, Luke, 93 sections.

   Dividing the Synoptic text into 124 sections, with Dr. Reuss, [881]

   All Evangelists have in common 47 sections.

   Matthew and Mark alone have 12 "

   Matthew and Luke " " 2 "

   Mark and Luke " " 6 "

   Sections peculiar to Matthew 17

   " " " Mark 2

   " " " Luke 38

   Another arrangement by sections has been made by Norton, Stroud, and
   Westcott. [882] If the total contents of the Gospels be represented by
   100, the following result is obtained:

   Mark has 7 peculiarities and 93 coincidences.

   Matthew has 42 " " 58 "

   Luke has 59 " " 41 "

   [John has 92 " " 8 " ]

   If the extent of all the coincidences be represented by 100, their
   proportion is:

   Matthew, Mark, and Luke have 53 coincidences.

   Matthew and Luke have 21 "

   Matthew and Mark have 20 "

   Mark and Luke have 6 "

   "In St. Mark," says Westcott, "there are not more than twenty-four
   verses to which no parallel exists in St. Matthew and St. Luke, though
   St. Mark exhibits everywhere traits of vivid detail which are peculiar
   to his narrative."

   2. Estimate by Verses.

   According to the calculation of Reuss, [883]

   Matthew contains 330 verses peculiar to him.

   Mark contains 68 " " "

   Luke contains 541 " " "

   Matthew and Mark have from 170 to 180 verses in common, but not found
   in Luke.

   Matthew and Luke have from 230 to 240 verses in common, but not found
   in Mark.

   Mark and Luke have about 50 verses in common, but not found in Matthew.

   The total number of verses common to all three Synoptists is only from
   330 to 370. But, as the verses in the second Gospel are generally
   shorter, it is impossible to make an exact mathematical calculation by
   verses.

   3. Estimate by Words.

   A still more accurate test can be furnished by the number of words.
   This has not yet been made as far as I know, but a basis of calculation
   is furnished by Rushbrooke in his admirably printed Synopticon (1880),
   where the words common to the three Synoptists, the words common to
   each pair, and the words peculiar to each, are distinguished by
   different type and color. [884] The words found in all constitute the
   "triple tradition," and the nearest approximation to the common Greek
   source from which all have directly or indirectly drawn. On the basis
   of this Synopticon the following calculations have been made:

   A. -- Number of words in

   Words common to all

   Per cent of words in common.

   Matthew 18, 222

   2,651, or

   .14 1/2

   Mark 11, 158

   2,651, or

   .23 3/4

   Luke 19, 209

   2,651, or

   .13 3/4

   Total 48,589

   7,953, or

   .16 1/3

   B. -- Additional words in common. Whole per cent in common

   Matthew 2, 793 (or in all 5,444) with Mark 29+

   Mark 2, 793 (or in all 5,444) with Matthew 48+

   Matthew 2, 415 (or in all 5,066) with Luke 27+

   Luke 2, 415 (or in all 5,066) with Matthew 26+

   Mark 1, 174 (or in all 3,825) with Luke 34+

   Luke 1, 174 (or in all 3,825) with Mark 20-

   C. -- Words peculiar to Matthew 10, 363, or 56+ percent.

   Words peculiar to Mark 4,540, or 40+ percent

   Words peculiar to Luke 12,969, or 67+ percent

   Total 27,872

   D. -- These figures give the following results:

   (a.) The proportion of words peculiar to the Synoptic Gospels is 28,000
   out of 48,000, more than one half.

   In Matthew 56 words out of every 100 are peculiar.

   In Mark 40 words out of every 100 are peculiar.

   In Luke 67 words out of every 100 are peculiar.

   (b.) The number of coincidences common to all three is less than the
   number of the divergences.

   Matthew agrees with the other two Gospels in 1 word out of 7.

   Mark agrees with the other two Gospels in 1 word out of 4½.

   Luke agrees with the other two Gospels in 1 word out of 8.

   (c.) But, comparing the Gospels two by two, it is evident that Matthew
   and Mark have most in common, and Matthew and Luke are most divergent.

   One-half of Mark is found in Matthew.

   One fourth of Luke is found in Matthew.

   One-third of Mark is found in Luke. [885]

   (d.) The general conclusion from these figures is that all three
   Gospels widely diverge from the common matter, or triple tradition,
   Mark the least so and Luke the most (almost twice as much as Mark). On
   the other hand, both Matthew and Luke are nearer Mark than Luke and
   Matthew are to each other.

   The Solution of the Problem.

   Three ways open themselves for a solution of the Synoptic problem:
   either the Synoptists depend on one another; or they all depend on
   older sources; or the dependence is of both kinds. Each of these
   hypotheses admits again of several modifications. [886]

   A satisfactory solution of the problem must account for the differences
   as well as for the coincidences. If this test be applied, the first and
   the third hypotheses with their various modifications must be ruled out
   as unsatisfactory, and we are shut up to the second as at least the
   most probable.

   The Canonical Gospels Independent of One Another.

   There is no direct evidence that any of the three Synoptists saw and
   used the work of the others; nor is the agreement of such a character
   that it may not be as easily and better explained from antecedent
   sources. The advocates of the theory of interdependency, or the
   "borrowing" hypothesis, [887] differ widely among themselves: some make
   Matthew, others. Mark, others Luke, the source of the other two or at
   least of one of them; while still others go back from the Synoptists in
   their present form to a proto-Mark (Urmarkus), or proto-Matthew
   (Urmatthaeus), proto-Luke (Urlukas), or other fictitious antecanonical
   documents; thereby confessing the insufficiency of the borrowing
   hypothesis pure and simple.

   There is no allusion in any of the Synoptists to the others; and yet
   Luke expressly refers to many earlier attempts to write the gospel
   history. Papias, Irenaeus, and other ancient writers assume that they
   wrote independently. [888] The first who made Mark a copyist of Matthew
   is Augustin, and his view has been completely reversed by modern
   research. The whole theory degrades one or two Synoptists to the
   position of slavish and yet arbitrary compilers, not to say
   plagiarists; it assumes a strange mixture of dependence and affected
   originality; it weakens the independent value of their history; and it
   does not account for the omissions of most important matter, and for
   many differences in common matter. For the Synoptists often differ just
   where we should most expect them to agree. Why should Mark be silent
   about the history of the infancy, the whole sermon on the Mount (the
   Magna Charta of Christ's kingdom), the Lord's Prayer, and important
   parables, if he had Matthew 1-2, 5-7, 13, before him? Why should he, a
   pupil of Peter, record the Lord's severe rebuke to Peter (Mark
   8:27-33), but fail to mention from Matthew 16:16-23 the preceding
   remarkable laudation: "Thou art Rock, and upon this rock I will build
   my church?" Why should Luke omit the greater part of the sermon on the
   Mount, and all the appearances of the risen Lord in Galilee? Why should
   he ignore the touching anointing scene in Bethany, and thus neglect to
   aid in fulfilling the Lord's prediction that this act of devotion
   should be spoken of as a memorial of Mary "wheresoever this gospel
   shall be preached in the whole world (Matt. 26:13; Mark 14:9)? Why
   should he, the pupil and companion of Paul, fail to record the
   adoration of the Magi, the story of the woman of Canaan, and the
   command to evangelize the Gentiles, so clearly related by Matthew, the
   Evangelist of the Jews (Matt. 2:1-12; 15:21-28; 24:14; 28:19)? Why
   should Luke and Matthew give different genealogies of Christ, and even
   different reports of the model prayer of our Lord, Luke omitting
   (beside the doxology, which is also wanting in the best MSS. of
   Matthew) the petition, "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth,"
   and the concluding petition, "but deliver us from evil" (or "the evil
   one"), and substituting "sins" for "debts," and "Father" for "Our
   Father who art in heaven"? Why should all three Synoptists differ even
   in the brief and official title on the Cross, and in the words of
   institution of the Lord's Supper, where Paul, writing in 57, agrees
   with Luke, referring to a revelation from the Lord (1 Cor. 11:23)? Had
   the Synoptists seen the work of the others, they could easily have
   harmonized these discrepancies and avoided the appearance of
   contradiction. To suppose that they purposely varied to conceal
   plagiarism is a moral impossibility. We can conceive no reasonable
   motive of adding a third Gospel to two already known to the writer,
   except on the ground of serious defects, which do not exist (certainly
   not in Matthew and Luke as compared with Mark), or on the ground of a
   presumption which is inconsistent with the modest tone and the omission
   of the very name of the writers.

   These difficulties are felt by the ablest advocates of the borrowing
   hypothesis, and hence they call to aid one or several pre-canonical
   Gospels which are to account for the startling discrepancies and signs
   of independence, whether in omissions or additions or arrangement. But
   these pre-canonical Gospels, with the exception of the lost Hebrew
   Matthew, are as fictitious as the Syro-Chaldaic Urevangelium of
   Eichhorn, and have been compared to the epicycles of the old
   astronomers, which were invented to sustain the tottering hypothesis of
   cycles.

   As to Luke, we have shown that he departs most from the triple
   tradition, although he is supposed to have written last, and it is now
   almost universally agreed that he did not use the canonical Matthew.
   [889] Whether he used the Hebrew Matthew and the Greek Mark or a lost
   proto-Mark, is disputed, and at least very doubtful. [890] He follows a
   plan of his own; he ignores a whole cycle of events in Mark 6:45-8:26;
   he omits in the common sections the graphic touches of Mark, for which
   he has others equally graphic; and with a far better knowledge of Greek
   he has yet more Hebraisms than Mark, because he drew largely on Hebrew
   sources. As to Matthew, he makes the impression of primitive antiquity,
   and his originality and completeness have found able advocates from
   Augustin down to Griesbach and Keim. And as to Mark, his apparent
   abridgments, far from being the work of a copyist, are simply rapid
   statements of an original writer, with many fresh and lively details
   which abundantly prove his independence. On the other hand, in several
   narratives he is more full and minute than either Matthew or Luke.
   [891] His independence has been successfully proven by the most
   laborious and minute investigations and comparisons. [892] Hence many
   regard him as the primitive Evangelist made use of by both Matthew and
   Luke, but disagree among themselves as to whether it was the canonical
   Mark or a proto-Mark. [893] In either case Matthew and Luke would be
   guilty of plagiarism. What should we think of an historian of our day
   who would plunder another historian of one-third or one-half of the
   contents of his book without a word of acknowledgment direct or
   indirect? Let us give the Evangelists at least the credit of common
   honesty, which is the basis of all morality.

   Apostolic Teaching the Primary Source of All the Synoptists.

   The only certain basis for the solution of the problem is given to us
   in the preface of Luke. He mentions two sources of his own Gospel--but
   not necessarily of the two other Synoptic Gospels--namely, the oral
   tradition or deliverance of original "eyewitnesses and ministers of the
   word" (apostles, evangelists, and other primitive disciples), and a
   number of written "narratives," drawn up by "many," but evidently
   incomplete and fragmentary, so as to induce him to prepare, after
   accurate investigation, a regular history of "those matters which have
   been fulfilled among us." Besides this important hint, we may be aided
   by the well-known statements of Papias about the Hebrew Gospel of
   Matthew and the Greek Mark, whom he represents as the interpret

   The chief and common source from which the Synoptists derived their
   Gospels was undoubtedly the living apostolic tradition or teaching
   which is mentioned by Luke in the first order. This teaching was
   nothing more or less than a faithful report of the words and deeds of
   Christ himself by honest and intelligent eye-witnesses. [894] He told
   his disciples to preach, not to write, the gospel, although the writing
   was, of course, not forbidden, but became necessary for the
   preservation of the gospel in its purity. They had at first only
   "hearers;" while the law and the prophets had readers. [895]

   Among the Jews and Arabs the memory was specially trained in the
   accurate repetition and perpetuation of sacred words and facts. [896]
   The Mishna was not reduced to writing for two or three hundred years.
   In the East everything is more settled and stationary than in the West,
   and the traveller feels himself as by magic transferred back to manners
   and habits as well as the surroundings of apostolic and patriarchal
   times. The memory is strongest where it depends most on itself and
   least upon books. [897]

   The apostolic tradition or preaching was chiefly historical, a recital
   of the wonderful public life of Jesus of Nazareth, and centred in the
   crowning facts of the crucifixion and resurrection. This is evident
   from the specimens of sermons in the Acts. The story was repeated in
   public and in private from day to day and sabbath to sabbath. The
   apostles and primitive evangelists adhered closely and reverently to
   what they saw and heard from their divine Master, and their disciples
   faithfully reproduced their testimony. "They continued steadfastly in
   the apostles' teaching" (Acts 2:42). Reverence would forbid them to
   vary from it; and yet no single individual, not even Peter or John,
   could take in the whole fulness of Christ. One recollected this,
   another another part of the gospel story; one had a better memory for
   words, another for facts. These differences, according to varying
   capacities and recollection, would naturally appear, and the common
   tradition adapted itself, without any essential alteration, to
   particular classes of hearers who were first Hebrews in Palestine, then
   Greek Jews, proselytes, and Gentiles.

   The Gospels are nothing more than comprehensive summaries of this
   apostolic preaching and teaching. Mark represents it in its simplest
   and briefest form, and agrees nearest with the preaching of Peter as
   far as we know it from the Acts; it is the oldest in essence, though
   not necessarily in composition. Matthew and Luke contain the same
   tradition in its expanded and more matured form, the one the Hebrew or
   Jewish Christian, the other the Hellenistic and Pauline type, with a
   corresponding selection of details. Mark gives a graphic account of the
   main facts of the public life of Christ "beginning from the baptism of
   John unto the day that he was received up," as they would naturally be
   first presented to an audience (Acts 1:22). Matthew and Luke add the
   history of the infancy and many discourses, facts, and details which
   would usually be presented in a fuller course of instruction.

   Written Documents.

   It is very natural that parts of the tradition were reduced to writing
   during the thirty years which intervened between the events and the
   composition of the canonical Gospels. One evangelist would record for
   his own use a sketch of the chief events, another the sermon on the
   Mount, another the parables, another the history of the crucifixion and
   resurrection, still another would gather from the lips of Mary the
   history of the infancy and the genealogies. Possibly some of the first
   hearers noted down certain words and events under the fresh impressions
   of the moment. The apostles were indeed unlearned, but not illiterate
   men, they could read and write and had sufficient rudimentary education
   for ordinary composition. These early memoranda were numerous, but have
   all disappeared, they were not intended for publication, or if
   published they were superseded by the canonical Gospels. Hence there is
   room here for much speculation and conjectural criticism. [898] "Many,"
   says Luke, "have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those
   matters which have been fulfilled among us." [899] He cannot mean the
   apocryphal Gospels which were not yet written, nor the canonical
   Gospels of Matthew and Mark which would have spared him much trouble
   and which he would not have dared to supersede by an improved work of
   his own without a word of acknowledgment, but pre-canonical records,
   now lost, which emanated from "eye-witnesses and ministers of the
   word," yet were so fragmentary and incomplete as to justify his own
   attempt to furnish a more satisfactory and connected history. He had
   the best opportunity to gather such documents in Palestine, Antioch,
   Greece, and Rome. Matthew, being himself an eyewitness, and Mark, being
   the companion of Peter, had less need of previous documents, and could
   rely chiefly, oil their own memory and the living tradition in its
   primitive freshness. They may have written sketches or memoranda for
   their own use long before they completed their Gospels; for such
   important works cannot be prepared without long continued labor and
   care. The best books grow gradually and silently like trees.

   Conclusion.

   We conclude, then, that the Synoptists prepared their Gospels
   independently, during the same period (say between a.d. 60 and 69), in
   different places, chiefly from the living teaching of Christ and the
   first disciples, and partly from earlier fragmentary documents. They
   bear independent testimony to the truth of the gospel. Their agreement
   and disagreement are not the result of design, but of the unity,
   richness, and variety of the original story as received, understood,
   digested, and applied by different minds to different conditions and
   classes of hearers and readers. [900]

   The Traditional Order.

   There is no good reason to doubt that the canonical arrangement which
   is supported by the prevailing oldest tradition, correctly represents
   the order of composition. [901] Matthew, the apostle, wrote first in
   Aramaic and in Palestine, from his personal observation and experience
   with the aid of tradition; Mark next, in Rome, faithfully reproducing
   Peter's preaching; Luke last, from tradition and sundry reliable but
   fragmentary documents. But all wrote under a higher inspiration, and
   are equally honest and equally trustworthy; all wrote within the
   lifetime of many of the primitive witnesses, before the first
   generation of Christians had passed away, and before there was any
   chance for mythical and legendary accretions. They wrote not too late
   to insure faithfulness, nor too early to prevent corruption. They
   represent not the turbid stream of apocryphal afterthoughts and
   fictions, but the pure fountain of historic truth.

   The gospel story, being once fixed in this completed shape, remained
   unchanged for all time to come. Nothing was lost, nothing added. The
   earlier sketches or pre-canonical gospel fragments disappeared, and the
   four canonical records of the one gospel, no more nor less, sufficient
   for all purposes, monopolized the field from which neither apocryphal
   caricatures nor sceptical speculations have been able to drive them.

   Exoteric and Esoteric Tradition.

   Besides the common Galilaean tradition for the people at large which is
   embodied in the Synoptic Gospels, there was an esoteric tradition of
   Christ's ministry in Judaea and his private relation to the select
   circle of the apostles and his mysterious relation to the Father. The
   bearer of this tradition was the beloved disciple who leaned on the
   beating heart of his Master and absorbed his deepest words. He
   treasured them up in his memory, and at last when the church was ripe
   for this higher revelation he embodied it in the fourth Gospel.

   Notes.

   The problem of the Relationship of the Synoptists was first seriously
   discussed by Augustin (d. 430), in his three books De Consensu
   Evangelistarum (Opera, Tom. III., 1041-1230, ed. Migne). He defends the
   order in our canon, first Matthew, last John, and the two apostolic
   disciples in the middle (in loco medio constituti tamquam filii
   amplectendi, I., 2), but wrongly makes Mark dependent on Matthew (see
   below, sub. I. 1). His view prevailed during the middle ages and down
   to the close of the eighteenth century. The verbal inspiration theory
   checked critical investigation.

   The problem was resumed with Protestant freedom by Storr (1786), more
   elaborately by Eichhorn (1794), and Marsh (1803), and again by Hug (a
   liberal Roman Catholic scholar, 1808), Schleiermacher (1817), Gieseler
   (1818), De Wette (1826), Credner (1836), and others. It received a new
   impulse and importance by the Leben Jesu of Strauss (1836), and the
   Tübingen school, and has been carried forward by Baur (1847),
   Hilgenfeld, Bleek, Reuss, Holtzmann, Ewald, Meyer, Keim, Weiss, and
   others mentioned in the Literature (p. 577). Starting in Germany, the
   investigation was prosecuted also in France, Holland, England, and the
   United States.

   It is not easy to find a way through the labyrinth of the Synoptic
   question, with all its by-ways and cross-ways, turns and windings,
   which at first make the impression:


   "Mir wird von alle dem so dumm,

   Als ging mir ein Mühlrad im Kopf herum."

   Holtzmann gives a brief history of opinions (in his able work, Die
   Synopt. Evang.) down to 1863, and Hilgenfeld (Hist. Krit. Einl. in das
   N. T, pp. 173-210) down to 1874. Comp. also Reuss (Gesch. der heil.
   Schr. N. T., I., §§ 165-198, 6th ed., 1887), Holtzmann, Einleitung, 351
   sqq., and Weiss, Einl., 473 sqq. The following classification of
   theories is tolerably complete, but several overlap each other, or are
   combined.

   I. The Inspiration hypothesis cuts the gordian knot by tracing the
   agreement of the Synoptists directly and solely to the Holy Spirit. But
   this explains nothing, and makes God responsible for all the
   discrepancies and possible inaccuracies of the Evangelists. No
   inspiration theory can stand for a moment which does not leave room for
   the personal agency and individual peculiarities of the sacred authors
   and the exercise of their natural faculties in writing. Luke expressly
   states in the preface his own agency in composing his Gospel and the
   use he made of his means of information.

   II. The Interdependency hypothesis, or Borrowing hypothesis
   (Benützungshypothese) holds that one or two Evangelists borrowed from
   the other. This admits of as many modifications as the order in which
   they may be placed.

   1. Matthew, Mark, Luke. This is the traditional order defended by
   Augustin, who called Mark, rather disrespectfully, a "footman and
   abbreviator of Matthew" (tamquam pedissequus et breviator Matthäi, II.,
   3), Grotius, Mill, Bengel, Wetstein, Hug (1808), Hilgenfeld,
   Klostermann, Keil. Among English writers Townson and Greswell.

   Many scholars besides those just mentioned hold to this order without
   admitting an interdependence, and this I think is the correct view, in
   connection with the tradition hypothesis. See below, sub V. and the
   text.

   2. Matthew, Luke, Mark. So first Clement of Alexandria (Eus., H. E.,
   VI. 14), but, without intimating a dependence of Mark except on Peter.
   Griesbach (in two Programs, 1789) renewed this order and made Mark an
   extract from both Matthew and Luke. So Theile (1825), Fritzsche (1830),
   Sieffert (1832), De Wette, Bleek, Anger, Strauss, Baur, Keim. The
   Tübingen school utilized this order for the tendency theory (see
   below). Keim puts Matthew a.d. 66, Luke, 90, Mark, 100.

   Bleek is the most considerate advocate of this order (Einleitung in das
   N. T., 2d ed., 1866, 91 sqq., 245 sqq.), but Mangold changed it (in the
   third ed. of Bleek, 1875, pp. 388 sqq.) in favor of the priority of a
   proto-Mark.

   3. Mark, Matthew, Luke. The originality and priority of Mark was first
   suggested by Koppe (1782) and Storr (1786 and 1794). The same view was
   renewed by Lachmann (1835), elaborately carried out by Weisse (1838,
   1856; Hilgenfeld calls him the "Urheber der conservativen
   Markushypothese "), and still more minutely in all details by Wilke
   (Der Urevangelist, 1838; but he assumes numerous interpolations in the
   present Mark and goes back to a proto-Mark), and by B. Weiss (Das
   Marcusevangelium, 1872). It is maintained in various ways by Hitzig
   (Johannes Markus, 1843), Ewald (1850, but with various prior sources),
   Ritschl (1851), Reuss, Thiersch, Tobler, Réville (1862), Eichthal
   (1863), Schenkel, Wittichen, Holtzmann (1863), Weizsäcker (1864),
   Scholten (1869), Meyer (Com. on Matt., 6th ed., 1876, p. 35), Renan
   (Les Évangiles, 1877, pp. 113, but the Greek Mark was preceded by the
   lost Hebrew Matthew, p. 93 sqq.). Among English writers, James Smith,
   of Jordan Hill (Dissertat. on the Origin of the Gospels, etc., Edinb.,
   1853), G. P. Fisher (Beginnings of Christianity, New York, 1877, p.
   275), and E. A. Abbott (in "Encyclop. Brit.," vol. X., 1879, art.
   "Gospels") adopt the same view.

   The priority of Mark is now the prevailing theory among German critics,
   notwithstanding the protest of Baur and Keim, who had almost a personal
   animosity against the second Evangelist. One of the last utterances of
   Keim was a passionate protest against the Präkonisation des Markus (Aus
   dem Urchristenthum, 1878, pp. 28-45). But the advocates of this theory
   are divided on the question whether the canonical Mark or a lost
   proto-Mark was the primitive evangelist. The one is called the
   Markushypothese, the other the Urmarkushypothese. We admit the
   originality of Mark, but this does not necessarily imply priority of
   composition. Matthew and Luke have too much original matter to be
   dependent on Mark, and are far more valuable, as a whole, though Mark
   is indispensable for particulars.

   4. Mark, Luke, Matthew. Herder (1796), Volkmar (1866 and 1870).

   5. Luke, Matthew, Mark. Büsching (1776), Evanson (1792).

   6. Luke, Mark, Matthew. Vogel (1804), Schneckenburger (1882).

   The conflicting variety of these modifications shakes the whole
   borrowing theory. It makes the omissions of most important sections, as
   Matt. 12-17; 14:22 - 16:12; and Luke 10-18:14, and the discrepancies in
   the common sections entirely inexplicable. See text.

   III. The hypothesis of a Primitive Gospel (Urevangelium) written before
   those of the Synoptists and used by them as their common source, but
   now lost.

   1. A lost Hebrew or Syro-Chaldaic Gospel of official character, written
   very early, about 35, in Palestine by the apostles as a manual for the
   travelling preachers. This is the famous Urevangeliumshypothese of the
   learned Professor Eichhorn (1794, 1804, 1820), adopted and modified by
   Bishop Herbert Marsh (1803), Gratz (1809), and Bertholdt (who, as Baur
   says, was devoted to it with "carnal self-security").

   But there is no trace of such an important Gospel, either Hebrew or
   Greek. Luke knows nothing about it, although he speaks of several
   attempts to write portions of the history. To carry out his hypothesis,
   Eichhorn was forced to assume four altered copies or recensions of the
   original document, and afterwards he added also Greek recensions.
   Marsh, outgermanizing the German critic, increased the number of
   recensions to eight, including a Greek translation of the Hebrew
   original. Thus a new recension might be invented for every new set of
   facts ad infinitum. If the original Gospel was an apostolic
   composition, it needed no alterations and would have been preserved; or
   if it was so defective, it was of small account and unfit to be used as
   a basis of the canonical Gospels. Eichhorn's hypothesis is now
   generally abandoned, but in modified shape it has been renewed by Ewald
   and others. See below.

   2. The Gospel "according to the Hebrews," of which some fragments still
   remain. Lessing (1784, in a book published three years after his
   death), Semler (who, however, changed his view repeatedly), Weber
   (1791), Paulus (1799). But this was a heretical or Ebionitic corruption
   of Matthew, and the remaining fragments differ widely from the
   canonical Gospels.

   3. The Hebrew Matthew (Urmatthäus). It is supposed in this case that
   the famous Logia, which Matthew is reported by Papias to have written
   in Hebrew, consisted not only of a collection of discourses of our Lord
   (as Schleiermacher, Ewald, Reuss, I., 183, explained the term), but
   also of his deeds: "things said and done." But in any case the Hebrew
   Matthew is lost and cannot form a safe basis for conclusions. Hug and
   Roberts deny that it ever existed. See next section.

   4. The canonical Mark.

   5. A pre-canonical proto-Mark (Urmarkus). The last two hypotheses have
   already been mentioned under the second general head (II. 3).

   IV. The theory of a number of fragmentary documents (the
   Diegesentheorie), or different recensions. It is based on the remark of
   Luke that "many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative
   (diegesinconcerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us"
   (Luke 1:1). Schleiermacher (1817) assumed a large number of such
   written documents, or detached narratives, and dealt very freely with
   the Synoptists, resting his faith chiefly on John.

   Ewald (1850) independently carried out a similar view in fierce
   opposition to the "beastly wildness" of the Tübingen school. He informs
   us with his usual oracular self-assurance that Philip, the evangelist
   (Acts 8), first wrote a historical sketch in Hebrew, and then Matthew a
   collection of discourses (the logiaof Papias), also in Hebrew, of which
   several Greek translations were made; that Mark was the third, Matthew
   the fifth, and Luke the ninth in this series of Gospels, representing
   the "Höhebilder, die himmlische Fortbewegung der Geschichte," which at
   last assumed their most perfect shape in John.

   Köstlin, Wittichen, and Scholten likewise assume a number of
   precanonical Gospels which exist only in their critical fancy.

   Renan (Les Evang., Introd., p. vi.) distinguishes three sets of
   Gospels: (1) original Gospels of the first hand, taken from the oral
   tradition without a previous written text: the Hebrew Matthew and the
   Greek proto-Mark; (2) Gospels partly original and partly second-handed:
   our canonical Gospels falsely attributed to Matthew, Mark, and Luke;
   (3) Gospels of the second and third hand: Marcion's and the Apocryphal
   Gospels.

   V. The theory of a common Oral Tradition (Traditionshypothese). Herder
   (1796), Gieseler (who first fully developed it, 1818), Schulz (1829),
   Credner, Lange, Ebrard (1868), Thiersch (1845, 1852), Norton, Alford,
   Westcott (1860, 6th ed., 1881), Godet (1873), Keil (1877), and others.
   The Gospel story by constant repetition assumed or rather had from the
   beginning a uniform shape, even in minute particulars, especially in
   the words of Christ. True, as far as it goes, but must be supplemented,
   at least in the case of Luke, by pre-canonical, fragmentary documents
   or memoranda (diegeseis). See the text.

   VI. The Tendency hypothesis (Tendenzhypothese), or the theory of
   Doctrinal Adaptation. Baur (1847) and the Tübingen school (Schwegler,
   Ritschl, Volkmar, Hilgenfeld, Köstlin), followed in England by Samuel
   Davidson (in his Introd. to the New Test., 1868, revised ed., 1882).
   Each Evangelist modified the Gospel history in the interest of the
   religious school or party to which he belonged. Matthew represents the
   Jewish Christian, Luke the Pauline or Gentile Christian tendency, Mark
   obliterates the difference, or prepares the way from the first to the
   second. Every individual trait or characteristic feature of a Gospel is
   connected with the dogmatic antithesis between Petrinism and Paulinism.
   Baur regarded Matthew as relatively the most primitive and credible
   Gospel, but it is itself a free reproduction of a still older Aramaic
   Gospel "according to the Hebrews." He was followed by an Urlukas, a
   purely Pauline tendency Gospel. Mark is compiled from our Matthew and
   the Urlukas in the interest of neutrality. Then followed the present
   Luke with an irenical Catholic tendency. Baur overstrained the
   difference between Petrinism and Paulinism far beyond the limits of
   historic truth, transformed the sacred writers into a set of partisans
   and fighting theologians after modem fashion, set aside the fourth
   Gospel as a purely ideal fiction, and put all the Gospels about seventy
   years too far down (130-170), when they were already generally used in
   the Christian church--according to the concurrent testimonies of Justin
   Martyr, Tatian, Irenaeus, and Tertullian. Volkmar went even beyond Baur
   in reckless radicalism, although he qualified it in other respects, as
   regards the priority of Mark, the originality of Luke (as compared with
   Marcion), and the date of Matthew which he put back to about 110. See a
   summary of his views in Hilgenfeld's Einleitung, pp. 199-202. But
   Ritschl and Hilgenfeld have considerably moderated the Tübingen
   extravagancies. Ritschl puts Mark first, and herein Volkmar agrees.
   Hilgenfeld assigns the composition of Matthew to the sixth decade of
   the first century (though he thinks it was somewhat changed soon after
   the destruction of Jerusalem), then followed Mark and paved the way
   from Petrinism to Paulinism, and Luke wrote last before the close of
   the first century. He ably maintained his theory in a five years'
   conflict with the Tübingen master (1850-1855) and reasserts it in his
   Einleitung (1875). So he brings us back to the traditional order. As to
   the time of composition, the internal evidence strongly supports the
   historical tradition that the Synoptists wrote before the destruction
   of Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [878] Synopsis (conspectus), from sun, together, and opsis-i,-i view,
   is applied since Griesbach (though used before him) to a parallel
   arrangement of the Gospels so as to exhibit a general view of the whole
   and to facilitate a comparison. In some sections the fourth Gospel
   furnishes parallels, especially in the history of the passion and
   resurrection. The first three Evangelists should not be called
   Synoptics (as is done by the author of Supernatural Religion, vol. I.,
   213, and Dr. Davidson), but Synoptists. The former is a Germanism
   (Synoptiker.)

   [879] Holtzmann (p. 12) and others include also among the verbal
   coincidences the irregular apheontai (the Doric form of pass. perf., 3
   pers., plur.), Matt. 9:2, 5; Mark 2:5, 9; Luke 5:20, 23, and the double
   augment in apekatestathe, Matt. 12:13; Mark 3:5; Luke 6:10. But the
   former is ruled out by the better reading aphientai, which is adopted
   by Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Westcott and Hort, in Matt.
   9:2, 5, and in Mark 2:5. Moreover, the Doric form is not confined to
   the New Test., but somewhat widely diffused; see Moulton's Winer, p.
   97, note. And as to the double augment, it occurs also in the Sept.
   (see Trommius' Concord., I., 163, sub apokathistemi); comp. also
   apekateste in Mark 8:25. Ebrard (Wiss. Krit., p. 1054) quotes a passage
   from Pseudo-Lucian (Philiopatr., c. 27) where apekatestese occurs

   [880] Mr. Norton brings out this fact very fully in his Evidences of
   the Genuineness of the Gospels (Boston, ed. of 1875, p. 464 sq.). I
   give his results: "In Matthew's Gospel, the passages verbally
   coincident with one or both of the other two Gospels amount to less
   than a sixth part of its contents; and of this about seven-eighths
   occur in the recital of the words of others, and only about one eighth
   in what, by way of distinction, I may call mere narrative, in which the
   evangelist, speaking in his own person, was unrestrained in the choice
   of his expressions. In Mark, the proportion of coincident passages to
   the whole contents of the Gospel is about one-sixth, of which not
   one-fifth occurs in the narrative. Luke has still less agreement of
   expression with the other evangelists. The passages in which it is
   found amount only to about a tenth part of his Gospel; and but an
   inconsiderable portion of it appears in the narrative, in which there
   are few instances of its existence for more than half a dozen words
   together. In the narrative, it may be computed as less than a twentieth
   part. These definite proportions are important, as showing distinctly
   in how small a part of each Gospel there is any verbal coincidence with
   either of the other two; and to how great a degree such coincidence is
   confined to passages in which the evangelists professedly give the
   words of others, particularly of Jesus.-The proportions should,
   however, be further compared with those which the narrative part of
   each Gospel bears to that in which the words of others are professedly
   repeated. Matthew's narrative occupies about one-fourth of his Gospel,
   Mark's about one-half, and Luke's about one-third. It may easily be
   computed, therefore, that the proportion of verbal coincidence found in
   the narrative part of each Gospel, compared with what exists in the
   other part, is about in the following ratios: in Matthew as one to
   somewhat more than two, in Mark as one to four, and in Luke as one to
   ten .... We cannot explain this phenomenon by the supposition that the
   Gospels were transcribed either one from another, or all from common
   documents; for, if such transcription had been the cause, it would not
   have produced results so unequal in the different portions into which
   the Gospels naturally divide themselves."

   Testament, I. partie).

   [884] See the Literature above. Dr. Edwin A. Abbott, of London,
   suggested the work, and quotes a specimen (though all in black type) in
   his art. "Gospels" in the "Encycl. Brit." He draws from it a conclusion
   favorable to the priority of Mark, from whom, he thinks, Matthew and
   Luke have borrowed. The specimen is the parable of the wicked
   husbandmen, Matt. 21:33-44; Luke 20:9-18; Mark 12:1-11.

   [885] The following lines, representing the relative lengths of the
   three Gospels, show the extent of their verbal coincidence and
   divergence. The dots divide the lines in half, and the marks into
   thirds: Luke, -------- ---------------------- Mark, ------|--*--|------
   Matthew, ----------*------------

   [886] German scholars have convenient terms for these various
   hypotheses, as Benützungshypothese ("borrowing" hypothesis),
   Urevangeliumshypothese, Traditionshypothese, Tendenzhypothese,
   Combinationshypothese, Diegesentheorie, Markushypothese,
   Urmarkushypothese, etc. See the Notes (II)at the end of this section.

   [887] Used by recent English writers as a rendering for
   Benützungshypothese.

   [888] Clement of Alexandria makes no exception, for be merely states
   (in Euseb. H. E., VI. 14) that those Gospels which contain the
   genealogies (Matthew and Luke) were written first, Mark next, and John
   last.

   [889] So Weisse, Ewald, Reuss, Ritschl, Thiersch, Plitt, Meyer,
   Holtzmann, Weizsäcker, Mangold, Godet, Weis. See Meyer on Matthew, p.
   34 (6th ed.), and on Luke, p. 238 (6th ed. by Weiss, 1878). Only the
   Tübingen "tendency critics" maintain the contrary, and this is almost
   necessary in order to maintain the late date which they assign to Luke.
   Had he written in the second or even at the end of the first century,
   he could not possibly have been ignorant of Matthew. But him very
   independence proves his early date.

   [890] For the use of Mark by Luke are Reuss, Weiss, and most of the
   advocates of the Urmarkushypothese. Against such use are Weizsäcker,
   Godet, and all those who (with Griesbach) make Mark an epitomizer of
   Matthew and Luke. Farrar also, in his Com. on Luke, p. 9, very
   decidedly maintains the independence of Luke both on Matthew and Mark:
   "It may be regarded as certain," he says, "that among these 'attempts'
   Luke did not class the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark. The
   inference that he was either unaware of the existence of those Gospels,
   or made no direct use of them, suggests itself with the utmost force
   when we place side by side any of the events which they narrate in
   common, and mark the minute and inexplicable differences which
   incessantly occur even amid general similarity."

   [891] Compare the healing of the paralytic, Mark 2:3-12, with Matt.
   9:2-8 the murder of John the Baptist, Mark 6:14-29, with Matt. 14:1-13;
   Luke 9:7-9; the healing of the demoniac boy, Mark 9:14-29, with Matt.
   17:14-21 and Luke 9:37-43; also the accounts of Peter's denial.

   [892] I mean especially the works of Wilke (Der Urevangelist, 1838),
   Holtzmann (Die Synopt. Evang., 1863), and Weiss (Das Marcusevangelium
   und seine synoptischen Parallelen, 1872; comp. his Matthäusevangelium,
   etc., 1876). Weiss deserves all the more a hearing as he strenuously
   advocates the genuineness of John. See notes at the end of this
   section. Dr. Fisher thinks that "the independence of Mark as related to
   the other Gospels is one of the most assured and most valuable results
   of recent criticism." The Beginnings of Christianity, p. 275. Dr.
   Davidson in the "revised and improved edition" of his Introduction,
   Vol. I., 551-563, still adheres to the old Tübingen position of the
   dependence of Mark upon both Matthew and Luke, and ignores the works of
   Wilke, Holtzmann, Weiss, Renan, and the article of his own countryman,
   Abbott, in the "Encycl. Brit."

   [893] Holtzmann, Mangold, E. A. Abbott, and others go back to a
   fictitious Urmarkus; while Ewald, Meyer, and Weiss make our canonical
   Mark the basis of Matthew and Luke, yet with the important addition
   that Mark himself used, besides the oral tradition of Peter, the lost
   Hebrew Matthew, or rather a Greek translation of it, which was more
   than a mere collection of discourses (suntaxis ton logion) and embraced
   also brief narratives. But if Mark had the rich collection of our
   Lord's discourses before him, his meagreness in that department is all
   the more difficult to account for.

   [894] Luke 1:2: kathos paredosan (handed down by the living word) hemin
   hoi ap arches (i.e., from the beginning of the public ministry of
   Christ; comp. Acts 1:21 sq.; John 15:27) autoptai kai huperetai
   genomenoi tou logou (the same persons).

   [895] Hearers and hearing of the gospel are spoken of in many passages,
   as Matt. 13:14; Luke 7:1; John 12:38; Acts 17:20; Rom. 2:13; 1 Thess.
   2:13; James 1:22, 23, 25. The reading (anaginoskein) is mostly used of
   the Old Testament: Matt. 12:3, 5; 21:16, 42; 24:15; Mark 25; 12:10, 26;
   13:14; Luke 4:16; 6: 3; 10:26; Acts 8:28, 30, 32; 13:27; 15:21, etc.;
   of the Epistles of Paul: Eph. 3:4; Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 6:27; of the
   book of Revelation: Rev. 1:3; 5:4.

   [896] The rabbinical rule (in Shabb. f. 15, 1) was: "Verba praeceptoris
   sine ulla immutatione, ut prolata ab illo fuerunt. erant recitanda, ne
   diversa illi affingeretur sententia."

   [897] Renan, Les Evangiles, p. 96: "La tradition vivante (zosa phone
   kai menousa, Papias) était le grand réservoir où tous puisaient .... Le
   même phénomène se retrouve, du reste, dans presque toutes les
   littératures sacrées. Les Védas ont traversé des siècles sans être
   éerits; un homme qui se respectait devait les savoir par coeur. Celui
   qui avait besoin d'un manuscrit pour rêciter ces hymnes antiques
   faisait un aveu d'ignorance; aussi les copies n'en ont-elles jamais été
   estimées. Citer de mémoire la Bible, le Coran, est encore de nos jours
   un point d'honneur pour les 0rientaux." Renan thinks that most of the
   Old Testament quotations in the New Test. are from memory. My own
   observations, and those of friends residing in the East, confirm the
   uniformity of oral tradition and the remarkable strength of memory
   among the Arabs.

   [898] In such conjectures Eichhorn, Marsh, Schleiermacher, Ewald,
   Volkmar, Wittichen, and Renan have shown great ingenuity, and
   accumulated a vast amount of docta ignorantia.

   [899] Luke 1:1: polloi epecheiresan (indicating the difficulty of the
   undertaking and probably also the insufficiency of the execution)
   anataxasthai diegesin peri ton peplerophoremenon en hemin pragmaton.

   [900] In this conclusion (which I stated thirty years ago in the first
   edition of myHist. of the Ap. Ch.)some of the ablest investigators of
   the Synoptic problem independently agree, as Lange, Ebrard
   (Wissenschaftliche Kritik der ev. Gesch., third ed., pp. 1044 sqq.),
   Norton, Alford, Godet, Westcott, Farrar. "The Synoptic Gospels," says
   Alford (in his Proleg. to vol. I., p. 11, 6th ed.), contain the
   substance of the Apostles' testimony, collected principally from their
   oral teaching current in the church, partly also from written documents
   embodying portions of that teaching: there is, however, no reason, from
   their internal structure, to believe, but every reason to disbelieve
   that any one of the three evangelists had access to either of the other
   two gospels in its present form." Godet concludes his discussion (Com.
   on Luke, 2d ed., p. 556, Am. ed.) with these words: " It is impossible
   to conceive anything more capricious and less reverential than the part
   which we make the author of any one whatever of our Synoptic Gospels
   play with the history and sayings of Jesus, supposing that he had
   before him the other two, or one of them. Such an explanation will only
   be allowable when we are brought absolutely to despair of finding any
   other. And even then it were better still to say, Non liquet. For this
   explanation involves a moral contradiction. Most of our present critics
   are so well aware of this that they have recourse to middle terms."

   [901] Irenaeus, III. 1, 1; Origen in Euseb., H. E., VI. 25; Tertullian,
   and others. Irenaeus gives this order with the approximate data:
   "Matthew issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own
   dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the
   foundations of the church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple
   and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had
   been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a
   book the gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the
   Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel
   during his residence at Ephesus in Asia." Clement of Alexandria differs
   by putting Mark after Matthew and Luke, and yet before the death of
   Peter; for he says (in Eus., H. E., VI. 14), that when Peter proclaimed
   the gospel at Rome, Mark was requested by the hearers to reduce it to
   writing, which he did, Peter neither hindering nor encouraging it.
   According to this view all the Synoptists would have written before 64.

   Life of Matthew.

   Matthew, [902] formerly called Levi, one of the twelve apostles, was
   originally a publican or taxgatherer [903] at Capernaum, and hence well
   acquainted with Greek and Hebrew in bilingual Galilee, and accustomed
   to keep accounts. This occupation prepared him for writing a Gospel in
   topical order in both languages. In the three Synoptic lists of the
   apostles he is associated with Thomas, and forms with him the fourth
   pair; in Mark and Luke he precedes Thomas, in his own Gospel he is
   placed after him (perhaps from modesty). [904] Hence the conjecture
   that he was a twin brother of Thomas (Didymus, i.e., Twin), or
   associated with him in work. Thomas was an honest and earnest doubter,
   of a melancholy disposition, yet fully convinced at last when he saw
   the risen Lord; Matthew was a strong and resolute believer.

   Of his apostolic labors we have no certain information. Palestine,
   Ethiopia, Macedonia, the country of the Euphrates, Persia, and Media
   are variously assigned to him as missionary fields. He died a natural
   death according to the oldest tradition, while later accounts make him
   a martyr. [905]

   The first Gospel is his imperishable work, well worthy a long life, yea
   many lives. Matthew the publican occupies as to time the first place in
   the order of the Evangelists, as Mary Magdalene, from whom Christ
   expelled many demons, first proclaimed the glad tidings of the
   resurrection. Not that it is on that account the best or most
   important--the best comes last,--but it naturally precedes the other,
   as the basis precedes the superstructure. [906]

   In his written Gospel he still fulfils the great commission to bring
   all nations to the school of Christ (Matt. 28:19).

   The scanty information of the person and life of Matthew in connection
   with his Gospel suggests the following probable inferences:

   1. Matthew was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, yet comparatively liberal,
   being a publican who came in frequent contact with merchants from
   Damascus. This occupation was indeed disreputable in the eyes of the
   Jews, and scarcely consistent with the national Messianic aspirations;
   but Capernaum belonged to the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas, and the
   Herodian family, which, with all its subserviency to heathen Rome, was
   yet to a certain extent identified with the Jewish nation.

   2. He was a man of some means and good social position. His office was
   lucrative, he owned a house, and gave a farewell banquet to "a great
   multitude" of his old associates, at which Jesus presided. [907] It was
   at the same time his farewell to the world, its wealth, its pleasures
   and honors. "We may conceive what a joyous banquet that was for
   Matthew, when he marked the words and acts of Jesus, and stored within
   his memory the scene and the conversation which he was inspired to
   write according to his clerkly ability for the instruction of the
   church in all after ages." [908] It was on that occasion that Jesus
   spoke that word which was especially applicable to Matthew and
   especially offensive to the Pharisees present: "I came not to call the
   righteous, but sinners." It is remarkable that the first post-apostolic
   quotation from the Gospel of Matthew is this very passage, and one
   similar to it (see below).

   3. He was a man of decision of character and capable of great sacrifice
   to his conviction. When called, while sitting in Oriental fashion at
   his tollbooth, to follow Jesus, he "forsook all, rose up, and followed
   Him," whom he at once recognized and trusted as the true king of
   Israel. [909] No one can do more than leave his "all," no matter how
   much or how little this may be; and no one can do better than to
   "follow Christ."

   Character and Aim of the Gospel.

   The first Gospel makes the impression of primitive antiquity. The city
   of Jerusalem, the temple, the priesthood and sacrifices, the entire
   religious and political fabric of Judaism are supposed to be still
   standing, but with an intimation of their speedy downfall. [910] It
   alone reports the words of Christ that he came not to destroy but to
   fulfil the law and the prophets, and that he was only sent to the lost
   sheep of the house of Israel. [911] Hence the best critics put the
   composition several years before the destruction of Jerusalem. [912]

   Matthew's Gospel was evidently written for Hebrews, and Hebrew
   Christians with the aim to prove that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised
   Messiah, the last and greatest prophet, priest, and king of Israel. It
   presupposes a knowledge of Jewish customs and Palestinian localities
   (which are explained in other Gospels). [913] It is the connecting link
   between the Old and the New Covenant. It is, as has been well said,
   [914] "the ultimatum of Jehovah to his ancient people: Believe, or
   prepare to perish! Recognize Jesus as the Messiah, or await Him as your
   Judge!" Hence he so often points out the fulfilment of Messianic
   prophecy in the evangelical history with his peculiar formula: "that it
   might be fulfilled," or "then was fulfilled." [915]

   In accordance with this plan, Matthew begins with the genealogy of
   Jesus, showing him to be the son and heir of David the king, and of
   Abraham the father, of the Jewish race, to whom the promises were
   given. The wise men of the East come from a distance to adore the
   new-born king of the Jews. The dark suspicion and jealousy of Herod is
   roused, and foreshadows the future persecution of the Messiah. The
   flight to Egypt and the return from that land both of refuge and
   bondage are a fulfilment of the typical history of Israel. John the
   Baptist completes the mission of prophecy in preparing the way for
   Christ. After the Messianic inauguration and trial Jesus opens his
   public ministry with the Sermon on the Mount, which is the counterpart
   of the Sinaitic legislation, and contains the fundamental law of his
   kingdom. The key-note of this sermon and of the whole Gospel is that
   Christ came to fulfil the law and the prophets, which implies both the
   harmony of the two religions and the transcendent superiority of
   Christianity. His mission assumes an organized institutional form in
   the kingdom of heaven which he came to establish in the world. Matthew
   uses this term (he basileia ton ouranon) no less than thirty-two times,
   while the other Evangelists and Paul speak of the "kingdom of God" (he
   basileia tou theou). No other Evangelist has so fully developed the
   idea that Christ and his kingdom are the fulfilment of all the hopes
   and aspirations of Israel, and so vividly set forth the awful solemnity
   of the crisis at this turning point in its history.

   But while Matthew wrote from the Jewish Christian point of view, he is
   far from being Judaizing or contracted. He takes the widest range of
   prophecy. He is the most national and yet the most universal, the most
   retrospective and yet the most prospective, of Evangelists. At the very
   cradle of the infant Jesus he introduces the adoring Magi from the far
   East, as the forerunners of a multitude of believing Gentiles who
   "shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;" while "the sons
   of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness." The
   heathen centurion, and the heathen woman of Canaan exhibit a faith the
   like of which Jesus did not find in Israel. The Messiah is rejected and
   persecuted by his own people in Galilee and Judaea. He upbraids
   Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, wherein his mighty works were done,
   because they repented not; He sheds tears over Jerusalem because she
   would not come to Him; He pronounces his woe over the Jewish hierarchy,
   and utters the fearful prophecies of the destruction of the theocracy.
   All this is most fully recorded by Matthew, and he most appropriately
   and sublimely concludes with the command of the universal
   evangelization of all nations, and the promise of the unbroken presence
   of Christ with his people to the end of the world. [916]

   Topical Arrangement.

   The mode of arrangement is clear and orderly. It is topical rather than
   chronological. It far surpasses Mark and Luke in the fulness of the
   discourses of Christ, while it has to be supplemented from them in
   regard to the succession of events. Matthew groups together the kindred
   words and works with special reference to Christ's teaching; hence it
   was properly called by Papias a collection of the Oracles of the Lord.
   It is emphatically the didactic Gospel.

   The first didactic group is the Sermon on the Mount of Beatitudes,
   which contains the legislation of the kingdom of Christ and an
   invitation to the whole people to enter, holding out the richest
   promises to the poor in spirit and the pure in heart (Matt. 5-7. The
   second group is the instruction to the disciples in their missionary
   work (Matt. 10). The third is the collection of the parables on the
   kingdom of God, illustrating its growth, conflict, value, and
   consummation (Matt. 13). The fourth, the denunciation of the Pharisees
   (Matt. 23), and the fifth, the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem
   and the end of the world (Matt. 24 and 25).

   Between these chief groups are inserted smaller discourses of Christ,
   on his relation to John the Baptist (11:1-19); the woe on the
   unrepenting cities of Galilee (11:20-24); the thanksgiving for the
   revelation to those of a childlike spirit (11:25-27); the invitation to
   the weary and heavy laden (11:28-30); on the observance of the Sabbath
   and warning to the Pharisees who were on the way to commit the
   unpardonable sin by tracing his miracles to Satanic powers (Matt. 12);
   the attack on the traditions of the elders and the hypocrisy of the
   Pharisees (Matt. 15 and 16); the prophecy of the founding of the church
   after the great confession of Peter, with the prediction of his passion
   as the way to victory (Matt. 16); the discourse on the little children
   with their lesson of simplicity and humility against the temptations of
   hierarchial pride; the duty of forgiveness in the kingdom and the
   parable of the unforgiving servant (Matt. 18); the discourse about
   divorce, against the Pharisees; the blessing of little children; the
   warning against the danger of riches; the parable of the Laborers in
   the Vineyard and the nature of the future rewards (Matt. 19 and 20);
   the victorious replies of the Lord to the tempting questions of the
   Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 22).

   These discourses are connected with narratives of the great miracles of
   Christ and the events in his life. The miracles are likewise grouped
   together (as in Matt. 8-9), or briefly summed up (as in 4:23-25). The
   transfiguration (Matt. 17) forms the turning-point between the active
   and the passive life; it was a manifestation of heaven on earth, an
   anticipation of Christ's future glory, a pledge of the resurrection,
   and it fortified Jesus and his three chosen disciples for the coming
   crisis, which culminated in the crucifixion and ended in the
   resurrection. [917]

   Peculiar Sections.

   Matthew has a number of original sections:

   1. Ten Discourses of our Lord, namely, the greater part of the Sermon
   on the Mount (Matt. 5-7); the thanksgiving for the revelation to babes
   (11:25-27); the touching invitation to the heavy laden (11:28-30),
   which is equal to anything in John; the warning against idle words
   (12:36, 37); the blessing pronounced upon Peter and the prophecy of
   founding the church (16:17-19); the greater part of the discourse on
   humility and forgiveness (Matt. 18); the rejection of the Jews (21:43);
   the denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 23); the
   description of the final judgment (25:31-46); the great commission and
   the promise of Christ's presence to the end of time (28:18-20).

   2. Ten Parables: the tares; the hidden treasure; the pearl of great
   price; the draw-net (13:24-50); the unmerciful servant (18:23-35); the
   laborers in the vineyard (20:1-16); the two sons (21:28-32); the
   marriage of the king's son (22: 1-14); the ten virgins (25:1-13); the
   talents (25:14-30).

   3. Two Miracles: the cure of two blind men (9:27-31); the stater in the
   fish's mouth (17:24-27).

   4. Facts and Incidents: the adoration of the Magi; the massacre of the
   innocents; the flight into Egypt; the return from Egypt to Nazareth
   (all in Matt. 2); the coming of the Pharisees and Sadducees to John's
   baptism (3:7); Peter's attempt to walk on the sea (14:28-31); the
   payment of the temple tax (17:24-27); the bargain of Judas, his
   remorse, and suicide (26:14-16; 27:3-10); the dream of Pilate's wife
   (27:19); the appearance of departed saints in Jerusalem (27:52); the
   watch at the sepulchre (27:62-66); the lie of the Sanhedrin and the
   bribing of the soldiers (28:11-15); the earthquake on the resurrection
   morning (28:2, a repetition of the shock described in 27:51, and
   connected with the rolling away of the stone from the sepulchre).

   The Style.

   The Style of Matthew is simple, unadorned, calm, dignified, even
   majestic; less vivid and picturesque than that of Mark; more even and
   uniform than Luke's, because not dependent on written sources. He is
   Hebraizing, but less so than Mark, and not so much as Luke 1-2. He
   omits some minor details which escaped his observation, but which Mark
   heard from Peter, and which Luke learned from eye-witnesses or found in
   his fragmentary documents. Among his peculiar expressions, besides the
   constant use of "kingdom of heaven," is the designation of God as "our
   heavenly Father," and of Jerusalem as "the holy city" and "the city of
   the Great King." In the fulness of the teaching of Christ he surpasses
   all except John. Nothing can be more solemn and impressive than his
   reports of those words of life and power, which will outlast heaven and
   earth (24:34). Sentence follows sentence with overwhelming force, like
   a succession of lightning flashes from the upper world. [918]

   Patristic Notices of Matthew.

   The first Gospel was well known to the author of the "Didache of the
   Apostles," who wrote between 80 and 100, and made large use of it,
   especially the Sermon on the Mount. [919]

   The next clear allusion to this Gospel is made in the Epistle of
   Barnabas, who quotes two passages from the Greek Matthew, one from
   22:14: "Many are called, but few chosen," with the significant formula
   used only of inspired writings, "It is written." [920] This shows
   clearly that early in the second century, if not before, it was an
   acknowledged authority in the church. The Gospel of John also
   indirectly presupposes, by its numerous emissions, the existence of all
   the Synoptical Gospels.

   The Hebrew Matthew.

   Next we hear of a Hebrew Matthew from Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, "a
   hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp." [921] He collected from
   apostles and their disciples a variety of apostolic traditions in his
   "Exposition of Oracles of the Lord," in five books (logion kuriakon
   exegesis].In a fragment of this lost work preserved by Eusebius, he
   says distinctly that "Matthew composed the oracles [of the Lord] in the
   Hebrew tongue, and everyone interpreted them as best he could." [922]

   Unfortunately the Hebrew Matthew, if it ever existed, has disappeared,
   and consequently there is much difference of opinion about this famous
   passage, both as regards the proper meaning of "oracles" (logia) and
   the truth of the whole report.

   1. The "oracles" are understood by some to mean only the discourses of
   our Lord; [923] by others to include also the narrative portions. [924]
   But in any case the Hebrew Matthew must have been chiefly an orderly
   collection of discourses. This agrees best with the natural and usual
   meaning of Logia, and the actual preponderance of the doctrinal element
   in our canonical Matthew) as compared with our Mark. A parte potiori
   fit denominatio.

   2. The report of a Hebrew original has been set aside altogether as a
   sheer mistake of Papias, who confounded it with the Ebionite "Gospel
   according to the Hebrews," known to us from a number of fragments.
   [925] It is said that Papias was a credulous and weak-minded, though
   pious man. [926] But this does not impair his veracity or invalidate a
   simple historical notice. It is also said that the universal spread of
   the Greek language made a Hebrew Gospel superfluous. But the Aramaic
   was still the vernacular and prevailing language in Palestine (comp.
   Acts 21:40; 22:2) and in the countries of the Euphrates.

   There is an intrinsic probability of a Hebrew Gospel for the early
   stage of Christianity. And the existence of a Hebrew Matthew rests by
   no means merely on Papias. It is confirmed by the independent
   testimonies of most respectable fathers, as Irenaeus, [927] Pantaenus,
   [928] Origen, [929] Eusebius, [930] Cyril of Jerusalem, [931]
   Epiphanius, [932] and Jerome. [933]

   This Hebrew Matthew must not be identified with the Judaizing "Gospel
   according to the Hebrews," the best among the apocryphal Gospels, of
   which in all thirty-three fragments remain. Jerome and other fathers
   clearly distinguish the two. The latter was probably an adaptation of
   the former to the use of the Ebionites and Nazarenes. [934] Truth
   always precedes heresy, as the genuine coin precedes the counterfeit,
   and the real portrait the caricature. Cureton and Tregelles maintain
   that the Curetonian Syriac fragment is virtually a translation of the
   Hebrew Matthew, and antedates the Peshito version. But Ewald has proven
   that it is derived from our Greek Matthew. [935]

   Papias says that everybody "interpreted" the Hebrew Matthew as well as
   he could. He refers no doubt to the use of the Gospel in public
   discourses before Greek hearers, not to a number of written
   translations of which we know nothing. The past tense (ermeneuse)
   moreover seems to imply that such necessity existed no longer at the
   time when he wrote; in other words, that the authentic Greek Matthew
   had since appeared and superseded the Aramaic predecessor which was
   probably less complete. [936] Papias accordingly is an indirect witness
   of the Greek Matthew in his own age; that is, the early part of the
   second century (about a.d. 130). At all events the Greek Matthew was in
   public use even before that time, as is evident from the, quotations in
   the Didache, and the Epistle of Barnabas (which were written before
   120, probably before 100).

   The Greek Matthew.

   The Greek Matthew, as we have it now, is not a close translation from
   the Hebrew and bears the marks of an original composition. This appears
   from genuine Greek words and phrases to which there is no parallel in
   Hebrew, as the truly classical "Those wretches he will wretchedly
   destroy," [937] and from the discrimination in Old Testament quotations
   which are freely taken from the Septuagint in the course of the
   narrative, but conformed to the Hebrew when they convey Messianic
   prophecies, and are introduced by the solemn formula: "that there might
   be fulfilled," or "then was fulfilled." [938]

   If then we credit the well nigh unanimous tradition of the ancient
   church concerning a prior Hebrew Matthew, we must either ascribe the
   Greek Matthew to some unknown translator who took certain liberties
   with the original, [939] or, what seems most probable, we must assume
   that Matthew himself at different periods of his life wrote his Gospel
   first in Hebrew in Palestine, and afterward in Greek. [940] In doing
   so, he would not literally translate his own book, but like other
   historians freely reproduce and improve it. Josephus did the same with
   his history of the Jewish war, of which only the Greek remains. When
   the Greek Matthew once was current in the church, it naturally
   superseded the Hebrew, especially if it was more complete.

   Objections are raised to Matthew's authorship of the first canonical
   Gospel, from real or supposed inaccuracies in the narrative, but they
   are at best very trifling and easily explained by the fact that Matthew
   paid most attention to the words of Christ, and probably had a better
   memory for thoughts than for facts. [941]

   But whatever be the view we take of the precise origin of the first
   canonical Gospel, it was universally received in the ancient church as
   the work of Matthew. It was our Matthew who is often, though freely,
   quoted by Justin Martyr as early as a.d. 146 among the "Gospel
   Memoirs;" it was one of the four Gospels of which his pupil Tatian
   compiled a connected "Diatessaron;" and it was the only Matthew used by
   Irenaeus and all the fathers that follow.

   [902] Maththaios, Matt. 9:9 (according to the spelling of ' B* D,
   adopted by Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort), or
   Matthaios(as spelled in the text. rec.), like Matthias and Mattathias,
   means Gift Jehovah ( hytm , hyntm, y'tm, ytm ), and corresponds to the
   Greek Theodore. He perhaps took this name after his call; his former
   name being Levi, Leuis, Leueis ( vyl , a joining), according to Mark
   2:12; Luke 5:27, 29. The new name overshadowed the old, as the names of
   Peter and Paul replaced Simon and Saul. The identity is evident from
   the fact that the call of Matthew or Levi is related by the three
   Synoptists in the same terms and followed by the same discourse.
   Nicholson (Com. on Matt. 9:9) disputes the identity, as Grotius and
   Sieffert did before, but on insufficient grounds. Before Mark 3:16
   Peter is called by his former name Simon (Mark 1:16, 29, 30, 36), and
   thereby shows his historical tact.

   [903] Hence called Maththaios ho telones ,Matt. 10:3. He inserts his
   previous employment to intimate the power of divine grace in his
   conversion.

   [904] Matt. 10:3, compared with Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15. But in the list
   in Acts 1:13 he is associated with Bartholomew, and Thomas with Philip.

   [905] Clement of Alexandria represents him as a strict Jewish Christian
   who abstained from the use of flesh. This would make him one of the
   weak brethren whom Paul (Rom. 14:1sqq.) charitably judges. But there is
   nothing in the first Gospel to justify this tradition.

   [906] The priority and relative superiority of Matthew are maintained
   not only by Augustin and the catholic tradition, but also by moderately
   liberal critics from Griesbach to Bleek, and even by the radical
   critics of the Tübingen school (Baur, Strauss, Schwegler, Zeller,
   Hilgenfeld, Davidson), and especially by Keim..

   [907] So Luke 5:29. Mark 2:15 ("many publicans and sinners sat down
   with Jesus and his disciples") and Matt. 9:10 ("many publicans and
   sinners") agree; but Matthew modestly omits his own name in connection
   with that feast. Some commentators understand "the house" to be the
   house of Jesus, but Jesus had no house and gave no dinner parties. Luke
   says expressly that it was the house of Levi.

   [908] Carr, Com., p. 6.

   [909] Luke 5:28; Mark 2:14; Matt. 9:9.

   [910] Matt. 5:35 (" Jerusalem is the city of the great king"); 23:1
   (sit on Moses' seat") 23:16 (" swear by the temple"); 16:28; 24:15 ("
   in the holy place;" " let him that readeth understand"), and the whole
   twenty-fourth chapter.

   [911] Matt. 5:17; 15:24; comp. 10:6.

   [912] Hug, Bleek, Olshausen, Ebrard, Meyer, Reim, Lange, and most
   commentators fix the date between 60 and 69, other writers as early as
   37-45 (but in conflict with Matt. 27:8; 28:15). Baur's view, which
   brings the Greek Matthew down to the second destruction of Jerusalem
   under Hadrian, 130-134, is exploded. Even Volkmar puts it much earlier
   (105 to 115), Hilgenfeld (Einleitung in das N. T., p. 497) immediately
   after the destruction of Jerusalem, Keim a.d. 66. Dr. Samuel Davidson,
   in the second ed. of his Introd. to the N. T. (London, 1882, vol. I.
   413-416), assigns the present Greek Matthew with Volkmar to 105, but
   assumes an Aramaean original and Greek paraphrases of the same which
   were written before the destruction of Jerusalem. He thinks that "the
   eschatological discourses which connect the fail of Jerusalem, the
   destruction of the temple and the end of the world, have been falsified
   by history" (?); that consequently Jesus did not utter them as they are
   recorded, but they were revised and altered by writers who incorporated
   with them Jewish ideas and expressions (I. 403).

   [913] Comp. Matt. 15:2 with Mark 7:3, 4. The translation of the
   exclamation on the cross, Matt. 27:46, is intended for Greek Jews,

   [914] By Godet, Studies on the New Testament, p. 23.

   [915] hina (or hopos)plerothe to rethen, ortote eplerothe to rethen.
   This formula occurs twelve times in Matthew (1:22; 2:15, 17, 23; 4:14;
   8:17; 12:17, 13:35; 21:4; 26:56; 27:9, 35), six times in John, but
   nowhere in Luke nor in Mark; for Mark 15:28 (kai eplerothe he graphe k.
   t. l.) in the text. rec. is spurious and probably inserted from Luke
   22:37.

   [916] Comp. Matt. 2:1-12; 8:11, 12; 11:21; 12:41; 15:21-28; Matt. 23
   and 24; 28:19, 20.

   [917] For a full analysis see the critical monograph of Weiss, and
   Lange's Matth., pp. 43-46. Keim, who builds his Geschichte Jesu--the
   ablest and least objectionable of the purely critical biographies of
   Christ,--chiefly on Matthew, praises its plan as sorgfältig, einfach
   und einleuchtend, durchsichtig und sehr wohl durchgeführt (I. 52). He
   divides it into two chief sections: the entry upon the public ministry
   with the Bussruf and Reichspredigt (4:17: apo tote erxato ho Iesous
   kerussein, k. t. l.), and the entry upon the path of death with the
   Leidensruf and the Zukunftspredigt (Matt16:21: apo tote erxato ho Ies.,
   k. t. l.). He also finds an ingenious symmetry of numbers in the
   collocation of 10 miracles, 8 [7] beatitudes, 7 woes, 4 and 3 parables,
   3 temptations, etc.

   [920] Ep. Barn., c. 4, at the close:prosechomen, mepote, hos gegraptai,
   polloi kletoi, oligoi de eklektoi heurethomen. Since the discovery of
   the entire Greek text of this Epistle in the Codex Sinaiticus (1859),
   where it follows the Apocalypse, there can be no doubt any more about
   the formula gegraptai(scriptum est). The other passage quoted in Matt.
   5 is from Matt. 9:13: ouk helthen kalesai dikaious alla hamartolous.
   The Ep. of Barnabas dates from the close of the first or the beginning
   of the second century. Some place it as early as a.d. 70, others an
   late as 120. The Didache is older.

   [921] Euseb., H. E., III. 39: Ioannou men akoustes,Polukarpou de
   hetairos gegonos.. Whether this " John" is the apostle or the
   mysterious " Presbyter John," is a matter of dispute which will be
   discussed in the second volume in the section on Papias. Eusebius
   himself clearly distinguishes two Johns. The date of Papias must be set
   back several years with that of Polycarp, his " companion," who
   suffered martyrdom in 155 (not 164). The Chronicon Paschale which
   represents Papias as martyred at Pergamum about the same time, mistook
   PAPULOS in Eusebius, H. E., IV. 15 (at the close), for PAPIAS. See
   Lightfoot, " Contemp. Review" for August, 1875, p. 381 sqq.

   [922] Eus., Hist. Eccl., III. 39: Matthaios men houn Hebraidi dialek'to
   ta logia sunataxato (or, according to the reading of Heinichen, I. 150,
   sunagrapsato), ermeneuse d' auta hos hen dunatos hekastos . This
   testimony has been thoroughly discussed by Schleiermacher (in the
   "Studien und Kritiken," 1832), Holtzmann (Synopt. Evang., 248 sqq.),
   Weizsäcker (Untersuchungen üb. d. ev. Gesch., 27 sqq.). Ewald
   (Jahrbücher, VI., 55 sqq.), Zahn (in "Stud. u. Kritiken," 1866, 649
   sqq.), Steitz (ibid., 1868, 63 sqq.), Keim (Gesch. Jesu v. Naz., I., 56
   sqq.), Meyer (Com. Evang. Matth., 6th ed. (1876), 4 sqq.), Lightfoot
   (in "Contemp. Review" for August, 1875, pp. 396-403), and Weiss (Das
   Matthäusevang., 1876, 1 sqq.).

   [923] So Schleiermacher who first critically examined this passage
   (1832), Schneckenbarger (1834), Lachmann (1835), Credner, Wieseler.
   Ewald, Reuss, Weizsäcker, Holtzmann, Meyer (p. 11). It is supposed that
   Matthew's Hebrew Gospel was similar to the lost work of Papias, with
   this difference that the former was simply a collection (suntaxis or
   sungraphe), the latter an interpretation (exegesis), of the Lord's
   discourses (ton logion kuriakon).

   [924] So Lücke (1833), Kern, Hug, Harless, Anger, Bleek, Baur,
   Hilgenfeld, Lange, Ebrard, Thiersch, Keim, Zahn, Lightfoot, Thomson,
   Keil, Weiss (but the last with a limitation to a meagre thread of
   narrative). The chief arguments are: 1, that all early writers, from
   Irenaeus onward, who speak of a Hebrew Matthew mean a regular Gospel
   corresponding to our Greek Matthew; 2, the parallel passage of Papias
   concerning the Gospel of Mark (Eus., III. 39), where apparently "the
   Lord's discourses" (logoi kuriakoi) includes actions as well as words.
   ta hupo tou Christou he lechthenta he prachthenta. But it is said
   somewhat disparagingly, that Mark (as compared with Matthew) did not
   give "an orderly arrangement of the Lord's words" (ouch hosper suntaxin
   ton kuriakon poioumenos logon). The wider meaning of logia is supported
   by Rom. 3:1, where ta logia tou theou, with which the Jews were
   intrusted, includes the whole Old Testament Scriptures; and Hebr. 5:12,
   " the first principles of the oracles of God". (ta stoicheia -ite-is
   arches ton logion tou theou). Lightfoot quotes also passages from
   Philo, Clement of Rome, Polycarp, and Origen (l.c., p. 400 sq.).

   [925] So Wetstein, Hug, De Wette, Bleek, Ewald, Ritschl, Holtzmann,
   Keim, Delitzsch, Keil. Some of these writers assume that the Gospel
   according to the Hebrews was an Ebionite translation and recension of
   the Greek Matthew. So Delitzsch and Keil (Com. p. 23). Keim is mistaken
   when he asserts (I. 54) that scarcely anybody nowadays believes in a
   Hebrew Matthew. The contrary opinion is defended by Meyer, Weiss, and
   others, and prevails among English divines.

   [926] Eusebius (III. 39) calls him sphodra smikros ton noun, " very
   narrow-minded," but on account of his millenarianism, as the context
   shows. In another place he calls him a man of comprehensive learning
   and great knowledge of the Scriptures (III. 39: ta tanta malista
   logiotatos kai tes graphes eidemon ).

   [927] Adv. Haer., III1, 1: ho men` de Matthaios en tois Ebraiois te
   idia dialekto auton kai graphen exenenken euangeliou, tou Petrou kai
   Paulou en Rh ome euangelizomenon kai themeliounton ten ekklesian. The
   chronological reference is so far inaccurate, as neither Peter nor Paul
   were personally the founders of the church of Rome, yet it was founded
   through their influence and their pupils, and consolidated by their
   presence and martyrdom.

   [928] He is reported by Eus., H.E. 10, to have found in India (probably
   in Southern Arabia) the Gospel according to Matthew in Hebrew (Hebraion
   grammasi), which had been left there by Bartholomew, one of the
   apostles. This testimony is certainly independent of Papias. But it may
   be questioned whether a Hebrew original, or a Hebrew translation, is
   meant.

   [929] In Eus., H. E., VI. 25. Origen, however, drew his report of a
   Hebrew Matthew not from personal knowledge, but from tradition (hos en
   paradosei mathon).

   [930] H. E., III. 24: Matthaios men gar proteron Hebraiois keruxas, hos
   emelle kai eph heterous ienai, patrio glotte graphe paradous to kat
   auton euangelion, to leipon te autou parousia toutois, aph' hon
   estelleto, dia tes ; graphes apeplerou. " M., having first preached the
   Gospel in Hebrew, when on the point of going also to other nations,
   committed it to writing in his native tongue, and thus supplied the
   want of his presence to them by his book."

   [931] Catech. 14: Matth. ho grapsas to euangelion Hebraidi glosse.

   [932] Haer., XXX. 3; comp. LI. 5.

   [933] Praef. in Matth.; on Matt. 12:13; Dial. c Pelag., III, c. 2; De
   Vir. illustr., c. 2 and 3. Jerome's testimony is somewhat conflicting.
   He received a copy of the Hebrew M. from the Nazarenes in Beraea in
   Syria for transcription (392). But afterward (415) he seems to have
   found out that the supposed Hebrew Matthew in the library of Pamphilus
   at Caesarea was "the Gospel according to the Hebrews" (Evangelium
   juxta, or secundum Hebraeos), which he translated both into Greek and
   Latin (De vir. ill., c. 2). This would have been useless, if the Hebrew
   Gospel had been only the original of the canonical Matthew. See Weiss,
   l.c., pp. 7 sq.

   [934] The fragments of this Gospel ("quo utuntur Nazareni et
   Ebionitae," Jerome) were collected by Credner, Beiträge, I. 380 sqq.;
   Hilgenfeld, Nov. Test. extra can. rec., IV., and especially by
   Nicholson in the work quoted above. It is far superior to the other
   apocryphal Gospels, and was so much like the Hebrew Matthew that many
   confounded it with the same, as Jerome observes, ad Matth. 12:13 ("quod
   vocatur a plerisque Matthaei authenticum") and C. Pelag., III. 2. The
   Tübingen view (Baur, Schwegler, Hilgenfeld) reverses the natural order
   and makes this heretical gospel the Urmatthaeus (proto-Matthew), of
   which our Greek Matthew is an orthodox transformation made as late as
   130; but Keim (I., 29 sqq.), Meyer (p. 19), and Weise (pp. 8 and 9)
   have sufficiently refuted this hypothesis. Nicholson modifies the
   Tübingen theory by assuming that Matthew wrote at different times the
   canonical Gospel and those portions of the Gospel according to the
   Hebrews, which run parallel with it.

   [935] See Holtzmann, p. 269, and Ewald's "Jahrbücher," IX. 69 sqq.

   [936] So Meyer (p. 12, against Holtzmann), and Lightfoot (p. 397
   against the author of "Supern. Rel."). Schleiermacher was wrong in
   referring hermeneuse to narrative additions.

   [937] Matt. 21:41: kakous kakos apolesei, pessimos pessime (or malos
   male) perdet. The E. Revision reproduces the paronomasis (which is
   obliterated in the E. V.) thus: "He will miserably destroy those
   miserable men." Other plays on words: Petros and petra, 16:18;
   battologein and polulogia , 6:7; aphanizousin hopos phanosi, "they make
   their faces unappearable (disfigure them), that they may appear,"6:16;
   comp. 24:7. Weiss derives the originality of the Greek Matthew from the
   use of the Greek Mark; but this would not account for these and similar
   passages.

   [938] Jerome first observed that Matthew follows not Septuaginta
   translatorum auctoritatem, sed Hebraicam (De vir. illustr., c. 3).
   Credner and Bleek brought out this important difference more fully, and
   Holtzmann (Die Syn. Evang., p. 259), Ritschl, Köstlin, Keim (I., 59
   sqq), Meyer (p. 9), and Weiss (p. 44) confirm it. But Hilgenfeld and
   Keim unnecessarily see in this fact an indication of a later editor,
   who exists only in their critical fancy.

   [939] Jerome acknowledges the uncertainty of the translator, De vir.
   ill., c. 3: Quis postea in Graecum transtulerit [the Hebrew Matthew],
   non satis certum est." It has been variously traced to James, the
   brother of the Lord Synops. Pseudo-Athan.), to a disciple of Matthew,
   or to another disciple.

   [940] So Bengel, Guericke, Schott, Olshausen, Thiersch.

   [941] Meyer and Weiss regard the reports of the resurrection of the
   dead at the crucifixion and the story of the watch, Matt. 27:52, 62-66,
   as post-apostolic legends; but the former is not more difficult than
   the resurrection of Lazarus, and the latter has all the marks of
   intrinsic probability. Meyer also gratuitously assumes that Matthew
   must be corrected from John on the date of the crucifixion; but there
   is no real contradiction between the Synoptic and the Johannean date.
   See p. 133. Meyer's opinion is that Matthew wrote only a Hebrew
   collection of the discourses of our Lord, that an unknown hand at an
   early date added the narrative portions, and another anonymous writer,
   before the year 70, made the Greek translation which was universally
   and justly, as far as substance is concerned, regarded as Matthew's
   work (pp. 14, 23). But these are an pure conjectures.

   Life of Mark

   The second Evangelist combines in his name, as well as in his mission,
   the Hebrew and the Roman, and is a connecting link between Peter and
   Paul, but more especially a pupil and companion of the former, so that
   his Gospel may properly be called the Gospel of Peter. His original
   name was John or Johanan (i.e., Jehovah is gracious, Gotthold) his
   surname was Mark (i.e., Mallet). [942] The surname supplanted the
   Hebrew name in his later life, as Peter supplanted Simon, and Paul
   supplanted Saul. The change marked the transition of Christianity from
   the Jews to the Gentiles. He is frequently mentioned in the Acts and
   the Epistles. [943]

   He was the son of a certain Mary who lived at Jerusalem and offered her
   house, at great risk no doubt in that critical period of persecution,
   to the Christian disciples for devotional meetings. Peter repaired to
   that house after his deliverance from prison (a.d. 44). This accounts
   for the close intimacy of Mark with Peter; he was probably converted
   through him, and hence called his spiritual "son" (1 Pet. 5:13). [944]
   He may have had a superficial acquaintance with Christ; for he is
   probably identical with that unnamed "young man" who, according to his
   own report, left his "linen cloth and fled naked" from Gethsemane in
   the night of betrayal (Mark 14:51). He would hardly have mentioned such
   a trifling incident, unless it had a special significance for him as
   the turning-point in his life. Lange ingeniously conjectures that his
   mother owned the garden of Gethsemane or a house close by.

   Mark accompanied Paul and Barnabas as their minister (huperetes) on
   their first great missionary journey; but left them half-way, being
   discouraged, it seems, by the arduous work, and returned to his mother
   in Jerusalem. For this reason Paul refused to take him on his next
   tour, while Barnabas was willing to overlook his temporary weakness
   (Acts 15:38). There was a "sharp contention" on that occasion between
   these good men, probably in connection with the more serious collision
   between Paul and Peter at Antioch (Gal. 2:11 sqq.). Paul was moved by a
   stern sense of duty; Barnabas by a kindly feeling for his cousin. [945]
   But the alienation was only temporary. For about ten years afterwards
   (63) Paul speaks of Mark at Rome as one of his few "fellow-workers unto
   the kingdom of God," who had been "a comfort" to him in his
   imprisonment; and he commends him to the brethren in Asia Minor on his
   intended visit (Col. 4:10, 11; Philem. 24). In his last Epistle he
   charges Timothy to bring Mark with him to Rome on the ground that he
   was "useful to him for ministering" (2 Tim. 4:11). We find him again in
   company with Peter at "Baby]on," whether that be on the Euphrates, or,
   more probably, at Rome (1 Pet. 5:3).

   These are the last notices of him in the New Testament. The tradition
   of the church adds two important facts, that he wrote his Gospel in
   Rome as the interpreter of Peter, and that afterwards he founded the
   church of Alexandria. The Coptic patriarch claims to be his successor.
   The legends of his martyrdom in the eighth year of Nero (this date is
   given by Jerome) are worthless. In 827 his relics were removed from
   Egypt to Venice, which built him a magnificent five-domed cathedral on
   the Place of St. Mark, near the Doge's palace, and chose him with his
   symbol, the Lion, for the patron saint of the republic.

   His Relation to Peter.

   Though not an apostle, Mark had the best opportunity in his mother's
   house and his personal connection with Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and other
   prominent disciples for gathering the most authentic information
   concerning the gospel history.

   The earliest notice of his Gospel we have from Papias of Hierapolis in
   the first half of the second century. He reports among the primitive
   traditions which he collected, that "Mark, having become the
   interpreter of Peter (hermeneutes Petrou genomenos], orote doon
   achchuratelps [akribos egrapsen) whatever he remembered, [946] without,
   however, recording in order (taxei) what was either said or done by
   Christ. For neither did he hear the Lord, nor did he follow Him; but
   afterwards, as I said, [he followed] Peter, who adapted his
   instructions to the needs [of his hearers], but not in the way of
   giving a connected account of the Lord's discourses. [947] So then Mark
   committed no error in thus writing down such details as he remembered;
   for he made it his one forethought not to omit or to misrepresent any
   details that he had heard." [948]

   In what sense was Mark an "interpreter" of Peter? Not as the translator
   of a written Aramaic Gospel of Peter into the Greek, for of such an
   Aramaic original there is no trace, and Peter (to judge from his
   Epistles) wrote better Greek; nor as the translator of his discourses
   into Latin, for we know not whether he understood that language, and it
   was scarcely needed even in Rome among Jews and Orientals who spoke
   Greek; [949] nor in the wider sense, as a mere clerk or amanuensis, who
   wrote down what Peter dictated; but as the literary editor and
   publisher of the oral Gospel of his spiritual father and teacher. So
   Mercury was called the interpreter of the gods, because he communicated
   to mortals the messages of the gods. It is quite probable, however,
   that Peter sketched down some of the chief events under the first
   impression, in his vernacular tongue, and that such brief memoirs, if
   they existed, would naturally be made use of by Mark. [950]

   We learn, then, from Papias that Mark wrote his Gospel from the
   personal reminiscences of Peter's discourses, which were adapted to the
   immediate wants of his hearers; that it was not complete (especially in
   the didactic part, as compared with Matthew or John), nor strictly
   chronological.

   Clement of Alexandria informs us that the people of Rome were so much
   pleased with the preaching of Peter that they requested Mark, his
   attendant, to put it down in writing, which Peter neither encouraged
   nor hindered. Other ancient fathers emphasize the close intimacy of
   Mark with Peter, and call his Gospel the Gospel of Peter. [951]

   The Gospel.

   This tradition is confirmed by the book: it is derived from the
   apostolic preaching of Peter, but is the briefest and so far the least
   complete of all the Gospels, yet replete with significant details. It
   reflects the sanguine and impulsive temperament, rapid movement, and
   vigorous action of Peter. In this respect its favorite particle
   "straightway" is exceedingly characteristic. The break-down of Mark in
   Pamphylia, which provoked the censure of Paul, has a parallel in the
   denial and inconsistency of Peter; but, like him, he soon rallied, was
   ready to accompany Paul on his next mission, and persevered faithfully
   to the end.

   He betrays, by omissions and additions, the direct influence of Peter.
   He informs us that the house of Peter was "the house of Simon and
   Andrew" (Mark 1:29). He begins the public ministry of Christ with the
   calling of these two brothers (1:16) and ends the undoubted part of the
   Gospel with a message to Peter (16:7), and the supplement almost in the
   very words of Peter. [952] He tells us that Peter on the Mount of
   Transfiguration, when he proposed to erect three tabernacles, "knew not
   what to say" (9:6). He gives the most minute account of Peter's denial,
   and--alone among the Evangelists--records the fact that he warmed
   himself "in the light" of the fire so that he could be distinctly seen
   (14:54), and that the cock crew twice, giving him a second warning
   (14:72). No one would be more likely to remember and report the fact as
   a stimulus to humility and gratitude than Peter himself.

   On the other hand, Mark omits the laudatory words of Jesus to Peter:
   "Thou art Rock, and upon this rock I will build my church;" while yet
   he records the succeeding rebuke: "Get thee behind me, Satan." [953]
   The humility of the apostle, who himself warns so earnestly against the
   hierarchical abuse of the former passage, offers the most natural
   explanation of this conspicuous omission. "It is likely," says
   Eusebius, "that Peter maintained silence on these points; hence the
   silence of Mark." [954]

   Character and Aim of Mark.

   The second Gospel was--according to the unanimous voice of the ancient
   church, which is sustained by internal evidence--written at Rome and
   primarily for Roman readers, probably before the death of Peter, at all
   events before the destruction of Jerusalem. [955]

   It is a faithful record of Peter's preaching, which Mark must have
   heard again and again. It is an historical sermon on the text of Peter
   when addressing the Roman soldier Cornelius: "God anointed Jesus of
   Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing
   good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was
   with him." [956] It omits the history of the infancy, and rushes at
   once into the public ministry of our Lord, beginning, like Peter, with
   the baptism of John, and ending with the ascension. It represents
   Christ in the fulness of his living energy, as the Son of God and the
   mighty wonder-worker who excited amazement and carried the people
   irresistibly before him as a spiritual conqueror. This aspect would
   most impress the martial mind of the Romans, who were born to conquer
   and to rule. The teacher is lost in the founder of a kingdom. The
   heroic element prevails over the prophetic. The victory over Satanic
   powers in the healing of demoniacs is made very prominent. It is the
   gospel of divine force manifested in Christ. The symbol of the lion is
   not inappropriate to the Evangelist who describes Jesus as the Lion of
   the tribe of Judah. [957]

   Mark gives us a Gospel of facts, while Matthew's is a Gospel of divine
   oracles. He reports few discourses, but many miracles. He unrolls the
   short public life of our Lord in a series of brief life-pictures in
   rapid succession. He takes no time to explain and to reveal the inside.
   He dwells on the outward aspect of that wonderful personality as it
   struck the multitude. Compared with Matthew and especially with John,
   he is superficial, but not on that account incorrect or less useful and
   necessary. He takes the theocratic view of Christ, like Matthew; while
   Luke and John take the universal view; but while Matthew for his Jewish
   readers begins with the descent of Christ from David the King and often
   directs attention to the fulfilment of prophecy, Mark, writing for
   Gentiles, begins with "the Son of God" in his independent personality.
   [958] He rarely quotes prophecy; but, on the other hand, he translates
   for his Roman readers Aramaic words and Jewish customs and opinions.
   [959] He exhibits the Son of God in his mighty power and expects the
   reader to submit to his authority.

   Two miracles are peculiar to him, the healing of the deaf and dumb man
   in Decapolis, which astonished the people "beyond measure" and made
   them exclaim: "He hath done all things well: he maketh even the deaf to
   hear, and the dumb to speak" (Mark 7:31-37). The other miracle is a
   remarkable specimen of a gradual cure, the healing of the blind man at
   Bethsaida, who upon the first touch of Christ saw the men around him
   walking, but indistinctly as trees, and then after the second laying on
   of hands upon his eyes "saw all things clearly" (8:22-26). He omits
   important parables, but alone gives the interesting parable of the seed
   growing secretly and bearing first the blade, then the ear, then the
   full grain in the ear (4:26-29).

   It is an interesting feature to which Dr. Lange first has directed
   attention, that Mark lays emphasis on the periods of pause and rest
   which "rhythmically intervene between the several great victories
   achieved by Christ." He came out from his obscure abode in Nazareth;
   each fresh advance in his public life is preceded by a retirement, and
   each retirement is followed by a new and greater victory. The contrast
   between the contemplative rest and the vigorous action is striking and
   explains the overpowering effect by revealing its secret spring in the
   communion with God and with himself. Thus we have after his baptism a
   retirement to the wilderness in Judaea before he preached in Galilee
   (1:12); a retirement to the ship (3:7); to the desert on the eastern
   shore of the lake of Galilee (6:31); to a mountain (6:46); to the
   border land of Tyre and Sidon (7:24); to Decapolis (7:31); to a high
   mountain (9:2); to Bethany (11:1); to Gethsemane (14:34); his rest in
   the grave before the resurrection; and his withdrawal from the world
   and his reappearance in the victories of the gospel preached by his
   disciples. "The ascension of the Lord forms his last withdrawal, which
   is to be followed by his final onset and absolute victory." [960]

   Doctrinal Position.

   Mark has no distinct doctrinal type, but is catholic, irenic,
   unsectarian, and neutral as regards the party questions within the
   apostolic church. But this is not the result of calculation or of a
   tendency to obliterate and conciliate existing differences. [961] Mark
   simply represents the primitive form of Christianity itself before the
   circumcision controversy broke out which occasioned the apostolic
   conference at Jerusalem twenty years after the founding of the church.
   His Gospel is Petrine without being anti-Pauline, and Pauline without
   being anti-Petrine. Its doctrinal tone is the same as that of the
   sermons of Peter in the Acts. It is thoroughly practical. Its preaches
   Christianity, not theology.

   The same is true of the other Gospels, with this difference, however,
   that Matthew has a special reference to Jewish, Luke to Gentile
   readers, and that both make their selection accordingly under the
   guidance of the Spirit and in accordance with their peculiar charisma
   and aim, but without altering or coloring the facts. Mark stands
   properly between them just as Peter stood between James and Paul.

   The Style.

   The style of Mark is unclassical, inelegant, provincial, homely, poor
   and repetitious in vocabulary, but original, fresh, and picturesque,
   and enlivened by interesting touches and flickers.. [962]

   He was a stranger to the arts of rhetoric and unskilled in literary
   composition, but an attentive listener, a close observer, and faithful
   recorder of actual events. He is strongly Hebraizing, and uses often
   the Hebrew and, but seldom the argumentative for. He inserts a number
   of Latin words, though most of these occur also in Matthew and Luke,
   and in the Talmud. [963] He uses the particle "forthwith" or
   "straightway" more frequently than all the other Evangelists combined.
   [964] It is his pet word, and well expresses his haste and rapid
   transition from event to event, from conquest to conquest. He quotes
   names and phrases in the original Aramaic, as "Abba," "Boanerges,"
   "Talitha kum," "Corban," "Ephphathah," and "Eloi, Eloi," with a Greek
   translation. [965] He is fond of the historical present, [966] of the
   direct instead of the indirect mode of speech, [967] of pictorical
   participles, [968] and of affectionate diminutives. [969] He observes
   time and place of important events. [970] He has a number of peculiar
   expressions not found elsewhere in the New Testament. [971]

   Characteristic Details.

   Mark inserts many delicate tints and interesting incidents of persons
   and events which he must have heard from primitive witnesses. They are
   not the touches of fancy or the reflections of an historian, but the
   reminiscences of the first impressions. They occur in every chapter. He
   makes some little contribution to almost every narrative he has in
   common with Matthew and Luke. He notices the overpowering impression of
   awe and wonder, joy and delight, which the words and miracles of Jesus
   and his very appearance made upon the people and the disciples; [972]
   the actions of the multitude as they were rushing and thronging and
   pressing upon Him that He might touch and heal them, so that there was
   scarcely standing room, or time to eat. [973] On one occasion his
   kinsmen were about forcibly to remove Him from the throng. He directs
   attention to the human emotions and passions of our Lord, how he was
   stirred by pity, wonder, grief, anger and indignation. [974] He notices
   his attitudes, looks and gestures, [975] his sleep and hunger. [976]

   He informs us that Jesus, "looking upon" the rich young ruler, "loved
   him," and that the ruler's "countenance fell" when he was told to sell
   all he had and to follow Jesus. Mark, or Peter rather, must have
   watched the eye of our Lord and read in his face the expression of
   special interest in that man who notwithstanding his self-righteousness
   and worldliness had some lovely qualities and was not very far from the
   kingdom. [977]

   The cure of the demoniac and epileptic at the foot of the mount of
   transfiguration is narrated with greater circumstantiality and dramatic
   vividness by Mark than by the other Synoptists. He supplies the
   touching conversation of Jesus with the father of the sufferer, which
   drew out his weak and struggling faith with the earnest prayer for
   strong and victorious faith: "I believe; help Thou mine unbelief."
   [978] We can imagine how eagerly Peter, the confessor, caught this
   prayer, and how often he repeated it in his preaching, mindful of his
   own weakness and trials.

   All the Synoptists relate on two distinct occasions Christ's love for
   little children, but Mark alone tells us that He "took little children
   into his arms, and laid his hands upon them." [979]

   Many minor details not found in the other Gospels, however
   insignificant in themselves, are yet most significant as marks of the
   autopticity of the narrator (Peter). Such are the notices that Jesus
   entered the house of "Simon and Andrew, with James and John" (Mark
   1:29); that the Pharisees took counsel "with the Herodians" (3:6); that
   the raiment of Jesus at the transfiguration became exceeding white as
   snow "so as no fuller on earth can whiten them" (9:3); that blind
   Bartimaeus when called, "casting away his garment, leaped up" (10:50),
   and came to Jesus; that "Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
   privately" on the Mount of Olives about the coming events (13:3); that
   the five thousand sat down "in ranks, by hundreds and fifties" (6:40);
   that the Simon who carried the cross of Christ (15:21) was a "Cyrenian"
   and "the father of Alexander and Rufus" (no doubt, two well-known
   disciples, perhaps at Rome, comp. Rom. 16:13).

   We may add, as peculiar to Mark and "bewraying" Peter, the designation
   of Christ as "the carpenter" (Mark 6:3); the name of the blind beggar
   at Jericho, "Bartimaeus" (10:46); the "cushion" in the boat on which
   Jesus slept (4:38); the "green grass" on the hill side in spring time
   (4:39); the "one loaf" in the ship (8:14); the colt "tied at the door
   without in the open street" (11:4); the address to the daughter of
   Jairus in her mother tongue (5:41); the bilingual "Abba, Father," in
   the prayer at Gethsemane (14:36; comp. Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6).

   Conclusion.

   The natural conclusion from all these peculiarities is that Mark's
   Gospel, far from being an extract from Matthew or Luke or both, as
   formerly held, [980] is a thoroughly independent and original work, as
   has been proven by minute investigations of critics of different
   schools and aims. [981] It is in all its essential parts a fresh,
   life-like, and trustworthy record of the persons and events of the
   gospel history from the lips of honest old Peter and from the pen of
   his constant attendant and pupil. Jerome hit it in the fourth century,
   and unbiassed critics in the nineteenth century confirm it: Peter was
   the narrator, Mark the writer, of the second Gospel. [982]

   Some have gone further and maintain that Mark, "the interpreter of
   Peter," simply translated a Hebrew Gospel of his teacher; [983] but
   tradition knows nothing of a Hebrew Peter, while it speaks of a Hebrew
   Matthew; and a book is called after its author, not after its
   translator. It is enough to say Peter was the preacher, Mark the
   reporter and editor.

   The bearing of this fact upon the reliableness of the Synoptic record
   of the life of Christ is self-evident. It leaves no room for the
   mythical or legendary hypothesis. [984]

   Integrity of the Gospel.

   The Gospel closes (Mark 16:9-20) with a rapid sketch of the wonders of
   the resurrection and ascension, and the continued manifestations of
   power that attend the messengers of Christ in preaching the gospel to
   the whole creation. This close is upon the whole characteristic of Mark
   and presents the gospel as a divine power pervading and transforming
   the world, but it contains some peculiar features, namely: (1) one of
   the three distinct narratives of Christ's ascension (16:19, "he was
   received up into heaven;" the other two being those of Luke 24:51 and
   Acts 1:9-11), with the additional statement that he "sat down at the
   right hand of God" (comp. the similar statement, 1 Pet. 3:22) (2) an
   emphatic declaration of the necessity of baptism for salvation ("he
   that believeth and is baptized shall be saved"), with the negative
   clause that unbelief (i.e., the rejection of the gospel offer of
   salvation) condemns ("he that disbelieveth shall be condemned"); [985]
   (3) the fact that the apostles disbelieved the report of Mary Magdalene
   until the risen Lord appeared to them personally (Mark 16:11-14; but
   John intimates the same, John 20:8, 9, especially in regard to Thomas,
   20:25, and Matthew mentions that some doubted, Matt. 28:17; comp. Luke
   24:37-41); (4) an authoritative promise of supernatural powers and
   signs which shall accompany the believers (Mark 16:17, 18). Among these
   is mentioned the pentecostal glossolalia under the unique name of
   speaking with new tongues. [986]

   The genuineness of this closing section is hotly contested, and
   presents one of the most difficult problems of textual criticism. The
   arguments are almost equally strong on both sides, but although the
   section cannot be proven to be a part of the original Gospel, it seems
   clear: (1) that it belongs to primitive tradition (like the disputed
   section of the adulteress in John 8); and (2) that Mark cannot have
   closed his Gospel with Mark 16:8 (gar) without intending a more
   appropriate conclusion. The result does not affect the character and
   credibility of the Gospel. The section may be authentic or correct in
   its statements, without being genuine or written by Mark. There is
   nothing in it which, properly understood, does not harmonize with
   apostolic teaching.

   Note on the Disputed Close of Mark, 16:9-20

   I. Reasons against the genuineness:

   1. The section is wanting altogether in the two oldest and most
   valuable uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic (') and the Vatican (B). The
   latter, it is true, after ending the Gospel with Mark 16:8 and the
   subscription kata mapkon, leaves the remaining third column blank,
   which is sufficient space for the twelve verses. Much account is made
   of this fact by Drs. Burgon and Scrivener; but in the same MS. I find,
   on examination of the facsimile edition, blank spaces from a few lines
   up to two-thirds and three-fourths of a column, at the end of Matthew,
   John, Acts, 1 Pet. (fol. 200), 1 John (fol. 208), Jude (fol. 210), Rom.
   (fol. 227), Eph. (fol. 262), Col. (fol. 272). In the Old Testament of
   B, as Dr. Abbot has first noted (in 1872), there are two blank columns
   at the end of Nehemiah, and a blank column and a half at the end of
   Tobit. In any case the omission indicates an objection of the copyist
   of B to the section, or its absence in the earlier manuscript he used.

   I add the following private note from Dr. Abbot:, "In the Alexandrian
   MS. a column and a third are left blank at the end of Mark, half a page
   at the end of John, and a whole page at the end of the Pauline
   Epistles. (Contrast the ending of Matthew and Acts.) In the Old
   Testament, note especially in this MS. Leviticus, Isaiah, and the Ep.
   of Jeremiah, at the end of each of which half a page or more is left
   blank; contrast Jeremiah, Baruch, Lamentations. There are similar
   blanks at the end of Ruth, 2 Samuel, and Daniel, but the last leaf of
   those books ends a quaternion or quire in the MS. In the Sinaitic MS.
   more than two columns with the whole following page are left blank at
   the end of the Pauline Epistles, though the two next leaves belong to
   the same quaternion; so at the end of the Acts a column and two-thirds
   with the whole of the following page; and at the end of Barnabas a
   column and a half. These examples show that the matter in question
   depended largely on the whim of the copyist; and that we can not infer
   with confidence that the scribe of B knew of any other ending of the
   Gospel."

   There is also a shorter conclusion, unquestionably spurious, which in L
   and several MSS. of the Aethiopic version immediately follows Mark
   16:8, and appears also in the margin of 274, the Harclean Syriac, and
   the best Coptic MS. of the Gospel, while in k of the Old Latin it takes
   the place of the longer ending. For details, see Westcott and Hort,
   II., Append., pp. 30, 38, 44 sq.

   2. Eusebius and Jerome state expressly that the section was wanting in
   almost all the Greek copies of the Gospels. It was not in the copy used
   by Victor of Antioch. There is also negative patristic evidence against
   it, particularly strong in the case of Cyril of Jerusalem, Tertullian,
   and Cyprian, who had special occasion to quote it (see Westcott and
   Hort, II., Append., pp. 30-38). Jerome's statement, however, is
   weakened by the fact that he seems to depend upon Eusebius, and that he
   himself translated the passage in his Vulgate.

   3. It is 'wanting in the important MS. k representing the African text
   of the Old Latin version, which has a different conclusion (like that
   in L), also in some of the best MSS. of the Armenian version, while in
   others it follows the usual subscription. It is also wanting in an
   unpublished Arabic version (made from the Greek) in the Vatican
   Library, which is likewise noteworthy for reading hosin 1 Tim. 3:16.

   4. The way in which the section begins, and in which it refers to Mary
   Magdalene, give it the air of a conclusion derived from some extraneous
   source. It does not record the fulfilment of the promise in Mark 16:7.
   It uses (16:9) prote sabbatoufor the Hebraistic te mia-i-i ton
   sabbatonof 16:2. It has many words or phrases (e.g., poreuomaiused
   three times) not elsewhere found in Mark, which strengthen the
   impression that we are dealing with a different writer, and it lacks
   Mark's usual graphic detail. But the argument from difference of style
   and vocabulary has been overstrained, and can not be regarded as in
   itself decisive.

   II. Arguments in favor of the genuineness:

   1. The section is found in most of the uncial MSS., A C D Ch G D S, in
   all the late uncials (in L as a secondary reading), and in all the
   cursive MSS., including 1, 33, 69, etc.; though a number of the
   cursives either mark it with an asterisk or note its omission in older
   copies. Hence the statements of Eusebius and Jerome seem to need some
   qualification. In MSS 22 (as Dr. Burgon has first pointed out) the
   liturgical word telosdenoting the end of a reading lesson, is inserted
   after both Mark 16:8 and 16:20, while no such word is placed at the end
   of the other Gospels. This shows that there were two endings of Mark in
   different copies.

   2. Also in most of the ancient versions, the Itala (with the exception
   of "k," or the codex Bobbiensis, used by Columban), the Vulgate, the
   Curetonian Syriac (last part), the Peshito, the Philoxenian, the
   Coptic, the Gothic (first part), and the Aethiopic, but in several MSS.
   only after the spurious shorter conclusion. Of these versions the
   Itala, the Curetonian and Peshito Syriac, and the Coptic, are older
   than any of our Greek codices, but the MSS. of the Coptic are not older
   than the twelfth or tenth century, and may have undergone changes as
   well as the Greek MSS.; and the MSS. of the Ethiopic are all modern.
   The best MSS. of the old Latin are mutilated here. The only extant
   fragment of Mark in the Curetonian Syriac is 16:17-20, so that we
   cannot tell whether Mark 16:9-20 immediately followed 16:8, or appeared
   as they do in cod. L. But Aphraates quotes it.

   3. In all the existing Greek and Syriac lectionaries or evangeliaries
   and synaxaries, as far as examined, which contain the Scripture reading
   lessons for the churches. Dr. Burgon lays great stress on their
   testimony (ch. X.), but he overrates their antiquity. The
   lection-systems cannot be traced beyond the middle of the fourth
   century when great liturgical changes took place. At that time the
   disputed verses were widely circulated and eagerly seized as a suitable
   resurrection and ascension lesson.

   4. Irenaeus of Lyons, in the second half of the second century, long
   before Eusebius, expressly quotes Mark 16:19 as a part of the Gospel of
   Mark (Adv. Haer., III. 10, 6). The still earlier testimony of Justin
   Martyr (Apol., I. 45) is doubtful (The quotation of Mark 16:17 and 18
   in lib. viii., c. 1 of the Apostolic Constitutions is wrongly ascribed
   to Hippolytus.) Marinus, Macarius Magnes (or at least the heathen
   writer whom he cites), Didymus, Chrysostom (??), Epiphanius, Nestorius,
   the apocryphal Gesta Pilati, Ambrose, Augustin, and other later fathers
   quote from the section.

   5. A strong intrinsic argument is derived from the fact that Mark
   cannot intentionally have concluded his Gospel with the words
   ephobounto gar(Mark 16:8). He must either have himself written the last
   verses or some other conclusion, which was accidently lost before the
   book was multiplied by transcription; or he was unexpectedly prevented
   from finishing his book, and the conclusion was supplied by a friendly
   hand from oral tradition or some written source.

   In view of these facts the critics and exegetes are very much divided.
   The passage is defended as genuine by Simon, Mill, Bengel, Storr,
   Matthaei, Hug, Schleiermacher, De Wette, Bleek, Olshausen, Lange,
   Ebrard, Hilgenfeld, Broadus ("Bapt. Quarterly," Philad., 1869), Burgon
   (1871), Scrivener, Wordsworth, McClellan, Cook, Morison (1882). It is
   rejected or questioned by the critical editors, Griesbach, Lachmann,
   Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort (though retained by
   all in the text with or without brackets), and by such critics and
   Commentators as Fritzsche, Credner, Reuss, Wieseler, Holtzmann, Keim,
   Scholten, Klostermann, Ewald, Meyer, Weiss, Norton, Davidson. Some of
   these opponents, however, while denying the composition of the section
   by Mark, regard the contents as a part of the apostolic tradition.
   Michelsen surrenders only 16:9-14, and saves 16:15-20. Ewald and
   Holtzmann conjecture the original conclusion from 16:9, 10 and 16-20;
   Volkmar invents one from elements of all the Synoptists.

   III. Solutions of the problem. All mere conjectures; certainty is
   impossible in this case.

   1. Mark himself added the section in a later edition, issued perhaps in
   Alexandria, having been interrupted in Rome just as he came to 16:8,
   either by Peter's imprisonment and martyrdom, or by sickness, or some
   accident. Incomplete copies got into circulation before he was able to
   finish the book. So Michaelis, Hug, and others.

   2. The original conclusion of Mark was lost by some accident, most
   probably from the original autograph (where it may have occupied a
   separate leaf), and the present paragraph was substituted by an
   anonymous editor or collector in the second century. So Griesbach,
   Schulthess, David Schulz.

   3. Luke wrote the section. So Hitzig (Johannes Marcus, p. 187).

   4. Godet (in his Com. on Luke, p. 8 and p. 513, Engl. transl.) modifies
   this hypothesis by assuming that a third hand supplied the close,
   partly from Luke's Gospel, which had appeared in the mean time, and
   partly (Mark 16:17, 18) from another source. He supposes that Mark was
   interrupted by the unexpected outbreak of the Neronian persecution in
   64 and precipitously fled from the capital, leaving his unfinished
   Gospel behind, which was afterward completed when Luke's Gospel
   appeared. In this way Godet accounts for the fact that up to Mark 16:8
   Luke had no influence on Mark, while such influence is apparent in the
   concluding section.

   5. It was the end of one of the lost Gospel fragments used by Luke 1:1,
   and appended to Mark's by the last redactor. Ewald.

   6. The section is from the pen of Mark, but was purposely omitted by
   some scribe in the third century from hierarchical prejudice, because
   it represents the apostles in an unfavorable light after the
   resurrection, so that the Lord "upbraided them with their unbelief and
   hardness of heart" (Mark 16:14). Lange (Leben Jesu, I. 166). Unlikely.

   7. The passage is genuine, but was omitted in some valuable copy by a
   misunderstanding of the word teloswhich often is found after Mark 16:8
   in cursives. So Burgon. "According to the Western order," he says (in
   the "Quarterly Review" for Oct., 1881), "S. Mark occupies the last
   place. From the earliest period it had been customary to write
   telos(The End) after 16:8, in token that there a famous ecclesiastical
   lection comes to a close. Let the last leaf of one very ancient
   archetypal copy have begun at 16:9, and let that last leaf have
   perished;--and all is plain. A faithful copyist will have ended the
   Gospel perforce--as B and ' have done--at S. Mark 16:8." But this
   liturgical mark is not old enough to explain the omission in ', B, and
   the MSS. of Eusebius and Jerome; and a reading lesson would close as
   abruptly with garas the Gospel itself.

   8. The passage cannot claim any apostolic authority; but it is
   doubtless founded on some tradition of the apostolic age. Its
   authorship and precise date must remain unknown, but it is apparently
   older than the time when the canonical Gospels were generally received;
   for although it has points of contact with them all, it contains no
   attempt to harmonize their various representations of the course of
   events. So Dr. Hort (II., Appendix, 51). A similar view was held by
   Dean Alford.

   For full information we refer to the critical apparatus of Tischendorf
   and Tregelles, to the monograph of Weiss on Mark (Das Marcusevang., pp.
   512-515), and especially to the exhaustive discussion of Westcott and
   Hort in the second volume (Append., pp. 29-51). The most elaborate
   vindication of the genuineness is by Dean Burgon: The Last Twelve
   Verses o f the Gospel according to S. Mark Vindicated against Recent
   Critical Objections and Established (Oxford and Lond., 1871, 334
   pages), a very learned book, but marred by its over-confident tone and
   unreasonable hostility to the oldest uncial MSS. (' and B) and the most
   meritorious textual critics (Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles). For
   other able defences see Dr. Scrivener (Introd. to the Criticism of the
   New Test., 3d ed., 1883, pp. 583-590), Dr. Morison (Com. on Mark, pp.
   446 and 463 sqq.), and Canon Cook (in Speaker's Com. on Mark, pp.
   301-308).

   Lachmann gives the disputed section, according to his principle to
   furnish the text as found in the fourth century, but did not consider
   it genuine (see his article in "Studien und Kritiken" for 1830, p.
   843). Tischendorf and Tregelles set the twelve verses apart. Alford
   incloses them in single brackets, Westcott and Hort in double brackets,
   as an early interpolation; the Revised Version of 1881 retains them
   with a marginal note, and with a space between Mark 16:8 and 9. Dean
   Burgon ("Quarterly Rev." for Oct., 1881) holds this note of the
   Revision (which simply states an acknowledged fact) to be "the gravest
   blot of all," and triumphantly refers the critical editors and
   Revisionists to his "separate treatise extending over 300 pages, which
   for the best of reasons has never yet been answered," and in which he
   has "demonstrated," as he assures us, that the last twelve verses in
   Mark are "as trustworthy as any other verses which can be named." The
   infallible organ in the Vatican seems to have a formidable rival in
   Chichester, but they are in irreconcilable conflict on the true reading
   of the angelic anthem (Luke 2:14): the Pope chanting with the Vulgate
   the genitive (eudokias,bonae voluntatis), the Dean, in the same
   article, denouncing this as a "grievous perversion of the truth of
   Scripture," and holding the evidence for the nominative (eudokia) to be
   "absolutely decisive," as if the combined testimony of '* A B D,
   Irenaeus, Origen (lat.), Jerome, all the Latin MSS., and the Latin
   Gloria in Excelsis were of no account, as compared with his judgment or
   preference.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [942] Marcus, and the diminutive Marcellus (Little Mallet), are well
   known Roman names. Marcus Tullius Cicero wrote an oration pro Marco
   Marcello.

   [944] There is no good reason for taking "son" here literally (with
   Credner), when the figurative meaning so fully harmonizes with
   Scripture usage and with what we otherwise certainly know of Mark's
   intimate relations to Peter both from the Acts and from tradition. A
   daughter of Peter (Petronilla) is mentioned by tradition, but not a
   son. Clement of Alexandria says that Peter and Philip begat children."

   [946] emnemoneuse. It is so translated by Valois, Lardner, Meyer,
   Weiss, Lightfoot. The rendering "recorded," which is preferred by Crusé
   and Morison, makes it tautological with the preceding egrapsen. The
   "he" may be referred to Mark or to Peter, probably to the former.

   [947] all ouch hosper suntaxin ton kuriakon logon(orlogion, oracles).

   [948] Euseb., Hist, Eccl., III. 39. For a critical discussion of this
   important testimony see Weiss and Morison, also Lightfoot in the
   "Contemp. Rev.," vol. XXVI. (1875), pp. 393 sqq. There is not the
   slightest evidence for referring this description to a fictitious
   pre-canonical Mark, as is still done by Davidson (new ed., I. 539).

   [949] The Latin was provincial, the Greek universal in the Roman
   empire. Cicero (Pro Arch., 10): "Graeca leguntur in omnibus fere
   gentibus; Latina suis finibus, exiguis sane, continentur." The
   tradition that Mark wrote his Gospel first in Latin is too late to
   deserve any credit. Baronius defends it in the interest of the Vulgate,
   and puts the composition back to the year 45. The supposed Latin
   autograph of Mark's Gospel at Venice is a fragment of the Vulgate.

   [950] Justin Martyr (Dial.c. Tryph., c. 106) actually quotes from the
   "Memoirs (apomnemoneumata) of Peter" the designation of the sons of
   Zebedee, "Boanerges" or "Sons of Thunder;" but he evidently refers to
   the written Gospel of Mark, who alone mentions this fact, Mark 3:17.

   [951] See the testimonies of Jerome, Eusebius, Origen, Tertullian,
   Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, and Papias, well
   presented in Kirchhofer (ed. Charteris) on Canonicity, pp. 141-150, and
   in Morison's Com., pp. xx-xxxiv

   [952] Mark 16:19: "The Lord Jesus ... was received up into heaven, and
   sat down at the right hand of God;" comp. 1 Pet, 3:22: "who is on the
   right hand of God, having gone into heaven."

   [953] Mark 8:27-33; compared with Matt. 16:13-33.

   [954] Dem. Evang., III. 5, quoted by Morison, p. xxxv. In view of the
   facts quoted above the reader may judge of Dr. Davidson's assertion
   (Introd. 1882 vol. I., 541): "That Mark was not the writer of the
   canonnical Gospel may be inferred from the fact that it is not
   specially remarkable in particulars relative to Peter."

   [955] Irenaeus (Adv. Haer., III. 1) says "after the departure" of Peter
   and Paul, "post horum excessum," or in the original Greek preserved by
   Eusebius (H. E., V. 8. ed. Heinichen, 1. 224), meta ten touton exodon.
   This must mean "after their decease," not "after their departure from
   Rome" (Grabe). But Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Epiphanius, Eusebius,
   Jerome, and other fathers assign the composition to a time before the
   martyrdom of Peter. Christophorson (in his Latin Version of the Church
   History of Eusebius, publ. 1570, as quoted by Stieren in Iren. Op., I.
   423, note 4) suggested a different reading, meta ten ekdosin, i.e.,
   after the publication of Matthew's Hebrew Gospel, as spoken of in the
   preceding sentence, and Morison (p. xxv) seems inclined to accept this
   conjecture. Very unlikely; all the MSS., Rufinus and the Latin
   translator of Irenaeus read exodon. See Stieren, in loc. The
   conflicting statements can be easily harmonized by a distinction
   between the composition before, and the publication after, the death of
   Peter. By publication in those days was meant the copying and
   distribution of a book.

   [956] Acts 10:38. The sermon of Peter to Cornelius is the Gospel of
   Mark in a nutshell.

   [957] Lange (Com., p. 2): "Mark delineates Christ as, from first to
   last, preeminently the victorious conqueror of all Satanic powers. He
   has left us a record of the manifestation of Christ's power when that
   great Lion seized upon the ancient world, and of his brief but decisive
   victory, after which only the ruins of the ancient world are left,
   which in turn furnish the materials for the new one." Thomson
   (Speaker's Com., Introd. to Gospels, p. xxxv): "The wonder-working son
   of God sweeps over his kingdom, swiftly and meteor-like: and men are to
   wonder and adore. His course is sometimes represented as abrupt,
   mysterious, awful to the disciples: He leaves them at night; conceals
   himself from them on a journey. The disciples are amazed and afraid
   (Mark 10:24, 32). And the Evangelist means the same impression of awe
   to be imparted to the reader."

   [958] The reading of the textus rec. huiou (tou) theou in Mark 1:1 is
   sustained by 'ABDL, nearly all the cursives, and retained by Lachmann
   and Tregelles in the text, by Westcott and Hort in the margin.
   Tischendorf omitted it in his 8th ed. on the strength of his favorite
   '*(in its original form), and Origen. Irenaeus has both readings. The
   term occurs seven times in Mark, and is especially appropriate at the
   beginning of his Gospel and a part of its very title.

   [959] Mark 3:17; 5:41; 7:1-4; 12:18; 15:6, 35.

   [960] See Lange's Analysis of Mark, Com., pp. 12-14; also his
   Bibelkunde, pp. 185-187. Lange discovered many characteristic features
   of the Gospels, which have passed without acknowledgment into many
   other books.

   [961] As asserted by Baur, Schwegler, Köstlin, and quite recently again
   by Dr. Davidson, who says (I. 505): "The colorless neutrality of the
   Gospel was an important factor in conciliating antagonistic parties."
   Dr. Morison (p. xlvi) well remarks against this Tübingen tendency
   criticism: "There is not so much as a straw of evidence that the Gospel
   of Mark occupied a position of mediation, or irenic neutrality, in
   relation to the other two Synoptic Gospels. It is in the mere
   wantonness of a creative imagination that its penman is depicted as
   warily steering his critical bark between some Scylla in St. Matthew's
   representations and some Charybdis in St. Luke's. There is no Scylla in
   the representations of St. Matthew. It must be invented if suspected.
   There is no Charybdis in the representations of St. Luke. Neither is
   there any indication in St. Mark of wary steering, or of some latent
   aim of destination kept, like sealed orders, under lock and key. There
   is, in all the Gospels, perfect transparency and simplicity, 'the
   simplicity that is in Christ.'"

   [962] Ewald characterizes Mark's style as the Schmelz der frischen
   Blume, as the volle, reine Leben der Stoffe, Kahnis as drastisch and
   frappant, Meyer as malerisch anschaulich. Lange speaks of the
   "enthusiasm and vividness of realization which accounts for the
   brevity, rapidity, and somewhat dramatic tone of the narrative, and the
   introduction of details which give life to the scene."

   [963] kensos (census),
   kenturion(centurio),xestes(sextarius),spekoulatop(speculator), and the
   Latinizing phrases to hikanon poiein(satisfacere, Mark 15:15), eschatos
   echei, (in extremis esse), sumboulion didonai (consilium dare). Mark
   even uses the Roman names of coins instead of the Greek,
   kodrantes(quadrans, 12:42).

   [964] eutheos or euthus occurs (according to Bruder's Concord.)
   forty-one times in the Gospel of Mark, nearly as often as in all other
   New Test. writings combined. But there are some variations in reading.
   Codex D omits it in several passages. The English Version, by its
   inexcusable love of variations, obliterates many characteristic
   features of the sacred writers. This very particle is translated in no
   less than seven different ways: straightway, immediately, forthwith, as
   soon as, by and by, shortly, and anon.

   l., " would discern in the young man not a little that was really
   amiable, the result of the partial reception and reflection of gracious
   Divine influences. There was ingenuousness, for instance, and moral
   earnestness. There was restraint of the animal passions, and an

   [982] Jerome wrote to Hedibia, a pious lady in Gaul (Ep. CXX c. 10, in
   Opera, ed. Migne, I. 1002): "Habebat ergo [Paulus] Titum interpretem;
   sicut et beatus Petrus Marcum, cuius evangelium Petro narrante (not
   dictante), et illo [Marco]scribente, compositum est." This letter was
   written in 406 or 407, from Bethlehem. Morison (p. xxxvii): "If we
   assume the Patristic tradition regarding St. Peter's relation to St.
   Mark, we find the contents and texture of the Gospel to be without a
   jar at any point, in perfect accord with the idea."

   [983] So James Smith in his Dissertation on the Origin and Connection
   of the Gospels, and again in the Dissertation on the Life and Writings
   of St. Luke, prefixed to the fourth ed. of his Voyage and Shipwreck of
   St. Paul (1880), pp. 29 sqq.

   [984] "In substance and style and treatment, the Gospel of St, Mark is
   essentially a transcript from life. The course and the issue of facts
   are imaged in it with the clearest outline. If all other arguments
   against the mythic origin of the Evangelic narratives were wanting,
   this vivid and simple record, stamped with the most distinct impress of
   independence and originality,--totally unconnected with the symbolism
   of the Old Dispensation, totally independent of the deeper reasonings
   of the New,--would be sufficient to refute a theory subversive of all
   faith in history. The details which were originally addressed to the
   vigorous intelligence of Roman bearers are still pregnant with
   instruction for us. The teaching which 'met their wants' in the first
   age, finds a corresponding field for its action now." Westcott, l.c.,
   369 (Am. ed.).

   [985] Mark 16:16 ho pisteusas kai baptistheis sothesetai, ho de
   apistesas katakrithesetai. This declaration takes the place of the
   command to baptize, Matt. 28:19. It applies only to converted believers
   (ho pisteusas), not to children who are incapable of an act of faith or
   unbelief, and yet are included in the covenant blessing of Christian
   parents (comp. 1 Cor. 7:14). Hence it is only positive unbelief which
   condemns, whether with or without baptism; while faith saves with
   baptism, ordinarily, but exceptionally also without baptism. Else we
   should have to condemn the penitent thief, the Quakers, and all
   unbaptized infants. St. Augustin derived from this passage and from
   John 3:5 (ex hudatos) the doctrine of the absolute and universal
   necessity of water-baptism for salvation; and hence the further
   (logical, but not theological inference drawn by the great and good
   bishop of Hippo, with reluctant heart, that all unbaptized infants
   dying in infancy are forever damned (or, at least, excluded from
   heaven), simply on account of Adam's sin, before they were capable of
   committing an actual transgression. This is the doctrine of the Roman
   Church to this day. Some Calvinistic divines in the seventeenth century
   held the same view with regard to reprobate infants (if there be such),
   but allowed an indefinite extension of the number of elect infants
   beyond the confines of Christendom. Zwingli held that all infants dying
   in infancy are saved. Fortunately the Saviour of mankind has condemned
   the dogma horribile of infant damnation by his own conduct toward
   (unbaptized) children, and his express declaration that to them belongs
   the kingdom of heaven, and that our heavenly Father does not wish any
   of them to perish. Matt. 18:2-6; 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke
   18:15-17. In the light of these passages we must explain John 3:5 and
   Mark 16:16, which have been so grossly misunderstood.

   Life of Luke.

   As Mark is inseparably associated with Peter, so is Luke with Paul.
   There was, in both cases, a foreordained correspondence and
   congeniality between the apostle and the historian or co-laborer. We
   find such holy and useful friendships in the great formative epochs of
   the church, notably so in the time of the Reformation, between Luther
   and Melanchthon, Zwingli and Oecolampadius, Calvin and Beza, Cranmer,
   Latimer and Ridley; and at a later period between the two Wesleys and
   Whitefield. Mark, the Hebrew Roman "interpreter" of the Galilaean
   fisherman, gave us the shortest, freshest, but least elegant and
   literary of the Gospels; Luke, the educated Greek, "the beloved
   physician," and faithful companion of Saul of Tarsus, composed the
   longest and most literary Gospel, and connected it with the great
   events in secular history under the reigns of Augustus and his
   successors. If the former was called the Gospel of Peter by the
   ancients, the latter, in a less direct sense, may be called the Gospel
   of Paul, for its agreement in spirit with the teaching of the Apostle
   of the Gentiles. In their accounts of the institution of the Lord's
   Supper there is even a verbal agreement which points to the same source
   of information. No doubt there was frequent conference between the two,
   but no allusion is made to each other's writings, which tends to prove
   that they were composed independently during the same period, or not
   far apart. [987]

   Luke nowhere mentions his name in the two books which are by the
   unanimous consent of antiquity ascribed to him, and bear all the marks
   of the same authorship; but he is modestly concealed under the "we" of
   a great portion of the Acts, which is but a continuation of the third
   Gospel. [988] He is honorably and affectionately mentioned three times
   by Paul during his imprisonment, as "the beloved physician" (Col.
   4:14), as one of his "fellow-laborers" (Philem. 24), and as the most
   faithful friend who remained with him when friend after friend had
   deserted him (2 Tim. 4:11). His medical profession, although carried on
   frequently by superior slaves, implies some degree of education and
   accounts for the accuracy of his medical terms and description of
   diseases. [989] It gave him access to many families of social position,
   especially in the East, where physicians are rare. It made him all the
   more useful to Paul in the infirmities of his flesh and his exhausting
   labors. [990]

   He was a Gentile by birth, [991] though he may have become a proselyte
   of the gate. His nationality and antecedents are unknown. He was
   probably a Syrian of Antioch, and one of the earliest converts in that
   mother church of Gentile Christianity. [992] This conjecture is
   confirmed by the fact that he gives us much information about the
   church in Antioch (Acts 11:19-30; 13:1-3; 15:1-3, 22-35), that he
   traces the origin of the name "Christians" to that city (11:19), and
   that in enumerating the seven deacons of Jerusalem he informs us of the
   Antiochian origin of Nicolas (Acts 6:5), without mentioning the
   nationality of any of the others. [993]

   We meet Luke first as a companion of Paul at Troas, when, after the
   Macedonian call, "Come over and help us," he was about to carry the
   gospel to Greece on his second great missionary tour. For from that
   important epoch Luke uses the first personal pronoun in the plural:
   "When he [Paul] had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth
   into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel
   unto them" (Acts 16:10). He accompanied him to Philippi and seems to
   have remained there after the departure of Paul and Silas for Corinth
   (a.d. 51), in charge of the infant church; for the "we" is suddenly
   replaced by "they" (17:1). Seven years later (a.d. 58) he joined the
   apostle again, when he passed through Philippi on his last journey to
   Jerusalem, stopping a week at Troas (Acts 20:5, 6); for from that
   moment Luke resumes the "we" of the narrative. He was with Paul or near
   him at Jerusalem and two years at Caesarea, accompanied him on his
   perilous voyage to Rome, of which he gives a most accurate account, and
   remained with him to the end of his first Roman captivity, with which
   he closes his record (a.d. 63). He may however, have been temporarily
   absent on mission work during the four years of Paul's imprisonment.
   Whether he accompanied him on his intended visit to Spain and to the
   East, after the year 63, we do not know. The last allusion to him is
   the word of Paul when on the point of martyrdom: "Only Luke is with me"
   (2 Tim. 4:11).

   The Bible leaves Luke at the height of his usefulness in the best
   company, with Paul preaching the gospel in the metropolis of the world.

   Post-apostolic tradition, always far below the healthy and certain tone
   of the New Testament, mostly vague and often contradictory, never
   reliable, adds that he lived to the age of eighty-four, labored in
   several countries, was a painter of portraits of Jesus, of the Virgin,
   and the apostles, and that he was crucified on an olive-tree at Elaea
   in Greece. His real or supposed remains, together with those of Andrew
   the apostle, were transferred from Patrae in Achaia to the Church of
   the Apostles in Constantinople. [994]

   The symbolic poetry of the Church assigns to him the sacrificial ox;
   but the symbol of man is more appropriate; for his Gospel is par
   excellence the Gospel of the Son of Man.

   Sources of Information.

   According to his own confession in the preface, Luke was no eye-witness
   of the gospel history, [995] but derived his information from oral
   reports of primitive disciples, and from numerous fragmentary documents
   then already in circulation. He wrote the Gospel from what he had heard
   and read, the Acts from, what he had seen and heard. He traced the
   origin of Christianity "accurately from the beginning."

   His opportunities were the very best. He visited the principal
   apostolic churches between Jerusalem and Rome, and came in personal
   contact with the founders and leaders. He met Peter, Mark, and Barnabas
   at Antioch, James and his elders at Jerusalem (on Paul's last visit)
   Philip and his daughters at Caesarea, the early converts in Greece and
   Rome; and he enjoyed, besides, the benefit of all the information which
   Paul himself had received by revelation or collected from personal
   intercourse with his fellow-apostles and other primitive disciples. The
   sources for the history of the infancy were Jewish-Christian and
   Aramaean (hence the strongly Hebraizing coloring of Luke 1-2); his
   information of the activity of Christ in Samaria was probably derived
   from Philip, who labored there as an evangelist and afterwards in
   Caesarea. But a man of Luke's historic instinct and conscientiousness
   would be led to visit also in person the localities in Galilee which
   are immortalized by the ministry of Christ. From Jerusalem or Caesarea
   he could reach them all in three or four days.

   The question whether Luke also used one or both of the other Synoptic
   Gospels has already been discussed in a previous section. It is
   improbable that he included them among his evidently fragmentary
   sources alluded to in the preface. It is certain that he had no
   knowledge of our Greek Matthew; on the use of a lost Hebrew Matthew and
   of Mark the opinion of good scholars is divided, but the resemblance
   with Mark, though very striking in some sections, [996] is not of such
   a character that it cannot as well, and even better, be explained from
   prior oral tradition or autoptical memoirs, especially if we consider
   that the resemblances are neutralized by unaccountable differences and
   omissions. The matter is not helped by a reference to a proto-Mark,
   either Hebrew or Greek, of which we know nothing.

   Luke has a great deal of original and most valuable matter, which
   proves his independence and the variety of his sources. He adds much to
   our knowledge of the Saviour, and surpasses Matthew and Mark in
   fulness, accuracy, and chronological order--three points which, with
   all modesty, he claims to have aimed at in his preface. [997] Sometimes
   he gives special fitness and beauty to a word of Christ by inserting it
   in its proper place in the narrative, and connecting it with a
   particular occasion. But there are some exceptions, where Matthew is
   fuller, and where Mark is more chronological. Considering the fact that
   about thirty years had elapsed since the occurrence of the events, we
   need not wonder that some facts and words were dislocated, and that
   Luke, with all his honest zeal, did not always succeed in giving the
   original order.

   The peculiar sections of Luke are in keeping with the rest. They have
   not the most remote affinity with apocryphal marvels and fables, nor
   even with the orthodox traditions and legends of the post-apostolic
   age, but are in full harmony with the picture of Christ as it shines
   from the other Gospels and from the Epistles. His accuracy has been put
   to the severest test, especially in the Acts, where he frequently
   alludes to secular rulers and events; but while a few chronological
   difficulties, as that of the census of Quirinius, are not yet
   satisfactorily removed, he has upon the whole, even in minute
   particulars, been proven to be a faithful, reliable, and well informed
   historian.

   He is the proper father of Christian church history, and a model well
   worthy of imitation for his study of the sources, his conscientious
   accuracy, his modesty and his lofty aim to instruct and confirm in the
   truth.

   Dedication and Object.

   The third Gospel, as well as the Acts of the Apostles, is dedicated to
   a certain Theophilus (i.e., Friend of God), a man of social
   distinction, perhaps in the service of the government, as appears from
   his title "honorable" or "most noble." [998] He was either a convert or
   at least a catechumen in preparation for church membership, and willing
   to become sponsor and patron of these books. The custom of dedicating
   books to princes and rich friends of literature was formerly very
   frequent, and has not died out yet. As to his race and residence we can
   only conjecture that Theophilus was a Greek of Antioch, where Luke,
   himself probably an Antiochean, may have previously known him either as
   his freedman or physician. The pseudo-Clementine Recognitions mention a
   certain nobleman of that name at Antioch who was converted by Peter and
   changed his palace into a church and residence of the apostle. [999]

   The object of Luke was to confirm Theophilus and through him all his
   readers in the faith in which he had already been orally instructed,
   and to lead him to the conviction of the irrefragable certainty of the
   facts on which Christianity rests. [1000]

   Luke wrote for Gentile Christians, especially Greeks, as Matthew wrote
   for Jews, Mark for Romans, John for advanced believers without
   distinction of nationality. He briefly explains for Gentile readers the
   position of Palestinian towns, as Nazareth, Capernaum, Arimathaea, and
   the distance of Mount Olivet and Emmaus from Jerusalem. [1001] He does
   not, like Matthew, look back to the past and point out the fulfilment
   of ancient prophecy with a view to prove that Jesus of Nazareth is the
   promised Messiah, but takes a universal view of Christ as the Saviour
   of all men and fulfiller of the aspirations of every human heart. He
   brings him in contact with the events of secular history in the vast
   empire of Augustus, and with the whole human race by tracing his
   ancestry back to Adam.

   These features would suit Gentile readers generally, Romans as well as
   Greeks. But the long residence of Luke in Greece, and the ancient
   tradition that he labored and died there, give strength to the view
   that he had before his mind chiefly readers of that country. According
   to Jerome the Gospel was written (completed) in Achaia and Boeotia. The
   whole book is undoubtedly admirably suited to Greek taste. It at once
   captivates the refined Hellenic ear by a historic prologue of classic
   construction, resembling the prologues of Herodotus and Thucydides. It
   is not without interest to compare them.

   Luke begins: "Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a
   narrative concerning those matters which have been fufilled among us,
   even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
   eyewitnesses and ministers of the word: it seemed good to me also,
   having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to
   write unto thee in order, most noble Theophilus; that thou mightest
   know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed."

   Herodotus: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus,
   which he publishes, in order to preserve from oblivion the remembrance
   of former deeds of men, and to secure a just tribute of glory to the
   great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the barbarians; and
   withal to put on record what were their grounds of feud."

   Thucydides: "Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war in
   which the Peloponnesians and the Athenians fought against one another.
   He began to write when they first took up arms, believing that it would
   be great and memorable above any previous war. For he argued that both
   States were then at the full height of their military power, and he saw
   the rest of the Hellenes either siding or intending to side with one or
   other of them. No movement ever stirred Hellas more deeply than this;
   it was shared by many of the barbarians, and might be said even to
   affect the world at large." (Jowett's translation.)

   These prefaces excel alike in brevity, taste, and tact, but with this
   characteristic difference: the Evangelist modestly withholds his name
   and writes in the pure interest of truth a record of the gospel of
   peace for the spiritual welfare of all men; while the great pagan
   historians are inspired by love of glory, and aim to immortalize the
   destructive wars and feuds of Greeks and barbarians.

   Contents of the Gospel of Luke.

   After a historiographic preface, Luke gives us: first a history of the
   birth and infancy of John the Baptist and Jesus, from Hebrew sources,
   with an incident from the boyhood of the Saviour (Luke 1 and 2). Then
   he unfolds the history of the public ministry in chronological order
   from the baptism in the Jordan to the resurrection and ascension. We
   need only point out those facts and discourses which are not found in
   the other Gospels and which complete the Synoptic history at the
   beginning, middle, and end of the life of our Lord. [1002]

   Luke supplies the following sections:

   I. In the history of the Infancy of John and Christ:

   The appearance of the angel of the Lord to Zacharias in the temple
   announcing the birth of John, Luke 1:5-25.

   The annunciation of the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary, 1:26-38.

   The visit of the Virgin Mary to Elizabeth; the salutation of Elizabeth,
   1:39-45.

   The Magnificat of the Virgin Mary, 1:46-56.

   The birth of John the Baptist, 1:57-66.

   The Benedictus of Zacharias, 1:67-80.

   The visit of Jesus in his twelfth year to the passover in Jerusalem,
   and his conversation with the Jewish doctors in the Temple, 2:41-52.

   To this must be added the genealogy of Christ from Abraham up to Adam;
   while Matthew begins, in the inverse order, with Abraham, and presents
   in the parallel section several differences which show their mutual
   independence, Luke 3:23-38; comp. Matt. 1:1-17.

   II. In the Public Life of our Lord a whole group of important events,
   discourses, and incidents which occurred at different periods, but
   mostly on a circuitous journey from Capernaum to Jerusalem through
   Samaria and Peraea (9:51-18:14). This section includes--

   1. The following miracles and incidents:

   The miraculous draught of fishes, 5:4-11.

   The raising of the widow's son at Nain, 7:11-18.

   7:36-50.

   The support of Christ by devout women who are named, 8:2, 3.

   The rebuke of the Sons of Thunder in a Samaritan village, 9:51-56.

   The Mission and Instruction of the Seventy, 10:1-6.

   Entertainment at the house of Martha and Mary; the one thing needful,

   The two Debtors, 7:41-43.

   The good Samaritan, 10:25-37.

   The importunate Friend, 11:5-8.

   The rich Fool, 12:16-21.

   The barren Fig-tree, 13:6-9.

   Dives and Lazarus, 16:19-31.

   The importunate Widow, and the unjust Judge, 18:1-8.

   The Pharisee and the Publican 18:10-14.

   Mark, 16:12, 13.

   The account of the ascension, Luke 24:50-53; comp. Mark 16:19, 20; and
   Acts 1:3-12.

   Characteristic Features of Luke.

   The third Gospel is the Gospel of free salvation to all men. [1003]
   This corresponds to the two cardinal points in the doctrinal system of
   Paul: gratuitousness and universalness of salvation.

   1. It is eminently the Gospel of free salvation by grace through faith.
   Its motto is: Christ came to save sinners. "Saviour" and "salvation"
   are the most prominent ideas [1004] Mary, anticipating the birth of her
   Son, rejoices in God her "Saviour" (Luke 1:47); and an angel announces
   to the shepherds of Bethlehem "good tidings of great joy which shall be
   to all the people "(2:10), namely, the birth of Jesus as the "Saviour"
   of men (not only as the Christ of the Jews). He is throughout
   represented as the merciful friend of sinners, as the healer of the
   sick, as the comforter of the broken-hearted, as the shepherd of the
   lost sheep. The parables peculiar to Luke--of the prodigal son, of the
   lost piece of money, of the publican in the temple, of the good
   Samaritan--exhibit this great truth which Paul so fully sets forth in
   his Epistles. The parable of the Pharisee and the publican plucks up
   self-righteousness by the root, and is the foundation of the doctrine
   of justification by faith. The paralytic and the woman that was a
   sinner received pardon by faith alone. Luke alone relates the prayer of
   Christ on the cross for his murderers, and the promise of paradise to
   the penitent robber, and he ends with a picture of the ascending
   Saviour lifting up his hands and blessing his disciples.

   The other Evangelists do not neglect this aspect of Christ; nothing can
   be more sweet and comforting than his invitation to sinners in Matthew
   11, or his farewell to the disciples in John; but Luke dwells on it
   with peculiar delight. He is the painter of Christus Salvator and
   Christus Consolator.

   2. It is the Gospel of universal salvation. It is emphatically the
   Gospel for the Gentiles. Hence the genealogy of Christ is traced back
   not only to Abraham (as in Matthew), but to Adam, the son of God and
   the father of all men (Luke 3:38). Christ is the second Adam from
   heaven, the representative Head of redeemed humanity--an idea further
   developed by Paul. The infant Saviour is greeted by Simeon as a "Light
   for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel"
   (2:32). The Baptist, in applying the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the
   voice in the wilderness (Isa. 40), adds the words (from Isa. 52:10):
   "All flesh shall see the salvation of God" (Luke 3:6). Luke alone
   records the mission of the Seventy Disciples who represent the Gentile
   nations, as the Twelve represent the twelve tribes of Israel. He alone
   mentions the mission of Elijah to the heathen widow in Sarepta, and the
   cleansing of Naaman the Syrian by Elisha (4:26, 27). He contrasts the
   gratitude of the leprous Samaritan with the ingratitude of the nine
   Jewish lepers (17:12-18). He selects discourses and parables, which
   exhibit God's mercy to Samaritans and Gentiles [1005] Yet there is no
   contradiction, for some of the strongest passages which exhibit
   Christ's mercy to the Gentiles and humble the Jewish pride are found in
   Matthew, the Jewish Evangelist. [1006] The assertion that the third
   Gospel is a glorification of the Gentile (Pauline) apostolate, and a
   covert attack on the Twelve, especially Peter, is a pure fiction of
   modern hypercriticism.

   3. It is the Gospel of the genuine and full humanity of Christ. [1007]
   It gives us the key-note for the construction of a real history of
   Jesus from infancy to boyhood and manhood. Luke represents him as the
   purest and fairest among the children of men, who became like unto us
   in all things except sin and error. He follows him through the stages
   of his growth. He alone tells us that the child Jesus "grew and waxed
   strong," not only physically, but also in "wisdom" (Luke 2:40); he
   alone reports the remarkable scene in the temple, informing us that
   Jesus, when twelve years old, sat as a learner "in the midst of the
   doctors, both hearing them and asking questions;" and that, even after
   that time, He "advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God
   and men" (2:46, 52). All the Synoptists narrate the temptation in the
   wilderness, and Mark adds horror to the scene by the remark that Christ
   was "with the wild beasts" (Mark 1:12, meta ton therion); but Luke has
   the peculiar notice that the devil departed from Jesus only "for a
   season." He alone mentions the tears of Jesus over Jerusalem, and "the
   bloody sweat" and the strengthening angel in the agony of Gethsemane.
   As he brings out the gradual growth of Jesus, and the progress of the
   gospel from Nazareth to Capernaum, from Capernaum to Jerusalem, so
   afterwards, in the Acts, he traces the growth of the church from
   Jerusalem to Antioch, from Antioch to Ephesus and Corinth, from Greece
   to Rome. His is the Gospel of historical development. To him we are
   indebted for nearly all the hints that link the gospel facts with the
   contemporary history of the world.

   4. It is the Gospel of universal humanity. It breathes the genuine
   spirit of charity, liberty, equality, which emanate from the Saviour of
   mankind, but are so often counterfeited by his great antagonist, the
   devil. It touches the tenderest chords of human sympathy. It delights
   in recording Christ's love and compassion for the sick, the lowly, the
   despised, even the harlot and the prodigal. It mentions the beatitudes
   pronounced on the poor and the hungry, his invitation to the maimed,
   the halt, and the blind, his prayer on the cross for pardon of the
   wicked murderers, his promise to the dying robber. It rebukes the
   spirit of bigotry and intolerance of the Jews against Samaritans, in
   the parable of the good Samaritan. It reminds the Sons of Thunder when
   they were about to call fire from heaven upon a Samaritan village that
   He came not to destroy but to save. It tells us that "he who is not
   against Christ is for Christ," no matter what sectarian or unsectarian
   name he may bear.

   5. It is the Gospel for woman. It weaves the purest types of womanhood
   into the gospel story: Elizabeth, who saluted the Saviour before his
   birth; the Virgin, whom all generations call blessed; the aged
   prophetess Anna, who departed not from the temple; Martha, the busy,
   hospitable housekeeper, with her quiet, contemplative sister Mary of
   Bethany; and that noble band of female disciples who ministered of
   their substance to the temporal wants of the Son of God and his
   apostles.

   It reveals the tender compassion of Christ for all the suffering
   daughters of Eve: the widow at Nain mourning at the bier of her only
   son; for the fallen sinner who bathed his feet with her tears; for the
   poor sick woman, who had wasted all her living upon physicians, and
   whom he addressed as "Daughter;" and for the "daughters of Jerusalem"
   who followed him weeping to Calvary. If anywhere we may behold the
   divine humanity of Christ and the perfect union of purity and love,
   dignity and tender compassion, it is in the conduct of Jesus towards
   women and children. "The scribes and Pharisees gathered up their robes
   in the streets and synagogues lest they should touch a woman, and held
   it a crime to look on an unveiled woman in public; our Lord suffered a
   woman to minister to him out of whom he had cast seven devils."

   6. It is the Gospel for children, and all who are of a childlike
   spirit. It sheds a sacred halo and celestial charm over infancy, as
   perpetuating the paradise of innocence in a sinful world. It alone
   relates the birth and growth of John, the particulars of the birth of
   Christ, his circumcision and presentation in the temple, his obedience
   to parents, his growth from infancy to boyhood, from boyhood to
   manhood. Luke 1 - 2 will always be the favorite chapters for children
   and all who delight to gather around the manger of Bethlehem and to
   rejoice with shepherds on the field and angels in heaven.

   7. It is the Gospel of poetry. [1008] We mean the poetry of religion,
   the poetry of worship, the poetry of prayer and thanksgiving, a poetry
   resting not on fiction, but on facts and eternal truth. In such poetry
   there is more truth than in every-day prose. The whole book is full of
   dramatic vivacity and interest. It begins and ends with thanksgiving
   and praise. Luke 1-2 are overflowing with festive joy and gladness;
   they are a paradise of fragrant flowers, and the air is resonant with
   the sweet melodies of Hebrew psalmody and Christian hymnody. The Salute
   of Elizabeth ("Ave Maria"), the "Magnificat" of Mary, the "Benedictus"
   of Zacharias, the "Gloria in Excelsis" of the Angels, the "Nunc
   Dimittis" of Simeon, sound from generation to generation in every
   tongue, and are a perpetual inspiration for new hymns of praise to the
   glory of Christ.

   No wonder that the third Gospel has been pronounced, from a purely
   literary and humanitarian standpoint, to be the most beautiful book
   ever written. [1009]

   The Style.

   Luke is the best Greek writer among the Evangelists. [1010] His style
   shows his general culture. It is free from solecisms, rich in
   vocabulary, rhythmical in construction. But as a careful and
   conscientious historian he varies considerably with the subject and
   according to the nature of his documents.

   Matthew begins characteristically with "Book of generation" or
   "Genealogy" (biblos geneseos), which looks back to the Hebrew Sepher
   toledoth (comp. Gen. 5:1; 2:4); Mark with "Beginning of the gospel"
   (arche tou euangeliou), which introduces the reader at once to the
   scene of present action; Luke with a historiographic prologue of
   classical ring, and unsurpassed for brevity, modesty, and dignity. But
   when he enters upon the history of the infancy, which he derived no
   doubt from Aramaic traditions or documents, his language has a stronger
   Hebrew coloring than any other portion of the New Testament. The songs
   of Zacharias, Elizabeth, Mary, and Simeon, and the anthem of the
   angelic host, are the last of Hebrew psalms as well as the first of
   Christian hymns. They can be literally translated back into the Hebrew,
   without losing their beauty. [1011] The same variation in style
   characterizes the Acts; the first part is Hebrew Greek, the second
   genuine Greek.

   His vocabulary considerably exceeds that of the other Evangelists: he
   has about 180 terms which occur in his Gospel alone and nowhere else in
   the New Testament; while Matthew has only about 70, Mark 44, and John
   50 peculiar words. Luke's Gospel has 55, the Acts 135 hapax legomena,
   and among them many verbal compounds and rare technical terms.

   The medical training and practice of Luke, "the beloved physician,"
   familiarized him with medical terms, which appear quite naturally,
   without any ostentation of professional knowledge, in his descriptions
   of diseases and miracles of healing, and they agree with the vocabulary
   of ancient medical writers. Thus he speaks of the "great fever" of
   Peter's mother-in-law, with reference to the distinction made between
   great and small fevers (according to Galen); [1012] and of "fevers and
   dysentery," of which the father of Publius at Melita was healed (as
   Hippocrates uses fever in the plural). [1013]

   He was equally familiar with navigation, not indeed as a professional
   seaman, but as an experienced traveller and accurate observer. He uses
   no less than seventeen nautical terms with perfect accuracy. [1014] His
   description of the Voyage and Shipwreck of Paul in Acts 27-28, as
   explained and confirmed by a scholarly seaman, furnishes an
   irrefragable argument for the ability and credibility of the author of
   that book. [1015]

   Luke is fond of words of joy and gladness. [1016] He often mentions the
   Holy Spirit, and he is the only writer who gives us an account of the
   pentecostal miracle. [1017] Minor peculiarities are the use of the more
   correct limneof the lake of Galilee for thalassa, nomikosand
   nomodidaskalosfor grammateus, to eiremenonin quotations for rethen, nun
   phor arti, hesperafor opsia, the frequency of attraction of the
   relative pronoun and participial construction.

   There is a striking resemblance between the style of Luke and Paul,
   which corresponds to their spiritual sympathy and long intimacy. [1018]
   They agree in the report of the institution of the Lord's Supper, which
   is the oldest we have (from a.d. 57); both substitute: "This cup is the
   new covenant in My blood," for "This is My blood of the (new)
   covenant," and add: "This do in remembrance of Me" (Luke 22:19, 20; 1
   Cor. 11:24, 25). They are equally fond of words which characterize the
   freedom and universal destination of the gospel salvation. [1019] They
   have many terms in common which occur nowhere else in the New
   Testament. [1020] And they often meet in thought and expression in a
   way that shows both the close intimacy and the mutual independence of
   the two writers. [1021]

   Genuineness [1022]

   The genuineness of Luke is above reasonable doubt. The character of the
   Gospel agrees perfectly with what we might expect from the author as
   far as we know him from the Acts and the Epistles. No other writer
   answers the description.

   The external evidence is not so old and clear as that in favor of
   Matthew and Mark. Papias makes no mention of Luke. Perhaps he thought
   it unnecessary, because Luke himself in the preface gives an account of
   the origin and aim of his book. The allusions in Barnabas, Clement of
   Rome, and Hermas are vague and uncertain. But other testimonies are
   sufficient for the purpose. Irenaeus in Gaul says: "Luke, the companion
   of Paul, committed to writing the gospel preached by the latter." The
   Muratori fragment which contains the Italian traditions of the canon,
   mentions the Gospel of "Luke, the physician, whom Paul had associated
   with himself as one zealous for righteousness, to be his companion, who
   had not seen the Lord in the flesh, but having carried his inquiries as
   far back as possible, began his history with the birth of John." Justin
   Martyr makes several quotations from Luke, though he does not name him.
   [1023] This brings us up to the year 140 or 130. The Gospel is found in
   all ancient manuscripts and translations.

   The heretical testimony of Marcion from the year 140 is likewise
   conclusive. It was always supposed that his Gospel, the only one he
   recognized, was a mutilation of Luke, and this view is now confirmed
   and finally established by the investigations and concessions of the
   very school which for a short time had endeavored to reverse the order
   by making Marcion's caricature the original of Luke. [1024] The
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies and Recognitions quote from Luke. Basilides
   and Valentinus and their followers used all the four Gospels, and are
   reported to have quoted Luke 1:35 for their purpose.

   Celsus must have had Luke in view when he referred to the genealogy of
   Christ as being traced to Adam.

   Credibility.

   The credibility of Luke has been assailed on the ground that he shaped
   the history by his motive and aim to harmonize the Petrine and Pauline,
   or the Jewish-Christian and the Gentile-Christian parties of the
   church. But the same critics contradict themselves by discovering, on
   the other hand, strongly Judaizing and even Ebionitic elements in Luke,
   and thus make it an incoherent mosaic or clumsy patchwork of moderate
   Paulinism and Ebionism, or they arbitrarily assume different revisions
   through which it passed without being unified in plan.

   Against this misrepresentation we have to say: (1) An irenic spirit,
   such as we may freely admit in the writings of Luke, does not imply an
   alteration or invention of facts. On the contrary, it is simply an
   unsectarian, catholic spirit which aims at the truth and nothing but
   the truth, and which is the first duty and virtue of an historian. (2)
   Luke certainly did not invent those marvellous parables and discourses
   which have been twisted into subserviency to the tendency hypothesis;
   else Luke would have had a creative genius of the highest order, equal
   to that of Jesus himself, while he modestly professes to be simply a
   faithful collector of actual facts. (3) Paul himself did not invent his
   type of doctrine, but received it, according to his own solemn
   asseveration, by revelation from Jesus Christ, who called him to the
   apostleship of the Gentiles. (4) It is now generally admitted that the
   Tübingen hypothesis of the difference between the two types and parties
   in the apostolic church is greatly overstrained and set aside by Paul's
   own testimony in the Galatians, which is as irenic and conciliatory to
   the pillar-apostles as it is uncompromisingly polemic against the
   "false" brethren or the heretical Judaizers. (5) Some of the strongest
   anti-Jewish and pro-Gentile testimonies of Christ are found in Matthew
   and omitted by Luke. [1025]

   The accuracy of Luke has already been spoken of, and has been well
   vindicated by Godet against Renan in several minor details. "While
   remaining quite independent of the other three, the Gospel of Luke is
   confirmed and supported by them all."

   Time of Composition.

   There are strong indications that the third Gospel was composed (not
   published) between 58 and 63, before the close of Paul's Roman
   captivity. No doubt it took several years to collect and digest the
   material; and the book was probably not published, i.e., copied and
   distributed, till after the death of Paul, at the same time with the
   Acts, which forms the second part and is dedicated to the same patron.
   In this way the conflicting accounts of Clement of Alexandria and
   Irenaeus may be harmonized. [1026]

   1. Luke had the best leisure for literary composition during the four
   years of Paul's imprisonment at Caesarea and Rome. In Caesarea he was
   within easy reach of the surviving eyewitnesses and classical spots of
   the gospel history, and we cannot suppose that he neglected the
   opportunity.

   2. The Gospel was written before the book of Acts, which expressly
   refers to it as the first treatise inscribed to the same Theophilus
   (Acts 1:1). As the Acts come down to the second year of Paul's
   captivity in Rome, they cannot have been finished before a.d. 63; but
   as they abruptly break off without any mention of Paul's release or
   martyrdom, it seems quite probable that they were concluded before the
   fate of the apostle was decided one way or the other, unless the writer
   was, like Mark, prevented by some event, perhaps the Neronian
   persecution, from giving his book the natural conclusion. In its
   present shape it excites in the reader the greatest curiosity which
   could have been gratified with a few words, either that the apostle
   sealed his testimony with his blood, or that he entered upon new
   missionary tours East and West until at last he finished his course
   after a second captivity in Rome. I may add that the entire absence of
   any allusion in the Acts to any of Paul's Epistles can be easily
   explained by the assumption of a nearly contemporaneous composition,
   while it seems almost unaccountable if we assume an interval of ten or
   twenty years.

   3. Luke's ignorance of Matthew and probably also of Mark points
   likewise to an early date of composition. A careful investigator, like
   Luke, writing after the year 70, could hardly have overlooked, among
   his many written sources, such an important document as Matthew which
   the best critics put before a.d. 70.

   4. Clement of Alexandria has preserved a tradition that the Gospels
   containing the genealogies, i.e., Matthew and Luke, were written first.
   Irenaeus, it is true, puts the third Gospel after. Matthew and Mark and
   after the death of Peter and Paul, that is, after 64 (though certainly
   not after 70). If the Synoptic Gospels were written nearly
   simultaneously, we can easily account for these differences in the
   tradition. Irenaeus was no better informed on dates than Clement, and
   was evidently mistaken about the age of Christ and the date of the
   Apocalypse. But he may have had in view the time of publication, which
   must not be confounded with the date of composition. Many books
   nowadays are withheld from the market for some reason months or years
   after they have passed through the hands of the printer.

   The objections raised against such an early date are not well founded.
   [1027]

   The prior existence of a number of fragmentary Gospels implied in Luke
   1:1 need not surprise us; for such a story as that of Jesus of Nazareth
   must have set many pens in motion at a very early time. "Though the art
   of writing had not existed," says Lange, "it would have been invented
   for such a theme."

   Of more weight is the objection that Luke seems to have shaped the
   eschatological prophecies of Christ so as to suit the fulfilment by
   bringing in the besieging (Roman) army, and by interposing "the times
   of the Gentiles" between the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of
   the world (Luke 19:43, 44; 21:20-24). This would put the composition
   after the destruction of Jerusalem, say between 70 and 80, if not
   later. [1028] But such an intentional change of the words of our Lord
   is inconsistent with the unquestionable honesty of the historian and
   his reverence for the words of the Divine teacher. [1029] Moreover, it
   is not borne out by the facts. For the other Synoptists likewise speak
   of wars and the abomination of desolation in the holy place, which
   refers to the Jewish wars and the Roman eagles (Matt. 24:15; Mark
   13:14). Luke makes the Lord say:, Jerusalem shall be trodden down by
   the Gentiles till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" (Luke 21:24).
   But Matthew does the same when he reports that Christ predicted and
   commanded the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom in all parts of
   the world before the end can come (Matt. 24:14; 28:19; comp. Mark
   16:15). And even Paul said, almost in the same words as Luke, twelve
   years before the destruction of Jerusalem: "Blindness is happened to
   Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in" (Rom. 11:25). Must
   we therefore put the composition of Romans after a.d. 70? On the other
   hand, Luke reports as clearly as Matthew and Mark the words of Christ,
   that "this generation shall not pass away till all things" (the
   preceding prophecies) "shall be fulfilled" (Luke 21:32). Why did he not
   omit this passage if he intended to interpose a larger space of time
   between the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world?

   The eschatological discourses of our Lord, then, are essentially the
   same in all the Synoptists, and present the same difficulties, which
   can only be removed by assuming: (1) that they refer both to the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, two analogous
   events, the former being typical of the latter; (2) that the two
   events, widely distant in time, are represented in close proximity of
   space after the manner of prophetic vision in a panoramic picture. We
   must also remember that the precise date of the end of the world was
   expressly disclaimed even by the Son of God in the days of his
   humiliation (Matt. 24:36; Mark 13:32), and is consequently beyond the
   reach of human knowledge and calculation. The only difference is that
   Luke more clearly distinguishes the two events by dividing the
   prophetical discourses and assigning them to different occasions (Luke
   17:20-37 and 21:5-33); and here, as in other cases, he is probably more
   exact and in harmony with several hints of our Lord that a considerable
   interval must elapse between the catastrophe of Jerusalem and the final
   catastrophe of the world.

   Place of Composition.

   The third Gospel gives no hint as to the place of composition. Ancient
   tradition is uncertain, and modern critics are divided between Greece,
   [1030] Alexandria, [1031] Ephesus, [1032] Caesarea, [1033] Rome. [1034]
   It was probably written in sections during the longer residence of the
   author at Philippi, Caesarea, and Rome, but we cannot tell where it was
   completed and published. [1035]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [987] Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome erroneously supposed that Paul meant
   the written Gospel of Luke when he speaks of "my gospel," Rom. 2:16;
   16:25; 2 Tim. 2:8. The word gospel is not used in the New Test. in the
   sense of a written record, except in the titles which are of
   post-apostolic date; and the preface of Luke is inconsistent with the
   idea that he composed his work under the direction of any one man.

   [988] The name Loukas,Lucas, is abridged from lukanos .Lucanus or
   Lucilius (as Apollos from Apollonius, Silas from Silvanus). It is not
   to be confounded with Lucius, Acts 13:1; Rom. 16:21. The name was not
   common, but contractions in as were frequent in the names of slaves, as
   Lobeck observes. Dr. Plumptre (in his Com.)ingeniously conjectures that
   Luke was from the region of Lucania in Southern Italy, and called after
   the famous poet, M. Annaeus Lucanus, as his freedman. In this way be
   accounts for Luke's familiarity with Italian localities (Acts
   28:13-15), the favor of the uncle of Lucanus, J. Annaeus Gallic, shown
   to Paul (18:14-17), the tradition of the friendship between Paul and
   Seneca (a brother of Gallio), and the intended journey of Paul to Spain
   (Rom. 15:28), where Seneca and Lucanus were born (at Corduba). But the
   chronology is against this hypothesis. Lucanus was born a.d. 39, when
   Luke must have been already about thirty years of age, as he cannot
   have been much younger than Paul.

   [989] Jerome (Ep. ad Paulinum) says of Luke "Fuit medicus, et pariter
   omnia verba illius animae languentis sunt medicinae."

   [990] Comp. Gal. 4:13; 2 Cor. 1:9; 4:10, 12, 16; 12:7.

   [991] He is distinguished from "those of the circumcision," Col. 4:14;
   comp. 4:11.

   [992] Eusebius, III. 4: Loukas to men genos hon ton ap Antiocheias, ten
   epistemen de iatros , k. t. l. Jerome, De vir. ill, 7: "Lucas medicus
   Antiochensis ... sectator apostoli Pauli, et omnis peregrinationis ejus
   comes.

   [993] James Smith (l.c., p. 4) illustrates the argumentative bearing of
   this notice by the fact that of eight accounts of the Russian campaign
   of 1812, three by French, three by English, and two by scotch authors
   (Scott and Alison), the last two only make mention of the Scotch
   extraction of the Russian General Barclay de Tolly.

   [994] Jerome, De vir. ill., 7: "Sepultus est Constantinopoli, ad quam
   urbem vicesimo Constantii anno ossa eius cum reliquiis Andreae apostoli
   translata sunt."

   [995] Hence the ancient tradition that he was one of the Seventy
   Disciples, or one of the two disciples of Emmaus, cannot be true.

   [996] As the account of the stilling of the tempest, Luke 8:22-25,
   compared with Mark 4:35-41; and the parable of the wicked husbandman,
   Luke 20:9-19, compared with Mark 12:1-12.

   [997] Luke1:3: pasis--akribos--kathexes. Says Godet " Matthew groups
   together doctrinal teachings in the form of great discourses; he is a
   preacher. Mark narrates events as they occur to his mind; he is a
   chronicler. Luke reproduces the external and internal development of
   events; he is the historian, properly so called."

   [998] Luke 1:4: kratiste Theophile. In Acts 1:1 the epithet is omitted.
   Bengel infers from this omission that when Luke wrote the Acts he was
   on more familiar terms with Theophilus. The same title is applied to
   Governors Felix and Festus, Acts 23:26; 24:3; 20:25. The A. V. varies
   between "most excellent" and "most noble;" the R. V. uniformly renders
   "most excellent," which is apt to be applied to moral character rather
   than social position. "Honorable" or "most noble" would be preferable.
   Occasionally, however, the term is used also towards a personal friend
   (see passages in Wetstein).

   [999] For other conjectures on Theophilus, which locate him at
   Alexandria or at Rome or somewhere in Greece, see the Bible Dicts. of
   Winer and Smith sub Theophilus. Some have fancied that he was merely an
   ideal name for every right-minded reader of the Gospel, as a lover of
   truth.

   [1000] Luke 1:4: hina epignos peri on katechethes ten asphaleian.

   [1001] Luke 1:26; 4:31; 23:51; 24: 13 (Acts 1:12).

   [1002] For a full analysis of contents see Van Oosterzee, Com., 8-10;
   Westcott, Introd. to the G., 370-372 (Am. ed.); McClellan, Com. on N.
   T., I. 425-438; Farrar, Com., 31-36; Lange, Bibelkunde, 187-193.

   [1003] Lange (Leben Jesu, I. 258) gives as the theme of Luke: "the
   revelation of divine mercy;" Godet (Com.) "the manifestation of divine
   philanthropy" (Tit. 3:4); McClellan (I. 436): "salvation of sinners, by
   God's grace, through faith in Jesus Christ, and him crucified;" Farrar
   (p. 17): "who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed
   of the devil" (Acts 10:38, better suited for Mark); Van Oosterzee: "as
   Paul led the people of the Lord out of the bondage of the law into the
   enjoyment of gospel liberty, so did Luke raise sacred history from the
   standpoint of the Israelitish nationality to the higher and holier
   ground of universal humanity." .

   [1004] The term soter occurs, Luke 1: 47; 2:11; John 4:42, and often in
   the Acts and the Epistles of Paul, but neither in Matthew nor Mark;
   soteria occurs, Luke 1:69, 77; 19:9; John 4:22, and repeatedly in the
   Acts and the Epistles; soterios,Luke 2:30; 3:6; Acts 28:28; Eph. 6: 17;
   Tit. 2:11

   [1005] Luke 4:25-27; 9:52-56; 10:33; 15:11 sqq.; 17:19; 18:10; 19:5.

   [1006] See § 80, this vol.

   [1007] Lange (Bibelkunde, p. 187) calls it "das Evangelium des
   Menschensohnes, der Humanität Christi, der Verklärung aller Humanität."

   [1008] Farrar (p. 23) calls Luke "the first Christian hymnologist"
   (better hymnist), and quotes the lines from Keble: "Thou hast an ear
   for angel songs,
   A breath the gospel trump to fill, And taught by thee the Church
   prolongs
   Her hymns of high thanksgiving still."

   [1009] This is the judgment of Renan, which is worth preserving in
   full. "L'Evangile de Luc," he says (in Les Evangiles, p. 282 and 283),
   "est le plus littéraire des évangiles. Tout y révèle un esprit large et
   doux, sage, modéré, sobre et raisonnable dans l'irrationnel. Ses
   exagérations, ses invraisemblances, ses inconséquences tiennent à la
   nature même de la parabole et en font le charme. Matthieu arrondit les
   contours un peu secs de Marc. Luc fait bien plus;il écrit, il montre
   une vraie entente de la composition. Son livre est un beau récit bien
   suivi, à la fois hébraîque et hellénique, joignant l'émotion du drama à
   la sérènité de l'idylle. Tout y rit, tout y pleure, tout y chante;
   partout des larmes et des cantiques; c'est l'hymne du peuple nouveau,
   L'hosanna des petits et des humbles introduits dans le royaume de Dieu.
   Un esprit de sainte enfance, de joie, de ferveur, le sentiment
   évangélique dans son originalité première répandent sur toute la
   légende une teinte d'une incomparable douceur. On ne fut jamais moins
   sectaire. Pas un reproche, pas un mot dur pour le vieux peuple exclu;
   son exclusion ne le punit-elle pas assez ? C'est le plus beau livre
   qu'il y ait. Le plaisir que l'auteur dut avoir à l'écrire ne sera
   jamais suffisamment compris."

   [1010] Jerome, who had a great genius for language, says, Epist. ad
   Dam., 20 (145): "Lucas qui inter omnes evangelistas Graeci sermonis
   eruditissimus fuit, quippe et medicus, et qui Evangelium Graecis
   scripserit." in another passage he says that Luke's "sermo saecularem
   redolet eloqueiatiam."

   [1011] See the Version of Delitzsch in his Hebrew New Testament,
   published by the Brit. and For. Bible Society.

   [1012] Luke 4:38: hen sunechomene pureto megalo. sunechomeneis likewise
   a medical term.

   [1013] Acts 28:8: puretois kai dusenterio sunechomenon . Other
   instances of medical knowledge are found in Luke 8:46; 22:44; Acts 3:7;
   9:18; 10:9, 10. Dr. Plumptre even traces several expressions of Paul
   such as "healthy doctrine" (1 Tim. 1:10; 6 3), " gangrene" or " cancer"
   (2 Tim. 2:17), the conscience " seared," or rather " cauterized"(1 Tim.
   4:2), and the recommendation of a little wine for the stomach's sake (1
   Tim. 5:23), to the influence of " the beloved physician," who
   administered to him in his peculiar physical infirmities. Rather
   fanciful. Rev. W. K. Hobart, of Trinity College, Dublin, published a
   work (1882) on The Medical Language of St. Luke, in which he furnished
   the proof from internal evidence that the Gospel of Luke and the Acts
   of the Apostles were written by the same person, and that the writer
   was a medical man. He has compared over four hundred peculiar words and
   phrases of these books with the use of the same words in Hippocrates,
   Aretaeus, Dioscorides, and Galen.

   [1014] Among these are seven compounds of pleo, describing the motion
   and management of a ship, as follows: pleo, to sail, Luke 8:23; Acts
   21:3; 27:6, 24. apopleo, to sail from, Acts 13:4; 14:26; 20:15;
   27:1.braduploeo (from bradus, slow), to sail slowly, Acts 27:7.
   diapleo, to sail through (not " over," as in the A. V.), Acts 27:5.
   ekpleo, to sail away, Acts 15:39; 18:18; 20:6. katapleo, to arrive,
   Luke 8:26. hupopleo, to sail under the lee, Acts 27:4, 7. parapleo, to
   sail by, Acts 20:16. Add to these the following nautical terms:
   hanagomai, to get under way, to put to sea, Acts 27:4. diaperao to sail
   over, Acts 21:2. diapheromai, to be driven to and fro, Acts 27:27.
   epikello, to run the ship ashore, Acts 27:41. euthudromeo , to make a
   straight course, Acts 16:11; 21:1. paralegomai (middle), to sail by,
   Acts 27:8, 13. hupotrecho (aor. 2, hupedramon), to run under the lee,
   Acts 27:16. pheromai (pass.), to be driven, Acts 27:15, 17. Also,
   ekbolen epoiounto, Acts 27:18, and ekouphizon to ploion, 27:38, which
   are technical terms for lightening the ship by throwing cargo
   overboard.

   the Acts, which is the Gospel of the Holy Spirit.

   [1018] See Holtzmann, Syn. Evang., pp. 316-324, copied in part (without
   acknowledgment) by Davidson, Introd., I. 437 sqq. Holtzmann enumerates
   about two hundred expressions or phrases common to Luke and Paul, and

   sqq.

   [1023] Freely admitted by Zeller, Davidson (I. 444), and others of that
   school.

   [1024] Even the author of "Supernatural Religion" was forced at last to
   surrender to the arguments of Dr. Sanday, in 1875, after the question
   had already been settled years before in Germany by Hilgenfeld (1850)
   and Volkmar (1852). Davidson also (Introd., new ed., I. 446) admits:
   "There is no doubt that Marcion had the Gospel of Luke, which he
   adapted to his own ideas by arbitrary treatment. He lived before
   Justin, about a.d. 140, and is the earliest writer from whom we learn
   the existence of the Gospel."

   [1025] Davidson still adheres to this exploded Tübingen view in his new
   edition (I. 467): "Luke wished to bring Judaism [sic!] and Paulinism
   together in the sphere of comprehensive Christianity, where the former
   would merge into the latter. In conformity with this purpose, he
   describes the irreconcilable opposition between Jesus and his
   opponents." As if Matthew and Mark and John did not precisely the same
   thing. He even repeats the absurd fiction of Baur, which was refuted
   long ago, not only by Godet, but even in part at least by Zeller,
   Holtzmann, and Keim, that Luke had "the obvious tendency to depreciate
   the twelve, in comparison with the seventy" (p. 469). Baur derived the
   chief proof of an alleged hostility of Luke to Peter from his omission
   of the famous passage, "Thou art Rock;" but Mark omits it likewise; and
   Luke, on the other hand, is the only Evangelist who records the word of
   Christ to Peter, Luke 22:32, on which the Romanists base the dogma of
   papal infallibility.

   [1026] The critics differ widely as to the date of composition: (1) For
   a date prior to a.d. 70 are all the older divines, also Lange, Ebrard,
   Guericke, van Oosterzee, Godet (60-67), Thiersch (58-60), Alford (58),
   Riddle (60). (2) For a date between 70 and 90: De Wette, Bleek, Reuss,
   Holtzmann, Güder, Meyer, Weiss (70-80), Keim, Abbott (80-90). (3) For
   a.d. 100 and later: Hilgenfeld and Volkmar (100), Zeller and Davidson
   (100-110). The date of Baur, a.d. 140, is perfectly wild and made
   impossible by the clear testimonies of Justin Martyr and Marcion. Hence
   he was unwilling to retract in toto his former view about the priority
   of Marcion's Gospel, though he felt obliged to do it in part
   (Kirchengesch. I. 75 and 78).

   [1027] Dr. Abbott, of London (in "Enc. Brit.," X. 813, of the ninth
   ed., 1879), discovers no less than ten reasons for the later date of
   Luke, eight of them in the preface alone: "(1) the pre-existence and
   implied failure of many 'attempts' to set forth continuous narratives
   of the things 'surely believed;' (2) the mention of 'tradition' of the
   eye-witnesses and ministers of the word as past, not as present
   (paredosan , Luke 1:2); (3) the dedication of the Gospel to a man of
   rank (fictitious or otherwise), who is supposed to have been
   'catechized' in Christian truth; (4) the attempt at literary style and
   at improvement of the 'usus ecclesiasticus' of the common tradition;
   (5) the composition of something like a commencement of a Christian
   hymnology; (6) the development of the genealogy and the higher tone of
   the narrative of the incarnation; (7) the insertion of many passages
   mentioning our Lord as ho kurios not in address, but in narrative; (8)
   the distinction, more sharply drawn, between the fall of Jerusalem and
   the final coming; (9) the detailed prediction of the fall of Jerusalem,
   implying reminiscences of its fulfilment; (10) the very great
   development of the manifestations of Jesus after the resurrection. The
   inference from all this evidence would be that Luke was not written
   till about a.d. 80 at earliest. If it could be further demonstrated
   that Luke used any Apocryphal book (Judith, for example), and if it
   could be shown that the book in question was written after a certain
   date (Renan suggests a.d. 80 for the date of the book of Judith), it
   might be necessary to place Luke much later; but no such demonstration
   has been hitherto produced." But most of these arguments are set aside
   by the hemin in Luke 1:2, which includes the writer among those who
   heard the gospel story from the eye-witnesses of the life of Christ. It
   is also evident from the Acts that the writer, who is identical with
   the third Evangelist, was an intimate companion of Paul, and hence
   belonged to the first generation of disciples, which includes all the
   converts of the apostles from the day of Pentecost down to the
   destruction of Jerusalem.

   [1028] Keim (I. 70) thus eloquently magnifies this little difference:
   "Anders als dem Matthaeus steht diesem Schrifstellen [Lukas] das
   Wirklichkeitsbild der Katastrophe der heiligen Stadt in seiner ganzen
   schrecklichen Grösse vor der Seele, die langwierige und kunstvolle
   Belagerung des Feindes, die Heere, die befestigten Lager, der Ring der
   Absperrung, die tausend Bedrängnisse, die Blutarbeit des Schwerts, die
   Gefangenführung des Volkes, der Tempel, die Stadt dem Boden gleich,
   Alles unter dem ernsten Gesichtspunkt eines Strafgerichtes Gottes für
   die dung des Gesandten. Ja über die Katastrophe hinaus, die äusserste
   Perspektive des ersten Evangelisten, dehnt sich dem neuen
   Geschichtschreiber eine new unbestimmbar grosse Periode der Trümmerlage
   Jerusalemz unter dem ehernen Tritt der Heiden und heidnischer
   Weltzeiten, innerhalb deren er selber schreibt. Unter solchen Umständen
   hat die grosse Zukunftrede Jesu bei aller Sorgfalt, die wesentlichen
   Züge, sogar die Wiederkunft in diesem 'Geschlect'zu halten die
   mannigfaltigsten Aenderungen erlitten." The same argument is urged more
   soberly by Holtzmann (Syn. Evang., 406 sq.), and even by Güder (in
   Herzog, IX. 19) and Weiss (in Meyer, 6th ed., p. 243), but they assume
   that Luke wrote only a few years after Matthew.

   [1029] "It is psychologically impossible," says Godet (p. 543), "that
   Luke should have indulged in manipulating at pleasure the sayings of
   that Being on whom his faith was fixed, whom he regarded as the Son of
   God."

   The best comes last. The fourth Gospel is the Gospel of Gospels, the
   holy of holies in the New Testament. The favorite disciple and bosom
   friend of Christ, the protector of his mother, the survivor of the
   apostolic age was pre-eminently qualified by nature and grace to give
   to the church the inside view of that most wonderful person that ever
   walked on earth. In his early youth he had absorbed the deepest words
   of his Master, and treasured them in a faithful heart; in extreme old
   age, yet with the fire and vigor of manhood, he reproduced them under
   the influence of the Holy Spirit who dwelt in him and led him, as well
   as the other disciples, into "the whole truth."

   His Gospel is the golden sunset of the age of inspiration, and sheds
   its lustre into the second and all succeeding centuries of the church.
   It was written at Ephesus when Jerusalem lay in ruins, when the church
   had finally separated from the synagogue, when "the Jews" and the
   Christians were two distinct races, when Jewish and Gentile believers
   had melted into a homogeneous Christian community, a little band in a
   hostile world, yet strong in faith, full of hope and joy, and certain
   of victory.

   For a satisfactory discussion of the difficult problems involved in
   this Gospel and its striking contrast with the Synoptic Gospels, we
   must keep in view the fact that Christ communed with the apostles after
   as well as before his visible departure, and spoke to them through that
   "other Advocate" whom he sent to them from the Father, and who brought
   to remembrance all things he had said unto them. [1036] Here lies the
   guarantee of the truthfulness of a picture which no human artist could
   have drawn without divine inspiration. Under any other view the fourth
   Gospel, and indeed the whole New Testament, becomes the strangest
   enigma in the history of literature and incapable of any rational
   solution.

   John and the Synoptists.

   If John wrote long after the Synoptists, we could, of course, not
   expect from him a repetition of the story already so well told by three
   independent witnesses. But what is surprising is the fact that, coming
   last, he should produce the most original of all the Gospels.

   The transition from Matthew to Mark, and from Mark to Luke is easy and
   natural; but in passing from any of the Synoptists to the fourth Gospel
   we breathe a different atmosphere, and feel as if we were suddenly
   translated from a fertile valley to the height of a mountain with a
   boundless vision over new scenes of beauty and grandeur. We look in
   vain for a genealogy of Jesus, for an account of his birth, for the
   sermons of the Baptist, for the history of the temptation in the
   wilderness, the baptism in the Jordan, and the transfiguration on the
   Mount, for a list of the Twelve, for the miraculous cures of demoniacs.
   John says nothing of the institution of the church and the sacraments;
   though he is full of the mystical union and communion which is the
   essence of the church, and presents the spiritual meaning of baptism
   and the Lord's Supper (John 3 and John 6). He omits the ascension,
   though it is promised through Mary Magdalene (20:17). He has not a word
   of the Sermon on the Mount, and the Lord's Prayer, none of the
   inimitable parables about the kingdom of heaven, none of those telling
   answers to the entangling questions of the Pharisees. He omits the
   prophecies of the downfall of Jerusalem and the end of the world, and
   most of those proverbial, moral sentences and maxims of surpassing
   wisdom which are strung together by the Synoptists like so many
   sparkling diamonds.

   But in the place of these Synoptical records John gives us an abundance
   of new matter of equal, if not greater, interest and importance. Right
   at the threshold we are startled, as by a peal of thunder from the
   depths, of eternity: "In the beginning was the Word." And as we proceed
   we hear about the creation of the world, the shining of the true light
   in darkness, the preparatory revelations, the incarnation of the Logos,
   the testimony of the Baptist to the Lamb of God. We listen with
   increasing wonder to those mysterious discourses about the new birth of
   the Spirit, the water of life, the bread of life from heaven, about the
   relation of the eternal and only-begotten Son to the Father, to the
   world, and to believers, the mission of the Holy Spirit, the promise of
   the many mansions in heaven, the farewell to the disciples, and at last
   that sacerdotal prayer which brings us nearest to the throne and the
   beating heart of God. John alone reports the interviews with Nicodemus,
   the woman of Samaria, and the Greek foreigners. He records six miracles
   not mentioned by the Synoptists, and among them the two greatest--the
   changing of water into wine and the raising of Lazarus from the grave.
   And where he meets the Synoptists, as in the feeding of the five
   thousand, he adds the mysterious discourse on the spiritual feeding of
   believers by the bread of life which has been going on ever since. He
   makes the nearest approach to his predecessors in the closing chapters
   on the betrayal, the denial of Peter, the trial before the
   ecclesiastical and civil tribunals, the crucifixion and resurrection,
   but even here he is more exact and circumstantial, and adds,
   interesting details which bear the unmistakable marks of personal
   observation.

   He fills out the ministry of Christ in Judaea, among the hierarchy and
   the people of Jerusalem, and extends it over three years; while the
   Synoptists seem to confine it to one year and dwell chiefly on his
   labors among the peasantry of Galilee. But on close inspection John
   leaves ample room for the Galilaean, and the Synoptists for the Judaean
   ministry. None of the Gospels is a complete biography. John expressly
   disclaims, this (20:31). Matthew implies repeated visits to the holy
   city when he makes Christ exclaim: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem ... how
   often would I have gathered thy children together" (23:37; comp.
   27:57). On the other hand John records several miracles in Cana,
   evidently only as typical examples of many (2:1 sqq.; 4:47 sqq.; 6:1
   sqq.). But in Jerusalem the great conflict between light and darkness,
   belief and unbelief, was most fully developed and matured to the final
   crisis; and this it was one of his chief objects to describe.

   The differences between John and the Synoptists are many and great, but
   there are no contradictions.

   The Occasion.

   Irenaeus, who, as a native of Asia Minor and a spiritual grand-pupil of
   John, is entitled to special consideration, says: "Afterward" [i.e.,
   after Matthew, Mark, and Luke] "John, the disciple of the Lord, who
   also had leaned upon his breast, did himself publish a Gospel during
   his residence at Ephesus in Asia." [1037] In another place he makes the
   rise of the Gnostic heresy the prompting occasion of the composition.
   [1038]

   A curious tradition, which probably contains a grain of truth, traces
   the composition to a request of John's fellow-disciples and elders of
   Ephesus. "Fast with me," said John, according to the Muratorian
   fragment (170), "for three days from this time" [when the request was
   made], "and whatever shall be revealed to each of us" [concerning my
   composing the Gospel], "let us relate it to one another. On the same
   night it was revealed to Andrew, one of the apostles, that John should
   relate all things in his own name, aided by the revision of all. [1039]
   ... What wonder is it then that John brings forward every detail with
   so much emphasis, even in his Epistles, saying of himself, What we have
   seen with our eyes, and heard with our ears, and our hands have
   handled, these things have we written unto you. For so he professes
   that he was not only an eyewitness, but also a hearer, and moreover a
   writer of all the wonderful works of the Lord in their historical
   order." [1040]

   The mention of Andrew in this fragment is remarkable, for he was
   associated with John as a pupil of the Baptist and as the first called
   to the school of Christ (John 1:35-40). He was also prominent in other
   ways and stood next to the beloved three, or even next to his brother
   Peter in the catalogues of the apostles. [1041]

   Victorinus of Pettau (d. about 304), in the Scholia on the Apocalypse,
   says that John wrote the Gospel after the Apocalypse, in consequence of
   the spread of the Gnostic heresy and at the request of "all the bishops
   from the neighboring provinces." [1042]

   Jerome, on the basis of a similar tradition, reports that John, being
   constrained by his brethren to write, consented to do so if all joined
   in a fast and prayer to God, and after this fast, being saturated with
   revelation (revelatione saturatus), he indited the heaven-sent preface:
   "In the beginning was the Word." [1043]

   Possibly those fellow-disciples and pupils who prompted John to write
   his Gospel, were the same who afterward added their testimony to the
   genuineness of the book, speaking in the plural ("we know that his
   witness is true," 21:24), one of them acting as scribe ("I suppose,"
   21:25).

   The outward occasion does not exclude, of course, the inward prompting
   by the Holy Spirit, which is in fact implied in this tradition, but it
   shows how far the ancient church was from such a mechanical theory of
   inspiration as ignores or denies the human and natural factors in the
   composition of the apostolic writings. The preface of Luke proves the
   same.

   The Object.

   The fourth Gospel does not aim at a complete biography of Christ, but
   distinctly declares that Jesus wrought "many other signs in the
   presence of the disciples which are not written in this book" (John
   20:30; comp. 21:25).

   The author plainly states his object, to which all other objects must
   be subordinate as merely incidental, namely, to lead his readers to the
   faith "that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing
   they may have life in his name" (20:31). This includes three points:
   (1) the Messiahship of Jesus, which was of prime importance to the
   Jews, and was the sole or at least the chief aim of Matthew, the Jewish
   Evangelist; (2) the Divine Sonship of Jesus, which was the point to be
   gained with the Gentiles, and which Luke, the Gentile Evangelist, had
   also in view; (3) the practical benefit of such faith, to gain true,
   spiritual, eternal life in Him and through Him who is the personal
   embodiment and source of eternal life.

   To this historico-didactic object all others which have been mentioned
   must be subordinated. The book is neither polemic and apologetic, nor
   supplementary, nor irenic, except incidentally and unintentionally as
   it serves all these purposes. The writer wrote in full view of the
   condition and needs of the church at the close of the first century,
   and shaped his record accordingly, taking for granted a general
   knowledge of the older Gospels, and refuting indirectly, by the
   statement of facts and truths, the errors of the day. Hence there is
   some measure of truth in those theories which have made an incidental
   aim the chief or only aim of the book.

   1. The anti-heretical theory was started by Irenaeus. Being himself
   absorbed in the controversy with Gnosticism and finding the strongest
   weapons in John, he thought that John's motive was to root out the
   error of Cerinthus and of the Nicolaitans by showing that "there is one
   God who made all things by his word; and not, as they say, one who made
   the world, and another, the Father of the Lord." [1044] Jerome adds the
   opposite error of Ebionism, Ewald that of the disciples of the Baptist.

   No doubt the fourth Gospel, by the positive statement of the truth, is
   the most effective refutation of Gnostic dualism and doketism, which
   began to raise its head in Asia Minor toward the close of the first
   century. It shows the harmony of the ideal Christ of faith and the real
   Christ of history, which the ancient and modern schools of Gnosticism
   are unable to unite in one individual. But it is not on this account a
   polemical treatise, and it even had by its profound speculation a
   special attraction for Gnostics and philosophical rationalists, from
   Basilides down to Baur. The ancient Gnostics made the first use of it
   and quoted freely from the prologue, e.g., the passage: "The true
   light, which enlighteneth every man, was coming into the world" (1:9).
   [1045]

   The polemical aim is more apparent in the first Epistle of John, which
   directly warns against the anti-Christian errors then threatening the
   church, and may be called a doctrinal and practical postscript to the
   Gospel.

   2. The supplementary theory. Clement of Alexandria (about 200) states,
   on the authority of "presbyters of an earlier generation," that John,
   at the request of his friends and the prompting of the divine Spirit,
   added a spiritual Gospel to the older bodily Gospels which set forth
   the outward facts. [1046] The distinction is ingenious. John is more
   spiritual and ideal than the Synoptists, and he represents as it were
   the esoteric tradition as distinct from the exoteric tradition of the
   church. Eusebius records also as a current opinion that John intended
   to supply an amount of the earlier period of Christ's ministry which
   was omitted by the other Evangelists. [1047] John is undoubtedly a most
   welcome supplementer both in matter and spirit, and furnishes in part
   the key for the full understanding of the Synoptists, yet he repeats
   many important events, especially in the closing chapters, and his
   Gospel is as complete as any. [1048]

   3. The Irenic tendency-theory is a modern Tübingen invention. It is
   assumed that the fourth Gospel is purely speculative or theological,
   the last and crowning literary production which completed the process
   of unifying Jewish and Gentile Christianity and melting them into the
   one Catholic church of the second century.

   No doubt it is an Irenicon of the church in the highest and best sense
   of the term, and a prophecy of the church of the future, when all
   discords of Christendom past and present will be harmonized in the
   perfect union of Christians with Christ, which is the last object of
   his sacerdotal prayer. But it is not an Irenicon at the expense of
   truth and facts.

   In carrying out their hypothesis the Tübingen critics have resorted to
   the wildest fictions. It is said that the author depreciated the Mosaic
   dispensation and displayed jealousy of Peter. How in the world could
   this promote peace? It would rather have defeated the object. But there
   is no shadow of proof for such an assertion. While the author opposes
   the unbelieving Jews, he shows the highest reverence for the Old
   Testament, and derives salvation from the Jews. Instead of showing
   jealousy of Peter, he introduces his new name at the first interview
   with Jesus (1:42), reports his great confession even more fully than
   Matthew (John 6:68, 69), puts him at the head of the list of the
   apostles (21:2), and gives him his due prominence throughout down to
   the last interview when the risen Lord committed to him the feeding of
   his sheep (21:15-19). This misrepresentation is of a piece with the
   other Tübingen myth adopted by Renan, that the real John in the
   Apocalypse pursues a polemical aim against Paul and deliberately
   excludes him from the rank of the twelve Apostles. And yet Paul
   himself, in the acknowledged Epistle to the Galatians, represents John
   as one of the three pillar-apostles who recognized his peculiar gift
   for the apostolate of the Gentiles and extended to him the right hand
   of fellowship.

   Analysis.

   The object of John determined the selection and arrangement of the
   material. His plan is more clear and systematic than that of the
   Synoptists. It brings out the growing conflict between belief and
   unbelief, between light and darkness, and leads step by step to the
   great crisis of the cross, and to the concluding exclamation of Thomas,
   "My Lord and my God."

   In the following analysis the sections peculiar to John are marked by a
   star.

   Characteristics of the Fourth Gospel.

   The Gospel of John is the most original, the most important, the most
   influential book in all literature. The great Origen called it the
   crown of the Gospels, as the Gospels are the crown of all sacred
   writings. [1049] It is pre-eminently the spiritual and ideal, though at
   the same time a most real Gospel, the truest transcript of the
   original. It lifts the veil from the holy of holies and reveals the
   glory of the Only Begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. It
   unites in harmony the deepest knowledge and the purest love of Christ.
   We hear as it were his beating heart; we lay our hands in his
   wound-prints and exclaim with doubting Thomas: "My Lord and my God." No
   book is so plain and yet so deep, so natural and yet so full of
   mystery. It is simple as a child and sublime as a seraph, gentle as a
   lamb and bold as an eagle, deep as the sea and high as the heavens.

   It has been praised as "the unique, tender, genuine Gospel," "written
   by the hand of an angel," as "the heart of Christ," as "God's
   love-letter to the world," or "Christ's love-letter to the church." It
   has exerted an irresistible charm on many of the strongest and noblest
   minds in Christendom, as Origen in Egypt, Chrysostom in Asia, Augustin
   in Africa, the German Luther, the French Calvin, the poetic Herder, the
   critical Schleiermacher, and a multitude of less famous writers of all
   schools and shades of thought. Even many of those who doubt or deny the
   apostolic authorship cannot help admiring its more than earthly
   beauties. [1050]

   But there are other sceptics who find the Johannean discourses
   monotonous, tedious, nebulous, unmeaning, hard, and feel as much
   offended by them as the original hearers. [1051]

   Let us point out the chief characteristics of this book which
   distinguish it from the Synoptical Gospels.

   1. The fourth Gospel is the Gospel of the Incarnation, that is, of the
   perfect union of the divine and human in the person of Jesus of
   Nazareth, who for this very reason is the Saviour of the world and the
   fountain of eternal life. "The Word became flesh." This is the
   theoretical theme. The writer begins with the eternal pre-existence of
   the Logos, and ends with the adoration of his incarnate divinity in the
   exclamation of the sceptical Thomas: "My Lord and my God!" Luke's
   preface is historiographic and simply points to his sources of
   information; John's prologue is metaphysical and dogmatic, and sounds
   the keynote of the subsequent history. The Synoptists begin with the
   man Jesus and rise up to the recognition of his Messiahship and divine
   Sonship; John descends from the pre-existent Son of God through the
   preparatory revelations to his incarnation and crucifixion till he
   resumes the glory which he had before the world began. The former give
   us the history of a divine man, the latter the history of a human God.
   Not that he identifies him with the Godhead (ho theos); on the
   contrary, he clearly distinguishes the Son and the Father and makes him
   inferior in dignity ("the Father is greater than I"); but he declares
   that the Son is "God" (theos), that is, of divine essence or nature.

   And yet there is no contradiction here between the Evangelists except
   for those who deem a union of the Divine and human in one person an
   impossibility. The Christian Church has always felt that the Synoptic
   and the Johannean Christ are one and the same, only represented from
   different points of view. And in this judgment the greatest scholars
   and keenest critics, from Origen down to the present time, have
   concurred.

   For, on the one hand, John's Christ is just as real and truly human as
   that of the Synoptists. He calls himself the Son of man and "a man"
   (John 8:40); he "groaned in the spirit" (11:33), he "wept" at the grave
   of a friend (11:35), and his "soul" was "troubled" in the prospect of
   the dark hour of crucifixion (12:27) and the crime of the traitor
   (13:1). The Evangelist attests with solemn emphasis from what he saw
   with his own eyes that Jesus truly suffered and died (19:33-35). [1052]

   The Synoptic Christ, on the other hand, is as truly elevated above
   ordinary mortals as the Johannean. It is true, he does not in so many
   words declare his pre-existence as in John 1:1; 6:62; 8:58; 17:5, 24,
   but it is implied, or follows as a legitimate consequence. He is
   conceived without sin, a descendant of David, and yet the Lord of David
   (Matt. 22:41); he claims authority to forgive sins, for which he is
   accused of blasphemy by the Jews (quite consistently from their
   standpoint of unbelief); he gives his life a ransom for the redemption
   of the world; he will come in his glory and judge all nations; yea, in
   the very Sermon on the Mount, which all schools of Rationalists accept
   his genuine teaching, He declares himself to be the judge of the world
   (Matt. 7:21-23; comp. 25:31-46), and in the baptismal formula He
   associates himself and the Holy Spirit with the eternal Father, as the
   connecting link between the two, thus assuming a place on the very
   throne of the Deity (28:19). It is impossible to rise higher. Hence
   Matthew, the Jewish Evangelist, does not hesitate to apply to Him the
   name Immanuel, that is, "God with us"(1:23). Mark gives us the Gospel
   of Peter, the first who confessed that Jesus is not only "the Christ"
   in his official character, but also "the Son of the living God." This
   is far more than a son; it designates his unique personal relation to
   God and forms the eternal basis of his historical Messiahship (Matt.
   16:16; comp. 26:63). The two titles are distinct, and the high priest's
   charge of blasphemy (26:65) could only apply to the latter. A false
   Messiah would be an impostor, not a blasphemer. We could not substitute
   the Messiah for the Son in the baptismal formula. Peter, Mark, and
   Matthew were brought up in the most orthodox monotheism, with an
   instinctive horror of the least approach to idolatry, and yet they
   looked up to their Master with feelings of adoration. And, as for Luke,
   he delights in representing Jesus throughout as the sinless Saviour of
   sinners, and is in full sympathy with the theology of his elder brother
   Paul, who certainly taught the pre-existence and divine nature of
   Christ several years before the Gospels were written or published (Rom.
   1:3, 4; 9:5; 2 Cor. 8:9; Col. 1:15-17; Phil. 2:6-11).

   2. It is the Gospel of Love. Its practical motto is: "God is love." In
   the incarnation of the eternal Word, in the historic mission of his
   Son, God has given the greatest possible proof of his love to mankind.
   In the fourth Gospel alone we read that precious sentence which
   contains the very essence of Christianity: "God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him
   should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:16). It is the Gospel
   of the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep (10:11); the
   Gospel of the new commandment: "Love one another" (13:34). And this was
   the last exhortation of the aged disciple "whom Jesus loved."

   But for this very reason that Christ is the greatest gift of God to the
   world, unbelief is the greatest sin and blackest ingratitude, which
   carries in it its own condemnation. The guilt of unbelief, the contrast
   between faith and unbelief is nowhere set forth in such strong light as
   in the fourth Gospel. It is a consuming fire to all enemies of Christ.

   3. It is the Gospel of Mystic Symbolism. [1053] The eight miracles it
   records are significant "signs" (semeia) which symbolize the character
   and mission of Christ, and manifest his glory. They are simply his
   "works" (erga), the natural manifestations of his marvellous person
   performed with the same ease as men perform their ordinary works. The
   turning of water into wine illustrates his transforming power, and
   fitly introduces his public ministry; the miraculous feeding of the
   five thousand set him forth as the Bread of life for the spiritual
   nourishment of countless believers; the healing of the man born blind,
   as the Light of the world; the raising of Lazarus, as the Resurrection
   and the Life. The miraculous draught of fishes shows the disciples to
   be fishers of men, and insures the abundant results of Christian labor
   to the end of time. The serpent in the wilderness prefigured the cross.
   The Baptist points to him as the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin
   of the world. He represents himself under the significant figures of
   the Door, the good Shepherd, the Vine; and these figures have inspired
   Christian art and poetry, and guided the meditations of the church ever
   since.

   The whole Old Testament is a type and prophecy of the New. "The law was
   given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (1:17). Herein
   lies the vast superiority of Christianity, and yet the great importance
   of Judaism as an essential part in the scheme of redemption. Clearly
   and strongly as John brings out the opposition to the unbelieving Jews,
   he is yet far from going to the Gnostic extreme of rejecting or
   depreciating the Old Testament; on the contrary "salvation comes from
   the Jews" (says Christ to the Samaritan woman, 4:22); and turning the
   Scripture argument against the scribes and Pharisees who searched the
   letter of the Scriptures, but ignored the spirit, Christ confronts them
   with the authority of Moses on whom they fixed their hope. "If ye
   believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. But ye believe
   not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?" (5:46). John sees
   Christ everywhere in those ancient Scriptures which cannot be broken.
   He unfolds the true Messianic idea in conflict with the carnal
   perversion of it among the Jews under the guidance of the hierarchy.

   The Johannean and Synoptic Discourses of Christ.

   4. John gives prominence to the transcendent Discourses about the
   person of Christ and his relation to the Father, to the world, and the
   disciples. His words are testimonies, revealing the inner glory of his
   person; they are Spirit and they are life.

   Matthew's Gospel is likewise didactic; but there is a marked difference
   between the contents and style of the Synoptic and the Johannean
   discourses of Jesus. The former discuss the nature of the Messianic
   kingdom, the fulfilment of the law, the duty of holy obedience, and are
   popular, practical, brief, pointed, sententious, parabolic, and
   proverbial; the latter touch the deepest mysteries of theology and
   Christology, are metaphysical, lengthy, liable to carnal
   misunderstanding, and scarcely discernible from John's own style in the
   prologue and the first Epistle, and from that used by the Baptist. The
   transition is almost imperceptible in John 3:16 and 3:31.

   Here we reach the chief difficulty in the Johannean problem. Here is
   the strong point of sceptical criticism. We must freely admit at the
   outset that John so reproduced the words of his Master as to mould them
   unconsciously into his own type of thought and expression. He revolved
   them again and again in his heart, they were his daily food, and the
   burden of his teaching to the churches from Sunday to Sunday; yet he
   had to translate, to condense, to expand, and to apply them; and in
   this process it was unavoidable that his own reflections should more or
   less mingle with his recollections. With all the tenacity of his memory
   it was impossible that at such a great interval of time (fifty or sixty
   years after the events) he should be able to record literally every
   discourse just as it was spoken; and he makes no such claim, but
   intimates that he selects and summarizes.

   This is the natural view of the case, and the same concession is now
   made by all the champions of the Johannean authorship who do not hold
   to a magical inspiration theory and turn the sacred writers into
   unthinking machines, contrary to their own express statements, as in
   the Preface of Luke. But we deny that this concession involves any
   sacrifice of the truth of history or of any lineament from the
   physiognomy of Christ. The difficulty here presented is usually
   overstated by the critics, and becomes less and less, the higher we
   rise in our estimation of Christ, and the closer we examine the
   differences in their proper connection. The following reflections will
   aid the student:

   (1) In the first place we must remember the marvellous heighth and
   depth and breadth of Christ's intellect as it appears in the Synoptists
   as well as in John. He commanded the whole domain of religious and
   moral truth; he spake as never man spake, and the people were
   astonished at his teaching (Matt. 7:28, 29; Mark 1:22; 6:2; Luke 4:32;
   John 7:46). He addressed not only his own generation, but through it
   all ages and classes of men. No wonder that his hearers often
   misunderstood him. The Synoptists give examples of such
   misunderstanding as well as John (comp. Mark 8:16). But who will set
   limits to his power and paedagogic wisdom in the matter and form of his
   teaching? Must he not necessarily have varied his style when he
   addressed the common people in Galilee, as in the Synoptists, and the
   educated, proud, hierarchy of Jerusalem, as in John? Or when he spoke
   on the mountain, inviting the multitude to the Messianic Kingdom at the
   opening of his ministry, and when he took farewell from his disciples
   in the chamber, in view of the great sacrifice? Socrates appears very
   different in Xenophon and in Plato, yet we can see him in both. But
   here is a far greater than Socrates. [1054]

   (2) John's mind, at a period when it was most pliable and plastic, had
   been so conformed to the mind of Christ that his own thoughts and words
   faithfully reflected the teaching of his Master. If there ever was
   spiritual sympathy and congeniality between two minds, it was between
   Jesus and the disciple whom he loved and whom he intrusted with the
   care of his mother. John stood nearer to his Lord than any Christian or
   any of the Synoptists. "Why should not John have been formed upon the
   model of Jesus rather than the Jesus of his Gospel be the reflected
   image of himself? Surely it may be left to all candid minds to say
   whether, to adopt only the lowest supposition, the creative intellect
   of Jesus was not far more likely to mould His disciple to a conformity
   with itself, than the receptive spirit of the disciple to give birth by
   its own efforts to that conception of a Redeemer which so infinitely
   surpasses the loftiest image of man's own creation." [1055]

   (3) John reproduced the discourses from the fulness of the spirit of
   Christ that dwelt in him, and therefore without any departure from the
   ideas. The whole gospel history assumes that Christ did not finish, but
   only began his work while on earth, that he carries it on in heaven
   through his chosen organs, to whom he promised mouth and wisdom (Luke
   21:15; Matt. 10:19) and his constant presence (Matt. 19:20; 28:20). The
   disciples became more and more convinced of the superhuman character of
   Christ by the irresistible logic of fact and thought. His earthly life
   appeared to them as a transient state of humiliation which was preceded
   by a pre-existent state of glory with the Father, as it was followed by
   a permanent state of glory after the resurrection and ascension to
   heaven. He withheld from them "many things" because they could not bear
   them before his glorification (John 16:12). "What I do," he said to
   Peter, "thou knowest not now, but thou shalt come to know hereafter"
   (13:7). Some of his deepest sayings, which they had at first
   misunderstood, were illuminated by the resurrection (2:22; 12:16), and
   then by the outpouring of the Spirit, who took things out of the
   fulness of Christ and declared them to the disciples (16:13, 14). Hence
   the farewell discourses are so full of the Promises of the Spirit of
   truth who would glorify Christ in their hearts. Under such guidance we
   may be perfectly sure of the substantial faithfulness of John's record.

   (4) Beneath the surface of the similarity there is a considerable
   difference between the language of Christ and the language of his
   disciple. John never attributes to Christ the designation Logos, which
   he uses so prominently in the Prologue and the first Epistle. This is
   very significant, and shows his conscientious care. He distinguished
   his own theology from the teaching of his Master, no matter whether he
   borrowed the term Logos from Philo (which cannot be proven), or coined
   it himself from his reflections on Old Testament distinctions between
   the hidden and the revealed God and Christ's own testimonies concerning
   his relation to the Father. The first Epistle of John is an echo of his
   Gospel, but with original matter of his own and Polemical references to
   the anti-Christian errors of big day. "The phrases of the Gospel," says
   Westcott, "have a definite historic connection: they belong to
   circumstances which explain them. The phrases in the Epistle are in
   part generalizations, and in part interpretations of the earlier
   language in view of Christ's completed work and of the experience of
   the Christian church."

   As to the speeches of the Baptist, in the fourth Gospel, they keep, as
   the same writer remarks, strictly within the limits suggested by the
   Old Testament. "What he says spontaneously of Christ is summed up in
   the two figures of the 'Lamb' and the 'Bridegroom,' which together give
   a comprehensive view of the suffering and joy, the redemptive and the
   completive work of Messiah under prophetic imagery. Both figures appear
   again in the Apocalypse; but it is very significant that they do not
   occur in the Lord's teaching in the fourth Gospel or in St. John's
   Epistles."

   (5) There are not wanting striking resemblances in thought and style
   between the discourses in John and in the Synoptists, especially
   Matthew, which are sufficient to refute the assertion that the two
   types of teaching are irreconcilable. [1056] The Synoptists were not
   quite unfamiliar with the other type of teaching. They occasionally
   rise to the spiritual height of John and record briefer sayings of
   Jesus which could be inserted without a discord in his Gospel. Take the
   prayer of thanksgiving and the touching invitation to all that labor
   and are heavy laden, in Matt. 11:25-30. The sublime declaration
   recorded by Luke 10:22 and Matthew 11:27: "No one knoweth the Son, save
   the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him," is thoroughly Christ-like
   according to John's conception, and is the basis of his own declaration
   in the prologue: "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten
   Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"(John
   1:18). Jesus makes no higher claim in John than he does in Matthew when
   he proclaims: "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on
   earth" (Matt. 28:18). In almost the same words Jesus says in John 17:2:
   "Thou hast given him power over all flesh."

   On the other hand, John gives us not a few specimens of those short,
   pithy maxims of oriental wisdom which characterize the Synoptic
   discourses. [1057]

   The Style of the Gospel of John.

   The style of the fourth Gospel differs widely from the ecclesiastical
   writers of the second century, and belongs to the apostolic age. It has
   none of the technical theological terms of post-apostolic
   controversies, no allusions to the state of the church, its government
   and worship, but moves in the atmosphere of the first Christian
   generation; yet differs widely from the style of the Synoptists and is
   altogether unique in the history of secular and religious literature, a
   fit expression of the genius of John: clear and deep, simple as a
   child, and mature as a saint, sad and yet serene, and basking in the
   sunshine of eternal life and love. The fourth Gospel is pure Greek in
   vocabulary and grammar, but thoroughly Hebrew in temper and spirit,
   even more so than any other book, and can be almost literally
   translated into Hebrew without losing its force or beauty. It has the
   childlike simplicity, the artlessness, the imaginativeness, the
   directness, the circumstantiality, and the rhythmical parallelism which
   characterize the writings of the Old Testament. The sentences are short
   and weighty, coordinated, not subordinated. The construction is
   exceedingly simple: no involved periods, no connecting links, no
   logical argumentation, but a succession of self-evident truths declared
   as from immediate intuition. The parallelism of Hebrew poetry is very
   apparent in such double sentences as: "Peace I leave with you; my peace
   I give unto you;" "A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one
   that is sent greater than he that sent him;" "All things were made by
   him, and without him was not anything made that hath been made."
   Examples of antithetic parallelism are also frequent: "The light
   shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not;" "He was
   in the world, and the world knew him not;" "He confessed, and denied
   not;" "I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish."

   The author has a limited vocabulary, but loves emphatic repetition, and
   his very monotony is solemn and impressive. He uses certain key-words
   of the profoundest import, as Word, life, light, truth, love, glory,
   testimony, name, sign, work, to know, to behold, to believe. These are
   not abstract conceptions but concrete realities. He views the world
   under comprehensive contrasts, as life and death, light and darkness,
   truth and falsehood, love and hatred, God and the devil, and (in the
   first Epistle) Christ and Antichrist.

   He avoids the optative, and all argumentative particles, but uses very
   frequently the simple particles kai, de, houn, hina. His most
   characteristic particle in the narrative portions is "therefore"
   (houn], oeiche is oite eim not spsllogistich [like araand its
   compounds), but indicative simply of continuation and retrospect (like
   "so" and "then" or the German "nun"), yet with the idea that nothing
   happens without a cause; while the particle "in order that" (hina)
   indicates that nothing happens without a purpose. He avoids the
   relative pronoun and prefers the connecting "and" with the repetition
   of the noun, as "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God, and the Word was God .... In him was life, and the life was the
   light of men." The "and" sometimes takes the place of "but," as "The
   light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not"
   (John 1:5).

   We look in vain for such important words as church, gospel, repentance
   (metanoia), but the substance is there in different forms. He does not
   even use the noun "faith" (pistis), which frequently occurs in the
   Synoptists and in Paul, but he uses the verb "to believe" (pisteuein)
   ninety-eight times, about twice as often as all three Synoptists
   together.

   He applies the significant term Logos (ratio and oratio) to Christ as
   the Revealer and the Interpreter of God (1:18), but only in the
   Prologue, and such figurative designations as "the Light of the world,"
   "the Bread of life," "the Good Shepherd," "the Vine," "the Way," "the
   Truth," and "the Life." He alone uses the double "Verily" in the
   discourses of the Saviour. He calls the Holy Spirit the "Paraclete" or
   "Advocate" of believers, who pleads their cause here on earth, as
   Christ pleads it on the throne in heaven. There breathes through this
   book an air of calmness and serenity, of peace and repose, that seems
   to come from the eternal mansions of heaven. [1058]

   Is such a style compatible with the hypothesis of a post- and
   pseudo-apostolic fiction? We have a large number of fictitious Gospels,
   but they differ as much from the fourth canonical Gospel as midnight
   darkness from noonday brightness.

   Authorship.

   For nearly eighteen centuries the Christian church of all denominations
   has enjoyed the fourth Gospel without a shadow of doubt that it was the
   work of John the Apostle. But in the nineteenth century the citadel was
   assailed with increasing force, and the conflict between the besiegers
   and defenders is still raging among scholars of the highest ability. It
   is a question of life and death between constructive and destructive
   criticism. The vindication of the fourth Gospel as a genuine product of
   John, the beloved disciple, is the death-blow of the mythical and
   legendary reconstruction and destruction of the life of Christ and the
   apostolic history. The ultimate result cannot be doubtful. The
   opponents have been forced gradually to retreat from the year 170 to
   the very beginning of the second century, as the time when the fourth
   Gospel was already known and used in the church, that is to the
   lifetime of many pupils and friends of John and other eye-witnesses of
   the life of Christ. [1059]

   I. The External Proof of the Johannean authorship is as strong, yea
   stronger than that of the genuineness of any classical writer of
   antiquity, and goes up to the very beginning of the second century,
   within hailing distance of the living John. It includes catholic
   writers, heretics, and heathen enemies. There is but one dissenting
   voice, hardly audible, that of the insignificant sect of the Alogi who
   opposed the Johannean doctrine of the Logos (hence their name, with the
   double meaning of unreasonable, and anti-Logos heretics) and absurdly
   ascribed both the Gospel of John and the Apocalypse to his enemy, the
   Gnostic Cerinthus. [1060] Let us briefly sum up the chief testimonies.

   1. Catholic testimonies. We begin at the fourth century and gradually
   rise up to the age of John. All the ancient Greek manuscripts of the
   New Testament, including the Sinaitic and the Vatican, which date from
   the age of Constantine and are based upon older copies of the second
   century, and all the ancient versions, including the Syriac and old
   Latin from the third and second centuries, contain without exception
   the Gospel of John, though the Peshito omits his second and third
   Epistles and the Apocalypse. These manuscripts and versions represent
   the universal voice of the churches.

   Then we have the admitted individual testimonies of all the Greek and
   Latin fathers up to the middle of the second century, without a
   dissenting voice or doubt: Jerome (d. 419) and Eusebius (d. 340), who
   had the whole ante-Nicene literature before them; Origen in Egypt (d.
   254), the greatest scholar of his age and a commentator on John;
   Tertullian of North Africa (about 200), a Catholic in doctrine, a
   Montanist in discipline, and a zealous advocate of the dispensation of
   the Paraclete announced by John; Clement of Alexandria (about 190), a
   cultivated philosopher who had travelled in Greece, Italy, Syria, and
   Palestine, seeking religious instruction everywhere; Irenaeus, a native
   of Asia Minor and from 178 bishop of Lyons, a pupil of Polycarp and a
   grand-pupil of John himself, who derived his chief ammunition against
   the Gnostic heresy from the fourth Gospel, and represents the four
   canonical Gospels--no more and no less--as universally accepted by the
   churches of his time; Theophilus of Antioch (180), who expressly quotes
   from the fourth Gospel under the name of John; [1061] the Muratorian
   Canon (170), which reports the occasion of the composition of John's
   Gospel by urgent request of his friends and disciples; Tatian of Syria
   (155-170), who in his "Address to the Greeks" repeatedly quotes the
   fourth Gospel, though without naming the author, and who began his,
   "Diatessaron"--once widely spread in the church notwithstanding the
   somewhat Gnostic leanings of the author, and commented on by Ephraem of
   Syria--with the prologue of John. [1062] From him we have but one step
   to his teacher, Justin Martyr, a native of Palestine (103-166), and a
   bold and noble-minded defender of the faith in the reigns of Hadrian
   and the Antonines. In his two Apologies and his Dialogue with Trypho
   the Jew, he often quotes freely from the four Gospels under the name of
   Apostolic "Memoirs" or "Memorabilia of the Apostles," which were read
   at his time in public, worship. [1063] He made most use of Matthew, but
   once at least he quotes a passage on regeneration [1064] from Christ's
   dialogue with Nicodemus which is recorded only by John. Several other
   allusions of Justin to John are unmistakable, and his whole doctrine of
   the pre-existent Logos who sowed precious seeds of truth among Jews and
   Gentiles before his incarnation, is unquestionably derived from John.
   To reverse the case is to derive the sunlight from the moon, or the
   fountain from one of its streams.

   But we can go still farther back. The scanty writings of the Apostolic
   Fathers, so called, have very few allusions to the New Testament, and
   breathe the atmosphere of the primitive oral tradition. The author of
   the "Didache" was well acquainted with Matthew. The first Epistle of
   Clement has strong affinity with Paul. The shorter Epistles of Ignatius
   show the influence of John's Christology. [1065] Polycarp (d. a.d. 155
   in extreme old age), a personal pupil of John, used the First Epistle
   of John, and thus furnishes an indirect testimony to the Gospel, since
   both these 'books must stand or fall together. [1066] The same is true
   of Papias (died about 150), who studied with Polycarp, and probably was
   likewise a bearer of John. He "used testimonies from the former Epistle
   of John." [1067] In enumerating the apostles whose living words he
   collected in his youth, he places John out of his regular order of
   precedence, along with Matthew, his fellow-Evangelist, and "Andrew,
   Peter, and Philip" in the same order as John 1:40-43; from which it has
   also been inferred that he knew the fourth Gospel. There is some reason
   to suppose that the disputed section on the woman taken in adultery was
   recorded by him in illustration of John 8:15; for, according to
   Eusebius, he mentioned a similar story in his lost work. [1068] These
   facts combined, make it at least extremely probable that Papias was
   familiar with John. [1069] The joint testimony of Polycarp and Papias
   represents the school of John in the very field of his later labors,
   and the succession was continued through Polycrates at Ephesus, through
   Melito at Sardis, through Claudius Apollinaris at Hieropolis, and
   Pothinus and Irenaeus in Southern Gaul. It is simply incredible that a
   spurious Gospel should have been smuggled into the churches under the
   name of their revered spiritual father and grandfather.

   Finally, the concluding verse of the appendix, John 21:24, is a still
   older testimony of a number of personal friends and pupils of John,
   perhaps the very persons who, according to ancient tradition, urged him
   to write the Gospel. The book probably closed with the sentence: "This
   is the disciple who beareth witness of these things, and wrote these
   things." To this the elders add their attestation in the plural: "And
   we know that his witness is true." A literary fiction would not have
   been benefited by an anonymous postscript. The words as they, stand are
   either a false testimony of the pseudo-John, or the true testimony of
   the friends of the real John who first received his book and published
   it before or after his death.

   The voice of the whole Catholic church, so far as it is heard, on the
   subject at all, is in favor of the authorship of John. There is not a
   shadow of proof to the contrary opinion except one, and that is purely
   negative and inconclusive. Baur to the very last laid the greatest
   stress on the entangled paschal controversy of the second century as a
   proof that John could not have written the fourth Gospel because he was
   quoted as an authority for the celebration of the Lord's Supper on the
   14th of Nisan; while the fourth Gospel, in flat contradiction to the
   Synoptists, puts the crucifixion on that day (instead of the 15th), and
   represents Christ as the true paschal lamb slain at the very time when
   the typical Jewish passover was slain. But, in the first place, some of
   the ablest scholars know how to reconcile John with the Synoptic date
   of the crucifixion on the 15th of Nisan; and, secondly, there is no
   evidence at all that the apostle John celebrated Easter with the
   Quartodecimans on the 14th of Nisan in commemoration of the day of the
   Lord's Supper. The controversy was between conforming the celebration
   of the Christian Passover to the day of the month, that is to Jewish
   chronology, or to the day of the week on which Christ died. The former
   would have made Easter, more conveniently, a fixed festival like the
   Jewish Passover, the latter or Roman practice made it a movable feast,
   and this practice triumphed at the Council of Nicaea. [1070]

   2. Heretical testimonies. They all the more important in view of their
   dissent from Catholic doctrine. It is remarkable that the heretics seem
   to have used and commented on the fourth Gospel even before the
   Catholic writers. The Clementine Homilies, besides several allusions,
   very clearly quote from the story of the man born blind, John 9:2, 3.
   [1071] The Gnostics of the second century, especially the Valentinians
   and Basilidians, made abundant use of the fourth Gospel, which
   alternately offended them by its historical realism, and attracted them
   by its idealism and mysticism. Heracleon, a pupil of Valentinus, wrote
   a commentary on it, of which Origen has preserved large extracts;
   Valentinus himself (according to Tertullian) tried either to explain it
   away, or he put his own meaning into it. Basilides, who flourished
   about a.d. 125, quoted from the Gospel of John such passages as the
   "true light, which enlighteneth every man was coming into the world"
   (John 1:9), and, my hour is not yet come "(2:4). [1072]

   These heretical testimonies are almost decisive by themselves. The
   Gnostics would rather have rejected the fourth Gospel altogether, as
   Marcion actually did, from doctrinal objection. They certainly would
   not have received it from the Catholic church, as little as the church
   would have received it from the Gnostics. The concurrent reception of
   the Gospel by both at so early a date is conclusive evidence of its
   genuineness. "The Gnostics of that date," says Dr. Abbot, [1073]
   "received it because they could not help it. They would not have
   admitted the authority of a book which could be reconciled with their
   doctrines only by the most forced interpretation, if they could have
   destroyed its authority by denying its genuineness. Its genuineness
   could then be easily ascertained. Ephesus was one of the principal
   cities of the Eastern world, the centre of extensive commerce, the
   metropolis of Asia Minor. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people were
   living who had known the apostle John. The question whether he, the
   beloved disciple, had committed to writing his recollections of his
   Master's life and teaching, was one of the greatest interest. The fact
   of the reception of the fourth Gospel as his work at so early a date,
   by parties so violently opposed to each other, proves that the evidence
   of its genuineness was decisive. This argument is further confirmed by
   the use of the Gospel by the opposing parties in the later Montanistic
   controversy, and in the disputes about the time of celebrating Easter."

   3. Heathen testimony. Celsus, in his book against Christianity, which
   was written about a.d. 178 (according to Keim, who reconstructed it
   from the fragments preserved in the refutation of Origen), derives his
   matter for attack from the four Gospels, though he does not name their
   authors, and he refers to several details which are peculiar to John,
   as, among others, the blood which flowed from the body of Jesus at his
   crucifixion (John 19:34), and the fact that Christ "after his death
   arose and showed the marks of his punishment, and how his hands had
   been pierced" (20:25, 27). [1074]

   The radical assertion of Baur that no distinct trace of the fourth
   Gospel can be found before the last quarter of the second century has
   utterly broken down, and his own best pupils have been forced to make
   one concession after another as the successive discoveries of the many
   Gnostic quotations in the Philosophumena, the last book of the
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies, the Syrian Commentary on Tatian's
   Diatessaron, revealed the stubborn fact of the use and abuse of the
   Gospel before the middle and up to the very beginning of the second
   century, that is, to a time when it was simply impossible to mistake a
   pseudo-apostolic fiction for a genuine production of the patriarch of
   the apostolic age.

   II. Internal Evidence. This is even still stronger, and leaves at last
   no alternative but truth or fraud.

   1. To begin with the style of the fourth Gospel, we have already seen
   that it is altogether unique and without a parallel in post-apostolic
   literature, betraying a Hebrew of the Hebrews, impregnated with the
   genius of the Old Testament, in mode of thought and expression, in
   imagery and symbolism, in the symmetrical structure of sentences, in
   the simplicity and circumstantiality of narration; yet familiar with
   pure Greek, from long residence among Greeks. This is just what we
   should expect from John at Ephesus. Though not a rabbinical scholar,
   like Paul, he was acquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures and not
   dependent on the Septuagint. He has in all fourteen quotations from the
   Old Testament. [1075] Four of these agree with the Hebrew and the
   Septuagint; three agree with the Hebrew against the Septuagint (6:45;
   13:18 19:37), the rest are neutral, either agreeing with both or
   differing from both, or being free adaptations rather than citations;
   but none of them agrees with the Septuagint against the Hebrew. [1076]

   Among the post-apostolic writers there is no converted Jew, unless it
   be Hegesippus; none who could read the Hebrew and write Hebraistic
   Greek. After the destruction of Jerusalem the church finally separated
   from the synagogue and both assumed an attitude of uncompromising
   hostility.

   2. The author was a Jew of Palestine. He gives, incidentally and
   without effort, unmistakable evidence of minute familiarity with the
   Holy Land and its inhabitants before the destruction of Jerusalem. He
   is at home in the localities of the holy city and the neighborhood. He
   describes Bethesda as "a pool by the sheep gate, having five porches"
   (5:2), Siloam as "a pool which is by interpretation Sent" (9:7),
   Solomon's porch as being "in the Temple" (10:23), the brook Kedron
   "where was a garden" (18:1); he knows the location of the praetorium
   (18:28), the meaning of Gabbatha (19:13), and Golgotha (19:17), the
   distance of Bethany from Jerusalem "about fifteen furlongs off"
   (11:18), and he distinguishes it from Bethany beyond Jordan (1:28). He
   gives the date when the Herodian reconstruction of the temple began
   (2:19). He is equally familiar with other parts of Palestine and makes
   no mistakes such as are so often made by foreigners. He locates Cana in
   Galilee (2:1; 4:26 21:2), to distinguish it from another Cana; Aenon
   "near to Salim" where there are "many waters" (3:23); Sychar in Samaria
   near "Jacob's, well," and in view of Mount Gerizim (4:5). He knows the
   extent of the Lake of Tiberias (6:19); he describes Bethsaida as "the
   city of Andrew and Peter" (1:44), as distinct from Bethsaida Julias on
   the eastern bank of the Jordan; he represents Nazareth as a place of
   proverbial insignificance (1:46).

   He is well acquainted with the confused politico-ecclesiastical
   Messianic ideas and expectations of the Jews (1:19-28, 45-49; 4:25;
   6:14, 15 7:26; 12:34, and other passages); with the hostility between
   Jews and Samaritans (4:9, 20, 22 8:48); with Jewish usages and
   observances, as baptism (1:25; 3:22, 23 4:2), purification (2:6; 3:25,
   etc.), ceremonial pollution (18:28), feasts (2:13, 23; 5:1 7:37, etc.),
   circumcision, and the Sabbath (7:22, 23). He is also acquainted with
   the marriage and burial rites (2:1-10; 11:17-44), with the character of
   the Pharisees and their influence in the Sanhedrin, the relationship
   between Annas and Caiaphas. The objection of Bretschneider that he
   represents the office of the high-priest as an annual office arose from
   a misunderstanding of the phrase "that year" (11:49, 51 18:13), by
   which he means that memorable year in which Christ died for the sins of
   the people.

   3. The author was an eye-witness of most of the events narrated. This
   appears from his life-like familiarity with the acting persons, the
   Baptist, Peter, Andrew, Philip, Nathanael, Thomas, Judas Iscariot,
   Pilate, Caiaphas, Annas, Nicodemus, Martha and Mary, Mary Magdalene,
   the woman of Samaria, the man born blind; and from the minute traits
   and vivid details which betray autopticity. He incidentally notices
   what the Synoptists omit, that the traitor was "the son of Simon" (
   6:71; 12:4; 13:2, 26 at Thomas was called "Didymus" (11:16; 20:24
   21:2); while, on the other hand, he calls the Baptist simply "John" (
   he himself being the other John), without adding to it the distinctive
   title as the Synoptists do more than a dozen times to distinguish him
   from the son of Zebedee. [1077] He indicates the days and hours of
   certain events, [1078] and the exact or approximate number of persons
   and objects mentioned. [1079] He was privy to the thoughts of the
   disciples on certain occasions, their ignorance and misunderstanding of
   the words of the Master, [1080] and even to the motives and feelings of
   the Lord. [1081]

   No literary artist could have invented the conversation of Christ with
   Nicodemus on the mystery of spiritual regeneration (John 3), or the
   conversation with the woman of Samaria (John 4), or the characteristic
   details of the catechization of the man born blind, which brings out so
   naturally the proud and heartless bigotry of the Jewish hierarchy and
   the rough, outspoken honesty and common sense of the blind man and his
   parents (9:13-34). The scene at Jacob's well, described in John 4,
   presents a most graphic, and yet unartificial picture of nature and
   human life as it still remains, though in decay, at the foot of Gerizim
   and Ebal: there is the well of Jacob in a fertile, well-watered valley,
   there the Samaritan sanctuary on the top of Mount Gerizim, there the
   waving grain-fields ripening for the harvest; we are confronted with
   the historic antagonism of Jews and Samaritans which survives in the
   Nablus of to-day; there we see the genuine humanity of Jesus, as he sat
   down "wearied with his journey," though not weary of his work, his
   elevation above the rabbinical prejudice of conversing with a woman,
   his superhuman knowledge and dignity; there is the curiosity and
   quick-wittedness of the Samaritan Magdalene; and how natural is the
   transition from the water of Jacob's well to the water of life, and
   from the hot dispute of the place of worship to the highest conception
   of God as an omnipresent spirit, and his true worship in spirit and in
   truth. [1082]

   4. The writer represents himself expressly as an eye-witness of the
   life of Christ. He differs from the Synoptists, who never use the first
   person nor mix their subjective feelings with the narrative. "We beheld
   his glory," he says, in the name of all the apostles and primitive
   disciples, in stating the general impression made upon them by the
   incarnate Logos dwelling. [1083] And in the parallel passage of the
   first Epistle, which is an inseparable companion of the fourth Gospel,
   he asserts with solemn emphasis his personal knowledge of the incarnate
   Word of life whom he heard with his ears and saw with his eyes and
   handled with his hands (1 John 1:1-3). This assertion is general, and
   covers the whole public life of our Lord. But he makes it also in
   particular a case of special interest for the realness of Christ's
   humanity; in recording the flow of blood and water from the wounded
   side, he adds emphatically: "He that hath seen hath borne witness, and
   his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith things that are true,
   that ye also may believe" (John 19:35). Here we are driven to the
   alternative: either the writer was a true witness of what he relates,
   or he was a false witness who wrote down a deliberate lie.

   5. Finally, the writer intimates that he is one of the Twelve, that he
   is one of the favorite three, that he is not Peter, nor James, that he
   is none other than the beloved John who leaned on the Master's bosom.
   He never names himself, nor his brother James, nor his mother Salome,
   but he has a very modest, delicate, and altogether unique way of
   indirect self-designation. He stands behind his Gospel like a
   mysterious figure with a thin veil over his face without ever lifting
   the veil. He leaves the reader to infer the name by combination. He is
   undoubtedly that unnamed disciple who, with Andrew, was led to Jesus by
   the testimony of the Baptist on the banks of the Jordan (1:35-40), the
   disciple who at the last Supper "was reclining at the table in Jesus'
   bosom" (13:23-25), that "other disciple" who, with Peter, followed
   Jesus into the court of the high-priest (18:15, 16), who stood by the
   cross and was intrusted by the dying Lord with the care of His mother
   (19:26, 27), and that "other disciple whom Jesus loved," who went with
   Peter to the empty sepulchre on the resurrection morning and was
   convinced of the great fact by the sight of the grave-cloths, and the
   head-cover rolled up in a place by itself (20:2-8). All these
   narratives are interwoven with autobiographic details. He calls himself
   "the disciple whom Jesus loved," not from vanity (as has been most
   strangely asserted by some critics), but in blessed and thankful
   remembrance of the infinite mercy of his divine Master who thus
   fulfilled the prophecy of his name Johanan, i.e., Jehovah is gracious.
   In that peculiar love of his all-beloved Lord was summed up for him the
   whole significance of his life.

   With this mode of self-designation corresponds the designation of
   members of his family: his mother is probably meant by the unnamed
   "sister of the mother" of Jesus, who stood by the cross (John 19:25),
   for Salome was there, according to the Synoptists, and John would
   hardly omit this fact; and in the list of the disciples to whom Jesus
   appeared at the Lake of Galilee, "the sons of Zebedee" are put last
   (21:2), when yet in all the Synoptic lists of the apostles they are,
   with Peter and Andrew, placed at the head of the Twelve. This
   difference can only be explained from motives of delicacy and modesty.

   What a contrast the author presents to those pseudonymous literary
   forgers of the second and third centuries, who unscrupulously put their
   writings into the mouth of the apostles or other honored names to lend
   them a fictitious charm and authority; and yet who cannot conceal the
   fraud which leaks out on every page.

   Conclusion.

   A review of this array of testimonies, external and internal, drives us
   to the irresistible conclusion that the fourth Gospel is the work of
   John, the apostle. This view is clear, self-consistent, and in full
   harmony with the character of the book and the whole history of the
   apostolic age; while the hypothesis of a literary fiction and pious
   fraud is contradictory, absurd, and self-condemned. No writer in the
   second century could have produced such a marvellous book, which towers
   high above all the books of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus and Tertullian
   and Clement and Origen, or any other father or schoolman or reformer.
   No writer in the first century could have written it but an apostle,
   and no apostle but John, and John himself could not have written it
   without divine inspiration.

   friends, or distinguished, notable men], pneumati theophorethenta,

   John alone among the Evangelists clearly teaches the divinity of
   Christ. Tom. 1:6 in Joan. (Opp., IV. 6).

   [1047] H. E., III. 24. Jerome repeats this view and connects it with
   the antiheretical aim, De vir. illustr., c. 9, comp. Com. in Matt.
   Proaem. Theodore of Mopsuestia thought that John intended to supplement
   the Synoptists chiefly by the discourses on the divinity of Christ. See
   Fritzsche's ed. of fragments of his Commentaries on the New Test.,
   Turici, p. 19 sq. (quoted by Hilgenfeld, Einleitung, p. 696).

   [1048] Godet expresses the same view (I. 862): "Cette intention de
   compléter les récits antérieurs, soit au point de vue historique, comme
   l'a pensé Eusébe, soit sous un rapport plus spirituel, comme l'a
   déclaré Clément d'Alexandrie, est donc parfaitement fondée en fait;

   moyen servant au but principal."

   [1050] DeWette says that the discourses of Christ in John shine with
   more than earthly brilliancy (sie strahlen in mehr als irdischem
   Brillantfeuer, Exeg. Handbuch, I.3, p. 7). Holtzmann: "The fundamental
   ideas of the fourth Gospel lie far beyond the horizon of the church in
   the second century, and indeed of the whole Christian church down to
   the present day" (in Schenkel's "Bibel. Lexik.," II. 234). Baur and
   Keim (I. 133) give the Gospel the highest praise asa philosophy of
   religion, but deny its historical value.

   [1051] Renan and John Stuart Mill have confessed a strong antipathy to
   these discourses. Renan's last judgment on the Gospel of John (in
   L'église chrét., 1879, p. 51) is as follows: "On l'a trop admiré. Il a
   de la chaleur, parfois une sorte de sublimité, mais quelque chose
   d'enflé, de faux, d'obsur. La naïveté manque tout à fait. L'auteur ne
   raconte pas; il démontre. Rien de plus tatigant que ses longs récits de
   miracles et que ces discussions, roulant sur des malentendus, où les
   adversaires de Jésus jouent le rôle d'idiots. Combien à ce pathos
   verbeux nous préférons le doux style, tout hébreu encore, du Discours
   sur la montagne, et cette limpidité de narration qui fait le charme des
   évangélistes primitifs! Ceux-ci n'ont pas besoin de répéter sans cesse
   que ce qu'ils racontent est vrai. Leur sincérité, inconsciente de
   l'objection, n'a pas cette soif fébrile d'attestations répétéesqui
   montre que l'incrédulité, le doute, ont déjà commencé. Au ton
   légèrement excité de ce nouveau narrateur, on dirait qu'il a peur de
   n'étre pas cru, et qu'il cherche à surprendre la religion de son
   lecteur par des affirmations pleines d'emphase." John Stuart Mill
   (Three Essays on Religion, p. 253) irreverently calls the discourses in
   John "poor stuff," imported from Philo and the Alexandrian Platonists,
   and imagines that a multitude of Oriental Gnostics might have
   manufactured such a book. But why did they not do it?

   [1052] Notwithstanding such passages Dr. Davidson asserts (II. 278):
   "In uniting the only-begotten Son of God with the historical Jesus, the
   evangelist implies the absence of full humanity. The personality
   consists essentially of the Logos, the flesh being only a temporary
   thing. Body, soul, and spirit do not belong to Jesus Christ; he is the
   Logos incarnate for a time, who soon returns to the original state of
   oneness with the Father."

   [1053] Lange, Westcott, Milligan and Moulton dwell at length on this
   feature.

   [1054] Hase (Geschichte Jesu, p. 61) makes some striking remarks on
   this parallel: "Der Sokrates des Xenophon ist ein anderer als der des
   Plato, jeder hat diejenige Seite aufgefasst, die ihm die nächst und
   liebste war; erst aus beider. Darstellungen erkennen wir den rechten
   Sokrates. Xenophons anschauliche Einfachheit trägt das volle Gepräge
   der Wahrheit dessen, was er erzählt. Dennoch dieser Sokrates, der sich
   im engen Kreise sittlicher und politischer Vorstellungen herumdreht,
   ist nicht der ganze Sokrates, der weiseste in Griechenland, der die
   grosse Revolution in den Geistem seines Volks hervorgerufen hat.
   Dagegen der platonische Sokrates sich weit mehr zum Schöpfer der neuen
   Periods griechischer Philosophie eignet und darnach aussieht, als habe
   er die Weisheit vom Himmel zur Erde gebracht, der attische Logos."

   Introd., p. xxxiii.

   pu parler comme le veut Jean."

   lxxxii sq. The following are the principal parallel passages:
   John 2:19: Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
   in three days I will raise it up. Matt. 26:61: This man said, I am able
   to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. Cf. Mark
   14:58; 15:29.
   3:18: He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not
   hath been judged already. Mark 16:16: He that believeth and is baptized
   shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.
   4:44: For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his
   own country. Matt. 15:57: But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not
   without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house. Cf. Mark
   6:4; Luke 4:24
   5:8: Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. Matt. 9:6:
   Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thy house. Cf. Mark 2:9; Luke
   5:24.
   6:20: It is I, be not afraid. Matt 14:27: It is I, be not afraid. Cf.
   Mark 6:50.
   6:35: He that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on
   me shall never thirst. Matt. 5:6; Luke 6:21: Blessed are they that
   hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
   6:37: All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him
   that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out. Matt. 11:28, 29: Come
   unto me, an ye that labor and are heavy laden, ... and ye shall find
   rest unto your souls.
   6:46: Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is from God,
   he hath seen the Father. Cf. 1:18: No man hath seen God at any time;
   the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
   declared him. Matt. 11:27: And no one knoweth the Son, save the Father,
   neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever
   the Son willeth to reveal him.
   12:8: For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
   Matt. 26:11: For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
   always. Cf. Mark 14:7.
   12:25: He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life
   in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. Matt. 10: 39: He that
   findeth his life shall lose it; and he thatloseth his life for my sake
   shall find it. Cf. 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:83.
   12:27: Now is my soul troubled; and what shall say? Father, save me
   from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. Matt. 26:38:
   Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
   death. Cf. Mark 14:84.
   13:3: Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands
   .... Matt. 11:27: All things have been delivered unto me of my Father.
   13:16: Verily, verily I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his
   lord. Matt. 10:24: A disciple is not above his master, nor a servant
   above his lord. Cf. Luke 6:40.
   13:20: He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that
   receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. Matt. 10:40: He that receiveth
   you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
   14:18: I will not leave you desolate; I come unto you. Cf. 14:23: We
   will ... make our abode with him. Matt. 28:20: I am with you alway,
   even unto the end of the world.
   15:21: But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake.
   Matt. 10:22: And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's make.
   17:2: Even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh. Matt. 28:18:
   All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.
   20:23: Whosover sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them. Matt.
   18:18: What things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
   heaven.

   Study of the Greek Test., pp. 66-75, where the opinions of Renan,
   Ewald, Luthardt, Keim, Godet, Westcott, Hase, and Weiss are given on
   the subject.

   of the genuineness of John there mentioned must now be added the
   masterly discussion of Dr. Weiss in his Leben Jesu (vol. I., 1882, pp.
   84-124), which has just come to hand.

   [1060] Recently renewed in part by Renan (1879). See below.

   [1061] His quotation is considered the earliest by name; but Irenaeus,
   who wrote between 177 and 192, represents an older tradition, and
   proves to his satisfaction that there must be just four Gospels to
   answer the four cherubim in Ezekiel's vision. Adv. Haer., III. 1, 1;
   11, 8; V. 36, 2.

   [1062] The Commentary of Ephraem Syrus on the Diatessaron (375) has
   recently been discovered and published from an Armenian translation, at
   Venice, in 1876. Comp. Zahn, Tatian's Diatessaron, Erlangen, 1881, and
   Harnack, Die Ueberlieferung der griechisch en Apologeten des zweiten
   Jahrh., Leipzig, 1882, pp. 213 sqq.

   [1063] The use of the Gospel of John by Justin Martyr was doubted by
   Baur and most of his followers, but is admitted by Hilgenfeld and Keim.
   It was again denied by the anonymous author of "Supernatural Religion,"
   and by Edwin A. Abbott (in the art. Gospels, "Enc. Brit.," vol. X 821),
   and again conclusively proven by Sanday in England, and Ezra Abbot in
   America.

   [1064] The quotation is not literal but from memory, like most of his
   quotations: Justin, Apol., I. 61: "For Christ also said, Except ye
   beborn again [anagennethete, comp. 1 Pet. 3:23], ye shall in no wise
   enter [eiselthete, but comp. the same word In John 8:5 and 7] into the
   kingdom of heaven (the phrase of Matthew]. Now that it is impossible
   for those who have once been born to re-enter the wombs of those that
   bare them is manifest to all." John 3:3, 4: "Jesus answered and said to
   him [Nicodemus], Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
   anew [or from above, gennethe anothen], he cannot see [idein 3: 5,
   enter into] the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man
   be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's
   womb and be born?" Much account has been made by the Tübingen critics
   of the slight differences in the quotation (anagennethete for gennethe
   anothen, eiselthein for idein and basileia ton ouranon for bas. tou
   theou) to disprove the connection, or, as this is impossible, to prove
   the dependence of John on Justin! But Dr. Abbot, a most accurate and
   conscientious scholar, who moreover as a Unitarian cannot be charged
   with an orthodox bias, has produced many parallel cases of free
   quotations of the same passage not only from patristic writers, but
   even from modem divines, including no less than nine quotations of the
   passage by Jeremy Taylor, only two of which are alike. I think he has
   conclusively proven his case for every reasonable mind. See his
   invaluable monograph on The Authorship of the Fourth Gospel, pp. 28
   sqq. and 91 sqq. Comp. also Weiss, Leben Jesu, I. 83, who sees in
   Justin Martyr not only "an unquestionable allusion to the Nicodemus
   story of the fourth Gospel," but other isolated reminiscences

   [1065] Comp. such expressions as "I desire bread of God, which is the
   flesh of Jesus Christ ... and I desire as drink His blood, which is
   love imperishable," Ad Rom., ch. 7, with John 6:47 sqq.; "living
   water," Ad Rom. 7, with John 4:10, 11; "being Himself the Door of the
   Father," Ad Philad., 9, with John 10:9; [the Spirit] "knows whence it
   cometh and whither it goeth," Ad Philad., 7, with John 3:8. I quoted
   from the text of Zahn. See the able art. of Lightfoot in "Contemp.
   Rev." for February, 1875, and his S. Ignatius, 1885.

   [1066] Polyc., Ad Phil., ch. 7: "Every one that doth not confess that
   Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh is Antichrist; and whosoever doth
   not confess the mystery of the cross is of the devil." Comp. 1 John
   4:3. On the testimony of Polycarp see Lightfoot in the "Contemp. Rev."
   for May, 1875. Westcott, p. xxx, says: "A testimony to one" (the Gospel
   or the first Ep.) "is necessarily by inference a testimony to the
   other."

   [1067] According to Eusebius, III. 39. See Lightfoot in the "Contemp.
   Rev." for August and October, 1875.

   [1068] Eusebius, H. E., III. 39, closes his account of Papias with the
   notice: "He has likewise set forth another narrative [in his Exposition
   of the Lord's Oracles] concerning a woman who was maliciously accused
   before the Lord touching many sins, which is contained in the Gospel
   according to the Hebrews."

   [1069] In a tradition too late (ninth century) to be of any critical
   weight, Papias is even made the amanuensis of John in the preparation
   of his Gospel. A Vatican Codex (of Queen Christina of Sweden) has this
   marginal gloss: "Evangelium Johannis manifestatum et datum est
   ecclesiis ab Johanne adhuc in corpore constituto; sicut Papiss, nomine
   Hieropolitanus discipulus Johannis carus, in exotericis [exegeticis],id
   est in extremis, quinque libris retulit [referring no doubt to the five
   books of Logion Kuriakon exegeseis] Descripsit vero evangelium dictante
   Johanne recte." This was hailed as a direct testimony of Papias for
   John by Prof. Aberle (Rom. Cath.) in the " Tübing. Quartalschrift,"
   1864, No. 1, but set aside by Hilgenfeld versus Aberle, in his "
   Zeitschrift," 1865, pp. 77 sqq., and Hase, l.c, p. 35. If Eusebius had
   found this notice in the work of Papias, he would have probably
   mentioned it in connection with his testimonies on the Gospels of
   Matthew and Mark. But see Westcott, Canon, 5th ed., p. 77, note 1.

   authorship of the fourth Gospel was unfortunately shaken in his
   conflict with the Tübingen giant, but he declares the objections of
   Baur after all inconclusive, and seeks an escape from the dilemma by
   the untenable compromise that the oral teaching of John a few years

   pilgrims on the very spot where the Saviour rested, with the
   irresistible impression that every word is true and adapted to the time

   in ruins and no more used, but the living spring of water which the
   Saviour first opened there to a poor, sinful, yet penitent woman is as
   deep and fresh as ever, and will quench the thirst of souls to the end
   of time." So I wrote in 1871 for the English edition of Lange's Com. on
   John, p. 151. Six years afterward I fully realized my anticipations,
   when with a company of friends I sat down on Jacob's well and read John
   4 as I never read it before. Palestine, even in "the imploring beauty
   of decay," is indeed a "fifth Gospel" which sheds more light on the
   four than many a commentary brimful of learning and critical
   conjectures.

   [1083] John 1:14: etheasametha ten doxan. theaomai is richer than

   1:16.

   § 84. Critical Review of the Johannean Problem.

   See the Liter. in § 40, pp. 408 sqq., and the history of the
   controversy by Holtzmann, in Bunsen's Bibelwerk, VIII. 56 sqq.; Reuss,
   Gesch. der heil. Schriften N. T.'s (6th ed.), I. 248 sqq.; Godet, Com.
   (3d ed.), I. 32 sqq.; Holtzmann, Einleitung (2d ed.), 423 sqq.; Weiss,
   Einleitung (1886), 609 sqq.

   The importance of the subject justifies a special Section on the
   opposition to the fourth Gospel, after we have presented our own view
   on the subject with constant reference to the recent objections.

   The Problem Stated.

   The Johannean problem is the burning question of modern criticism on
   the soil of the New Testament. It arises from the difference between
   John and the Synoptists on the one hand, and the difference between the
   fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse on the other.

   I. The Synoptic aspect of the problem includes the differences between
   the first three Evangelists and the fourth concerning the theatre and
   length of Christ's ministry, the picture of Christ, the nature and
   extent of his discourses, and a number of minor details. It admits the
   following possibilities:

   (1.) Both the Synoptists and John are historical, and represent only
   different aspects of the same person and work of Christ, supplementing
   and confirming each other in every essential point. This is the faith
   of the Church and the conviction of nearly all conservative critics and
   commentators.

   (2.) The fourth Gospel is the work of John, and, owing to his intimacy
   with Christ, it is more accurate and reliable than the Synoptists, who
   contain some legendary embellishments and even errors, derived from
   oral tradition, and must be rectified by John. This is the view of
   Schleiermacher, Lücke, Bleek, Ewald, Meyer, Weiss, and a considerable
   number of liberal critics and exegetes who yet accept the substance of
   the whole gospel history as true, and Christ as the Lord and Saviour of
   the race. The difference between these scholars and the church
   tradition is not fundamental, and admits of adjustment.

   (3.) The Synoptists represent (in the main) the Christ of history, the
   fourth Gospel the ideal Christ of faith and fiction. So Baur and the
   Tübingen school (Schwegler, Zeller, Köstlin, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar,
   Holtzmann, , Hausrath, Schenkel, Mangold, Keim, Thoma), with their
   followers and sympathizers in France (Nicolas, d'Eichthal, Renan,
   Réville, Sabatier), Holland (Scholten and the Leyden school), and
   England (the anonymous author of "Supernatural Religion," Sam.
   Davidson, Edwin A. Abbott). But these critics eliminate the miraculous
   even from the Synoptic Christ, at least as far as possible, and
   approach the fourth hypothesis.

   (4.) The Synoptic and Johannean Gospels are alike fictitious, and
   resolve themselves into myths and legends or pious frauds. This is the
   position of the extreme left wing of modern criticism represented
   chiefly by Strauss. It is the legitimate result of the denial of the
   supernatural and miraculous, which is as inseparable from the Synoptic
   as it is from the Johannean Christ; but it is also subversive of all
   history and cannot be seriously maintained in the face of overwhelming
   facts and results. Hence there has been a considerable reaction among
   the radical critics in favor of a more historical position. Keim's,
   "History of Jesus of Nazara" is a very great advance upon Strauss's
   "Leben Jesu," though equally critical and more learned, and meets the
   orthodox view half way on the ground of the Synoptic tradition, as
   represented in the Gospel of Matthew, which he dates back to a.d. 66.

   II. The Apocalyptic aspect of the Johannean problem belongs properly to
   the consideration of the Apocalypse, but it has of late been
   inseparably interwoven with the Gospel question. It admits likewise of
   four distinct views:

   (1.) The fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse are both from the pen of the
   apostle John, but separated by the nature of the subject, the condition
   of the writer, and an interval of at least twenty or thirty years, to
   account for the striking differences of temper and style. When he met
   Paul at Jerusalem, a.d. 50, he was one of the three "pillar-apostles"
   of Jewish Christianity (Gal. 2:9), but probably less than forty years
   of age, remarkably silent with his reserved force, and sufficiently in
   sympathy with Paul to give him the right hand of fellowship; when he
   wrote the Apocalypse, between a.d. 68 and 70, he was not yet sixty, and
   when he wrote the Gospel he was over eighty years of age. Moreover, the
   differences between the two books are more than counterbalanced by an
   underlying harmony. This has been acknowledged even by the head of the
   Tübingen critics, who calls the fourth Gospel an Apocalypse
   spiritualized or a transfiguration of the Apocalypse. [1084]

   (2.) John wrote the Gospel, but not the Apocalypse. Many critics of the
   moderate school are disposed to surrender the Apocalypse and to assign
   it to the somewhat doubtful and mysterious "Presbyter John," a
   contemporary of the Apostle John. So Schleiermacher, Lücke, Bleek,
   Neander, Ewald, Düsterdieck, etc. If we are to choose between the two
   books, the Gospel has no doubt stronger claims upon our acceptance.

   (3.) John wrote the Apocalypse, but for this very reason he cannot have
   written the fourth Gospel. So Baur, Renan, Davidson, Abbott, and nearly
   all the radical critics (except Keim).

   (4.) The fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse are both spurious and the
   work of the Gnostic Cerinthus (as the Alogi held), or of some anonymous
   forger. This view is so preposterous and unsound that no critic of any
   reputation for learning and judgment dares to defend it.

   There is a correspondence between the four possible attitudes on both
   aspects of the Johannean question, and the parties advocating them.

   The result of the conflict will be the substantial triumph of the faith
   of the church which accepts, on new grounds of evidence, all the four
   Gospels as genuine and historical, and the Apocalypse and the fourth
   Gospel as the works of John.

   The Assaults on the Fourth Gospel.

   Criticism has completely shifted its attitude on both parts of the
   problem. The change is very remarkable. When the first serious assault
   was made upon the genuineness of the fourth Gospel by the learned
   General Superintendent Bretschneider (in 1820), he was met with such
   overwhelming opposition, not only from evangelical divines like
   Olshausen and Tholuck, but also from Schleiermacher, Lücke, Credner,
   and Schott, that he honestly confessed his defeat a few years afterward
   (1824 and 1828). [1085] And when Dr. Strauss, in his Leben Jesu (1835),
   renewed the denial, a host of old and new defenders arose with such
   powerful arguments that he himself (as he confessed in the third
   edition of 1838) was shaken in his doubt, especially by the weight and
   candor of Neander, although he felt compelled, in self-defence, to
   reaffirm his doubt as essential to the mythical hypothesis (in the
   fourth edition, 1840, and afterward in his popular Leben Jesu, 1864).

   But in the meantime his teacher, Dr. Baur, the coryphaeus of the
   Tübingen school, was preparing his heavy ammunition, and led the
   second, the boldest, the most vigorous and effective assault upon the
   Johannean fort (since 1844). [1086] He was followed in the main
   question, though with considerable modifications in detail, by a number
   of able and acute critics in Germany and other countries. He
   represented the fourth Gospel as a purely ideal work which grew out of
   the Gnostic, Montanistic, and paschal controversies after the middle of
   the second century, and adjusted the various elements of the Catholic
   faith with consummate skill and art. It was not intended to be a
   history, but a system of theology in the garb of history. This
   "tendency" hypothesis was virtually a death-blow to the mythical theory
   of Strauss, which excludes conscious design.

   The third great assault inspired by Baur, yet with independent learning
   and judgment, was made by Dr. Keim (in his Geschichte Jesu von Nazara,
   1867). He went beyond Baur in one point: he denied the whole tradition
   of John's sojourn in Ephesus as a mistake of Irenaeus; he thus removed
   even the foundation for the defence of the Apocalypse as a Johannean
   production, and neutralized the force of the Tübingen assault derived
   from that book. On the other hand, he approached the traditional view
   by tracing the composition back from 170 (Baur) to the reign of Trajan,
   i.e., to within a few years after the death of the apostle. In his
   denial of the Ephesus tradition he met with little favor, [1087] but
   strong opposition from the Tübingen critics, who see the fatal bearing
   of this denial upon the genuineness of the Apocalypse. [1088] The
   effect of Keim's movement therefore tended rather to divide and
   demoralize the besieging force.

   Nevertheless the effect of these persistent attacks was so great that
   three eminent scholars, Hase of Jena (1876), Reuss of Strassburg, and
   Sabatier of Paris (1879), deserted from the camp of the defenders to
   the army of the besiegers. Renan, too, who had in the thirteenth
   edition of his Vie de Jesus (1867) defended the fourth Gospel at least
   in part, has now (since 1879, in his L'Église chrétienne) given it up
   entirely. [1089]

   The Defence of the Fourth Gospel.

   The incisive criticism of Baur and his school compelled a thorough
   reinvestigation of the whole problem, and in this way has been of very
   great service to the cause of truth. We owe to it the ablest defences
   of the Johannean authorship of the fourth Gospel and the precious
   history which it represents. Prominent among these defenders against
   the latest attacks were Bleek, Lange, Ebrard, Thiersch, Schneider,
   Tischendorf, Riggenbach, Ewald, Steitz, Aberle, Meyer, Luthardt,
   Wieseler, Beyschlag, Weiss, among the Germans; Godet, Pressensé, Astié,
   among the French; Niermeyer, Van Oosterzee, Hofstede de Groot, among
   the Dutch; Alford, Milligan, Lightfoot, Westcott, Sanday, Plummer,
   among the English; Fisher, and Abbot among the Americans. [1090]

   It is significant that the school of negative criticism has produced no
   learned commentary on John. All the recent commentators on the fourth
   Gospel (Lücke, Ewald, Lange, Hengstenberg, Luthardt, Meyer, Weiss,
   Alford, Wordsworth, Godet, Westcott, Milligan , Moulton, Plummer, etc.)
   favor its genuineness.

   The Difficulties of the Anti-Johannean Theory.

   The prevailing theory of the negative critics is this: They accept the
   Synoptic Gospels, with the exception of the miracles, as genuine
   history, but for this very reason they reject John; and they accept the
   Apocalypse as the genuine work of the apostle John, who is represented
   by the Synoptists as a Son of Thunder, and by Paul (Gal. 2) as one of
   the three pillars of conservative Jewish Christianity, but for this
   very reason they deny that he can have written the Gospel, which in
   style and spirit differs so widely from the Apocalypse. For this
   position they appeal to the fact that the Synoptists and the Apocalypse
   are equally well, and even better supported by internal and external
   evidence, and represent a tradition which is at least twenty years
   older.

   But what then becomes of the fourth Gospel? It is incredible that the
   real John should have falsified the history of his Master; consequently
   the Gospel which bears his name is a post-apostolic fiction, a
   religious poem, or a romance on the theme of the incarnate Logos. It is
   the Gospel of Christian Gnosticism, strongly influenced by the
   Alexandrian philosophy of Philo. Yet it is no fraud any more than other
   literary fictions. The unknown author dealt with the historical Jesus
   of the Synoptists, as Plato dealt with Socrates, making him simply the
   base for his own sublime speculations, and putting speeches into his
   mouth which he never uttered.

   Who was that Christian Plato? No critic can tell, or even conjecture,
   except Renan, who revived, as possible at least, the absurd view of the
   Alogi, that the Gnostic heretic, Cerinthus the enemy of John, wrote the
   fourth Gospel [1091] Such a conjecture requires an extraordinary
   stretch of imagination and an amazing amount of credulity. The more
   sober among the critics suppose that the author was a highly gifted
   Ephesian disciple of John, who freely reproduced and modified his oral
   teaching after he was removed by death. But how could his name be
   utterly unknown, when the names of Polycarp and Papias and other
   disciples of John, far less important, have come down to as? "The great
   unknown" is a mystery indeed. Some critics, half in sympathy with
   Tübingen, are willing to admit that John himself wrote a part of the
   book, either the historic narratives or the discourses, but neither of
   these compromises will do: the book is a unit, and is either wholly
   genuine or wholly a fiction.

   Nor are the negative critics agreed as to the time of composition.
   Under the increasing pressure of argument and evidence they have been
   forced to retreat, step by step, from the last quarter of the second
   century to the first, even within a few years of John's death, and
   within the lifetime of hundreds of his hearers, when it was impossible
   for a pseudo-Johannean book to pass into general currency without the
   discovery of the fraud. Dr. Baur and Schwegler assigned the composition
   to a.d. 170 or 160; Volkmar to 155; Zeller to 150; Scholten to 140;
   Hilgenfeld to about 130; Renan to about 125; Schenkel to 120 or 115;
   until Keim (in 1867) went up as high as 110 or even 100, but having
   reached such an early date, he felt compelled (1875) [1092] in
   self-defence to advance again to 130, and this notwithstanding the
   conceded testimonies of Justin Martyr and the early Gnostics. These
   vacillations of criticism reveal the impossibility of locating the
   Gospel in the second century.

   If we surrender the fourth Gospel, what shall we gain in its place?
   Fiction for fact, stone for bread, a Gnostic dream for the most
   glorious truth.

   Fortunately, the whole anti-Johannean hypothesis breaks down at every
   point. It suffers shipwreck on innumerable details which do not fit at
   all into the supposed dogmatic scheme, but rest on hard facts of
   historical recollections. [1093]

   And instead of removing any difficulties it creates greater
   difficulties in their place. There are certain contradictions which no
   ingenuity can solve. If "the great unknown" was the creative artist of
   his ideal Christ, and the inventor of those sublime discourses, the
   like of which were never heard before or since, he must have been a
   mightier genius than Dante or Shakespeare, yea greater than his own
   hero, that is greater than the greatest: this is a psychological
   impossibility and a logical absurdity. Moreover, if he was not John and
   yet wanted to be known as John, he was a deceiver and a liar: [1094]
   this is a moral impossibility. The case of Plato is very different, and
   his relation to Socrates is generally understood. The Synoptic Gospels
   are anonymous, but do not deceive the reader. Luke and the author of
   the Epistle to the Hebrews honestly make themselves known as mere
   disciples of the apostles. The real parallel would be the apocryphal
   Gospels and the pseudo-Clementine productions, where the fraud is
   unmistakable, but the contents are so far below the fourth Gospel that
   a comparison is out of the question. Literary fictions were not
   uncommon in the ancient church, but men had common sense and moral
   sense then as well is now to distinguish between fact and fiction,
   truth and lie. It is simply incredible that the ancient church should
   have been duped into a unanimous acceptance of such an important book
   as the work of the beloved disciple almost from the very date of his
   death, and that the whole Christian church, Greek, Latin, Protestant,
   including an innumerable army of scholars, should have been under a
   radical delusion for eighteen hundred years, mistaking a Gnostic dream
   for the genuine history of the Saviour of mankind, and drinking the
   water of life from the muddy source of fraud. [1095]

   In the meantime the fourth Gospel continues and will continue to shine,
   like the sun in heaven, its own best evidence, and will shine all the
   brighter when the clouds, great and small, shall have passed away.

   [1085] Before him Edward Evanson, an ex-clergyman of the Church of
   England, had attacked John and all other Gospels except Luke, in The
   Dissonance of the Four generally received Evangelists, 1792. He was
   refuted by the Unitarian, Dr. Priestley, who came to the conclusion
   that the Gospel of John "bears more internal and unequivocal marks of
   being written by an eye-witness than any other writings whatever,
   sacred or profane." See his Letters to a Young Man (Works, vol. XX.
   430).

   [1086] Ueber die Composition und den Charakter des joh. Evangeliums, an
   essay in the "Theol. Jahrücher" of Zeller, Tübingen, 1844; again in his
   Krit. Untersuchungen über die kanon. Evang., Tüb., 1847, and in his
   Kirchengesch., 1853(vol. I., pp. 146 sqq., 166 sqq., third ed.). Godet
   (I. 17) calls the first dissertation of Baur justly "one of the most
   ingenious and brilliant compositions which theological science ever
   produced."

   [1087] From Wittichen and Scholten.

   [1088] Especially from Hilgenfeld. The tradition of the Ephesian
   sojourn of John is one of the strongest and most constant in the
   ancient church, and goes back to Polycrates, Irenaeus, Polycarp, and
   Papias, the very pupils and grandpupils of John, who could not possibly
   be mistaken on such a simple fact as this.

   [1089] Dr. Weiss (Leben Jesu, I. 106) accords to Dr. Baur the merit of
   having penetrated deeper into the peculiar character of the fourth
   Gospel and done more for the promotion of its understanding then the
   mechanical old exegesis, which had no conception of the difference and
   looked only for dicta probantia; but he justly adds that Baur's
   criticism is "sicklied all over with the pale cast" of modern
   philosophical construction (von der Blässe moderner philosophischer
   Construction angekränkelt). We are prepared to say the same of Dr.
   Keim, a proud, but noble and earnest spirit who died of overwork in
   elaborating his History of Jesus of Nazara. The most scholarly,
   high-toned, and singularly able argument in the English language
   against the Johannean authorship of the fourth Gospel is the article
   "Gospels" in the "Encycl. Brit.," 9th ed., vol. X. 818-843 (1879), from
   the pen of Dr. Edwin A. Abbott, head-master of the City of London
   School.

   [1090] Without detracting from the merits of the many worthy champions
   of the cause of truth, I venture to give the palm to Dr. Godet, of
   Neuchâtel, in the introductory volume to his third and thoroughly
   revised Commentary on John (Introduction historique et critique, Paris,
   1881, 376 pages), and to Dr. Weiss, of Berlin, in his very able Leben
   Jesu, Berlin, 1882, vol. I. 84-198. In England the battle has been
   fought chiefly by Bishop Lightfoot, Canon Westcott, Prof. Milligan, and
   Dr. Sanday. In America, Dr. Ezra Abbot (1880) is equal to any of them
   in the accurate and effective presentation of the historical argument
   for the Johannean authorship of the fourth Gospel. His treatise has
   been reprinted in his Critical Essays, Boston, l888 (pp. 9-107).

   [1091] "Tout est possible," says Renan (L'Église chrét., p. 54), "à
   cesépoques ténébreuses; et, si l'Église, en vénérant le quatrième
   Évangile comme l'oeuvre de Jean, est dupe de celui qu'elle regarde
   comme un de ses plus dangereux ennemis, cela n'est pas en somme plus
   étrange que tant d'autres malentendus qui composent la trame de
   l'histoire religieuse de l'humanité. Ce qu'il y a de sûr, c'est que
   l'auteur est à la fois le père et l'adversaire du gnosticisme, l'ennemi
   de ceux qui laissaient s'evaporer dans un docétisme nuageux l'humanité
   réelle de Jésus et le complice de ceus qui le reléguaient dans
   l'abstraction divine." He thinks it more probable, however (p. 47),
   that two Ephesian disciples of John (John the Presbyter and Aristion)
   wrote the Gospel twenty or thirty years after his death.

   [1092] In the last edition of his abridged Geschichte Jesu.

   [1093] As Weiss (I. 109) admirably expresses it: "Ueberall im Einzelnen
   wie in der Gesammtgestaltung des Lebens Jesu stossen wir auf das harte
   Gestein geschichtlicher Erinnerung, welches dem kritischen
   Auflösungsprozess, der es in ideelle Bildungen verwandeln will,
   unüberwindlichen Widerstand leistet."

   [1094] "Als die Dichtung eines halbgnostischen Philosophen aus dem
   zweiten Jahrhundert ist es [the fourth Gospel] ein trügerisches
   Irrlicht, ja in Wahrheit eine grosse Lüge,"Weiss, I. 124. Renan admits
   the alternative, only in milder terms:"Il y a là un petit artifice
   littéraire, du genre de ceux qu'affectionne Platon," l.c., p. 52.

   [1095] This absurdity is strikingly characterized in the lines of the
   Swabian poet, Gustav Schwab, which he gave me when I was a student at
   Tübingen shortly after the appearance of Strauss's Leben Jesu: "Hat
   dieses Buch, das ew'ge Wahrheit ist, Ein lügenhafter Gnostiker
   geschrieben, So hat seit tausend Jahren Jesus Christ Den Teufel durch
   Beelzebub vertrieben."

   The Acts and the Third Gospel.

   The book of Acts, though placed by the ancient ecclesiastical division
   not in the "Gospel," but in the "Apostle," is a direct continuation of
   the third Gospel, by the same author, and addressed to the same
   Theophilus, probably a Christian convert of distinguished social
   position. In the former he reports what he heard and read, in the
   latter what he heard and saw. The one records the life and work of
   Christ, the other the work of the Holy Spirit, who is recognized at
   every step. The word Spirit, or Holy Spirit, occurs more frequently in
   the Acts than in any other book of the New Testament. It might properly
   be called "the Gospel of the Holy Spirit."

   The universal testimony of the ancient church traces the two books to
   the same author. This is confirmed by internal evidence of identity of
   style, continuity of narrative, and correspondence of plan. About fifty
   words not found elsewhere in the New Testament are common to both
   books. [1096]

   Object and Contents

   The Acts is a cheerful and encouraging book, like the third Gospel; it
   is full of missionary zeal and hope; it records progress after
   progress, conquest after conquest, and turns even persecution and
   martyrdom into an occasion of joy and thanksgiving. It is the first
   church history. It begins in Jerusalem and ends in Rome. An additional
   chapter would probably have recorded the terrible persecution of Nero
   and the heroic martyrdom of Paul and Peter. But this would have made
   the book a tragedy; instead of that it ends as cheerfully and
   triumphantly as it begins.

   It represents the origin and progress of Christianity from the capital
   of Judaism to the capital of heathenism. It is a history of the
   planting of the church among the Jews by Peter, and among the Gentiles
   by Paul. Its theme is expressed in the promise of the risen Christ to
   his disciples (Acts 1:8): "Ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit
   is come upon you (Acts 2): and ye shall be my witnesses both in
   Jerusalem (Acts 3-7), and in all Judaea and Samaria (Acts 8-12), and
   unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 13-28). The Gospel of Luke,
   which is the Pauline Gospel, laid the foundation by showing how
   salvation, coming from the Jews and opposed by the Jews, was intended
   for all men, Samaritans and Gentiles. The Acts exhibits the progress of
   the church from and among the Jews to the Gentiles by the ministry of
   Peter, then of Stephen, then of Philip in Samaria, then of Peter again
   in the conversion of Cornelius, and at last by the labors of Paul and
   his companions. [1097]

   The Acts begins with the ascension of Christ, or his accession to his
   throne, and the founding of his kingdom by the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit; it closes with the joyful preaching of the Apostle of the
   Gentiles in the capital of the then known world.

   The objective representation of the progress of the church is the chief
   aim of the work, and the subjective and biographical features are
   altogether subordinate. Before Peter, the hero of the first or
   Jewish-Christian division, and Paul, the hero of the second or
   Gentile-Christian part, the other apostles retire and are only once
   named, except John, the elder James, Stephen, and James, the brother of
   the Lord. Even the lives of the pillar-apostles appear in the history
   only so far as they are connected with the missionary work. In this
   view the long-received title of the book, added by some other hand than
   the author's, is not altogether correct, though in keeping with ancient
   usage (as in the apocryphal literature, which includes "Acts of
   Pilate," "Acts of Peter and Paul," "Acts of Philip," etc.). More than
   three-fifths of it are devoted to Paul, and especially to his later
   labors and journeys, in which the author could speak from personal
   knowledge. The book is simply a selection of biographical memoirs of
   Peter and Paul connected with the planting of Christianity or the
   beginnings of the church (Origines Ecclesiae).

   Sources.

   Luke, the faithful pupil and companion of Paul, was eminently fitted to
   produce the history of the primitive church. For the first part he had
   the aid not only of oral tradition, but she of Palestinian documents,
   as he had in preparing his Gospel. Hence the Hebrew coloring in the
   earlier chapters of Acts; while afterward he writes as pure Greek, as
   in the classical prologue of his Gospel. Most of the events in the
   second part came under his personal observation. Hence he often speaks
   in the plural number, modestly including himself. [1098] The "we"
   sections begin Acts 16:10, when Paul started from Troas to Macedonia
   (a.d. 51); they break off when he leaves philippi for corinth (17:1);
   they are resumed (20:5, 6) when he visits macedonia again seven years
   later (58), and then continue to the close of the narrative (a.d. 63).
   Luke probably remained several years at Philippi, engaged in missionary
   labors, until Paul's return. He was in the company of Paul, including
   the interruptions, at least twelve years. He was again with Paul in his
   last captivity, shortly before his martyrdom, his most faithful and
   devoted companion (2 Tim. 4:11).

   Time of Composition.

   Luke probably began the book of Acts or a preliminary diary during his
   missionary journeys with Paul in Greece, especially in Philippi, where
   he seems to have tarried several years; he continued it in Caesarea,
   where he had the best opportunity to gather reliable information of the
   earlier history, from Jerusalem, and such living witnesses as Cornelius
   and his friends, from Philip and his daughters, who resided in
   Caesarea; and he finished it soon after Paul's first imprisonment in
   Rome, before the terrible persecution in the summer of 64, which he
   could hardly have left unnoticed.

   We look in vain for any allusion to this persecution and the martyrdom
   of Paul or Peter, or to any of their Epistles, or to the destruction of
   Jerusalem, or to the later organization of the church, or the
   superiority of the bishop over the presbyter (Comp. Acts 20:17, 28), or
   the Gnostic heresies, except by way of prophetic warning (20:30). This
   silence in a historical work like this seems inexplicable on the
   assumption that the book was written after a.d. 70, or even after 64.
   But if we place the composition before, the martyrdom of Paul, then the
   last verse is after all an appropriate conclusion of a missionary
   history of Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome. For the bold and free
   testimony of the Apostle of the Gentiles in the very heart of the
   civilized world was the sign and pledge of victory.

   The Acts and the Gospels.

   The Acts is the connecting link between the Gospels and Epistles. It
   presupposes and confirms the leading events in the life of Christ, on
   which the church is built. The fact of the resurrection, whereof the
   apostles were witnesses, sends a thrill of joy and an air of victory
   through the whole book. God raised Jesus from the dead and mightily
   proclaimed him to be the Messiah, the prince of life and a Saviour in
   Israel; this is the burden of the sermons of Peter, who shortly before
   had denied his Master. He boldly bears witness to it before the people,
   in his pentecostal sermon, before the Sanhedrin, and before Cornelius.
   Paul likewise, in his addresses at Antioch in Pisidia, at Thessalonica,
   on the Areopagus before the Athenian philosophers, and at Caesarea
   before Festus and Agrippa, emphasizes the resurrection without which
   his own conversion never could have taken place.

   The Acts and the Epistles.

   The Acts gives us the external history of the apostolic church; the
   Epistles present the internal life of the same. Both mutually
   supplement and confirm each other by a series of coincidences in all
   essential points. These coincidences are all the more conclusive as
   they are undesigned and accompanied by slight discrepancies in minor
   details. Archdeacon Paley made them the subject of a discussion in his
   Horae Paulinae, [1099] which will retain its place among classical
   monographs alongside of James Smith's Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul.
   Arguments such as are furnished in these two books are sufficient to
   silence most of the critical objections against the credibility of Acts
   for readers of sound common sense and unbiased judgment. There is not
   the slightest trace that Luke had read any of the thirteen Epistles of
   Paul, nor that Paul had read a line of Acts. The writings were
   contemporaneous and independent, yet animated by the same spirit. Luke
   omits, it is true, Paul's journey to Arabia, his collision with Peter
   at Antioch, and many of his trials and persecutions; but he did not aim
   at a full biography. The following are a few examples of these
   conspicuously undesigned coincidences in the chronological order:

   The Acts and Secular History.

   The Acts brings Christianity in contact with the surrounding world and
   makes many allusions to various places, secular persons and events,
   though only incidentally and as far as its object required it. These
   allusions are--with a single exception, that of Theudas--in full
   harmony with the history of the age as known from Josephus and heathen
   writers, and establish Luke's claim to be considered a well-informed,
   honest, and credible historian. Bishop Lightfoot asserts that no
   ancient work affords so many tests of veracity, because no other has
   such numerous points of contact in all directions with contemporary
   history, politics, and typography, whether Jewish or Greek or Roman.
   The description of persons introduced in the Acts such as Gamaliel,
   Herod, Agrippa I., Bernice, Felix, Festus, Gallio, agrees as far as it
   goes entirely with what we know from contemporary sources. The
   allusions to countries, cities, islands, in Syria, Asia Minor, Greece,
   and Italy are without exception correct and reveal an experienced
   traveller. We mention the chief points, some of which are crucial
   tests.

   1. The rebellion of Theudas, Acts 5:36, alluded to in the speech of
   Gamaliel, which was delivered about a.d. 33. Here is, apparently, a
   conflict with Josephus, who places this event in the reign of Claudius,
   and under the procuratorship of Cuspius Fadus, a.d. 44, ten or twelve
   years after Gamaliel's speech. [1100] But he mentions no less than
   three insurrections which took place shortly after the death of Herod
   the Great, one under the lead of Judas (who may have been Theudas or
   Thaddaeus, the two names being interchangeable, comp. Matt. 10:3; Luke
   6:16), and he adds that besides these there were many highway robbers
   and murderers who pretended to the name of king. [1101] At all events,
   we should hesitate to charge Luke with an anachronism. He was as well
   informed as Josephus, and more credible. This is the only case of a
   conflict between the two, except the case of the census in Luke 2:2,
   and here the discovery of a double governorship of Quirinius has
   brought the chronological difficulty within the reach of solution.
   [1102]

   2. The rebellion of Judas of Galilee, mentioned in the same speech,
   Acts 5:37, as having occurred in the days of the enrolment (the census
   of Quirinius), is confirmed by Josephus. [1103] The insurrection of
   this Judas was the most vigorous attempt to throw off the Roman yoke
   before the great war.

   3. Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, 8:27. Strabo mentions a queen of
   Meroè in Ethiopia, under that name, which was probably, like Pharaoh, a
   dynastic title. [1104]

   4. The famine under Claudius, 11:28. This reign (a.d. 41-54) was
   disturbed by frequent famines, one of which, according to Josephus,
   severely affected Judaea and Syria, and caused great distress in
   Jerusalem under the procuratorship of Cuspius Fadus, a.d. 45. [1105]

   5. The death of King Herod Agrippa I. (grandson of Herod the Great),
   12:20-23. Josephus says nothing about the preceding persecution of the
   church, but reports in substantial agreement with Luke that the king
   died of a loathsome disease in the seventh year of his reign (a.d. 44),
   five days after he had received, at the theatre of Caesarea, divine
   honors, being hailed, in heathen fashion, as a god by his courtiers.
   [1106]

   6. The proconsular (as distinct from the propraetorian) status of
   Cyprus, under Sergius Paulus, 13:7 (sun to anthupato Sergio Paulo).
   Here Luke was for a long time considered inaccurate, even by Grotius,
   but has been strikingly confirmed by modern research. When Augustus
   assumed the supreme power (b.c. 27), he divided the government of the
   provinces with the Senate, and called the ruler of the imperatorial
   provinces, which needed direct military control under the emperor as
   commander of the legions, propraetor (antistrategos) or legate
   (presbutes), the ruler of a senatorial province, proconsul
   (anthupatos). Formerly these terms had signified that the holder of the
   office had previously been praetor (strategosor hegemon) or consul
   (hupatos); now they signified the administrative heads of the
   provinces. But this subdivision underwent frequent changes, so that
   only a well-informed person could tell the distinction at any time.
   Cyprus was in the original distribution (b.c. 27) assigned to the
   emperor, [1107] but since b.c. 22, and at the time of Paul's visit
   under Claudius, it was a senatorial province; [1108] and hence Sergius
   Paulus is rightly called proconsul. Coins have been found from the
   reign of Claudius which confirm this statement. [1109] Yea, the very
   name of (Sergius) Paulus has been discovered by General di Cesnola at
   Soli (which, next to Salamis, was the most important city of the
   island), in a mutilated inscription, which reads: "in the proconsulship
   of Paulus." [1110] Under Hadrian the island was governed by a
   propraetor; under Severus, again by a proconsul.

   7. The proconsular status of Achaia under Gallio, 18:12 (Gallionos
   anthupatou ontos tes Achaias). Achaia, which included the whole of
   Greece lying south of Macedonia, was originally a senatorial province,
   then an imperatorial province under Tiberius, and again a senatorial
   province under Claudius. [1111] In the year 53-54, when Paul was at
   Corinth, M. Annaeus Novatus Gallio, the brother of the philosopher L.
   Annaeus Seneca, was proconsul of Achaia, and popularly esteemed for his
   mild temper as "dulcis Gallio."

   8. Paul and Barnabas mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in Lycaonia, 14:11.
   According to the myth described by Ovid, [1112] the gods Jupiter and
   Mercury (Zeus and Hermes) had appeared to the Lycaonians in the
   likeness of men, and been received by Baucis and Philemon, to whom they
   left tokens of that favor. The place where they had dwelt was visited
   by devout pilgrims and adorned with votive offerings. How natural,
   therefore, was it for these idolaters, astonished by the miracle, to
   mistake the eloquent Paul for Hermes, and Barnabas who may have been of
   a more imposing figure, for Zeus.

   9. The colonial dignity of the city of Philippi, in Macedonia, 16:12
   ("a Roman colony," kolonia; comp. 16:21, "being Romans"). Augustus had
   sent a colony to the famous battlefield where Brutus and the Republic
   expired, and conferred on the place new importance and the privileges
   of Italian or Roman citizenship (jus Italicum). [1113]

   10. "Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira," 16:14.
   Thyatira (now Akhissar), in the valley of Lycus in Asia Minor, was
   famous for its dying works, especially for purple or crimson. [1114]

   11. The "politarchs" of Thessalonica, 17:6, 8. [1115] This was a very
   rare title for magistrates, and might easily be confounded with the
   more usual designation "poliarchs." But Luke's accuracy has been
   confirmed by an inscription still legible on an archway in
   Thessalonica, giving the names of seven "politarchs" who governed
   before the visit of Paul. [1116]

   12. The description of Athens, the Areopagus, the schools of
   philosophy, the idle curiosity and inquisitiveness of the Athenians
   (mentioned also by Demosthenes), the altar of an unknown God, and the
   quotation from Aratus or Cleanthes, in Acts 17, are fully borne out by
   classical authorities. [1117]

   13. The account of Ephesus in the nineteenth chapter has been verified
   as minutely accurate by the remarkable discoveries of John T. Wood,
   made between 1863 and 1874, with the aid of the English Government. The
   excessive worship of Diana, "the great goddess of Artemis," the
   temple-warden, the theatre (capable of holding twenty-five thousand
   people) often used for public assemblies, the distinct officers of the
   city, the Roman proconsul (anthupatos), the recorder or "town-clerk"
   (grammateus), and the Asiarchs (Asiarchai) or presidents of the games
   and the religious ceremonials, have all reappeared in ruins and on
   inscriptions, which may now be studied in the British Museum. "With
   these facts in view," says Lightfoot, "we are justified in saying that
   ancient literature has preserved no picture of the Ephesus of imperial
   times--the Ephesus which has been unearthed by the sagacity and
   perseverance of Mr. Wood--comparable for its life-like truthfulness to
   the narrative of St. Paul's sojourn there in the Acts." [1118]

   14. The voyage and shipwreck of Paul in Acts 27. This chapter contains
   more information about ancient navigation than any work of Greek or
   Roman literature, and betrays the minute accuracy of an intelligent
   eye-witness, who, though not a professional seaman, was very familiar
   with nautical terms from close observation. He uses no less than
   sixteen technical terms, some of them rare, to describe the motion and
   management of a ship, and all of them most appropriately; and he is
   strictly correct in the description of the localities at Crete,
   Salmone, Fair Havens, Cauda, Lasea and Phoenix (two small places
   recently identified), and Melita (Malta), as well as the motions and
   effects of the tempestuous northeast wind called Euraquilo (A. V.
   Euroclydon) in the Mediterranean. All this has been thoroughly tested
   by an expert seaman and scholar, James Smith, of Scotland, who has
   published the results of his examination in the classical monograph
   already mentioned. [1119] Monumental and scientific evidence outweighs
   critical conjectures, and is an irresistible vindication of the
   historical accuracy and credibility of Luke.

   The Acts an Irenicum.

   But some critics have charged the Acts with an intentional
   falsification of history in the interest of peace between the Petrine
   and Pauline sections of the church. The work is said to be a Catholic
   Irenicum, based probably on a narrative of Luke, but not completed
   before the close of the first century, for the purpose of harmonizing
   the Jewish and Gentile sections of the church by conforming the two
   leading apostles, i.e., by raising Peter to the Pauline and lowering
   Paul to the Petrine Plane, and thus making both subservient to a
   compromise between Judaizing bigotry and Gentile freedom. [1120]

   The chief arguments on which this hypothesis is based are the
   suppression of the collision between Paul and Peter at Antioch, and the
   friendly relation into which Paul is brought to James, especially at
   the last interview. Acts 15 is supposed to be in irreconcilable
   conflict with Galatian. But a reaction has taken place in the Tübingen
   school, and it is admitted now by some of the ablest critics that the
   antagonism between Paulinism and Petrinism has been greatly exaggerated
   by Baur, and that Acts is a far more trustworthy account than he was
   willing to admit. The Epistle to the Galatians itself is the best
   vindication of the Acts, for it expressly speaks of a cordial agreement
   between Paul and the Jewish pillar-apostles. As to the omission of the
   collision between Peter and Paul at Antioch, it was merely a passing
   incident, perhaps unknown to Luke, or omitted because it had no bearing
   on the course of events recorded by him. On the other hand, he mentions
   the "sharp contention" between Paul and Barnabas, because it resulted
   in a division of the missionary work, Paul and Silas going to Syria and
   Cilicia, Barnabas and Mark sailing away to Cyprus (15:39-41). Of this
   Paul says nothing, because it had no bearing on his argument with the
   Galatians. Paul's conciliatory course toward James and the Jews, as
   represented in the Acts, is confirmed by his own Epistles, in which he
   says that he became a Jew to the Jews, as well as a Gentile to the
   Gentiles, in order to gain them both, and expresses his readiness to
   make the greatest possible sacrifice for the salvation of his brethren
   after the flesh (1 Cor. 9:20; Rom. 9:3).

   The Truthfulness of the Acts.

   The book of Acts is, indeed, like every impartial history, an Irenicum,
   but a truthful Irenicum, conceived in the very spirit of the Conference
   at Jerusalem and the concordat concluded by the leading apostles,
   according to Paul's own testimony in the polemical Epistle to the
   Galatians. The principle of selection required, of course, the omission
   of a large number of facts and incidents. But the selection was made
   with fairness and justice to all sides. The impartiality and
   truthfulness of Luke is very manifest in his honest record of the
   imperfections of the apostolic church. He does not conceal the
   hypocrisy and mean selfishness of Ananias and Sapphira, which
   threatened to poison Christianity in its cradle (Acts 5:1 sqq.); he
   informs us that the institution of the diaconate arose from a complaint
   of the Grecian Jews against their Hebrew brethren for neglecting their
   widows in the daily ministration (61 sqq.) he represents Paul and
   Barnabas as "men of like passions" with other men (14:15), and gives us
   some specimens of weak human nature in Mark when he became discouraged
   by the hardship of missionary life and returned to his mother in
   Jerusalem (13:13), and in Paul and Barnabas when they fell out for a
   season on account of this very Mark, who was a cousin of Barnabas
   (15:39); nor does he pass in silence the outburst of Paul's violent
   temper when in righteous indignation he called the high-priest a
   "whited wall" (23:3); and he speaks of serious controversies and
   compromises even among the apostles under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit--all for our humiliation and warning as well as comfort and
   encouragement.

   Examine and compare the secular historians from Herodotus to Macaulay,
   and the church historians from Eusebius to Neander, and Luke need not
   fear a comparison. No history of thirty years has ever been written so
   truthful and impartial, so important and interesting, so healthy in
   tone and hopeful in spirit, so aggressive and yet so genial, so
   cheering and inspiring, so replete with lessons of wisdom and
   encouragement for work in spreading the gospel of truth and peace, and
   yet withal so simple and modest, as the Acts of the Apostles. It is the
   best as well as the first manual of church history.

   sind."Renan speaks in the same confident tone (Les Apôtres, pp. x. and

   dissents from this view and vainly tries to show that while both books
   originated in the school of Paul, the third evangelist elevates
   Paulinism above Jewish Christianity, and the author of Acts recommends
   Paul to the Jewish-Christian party. The Gospel is polemical, the Acts
   apologetic. Das Paulinische Evangelium, etc., transl. from the Dutch by

   [1098] Ewald, in his Commentary on Acts (1872), pp. 35 sqq., infers

   none other than Luke of Antioch, the "beloved" friend and colaborer of
   Paul. Renan says (La apôtres, p. xiv.): "Je persiste à croire que le
   dernier rédacteur des Acts est bien le disciple de Paul qui dit
   'nous'aux derniers chapitres,"but he puts the composition down to a.d.
   71 or 72 (p. xx.), and in his Les Évangiles, ch. xix., pp. 435 sqq.,
   still later, to the age of Domitian.

   streets of Athens; and Diogenes Laërtius (Epimen., c. 3) speaks of
   "altars without name" in many parts of Athens. It is supposed that Paul
   meant one of these altars, or that he ingeniously adapted the
   polytheistic inscription to his argument. In the dialogue Philopatris
   which is erroneously ascribed to Lucian, one of the speakers swears "by
   the unknown god of Athens."

   could not be otherwise, as we know the history of religions only from
   the reports of believers; "i il n'y a que le sceptique qui écrive
   l'histoire ad narrandum."

   § 86. The Epistles.

   The sermons of Stephen and the apostles in Acts (excepting the farewell
   of Paul to the Ephesian Elders) are missionary addresses to outsiders,
   with a view to convert them to the Christian faith. The Epistles are
   addressed to baptized converts, and aim to strengthen them in their
   faith, and, by brotherly instruction, exhortation, rebuke, and
   consolation, to build up the church in all Christian graces on the
   historical foundation of the teaching and example of Christ. The
   prophets of the Old Testament delivered divine oracles to the people;
   the apostles of the New Testament wrote letters to the brethren, who
   shared with them the same faith and hope as members of Christ.

   The readers are supposed to be already "in Christ," saved and
   sanctified "in Christ," and holding all their social and domestic
   relations and discharging their duties "in Christ." They are "grown
   together" [1121] with Christ, sharing in his death, burial, and
   resurrection, and destined to reign and rule with him in glory forever.
   On the basis of this new relation, constituted by a creative act of
   divine grace, and sealed by baptism, they are warned against every sin
   and exhorted to every virtue. Every departure from their profession and
   calling implies double guilt and double danger of final ruin.

   Occasions and calls for correspondence were abundant, and increased
   with the spread of Christianity over the Roman empire. The apostles
   could not be omnipresent and had to send messengers and letters to
   distant churches. They probably wrote many more letters than we
   possess, although we have good reason to suppose that the most
   important and permanently valuable are preserved. A former letter of
   Paul to the Corinthians is implied in 1 Cor. 5:9: "I wrote to you in my
   epistle;" [1122] and traces of further correspondence are found in 1
   Cor. 16:3; 2 Cor. 10:9; Eph. 3:3. The letter "from Laodicea," referred
   to in Col. 4:16, is probably the encyclical Epistle to the Ephesians.

   The Epistles of the New Testament are without a parallel in ancient
   literature, and yield in importance only to the Gospels, which stand
   higher, as Christ himself rises above the apostles. They are pastoral
   letters to congregations or individuals, beginning with an inscription
   and salutation, consisting of doctrinal expositions and practical
   exhortations and consolations, and concluding with personal
   intelligence, greetings, and benediction. They presuppose throughout
   the Gospel history, and often allude to the death and resurrection of
   Christ as the foundation of the church and the Christian hope. They
   were composed amidst incessant missionary labors and cares, under trial
   and persecution, some of them from prison, and yet they abound in joy
   and thanksgiving. They were mostly called forth by special emergencies,
   yet they suit all occasions. Tracts for the times, they are tracts for
   all times. Children of the fleeting moment, they contain truths of
   infinite moment. They compress more ideas in fewer words than any other
   writings, human or divine, excepting the Gospels. They discuss the
   highest themes which can challenge an immortal mind--God, Christ, and
   the Spirit, sin and redemption, incarnation, atonement, regeneration,
   repentance, faith and good works, holy living and dying, the conversion
   of the world, the general judgment, eternal glory and bliss. And all
   this before humble little societies of poor, uncultured artisans,
   freedmen and slaves! And yet they are of more real and general value to
   the church than all the systems of theology from Origen to
   Schleiermacher--yea, than all the confessions of faith. For eighteen
   hundred years they have nourished the faith of Christendom, and will
   continue to do so to the end of time. This is the best evidence of
   their divine inspiration.

   The Epistles are divided into two groups, Catholic and Pauline. The
   first is more general; the second bears the strong imprint of the
   intense personality of the Apostle of the Gentiles.

   Introduction, to the Catholic Epp., Edinb., 1887.

   The seven Epistles of James, 1st and 2d Peter, 1st, 2d, and 3d John,
   and Jude usually follow in the old manuscripts the Acts of the
   Apostles, and precede the Pauline Epistles, perhaps as being the works
   of the older apostles, and representing, in part at least, the Jewish
   type of Christianity. They are of a more general character, and
   addressed not to individuals or single congregations, as those of Paul,
   but to a larger number of Christians scattered through a district or
   over the world. Hence they are called, from the time of Origen and
   Eusebius, Catholic. This does not mean in this connection
   anti-heretical (still less, of course, Greek Catholic or Roman
   Catholic), but encyclical or circular. The designation, however, is not
   strictly correct, and applies only to five of them. The second and
   third Epistles of John are addressed to individuals. On the other hand
   the Epistle to the Hebrews is encyclical, and ought to be numbered with
   the Catholic Epistles, but is usually appended to those of Paul. The
   Epistle to the Ephesians is likewise intended for more than one
   congregation. The first Christian document of an encyclical character
   is the pastoral letter of the apostolic Conference at Jerusalem (a.d.
   50) to the Gentile brethren in Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:23-29).
   [1123]

   The Catholic Epistles are distinct from the Pauline by their more
   general contents and the absence of personal and local references. They
   represent different, though essentially harmonious, types of doctrine
   and Christian life. The individuality of James, Peter, and John stand
   out very prominently in these brief remains of their correspondence.
   They do not enter into theological discussions like those of Paul, the
   learned Rabbi, and give simpler statements of truth, but protest
   against the rising ascetic and Antinomian errors, as Paul does in the
   Colossians and Pastoral Epistles. Each has a distinct character and
   purpose, and none could well be spared from the New Testament without
   marring the beauty and completeness of the whole.

   The time of composition cannot be fixed with certainty, but is probably
   as follows: James before a.d. 50; 1st Peter (probably also 2d Peter and
   Jude) before a.d. 67; John between a.d. 80 and 100.

   Only two of these Epistles, the 1st of Peter and the 1st of John,
   belong to the Eusebian Homologumena, which were universally accepted by
   the ancient church as inspired and canonical. About the other five
   there was more or less doubt as to their origin down to the close of
   the fourth century, when all controversy on the extent of the canon
   went to sleep till the time of the Reformation. Yet they bear the
   general imprint of the apostolic age, and the absence of stronger
   traditional evidence is due in part to their small size and limited
   use.

   James.

   Comp. on the lit., biography, and doctrine of James, §§ 27 and 69.

   The Epistle of James the Brother of the Lord was written, no doubt,
   from Jerusalem, the metropolis of the ancient theocracy and Jewish
   Christianity, where the author labored and died a martyr at the head of
   the mother church of Christendom and as the last connecting link
   between the old and the new dispensation. It is addressed to the Jews
   and Jewish Christians of the dispersion before the final doom in the
   year 70.

   It strongly resembles the Gospel of Matthew, and echoes the Sermon on
   the Mount in the fresh, vigorous, pithy, proverbial, and sententious
   style of oriental wisdom. It exhorts the readers to good works of
   faith, warns them against dead orthodoxy, covetousness, pride, and
   worldliness, and comforts them in view of present and future trials and
   persecutions. It is eminently practical and free from subtle
   theological questions. It preaches a religion of good works which
   commends itself to the approval of God and all good men. It represents
   the primary stage of Christian doctrine. It takes no notice of the
   circumcision controversy, the Jerusalem compromise, and the later
   conflicts of the apostolic age. Its doctrine of justification is no
   protest against that of Paul, but prior to it, and presents the subject
   from a less developed, yet eminently practical aspect, and against the
   error of a barren monotheism rather than Pharisaical legalism, which
   Paul had in view. It is probably the oldest of the New Testament books,
   meagre in doctrine, but rich in comfort and lessons of holy living
   based on faith in Jesus Christ, "the Lord of glory." It contains more
   reminiscences of the words of Christ than any other epistle. [1124] Its
   leading idea is "the perfect law of freedom," or the law of love
   revealed in Christ.

   Luther's harsh, unjust, and unwise judgment of this Epistle has been
   condemned by his own church, and reveals a defect in his conception of
   the doctrine of justification which was the natural result of his
   radical war with the Romish error.

   Peter.

   See on the lit., biography, and theology of Peter, §§ 25, 26, and 70.

   The First Epistle of Peter, dated from Babylon, [1125] belongs to the
   later life of the apostle, when his ardent natural temper was deeply
   humbled, softened, and sanctified by the work of grace. It was written
   to churches in several provinces of Asia Minor, composed of Jewish and
   Gentile Christians together, and planted mainly by Paul and his
   fellow-laborers; and was sent by the hands of Silvanus, a former
   companion of Paul. It consists of precious consolations, and
   exhortations to a holy walk after the example of Christ, to joyful hope
   of the heavenly inheritance, to patience under the persecutions already
   raging or impending. It gives us the fruit of a rich spiritual
   experience, and is altogether worthy of Peter and his mission to tend
   the flock of God under Christ, the chief shepherd of souls. [1126]

   It attests also the essential agreement of Peter with the doctrine of
   the Gentile apostle, in which the readers had been before instructed (1
   Pet. 5:12). This accords with the principle of Peter professed at the
   Council in Jerusalem (Acts 15:11) that we are saved without the yoke of
   the law, "through the grace of the Lord Jesus." His doctrinal system,
   however, precedes that of Paul and is independent of it, standing
   between James and Paul. Peculiar to him is the doctrine of the descent
   of Christ into Hades (1 Pet. 3:19; 4:6; comp. Acts 2:32), which
   contains the important truth of the universal intent of the atonement.
   Christ died for all men, for those who lived before as well as after
   his coming, and he revealed himself to the spirits in the realm of
   Hades. Peter also warns against hierarchical ambition in prophetic
   anticipation of the abuse of his name and his primacy among the
   apostles.

   The Second Epistle of Peter is addressed, shortly before the author's
   death, as a sort of last will and testament, to the same churches as
   the first. It contains a renewed assurance of his agreement with his
   "beloved brother Paul," to whose Epistles he respectfully refers, yet
   with the significant remark (true in itself, yet often abused by
   Romanists) that there are in them "some things hard to be understood"
   (2 Pet. 3:15, 16). As Peter himself receives in one of these Epistles
   (Gal. 2:11) a sharp rebuke for his inconsistency at Antioch (which may
   be included in the hard things), this affectionate allusion proves how
   thoroughly the Spirit of Christ had, through experience, trained him to
   humility, meekness, and self-denial. The Epistle exhorts the readers to
   diligence, virtue, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly love, and
   brotherly kindness; refers to the Transfiguration on the Mount, where
   the author witnessed the majesty of Christ, and to the prophetic word
   inspired by the Holy Spirit; warns against antinomian errors; corrects
   a mistake concerning the second coming; exhorts them to prepare for the
   day of the Lord by holy living, looking for new heavens and a new earth
   wherein dwelleth righteousness; and closes with the words: "Grow in the
   grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be
   glory both now and forever."

   The second Epistle is reckoned by Eusebius among the seven
   Antilegomena, and its Petrine authorship is doubted or denied, in whole
   or in part, by many eminent divines [1127] but defended by competent
   critics. [1128] The chief objections are: the want of early
   attestation, the reference to a collection of the Pauline Epistles, the
   polemic against Gnostic errors, some peculiarities of style, and
   especially the apparent dependence of the second chapter on the Epistle
   of Jude.

   On the other hand, the Epistle, at least the first and third chapters,
   contains nothing which Peter might not have written, and the allusion
   to the scene of transfiguration admits only the alternative: either
   Peter, or a forger. It seems morally impossible that a forger should
   have produced a letter so full of spiritual beauty and unction, and
   expressly denouncing all cunning fabrications. It may have been
   enlarged by the editor after Peter's death. But the whole breathes an
   apostolic spirit, and could not well be spared from the New Testament.
   It is a worthy valedictory of the aged apostle awaiting his martyrdom,
   and with its still valid warnings against internal dangers from false
   Christianity, it forms a suitable complement to the first Epistle,
   which comforts the Christians amidst external dangers from heathen and
   Jewish persecutors.

   Jude.

   The Epistle of Jude, a, "brother of James" (the Just), [1129] is very
   short, and strongly resembles 2 Peter 2, but differs from it by an
   allusion to the remarkable apocryphal book of Enoch and the legend of
   the dispute of Michael with the devil about the body of Moses. It seems
   to be addressed to the same churches and directed against the same
   Gnostic heretics. It is a solemn warning against the antinomian and
   licentious tendencies which revealed themselves between a.d. 60 and 70.
   Origen remarks that it is "of few lines, but rich in words of heavenly
   wisdom." The style is fresh and vigorous.

   The Epistle of Jude belongs likewise to the Eusebian Antilegomena, and
   has signs of post-apostolic origin, yet may have been written by Jude,
   who was not one of the Twelve, though closely connected with apostolic
   circles. A forger would hardly have written under the name of a
   "brother of James" rather than a brother of Christ or an apostle.

   The time and place of composition are unknown. The Tübingen critics put
   it down to the reign of Trajan; Renan, on the contrary, as far back as
   54, wrongly supposing it to have been intended, together with the
   Epistle of James, as a counter-manifesto against Paul's doctrine of
   free grace. But Paul condemned antinomianism as severely as James and
   Jude (comp. Rom. 6, and in fact all his Epistles). It is safest to say,
   with Bleek, that it was written shortly before the destruction of
   Jerusalem, which is not alluded to (comp. Jude 14, 15).

   The Epistles of John.

   Comp. §§ 40-43, 83 and 84.

   The First Epistle of John betrays throughout, in thought and style, the
   author of the fourth Gospel. It is a postscript to it, or a practical
   application of the lessons of the life of Christ to the wants of the
   church at the close of the first century. It is a circular letter of
   the venerable apostle to his beloved children in Asia Minor, exhorting
   them to a holy life of faith and love in Christ, and earnestly warning
   them against the Gnostic "antichrists," already existing or to come,
   who deny the mystery of the incarnation, sunder religion from morality,
   and run into Antinomian practices.

   The Second and Third Epistles of John are, like the Epistle of Paul to
   Philemon, short private letters, one to a Christian woman by the name
   of Cyria, the other to one Gains, probably an officer of a congregation
   in Asia Minor. They belong to the seven Antilegomena, and have been
   ascribed by some to the "Presbyter John," a contemporary of the
   apostle, though of disputed existence. But the second Epistle resembles
   the first, almost to verbal repetition, [1130] and such repetition well
   agrees with the familiar tradition of Jerome concerning the apostle of
   love, ever exhorting the congregation, in his advanced age, to love one
   another. The difference of opinion in the ancient church respecting
   them may have risen partly from their private nature and their brevity,
   and partly from the fact that the author styles himself, somewhat
   remarkably, the "elder," the "presbyter." This term, however, is
   probably to be taken, not in the official sense, but in the original,
   signifying age and dignity; for at that time John was in fact a
   venerable father in Christ, and must have been revered and loved as a
   patriarch among his "little children."

   [1123] Hence Origen calls it an epistole katholike.

   [1124] Reuss (Gesch. d. heil. Schriften N. Testaments, 5th ed., I.
   138): "Thatsache ist, dass die Ep. Jacobi für sich allein mehr
   wörtliche Reminiscenzen aus den Reden Jesu enthält als alle übrigen
   Apost. Schriften zusammen .... Insofern dieselben offenbar nicht aus
   schriftlichen Quellen geflossen sind, mögen sie mit das höhere Alter
   deg Briefs verbürgen." Beyschlag (in the new ed. of Huther in Meyer,
   1881) and Erdmann (1881), the most recent commentators of James, agree
   with Schneckenburger, Neander, and Thiersch in assigning the Epistle to
   the earliest date of Christian literature, against the Tübingen school,
   which makes it a polemical treatise against Paul. Reuss occupies a
   middle position. The undeveloped state of Christian doctrine, the use
   of sunagoge for a Christian assembly (James 2:2), the want of a clear
   distinction between Jews and Jewish Christians, who are addressed as
   "the twelve tribes," and the expectation of the approaching parousia
   (5:8), concur as signs of the high antiquity.

   [1125] Commentators are divided on the meaning of Babylon, 1 Pet. 5:13,
   whether it be the mystic Babylon of the Apocalypse, i.e., heathen Rome,
   as a persecuting power (the fathers, Roman Catholic divines, also
   Thiersch, Baur, Renan), or Babylon on the Euphrates, or Babylon in
   Egypt (old Cairo). The question is connected with Peter's presence in
   Rome, which has been discussed in § 26. On the date of composition
   commentators are likewise divided, as they differ in their views on the
   relation of Peter's Epistle to Romans, Ephesians, and James, and on the
   character of the persecution alluded to in the Epistle. Weiss, who
   denies that Peter used the Epistles of Paul, dates it back as far as
   54; the Tübingen critics bring it down to the age of Trajan (Volkmar
   even to 140!), but most critics assign it to the time between 63 and
   67, Renan to 63, shortly before the Neronian persecution. For once I
   agree with him. See Huther (in the Meyer series), 4th ed., pp. 30 sqq.;
   Weiss, Die Petrinische Frage (1865); Renan, L'Antechrist, p. vi and
   110; and, on the part of the Tübingen school, Pfleiderer, Paulinismus,

   Einleitung, pp. 514 sqq. (2d ed.).

   [1126] "This excellent Epistle," says Archbishop Leighton, whose
   Practical Commentary upon the First Epistle General of St. Peter is
   still unsurpassed for spirituality and unction, "is a brief and yet
   very clear summary both of the consolations and instructions needful
   for the encouragement and direction of a Christian in his journey to
   heaven, elevating his thoughts and desires to that happiness, and
   strengthening him against all opposition in the way, both that of
   corruption within and temptations and afflictions from without."
   Bengel: "Mirabilis est gravitas et alacritas Petrini sermonis, lectorem
   suavissime retinens." Alford: "There is no Epistle in the sacred canon,
   the language and spirit of which come more directly home to the
   personal trials and wants and weaknesses of the Christian life."

   § 88. The Epistles of Paul

   Paulos genomeno; megistos; hupogrammos. (Clement of Rome.)

   Comp. §§ 29-36 and 71.

   General Character.

   Paul was the greatest worker among the apostles, not only as a
   missionary, but also as a writer. He "labored more than all." And we
   may well include in this "all" the whole body of theologians who came
   after him; for where shall we find an equal wealth of the profoundest
   thoughts on the highest themes as in Paul? We have from him thirteen
   Epistles; how many more were lost, we cannot even conjecture. The four
   most important of them are admitted to be genuine even by the most
   exacting and sceptical critics. They are so stamped with the
   individuality of Paul, and so replete with tokens of his age and
   surroundings, that no sane man can mistake the authorship. We might as
   well doubt the genuineness of Luther's work on the Babylonian
   captivity, or his Small catechism. The heretic Marcion, in the first
   half of the second century, accepted ten, excluding only the three
   Pastoral Epistles which did not suit his notions.

   The Pauline Epistles are pastoral addresses to congregations of his own
   founding (except that of Rome, and probably also that of Colossae,
   which were founded by his pupils), or to individuals (Timothy, Titus,
   Philemon). Several of them hail from prison, but breathe the same
   spirit of faith, hope, and joy as the others, and the last ends with a
   shout of victory. They proceeded from profound agitation, and yet are
   calm and serene. They were occasioned by the trials, dangers, and
   errors incident to every new congregation, and the care and anxiety of
   the apostle for their spiritual welfare. He had led them from the
   darkness of heathen idolatry and Jewish bigotry to the light of
   Christian truth and freedom, and raised them from the slime of
   depravity to the pure height of saving grace and holy living. He had no
   family ties, and threw the whole strength of his affections into his
   converts, whom he loved as tenderly as a mother can love her offspring.
   [1131] This love to his spiritual children was inspired by his love to
   Christ, as his love to Christ was the response to Christ's love for
   him. Nor was his love confined to the brethren: he was ready to make
   the greatest sacrifice for his unbelieving and persecuting fellow-Jews,
   as Christ himself sacrificed his life for his enemies.

   His Epistles touch on every important truth and duty of the Christian
   religion, and illuminate them from the heights of knowledge and
   experience, without pretending to exhaust them. They furnish the best
   material for a system of dogmatics and ethics. Paul looks back to the
   remotest beginning before the creation, and looks out into the farthest
   future beyond death and the resurrection. He writes with the authority
   of a commissioned apostle and inspired teacher, yet, on questions of
   expediency, he distinguishes between the command of the Lord and his
   private judgment. He seems to have written rapidly and under great
   pressure, without correcting his first draft. If we find, with Peter,
   in his letters, "some things hard to be understood," even in this
   nineteenth century, we must remember that Paul himself bowed in
   reverence before the boundless ocean of God's truth, and humbly
   professed to know only in part, and to see through a mirror darkly. All
   knowledge in this world "ends in mystery." [1132] Our best systems of
   theology are but dim reflections of the sunlight of revelation.
   Infinite truths transcend our finite minds, and cannot be compressed
   into the pigeon-holes of logical formulas. But every good commentary
   adds to the understanding and strengthens the estimate of the paramount
   value of these Epistles.

   The Chronological Order.

   Paul's Epistles were written within a period of about twelve years,
   between a.d. 52 or 53 and 64 or 67, when he stood at the height of his
   power and influence. None was composed before the Council of Jerusalem.
   From the date of his conversion to his second missionary journey (a.d.
   37 to 52) we have no documents of his pen. The chronology of his
   letters can be better ascertained than that of the Gospels or Catholic
   Epistles, by combining internal indications with the Acts and
   contemporary events, such as the dates of the proconsulship of Gallio
   in Achaia, and the procuratorship of Felix and Festus in Judaea. As to
   the Romans, we can determine the place, the year, and the season of
   composition: he sends greetings from persons in Corinth (Rom. 16:23),
   commends Phoebe, a deaconess of Kenchreae, the port of Corinth, and the
   bearer of the letter (16:1); he had not yet been in Rome (1:13), but
   hoped to get there after another visit to Jerusalem, on which he was
   about to enter, with collections from Macedonia and Achaia for the poor
   brethren in Judaea (15:22-29; comp. 2 Cor. 8:1-3); and from Acts we
   learn that on his last visit to Achaia he abode three months in
   Corinth, and returned to Syria between the Passover and Pentecost (Acts
   20:3, 6, 16). This was his fifth and last journey to Jerusalem, where
   he was taken prisoner and sent to Felix in Caesarea, two years before
   he was followed by Festus. All these indications lead us to the spring
   of a.d. 58.

   The chronological order is this: Thessalonians were written first, a.d.
   52 or 53; then Galatians, Corinthians, and Romans, between 56 and 58;
   then the Epistles of the captivity: Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon,
   Philippians, between 61 and 63; last, the Pastoral Epistles, but their
   date is uncertain, except that the second Epistle to Timothy is his
   farewell letter on the eve of his martyrdom.

   It is instructive to study the Epistles in their chronological order
   with the aid of the Acts, and so to accompany the apostle in his
   missionary career from Damascus to Rome, and to trace the growth of his
   doctrinal system from the documentary truths in Thessalonians to the
   height of maturity in Romans; then through the ramifications of
   particular topics in Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and the
   farewell counsels in the Pastoral Epistles.

   Doctrinal Arrangement.

   More important than the chronological order is the topical order,
   according to the prevailing object and central idea. This gives us the
   following groups:

   1. Anthropological and Soteriological: Galatians and Romans.

   2. Ethical and Ecclesiastical: First and Second Corinthians.

   3. Christological: Colossians and Philippians.

   4. Ecclesiological: Ephesians (in part also Corinthians).

   5. Eschatological: Thessalonians.

   6. Pastoral: Timothy and Titus.

   7. Social and Personal: Philemon.

   The Style.

   "The style is the man." This applies with peculiar force to Paul. His
   style has been called "the most personal that ever existed." [1133] It
   fitly represents the force and fire of his mind and the tender
   affections of his heart. He disclaims classical elegance and calls
   himself "rude in speech," though by no means "in knowledge." He carried
   the heavenly treasure in earthen vessels. But the defects are more than
   made up by excellences. In his very weakness the Strength of Christ was
   perfected. We are not lost in the admiration of the mere form, but are
   kept mindful of the paramount importance of the contents and the hidden
   depths of truth which he behind the words and defy the power of
   expression.

   Paul's style is manly, bold, heroic, aggressive, and warlike; yet at
   times tender, delicate, gentle, and winning. It is involved, irregular,
   and rugged, but always forcible and expressive, and not seldom rises to
   more than poetic beauty, as in the triumphant paean at the end of the
   eighth chapter of Romans, and in the ode on love (1 Cor. 13). His
   intense earnestness and overflowing fulness of ideas break through the
   ordinary rules of grammar. His logic is set on fire. He abounds in
   skilful arguments, bold antitheses, impetuous assaults, abrupt
   transitions, sudden turns, zigzag flashes, startling questions and
   exclamations. He is dialectical and argumentative; he likes logical
   particles, paradoxical phrases, and plays on words. He reasons from
   Scripture, from premises, from conclusions; he drives the opponent to
   the wall without mercy and reduces him ad absurdum, but without ever
   indulging in personalities. He is familiar with the sharp weapons of
   ridicule, irony, and sarcasm, but holds them in check and uses them
   rarely. He varies the argument by touching appeals to the heart and
   bursts of seraphic eloquence. He is never dry or dull, and never wastes
   words; he is brief, terse, and hits the nail on the head. His terseness
   makes him at times obscure, as is the case with the somewhat similar
   style of Thucydides, Tacitus, and Tertullian. His words are as many
   warriors marching on to victory and peace; they are like a mountain
   torrent rushing in foaming rapids over precipices, and then calmly
   flowing over green meadows, or like a thunderstorm ending in a
   refreshing shower and bright sunshine.

   Paul created the vocabulary of scientific theology and put a profounder
   meaning into religious and moral terms than they ever had before. We
   cannot speak of sin, flesh, grace, mercy, peace, redemption, atonement,
   justification, glorification, church, faith, love, without bearing
   testimony to the ineffaceable effect which that greatest of Jewish
   rabbis and Christian teachers has had upon the language of Christendom.

   Notes.

   Chrysostom justly compares the Epistles of Paul to metals more precious
   than gold and to unfailing fountains which flow the more abundantly the
   more we drink of them.

   Beza: "When I more closely consider the whole genius and character of
   Paul's style, I must confess that I have found no such sublimity of
   speaking in Plato himself ... no exquisiteness of vehemence in
   Demosthenes equal to his."

   Ewald begins his Commentary on the Pauline Epistles (Göttingen, 1857)
   with these striking and truthful remarks: "Considering these Epistles
   for themselves only, and apart from the general significance of the
   great Apostle of the Gentiles, we must still admit that, in the whole
   history of all centuries and of all nations, there is no other set of
   writings of similar extent, which, as creations of the fugitive moment,
   have proceeded from such severe troubles of the age, and such profound
   pains and sufferings of the author himself, and yet contain such an
   amount of healthfulness, serenity, and vigor of immortal genius, and
   touch with such clearness and certainty on the very highest truths of
   human aspiration and action .... The smallest as well as the greatest
   of these Epistles seem to have proceeded from the fleeting moments of
   this earthly life only to enchain all eternity they were born of
   anxiety and bitterness of human strife, to set forth in brighter lustre
   and with higher certainty their superhuman grace and beauty. The divine
   assurance and firmness of the old prophets of Israel, the
   all-transcending glory and immediate spiritual presence of the Eternal
   King and Lord, who had just ascended to heaven, and all the art and
   culture of a ripe and wonderfully excited age, seem to have joined, as
   it were, in bringing forth the new creation of these Epistles of the
   times which were destined to last for all times."

   On the style of Paul, see my Companion, etc., pp. 62 sqq. To the
   testimonies there given I add the judgment of Reuss (Geschichte der h.
   Schr. N. T., I. 67): "Still more [than the method] is the style of
   these Epistles the true expression of the personality of the author.
   The defect of classical correctness and rhetorical finish is more than
   compensated by the riches of language and the fulness of expression.
   The condensation of construction demands not reading simply, but
   studying. Broken sentences, ellipses, parentheses, leaps in the
   argumentation, allegories, rhetorical figures express inimitably all
   the moods of a wide-awake and cultured mind, all the affections of a
   rich and deep heart, and betray everywhere a pen at once bold, and yet
   too slow for the thought. Antitheses, climaxes, exclamations, questions
   keep up the attention, and touching effusions win the heart of the
   reader."

   § 89. The Epistles to the Thessalonians.

   Thessalonica, [1134] a large and wealthy commercial city of Macedonia,
   the capital of "Macedonia secunda," the seat of a Roman proconsul and
   quaestor, and inhabited by many Jews, was visited by Paul on his second
   missionary tour, a.d. 52 or 53, and in a few weeks he succeeded, amid
   much persecution, in founding a flourishing church composed chiefly of
   Gentiles. From this centre Christianity spread throughout the
   neighborhood, and during the middle ages Thessalonica was, till its
   capture by the Turks (a.d. 1430), a bulwark of the Byzantine empire and
   Oriental Christendom, and largely instrumental in the conversion of the
   Slavonians and Bulgarians; hence it received the designation of "the
   Orthodox City." It numbered many learned archbishops, and still has
   more remains of ecclesiastical antiquity than any other city in Greece,
   although its cathedral is turned into a mosque.

   To this church Paul, as its spiritual father, full of affection for his
   inexperienced children, wrote in familiar conversational style two
   letters from Corinth, during his first sojourn in that city, to comfort
   them in their trials and to correct certain misapprehensions of his
   preaching concerning the glorious return of Christ, and the preceding
   development of "the man of sin" or Antichrist, and "the mystery of
   lawlessness," then already at work, but checked by a restraining power.
   The hope of the near advent had degenerated into an enthusiastic
   adventism which demoralized the every-day life. He now taught them that
   the Lord will not come so soon as they expected, that it was not a
   matter of mathematical calculation, and that in no case should the
   expectation check industry and zeal, but rather stimulate them. Hence
   his exhortations to a sober, orderly, diligent, and prayerful life.

   It is remarkable that the first Epistles of Paul should treat of the
   last topic in the theological system and anticipate the end at the
   beginning. But the hope of Christ's speedy coming was, before the
   destruction of Jerusalem, the greatest source of consolation to the
   infant church amid trial and persecution, and the church at
   Thessalonica was severely tried in its infancy, and Paul driven away.
   It is also remarkable that to a young church in Greece rather than to
   that in Rome should have first been revealed the beginning of that
   mystery of anti-Christian lawlessness which was then still restrained,
   but was to break out in its full force in Rome. [1135]

   The objections of Baur to the genuineness of these Epistles, especially
   the second, are futile in the judgment of the best critics. [1136]

   The Theoretical Theme:: The parousia of Christ. The Practical Theme:
   Christian hope in the midst of persecution.

   Leading Thoughts: This is the will of God, even your sanctification (1
   Thess. 4:3). Sorrow not as the rest who have no hope (4:13). The Lord
   will descend from heaven, and so shall we ever be with the Lord (4:16,
   17). The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night (5:2). Let
   us watch and be sober (5:6). Put on the breastplate of faith and love,
   and for a helmet, the hope of salvation (5:8). Rejoice always; pray
   without ceasing; in everything give thanks (5:16). Prove all things;
   hold fast that which is good; abstain from every form of evil (5:21,
   22). The Lord will come to be glorified in his saints (2 Thess. 1:10).
   But the falling away must come first, and the man of sin be revealed,
   the son of perdition (2:3, 4). The mystery of lawlessness doth already
   work, but is restrained for the time (2:7). Stand fast and hold the
   traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours
   (2:15). If any will not work, neither let him eat (3:10). Be not weary
   in well-doing (3:13). The God of peace sanctify you wholly; and may
   your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the
   coming (e-in -ite parousia) our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thess. 5:23).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1134] Strabo calls it Thessalonikaia. Its present name is Salonichi.

   [1135] The difficult passage, 2 Thess. 2:1-12, must be explained in
   connection with the prophecies of Daniel (the fourth empire) and the
   Apocalypse. See the commentaries of Lünemann, Lange (Riggenbach,
   translated by Lillie), Ellicott, Jowett, Marcus Dods, and the Excursus
   of Farrar on the Man of Sin (St. Paul, II. 583-587). Many modern
   exegetes adopt the patristic interpretation that "the restraining
   power" (to katechon) is the Roman empire, "the restrainer" (ho
   katechon) the then reigning emperor (Claudius), and "the man of sin"
   his successor, Nero. But the last is very doubtful. The whole passage
   must have a prophetic sweep far beyond the time of the old Roman
   empire. There are "many antichrists" and many restraining forces and
   persons in the successive ages, and the end is yet apparently afar off.
   "Obviously, whatever the words signify, they must mean something which
   has existed from Paul's day to our own, something which, during that
   whole period, has had the effect of restraining wickedness." (Dods, in
   Schaff's Com. on the N. T, III 535.)

   [1136] Grimm, Lünemann, Reuss, Lipsius, and others have refuted the
   arguments of Baur. The first Epistle is conceded to be genuine also by
   Hilgenfeld, who declares (Einleit., p 246):"In dem ganzen Brief erkennt
   man die Sprache des Paulus. Es ist kein Grund vorhanden, denselben dem
   Paulus abzusprechen. Nicht so bedeutsam, wie andere Briefe, ist
   derselbe eines Paulus keineswegs unwürdig, vielmehr ein liebenswürdiges
   Denkmal väterlicher Fürsorge des Apostels für eine junge
   Christengemeinde." But the second Ep. to the Thess. Hilgenfeld assigns
   to the age of Trajan, as a sort of Pauline Apocalypse; thus reversing
   the view of Baur, who regarded the First Ep. as an imitation of the
   second. Grotius and Ewald put the Second Ep. likewise first (especially
   on account of 1 Thess. 1:7, 8, which seems to imply that the
   congregation had already become famous throughout Greece), but they
   regarded both as genuine.

   § 90. The Epistles to the Corinthians.

   Corinth was the metropolis of Achaia, on the bridge of two seas, an
   emporium of trade between the East and the West--wealthy, luxurious,
   art-loving, devoted to the worship of Aphrodite. Here Paul established
   the most important church in Greece, and labored, first eighteen
   months, then three months, with, perhaps, a short visit between (2 Cor.
   12:14; 13:1). The church presented all the lights and shades of the
   Greek nationality under the influence of the Gospel. It was rich in
   "all utterance and all knowledge," "coming behind in no gift," but
   troubled by the spirit of sect and party, infected with a morbid desire
   for worldly wisdom and brilliant eloquence, with scepticism and moral
   levity--nay, to some extent polluted with gross vices, so that even the
   Lord's table and love feasts were desecrated by excesses, and that the
   apostle, in his absence, found himself compelled to excommunicate a
   particularly offensive member who disgraced the Christian profession.
   [1137] It was distracted by Judaizers and other troublers, who abused
   the names of Cephas, James, Apollos, and even of Christ (as
   extra-Christians), for sectarian ends. [1138] A number of questions of
   morality and casuistry arose in that lively, speculative, and excitable
   community, which the apostle had to answer from a distance before his
   second (or third) and last visit.

   Hence, these Epistles abound in variety of topics, and show the
   extraordinary versatility of the mind of the writer, and his practical
   wisdom in dealing with delicate and complicated questions and
   unscrupulous opponents. For every aberration he has a word of severe
   censure, for every danger a word of warning, for every weakness a word
   of cheer and sympathy, for every returning offender a word of pardon
   and encouragement. The Epistles lack the unity of design which
   characterizes Galatians and Romans. They are ethical, ecclesiastical,
   pastoral, and personal, rather than dogmatic and theological, although
   some most important doctrines, as that on the resurrection, are treated
   more fully than elsewhere.

   I. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was composed in Ephesus shortly
   before Paul's departure for Greece, in the spring of a.d. 57. [1139] It
   had been preceded by another one, now lost (1 Cor. 5:9). It was an
   answer to perplexing questions concerning various disputes and evils
   which disturbed the peace and spotted the purity of the congregation.
   The apostle contrasts the foolish wisdom of the gospel with the wise
   folly of human philosophy; rebukes sectarianism; unfolds the spiritual
   unity and harmonious variety of the church of Christ, her offices and
   gifts of grace, chief among which is love; warns against carnal
   impurity as a violation of the temple of God; gives advice concerning
   marriage and celibacy without binding the conscience (having "no
   commandment of the Lord," 7:25); discusses the question of meat
   sacrificed to idols, on which Jewish and Gentile Christians, scrupulous
   and liberal brethren, were divided; enjoins the temporal support of the
   ministry as a Christian duty of gratitude for greater spiritual mercies
   received; guards against improprieties of dress; explains the design
   and corrects the abuses of the Lord's Supper; and gives the fullest
   exposition of the doctrine of the resurrection on the basis of the
   resurrection of Christ and his personal manifestations to the
   disciples, and last, to himself at his conversion. Dean Stanley says of
   this Epistle that it "gives a clearer insight than any other portion of
   the New Testament into the institutions, feelings and opinions of the
   church of the earlier period of the apostolic age. It is in every sense
   the earliest chapter of the history of the Christian church." The last,
   however, is not quite correct. The Corinthian chapter was preceded by
   the Jerusalem and Antioch chapters.

   Leading Thoughts: Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you (1 Cor.
   1:13) ? It was God's pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching
   [not through foolish preaching] to save them that believe (1:21). We
   preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto
   Gentiles foolishness, but unto them that are called, both Jews and
   Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God (1:24). I
   determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus, and him
   crucified (2:2). The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
   of God (2:14). Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid,
   which is Jesus Christ (3:11). Know ye not that ye are a temple of God,
   and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man destroy the
   temple of God, him shall God destroy (3:16, 17). Let a man so account
   of ourselves as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries
   of God (4:1). The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power (4:20).
   Purge out the old leaven (5:7). All things are lawful for me; but not
   all things are expedient (6:12). Know ye not that your bodies are
   members of Christ (6:15) ? Flee fornication (6:18). Glorify God in your
   body (6:20). Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing;
   but the keeping of the commandments of God (7:19). Let each man abide
   in that calling wherein he was called (7:20). Ye were bought with a
   price; become not bondservants of men (7:23). Take heed lest this
   liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak (8:9). If meat
   [or wine] maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh [and drink
   no wine] for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble (8:13).
   They who proclaim the gospel shall live of the gospel (9:14). Woe is
   unto me if I preach not the gospel (9:16). I am become all things to
   all men, that I may by all means save some (9:22). Let him that
   thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall (10:12). All things are
   lawful, but all things are not expedient. Let no man seek his own, but
   each his neighbor's good (10:23). Whosoever shall eat the bread or
   drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the
   body and the blood of the Lord ... He that eateth and drinketh eateth
   and drinketh judgment unto himself if he discern (discriminate) not the
   body (11:27-29). There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit
   (12:4). Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of
   these is love (13:13). Follow after love (14:1). Let all things be done
   unto edifying (14:26). By the grace of God I am what I am (15:9). If
   Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
   sins (15:17). As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made
   alive (15:22). God shall be all in all (15:28). If there is a natural
   body, there is also a spiritual body (15:44). This corruptible must put
   on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality (15:54). Be ye
   steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord (15:58).
   Upon the first day in the week let each one of you lay by him in store,
   as he may prosper (16:2). Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you
   like men, be strong. Let all that ye do be done in love (16:13, 14.).

   II. The Second Epistle to the Corinthians was written in the summer or
   autumn of the same year, 57, from some place in Macedonia, shortly
   before the author's intended personal visit to the metropolis of
   Achaia. [1140] It evidently proceeded from profound agitation, and
   opens to us very freely the personal character and feelings, the
   official trials and joys, the noble pride and deep humility, the holy
   earnestness and fervent love, of the apostle. It gives us the deepest
   insight into his heart, and is almost an autobiography. He had, in the
   meantime, heard fuller news, through Titus, of the state of the church,
   the effects produced by his first Epistle, and the intrigues of the
   emissaries of the Judaizing party, who followed him everywhere and
   tried to undermine his work. This unchristian opposition compelled him,
   in self-defence, to speak of his ministry and his personal experience
   with overpowering eloquence. He also urges again upon the congregation
   the duty of charitable collections for the poor. The Epistle is a mine
   of pastoral wisdom.

   Leading Thoughts: As the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so
   our comfort also aboundeth through Christ (2 Cor. 1:5). As ye are
   partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort (1:7). Not
   that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy
   (1:24). Who is sufficient for these things (2:16)? Ye are our epistle,
   written in our hearts, known and read of all men (3:2). Not that we are
   sufficient of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God (3:5). The
   letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life (3:6). The Lord is the
   Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (3:17).
   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as
   your servants for Jesus' sake (4:5). We have this treasure in earthen
   vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and
   not from ourselves (4:7). Our light affliction, which is for the
   moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of
   glory (4:17). We know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be
   dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands,
   eternal, in the heavens (5:1). We walk by faith, not by sight (5:7). We
   must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ (5:10).
   The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that one
   died for all, therefore all died (5:14). And he died for all, that they
   who live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for
   their sakes died and rose again (5:15). If any man is in Christ, he is
   a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become
   new (5:17). God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not
   reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the
   word of reconciliation (5:19). We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be
   ye reconciled to God (5:20). Him who knew no sin he made to be sin in
   our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him
   (5:21). Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers (6:14). I am filled
   with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction (7:4). Godly
   sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, but the sorrow of the world
   worketh death (7:10). Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,
   though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through
   his poverty might become rich (8:9). He that soweth sparingly shall
   reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also
   bountifully (9:6). God loveth a cheerful giver (9:7). He that glorieth,
   let him glory in the Lord (10:17). Not he that commendeth himself is
   approved, but whom the Lord commendeth (10:18). My grace is sufficient
   for thee; for my power is made perfect in weakness (12:9). We can do
   nothing against the truth, but for the truth (13:8). The grace of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy
   Spirit, be with you all (13:14).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1137] Such scandals would be almost incredible in a Christian church
   if the apostle did not tell us so. As to the case of incest, 1 Cor. 5:1
   sqq., we should remember that Corinth was the most licentious city in
   all Greece, and that in the splendid temple of her patron-goddess on
   the Acropolis there were kept more than a thousand sacred female slaves
   (hierodouloi) for the pleasure of strangers. Korinthia kore was the
   name for a courtesan. Chastity was therefore one of the most difficult
   virtues to practice there; and hence the apostle's advice of a radical
   cure by absolute abstinence under the peculiar circumstances of the
   time.

   [1138] The question of the Corinthian parties (with special reference
   to the Christ party) I have discussed at length in my Hist. of the Ap.
   Church, pp. 285-291. Baur's essay on this subject (1831) was the
   opening chapter in the development of the Tübingen theory.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 91. The Epistles to the Galatians.

   Comp. the introduction to my Com. on Gal. (1882).

   Galatians and Romans discuss the doctrines of sin and redemption, and
   the relation of the law and the gospel. They teach salvation by free
   grace and justification by faith, Christian universalism in opposition
   to Jewish particularism, evangelical freedom versus legalistic bondage.
   But Galatians is a rapid sketch and the child of deep emotion, Romans
   an elaborate treatise and the mature product of calm reflexion. The
   former Epistle is polemical against foreign intruders and seducers, the
   latter is irenical and composed in a serene frame of mind. The one
   rushes along like a mountain torrent and foaming cataract, the other
   flows like a majestic river through a boundless prairie; and yet it is
   the same river, like the Nile at the Rapids and below Cairo, or the
   Rhine in the Grisons and the lowlands of Germany and Holland, or the
   St. Lawrence at Niagara Falls and below Montreal and Quebec where it
   majestically branches out into the ocean.

   It is a remarkable fact that the two races represented by the readers
   of these Epistles--the Celtic and the Latin--have far departed from the
   doctrines taught in them and exchanged the gospel freedom for legal
   bondage; thus repeating the apostasy of the sanguine, generous,
   impressible, mercurial, fickle-minded Galatians. The Pauline gospel was
   for centuries ignored, misunderstood, and (in spite of St. Augustin)
   cast out at last by Rome, as Christianity itself was cast out by
   Jerusalem of old. But the overruling wisdom of God made the rule of the
   papacy a training-school of the Teutonic races of the North and West
   for freedom; as it had turned the unbelief of the Jews to the
   conversion of the Gentiles. Those Epistles, more than any book of the
   New Testament, inspired the Reformation of the Sixteenth century, and
   are to this day the Gibraltar of evangelical Protestantism. Luther,
   under a secondary inspiration, reproduced Galatians in his war against
   the "Babylonian captivity of the church;" the battle for Christian
   freedom was won once more, and its fruits are enjoyed by nations of
   which neither Paul nor Luther ever heard.

   The Epistle to the Galatians (Gauls, originally from the borders of the
   Rhine and Moselle, who had migrated to Asia Minor) was written after
   Paul's second visit to them, either during his long residence in
   Ephesus (a.d. 54-57), or shortly afterwards on his second journey to
   Corinth, possibly from Corinth, certainly before the Epistle to the
   Romans. It was occasioned by the machinations of the Judaizing teachers
   who undermined his apostolic authority and misled his converts into an
   apostasy from the gospel of free grace to a false gospel of legal
   bondage, requiring circumcision as a condition of justification and
   full membership of the church. It is an "Apologia pro vita sua," a
   personal and doctrinal self-vindication. He defends his independent
   apostleship (Gal.1:1-2:14), and his teaching (2:15-4:31), and closes
   with exhortations to hold fast to Christian freedom without abusing it,
   and to show the fruits of faith by holy living (Gal. 5-6).

   The Epistle reveals, in clear, strong colors, both the difference and
   the harmony among the Jewish and Gentile apostles--a difference ignored
   by the old orthodoxy, which sees only the harmony, and exaggerated by
   modern scepticism, which sees only the difference. It anticipates, in
   grand fundamental outlines, a conflict which is renewed from time to
   time in the history of different churches, and, on the largest scale,
   in the conflict between Petrine Romanism and Pauline Protestantism. The
   temporary collision of the two leading apostles in Antioch is typical
   of the battle of the Reformation.

   At the same time Galatians is an Irenicon and sounds the key-note of a
   final adjustment of all doctrinal and ritualistic controversies. "In
   Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision, but faith working through love" (5:6). "And as many as
   shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the
   Israel of God" (6:16).

   Central Idea: Evangelical freedom.

   Key-Words: For freedom Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be
   not entangled again in the yoke of bondage (5:1). A man is not
   justified by works of the law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ
   (2:16). I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that
   live but Christ liveth in me (2:20). Christ redeemed us from the curse
   of the law, having become a curse for us (3:13). Ye were called for
   freedom, only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but
   through love be servants one to another (5:13). Walk by the Spirit, and
   ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh (5:16).
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 92. The Epistle to the Romans.

   On the church in Rome, see § 36 (pp. 360 sqq.); on the theology of the
   Ep. to the Rom., § 71 (pp. 525 sqq.).

   A few weeks before his fifth and last journey to Jerusalem, Paul sent,
   as a forerunner of his intended personal visit, a letter to the
   Christians in the capital of the world, which was intended by
   Providence to become the Jerusalem of Christendom. Foreseeing its
   future importance, the apostle chose for his theme: The gospel the
   power of God unto salvation to every believer, the Jew first, and also
   the Gentile (Rom. 1:16, 17). Writing to the philosophical Greeks, he
   contrasts the wisdom of God with the wisdom of man. To the world-ruling
   Romans he represents Christianity as the power of God which by
   spiritual weapons will conquer even conquering Rome. Such a bold idea
   must have struck a Roman statesman as the wild dream of a visionary or
   madman, but it was fulfilled in the ultimate conversion of the empire
   after three centuries of persecution, and is still in the process of
   ever-growing fulfilment.

   In the exposition of his theme the apostle shows: (1) that all men are
   in need of salvation, being under the power of sin and exposed to the
   judgment of the righteous God, the Gentiles not only (1:18-32), but
   also the Jews, who are still more guilty, having sinned against the
   written law and extraordinary privileges (2:1-3:20); (2) that salvation
   is accomplished by Jesus Christ, his atoning death and triumphant
   resurrection, freely offered to all on the sole condition of faith, and
   applied in the successive acts of justification, sanctification, and
   glorification (3:21-8:17); (3) that salvation was offered first to the
   Jews, and, being rejected by them in unbelief, passed on to the
   Gentiles, but will return again to the Jews after the fulness of the
   Gentiles shall have come in (Rom. 9-11); (4) that we should show our
   gratitude for so great a salvation by surrendering ourselves to the
   service of God, which is true freedom (Rom. 12-16).

   The salutations in Rom. 16, the remarkable variations of the
   manuscripts in 15:33; 16:20, 24, 27, and the omission of the words "in
   Rome," 1:7, 15, in Codex G, are best explained by the conjecture that
   copies of the letter were also sent to Ephesus (where Aquila and
   Priscilla were at that time, 1 Cor. 16:19, and again, some years
   afterwards, 2 Tim. 4:19), and perhaps to other churches with
   appropriate conclusions, all of which are preserved in the present
   form. [1141]

   This letter stands justly at the head of the Pauline Epistles. It is
   more comprehensive and systematic than the others, and admirably
   adapted to the mistress of the world, which was to become also the
   mistress of Western Christendom. It is the most remarkable production
   of the most remarkable man. It is his heart. It contains his theology,
   theoretical and practical, for which he lived and died. It gives the
   clearest and fullest exposition of the doctrines of sin and grace and
   the best possible solution of the universal dominion of sin and death
   in the universal redemption by the second Adam. Without this redemption
   the fall is indeed the darkest enigma and irreconcilable with the idea
   of divine justice and goodness. Paul reverently lifts the veil from the
   mysteries of eternal foreknowledge and foreordination and God's
   gracious designs in the winding course of history which will end at
   last in the triumph of his wisdom and mercy and the greatest good to
   mankind. Luther calls Romans "the chief book of the New Testament and
   the purest Gospel," Coleridge: "the profoundest book in existence."
   Meyer: "the greatest and richest of all the apostolic works," Godet
   (best of all): "the cathedral of the Christian faith."

   Theme: Christianity the power of free and universal salvation, on
   condition of faith.

   Leading Thoughts: They are all under sin (Rom. 3:9). Through the law
   cometh the knowledge of sin (3:20). Man is justified by faith apart
   from works of the law (3:28). Being justified by faith we have
   (echomenor, let us have, echomen) peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ (5:1). As through one man sin entered into the world, and death
   through sin, and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned
   (5:12): [so through one man righteousness entered into the world, and
   life through righteousness, and so life passed unto all men on
   condition that they believe in Christ and by faith become partakers of
   his righteousness]. Where sin abounded, grace did abound much more
   exceedingly: that as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign
   through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
   (5:20, 21). Reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God
   in Christ Jesus (6:11). There is no condemnation to them that are in
   Christ Jesus (8:1). To them that love God all things work together for
   good (8:28). Whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to
   the image of his Son ... and whom he foreordained them he also called:
   and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them
   he also glorified (8:29, 30). If God is for us, who is against us
   (8:31)? Who shall separate us from the love of Christ (8:35)? Hardening
   in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
   in; and so all Israel shall be saved (11:25). God hath shut up all unto
   disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all (11:32). Of Him, and
   through Him, and unto Him are all things (11:36). Present your bodies a
   living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
   service (12:1).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1141] On the textual variations, see Westcott and Hort, Appendix, pp.
   110-114. Reuss, Ewald, Farrar suppose that Rom. 16 (or 16:3-20) was
   addressed to Ephesus. Renan conjectures that an editor has combined
   four copies of the same encyclical letter of Paul, each addressed to a
   different church and having a different ending. Both these views are
   preferable to Baur's rejection of the last two chapters as spurious;
   though they are full of the Pauline spirit. Hilgenfeld (Einleit., p.
   323) and Pfleiderer (Paulinismus, p. 314) maintain, against Baur, the
   genuineness of Rom. 15 and Rom. 16. On the names in Rom. 16 see the
   instructive discussion of Lightfoot in his Com. on Philippians, pp.
   172-176.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 93. The Epistles of the Captivity.

   During his confinement in Rome, from a.d. 61 to 63, while waiting the
   issue of his trial on the charge of being "a mover of insurrections
   among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect
   of the Nazarenes" (Acts 24:5), the aged apostle composed four Epistles,
   to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon, and Philippians. He thus turned
   the prison into a pulpit, sent inspiration and comfort to his distant
   congregations, and rendered a greater service to future ages than he
   could have done by active labor. He gloried in being a "prisoner of
   Christ." He experienced the blessedness of persecution for
   righteousness' sake (Matt. 5:10), and "the peace of God which passeth
   all understanding" (Phil. 4:7). He often refers to his bonds, and the
   coupling chain or hand-cuff (halusis) by which, according to Roman
   custom, he was with his right wrist fettered day and night to a
   soldier; one relieving the other and being in turn chained to the
   apostle, so that his imprisonment became a means for the spread of the
   gospel "throughout the whole praetorian guard." [1142] He had the
   privilege of living in his own hired lodging (probably in the
   neighborhood of the praetorian camp, outside of the walls, to the
   northeast of Rome), and of free intercourse with his companions and
   distant congregations.

   Paul does not mention the place of his captivity, which extended
   through four years and a half (two at Caesarea, two at Rome, and six
   months spent on the stormy voyage and at Malta). The traditional view
   dates the four Epistles from the Roman captivity, and there is no good
   reason to depart from it. Several modern critics assign one or more to
   Caesarea, where he cannot be supposed to have been idle, and where he
   was nearer to his congregations in Asia Minor. [1143] But in Caesarea
   Paul looked forward to Rome and to Spain; while in the Epistles of the
   captivity he expresses the hope of soon visiting Colossae and Philippi.
   In Rome he had the best opportunity of correspondence with his distant
   friends, and enjoyed a degree of freedom which may have been denied him
   in Caesarea. In Philippians he sends greetings from converts in
   "Caesar's household" (Phil. 4:22), which naturally points to Rome; and
   the circumstances and surroundings of the other Epistles are very much
   alike.

   Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon were composed about the same time
   and sent by the same messengers (Tychicus and Onesimus) to Asia Minor,
   probably toward the close of the Roman captivity, for in Philemon 22,
   he engaged a lodging in Colosae in the prospect of a speedy release and
   visit to the East.

   Philippians we place last in the order of composition, or, at all
   events, in the second year of the Roman captivity; for some time must
   have elapsed after Paul's arrival in Rome before the gospeI could
   spread "throughout the whole praetorian guard" (Phil. 1:13), and before
   the Philippians, at a distance of seven hundred miles from Rome (a full
   month's journey in those days), could receive news from him and send
   him contributions through Epaphroditus, besides other communications
   which seem to have preceded the Epistle. [1144]

   On the other hand, the priority of the composition of Philippians has
   been recently urged on purely internal evidence, namely, its doctrinal
   affinity with the preceding anti-Judaic Epistles; while Colossians and
   Ephesians presuppose the rise of the Gnostic heresy and thus form the
   connecting link between them and the Pastoral Epistles, in which the
   same heresy appears in a more matured form. [1145] But Ephesians has
   likewise striking affinities in thought and language with Romans in the
   doctrine of justification (comp. Eph. 2:8), and with Romans 12 and 1
   Cor. 12 and 1 Cor. 14) in the doctrine of the church. As to the heresy,
   Paul had predicted its rise in Asia Minor several years before in his
   farewell to the Ephesian elders. And, finally, the grateful and joyful
   tone of Philippians falls in most naturally with the lofty and glorious
   conception of the church of Christ as presented in Ephesians.

   § 94. The Epistle to the Colossians.

   The Churches in Phrygia.

   The cities of Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis are mentioned together
   as seats of Christian churches in the closing chapter of Colossians,
   and the Epistle may be considered as being addressed to all, for the
   apostle directs that it be read also in the churches of the Laodiceans
   (Col. 4:13-16). They were situated within a few miles of each other in
   the valley of the Lycus (a tributary of the Maeander) in Phrygia on the
   borders of Lydia, and belonged, under the Roman rule, to the
   proconsular province of Asia Minor.

   Laodicea was the most important of the three, and enjoyed metropolitan
   rank; she was destroyed by a disastrous earthquake a.d. 61 or 65, but
   rebuilt from her own resources without the customary aid from Rome.
   [1146] The church of Laodicea is the last of the seven churches
   addressed in the Apocalypse (Rev. 3:14-22), and is described as rich
   and proud and lukewarm. It harbored in the middle of the fourth century
   (after 344) a council which passed an important act on the canon,
   forbidding the public reading of any but "the canonical books of the
   New and Old Testaments" (the list of these books is a later addition),
   a prohibition which was confirmed and adopted by later councils in the
   East and the West.

   Hierapolis was a famous watering-place, surrounded by beautiful
   scenery, [1147] and the birthplace of the lame slave Epictetus, who,
   with Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, ranks among the first heathen
   moralists, and so closely resembles the lofty maxims of the New
   Testament that some writers have assumed, though without historic
   foundation, a passing acquaintance between him and Paul or his pupil
   Epaphras of Colossae. [1148] The church of Hierapolis figures in the
   post-apostolic age as the bishopric of Papias (a friend of Polycarp)
   and Apollinaris.

   Colossae, [1149] once likewise famous, was at the time of Paul the
   smallest of the three neighboring cities, and has almost disappeared
   from the earth; while magnificent ruins of temples, theatres, baths,
   aqueducts, gymnasia, and sepulchres still testify to the former wealth
   and prosperity of Laodicea and Hierapolis. The church of Colossae was
   the least important of the churches to which Paul addressed an Epistle,
   and it is scarcely mentioned in post-apostolic times; but it gave rise
   to a heresy which shook the church in the second century, and this
   Epistle furnished the best remedy against it.

   There was a large Jewish population in Phrygia, since Antiochus the
   Great had despotically transplanted two thousand Jewish families from
   Babylonia and Mesopotamia to that region. It thus became, in connection
   with the sensuous and mystic tendency of the Phrygian character, a
   nursery of religious syncretism and various forms of fanaticism.

   Paul and the Colossians.

   Paul passed twice through Phrygia, on his second and third missionary
   tours, [1150] but probably not through the valley of the Lycus. Luke
   does not say that he established churches there, and Paul himself seems
   to include the Colossians and Laodiceans among those who had not seen
   his face in the flesh. [1151] He names Epaphras, of Colossae, his "dear
   fellow-servant" and "fellow-prisoner," as the teacher and faithful
   minister of the Christians in that place. [1152] But during his long
   residence in Ephesus (a.d. 54-57) and from his imprisonment he
   exercised a general supervision over all the churches in Asia. After
   his death they passed under the care of John, and in the second century
   they figure prominently in the Gnostic, Paschal, Chiliastic, and
   Montanistic controversies.

   Paul heard of the condition of the church at Colossae through Epaphras,
   his pupil, and Onesimus, a runaway slave. He sent through Tychicus
   (Col. 4:7) a letter to the church, which was also intended for the
   Laodiceans (4:16); at the same time he sent through Onesimus a private
   letter of commendation to his master, Philemon, a member of the church
   of Colossae. He also directed the Colossians to procure and read "the
   letter from Laodicea," [1153] which is most probably the evangelical
   Epistle to the Ephesians which was likewise transmitted through
   Tychicus. He had special reasons for writing to the Colossians and to
   Philemon, and a general reason for writing to all the churches in the
   region of Ephesus; and he took advantage of the mission of Tychicus to
   secure both ends. In this way the three Epistles are closely connected
   in time and aim. They would mutually explain and confirm one another.

   The Colossian Heresy.

   The special reason which prompted Paul to write to the Colossians was
   the rise of a new heresy among them which soon afterward swelled into a
   mighty and dangerous movement in the ancient church, as rationalism has
   done in modern times. It differed from the Judaizing heresy which he
   opposed in Galatians and Corinthians, as Essenism differed from
   Phariseeism, or as legalism differs from mysticism. The Colossian
   heresy was an Essenic and ascetic type of Gnosticism; it derived its
   ritualistic and practical elements from Judaism, its speculative
   elements from heathenism; it retained circumcision, the observance of
   Sabbaths and new moons, and the distinction of meats and drinks; but it
   mixed with it elements of oriental mysticism and theosophy, the heathen
   notion of an evil principle, the worship of subordinate spirits, and an
   ascetic struggle for emancipation from the dominion of matter. It
   taught an antagonism between God and matter and interposed between them
   a series of angelic mediators as objects of worship. It thus contained
   the essential features of Gnosticism, but in its incipient and
   rudimental form, or a Christian Essenism in its transition to
   Gnosticism. In its ascetic tendency it resembles that of the weak
   brethren in the Roman congregation (Rom. 14:5, 6, 21). Cerinthus, in
   the age of John, represents a more developed stage and forms the link
   between the Colossian heresy and the post-apostolic Gnosticism. [1154]

   The Refutation.

   Paul refutes this false philosophy calmly and respectfully by the true
   doctrine of the Person of Christ, as the one Mediator between God and
   men, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And he meets
   the false asceticism based upon the dualistic principle with the
   doctrine of the purification of the heart by faith and love as the
   effectual cure of all moral evil.

   The Gnostic and the Pauline Pleroma.

   "Pleroma" or "fulness" is an important term in Colossians and
   Ephesians. [1155] Paul uses it in common with the Gnostics, and this
   has been made an argument for the post-apostolic origin of the two
   Epistles. He did, of course, not borrow it from the Gnostics; for he
   employs it repeatedly in his other Epistles with slight variations. It
   must have had a fixed theological meaning, as it is not explained. It
   cannot be traced to Philo, who, however, uses "Logos" in a somewhat
   similar sense for the plenitude of Divine powers.

   Paul speaks of "the pleroma of the earth," i.e., all that fills the
   earth or is contained in it (1 Cor. 10:26, 28, in a quotation from Ps.
   24:1); "the pleroma," i.e., the fulfilment or accomplishment, "of the
   law," which is love (Rom. 13:10 [1156] ); "the pleroma," i.e., the
   fulness or abundance, "of the blessing of Christ" ( Rom. 15:29) "the
   pleroma," or full measure, "of the time" ( Gal. 4:4; comp. Eph. 1:10;
   Mark 1:15; Luke 21:24); "the pleroma of the Gentiles," meaning their
   full number, or whole body, but not necessarily all individuals (Rom.
   11:25); "the pleroma of the Godhead," i.e., the fulness or plenitude of
   all Divine attributes and energies (Col. 1:19; 2:9); "the pleroma of
   Christ," which is the church as the body of Christ (Eph. 1:23; comp.
   3:19; 4:13).

   In the Gnostic systems, especially that of Valentinus, "pleroma"
   signifies the intellectual and spiritual world, including all Divine
   powers or aeons, in opposition to the "kenoma," i.e., the void, the
   emptiness, the material world. The distinction was based on the
   dualistic principle of an eternal antagonism between spirit and matter,
   which led the more earnest Gnostics to an extravagant asceticism, the
   frivolous ones to wild antinomianism. They included in the pleroma a
   succession of emanations from the Divine abyss, which form the links
   between the infinite and the finite; and they lowered the dignity of
   Christ by making him simply the highest of those intermediate aeons.
   The burden of the Gnostic speculation was always the question: Whence
   is the world? and whence is evil? It sought the solution in a dualism
   between mind and matter, the pleroma and the kenoma; but this is no
   solution at all.

   In opposition to this error, Paul teaches, on a thoroughly monotheistic
   basis, that Christ is "the image of the invisible God" (eikon tou theou
   tou aoratou Col. 1:15; comp. 2 Cor. 4:4--an expression often used by
   Philo as a description of the Logos, and of the personified Wisdom, in
   Wisd. 7:26); that he is the preëxistent and incarnate pleroma or
   plenitude of Divine powers and attributes; that in him the whole
   fulness of the Godhead, that is, of the Divine nature itself, [1157]
   dwells bodily-wise or corporeally (somatikos), as the soul dwells in
   the human body; and that he is the one universal and all-sufficient
   Mediator, through whom the whole universe of things visible and
   invisible, were made, in whom all things hold together (or cohere,
   sunesteken) , and through whom the Father is pleased to reconcile all
   things to himself.

   The Christology of Colossians approaches very closely to the
   Christology of John; for he represents Christ as the incarnate "Logos"
   or Revealer of God, who dwelt among us "full (pleres) of grace and
   truth," and out of whose Divine "fulness" (ek tou pleromatos autou) we
   all have received grace for grace (John 1:1, 14, 16). Paul and John
   fully agree in teaching the eternal preëxistence of Christ, and his
   agency in the creation and preservation of the world (Col. 1:15-17;
   John 1:3). According to Paul, He is "the first-born or first-begotten"
   of all creation (prototokos pases ktiseos,Col. 1:15, distinct from
   protoktistos,first-created), i.e., prior and superior to the whole
   created world, or eternal; according to John He is "the only-begotten
   Son" of the Father. (ho monogenes huios [1158] John 1:14, 18; comp.
   3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9), before and above all created children of God.
   The former term denotes Christ's unique relation to the world, the
   latter his unique relation to the Father.

   The Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Colossians will be
   discussed in the next section in connection with the Epistle to the
   Ephesians.

   Theme: Christ all in all. The true gnosis and the false gnosis. True
   and false asceticism.

   Leading Thoughts: Christ is the image of the invisible God, the
   first-begotten of all creation (Col. 1:15).--In Christ are hidden all
   the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (2:3).--In him dwelleth all the
   fulness (to pleroma) of the Godhead bodily (2:9).--If ye were raised
   together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is,
   seated on the right hand of God (3:1).--When Christ, who is our life,
   shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory
   (3:4).--Christ is all, and in all (3:11).--Above all things put on
   love, which is the bond of perfectness (3:14).--Whatsoever ye do, in
   word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus (3:17).

   [1146] The earthquake took place, according to Tacitus (Ann, XIV. 27),
   in the seventh, according to Eusebius (Chron., Ol.210, 4), in the tenth
   year of Nero's reign, and extended also to Hierapolis and Colossae.

   [1147] In a Greek inscription, published by Boeckh and quoted by
   Lightfoot, Hierapolis is thus apostrophized: "Hail, fairest soil in all
   broad Asia's realm; Hail, golden city, nymph divine, bedeck'd With
   flowing rills, thy jewels."

   [1148] Epictetus ( Epiktetos), a slave and then a freedman of
   Epaphroditus (who was himself a freedman of Nero), was considerably
   younger than Paul, and taught first at Rome, and, after the expulsion
   of the philosophers by Domitian, at Nicopolis in Epirus, where his
   discourses (Enchiridion) were taken down by Arrian. For, like Socrates,
   he himself wrote nothing. A meeting with Paul or Epaphras would " solve
   more than one riddle," as Lightfoot says. But he shows no trace of a
   knowledge of Christianity any more than Seneca, whose correspondence
   with Paul is spurious, though both lived at Rome under Nero. Marcus
   Aurelius, a century later, persecuted the Christians and alludes to
   them only once in his Meditations (XI. 3), where he traces their heroic
   zeal for martyrdom to sheer obstinacy. The self-reliant, stoic morality
   of these philosophers, sublime as it is, would have hindered rather
   than facilitated their acceptance of Christianity, which is based on
   repentance and humility.

   [1149] Kolossai, Colossae, is the correct reading of the oldest MSS.
   against the later Kolassai, Colossae. Herodotus calls it polis megale,
   and Xenophon eudaimon kai megale. In the middle ages it was called
   Chonai. There are few remains of it left two miles north of the present
   town of Chonos, which is inhabited by Christians and Turks.

   [1150] Acts 16:6 (ten Phrugian kai Galatiken choran); 18:23.

   [1151] Col. 2:1; comp. 1:4, 8, 9; and Lightfoot, Com., pp. 23 sqq. and
   238.

   [1152] Col. 1:7; 4:12; comp. Philem 23. Hilgenfeld (p. 663) thinks that
   Paul founded those churches, and uses this as an argument against the
   genuineness of the Epistle which implies the contrary. But how easily
   could a forger have avoided such an apparent contradiction.

   [1153] Col. 4:16: ten ek Laodikaias hina kai humeis a nagnote. An
   abridged expression for "the letter left at Laodicea which you will
   procure thence." So Bleek and Lightfoot, in loco.

   [1154] On the Colossian heresy I refer chiefly to Neander (I. 319
   sqq.), the lectures of Bleek (pp. 11-19), and the valuable Excursus of
   Lightfoot, Com., pp. 73-113, who agrees with Neander and Bleek, but is
   more full. Lightfoot refutes the view of Hilgenfeld (Der Gnosticismus
   u. das N. Test., in the "Zeitschrift für wissensch. Theol.," vol. XIII.
   233 sqq.), who maintains that the Ep. opposes two different heresies,
   pure Gnosticism (Col. 2:8-10) and pure Judaism (2:16-23). Comp. his
   Einleitung, pp. 665 sqq. The two passages are connected by ta stoicheia
   tou kosmou(2:8 and 2:20), and the later history of Gnosticism shows, in
   a more developed form, the same strange mixture of Judaizing and
   paganizing elements. See the chapter on Gnosticism in the second
   volume.

   [1155] The word pleroma, from pleroun, to fill, to complete, occurs
   eighteen times in the New Test., thirteen times in the Epistles of Paul
   (see Bruder). It designates the result of the action implied in the
   verb, i.e., complement, completeness, plenitude, perfection; and, in a
   wider sense (as in John 1:16; Col. 1:19; 2:9), fulness, abundance. Like
   other substantives ending in--ma, it has an active sense: the filling
   substance, that which fills (id quod implet, or id quo res impletur).
   So it is often used by the classics, e.g.,. pleroma poleos,the
   population of a city; in the Septuagint, for the Hebrew 'lm, abundance,
   e g., to pleroma tes ges. or to pleroma tes thalasses, that which fills
   the earth, or the sea; and in the New Test., e.g., Mark 6:43 (kophinon
   pleromata); 8:20 (spuridon pl.). The passive sense is rare: that which
   is filled (id quod impletur or impletum est), the filled receptacle.
   Comp. Grimm and Robinson, sub verbo, and especially Fritzsche, Ad Rom.
   II. 469 sqq., and Lightfoot. Coloss. 323 sqq.

   [1156] In this passage it in equivalent to plerosis, legis observatio.

   [1157] Col2:9 to pleroma tes theotetos , deitas, Deity, not theiotetos,
   divinitas, divinity. Bengel remarks: " Non modo divinae virtutes, sed
   ipsa divina natura." So also Lightfoot.

   [1158] Or, according to the other reading, which is equally well
   supported, monogenes theos , one who is only-begotten God.

   § 95. The Epistle to the Ephesians.

   Contents.

   When Paul took leave of the Ephesian Elders at Miletus, in the spring
   of the year 58, he earnestly and affectionately exhorted them, in view
   of threatening disturbances from within, to take heed unto themselves
   and to feed "the church of the Lord, which he acquired with his own
   blood." [1159]

   This strikes the key-note of the Epistle to the Ephesians. It is a
   doctrinal and practical exposition of the idea of the church, as the
   house of God (Eph. 2:20-22), the spotless bride of Christ (5:25-27),
   the mystical body of Christ (4:12-16), "the fulness of Him that filleth
   all in all" (1:23). The pleroma of the Godhead resides in Christ
   corporeally; so the pleroma of Christ, the plenitude of his graces and
   energies, resides in the church, as his body. Christ's fulness is God's
   fulness; the church's fulness is Christ's fulness. God is reflected in
   Christ, Christ is reflected in the church.

   This is an ideal conception, a celestial vision, as it were, of the
   church in its future state of perfection. Paul himself represents the
   present church militant as a gradual growth unto the complete stature
   of Christ's fulness (4:13-16). We look in vain for an actual church
   which is free from spot or wrinkle or blemish (5:27). Even the
   apostolic church was full of defects, as we may learn from every
   Epistle of the New Testament. The church consists of individual
   Christians, and cannot be complete till they are complete. The body
   grows and matures with its several members. "It is not yet made
   manifest what we shall be" (1 John 3:2).

   Nevertheless, Paul's church is not a speculation or fiction, like
   Plato's Republic or Sir Thomas More's Utopia. It is a reality in
   Christ, who is absolutely holy, and is spiritually and dynamically
   present in his church always, as the soul is present in the members of
   the body. And it sets before us the high standard and aim to be kept
   constantly in view; as Christ exhorts every one individually to be
   perfect, even as our heavenly Father is perfect (Matt. 5:48).

   With this conception of the church is closely connected Paul's profound
   and most fruitful idea of the family. He calls the relation of Christ
   to his church a great mystery (Eph. 5:32), and represents it as the
   archetype of the marriage relation, whereby one man and one woman
   become one flesh. He therefore bases the family on new and holy ground,
   and makes it a miniature of the church, or the household of God.
   Accordingly, husbands are to love their wives even as Christ loved the
   church, his bride, and gave himself up for her; wives are to obey their
   husbands as the church is subject to Christ, the head; parents are to
   love their children as Christ and the church love the individual
   Christians; children are to love their parents as individual Christians
   are to love Christ and the church. The full and general realization of
   this domestic ideal would be heaven on earth. But how few families come
   up to this standard. [1160]

   Ephesians and the Writings of John.

   Paul emphasizes the person of Christ in Colossians, the person and
   agency of the Holy Spirit in Ephesians. For the Holy Spirit carries on
   the work of Christ in the church. Christians are sealed with the Holy
   Spirit of promise unto the day of redemption (Eph. 1:13; 4:30). The
   spirit of wisdom and revelation imparts the knowledge of Christ 1:17;
   3:16. Christians should be filled with the Spirit (5:18), take the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and pray in the Spirit
   at all seasons (6:17, 18).

   The pneumatology of Ephesians resembles that of John, as the
   christology of Colossians resembles the christology of John. It is the
   Spirit who takes out of the "fulness" of Christ, and shows it to the
   believer, who glorifies the Son and guides into the truth (John 14:17;
   15:26; 16:13-15, etc.). Great prominence is given to the Spirit also in
   Romans, Galatians, Corinthians, and the Acts of the Apostles.

   John does not speak of the church and its outward organization (except
   in the Apocalypse), but he brings Christ in as close and vital a
   contact with the individual disciples as Paul with the whole body. Both
   teach the unity of the church as a fact, and as an aim to be realized
   more and more by the effort of Christians, and both put the centre of
   unity in the Holy Spirit.

   Encyclical Intent

   Ephesians was intended not only for the church at Ephesus, the
   metropolis of Asia Minor, but for all the leading churches of that
   district. Hence the omission of the words "in Ephesus" (Eph. 1:1) in
   some of the oldest and best MSS. [1161] Hence, also, the absence of
   personal and local intelligence. The encyclical destination may be
   inferred also from the reference in Col. 4:16 to the Epistle to the
   church of Laodicea, which the Colossians were to procure and to read,
   and which is probably identical with our canonical Epistle to the
   Ephesians." [1162]

   Character and Value of the Epistle.

   Ephesians is the most churchly book of the New Testament. But it
   presupposes Colossians, the most Christly of Paul's Epistles. Its
   churchliness is rooted and grounded in Christliness, and has no sense
   whatever if separated from this root. A church without Christ would be,
   at best, a praying corpse (and there are such churches). Paul was at
   once the highest of high churchmen, the most evangelical of
   evangelicals, and the broadest of the broad, because most comprehensive
   in his grasp and furthest removed from all pedantry and bigotry of sect
   or party. [1163]

   Ephesians is, in some respects, the most profound and difficult (though
   not the most important) of his Epistles. It certainly is the most
   spiritual and devout, composed in an exalted and transcendent state of
   mind, where theology rises into worship, and meditation into oration.
   It is the Epistle of the Heavenlies (ta epourania), a solemn liturgy,
   an ode to Christ and his spotless bride, the Song of Songs in the New
   Testament. The aged apostle soared high above all earthly things to the
   invisible and eternal realities in heaven. From his gloomy confinement
   he ascended for a season to the mount of transfiguration. The prisoner
   of Christ, chained to a heathen soldier, was transformed into a
   conqueror, clad in the panoply of God, and singing a paean of victory.

   The style has a corresponding rhythmical flow and overflow, and sounds
   at times like the swell of a majestic organ. [1164] It is very involved
   and presents unusual combinations, but this is owing to the pressure
   and grandeur of ideas; besides, we must remember that it was written in
   Greek, which admits of long periods and parentheses. In Eph. 1:3-14 we
   have one sentence with no less than seven relative clauses, which rise
   like a thick cloud of incense higher and higher to the very throne of
   God. [1165]

   Luther reckoned Ephesians among "the best and noblest books of the New
   Testament." Witsius characterized it as a divine Epistle glowing with
   the flame of Christian love and the splendor of holy light. Braune
   says: "The exalted significance of the Epistle for all time lies in its
   fundamental idea: the church of Jesus Christ a creation of the Father
   through the Son in the Holy Spirit, decreed from eternity, destined for
   eternity; it is the ethical cosmos; the family of God gathered in the
   world and in history and still further to be gathered, the object of
   his nurture and care in time and in eternity."

   These are Continental judgments. English divines are equally strong in
   praise of this Epistle. Coleridge calls it "the sublimest composition
   of man;" Alford: "the greatest and most heavenly work of one whose very
   imagination is peopled with things in the heavens;" Farrar: "the
   Epistle of the Ascension, the most sublime, the most profound, and the
   most advanced and final utterance of that mystery of the gospel which
   it was given to St. Paul for the first time to proclaim in all its
   fulness to the Gentile world."

   Theme: The church of Christ, the family of God, the fulness of Christ.

   Leading Thoughts: God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the
   world that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love
   (Eph. 1:4). In him we have our redemption through his blood, the
   forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace
   (1:7). He purposed to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the
   heavens, and the things upon the earth (1:10). God gave him to be head
   over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him
   that filleth all in all (1:23). God, being rich in mercy, quickened us
   together with Christ and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with
   him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus (2:4-6). By grace have ye
   been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
   God: not of works, that no man should glory (2:8, 9). Christ is our
   peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition
   (2:14). Ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are
   fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, being
   built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus
   himself being the chief corner stone (2:19, 20). Unto me, who am less
   than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach Unto the
   Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ (3:8). That Christ may dwell
   in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and
   grounded in love, may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what
   is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of
   Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the
   fulness of God (3:17-19). Give diligence to keep the unity of the
   Spirit in the bond of peace (4:3). There is one body, and one Spirit,
   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is
   over all, and through all, and in all (4:6). He gave some to be
   apostles; and some, prophets; and some, pastors and teachers for the
   perfecting of the saints (4:11, 12). Speak the truth in love (4:15).
   Put on the new man, which after God hath been created in righteousness
   and holiness of truth (4:24). Be ye therefore imitators of God, as
   beloved children, and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and
   gave himself up for as, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor
   of a sweet smell (5:1, 2). Wives, be in subjection unto your own
   husbands, as unto the Lord (5:22). Husbands, love your wives, even as
   Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it (5:25). This
   mystery is great; but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church
   (5:32). Children, obey your parents in the Lord (6:1). Put on the whole
   armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
   devil (6:11).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1159] Acts 20:28. Some of the best authorities (', B, Vulg., etc.)
   read "church of God." So also Westcott and Hort, and the English
   Revision; but the American Committee prefers, with Tischendorf, the
   reading tou kuriou, which is supported by A, C*, D, E, etc., and suits
   better in this connection. Paul often speaks of "the church of God,"
   but nowhere of "the blood of God." Possibly, as Dr. Hort suggests,
   huiou may have dropped out in a very early copy after tou idiou. See a
   full discussion by Dr. Abbot, in "Bibl. Sacra" for 1876, pp. 313 sqq.
   (for kuriou), and by Westcott and Hort, Greek Test., II., Notes, pp. 98
   sqq. (for theou).

   [1160] For a fine analysis of the Epistle, I refer to Braune's Com. in
   the Lange Series (translated by Dr. Riddle). He adopts a twofold, Stier
   and Alford a threefold (trinitarian) division. See also Dr. Riddle's
   clear analysis in Schaff's Popular Com. on the New Test., III. (1882).
   p. 355. I. Doctrinal Part, chs. 1-3: The church, the mystical body of
   Christ, chosen, redeemed, and united in Christ. II. Practical Part.
   chs. 4-6: Therefore, let all the members of the church walk in unity,
   in love, in newness of life, in the armor of God. But we should
   remember that the Epistle is not strictly systematic, and the doctrinal
   expositions and practical exhortations interlace each other.

   [1161] en Epheso is omitted in the Sinaitic and Vatican MSS. Marcion
   retained the Epistle under the title "To the Laodicenes," as Tertullian
   reports. Dr. Hort says: "Transcriptional evidence strongly supports the
   testimony of documents against en Epheso." The arguments of Meyer and
   of Woldemar Schmidt (in the fifth ed. of Meyer on Colossians) in favor
   of the words are not conclusive.

   [1162] This was already the view of Marcion in the second century.
   Meyer, however, in loc., insists that another letter is meant, which
   was lost, like one to the Corinthians. The apocryphal Ep. to the
   Laodiceans (in Fabricius, Cod. Apocr. N. T., I. 873 sqq.), consisting
   of twenty verses, is a mere fabrication from the other Epistles of
   Paul. It was forbidden by the Second Council of Nicaea (787).

   [1163] But the very reverse of churchy. Nothing can be further removed
   from the genius of Paul than that narrow, mechanical, and pedantic
   churchiness which sticks to the shell of outward forms and ceremonies,
   and mistakes them for the kernel within.

   [1164] Eph. 5:14 may be a part of a primitive hymn after the type of
   Hebrew parallelism: "Awake thou that sleepest, Arise thou from the dead
   And Christ will shine upon thee."

   [1165] In literal English translation such a sentence is unquestionably
   heavy and cumbrous. Unsympathetic critics, like De Wette, Baur, Renan,
   Holtzmann, characterize the style of Ephesians as verbose, diffuse,
   overloaded, monotonous, and repetitious. But Grotius, a first-class
   classical scholar, describes it (in his Preface) as "rerum sublimitatem
   adaequans verbis sublimioribus quam ulla habuit unquam lingua humana."
   Harless asserts that not a single word in the Epistle is superfluous,
   and has proved it in his very able commentary. Alford (III. 25)
   remarks: "As the wonderful effect of the Spirit of inspiration on the
   mind of man is nowhere in Scripture more evident than in this Epistle,
   so, to discern those things of the Spirit, is the spiritual mind here
   more than anywhere required." He contrasts, under this view, the
   commentaries of De Wette and Stier, putting rather too high an estimate
   on the latter. Maurice (Unity of the N. T., p. 535): "Every one must be
   conscious of an overflowing fulness in the style of this Epistle, as if
   the apostle's mind could not contain the thoughts that were at work in
   him, as if each one that he uttered had a luminous train before it and
   behind it, from which it could not disengage itself." Bishop Ellicott
   says that the difficulties of the first chapter are "so great and so
   deep that the most exact language and the most discriminating analysis
   are too poor and too weak to convey the force or connection of
   expressions so august, and thoughts so unspeakably profound." Dr.
   Riddle: "It is the greatness of the Epistle which makes it so
   difficult; the thought seems to struggle with the words, which seem
   insufficient to convey the transcendent idea."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 96. Colossians and Ephesians Compared and Vindicated.

   Comparison.

   The Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians were written about the
   same time and transmitted through the same messenger, Tychicus. They
   are as closely related to each other as the Epistles to the Galatians
   and to the Romans. They handle the same theme, Christ and his church;
   as Galatians and Romans discuss the same doctrines of salvation by free
   grace and justification by faith.

   But Colossians, like Galatians, arose from a specific emergency, and is
   brief, terse, polemical; while Ephesians, like Romans, is expanded,
   calm, irenical. Colossians is directed against the incipient Gnostic
   (paganizing) heresy, as Galatians is directed against the Judaizing
   heresy. The former is anti-Essenic and anti-ascetic, the latter is
   anti-Pharisaic and anti-legalistic; the one deals with a speculative
   expansion and fantastic evaporation, the latter, with a bigoted
   contraction, of Christianity; yet both these tendencies, like all
   extremes, have points of contact and admit of strange amalgamations;
   and in fact the Colossian and Galatian errorists united in their
   ceremonial observance of circumcision and the Sabbath. Ephesians, like
   Romans, is an independent exposition of the positive truth, of which
   the heresy opposed in the other Epistles is a perversion or caricature.

   Again, Colossians and Ephesians differ from each other in the
   modification and application of their common theme: Colossians is
   christological and represents Christ as the true pleroma or plenitude
   of the Godhead, the totality of divine attributes and powers; Ephesians
   is ecclesiological and exhibits the ideal church as the body of Christ,
   as the reflected pleroma of Christ, "the fulness of Him who filleth all
   in all." Christology naturally precedes ecclesiology in the order of
   the system, as Christ precedes the church; and Colossians preceded
   Ephesians most probably, also in the order of composition, as the
   outline precedes the full picture; but they were not far apart, and
   arose from the same train of meditation. [1166]

   This relationship of resemblance and contrast can be satisfactorily
   explained only on the assumption of the same authorship, the same time
   of composition, and the same group of churches endangered by the same
   heretical modes of thought. With Paul as the author of both everything
   is clear; without that assumption everything is dark and uncertain.
   "Non est cuiusvis hominis," says Erasmus, "Paulinum pectus effingere;
   tonat, fulgurat, meras flammas loquitur Paulus." [1167]

   Authorship.

   The genuineness of the two cognate Epistles has recently been doubted
   and denied, but the negative critics are by no means agreed; some
   surrender Ephesians but retain Colossians, others reverse the case;
   while Baur, always bolder and more consistent than his predecessors,
   rejects both. [1168]

   They must stand or fall together. But they will stand. They represent,
   indeed, an advanced state of christological and ecclesiological
   knowledge in the apostolic age, but they have their roots in the older
   Epistles of Paul, and are brimful of his spirit. They were called forth
   by a new phase of error, and brought out new statements of truth with
   new words and phrases adapted to the case. They contain nothing that
   Paul could not have written consistently with his older Epistles, and
   there is no known pupil of Paul who could have forged such highly
   intellectual and spiritual letters in his name and equalled, if not
   out-Pauled Paul. [1169] The external testimonies are unanimous in favor
   of the Pauline authorship, and go as far back as Justin Martyr,
   Polycarp, Ignatius, and the heretical Marcion (about 140), who included
   both Epistles in his mutilated canon. [1170]

   The difficulties which have been urged against their Pauline origin,
   especially of Ephesians, are as follows:

   1. The striking resemblance of the two Epistles, and the apparent
   repetitiousness and dependence of Ephesians on Colossians, which seem
   to be unworthy of such an original thinker as Paul. [1171] But this
   resemblance, which is more striking in the practical than in the
   doctrinal part, is not the resemblance between an author and an
   imitator, but of two compositions of the same author, written about the
   same time on two closely connected topics; and it is accompanied by an
   equally marked variety in thought and language.

   2. The absence of personal and local references in Ephesians. This is,
   as already remarked, sufficiently explained by the encyclical character
   of that Epistle.

   3. A number of peculiar words not found elsewhere in the Pauline
   Epistles. [1172] But they are admirably adapted to the new ideas, and
   must be expected from a mind so rich as Paul's. Every Epistle contains
   some hapaxlegomena. The only thing which is somewhat startling is that
   an apostle should speak of "holy apostles and prophets" (Eph. 3:5), but
   the term "holy" (hagioi) is applied in the New Testament to all
   Christians, as being consecrated to God (hagiasmenoi, John 17:17), and
   not in the later ecclesiastical sense of a spiritual nobility. It
   implies no contradiction to Eph. 3:8, where the author calls himself
   "the least of all saints" (comp. 1 Cor. 15:9, "I am the least of the
   apostles").

   4. The only argument of any weight is the alleged post-Pauline rise of
   the Gnostic heresy, which is undoubtedly opposed in Colossians (not in
   Ephesians, at least not directly). But why should this heresy not have
   arisen in the apostolic age as well as the Judaizing heresy which
   sprung up before a.d. 50, and followed Paul everywhere? The tares
   spring up almost simultaneously with the wheat. Error is the shadow of
   truth. Simon Magus, the contemporary of Peter, and the Gnostic
   Cerinthus, the contemporary, of John, are certainly historic persons.
   Paul speaks (1 Cor. 8:1) of a "gnosis which puffeth up," and warned the
   Ephesian elders, as early as 58, of the rising of disturbing errorists
   from their own midst; and the Apocalypse, which the Tübingen critics
   assign to the year 68, certainly opposes the antinomian type of
   Gnosticism, the error of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:6, 15, 20), which the
   early Fathers derived from one of the first seven deacons of Jerusalem.
   All the elements of Gnosticism--Ebionism, Platonism, Philoism,
   syncretism, asceticism, antinomianism--were extant before Christ, and
   it needed only a spark of Christian truth to set the inflammable
   material on fire. The universal sentiment of the Fathers, as far as we
   can trace it up to Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, and Polycarp found the
   origin of Gnosticism in the apostolic age, and called Simon Magus its
   father or grandfather.

   Against their testimony, the isolated passage of Hegesippus, so often
   quoted by the negative critics, [1173] has not the weight of a feather.
   This credulous, inaccurate, and narrow-minded Jewish Christian writer
   said, according to Eusebius, that the church enjoyed profound peace,
   and was "a pure and uncorrupted virgin," governed by brothers and
   relations of Jesus, until the age of Trajan, when, after the death of
   the apostles, "the knowledge falsely so called" (pseudonumos
   gnosis,comp. 1 Tim. 6:20), openly raised its head. [1174] But he speaks
   of the church in Palestine, not in Asia Minor; and he was certainly
   mistaken in this dream of an age of absolute purity and peace. The
   Tübingen school itself maintains the very opposite view. Every Epistle,
   as well as the Acts, bears testimony to the profound agitations,
   parties, and evils of the church, including Jerusalem, where the first
   great theological controversy was fought out by the apostles
   themselves. But Hegesippus corrects himself, and makes a distinction
   between the secret working and the open and shameless manifestation of
   heresy. The former began, he intimates, in the apostolic age; the
   latter showed itself afterward. [1175] Gnosticism, like modern
   Rationalism, [1176] had a growth of a hundred years before it came to
   full maturity. A post-apostolic writer would have dealt very
   differently with the fully developed systems of Basilides, Valentinus,
   and Marcion. And yet the two short Epistles to the Colossians and
   Ephesians strike at the roots of this error, and teach the positive
   truth with an originality, vigor, and depth that makes them more
   valuable, even as a refutation, than the five books of Irenaeus against
   Gnosticism, and the ten books of the Philosophumena of Hippolytus; and
   this patent fact is the best proof of their apostolic origin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1166] Lardner, Credner, Mayerhoff, Hofmann, and Reuss reverse the
   order on the ground of Col. 4:16, which refers to "the Epistle from
   Laodicea," assuming that this is the encyclical Epistle to the
   Ephesians. But Paul may have done that by anticipation. On the other
   hand, the kai humeis (that ye also as well as those to whom I have just
   written) in Eph. 6:21, as compared with Col. 4:7, justifies the
   opposite conclusion (as Harless shows, Com., p. lix). Reuss thinks that
   in writing two letters on the same topic the second is apt to be the
   shorter. But the reverse is more frequent, as a second edition of a
   book is usually larger than the first. De Wette, Baur, Hilgenfeld, and
   Holtzmann regard Ephesians as an enlarged recasting (Umarbeitung and
   Ueberarbeitung)of Colossians by a pupil of Paul.

   [1167] Annot. ad Col. 4:16.

   [1168] DeWette first attacked Ephesians as a verbose expansion
   (wortreiche Erweiterung)of the genuine Colossians by a pupil of Paul.
   See his Introd. to the New Test. (1826, 6th ed. by Messner and
   Lünemann, 1860, pp. 313 sqq., and especially his Com. on Eph., 1843 and
   1847). He based his doubts chiefly on the apparent dependence of
   Ephesians on Colossians, and could not appreciate the originality and
   depth of Ephesians. Mayerhoff first attacked Colossians (1838) as a
   post-Pauline abridgment of Ephesians which he regarded as genuine. Baur
   attacked both (1845), as his pupil Schwegler did (1846), and assigned
   them to an anti-Gnostic writer of the later Pauline school. He was
   followed by Hilgenfeld (1870, 1873, and 1875). Hitzig proposed a middle
   view (1870), that a genuine Epistle of Paul to the Colossians was
   enlarged and adapted by the same author who wrote Ephesians, and this
   view was elaborately carried out by Holtzmann with an attempt to
   reconstruct the Pauline original (Kritik der Epheser- und
   Kolosserbriefe, Leipzig, 1872). But the assumption of another Epistle
   of Paul to the Colossians is a pure critical fiction. History knows
   only of one such Epistle. Pfleiderer (1873, Paulinismus, p. 370 sq. and
   434) substantially agrees with Holtzmann, but assumes two different
   authors for the two Epistles. He regards Ephesians as an advance from
   old Paulinism to the Johannean theology. Renan and Ewald admit
   Colossians to be genuine, but surrender Ephesians, assigning it,
   however, to an earlier date than the Tülbingen critics (Ewald to a.d.
   75 or 80). On the other hand, the genuineness of both Epistles has been
   ably defended by Bleek, Meyer, Woldemar Schmidt, Braune, Weiss, Alford,
   Farrar. Bishop Lightfoot, in his Com. on Col., promises to take the
   question of genuineness up in the Com. on Ephes., which, however, has
   not yet appeared. Dr. Samuel Davidson, in the revised edition of his
   Introduction to the Study of the New Test. (1882, vol. II. 176 sqq. and
   205 sqq.), reproduces the objections of the Tübingen critics, and adds
   some new ones which are not very creditable to his judgment, e.g., Paul
   could not warn the Ephesians to steal no more (Eph. 4:28), and not to
   be drunk (5:18), because "the Christians of Asia Minor had no tendency
   to drunken excesses, but rather to ascetic abstinence from wine; and
   the advice given to Timothy might perhaps have been more suitable:
   'Drink a little wine'" (p. 213). But what then becomes of the Epistle
   to the Corinthians who tolerated an incestuous person in their midst
   and disgraced the love feasts by intemperance? What of the Epistle to
   the Romans which contains a similar warning against drunkenness (Rom.
   13:13)? And what could induce a pseudo-Paul to slander the church at
   Ephesus, if it was exceptionally pure?

   [1169] Farrar (II. 602): "We might well be amazed if the first hundred
   years after the death of Christ produced a totally unknown writer who,
   assuming the name of Paul, treats the mystery which it was given him to
   reveal with a masterly power which the apostle himself rarely equalled,
   and most certainly never surpassed. Let any one study the remains of
   the Apostolic Fathers, and he may well be surprised at the facility
   with which writers of the Tübingen school, and their successors, assume
   the existence of Pauls who lived unheard of and died unknown, though
   they were intellectually and spiritually the equals, if not the
   superiors, of St. Paul himself!"

   [1170] See the quotations in Charteris's Canonicity, pp. 237 sqq and
   247 sqq.

   [1171] This is DeWette's chief argument. See his table of parallel
   passages in Einleitung, § 146a (pp. 313-318 of the sixth ed.).

   [1172] Such as aischrologia (Col. 3:8), antanapleroo (1:24), eipeopoieo
   (1:20), ethelothreskeia (2:23), pithanologia (2:4); ta epourania (Eph.
   1:3, 20; 2:6; 3:10; 6:12),ta p'eumatika (6:12), kosmokratores (6:12),
   polupoikilos sophia (3:10). Even the word aphesis (Col. 1:14 and Eph.
   1:7) for paresis (Rom. 3:25) has been counted among the strange terms,
   as if Paul had not known before of the remission of sins. Holtzmann has
   most carefully elaborated the philological argument. But the veteran
   Reuss (I. 112) treats it as futile, and even Davidson must admit (II
   219) that "the sentiments (of Ephesians) are generally Pauline, as well
   as the diction," though he adds that "both betray marks of another
   writer."

   [1173] Baur, Schwegler, and Hilgenfeld (Einleit., 652 sq.).

   [1174] Eus., H. E., III. 32: "The same author [Hegesippus], relating
   the events of the times, also says that 'the church continued until
   then as a pure and uncorrupt virgin (parthenos kathara kai adiaphthoros
   emenen he ekklesia); whilst if there were any at all that attempted to
   pervert the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking
   in darkness (en adelo pou skotei); but when the sacred choir of the
   apostles became extinct, and the generation of those that had been
   privileged to hear their inspired wisdom had passed away, then also
   arose the combination of godless error through the fraud of false
   teachers. These also, as there was none of the apostles left,
   henceforth attempted, without shame (gumne loipon ede te kephale), to
   preach their falsely so-called gnosis against the gospel of truth.'
   Such is the statement of Hegesippus." Comp. the notes on the passage by
   Heinichen in his ed. of Euseb., Tome III., pp. 100-103.

   [1175] The same Hegesippus, in Eus., IV. 22, places the rise of the
   heresies in the Palestinian church immediately after the death of
   James, and traces some of them back to Simon Magus. He was evidently
   familiar with the Pastoral Epistles, and borrowed from them the terms
   pseudonumos gnosis , heterodidaskaloi., hugies kanon.

   [1176] The critical school of Rationalism began in Germany with Semler
   of Halle (1725-1791), in the middle of the eighteenth century, and
   culminated in the Tübingen School of our own age.

   § 97. The Epistle to the Philippians.

   The Church at Philippi.

   Philippi was a city of Macedonia, founded by and called after Philip,
   the father of Alexander the Great, in a fertile region, with contiguous
   gold and silver mines, on the banks of a small river and the highway
   between Asia and Europe, ten miles from the seacoast. It acquired
   immortal fame by the battle between Brutus and Mark Antony (b.c. 42),
   in which the Roman republic died and the empire was born. After that
   event it had the rank of a Roman military colony, with the
   high-sounding title, "Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis." [1177] Hence
   its mixed population, the Greeks, of course, prevailing, next the Roman
   colonists and magistrates, and last a limited number of Jews, who had a
   place of prayer on the riverside. It was visited by Paul, in company
   with Silas, Timothy, and Luke, on his second missionary tour, in the
   year 52, and became the seat of the first Christian congregation on the
   classical soil of Greece. Lydia, the purple dealer of Thyatira and a
   half proselyte to Judaism, a native slave-girl with a divining spirit,
   which was used by her masters as a means of gain among the
   superstitious heathen, and a Roman jailer, were the first converts, and
   fitly represent the three nationalities (Jew, Greek, and Roman) and the
   classes of society which were especially benefited by Christianity. "In
   the history of the gospel at Philippi, as in the history of the church
   at large, is reflected the great maxim of Christianity, the central
   truth of the apostle's teaching, that here is 'neither Jew nor Greek,
   neither bond nor free, neither male nor female, but all are one in
   Christ Jesus.' " [1178] Here, also, are the first recorded instances of
   whole households (of Lydia and the jailer) being baptized and gathered
   into the church, of which the family is the chief nursery. The
   congregation was fully organized, with bishops (presbyters) and deacons
   at the head (Phil. 1:1).

   Here the apostle was severely persecuted and marvellously delivered.
   Here he had his most loyal and devoted converts, who were his "joy and
   crown." For them he felt the strongest personal attachment; from them
   alone he would receive contributions for his support. In the autumn of
   the year 57, after five years' absence, he paid a second visit to
   Philippi, having in the meantime kept up constant intercourse with the
   congregation through living messengers; and on his last journey to
   Jerusalem, in the spring of the following year, he stopped at Philippi
   to keep the paschal feast with his beloved brethren. They had liberally
   contributed out of their poverty to the relief of the churches in
   Judaea. When they heard of his arrival at Rome, they again sent him
   timely assistance through Epaphroditus, who also offered his personal
   services to the prisoner of the Lord, at the sacrifice of his health
   and almost his life. It was through this faithful fellow-worker that
   Paul sent his letter of thanks to the Philippians, hoping, after his
   release, to visit them in person once more.

   The Epistle.

   The Epistle reflects, in familiar ease, his relations to this beloved
   flock, which rested on the love of Christ. It is not systematic, not
   polemic, nor apologetic, but personal and autobiographic, resembling in
   this respect the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, and to some
   extent, also, the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. It is the free
   outflow of tender love and gratitude, and full of joy and cheerfulness
   in the face of life and death. It is like his midnight hymn of praise
   in the dungeon of Philippi. "Rejoice in the Lord alway; again I will
   say, Rejoice" (Phil. 4:4). [1179] This is the key-note of the letter.
   [1180] It proves that a healthy Christian faith, far from depressing
   and saddening the heart, makes truly happy and contented even in
   prison. It is an important contribution to our knowledge of the
   character of the apostle. In acknowledging the gift of the Philippians,
   he gracefully and delicately mingles manly independence and gratitude.
   He had no doctrinal error, nor practical vice to rebuke, as in
   Galatians and Corinthians.

   The only discordant tone is the warning against "the dogs of the
   concision" (katatome, 3:2), as he sarcastically calls the champions of
   circumcision (peritome), who everywhere sowed tares in his wheat
   fields, and at that very time tried to check his usefulness in Rome by
   substituting the righteousness of the law for the righteousness of
   faith. But he guards the readers with equal earnestness against the
   opposite extreme of antinomian license (3:2-21). In opposition to the
   spirit of personal and social rivalry and contention which manifested
   itself among the Philippians, Paul reminds them of the self-denying
   example of Christ, who was the highest of all, and yet became the
   lowliest of all by divesting himself of his divine majesty and humbling
   himself, even to the death on the cross, and who, in reward for his
   obedience, was exalted above every name (2:1-11).

   This is the most important doctrinal passage of the letter, and
   contains (together with 2 Cor. 8:9) the fruitful germ of the
   speculations on the nature and extent of the kenosis, which figures so
   prominently in the history of christology. [1181] It is a striking
   example of the apparently accidental occasion of some of the deepest
   utterances of the apostle. "With passages full of elegant negligence
   (Phil. 1:29), like Plato's dialogues and Cicero's letters, it has
   passages of wonderful eloquence, and proceeds from outward relations
   and special circumstances to wide-reaching thoughts and grand
   conceptions." [1182]

   The objections against the genuineness raised by a few hyper-critical
   are not worthy of a serious refutation. [1183] 184

   The Later History.

   The subsequent history of the church at Philippi is rather
   disappointing, like that of the other apostolic churches in the East.
   It appears again in the letters of Ignatius, who passed through the
   place on his way to his martyrdom in Rome, and was kindly entertained
   and escorted by the brethren, and in the Epistle of Polycarp to the
   Philippians, who expressed his joy that "the sturdy root of their
   faith, famous from the earliest days, still survives and bears fruit
   unto our Lord Jesus Christ," and alludes to the labors of "the blessed
   and glorious Paul" among them. Tertullian appeals to the Philippian
   church as still maintaining the apostle's doctrine and reading his
   Epistle publicly. The name of its bishop is mentioned here and there in
   the records of councils, but that is all. During the middle ages the
   city was turned into a wretched village, and the bishopric into a mere
   shadow. At present there is not even a village on the site, but only a
   caravansary, a mile or more from the ruins, which consist of a theatre,
   broken marble columns, two lofty gateways, and a portion of the city
   wall. [1184] "Of the church which stood foremost among all the
   apostolic communities in faith and love, it may literally be said that
   not one stone stands upon another. Its whole career is a signal
   monument of the inscrutable counsels of God. Born into the world with
   the brightest promise, the church of Philippi has lived without a
   history and perished without a memorial." [1185]

   But in Paul's Epistle that noble little band of Christians still lives
   and blesses the church in distant countries.

   Theme: Theological: The self-humiliation (kenosis) of Christ for our
   salvation (Phil. 2:5-11). Practical: Christian cheerfulness.

   Leading Thoughts: He who began a good work in you will perfect it
   (1:6). If only Christ is preached, I rejoice (1:13). To me to live is
   Christ, and to die is gain (1:21). Have this mind in you, which was
   also in Christ Jesus: who emptied himself, etc. (2:5 sqq.). God worketh
   in you both to will and to work (2:13). Rejoice in the Lord alway;
   again I will say, Rejoice 3:1; 4:1. I count all things to be loss for
   the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (3:8). I press on toward the
   goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (3:14).
   Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever
   things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are
   lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue,
   and if there be any praise, think on these things (4:8). The peace of
   God passeth all understanding (4:7).

   § 98. The Epistle to Philemon.

   Of the many private letters of introduction and recommendation which
   Paul must have written during his long life, only one is left to us,
   very brief but very weighty. It is addressed to Philemon, a zealous
   Christian at Colossae, a convert of Paul and apparently a layman, who
   lent his house for the religious meetings of the brethren. [1186] The
   name recalls the touching mythological legend of the faithful old
   couple, Philemon and Baucis, who, in the same province of Phrygia,
   entertained gods unawares and were rewarded for their simple
   hospitality and conjugal love. The letter was written and transmitted
   at the same time as that to the Colossians. It may be regarded as a
   personal postscript to it.

   It was a letter of recommendation of Onesimus (i.e., Profitable),
   [1187] a slave of Philemon, who had run away from his master on account
   of some offence (probably theft, a very common sin of slaves), [1188]
   fell in with Paul at Rome, of whom he may have heard in the weekly
   meetings at Colossae, or through Epaphras, his fellow-townsman, was
   converted by him to the Christian faith, and now desired to return, as
   a penitent, in company with Tychicus, the bearer of the Epistle to the
   Colossians (Col. 4:9).

   Paul and Slavery.

   The Epistle is purely personal, yet most significant. Paul omits his
   official title, and substitutes the touching designation, "a prisoner
   of Christ Jesus," thereby going directly to the heart of his friend.
   The letter introduces us into a Christian household, consisting of
   father (Philemon), mother (Apphia), son (Archippus, who was at the same
   time a "fellow-soldier," a Christian minister), and a slave (Onesimus).
   It shows the effect of Christianity upon society at a crucial point,
   where heathenism was utterly helpless. It touches on the institution of
   slavery, which lay like an incubus upon the whole heathen world and was
   interwoven with the whole structure of domestic and public life.

   The effect of Christianity upon this gigantic social evil is that of a
   peaceful and gradual care from within, by teaching the common origin
   and equality of men, their common redemption and Christian brotherhood,
   by, emancipating them from slavery unto spiritual freedom, equality,
   and brotherhood in Christ, in whom there is neither Jew nor Greek,
   neither bond nor free, neither male nor female, but all are one moral
   person (Gal. 3:28). This principle and the corresponding practice
   wrought first an amelioration, and ultimately the abolition of slavery.
   The process was very slow and retarded by the counteracting influence
   of the love of gain and power, and all the sinful passions of men; but
   it was sure and is now almost complete throughout the Christian world;
   while paganism and Mohammedanism regard slavery as a normal state of
   society, and hence do not even make an attempt to remove it. It was the
   only wise way for the apostles to follow in dealing with the subject. A
   proclamation of emancipation from them would have been a mere brutum
   fulmen, or, if effectual, would have resulted in a bloody revolution of
   society in which Christianity itself would have been buried.

   Paul accordingly sent back Onesimus to his rightful master, yet under a
   new character, no more a contemptible thief and runaway, but a
   regenerate man and a "beloved brother," with the touching request that
   Philemon might receive him as kindly as he would the apostle himself,
   yea as his own heart (Philem. 16, 17). Such advice took the sting out
   of slavery; the form remained, the thing itself was gone. What a
   contrast! In the eyes of the heathen philosophers (even Aristotle)
   Onesimus, like every other slave, was but a live chattel; in the eyes
   of Paul a redeemed child of God and heir of eternal life, which is far
   better than freedom. [1189]

   The New Testament is silent about the effect of the letter. We cannot
   doubt that Philemon forgave Onesimus and treated him with Christian
   kindness. In all probability he went beyond the letter of the request
   and complied with its spirit, which hints at emancipation. Tradition
   relates that Onesimus received his freedom and became bishop of Beraea
   in Macedonia; sometimes he is confounded with his namesake, a bishop of
   Ephesus in the second century, or made a missionary in Spain and a
   martyr in Rome, or at Puteoli. [1190]

   Paul and Philemon.

   The Epistle is at the same time an invaluable contribution to our
   knowledge of Paul. It reveals him to us as a perfect Christian
   gentleman. It is a model of courtesy, delicacy, and tenderness of
   feeling. Shut up in a prison, the aged apostle had a heart full of love
   and sympathy for a poor runaway slave, made him a freeman in Christ
   Jesus, and recommended him as if he were his own self.

   Paul and Pliny.

   Grotius and other commentators [1191] quote the famous letter of Pliny
   the Consul to his friend Sabinianus in behalf of a runaway slave. It is
   very creditable to Pliny, who was born in the year when Paul arrived as
   a prisoner in Rome, and shows that the natural feelings of kindness and
   generosity could not be extinguished even by that inhuman institution.
   Pliny was a Roman gentleman of high culture and noble instincts,
   although he ignorantly despised Christianity and persecuted its
   innocent professors while Proconsul in Asia. The letters present
   striking points of resemblance: in both, a fugitive slave, guilty, but
   reformed, and desirous to return to duty; in both, a polite, delicate,
   and earnest plea for pardon and restoration, dictated by sentiments of
   disinterested kindness. But they differ as Christian charity differs
   from natural philanthropy, as a Christian gentleman differs from a
   heathen gentleman. The one could appeal only to the amiable temper and
   pride of his friend, the other to the love of Christ and the sense of
   duty and gratitude; the one was concerned for the temporal comfort of
   his client, the other even more for his eternal welfare; the one could
   at best remand him to his former condition as a slave, the other raised
   him to the high dignity of a Christian brother, sitting with his master
   at the same communion table of a common Lord and Saviour. "For polished
   speech the Roman may bear the palm, but for nobleness of tone and
   warmth of heart he falls far short of the imprisoned apostle."

   The Epistle was poorly understood in the ancient church when slavery
   ruled supreme in the Roman empire. A strong prejudice prevailed against
   it in the fourth century, as if it were wholly unworthy of an apostle.
   Jerome, Chrysostom, and other commentators, who themselves had no clear
   idea of its ultimate social bearing, apologized to their readers that
   Paul, instead of teaching metaphysical dogmas and enforcing
   ecclesiastical discipline, should take so much interest in a poor
   runaway slave. [1192] But since the Reformation full justice has been
   done to it. Erasmus says: "Cicero never wrote with greater elegance."
   Luther and Calvin speak of it in high terms, especially Luther, who
   fully appreciated its noble, Christ-like sentiments. Bengel: "mire
   asteios." Ewald: "Nowhere can the sensibility and warmth of a tender
   friendship blend more beautifully with the loftier feeling of a
   commanding spirit than in this letter, at once so brief, and yet so
   surpassingly full and significant." Meyer: "A precious relic of a great
   character, and, viewed merely as a specimen of Attic elegance and
   urbanity, it takes rank among the epistolary masterpieces of
   antiquity." Baur rejects it with trifling arguments as post-apostolic,
   but confesses that it "makes an agreeable impression by its attractive
   form," and breathes "the noblest Christian spirit." [1193] Holtzmann
   calls it "a model of tact, refinement, and amiability." Reuss: "a model
   of tact and humanity, and an expression of a fine appreciation of
   Christian duty, and genial, amiable humor." Renan, with his keen eye on
   the literary and aesthetic merits or defects, praises it as "a
   veritable little f-d'oeuvre, of the art of letter-writing." And
   Lightfoot, while estimating still higher its moral significance on the
   question of slavery, remarks of its literary excellency: "As an
   expression of simple dignity, of refined courtesy, of large sympathy,
   of warm personal affection, the Epistle to Philemon stands unrivalled.
   And its pre-eminence is the more remarkable because in style it is
   exceptionally loose. It owes nothing to the graces of rhetoric; its
   effect is due solely to the spirit of the writer."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1186] A worthless tradition makes him bishop of Colossae and a martyr
   in the Neronian persecution. So Onesimus and almost every important man
   in the apostolic church was turned into a bishop and martyr. On the
   names in the Epistle, see Lightfoot's Com. on Col. and Philem., pp. 372
   sqq.

   [1187] Hence the good-humored play on the meaning of the word, Philem.
   11, achrestos, euchrestos ,"unprofitable to thee, but now profitable to
   thee and to me;" and the play on the name, Philem. 20, onaimen, "let me
   have comfort in thee."

   [1188] Philem. 18 seems to describe the actual offence, though the case
   is stated hypothetically, ei de ti ... opheilei (a mild word for
   eklepsen, stole). The apostle would not wound the feelings of the
   slave, nor irritate the master, and offers himself to discharge the
   debt.

   [1189] "The Gospel," says Lightfoot (p. 389), "never directly attacks
   slavery as an institution: the apostles never command the liberation of
   slaves as an absolute duty. It is a remarkable fact that St. Paul in
   this Epistle stops short of any positive injunction. The word
   'emancipation' seems to be trembling on his lips, and yet he does not
   once utter it. He charges Philemon to take the runaway slave Onesimus
   into his confidence again; to receive him with all affection; to regard
   him no more as a slave, but as a brother; to treat him with the same
   consideration, the same love, which he entertains for the apostle
   himself to whom he owes everything. In fact he tells him to do very
   much more than emancipate his slave, but this one thing he does not
   directly enjoin. St. Paul's treatment of this individual case is an apt
   illustration of the attitude of Christianity toward slavery in
   general."

   [1190] For these conflicting legends, see the Acts Sanctorum Boll.,
   XVI. Febr., II. 857 sqq.

   [1193] "Es wird hier,"he says (Paulus, II. 88, second ed.), "im
   Christenthum die schöne Idee aufgefasst, dass die durch dasselbe mit
   einander Verbundenen in einer wahren Wesensgemeinschaft mit einander
   stehen, so dass der Eine in dem Anderen sein eigenes Selbst erkennt,
   sich mit ihm völlig Eins weiss und einer für alle Ewigkeit dauernden
   Vereinigung angehört."Hilgenfeld admits the genuineness, saying (p.
   331): "Der ganze Brief trägt das Gepräge der einfachen Wahrheit an sich
   und verräth auch in den Wortspielen, Philem. 11, 20, die Schreibart des
   Paulus."

   § 99. The Pastoral Epistles.

   Comp. § 33, pp. 327-329.

   Contents.

   The three Pastoral Epistles, two to Timothy and one to Titus, form a
   group by themselves, and represent the last stage of the apostle's life
   and labors, with his parting counsels to his beloved disciples and
   fellow-workers. They show us the transition of the apostolic church
   from primitive simplicity to a more definite system of doctrine and
   form of government. This is just what we might expect from the probable
   time of their composition after the first Roman captivity of Paul, and
   before the composition of the Apocalypse.

   They are addressed not to congregations, but to individuals, and hence
   more personal and confidential in their character. This fact helps us
   to understand many peculiarities. Timothy, the son of a heathen father
   and a Jewish mother, and Titus, a converted Greek) were among the
   dearest of Paul's pupils. [1194] They were, at the same time, his
   delegates and commissioners on special occasions, and appear under this
   official character in the Epistles, which, for this reason, bear the
   name "Pastoral."

   The Epistles contain Paul's pastoral theology and his theory of church
   government. They give directions for founding, training, and governing
   churches, and for the proper treatment of individual members, old and
   young, widows and virgins, backsliders and heretics. They are rich in
   practical wisdom and full of encouragement, as every pastor knows.

   The Second Epistle to Timothy is more personal in its contents than the
   other two, and has the additional importance of concluding the
   autobiography of Paul. It is his last will and testament to all future
   ministers and soldiers of Christ.

   The Pauline Authorship.

   There never was a serious doubt as to the Pauline authorship of these
   Epistles till the nineteenth century, except among a few Gnostics in
   the second century. They were always reckoned among the Homologumena,
   as distinct from the seven Antilegomena, or disputed books of the New
   Testament. As far as external evidence is concerned, they stand on as
   firm a foundation as any other Epistle. They are quoted as canonical by
   Eusebius, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Irenaeus.
   Reminiscences from them, in some cases with verbal agreement, are found
   in several of the Apostolic Fathers. They are included in the ancient
   MSS. and Versions, and in the list of the Muratorian canon. Marcion
   (about 140), it is true, excluded them from his canon of ten Pauline
   Epistles, but he excluded also the Gospels (except a mutilated Luke),
   the Catholic Epistles, and the Apocalypse. [1195]

   But there are certain internal difficulties which have induced a number
   of modern critics to assign them all, or at least First Timothy, to a
   post-Pauline or pseudo-Pauline writer, who either changed and adapted
   Pauline originals to a later state of the church, or fabricated the
   whole in the interest of Catholic orthodoxy. In either case, the writer
   is credited with the best intentions and must not be judged according
   to the modern standard of literary honesty and literary property.
   Doctrinally, the Pastoral Epistles are made the connecting link between
   genuine Paulinism and the Johannean Logos--philosophy;
   ecclesiastically, the link between primitive Presbyterianism and
   Catholic Episcopacy; in both respects, a necessary element in the
   formation process of the orthodox Catholic church of the second
   century.

   The objections against the Pauline authorship deserve serious
   consideration, and are as follows: (1) The impossibility of locating
   these Epistles in the recorded life of Paul; (2) the Gnostic heresy
   opposed; (3) the ecclesiastical organization implied; (4) the
   peculiarities of style and temper. If they are not genuine, Second
   Timothy must be the oldest, as it is least liable to these objections,
   and First Timothy and Titus are supposed to represent a later
   development. [1196]

   The Time of Composition.

   The chronology of the Pastoral Epistles is uncertain, and has been made
   an objection to their genuineness. It is closely connected with the
   hypothesis of a second Roman captivity, which we have discussed in
   another place.

   The Second Epistle to Timothy, whether genuine or not, hails from a
   Roman prison, and appears to be the last of Paul's Epistles; for he was
   then hourly expecting the close of his fight of faith, and the crown of
   righteousness from his Lord and Master (2 Tim. 4:7, 8). Those who deny
   the second imprisonment, and yet accept Second Timothy as Pauline, make
   it the last of the first imprisonment.

   As to First Timothy and Titus, it is evident from their contents that
   they were written while Paul was free, and after he had made some
   journeys, which are not recorded in the Acts. Here lies the difficulty.
   Two ways are open:

   1. The two Epistles were written in 56 and 57. Paul may, during his
   three years' sojourn in Ephesus, a.d. 54-57 (see Acts 19:8-10; 20:31),
   easily have made a second journey to Macedonia, leaving Ephesus in
   charge of Timothy (1 Tim. 1:3); and also crossed over to the island of
   Crete, where he left Titus behind to take care of the churches (Tit.
   1:5). Considering the incompleteness of the record of Acts, and the
   probable allusions in 2 Cor. 2:1; 12:13, 14, 21; 13:1, to a second
   visit to Corinth, not mentioned in the Acts, these two journeys are
   within the reach of possibility. [1197] But such an early date leaves
   the other difficulties unexplained.

   2. The tradition of the second Roman captivity, which can be raised at
   least to a high degree of probability, removes the difficulty by giving
   us room for new journeys and labors of Paid between his release in the
   spring of 63 and the Neronian persecution in July, 64 (according to
   Tacitus), or three or four years later (according to Eusebius and
   Jerome), as well as for the development of the Gnostic heresy and the
   ecclesiastical organization of the church which is implied in these
   Epistles. Hence, most writers who hold to the genuineness place First
   Timothy and Titus between the first and second Roman captivities.
   [1198]

   Paul certainly intended to make a journey from Rome to Spain (Rom.
   15:24), and also one to the East (Philem. 22; Phil. 1:25, 26; 2:24),
   and he had ample time to carry out his intention even before the
   Neronian persecution, if we insist upon confining this to the date of
   Tacitus. [1199]

   Those who press the chronological difficulty should not forget that a
   forger could have very easily fitted the Epistles into the narrative of
   the Acts, and was not likely to invent a series of journeys,
   circumstances, and incidents, such as the bringing of the cloak, the
   books, and the parchments which Paul, in the hurry of travel, had left
   at Troas (2 Tim. 4:13).

   The Gnostic Heresy.

   The Pastoral Epistles, like Colossians, oppose the Gnostic heresy
   (gnosis pseudonumos,1 Tim. 6:20) which arose in Asia Minor during his
   first Roman captivity, and appears more fully developed in Cerinthus,
   the contemporary of John. This was acknowledged by the early Fathers,
   Irenaeus and Tertullian, who used these very Epistles as Pauline
   testimonies against the Gnosticism of their day.

   The question arises, which of the many types of this many-sided error
   is opposed? Evidently the Judaizing type, which resembled that at
   Colossae, but was more advanced and malignant, and hence is more
   sternly denounced. The heretics were of "the circumcision" (Tit. 1:10);
   they are called "teachers of the law" (nomodidaskaloi,1 Tim. 1:7, the
   very reverse of antinomians), "given to Jewish fables" (Ioudaikoi
   muthoi, Tit. 1:14), and "disputes connected with the law" (machai
   nomikai, Tit. 3:9), and fond of foolish and ignorant questionings (2
   Tim. 2:23). They were, moreover, extravagant ascetics, like the
   Essenes, forbidding to marry and abstaining from meat (1 Tim. 4:3, 8;
   Tit. 1:14, 15). They denied the resurrection and overthrew the faith of
   some (2 Tim. 2:18).

   Baur turned these heretics into anti-Jewish and antinomian Gnostics of
   the school of Marcion (about 140), and then, by consequence, put the
   Epistles down to the middle of the second century. He finds in the
   "genealogies" ( 1 Tim. 1:4; Tit. 3:9) the emanations, of the Gnostic
   aeons, and in the "antitheses" (1 Tim. 6:20), or anti-evangelical
   assertions of the heretical teachers, an allusion to Marcion's
   "antitheses" (antilogies), by which he set forth the supposed
   contradictions between the Old and New Testaments. [1200] But this is a
   radical misinterpretation, and the more recent opponents of the
   genuineness are forced to admit the Judaizing character of those
   errorists; they identify them with Cerinthus, the Ophites, and
   Saturninus, who preceded Marcion by several decades. [1201]

   As to the origin of the Gnostic heresy, which the Tübingen school would
   put down to the age of Hadrian, we have already seen that, like its
   counterpart, the Ebionite heresy, it dates from the apostolic age,
   according to the united testimony of the later Pauline Epistles, the
   Epistles of Peter, John, and Jude, the Apocalypse, and the patristic
   tradition. [1202]

   Ecclesiastical Organization.

   The Pastoral Epistles seem to presuppose a more fully developed
   ecclesiastical organization than the other Pauline Epistles, and to
   belong to an age of transition from apostolic simplicity, or
   Christo-democracy--if we may use such a term--to the episcopal
   hierarchy of the second century. The church, in proportion as it lost,
   after the destruction of Jerusalem, its faith in the speedy advent of
   Christ, began to settle down in this world, and to make preparations
   for a permanent home by a fixed creed and a compact organization, which
   gave it unity and strength against heathen persecution and heretical
   corruption. This organization, at once simple and elastic, was
   episcopacy, with its subordinate offices of the presbyterate and
   deaconate, and charitable institutions for widows and orphans. Such an
   organization we have, it is said, in the Pastoral Epistles, which were
   written in the name of Paul, to give the weight of his authority to the
   incipient hierarchy. [1203]

   But, on closer inspection, there is a very marked difference between
   the ecclesiastical constitution of the Pastoral Epistles and that of
   the second century. There is not a word said about the divine origin of
   episcopacy; not a trace of a congregational episcopate, such as we find
   in the Ignatian epistles, still less of a diocesan episcopate of the
   time of Irenaeus and Tertullian. Bishops and presbyters are still
   identical as they are in the Acts 20:17, 28, and in the undoubtedly
   genuine Epistle to the Philippians 1:1. Even Timothy and Titus appear
   simply as delegates of the apostle for a specific mission. [1204] The
   qualifications and functions required of the bishop are aptness to
   teach and a blameless character; and their authority is made to depend
   upon their moral character rather than their office. They are supposed
   to be married, and to set a good example in governing their own
   household. The ordination which Timothy received (1 Tim. 4:14; 5:22)
   need not differ from the ordination of deacons and elders mentioned in
   Acts 6:6; 8:17; comp. 14:23; 19:6). "Few features," says Dr. Plumptre,
   himself an Episcopalian, "are more striking in these Epistles than the
   absence of any high hierarchical system." The Apocalypse, which these
   very critics so confidently assign to the year 68, shows a nearer
   approach to episcopal unity in the "angels" of the seven churches. But
   even from the "angels," of the Apocalypse there was a long way to the
   Ignatian and pseudo-Clementine bishops, who are set up as living
   oracles and hierarchical idols.

   The Style.

   The language of the Pastoral Epistles shows an unusual number of
   un-Pauline words and phrases, especially rare compounds, some of them
   nowhere found in the whole New Testament, or even in Greek literature.
   [1205]

   But, in the first place, the number of words peculiar to each one of
   the three epistles is much greater than the number of peculiar words
   common to all three; consequently, if the argument proves anything, it
   leads to the conclusion of three different authors, which the
   assailants will not admit, in view of the general unity of the
   Epistles. In the next place, every one of Paul's Epistles has a number
   of peculiar words, even the little Epistle of Philemon. [1206] The most
   characteristic words were required by the nature of the new topics
   handled and the heresy combated, such as "knowledge falsely so called"
   (pseudonumos gnosis, 1 Tim. 6:20) "healthful doctrine" (hugiainousa
   didaskalia, 1 Tim. 1:10); "Jewish myths" (Tit. 1:14); "genealogies"
   (Tit. 3:9); "profane babblings" (2 Tim. 2:16). Paul's mind was
   uncommonly fertile and capable of adapting itself to varying,
   conditions, and had to create in some measure the Christian idiom. The
   Tübingen critics profess the highest admiration for his genius, and yet
   would contract his vocabulary to a very small compass. Finally, the
   peculiarities of style are counterbalanced by stronger resemblances and
   unmistakable evidences of Pauline authorship. "There are flashes of the
   deepest feeling, outbursts of the most intense expression. There is
   rhythmic movement and excellent majesty in the doxologies, and the
   ideal of a Christian pastor drawn not only with an unfaltering hand,
   but with a beauty, fulness, and simplicity which a thousand years of
   subsequent experience have enabled no one to equal, much less to
   surpass." [1207]

   On the other hand, we may well ask the opponents to give a good reason
   why a forger should have chosen so many new words when he might have so
   easily confined himself to the vocabulary of the other Epistles of
   Paul; why he should have added "mercy" to the salutation instead of the
   usual form; why he should have called Paul "the chief of sinners" (1
   Tim. 1:15), and affected a tone of humility rather than a tone of high
   apostolic authority?

   Other Objections.

   The Epistles have been charged with want of logical connection, with
   abruptness, monotony, and repetitiousness, unworthy of such an original
   thinker and writer as Paul. But this feature is only the easy,
   familiar, we may say careless, style which forms the charm as well as
   the defect of personal correspondence. Moreover, every great author
   varies more or less at different periods of life, and under different
   conditions and moods.

   It would be a more serious objection if the theology of these Epistles
   could be made to appear in conflict with that of his acknowledged
   works. [1208] But this is not the case. It is said that greater stress
   is laid on sound doctrine and good works. But in Galatians, Paul
   condemns most solemnly every departure from the genuine gospel (Gal.
   1:8, 9), and in all his Epistles he enjoins holiness as the
   indispensable evidence of faith; while salvation is just as clearly
   traced to divine grace alone, in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim. 1:9;
   Tit. 3:5), as in Romans.

   In conclusion, while we cannot be blind to certain difficulties, and
   may not be able, from want of knowledge of the precise situation of the
   writer, satisfactorily to explain them, we must insist that the
   prevailing evidence is in favor of the genuineness of these Epistles.
   They agree with Paul's doctrinal system; they are illuminated with
   flashes of his genius; they bear the marks of his intense personality;
   they contain rare gems of inspired truth, and most wholesome admonition
   and advice, which makes them to-day far more valuable than any number
   of works on pastoral theology and church government. There are not a
   few passages in them which, for doctrine or practice, are equal to the
   best he ever wrote, and are deeply lodged in the experience and
   affection of Christendom. [1209]

   And what could be a more fitting, as well as more sublime and
   beautiful, finale of such a hero of faith than the last words of his
   last Epistle, written in the very face of martyrdom: "I am already
   being offered, and the time of my departure is come. I have fought the
   good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
   henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the
   Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day: and not only
   to me, but also to all them that have loved his appearing."

   Note.

   Schleiermacher led the way, in 1807, with his attack on 1 Timothy,
   urging very keenly historical, philological, and other objections, but
   assuming 2 Timothy and Titus to be the genuine originals from which the
   first was compiled. DeWette followed in his Introduction. Baur left
   both behind and rejected all, in his epoch-making treatise, Die
   sogenannten Pastoralbriefe, 1835. He was followed by Schwegler (1846),
   Hilgenfeld (1875), Mangold, Schenkel, Hausrath, Pfleiderer (both in his
   Paulinismus and in his Commentary in the Protestanten-Bibel, 1874),
   Holtzmann; also by Ewald, Renan (L'Église chrétienne, pp. 85 sqq.), and
   Sam. Davidson (Introd., revised ed., II. 21 sqq.). The most elaborate
   book against the genuineness is Holtzmann's Die Pastoralbriefe kritisch
   und exeg. behandelt, Leipzig, 1880 (504 pp.); comp. his Einleitung
   (1886).

   Reuss (Les épitres Pauliniennes, 1878, II. 243 sq., 307 sq., and Gesch.
   des N. T, 1887, p. 257 sqq.) rejects 1 Timothy and Titus, but admits 2
   Timothy, assigning it to the first Roman captivity. He thinks that 2
   Timothy would never have been doubted except for its suspicious
   companionship. Some of the opponents, as Pfleiderer and Renan, feel
   forced to admit some scraps of genuine Pauline Epistles or notes, and
   thus they break the force of the opposition. The three Epistles must
   stand or fall together, either as wholly Pauline, or as wholly
   pseudo-Pauline.

   The genuineness has been ably vindicated by Guericke, Thiersch, Huther,
   Wiesinger, Otto, Wieseler, Van Oosterzee, Lange, Herzog, von Hofmann,
   Beck, Alford, Gloag, Fairbairn (Past. Ep., 1874), Farrar (St. Paul, II.
   607 sqq.), Wace (in the Speaker's Com. New Test., III., 1881, 749
   sqq.), Plumptre (in Schaff's Com. on the New Test., III., 1882, pp. 550
   sqq.), Kölling (Der erste Br. a. Tim. 1882), Salmon (1885), and Weiss
   (1886).

   [1195] See the testimonies in Kirchhofer's Quellensammlung, as
   translated and enlarged by Charteris, Canonicity, 255-268. Renan admits
   the resemblance between the First Epistle of Clemens Romanus (c. 44)
   and Second Timothy (e.g., in the use of the word analusis for death),
   but assumes that both borrowed from a common source, the favorite
   language of the church of Rome, and also that the forger of the
   Pastoral Epistles probably made use of some authentic letters of Paul.
   L'Église chrét., p. 95: "Quelques passages de ces trois építres sont
   d'ailleurs si beaux, qu'on peut se demander si le faussaire n'avait pas
   entre les mains quelques billets authentiques de Paul."

   [1196] Baur and Hilgenfeld (Einleit., p. 764) bring them down to 150
   (after Marcion, 140), and date them from Rome. But this is impossible,
   and rests on a false exegesis. Pfleiderer, of the same Tübingen school,
   puts 2 Timothy in the age of Trajan, the other two in the age of
   Hadrian. He, moreover, regards the passages 2 Tim 1:15-18 and 4:9-21 as
   fragments of a genuine Epistle of Paul. Comp. also Holtzmann, p. 271.

   [1197] So Schrader, Wieseler, Reythmayr, formerly also Reuss (in his
   Gesch., etc., 5th ed., 1875, but withdrawn in his French Com. on the

   Bleek, Ruffet, Lange, Farrar, Plumptre, Lightfoot, etc.

   [1199] A release of Paul from the first Roman captivity and a visit to
   Spain is also asserted by such critics as Ewald and Renan.

   [1200] The antitheseis tes pseudonumou gnoseos(" oppositions" in the E.
   V. and Revision) are understood by the best exegetes to mean simply the
   doctrinal theses which the heretics opposed to the sound doctrine
   (comp. 2 Tim. 2:23; Tit. 1:9). So DeWette, Matthies, and Wiesinger.
   Hofmann and Huther identify them with kenophoniai and logomachiai (1
   Tim. 5:4). Holtzmann (p. 131) likewise rejects Baur's interpretation.

   [1201] Holtzmann, l.c., p. 127; also Lipsius, Schenkel, Pfleiderer.

   [1202] See above, § 96 (this vol.)

   [1203] Such is the ingenious reasoning of Baur and Renan (L'Egl.
   chrét., pp. 85 and 94 sqq.). Comp. the discussion of details by
   Holtzmann, l.c., ch. XI., pp. 190 sqq.

   [1204] 1 Tim. 1:3; 3:14; 2 Tim. 4:9, 21; Tit. 1:5; 8:12. See above, §
   61 (this vol.) The fact is acknowledged by impartial episcopal writers,
   as Dean Alford, Bishop Lightfoot, Dean Stanley, and Dean Plumptre (in
   Schaff's Com. N. T., III. 552). I will quote from Canon Farrar (St.
   Paul. II. 417) "If the Pastoral Epistles contained a clear defence of
   the Episcopal system of the second century, this alone would be
   sufficient to prove their spuriousness; but the total absence of
   anything resembling it is one of the strongest proofs that they belong
   to the apostolic age. Bishop and presbyter are still synonymous, as
   they are throughout the New Testament ... Timothy and Titus exercise
   functions which would be now called episcopal; but they are not called
   'bishops.' Their functions were temporary, and they simply act as
   authoritative delegates of the Apostle of the Gentiles. Nor is there
   any trace of exalted pretensions in the overseers whom they appoint.
   The qualifications required of them are almost exclusively moral."
   Comp. also some good remarks of Prof. Wace, in the Speaker's Com. on
   the New Test., III. 764, where it is justly said that the church polity
   in the Pastoral Epistles represents an intermediate stage between the
   Presbyterian episcopacy of the earlier apostolic period and the
   post-apostolic episcopacy.

   [1205] This philological argument was begun by Schleiermacher, but
   confined to First Timothy, and was carried out, with reference to all
   three Epistles, by Holtzmann, l.c., ch. VI., pp. 84-118. I will give
   his results. The Pastoral Epistles have, in all, 897 words. Of these
   there are 169 Hapaxlegomena not found in the New Testament, namely: (a)
   74 in First Timothy, such as agathoergein. hagneia, adelotes,
   andrapodistes , adrophonos, eterodidaskalein, theosebeia, katastole,
   plegma, orismos , philarguria, pseudologos, pseudonumos . (b) 46 in
   Second Timothy, e.g ., agoge, athlein, beltion, membrana, orthotomein,
   pragmateia, philotheos. (c) 28 in Titus, e, g., hairetikos ,
   akatagnostos, aphthoria, apseudes , kalodidaskalos, mataiologos ,
   presbutis, soterios , philagathos, philandros (palingenesia, Tit. 3:5,
   occurs also Matt. 19:28, but in a different sense). (d) 21 common to
   two or three Past. Epp., e g, diabolos, (as adjective), anosios ,
   didaktikos, kenophonia, nomimos , paratheke, genealogia, eusebos.

   [1206] Farrar (II. 611) affirms that there are no less than 111
   peculiar terms in Romans, 180 in Corinthians, 57 in Galatians, 54 in
   Phillipians, 6 in Philemon. Luke's peculiar vocabulary is especially
   rich; he uses, as Holtzmann observes (p. 96), 34 words in common with
   the Pastoral Epistles, and has, besides, 82 words not found in Paul.

   [1207] Farrer, II. 611.

   [1208] Pfleiderer (Protestanten-Bibel. p. 834) says: "Die kirchliche
   Lehrrichtung der Hirtenbriefe ist eine von der altpaulinischen sehr
   weit verschiedene. Von den eigenthümlich paulinischen Lehren über
   Gesetz und Evangelium, über Werke und Glauben finden sich in unseren
   Briefen nur abgeblasste Reste, die fast wie feststehende überliefte
   Formeln klingen, während das Glaubensbewusstsein ein anderes geworden
   ist."In this harsh and unjust judgment the fact is overlooked that the
   three Epistles are pastoral and not doctrinal Epistles.

   [1209] Such passages as 1 Tim. 1:15, 17; 2:1, 4-6, 8; 3:2, 16; 4:1, 4,

   Paulinismus (pp. 324-366), treats of Hebrews, together with Colossians
   and the Epistle of Barnabas, as representing Paulinism under the
   influence of Alexandrinism.

   III. On the introductory questions, comp. Norton in the: "Christian
   Examiner" (Boston), 1827-29; Olshausen: De auctore Ep. ad Hebraeos (in
   Opusc. theol., 1834); Wieseler: Untersuchung über den Hebraeerbrief,
   Kiel, 1861; J. H. Thayer: Authorship and Canonicity of the to the
   Hebrews, in the "Bibliotheca Sacra," Andover, 1867; Zahn, in Herzog's
   "Encykl.," vol. v. (1879), pp. 656-671; and articles in "Bible
   Dictionaries," and in "Encycl. Brit.," 9th ed., vol. xi., 602 sqq.

   The anonymous Epistle "to the Hebrews," like the Book of Job, belongs
   to the order of Melchizedek, combining priestly unction and royal
   dignity, but being "without father, without mother, without pedigree,
   having neither beginning of days nor end of life" (Heb. 7:1-3). Obscure
   in its origin, it is clear and deep in its knowledge of Christ. Hailing
   from the second generation of Christians (2:3), it is full of
   pentecostal inspiration. Traceable to no apostle, it teaches, exhorts,
   and warns with apostolic authority and power. Though not of Paul's pen,
   it has, somehow, the impress of his genius and influence, and is
   altogether worthy to occupy a place in the canon, after his Epistles,
   or between them and the Catholic Epistles. Pauline in spirit, it is
   catholic or encyclical in its aim. [1210]

   Contents.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews is not an ordinary letter. It has, indeed,
   the direct personal appeals, closing messages, and salutations of a
   letter; but it is more, it is a homily, or rather a theological
   discourse, aiming to strengthen the readers in their Christian faith,
   and to protect them against the danger of apostasy from Christianity.
   It is a profound argument for the superiority of Christ over the
   angels, over Moses, and over the Levitical priesthood, and for the
   finality of the second covenant. It unfolds far more fully than any
   other book the great idea of the eternal priesthood and sacrifice of
   Christ, offered once and forever for the redemption of the world, as
   distinct from the national and transient character of the Mosaic
   priesthood and the ever-repeated sacrifices of the Tabernacle and the
   Temple. The author draws his arguments from the Old Testament itself,
   showing that, by its whole character and express declarations, it is a
   preparatory dispensation for the gospel salvation, a significant type
   and prophecy of Christianity, and hence destined to pass away like a
   transient shadow of the abiding substance. He implies that the Mosaic
   oeconomy was still existing, with its priests and daily sacrifices, but
   in process of decay, and looks forward to the fearful judgment which a
   few years, afterward destroyed the Temple forever. [1211] He
   interweaves pathetic admonitions and precious consolations with
   doctrinal expositions, and every exhortation leads him to a new
   exposition. Paul puts the hortatory part usually at the end.

   The author undoubtedly belonged to the Pauline school, which emphasized
   the great distinction between the Old and the New Covenant; while yet
   fully acknowledging the divine origin and paedagogic use of the former.
   But he brings out the superiority of Christ's priesthood and sacrifice
   to the Mosaic priesthood and sacrifice; while Paul dwells mainly on the
   distinction between the law and the gospel. He lays chief stress on
   faith, but he presents it in its general aspect as trust in God, in its
   prospective reference to the future and invisible, and in its
   connection with hope and perseverance under suffering; while Paul
   describes faith, in its specific evangelical character, as a hearty
   trust in Christ and his atoning merits, and in its justifying effect,
   in opposition to legalistic reliance on works. Faith is defined, or at
   least described, as "assurance (hupostasis) of things hoped for, a
   conviction (elenchos) of things not seen" (11:1). This applies to the
   Old Testament as well as the New, and hence appropriately opens the
   catalogue of patriarchs and prophets, who encourage Christian believers
   in their conflict; but they are to look still more to Jesus as "the
   author and perfecter of our faith" (12:2), who is, after all, the
   unchanging object of our faith, "the same yesterday, and to-day, and
   for ever" (13:8).

   The Epistle is eminently Christological. It resembles in this respect
   Colossians and Philippians, and forms a stepping-stone to the
   Christology of John. From the sublime description of the exaltation and
   majesty of Christ in Heb. 1:1-4 (comp. Col. 1:15-20), there is only one
   step to the prologue of the fourth Gospel. The exposition of the high
   priesthood of Christ reminds one of the sacerdotal prayer (John 17).

   The use of proof-texts from the Old Testament seems at times contrary
   to the obvious historical import of the passage, but is always
   ingenious, and was, no doubt, convincing to Jewish readers. The writer
   does not distinguish between typical and direct prophecies. He
   recognizes the typical, or rather antitypical, character of the
   Tabernacle and its services, as reflecting the archetype seen by Moses
   in the mount, but all the Messianic prophecies are explained as direct
   (Heb. 1:5-14; 2:11-13; 10:5-10). He betrays throughout a high order of
   Greek culture, profound knowledge of the Greek Scriptures, and the
   symbolical import of the Mosaic worship. [1212] He was also familiar
   with the Alexandrian theosophy of Philo, [1213] but he never introduces
   foreign ideas into the Scriptures, as Philo did by his allegorical
   interpretation. His exhortations and warnings go to the quick of the
   moral sensibility; and yet his tone is also cheering and encouraging.
   He had the charisma of exhortation and consolation in the highest
   degree. [1214] Altogether, he was a man full of faith and the Holy
   Spirit, and gifted with a tongue of fire.

   The Style.

   Hebrews is written in purer Greek than any book of the New Testament,
   except those portions of Luke where he is independent of prior
   documents. The Epistle begins, like the third Gospel, with a rich and
   elegant period of classic construction. The description of the heroes
   of faith in the eleventh chapter is one of the most eloquent and
   sublime in the entire history of religious literature. He often reasons
   a minori ad majus (ei ... poso mallon). He uses a number of rare and
   choice terms which occur nowhere else in the New Testament. [1215]

   As compared with the undoubted Epistles of Paul, the style of Hebrews
   is less fiery and forcible, but smoother, more correct, rhetorical,
   rhythmical, and free from anacolutha and solecisms. There is not that
   rush and vehemence which bursts through ordinary rules, but a calm and
   regular flow of speech. The sentences are skilfully constructed and
   well rounded. Paul is bent exclusively on the thought; the author of
   Hebrews evidently paid great attention to the form. Though not strictly
   classical, his style is as pure as the Hellenistic dialect and the
   close affinity with the Septuagint permit.

   All these considerations exclude the idea of a translation from a
   supposed Hebrew original.

   The Readers.

   The Epistle is addressed to the Hebrew Christians, that is, according
   to the usual distinction between Hebrews and Hellenists (Acts 6:1;
   9:27), to the converted Jews in Palestine, chiefly to those in
   Jerusalem. To them it is especially adapted. They lived in sight of the
   Temple, and were exposed to the persecution of the hierarchy and the
   temptation of apostasy. This has been the prevailing view from the time
   of Chrysostom to Bleek. [1216] The objection that the Epistle quotes
   the Old Testament uniformly after the Septuagint is not conclusive,
   since the Septuagint was undoubtedly used in Palestine alongside with
   the Hebrew original.

   Other views more or less improbable need only be mentioned: (1) All the
   Christian Jews as distinct from the Gentiles; [1217] (2) the Jews of
   Jerusalem alone; [1218] (3) the Jews of Alexandria; [1219] (4) the Jews
   of Antioch; [1220] (5) the Jews of Rome; [1221] (6) some community of
   the dispersion in the East (but not Jerusalem). [1222]

   Occasion and Aim.

   The Epistle was prompted by the desire to strengthen and comfort the
   readers in their trials and persecutions (Heb. 10:32-39; Heb. 11 and
   12), but especially to warn them against the danger of apostasy to
   Judaism (2:2, 3; 3:6, 14; 4:1, 14; 6:1-8; 10:23, 26-31). And this could
   be done best by showing the infinite superiority of Christianity, and
   the awful guilt of neglecting so great a salvation.

   Strange that but thirty years after the resurrection and the
   pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, there should have been such a
   danger of apostasy in the very mother church of Christendom. And yet
   not strange, if we realize the condition of things, between 60 and 70.
   The Christians in Jerusalem were the most conservative of all
   believers, and adhered as closely as possible to the traditions of
   their fathers. They were contented with the elementary doctrines, and
   needed to be pressed on "unto perfection" (5:12; 6:1-4). The Epistle of
   James represents their doctrinal stand-point. The strange advice which
   he gave to his brother Paul, on his last visit, reflects their timidity
   and narrowness. Although numbered by "myriads," they made no attempt in
   that critical moment to rescue the great apostle from the hands of the
   fanatical Jews; they were "all zealous for the law," and afraid of the
   radicalism of Paul on hearing that he was teaching the Jews of the
   Dispersion "to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their
   children, neither to walk after the customs" ( Acts 21:20, 21).

   They hoped against hope for the conversion of their people. When that
   hope vanished more and more, when some of their teachers had suffered
   martyrdom (Heb. 13:7), when James, their revered leader, was stoned by
   the Jews (62), and when the patriotic movement for the deliverance of
   Palestine from the hated yoke of the heathen Romans rose higher and
   higher, till it burst out at last in open rebellion (66), it was very
   natural that those timid Christians should feel strongly tempted to
   apostatize from the poor, persecuted sect to the national religion,
   which they at heart still believed to be the best part of Christianity.
   The solemn services of the Temple, the ritual pomp and splendor of the
   Aaronic priesthood, the daily sacrifices, and all the sacred
   associations of the past had still a great charm for them, and allured
   them to their embrace. The danger was very strong, and the warning of
   the Epistle fearfully solemn.

   Similar dangers have occurred again and again in critical periods of
   history.

   Time and Place of Composition.

   The Epistle hails and sends greetings from some place in Italy, at a
   time when Timothy, Paul's disciple, was set at liberty, and the writer
   was on the point of paying, with Timothy, a visit to his readers
   (13:23, 24). The passage, "Remember them that are in bonds, as bound
   with them" (13:3), does not necessarily imply that he himself was in
   prison, indeed 13:23 seems to imply his freedom. These notices
   naturally suggest the close of Paul's first Roman imprisonment, in the
   spring of the year 63, or soon after; for Timothy and Luke were with
   him there, and the writer himself evidently belonged to the circle of
   his friends and fellow-workers.

   There is further internal evidence that the letter was written before
   the destruction of Jerusalem (70), before the outbreak of the Jewish
   war (66), before the Neronian persecution (in July, 64), and before
   Paul's martyrdom. None of these important events are even alluded to;
   [1223] on the contrary, as already remarked, the Temple was still
   standing, with its daily sacrifices regularly going on, and the doom of
   the theocracy was still in the future, though "nigh unto a curse,"
   "becoming old and ready to vanish away;" it was "shaken" and about to
   be removed; the day of the fearful judgment was drawing nigh. [1224]

   The place of composition was either Rome or some place in Southern
   Italy, if we assume that the writer had already started on his journey
   to the East. [1225] Others assign it to Alexandria, or Antioch, or
   Ephesus. [1226]

   Authorship.

   This is still a matter of dispute, and will probably never be decided
   with absolute certainty. The obscurity of its origin is the reason why
   the Epistle to the Hebrews was ranked among the seven Antilegomena of
   the ante-Nicene church. The controversy ceased after the adoption of
   the traditional canon in 397, but revived again at the time of the
   Reformation. The different theories may be arranged under three heads:
   (1) sole authorship of Paul; (2) sole authorship of one of his pupils;
   (3) joint authorship of Paul and one of his pupils. Among the pupils
   again the views are subdivided between Luke, Barnabas, Clement of Rome,
   Silvanus, and Apollos. [1227]

   1. The Pauline Authorship was the prevailing opinion of the church from
   the fourth century to the eighteenth, with the exception of the
   Reformers, and was once almost an article of faith, but has now very
   few defenders among scholars. [1228] It rests on the following
   arguments:

   (a) The unanimous tradition of the Eastern church, to which the letter
   was in all probability directed; yet with the important qualification
   which weakens the force of this testimony, that there was a widely
   prevailing perception of a difference of style, and consequent
   supposition of a Hebrew original, of which there is no historic basis
   whatever. Clement of Alexandria ascribed the Greek composition to Luke.
   [1229] Origen observes the greater purity of the Greek style, [1230]
   and mentions Luke and Clement, besides Paul, as possible authors, but
   confesses his own ignorance. [1231]

   (b) The mention of Timothy and the reference to a release from
   captivity (Heb. 13:23) point to Paul. Not necessarily, but only to the
   circle of Paul. The alleged reference to Paul's own captivity in 10:34
   rests on a false reading (desmois mou, E. V., "in my bonds," instead of
   the one now generally adopted, tois desmiois, "those that were in
   bonds"). Nor does the request 13:18, 19, imply that the writer was a
   prisoner at the time of composition; for 13:23 rather points to his
   freedom, as he expected, shortly to see his readers in company with
   Timothy.

   (c) The agreement of the Epistle with Paul's system of doctrine, the
   tone of apostolic authority, and the depth and unction which raises the
   Epistle to a par with his genuine writings. But all that can be said in
   praise of this wonderful Epistle at best proves only its inspiration
   and canonicity, which must be extended beyond the circle of the
   apostles so as to embrace the writings of Luke, Mark, James, and Jude.

   2. The Non-Pauline Authorship is supported by the following arguments:

   (a) The Western tradition, both Roman and North African, down to the
   time of Augustin, is decidedly against the Pauline authorship. This has
   all the more weight from the fact that the earliest traces of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews are found in the Roman church, where it was
   known before the close of the first century. Clement of Rome makes very
   extensive use of it, but nowhere under the name of Paul. The Muratorian
   Canon enumerates only thirteen Epistles of Paul and omits Hebrews. So
   does Gaius, a Roman presbyter, at the beginning of the third century.
   Tertullian ascribed the Epistle to Barnabas. According to the testimony
   of Eusebius, the Roman church did not regard the Epistle as Pauline at
   his day (he died 340). Philastrius of Brescia (d. about 387) mentions
   that some denied the Pauline authorship, because the passage 6:4-6
   favored the heresy and excessive disciplinary rigor of the Novatians,
   but he himself believed it to be Paul's, and so did Ambrose of Milan.
   Jerome (d. 419) can be quoted on both sides. He wavered in his own
   view, but expressly says: "The Latin custom (Latina consuetudo) does
   not receive it among the canonical Scriptures;" and in another place:
   "All the Greeks receive the Epistle to the Hebrews, and some Latins (et
   nonnulli Latinorum)." Augustin, a profound divine, but neither linguist
   nor critic, likewise wavered, but leaned strongly toward the Pauline
   origin. The prevailing opinion in the West ascribed only thirteen
   Epistles to Paul. The Synod of Hippo (393) and the third Synod of
   Carthage (397), under the commanding influence of Augustin, marked a
   transition of opinion in favor of fourteen. [1232] This opinion
   prevailed until Erasmus and the Reformers revived the doubts of the
   early Fathers. The Council of Trent sanctioned it.

   (b) The absence of the customary name and salutation. This has been
   explained from modesty, as Paul was sent to the Gentiles rather than
   the Jews (Pantaenus), or from prudence and the desire to secure a
   better hearing from Jews who were strongly prejudiced against Paul
   (Clement of Alexandria). Very unsatisfactory and set aside by the
   authoritative tone of the Epistle.

   (c) In 2:3 the writer expressly distinguishes himself from the
   apostles, and reckons himself with the second generation of Christians,
   to whom the word of the Lord was "confirmed by them that heard" it at
   the first from the Lord. Paul, on the contrary, puts himself on a par
   with the other apostles, and derives his doctrine directly from Christ,
   without any human intervention (Gal. 1:1, 12, 15, 16). This passage
   alone is conclusive, and decided Luther, Calvin, and Beza against the
   Pauline authorship. [1233]

   (d) The difference, not in the substance, but in the form and method of
   teaching and arguing. [1234]

   (e) The difference of style (which has already been discussed). This
   argument does not rest on the number of peculiar words for such are
   found in every book of the New Testament, but in the superior purity,
   correctness, and rhetorical finish of style.

   (f) The difference in the quotations from the Old Testament. The author
   of Hebrews follows uniformly the Septuagint, even with its departures
   from the Hebrew; while Paul is more independent, and often corrects the
   Septuagint from the Hebrew. Bleek has also discovered the important
   fact that the former used the text of Codex Alexandrinus, the latter
   the text of Codex Vaticanus. [1235] It is incredible that Paul, writing
   to the church of Jerusalem, should not have made use of his Hebrew and
   rabbinical learning in quoting the Scriptures.

   3 Conjectures concerning the probable author. Four Pauline disciples
   and co-workers have been proposed, either as sole or as joint authors
   with Paul, three with some support in tradition--Barnabas, Luke, and
   Clement--one without any Apollos. Silvanus also has a few advocates.
   [1236]

   (a) Barnabas. [1237] He has in his favor the tradition of the African
   church (at least Tertullian), his Levitical training, his intimacy with
   Paul, his close relation to the church in Jerusalem, and his almost
   apostolic authority. As the huios parakleseos(Acts 4:36), he may have
   written the logos parakleseos(Heb. 13:22). But in this case he cannot
   be the author of the Epistle which goes by his name, and which,
   although belonging to the Pauline and strongly anti-Judaizing tendency,
   is yet far inferior to Hebrews in spirit and wisdom. Moreover, Barnabas
   was a primitive disciple, and cannot be included in the second
   generation (2:3).

   (b) Luke. [1238] He answers the description of 2:3, writes pure Greek,
   and has many affinities in style. [1239] But against him is the fact
   that the author of Hebrews was, no doubt, a native Jew, while Luke was
   a Gentile (Col. 4:11, 14). This objection, however, ceases in a measure
   if Luke wrote in the name and under the instruction of Paul.

   (c) Clemens Romanus. [1240] He makes thorough use of Hebrews and
   interweaves passages from the Epistle with his own ideas, but evidently
   as an imitator, far inferior in originality and force.

   (d) Apollos. [1241] A happy guess of the genius of Luther, suggested by
   the description given of Apollos in the Acts 18:24-28, and by Paul (1
   Cor. 1:12; 3:4-6, 22; 4:6; 16:12; Tit. 3:13). Apollos was a Jew of
   Alexandria, mighty in the Scriptures, fervent in spirit, eloquent in
   speech, powerfully confuting the Jews, a friend of Paul, and
   independently working with him in the same cause at Ephesus, Corinth,
   Crete. So far everything seems to fit. But this hypothesis has not a
   shadow of support in tradition, which could hardly have omitted Apollos
   in silence among the three or four probable authors. Clement names him
   once, [1242] but not as the author of the Epistle which he so freely
   uses. Nor is there any trace of his ever having been in Rome, and
   having stood in so close a relationship to the Hebrew Christians in
   Palestine.

   The learned discussion of modern divines has led to no certain and
   unanimous conclusion, but is, nevertheless, very valuable, and sheds
   light in different directions. The following points may be regarded as
   made certain, or at least in the highest degree probable: the author of
   Hebrews was a Jew by birth; a Hellenist, not a Palestinian; thoroughly
   at home in the Greek Scriptures (less so, if at all, in the Hebrew
   original); familiar with the Alexandrian Jewish theology (less so, if
   at all, with the rabbinical learning of Palestine); a pupil of the
   apostles (not himself an apostle); an independent disciple and coworker
   of Paul; a friend of Timothy; in close relation with the Hebrew
   Christians of Palestine, and, when he wrote, on the point of visiting
   them; an inspired man of apostolic insight, power, and authority, and
   hence worthy of a position in the canon as "the great unknown."

   Beyond these marks we cannot go with safety. The writer purposely
   withholds his name. The arguments for Barnabas, Luke, and Apollos, as
   well as the objections against them, are equally strong, and we have no
   data to decide between them, not to mention other less known workers of
   the apostolic age. We must still confess with Origen that God only
   knows the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   Notes.

   I.--The Position of Hebrews in the New Testament. In the old Greek MSS.
   (', B, C, D) the Epistle to the Hebrews stands before the Pastoral
   Epistles, as being an acknowledged letter of Paul. This order has,
   perhaps, a chronological value, and is followed in the critical
   editions Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort), although
   Westcott and Hort regard the Pastoral Epistles as Pauline, and the Ep.
   to the Hebrews as un-Pauline. See their Gr. Test., vol. II., 321.

   But in the Latin and English Bibles, Hebrews stands more appropriately
   at the close of the Pauline Epistles, and immediately precedes the
   Catholic Epistles.

   Luther, who had some doctrinal objections to Hebrews and James, took
   the liberty of putting them after the Epistles of Peter and John, and
   making them the last Epistles except Jude. He misunderstood Heb. 6:4-6;
   10:26, 27; 12:17, as excluding the possibility of a second repentance
   and pardon after baptism, and called these passages, "hard knots" that
   ran counter to all the Gospels and Epistles of Paul; but, apart from
   this, he declared Hebrews to be, "an Epistle of exquisite beauty,
   discussing from Scripture, with masterly skill and thoroughness, the
   priesthood of Christ, and interpreting on this point the Old Testament
   with great richness and acuteness."

   The English Revisers retained, without any documentary evidence, the
   traditional title, "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews."
   This gives sanction to a particular theory, and is properly objected to
   by the American Revisers. The Pauline authorship is, to say the least,
   an open question, and should have been left open by the Revisers. The
   ancient authorities entitle the letter simply, Pros Hebraious,and even
   this was probably added by the hand of an early transcriber. Still less
   is the subscription, "Written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy" to
   be relied on as original, and was probably a mere inference from the
   contents (Heb. 13:23, 24).

   II.--The Hapaxtegomena of the Epistle. agenealogetos,without pedigree
   (said of Melchizedek), Heb. 7:3. ametor, motherless, 7:3. apator,
   fatherless, 7:3. apaugasma,effulgence (said of Christ in relation to
   God), 1:2. aistheterion, sense, 5:14. akrothinion, spoils, 7:4.
   euperistatos(from euand periistemi,to place round), a difficult word of
   uncertain interpretation, easily besetting, closely clinging to (E. R.
   on the margin: admired by many), 12:1. kritikos,quick to discern, 4:12.
   he mellousa oikoumene, the future world, 2:5. mesiteuein, to interpose
   one's self, to mediate, 6:17., metriopathein, to have compassion on, to
   bear gently with, 5:2 (said of Christ). horkomosia, oath, 7:20, 21, 28.
   parapikrainein, to provoke, 3:16. parapikrasmos,provocation, 3:8, 15.
   polumeros,by divers portions, 1:1. polutropos,in divers manners, 1:1.
   prodromos,forerunner, 6:20 (of Christ). sunepimarturein, to bear
   witness with, 2:4. trachelizein. to open, 4:13 (tetrachelismena, laid
   open). hupostasis,substance (or person), 1:3 (of God); confidence,
   3:14; assurance, 11:1. This word, however, occurs also in 2 Cor. 11:17,
   in the sense of confidence. charakter, express image (Christ, the very
   image of the essence of God), Heb. 1:3.

   On the other hand, the Ep. to the Hebrews has a number of rare words in
   common with Paul which are not elsewhere found in the New Testament or
   the Septuagint, as aidos(12:13; 1 Tim. 2:9), anatheoreo(Heb. 13:7; Acts
   17:23), anupotaktos(Heb.2:8; 1 Tim. 1:9; Tit. 1:6, 10), apeitheia(Heb.
   4:6, 11; Rom. 11:30, 32; Eph. 2:2; Col. 3:5), apolousis(Heb. 11:25; 1
   Tim. 6:17), aphilarguros(Heb. 13:5; 1 Tim. 3:3), endikos(Heb. 2:1; Rom.
   3:8), energes(Heb. 4:12; 1 Cor. 16:9; Philem. 6),ephapax(Heb. 7:27;
   10:10; Rom. 9:10; 1 Cor. 15:6), kosmikos(Heb. 9:11; Tit. 2:12),
   mimetes(Heb. 6:12; 1 Cor. 4:16, etc.), nekroo (Heb. 11:12; Rom. 4:19;
   Col. 3:5), oregomai (Heb. 11:16; 1 Tim. 3:1; 6:10), parakoe(Heb. 2:2;
   Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 10:6), plerophoria(Heb. 6:11; 10:22; Col. 2:2; 1
   Thess. 1:5), philoxenia(Heb. 13:2; Rom. 12:13).

   On the linguistic peculiarities of Hebrews, see Bleek, I. 315-338
   Lünemann, Com., pp. 12 and 24 sqq. (4th ed., 1878); Davidson, Introd.,
   I. 209 sqq. (revised ed., 1882); and the Speaker's Com. N. T., IV.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [1210] See notes at the end of the section.

   [1211] Heb. 9:8, "while as the first tabernacle is yet standing" (tes
   protes skenes echouses stasin); 9:6, "the priests go in continually"
   (eisiasin, not went in, as in the E. V.); 8:4; 13:10; 6:8; 8:13; 10:25,
   27; 12:27. Those who assign the composition to a time after the
   destruction of Jerusalem, deprive the present tenses of their natural
   import and proper effect.

   [1212] The charge of partial ignorance of the Jewish ritual is
   unfounded, and can therefore not be made an argument either for or
   against the Pauline authorship. In the genuine text of Heb. 10:11, the
   high priest is not mentioned, but the priest (hiereus), and in 7:27 the
   high priest is not asserted to offer daily sacrifice, but to need daily
   repentance. The altar of incense is placed in the holy of holies, 9:4;
   but this seems to have been a current opinion, which is also mentioned
   in the Apocalypse of Baruch. See Harnack in "Studien und Kritiken" for
   1876, p. 572, and W. R. Smith in " Enc. Brit.," xi., 606.

   [1213] See Carpzov, Sacrae Exercitationes in Ep. ad Heb. ex Philone
   Alex. (Helmstadii, 1750); Riehm, l.c., pp. 9 sqq.; Hilgenfeld,
   Einleit., p. 384; and Pfleiderer, Paulinismus.

   [1214] The Epistle is called a logos parakleseos , Heb. 13:22; comp.
   12:5; 6:18

   [1215] See note II. at the close.

   [1216] So also DeWette, Tholuck, Thiersch, Delitzsch, Lünemann, Riehm,
   Moll (in Lange's Com.), Langen, Weiss.

   [1217] So Oecumenius, Lightfoot, Lange; also Grimm (sub verbo): "Omnes
   de Judaeis sive aramaice sive graece loquentibus Christiani."

   [1218] Ebrard. Moulton, on the contrary, thinks that some other church
   in Palestine is addressed, and that Jerusalem is excluded by Heb. 2:3.

   [1219] Wieseler (who adds an unlikely reference to the temple of Onias
   in Leontopolis), Credner, Baur, Hilgenfeld, Köstlin, Reuss, Bunsen,
   Conybeare and Howson, and Plumptre.

   [1220] Von Hofmann.

   [1221] Wetstein, Alford, Holtzmann, Kurtz, Zahn; also Renan, who thinks
   (L'Antechrist. p. 211) that the Ep. was written by Barnabas in Ephesus,
   and addressed to the church in Rome; hence it was first known in Rome.

   [1222] A. B. Davidson (Ep. to the Hebr., 1882, p. 18).

   [1223] Zahn refers Heb. 10:32-34 to the Neronian persecution; but this
   is excluded by 12:4, "Ye have not yet resisted unto blood" (mechri
   ahimatos). Harnack finds also traces of the Domitian persecution. Still
   more unlikely.

   [1224] Lardner, Thiersch, Lindsay, Bullock (in Smith's B. Dict., Am.
   ed., II., 1028), and others, assign the Epistle to a.d. 63; DeWette,
   Moll, and Lange to between 62 and 66 (between the death of James and
   the outbreak of the Jewish war); Ebrard to 62; Wieseler (Chronol, des
   Ap. Zeitalters, p. 519) to July, 64; Stuart and Tholuck to about 64;
   Weiss to 65 ("bald nach der Mitte der sechziger Jahre"); Hilgenfeld to
   between 64 and 66; Davidson (Introd., revised ed., I. 222) to 66; Ewald
   to 67; Renan and Kay to 65. On the other hand, Zahn gives as the date
   a.d. 80, Holtzmann and Harnack about 90, Volkmar and Keim, 116-118.
   These late dates are simply impossible, not only for intrinsic reasons
   and the allusion to Timothy, but also because Clement of Rome, who
   wrote about 95, shows a perfect familiarity with Hebrews.

   [1225] The inference of the place from hoi apo tes Italias Heb. 13:24,
   is uncertain, since in the epistolary style it may imply that the
   writer was at that time out of Italy, or in Italy (which would be more
   distinctly expressed by en Italia orhoi ex ). The brethren may have
   been fugitives from Italy (so Bleek). But the latter view seems more
   natural, and is defended by Theodoret, who knew Greek as his mother
   tongue. Tholuck and Ebrard quote the phrases hoi apo ges and hoi apo
   thalasses, travellers by land and sea, and from Polybius, hoi apo tes
   Alexandreias basileis, the Alexandrian kings. Still more to the point
   is Pseudo-Ignatius Ad. Her. 8, quoted by Zahn (see his ed. of Ign., p.
   270, 12): aspazontai se ... pantes hoi apo Philippon en christo, oten
   kai epesteila soi.

   [1226] The Sinaitic MS. and C have the subscription "to the Hebrews," A
   adds "from Rome," K "from Italy." Sam. Davidson dates it from
   Alexandria, Renan from Ephesus, where he thinks Barnabas was at that
   time with some fugitive Italians, while Timothy was imprisoned perhaps
   at Corinth (L'Antechrist. p. 210).

   [1227] For the patristic testimonies, I refer to the collection in
   Charteris, Canonicity, pp. 272-288; for a candid and exhaustive
   discussion of the whole question, to Bleek's large Com., I., 82-272;
   also to Alford's Com., vol iv., Part I., pp. 1-62

   [1228] Von Hofmann (of Erlangen) is almost the only one in Germany;
   Bishop Wordsworth and Dr. Kay in England. Among the older defenders of
   the Pauline authorship we mention Owen (1668), Mill (1707), Carpzov
   (1750), Bengel (1752). Sykes (1755), Andr. Cramer (1757), Storr (1789),
   and especially the learned and acute Roman Catholic scholar, Hug, in
   his Einleitung.

   [1229] Dr. Biesenthal has, by a retranslation of the Ep. into Hebrew,
   endeavored to prove this theory in "Das Trostschreiben des Ap. Paulus
   an die Hebraeer,"Leipz., 1878. But, of course, this is no argument any
   more than Delitzsch's Hebrew translation of the entire New Testament.
   Such happy phrases as polumeros kai polutropos (Heb.1:1) and emathen
   eph' hon epathen ten hupakoen (5:8) cannot be reproduced in Hebrew at
   all.

   [1232] "Pauli Apostoli epistolae tredecim, ejusdem ad Hebraeos una."

   [1233] Calvin: "Scriptor unum se ex apostolorum discipulis profitetur,
   quod est a Paulina consuetudine longe alienum." And on Heb. 2:3, "Hic
   locus indicio est; epistolam a Paulo non fuisse compositam,"etc.

   [1234] As Calvin expresses it: "Ipsa docendi ratio et stilus alium quam
   Paulum esse satis testantur." On this point see especially Riehm's
   valuable Lehrbegriff, etc., and the respective sections in the works on
   the N. T. Theology; also Kurtz's Com., pp. 24 sqq. The parallelisms
   which Dr. Kay sets against this argument in the Speaker's Com., pp. 14
   sqq., only prove what nobody denies, the essential agreement of Hebrews
   with the Pauline Epistles

   [1235] See the proof in Bleek, vol. I. 338-375. Conveniently ignored in
   the Speaker's Com., p. 13.

   [1236] Of the other friends of Paul, Timothy is excluded by the
   reference to him in Heb. 13:23. Mark, Demas, Titus, Tychicus,
   Epaphroditus, Epaphras, Aristarchus, Aquila, Jesus Justus have never
   been brought forward as candidates. Silvanus, or Silas, is favorably
   mentioned by Böhme, Mynster, and Riehm (890 sqq.), on account of his
   prominent position, Acts 15:22, 27, 34, 40; 16:19; 1 Pet. 5:12.

   [1237] Tertullian, Ullmann, Wieseler, Thiersch, Ritschl, Renan, Zahn.
   W. R. Smith (in the "Enc. Brit.") likewise leans to the Barnabas
   hypothesis.

   [1238] Clement of Alexandria (who, however, regarded Luke only, and
   wrongly, as translator), Calvin, Grotius, Crell, Ebrard, Delitzsch,
   Döllinger. Ebrard supposes that Luke wrote the Epistle at the request
   and in the name of Paul, who suggested the general plan and leading
   ideas. This is the most plausible form of the Luke hypothesis, but does
   not account for the doctrinal differences.

   [1239] This linguistic argument has been overdone by Delitzsch and
   weakened by fanciful or far-fetched analogies. See the strictures of
   Lünemann, pp. 24-31.

   [1240] Mentioned as a subjective conjecture by Origen (Klemes ho
   genomenos episkopos Rhomaion egrapse ten epistolen) alongside with
   Luke. Renewed by Erasmus and Bisping.

   Reuss, Bunsen, Hilgenfeld, Lange, Moll, Kendrick, Alford, Lünemann,
   Kurtz, Samuel Davidson, A. B. Davidson. The Apollos hypothesis has been
   the most popular until, within the last few years, Renan, Zahn, and W.
   Robertson Smith have turned the current again in favor of the Barnabas
   hypothesis. Riehm, after a full and judicious discussion, wavers
   between Apollos and Silvanus, but ends with Origen's modest confession
   of ignorance (p. 894).

   (1662); Bossuet (1690, and in Oeuvres, vol. III., 1819); Bisping

   Bishop Thomas Newton (in Dissertations on the Prophecies, 8 vols.,
   1758).

   This list is a small selection. The literature on the Apocalypse,
   especially in English, is immense, but mostly impository rather than
   expository, and hence worthless or even mischievous, because
   confounding and misleading. Darling's list of English works on the
   Apocalypse contains nearly fifty-four columns (I., 1732-1786).

   General Character of the Apocalypse.

   The "Revelation" of John, or rather "of Jesus Christ" through John,
   [1243] appropriately closes the New Testament. It is the one and only
   prophetic book, but based upon the discourses of our Lord on the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, and his second
   advent (Matt. 24). It has one face turned back to the prophecies of
   old, the other gazing into the future. It combines the beginning and
   the end in Him who is "the Alpha and the Omega." It reminds one of the
   mysterious sphinx keeping ceaseless watch, with staring eyes, at the
   base of the Great Pyramid. "As many words as many mysteries," says
   Jerome; "Nobody knows what is in it," adds Luther. [1244] No book has
   been more misunderstood and abused; none calls for greater modesty and
   reserve in interpretation. [1245]

   The opening and closing chapters are as clear and dazzling as sunlight,
   and furnish spiritual nourishment and encouragement to the plainest
   Christian; but the intervening visions are, to most readers, as dark as
   midnight, yet with many stars and the full moon illuminating the
   darkness. The Epistles to the Seven Churches, the description of the
   heavenly Jerusalem, and the anthems and doxologies [1246] which are
   interspersed through the mysterious visions, and glister like brilliant
   jewels on a canopy of richest black, are among the most beautiful,
   sublime, edifying, and inspiring portions of the Bible, and they ought
   to guard us against a hasty judgment of those chapters which we may be
   unable to understand. The Old Testament prophets were not clearly
   understood until the fulfilment cast its light upon them, and yet they
   served a most useful purpose as books of warning, comfort, and hope for
   the coming Messiah. The Revelation will be fully revealed when the new
   heavens and the new earth appear--not before. [1247]

   "A prophet" (says the sceptical DeWette in his Commentary on
   Revelation, which was his last work) "is essentially an inspired man,
   an interpreter of God, who announces the Word of God to men in
   accordance with, and within the limits of, the divine truth already
   revealed through Moses in the Old Testament, through Christ in the New
   (the apokalupsis musteriou, Rom. 16:25. Prophecy rests on faith in a
   continuous providence of God ruling over the whole world, and with
   peculiar efficacy over Israel and the congregation of Christ, according
   to the moral laws revealed through Moses and Christ especially the laws
   of retribution. According to the secular view, all changes in human
   affairs proceed partly from man's power and prudence, partly from
   accident and the hidden stubbornness of fate; but according to the
   prophetic view, everything happens through the agency of God and in
   harmony with his counsels of eternal and unchangeable justice, and man
   is the maker of his own fortunes by obeying or resisting the will of
   God." [1248]

   The prophecy of the Bible meets the natural desire to know the future,
   and this desire is most intense in great critical periods that are
   pregnant with fears and hopes. But it widely differs from the oracles
   of the heathen, and the conjectures of farseeing men. It rests on
   revelation, not on human sagacity and guesses; it gives certainty, not
   mere probability; it is general, not specific; it does not gratify
   curiosity, but is intended to edify and improve. The prophets are not
   merely revealers of secrets, but also preachers of repentance,
   revivalists, comforters, rebuking sin, strengthening faith, encouraging
   hope.

   The Apocalypse is in the New Testament what the Book of Daniel is in
   the Old, and differs from it as the New Testament differs from the Old.
   Both are prophetic utterances of the will of God concerning the future
   of his kingdom on earth. Both are books of the church militant, and
   engage heaven and earth, divine, human, and satanic powers, in a
   conflict for life and death. They march on as "a terrible army with
   banners." They reverberate with thunderings and reflect the lightning
   flashes from the throne. But while Daniel looks to the first advent of
   the Messiah as the heir of the preceding world-monarchies, John looks
   to the second advent of Christ and the new heavens and the new earth.
   He gathers up all the former prophecies and sends them enriched to the
   future. He assures us of the final fulfilment of the prophecy of the
   serpent-bruiser, which was given to our first parents immediately after
   the fall as a guiding star of hope in the dark night of sin. He blends
   the glories of creation and redemption in the finale of the new
   Jerusalem from heaven.

   The Apocalypse, as to its style of composition, is written in prose,
   like Daniel, but belongs to prophetic poetry, which is peculiar to the
   Bible and takes there the place of the epic poetry of the Greeks; God
   himself being the hero, as it were, who rules over the destinies of
   man. It is an inspired work of art, and requires for its understanding
   a poetic imagination, which is seldom found among commentators and
   critics; but the imagination must be under the restraint of sober
   judgment, or it is apt to run into fantastic comments which themselves
   need a commentary. The apocalyptic vision is the last and most complete
   form of the prophetic poetry of the Bible. The strong resemblance
   between the Revelation and Daniel, Ezekiel and Zechariah is admitted,
   and without them it cannot be understood.

   But we may compare it also, as to its poetic form and arrangement, with
   the book of Job. Both present a conflict on earth, controlled by
   invisible powers in heaven. In Job it is the struggle of an individual
   servant of God with Satan, the arch-slanderer and persecutor of man,
   who, with the permission of God, uses temporal losses, bodily
   sufferings, mental anguish, harassing doubt, domestic affliction, false
   and unfeeling friends to secure his ruin. In the Apocalypse it is the
   conflict of Christ and his church with the anti-Christian world. In
   both the scene begins in heaven; in both the war ends in victory but in
   Job long life and temporal prosperity of the individual sufferer is the
   price, in the Apocalypse redeemed humanity in the new heavens and the
   new earth. Both are arranged in three parts: a prologue, the battle
   with successive encounters, and an epilogue. In both the invisible
   power presiding over the action is the divine counsel of wisdom and
   mercy, in the place of the dark impersonal fate of the Greek drama.
   [1249]

   A comparison between the Apocalypse and the pseudo-apocalyptic Jewish
   and Christian literature--the Fourth Book of Esdras, the Book of Enoch,
   the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Apocalypse of Baruch, the
   Sibylline Oracles, etc.--opens a wide field on which we cannot enter
   without passing far beyond the limits of this work. We may only say
   that the relation is the same as that between the canonical Gospels and
   the apocryphal pseudo-Gospels, between real history and the dreamland
   of fable, between the truth of God and the fiction of man. [1250]

   The theme of the Apocalypse is: "I come quickly," and the proper
   attitude of the church toward it is the holy longing of a bride for her
   spouse, as expressed in the response (Rev. 22:20): "Amen: come, Lord
   Jesus." It gives us the assurance that Christ is coming in every great
   event, and rules and overrules all things for the ultimate triumph of
   his kingdom; that the state of the church on earth is one of continual
   conflict with hostile powers, but that she is continually gaining
   victories and will at last completely and finally triumph over all her
   foes and enjoy unspeakable bliss in communion with her Lord. From the
   concluding chapters Christian poetry has drawn rich inspiration, and
   the choicest hymns on the heavenly home of the saints are echoes of
   John's description of the new Jerusalem. The whole atmosphere of the
   book is bracing, and makes one feel fearless and hopeful in the face of
   the devil and the beasts from the abyss. The Gospels lay the foundation
   in faith, the Acts and Epistles build upon it a holy life; the
   Apocalypse is the book of hope to the struggling Christian and the
   militant church, and insures final victory and rest. This has been its
   mission; this will be its mission till the Lord come in his own good
   time. [1251]

   Analysis of Contents.

   The Apocalypse consists of a Prologue, the Revelation proper, and an
   Epilogue. We may compare this arrangement to that of the Fourth Gospel,
   where John 1:1-18 forms the Prologue, John 21 the Epilogue, and the
   intervening chapters contain the evangelical history from the gathering
   of the disciples to the Resurrection.

   I. The Prologue and the Epistles to the Seven Churches, Rev. 1-3. The
   introductory notice; John's salutation and dedication to the Seven
   Churches in Asia; the vision of Christ in his glory, and the Seven
   Churches; the Seven Epistles addressed to them and through them to the
   whole church, in its various states. [1252]

   II. The Revelation proper or the Prophetic Vision of the Church of the
   Future, 4:1-22:5. It consists chiefly of seven Visions, which are again
   subdivided according to a symmetrical plan in which the numbers seven,
   three, four, and twelve are used with symbolic significance. There are
   intervening scenes of rest and triumph. Sometimes the vision goes back
   to the beginning and takes a new departure.

   (1) The Prelude in heaven, Rev. 4 and 5. (a) The appearance of the
   throne of God (Rev. 4). (b) The appearance of the Lamb who takes and
   opens the sealed book (Rev. 5).

   (2) The vision of the seven seals, with two episodes between the sixth
   and seventh seals, 6:1-8:1.

   (3) The vision of the seven trumpets of vengeance, 8:2-11:19.

   (4) The vision of the woman (the church) and her three enemies,
   12:1-13:18. The three enemies are the dragon (12:3-17), the beast from
   the sea (12:18-13:10), and the beast from the earth, or the false
   prophet (13:11-18).

   (5) The group of visions in Rev 14: (a) the vision of the Lamb on Mount
   Zion (14:1-5); (b) of the three angels of judgment (14:6-11), followed
   by an episode (14:12, 13); (c) the vision of the harvest and the
   vintage of the earth (14:14-20).

   (6) The vision of the seven vials of wrath, 15:1-16:21.

   (7) The vision of the final triumph, 17:1-22:5: (a) the fall of Babylon
   (17:1-19:10); (b) the overthrow of Satan (19:11-20:10), with the
   millennial reign intervening (20:1-6); (c) the universal judgment
   (20:11-15); (d) the new heavens and the new earth, and the glories of
   the heavenly Jerusalem (21:1-22:5).

   III. The Epilogue, 22:6-21. The divine attestation, threats, and
   promises.

   Authorship and Canonicity.

   The question of authorship has already been discussed in connection
   with John's Gospel. The Apocalypse professes to be the work of John,
   who assumes a commanding position over the churches of Asia. History
   knows only one such character, the Apostle and Evangelist, and to him
   it is ascribed by the earliest and most trustworthy witnesses, going
   back to the lifetime of many friends and pupils of the author. It is
   one of the best authenticated books of the New Testament. [1253]

   And yet, owing to its enigmatical obscurity, it is the most disputed of
   the seven Antilegomena; and this internal difficulty has suggested the
   hypothesis of the authorship of "Presbyter John," whose very existence
   is doubtful (being based on a somewhat obscure passage of Papias), and
   who at all events could not occupy a rival position of superintendency
   over the churches in Asia during the lifetime of the great John. The
   Apocalypse was a stumbling-block to the spiritualism of the Alexandrian
   fathers, and to the realism of the Reformers (at least Luther and
   Zwingli), and to not a few of eminent modern divines; and yet it has
   attracted again and again the most intense curiosity and engaged the
   most patient study of devout scholars; while humble Christians of every
   age are cheered by its heroic tone and magnificent close in their
   pilgrimage to the heavenly Jerusalem. Rejected by many as unapostolic
   and uncanonical, and assigned to a mythical Presbyter John, it is now
   recognized by the severest school of critics as an undoubted production
   of the historical Apostle John. [1254]

   If so, it challenges for this reason alone our profound reverence. For
   who was better fitted to be the historian of the past and the seer of
   the future than the bosom friend of our Lord and Saviour? Able
   scholars, rationalistic as well as orthodox, have by thorough and
   patient investigation discovered or fully confirmed its poetic beauty
   and grandeur, the consummate art in its plan and execution. They have
   indeed not been able to clear up all the mysteries of this book, but
   have strengthened rather than weakened its claim to the position which
   it has ever occupied in the canon of the New Testament.

   It is true, the sceptical critics who so confidently vindicate the
   apostolic origin of the Apocalypse, derive from this very fact their
   strongest weapon against the apostolic origin of the fourth Gospel. But
   the differences of language and spirit which have been urged are by no
   means irreconcilable, and are overruled by stronger resemblances in the
   theology and christology and even in the style of the two books. A
   proper estimate of John's character enables us to see that he was not
   only able, but eminently fitted to write both; especially if we take
   into consideration the intervening distance of twenty or thirty years,
   the difference of the subject (prospective prophecy in one, and
   retrospective history in the other), and the difference of the state of
   mind, now borne along in ecstacy (en preumati) from vision to vision
   and recording what the Spirit dictated, now calmly collecting his
   reminiscences in full, clear self-consciousness (en noi). [1255]

   The Time of Composition.

   The traditional date of composition at the end of Domitian's reign (95
   or 96) rests on the clear and weighty testimony of Irenaeus, is
   confirmed by Eusebius and Jerome, and has still its learned defenders,
   [1256] but the internal evidence strongly favors an earlier date
   between the death of Nero (June 9, 68) and the destruction of Jerusalem
   (August 10, 70). [1257] This helps us at the same time more easily to
   explain the difference between the fiery energy of the Apocalypse and
   the calm repose of the fourth Gospel, which was composed in extreme old
   age. The Apocalypse forms the natural transition from the Synoptic
   Gospels to the fourth Gospel. The condition of the Seven Churches was
   indeed different from that which existed a few years before when Paul
   wrote to the Ephesians; but the movement in the apostolic age was very
   rapid. Six or seven years intervened to account for the changes. The
   Epistle to the Hebrews implies a similar spiritual decline among its
   readers in 63 or 64. Great revivals of religion are very apt to be
   quickly followed by a reaction of worldliness or indifference.

   The arguments for the early date are the following:

   1. Jerusalem was still standing, and the seer was directed to measure
   the Temple and the altar (Rev. 11:1), but the destruction is predicted
   as approaching. The Gentiles "shall tread (patesousin) the holy city
   under foot forty and two months" (11:2; Comp. Luke 21:24), and the
   "dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which
   spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was
   crucified" (Rev. 11:8). The existence of the twelve tribes seems also
   to be assumed in 7:4-8. The advocates of the traditional date
   understand these passages in a figurative sense. But the allusion to
   the crucifixion compels us to think of the historical Jerusalem.

   2. The book was written not long after the death of the fifth Roman
   emperor, that is, Nero, when the empire had received a deadly wound
   (comp. 13:3, 12, 14). This is the natural interpretation of 17:10,
   where it is stated that the seven heads of the scarlet-colored beast,
   i.e., heathen Rome, "are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is,
   the other is not yet come, and when he cometh, he must continue a
   little while." The first five emperors were Augustus, Tiberius,
   Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, with whom the gens Julia ingloriously
   perished. Next came Galba, a mere usurper (seventy-three years old),
   who ruled but a short time, from June, 68, to January, 69, and was
   followed by two other usurpers, Otho and Vitellius, till Vespasian, in
   70, restored the empire after an interregnum of two years, and left the
   completion of the conquest of the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem
   to his son Titus. [1258] Vespasian may therefore be regarded as the
   sixth head, the three rebels not being counted; and thus the
   composition of the Apocalypse would fall in the spring (perhaps Easter)
   of the year 70. This is confirmed by 13:3, 12, 14, where the deadly
   wound of the beast is represented as being already healed. [1259] But
   if the usurpers are counted, Galba is the sixth head, and the
   Revelation was written in 68. In either case Julius Caesar must be
   excluded from the series of emperors (contrary to Josephus).

   Several critics refer the seventh head to Nero, and ascribe to the seer
   the silly expectation of the return of Nero as Antichrist. [1260] In
   this way they understand the passage 17:11: "The beast that was, and is
   not, is himself also an eighth and is of the seven." But John makes a
   clear distinction between the heads of the beast, of whom Nero was one,
   and the beast itself, which is the Roman empire. I consider it simply
   impossible that John could have shared in the heathen delusion of Nero
   redivivus, which would deprive him of all credit as an inspired
   prophet. He may have regarded Nero as a fit type and forerunner of
   Antichrist, but only in the figurative sense in which Babylon of old
   was the type of heathen Rome.

   3. The early date is best suited for the nature and object of the
   Apocalypse, and facilitates its historical understanding. Christ
   pointed in his eschatological discourses to the destruction of
   Jerusalem and the preceding tribulation as the great crisis in the
   history of the theocracy and the type of the judgment of the world. And
   there never was a more alarming state of society. The horrors of the
   French Revolution were confined to one country, but the tribulation of
   the six years preceding the destruction of Jerusalem extended over the
   whole Roman empire and embraced wars and rebellions, frequent and
   unusual conflagrations, earthquakes and famines and plagues, and all
   sorts of public calamities and miseries untold. It seemed, indeed, that
   the world, shaken to its very centre, was coming to a close, and every
   Christian must have felt that the prophecies of Christ were being
   fulfilled before his eyes. [1261]

   It was at this unique juncture in the history of mankind that St. John,
   with the consuming fire in Rome and the infernal spectacle of the
   Neronian persecution behind him, the terrors of the Jewish war and the
   Roman interregnum around him, and the catastrophe of Jerusalem and the
   Jewish theocracy before him, received those wonderful visions of the
   impending conflicts and final triumphs of the Christian church. His was
   truly a book of the times and for the times, and administered to the
   persecuted brethren the one but all-sufficient consolation: Maran atha!
   Maran atha!

   Interpretation.

   The different interpretations are reduced by English writers to three
   systems according as the fulfilment of the prophecy is found in the
   past, present, or future. [1262]

   1. The Preterist system applies the Revelation to the destruction of
   Jerusalem and heathen Rome. So among Roman Catholics: Alcasar (1614),
   Bossuet (1690). Among Protestants: Hugo Grotius (1644), Hammond (1653),
   Clericus (1698), Wetstein (1752), Abauzit, Herder, Eichhorn, Ewald,
   Lücke, Bleek, DeWette, Reuss, Renan, F. D. Maurice, Samuel Davidson,
   Moses Stuart Cowles, Desprez, etc. Some [1263] refer it chiefly to the
   overthrow of the Jewish theocracy, others chiefly to the conflict with
   the Roman empire, still others to both.

   But there is a radical difference between those Preterists who
   acknowledge a real prophecy and permanent truth in the book, and the
   rationalistic Preterists who regard it as a dream of a visionary which
   was falsified by events, inasmuch as Jerusalem, instead of becoming the
   habitation of saints, remained a heap of ruins, while Rome, after the
   overthrow of heathenism, became the metropolis of Latin Christendom.
   This view rests on a literal misunderstanding of Jerusalem.

   2. The Continuous (or Historical) system: The Apocalypse is a prophetic
   compend of church history and covers all Christian centuries to the
   final consummation. It speaks of things past, present, and future; some
   of its prophecies are fulfilled, some are now being fulfilled, and
   others await fulfillment in the yet unknown future. Here belong the
   great majority of orthodox Protestant commentators and polemics who
   apply the beast and the mystic Babylon and the mother of harlots
   drunken with the blood of saints to the church of Rome, either
   exclusively or chiefly. But they differ widely among themselves in
   chronology and the application of details. Luther, Bullinger, Collado,
   Pareus, Brightman, Mede, Robert Fleming, Whiston, Vitringa, Bengel,
   Isaac Newton, Bishop Newton, Faber, Woodhouse, Elliott, Birks, Gaussen,
   Auberlen, Hengstenberg, Alford, Wordsworth, Lee.

   3. The Futurist system: The events of the Apocalypse from Rev. 4 to the
   close lie beyond the second advent of Christ. This scheme usually
   adopts a literal interpretation of Israel, the Temple, and the numbers
   (the 31 times, 42 months, 1260 days, 3 1/2 years). So Ribera (a Jesuit,
   1592), Lacunza (another Jesuit, who wrote under the name of Ben-Ezra
   "On the coming of Messiah in glory and majesty," and taught the
   premillennial advent, the literal restoration of the ancient Zion, and
   the future apostasy of the clergy of the Roman church to the camp of
   Antichrist), S. R. Maitland, De Burgh, Todd, Isaac Williams, W. Kelly.

   Another important division of historical interpreters is into
   Post-Millennarians and Pre-Millennarians, according as the millennium
   predicted in Rev. 20 is regarded as part or future. Augustin committed
   the radical error of dating the millennium from the time of the
   Apocalypse or the beginning of the Christian era (although the seer
   mentioned it near the end of his book), and his view had great
   influence; hence the wide expectation of the end of the world at the
   close of the first millennium of the Christian church. Other
   post-millennarian interpreters date the millennium from the triumph of
   Christianity over paganism in Rome at the accession of Constantine the
   Great (311); still others (as Hengstenberg) from the conversion of the
   Germanic nations or the age of Charlemagne. All these calculations are
   refuted by events. The millennium of the Apocalypse must he in the
   future, and is still an article of hope.

   The grammatical and historical interpretation of the Apocalypse, as
   well as of any other book, is the only safe foundation for all
   legitimate spiritual and practical application. Much has been done in
   this direction by the learned commentators of recent times. We must
   explain it from the standpoint of the author and in view of his
   surroundings. He wrote out of his time and for his time of things which
   must shortly come to pass (1:1, 3; 22:20), and he wished to be read and
   understood by his contemporaries (1:3). Otherwise he would have written
   in vain, and the solemn warning at the close (22:18, 19) would be
   unintelligible. In some respects they could understand him better than
   we; for they were fellow-sufferers of the fiery persecutions and
   witnesses of the fearful judgments described. Undoubtedly he had in
   view primarily the overthrow of Jerusalem and heathen Rome, the two
   great foes of Christianity at that time. He could not possibly ignore
   that great conflict.

   But his vision was not confined to these momentous events. It extends
   even to the remotest future when death and Hades shall be no more, and
   a new heaven and a new earth shall appear. And although the fulfilment
   is predicted as being near at hand, he puts a millennium and a short
   intervening conflict before the final overthrow of Satan, the beast,
   and the false prophet. We have an analogy in the prophecy of the Old
   Testament and the eschatalogical discourses of our Lord, which furnish
   the key for the understanding of the Apocalypse. He describes the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the general judgment in close proximity,
   as if they were one continuous event. He sees the end from the
   beginning. The first catastrophe is painted with colors borrowed from
   the last, and the last appears as a repetition of the first on a grand
   and universal scale. It is the manner of prophetic vision to bring
   distant events into close proximity, as in a panorama. To God a
   thousand years are as one day. Every true prophecy, moreover, admits of
   an expanding fulfilment. History ever repeats itself, though never in
   the same way. There is nothing old under the sun, and, in another
   sense, there is nothing new under the sun.

   In the historical interpretation of details we must guard against
   arbitrary and fanciful schemes, and mathematical calculations, which
   minister to idle curiosity, belittle the book, and create distrust in
   sober minds. The Apocalypse is not a prophetical manual of church
   history and chronology in the sense of a prediction of particular
   persons, dates, and events. This would have made it useless to the
   first readers, and would make it useless now to the great mass of
   Christians. It gives under symbolic figures and for popular edification
   an outline of the general principles of divine government and the
   leading forces in the conflict between Christ's kingdom and his foes,
   which is still going on under ever-varying forms. In this way it
   teaches, like all the prophetic utterances of the Gospels and Epistles,
   lessons of warning and encouragement to every age. We must distinguish
   between the spiritual coming of Christ and his personal arrival or
   parousia. The former is progressive, the latter instantaneous. The
   coming began with his ascension to heaven (comp. Matt. 26:64:
   "Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of
   power, and coming on the clouds of heaven") and goes on in unbroken
   succession of judgments and blessings (for "the history of the world is
   a judgment of the world"); hence the alternation of action and repose,
   of scenes of terror and scenes of joy, of battles and victories. The
   arrival of the Bridegroom is still in the unknown future, and may be
   accelerated or delayed by the free action of the church, but it is as
   certain as the first advent of Christ. The hope of the church will not
   be disappointed, for it rests on the promise of Him who is called "the
   Amen, the faithful and true witness" (Rev. 3:14).

   Notes.

   The Number 666.

   The historical understanding of the Apocalypse turns, according to its
   own statement, chiefly on the solution of the numerical riddle in the
   thirteenth chapter, which has tried the wits of commentators from the
   time of Irenaeus in the second century to the present day, and is still
   under dispute. The history of its solution is a history of the
   interpretation of the whole book. Hence I present here a summary of the
   most important views. First some preliminary remarks.

   1. The text, Apoc. 13:18: "Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding,
   let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man
   (arithmos gar anthropou estin), and the number is six hundred and
   sixty-six " chxs orhexakosioi hexekonta hex ).

   This is the correct reading in the Greek text (supported by Codd. ', A,
   B (2), P (2), Origen, Primasius, and Versions), and is adopted by the
   best editors. Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. v. 30, quoted also in full by
   Tischendorf in his edition VIII. critica major) found it "in all the
   most approved and ancient copies" (en pasi tois spoudaiois kai
   archaiois antigraphois), and "attested by those who had themselves seen
   John face to face." There was, however, in his day, a very remarkable
   variation, sustained by Cod. C, and "some" copies, known to, but not
   approved by, Irenaeus, namely, 616. (chis, i.e., hexakosioi deka hex)
   In the Anglo-American revision this reading is noted in the margin.

   2. "The number of a man" may mean either the number of an individual,
   or of a corporate person, or a human number (Menschenzahl), i.e., a
   number according to ordinary human reckoning (so Bleek, who compares
   metron anthropou, , "the measure of a man," Rev. 21:17, and Isa. 8:1).
   Just because the number may be counted in the customary way, the writer
   could expect the reader to find it out. He made the solution difficult
   indeed, but not impossible. Dr. Lee (p. 687) deems it not inconsistent
   with a proper view of inspiration that John himself did not know the
   meaning of the number. But how could he then ask his less knowing
   readers to count the number?

   3. The mystic use of numbers (the rabbinical Ghematria, geometria) was
   familiar to the Jews in Babylon, and passed from them to the Greeks in
   Asia. It occurs in the Cabbala, in the Sibylline Books (I. 324-331), in
   the Epistle of Barnabas, and was very common also among the Gnostic
   sects (e g., the Abrasax or Abraxas, which signified the unbegotten
   Father, and the three hundred and sixty-five heavens, corresponding to
   the number of days in the year). [1264] It arose from the employment of
   the letters of the Hebrew and Greek alphabets for the designation of
   numbers. The Hebrew Aleph counts 1, Beth 2, etc., Yodh 10; but Kaph
   (the eleventh letter) counts 20, Resh (the twentieth letter) 200, etc.
   The Greek letters, with the addition of an acute accent (as a', b'),
   have the same numerical value in their order down to Sigma, which
   counts 200; except that s' (st) is used for 6, and Ph' (an antiquated
   letter Koppa between pand r) for 90. The Hebrew alphabet ends with Tau=
   400, the Greek with Omega = 800. To express thousands an accent is put
   beneath the letter, as,a, = 1,000; ,b, = 2,000; ,i, = 10,000.

   4. On this fact most interpretations of the Apocalyptic puzzle are
   based. It is urged by Bleek, DeWette, Wieseler, and others, that the
   number 666 must be deciphered from the Greek alphabet, since the book
   was written in Greek and for Greek readers, and uses the Greek letters
   Alpha and Omega repeatedly as a designation of Christ, the Beginning
   and the End (1:8; 21:6; 22:13). On the other hand, Ewald and Renan, and
   all who favor the Nero-hypothesis, appeal against this argument to the
   strongly Hebraistic spirit and coloring of the Apocalypse and the
   familiarity of its Jewish Christian readers with the Hebrew alphabet.
   The writer, moreover, may have preferred this for the purpose of
   partial concealment; just as he substituted Babylon for Rome (comp. 1
   Pet. 5:13). But after all, the former view is much more natural. John
   wrote to churches of Asia Minor, chiefly gathered from Gentile converts
   who knew no Hebrew. Had he addressed Christians in Palestine, the case
   might be different.

   5. The number 666 (three sixes) must, in itself, be a significant
   number, if we keep in view the symbolism of numbers which runs through
   the whole Apocalypse. It is remarkable that the numerical value of the
   name Jesus is 888 (three eights), and exceeds the trinity of the sacred
   number (777) as much as the number of the beast falls below it. [1265]

   6. The "beast" coming out of the sea and having seven heads and ten
   horns (Rev. 13:1-10) is the anti-Christian world-power at war with the
   church of Christ. It is, as in Daniel, an apt image of the brutal
   nature of the pagan state. It is, when in conflict with the church, the
   secular or political Antichrist; while "the false prophet," who works
   signs and deceives the worshippers of the beast (16:13; 19:20; 20:10),
   is the intellectual and spiritual Antichrist, in close alliance with
   the former, his high-priest and minister of cultus, so to say, and
   represents the idolatrous religion which animates and supports the
   secular imperialism. In wider application, the false prophet may be
   taken as the personification of all false doctrine and heresy by which
   the world is led astray. For as there are "many Antichrists," so there
   are also many false prophets. The name "Antichrist," however, never
   occurs in the Apocalypse, but only in the Epistles of John (five
   times), and there in the plural, in the sense of "false prophets" or
   heretical teachers, who deny that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh (1
   John 4:1-3). Paul designates the Antichrist as, "the man of sin," the
   son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is
   called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of
   God, setting himself forth as God" (2 Thess. 2:3, 4). But he seems to
   look upon the Roman empire as a restraining power which, for a time at
   least, prevented the full outbreak of the "mystery of lawlessness,"
   then already at work (2:6-8). He thus wrote a year or two before the
   accession of Nero, and sixteen years or more before the composition of
   the Apocalypse.

   The beast must refer to heathen Rome and the seven heads to seven
   emperors. This is evident from the allusion to the "seven mountains,"
   that is, the seven-hilled city (urbs septicollis) on which the woman
   sits, 17:9. But not a few commentators give it a wider meaning, and
   understand by the heads as many world-monarchies, including those of
   Daniel, before Christ, and extending to the last times. So Auberlen,
   Ganssen, Hengstenberg, Von Hofmann, Godet, and many English divines.

   7. The numerous interpretations of the mystic number of the beast may
   be reduced to three classes:

   (a) The figures 666 represent the letters composing the name of a
   historical power, or of a single man, in conflict with Christ and his
   church. Here belong the explanations: Latinus, Caesar-Augustus, Nero,
   and other Roman emperors down to Diocletian. Even such names as Julian
   the Apostate, Genseric, Mohammed (Maometis), Luther (Martinus
   Lauterus), Joannes Calvinus, Beza Antitheos, Louis XIV., Napoleon
   Bonaparte, the Duke of Reichstadt (called "King of Rome"), Napoleon
   III., have been discovered in the three sixes by a strange kind of
   imposition. [1266]

   (b) The number is chronological, and designates the duration of the
   life of the beast, whether it be heathenism, or Mohammedanism, or
   popery.

   (c) The number is symbolical of Antichrist and the anti-Christian
   power.

   We now proceed to the principal interpretations.

   Latinus or the Roman Empire.

   Lateinos (Lateinosfor latinos,Latinus), i.e., the Latin or Roman
   empire. This is the numerical value of 666 in Greek: l= 30 +a= 1 + t=
   300 + e = 5 + i= 10 + n= 50 + o= 70 + s= 200 = total 666. The Greek
   form Lateinosis no valid objection; for ei often represents the Latin
   long i, as in Antoneinos, Pauleinos, Papeiros Sabeinos, Phausteios.J.
   E. Clarke shows that he Latine basileia, "the Latin empire," likewise
   gives the number 666. [1267]

   This interpretation is the oldest we know of, and is already mentioned
   by Irenaeus, the first among the Fathers who investigated the problem,
   and who, as a pupil of Polycarp in Smyrna (d. 155), the personal friend
   of John, deserves special consideration as a witness of traditions from
   the school of the beloved disciple. He mentions three interpretations,
   all based on the Greek alphabet, namely Euanthas(which is of no
   account), Lateinos(which he deems possible), and Teitan, i.e., Titus
   (which he, upon the whole, prefers), but he abstains from a positive
   decision, for the reason that the Holy Scripture does not clearly
   proclaim the name of the beast or Antichrist. [1268]

   The interpretation Latinus is the only sensible one among the three,
   and adopted by Hippolytus, Bellarmin, Eichhorn, Bleek, DeWette, Ebrard,
   Düsterdieck, Alford, Wordsworth, Lee, and others.

   Latinus was the name of a king of Latium, but not of any Roman emperor.
   Hence it must here be taken in a generic sense, and applied to the
   whole heathen Roman empire.

   Here the Roman Catholic divines stop. [1269] But many Protestant
   commentators apply it also, in a secondary sense, to the Latin or papal
   church as far as it repeated in its persecuting spirit the sins of
   heathen Rome. The second beast which is described, Rev. 13:11-17, as
   coming out of the earth, and having two horns like unto a lamb, and
   speaking as a dragon, and exercising all the authority of the first
   beast in his sight, is referred to the papacy. The false prophet
   receives a similar application. So Luther, Vitringa, Bengel, Auberlen,
   Hengstenberg, Ebrard, and many English divines.

   Dean Alford advocates this double application in his Commentary. "This
   name," he says, "describes the common character of the rulers of the
   former Pagan Roman Empire--'Latini sunt qui nunc regnant,' Iren.: and,
   which Irenaeus could not foresee, unites under itself the character of
   the later Papal Roman Empire also, as revived and kept up by the agency
   of its false prophet, the priesthood. The Latin Empire, the Latin
   Church, Latin Christianity, have ever been its commonly current
   appellations: its language, civil and ecclesiastical, has ever been
   Latin: its public services, in defiance of the most obvious requisite
   for public worship, have ever been throughout the world conducted in
   Latin; there is no one word which could so completely describe its
   character, and at the same time unite the ancient and modern attributes
   of the two beasts, as this. Short of saying absolutely that this was
   the word in St. John's mind, I have the strongest persuasion that no
   other can be found approaching so near to a complete solution." Bishop
   Wordsworth gives the same anti-papal interpretation to the beast, and
   indulges in a variety of pious and farfetched fancies. See his Com. on
   13:18, and his special work on the Apocalypse.

   Nero.

   The Apocalypse is a Christian counterblast against the Neronian
   persecution, and Nero is represented as the beast of the abyss who will
   return as Antichrist. The number 666 signifies the very name of this
   imperial monster in Hebrew letters, rsq nvn , Neron Kaesar, as follows:
   n (n) = 50, r (r) = 200, v (o) = 6, n (n) = 50, q (k) = 100, s (s) =
   60, r (r) = 200; in all 666. The Neronian coins of Asia bear the
   inscription: Neron Kaisar. But the omission of the y(which would add 10
   to 666) from rsyq = Kaisar, has been explained by Ewald (Johanneische
   Schriften, II. 263) from the Syriac in which it is omitted, and this
   view is confirmed by the testimony of inscriptions of Palmyra from the
   third century; see Renan (L'Antechrist, p. 415).

   The coincidence, therefore, must be admitted, and is at any rate most
   remarkable, since Nero was the first, as well as the most wicked, of
   all imperial persecutors of Christianity, and eminently worthy of being
   characterized as the beast from the abyss, and being regarded as the
   type and forerunner of Antichrist.

   This interpretation, moreover, has the advantage of giving the number
   of a man or a particular person (which is not the case with Lateinos),
   and affords a satisfactory explanation of the varians lectio 616; for
   this number precisely corresponds to the Latin form, Nero Caesar, and
   was probably substituted by a Latin copyist, who in his calculation
   dropped the final Nun (= 50), from Neron (666 less 50=616).

   The series of Roman emperors (excluding Julius Caesar), according to
   this explanation, is counted thus: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
   Claudius, Nero, Galba. This makes Nero (who died June 9, 68) the fifth,
   and Galba the sixth, and seems to fit precisely the passage 17:10:
   "Five [of the seven heads of the beast] are fallen, the one [Galba] is,
   the other [the seventh] is not yet come; and when he cometh he must
   continue a little while." This leads to the conclusion that the
   Apocalypse was written during the short reign of Galba, between June 9,
   68, and January 15, 69. It is further inferred from 17:11 ("the beast
   that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven;
   and he goeth into perdition"), that, in the opinion of the seer and in
   agreement with a popular rumor, Nero, one of the seven emperors, would
   return as the eighth in the character of Antichrist, but shortly
   perish.

   This plausible solution of the enigma was almost simultaneously and
   independently discovered, between 1831 and 1837, by several German
   scholars, each claiming the credit of originality, viz.: C. F. A.
   Fritzsche (in the "Annalen der gesammten Theol. Liter.," I. 3, Leipzig,
   1831); F. Benary (in the "Zeitschrift für specul. Theol.," Berlin,
   1836); F. Hitzig (in Ostern und Pfingsten, Heidelb., 1837); E. Reuss
   (in the "Hallesche Allg. Lit.-Zeitung" for Sept., 1837); and Ewald, who
   claims to have made the discovery before 1831, but did not publish it
   till 1862. It has been adopted by Baur, Zeller, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar,
   Hausrath, Krenkel, Gebhardt, Renan, Aubé, Réville, Sabatier, Sam.
   Davidson (I. 291); and among American commentators by Stuart and
   Cowles. It is just now the most popular interpretation, and regarded by
   its champions as absolutely conclusive.

   But, as already stated in the text, there are serious objections to the
   Nero-hypothesis:

   (1) The language and readers of the Apocalypse suggest a Greek rather
   than a Hebrew explanation of the numerical riddle.

   (2) The seer clearly distinguishes the beast, as a collective name for
   the Roman empire (so used also by Daniel), from the seven heads, i.e.,
   kings (basileis) or emperors. Nero is one of the five heads who ruled
   before the date of the Apocalypse. He was "slain" (committed suicide),
   and the empire fell into anarchy for two years, until Vespasian
   restored it, and so the death-stroke was healed (Rev. 13:3). The three
   emperors between Nero and Vespasian (Galba, Otho, and Vitellius) were
   usurpers, and represent an interregnum and the deadly wound of the
   beast. This at least is a more worthy interpretation and consistent
   with the actual facts.

   It should be noticed, however, that Josephus, Ant. XVIIII. 2, 2; 6, 10,
   very distinctly includes Julius Caesar among the emperors, and calls
   Augustus the second, Tiberius the third, Caius Caligula the fourth
   Roman emperor. Suetonius begins his Lives of the Twelve Caesars with
   Julius and ends with Domitian, including the lives of Galba, Otho, and
   Vitellius. This fact tends at all events to weaken the foundation of
   the Nero-hypothesis.

   (3) It is difficult to conceive of a reasonable motive for concealing
   the detested name of Nero after his death. For this reason Cowles makes
   Nero the sixth emperor (by beginning the series with Julius Caesar) and
   assigns the composition to his persecuting reign. But this does not
   explain the wound of the beast and the statement that "it was and is
   not."

   (4) A radical error, such as the belief in the absurd heathen fable of
   the return of Nero, is altogether incompatible with the lofty character
   and profound wisdom of the Apocalypse, and would destroy all confidence
   in its prophecy. If John, as these writers maintain, composed it in 68,
   he lived long enough to be undeceived, and would have corrected the
   fatal blunder or withheld the book from circulation.

   (5) It seems incredible that such an easy solution of the problem
   should have remained unknown for eighteen centuries and been reserved
   for the wits of half a dozen rival rationalists in Germany. Truth is
   truth, and must be thankfully accepted from any quarter and at any
   time; yet as the Apocalypse was written for the benefit of
   contemporaries of Nero, one should think that such a solution would not
   altogether have escaped them. Irenaeus makes no mention of it.

   The Emperor of Rome.

   Caesar Romae, from mvr rsyq So Ewald formerly (in his first commentary,
   published in 1828). But this gives the number 616, which is rejected by
   the best critics in favor of 666. In his later work, Ewald adopts the
   Nero-hypothesis (Die Johanneischen Schriften, Bd. II., 1862, p. 202
   sq.).

   Caligula.

   From Gaios Kaisar. But this counts likewise 616.

   Titus.

   The Greek Teitan. Irenaeus considers this the most probable
   interpretation, because the word is composed of six letters, and
   belongs to a royal tyrant. If we omit the final n(n), we get the other
   reading (616). The objection is that Titus, the destroyer of Jerusalem,
   was one of the best emperors, and not a persecutor of Christians.

   Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.

   Wetstein refers the letters to Titus Flavius Vespasianus, father and
   sons (Titus and Domitian). He thinks that John used both numbers, 616
   in the first, 666 in the second edition of his book. "Eleganter" he
   says in his notes, et apposite Joannes Titum Flavium Vespasianum patrem
   et filios hoc nomine designat ... Convenit secundo nomen.
   Teitanpraenomini ipsorum Titus. Res ipsa etiam convenit. Titanes
   fuerunt theomachoi, tales etiam Vespasiani." Nov. Test., II., p. 806;
   comp. his critical note on p. 805.

   Diocletian.

   Diocletian, Emperor, in Roman characters, Diocles Augustus, counting
   only some of the letters, namely: DIo CLes aVg Vst Vs. [1270]
   Diocletian was the last of the persecuting emperors (d. 313). So
   Bossuet. To his worthless guess the Huguenots opposed the name of the
   "grand monarch" and persecutor of Protestants, Louis XIV., which yields
   the same result (LVDo VICVs).

   The Roman Emperors from Augustus To Vespasian.

   Märcker (in the "Studien und Kritiken" for 1868, p. 699) has found out
   that the initial letters of the first ten Roman emperors from
   Octavianus (Augustus) to Titus, including the three usurpers Galba,
   Otho, and Vitellius, yield the numerical value of 666. Düsterdieck (p.
   467) calls this "eine frappante Spielerei."

   Caesar Augustus.

   Kaisarsebaston(for-s, suited to the neuter therion), i.e., the "Caesar
   Augustan" beast. [1271] The official designation of the Roman emperors
   was Kaisar Sebastos(Caesar Augustus), in which their blasphemous
   apotheosis culminates. In support of it may be quoted "the names of
   blasphemy on the heads of the beast," Rev. 13:1.

   This is the conjecture proposed by Dr. Wieseler in his book: Zur
   Geschichte der Neutest. Schrift und des Urchristenthums, 1880, p. 169.
   It is certainly ingenious and more consistent with the character of the
   Apocalypse than the Nero-hypothesis. It substantially agrees with the
   interpretation Lateinos. But the substitution of a final n for sis an
   objection, though not more serious than the omission of the yodh from
   qyrs

   The Chronological Solutions.--The Duration of Antichrist.

   The number 666 signifies the duration of the beast or antichristian
   world power, and the false prophet associated with the beast.

   (1) The duration of Heathenism. But heathen Rome, which persecuted the
   church, was Christianized after the conversion of Constantine, a.d.
   311. The other forms and subsequent history of heathenism lie outside
   of the apocalyptic vision.

   (2) Mohammedanism. Pope Innocent III., when rousing Western Europe to a
   new crusade, declared the Saracens to be the beast, and Mohammed the
   false prophet whose power would last six hundred and sixty-six years.
   See his bull of 1213, in which he summoned the fourth Lateran Council,
   in Hardouin, Conc., Tom. VII. 3. But six hundred and sixty-six years
   have passed since the Hegira (622), and even since the fourth Lateran
   Council (1215); yet Islam still sits on the throne in Constantinople,
   and rules over one hundred and sixty million of consciences.

   (3). The anti-Christian Papacy. This interpretation was suggested by
   mediaeval sects hostile to Rome, and was matured by orthodox Protestant
   divines of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under the fresh
   impression of the fearful persecutions which were directly instigated
   or approved by the papacy, and which surpass in cruelty and extent the
   persecutions of heathen Rome. It is asserted that the terrible Duke of
   Alva alone put more Protestants to death in the Netherlands within a
   few years than all the heathen emperors from Nero to Diocletian; and
   that the victims of the Spanish Inquisition (105,000 persons in
   eighteen years under Torquemada's administration) outnumber the ancient
   martyrs. It became almost a Protestant article of faith that the
   mystical Babylon, the mother of harlots, riding on the beast, the woman
   drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs
   of Jesus (Apoc. 17:5 sqq.), is none other than the pseudo-Christian and
   anti-Christian church of Rome, and this view is still widely prevalent,
   especially in Great Britain and North America.

   Luther struck the key-note of this anti-popery exegesis. He had at
   first a very low opinion of the Apocalypse, and would not recognize it
   as apostolic or prophetic (1522), but afterward he utilized for polemic
   purposes (in a preface to his edition of the N. T. of 1530). He dated
   the one thousand years (Rev. 20:7) with Augustin from the composition
   of the book, and the six hundred and sixty-six years from Gregory VII.,
   as the supposed founder of the papacy, and understood Gog and Magog to
   mean the unspeakable Turks and the Jews. As Gregory VII. was elected
   pope 1073, the anti-Christian era ought to have come to an end a.d.
   1739; but that year passed off without any change in the history of the
   papacy.

   Luther was followed by Chytraeus (1563), Selnecker (1567), Hoe v.
   Honegg (1610 and 1640), and other Lutheran commentators. Calvin and
   Beza wisely abstained from prophetic exposition, but other Reformed
   divines carried out the anti-popery scheme with much learning, as
   Bibliander (1549 and 1559), Bullinger (1557), David Pareus (1618),
   Joseph Mede (the founder of the ingenious system of synchronism, in his
   Clavis Apocalyptica, 1627), Coccejus (1696), Vitringa (a very learned
   and useful commentator, 1705, 3d ed. 1721), and Joh. Albrecht Bengel
   (in his Gnomon, his Ordo Temporum, 1741, and especially his Erklärte
   Offenbarung Johannis, 1740, new ed. 1834). This truly great and good
   man elaborated a learned scheme of chronological interpretation, and
   fixed the end of the anti-Christian (papal) reign at the year 1836, and
   many pious people among his admirers in Würtemburg were in anxious
   expectation of the millennium during that year. But it passed away
   without any serious change, and this failure, according to Bengel's own
   correct prediction, indicates a serious error in his scheme. Later
   writers have again and again predicted the fall of the papacy and the
   beginning of the millennium, advancing the date as times progress; but
   the years 1848 and 1870 have passed away, and the Pope still lives,
   enjoying a green old age, with the additional honor of infallibility,
   which the Fathers never heard of, which even St. Peter never claimed,
   and St. Paul effectually disputed at Antioch. All mathematical
   calculations about the second advent are doomed to disappointment, and
   those who want to know more than our blessed Lord knew in the days of
   his flesh deserve to be disappointed. "It is not for you to know times
   or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority" (Acts
   1:7). This settles the question.

   Mystical and Symbolical Interpretations.

   The number is neither alphabetical nor chronological, but the mystical
   or symbolical name of Antichrist, who is yet to come. Here we meet
   again with different views.

   Primasius, the African commentator of the Apocalypse (a pupil of
   Augustin), mentions two names as giving the general characteristics of
   Antichrist: Antemosand arnoume, the former honori contrarius the other
   from arneomai, to deny, by which the Antichrist is justly described,
   "utpote per duas partes orationis, nominis scilicet et verbi, et
   personae qualitas et operis insinuatur asperitas." Utterly worthless.
   See Lücke, p. 997. Züllig finds in the figure the name of Bileam. Not
   much better is Hengstenberg's explanation: Adonikam, i.e., "The Lord
   arises," a good name for Antichrist (2 Thess. 2:4)! He bases it on Ezra
   2:13: "The children of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-six." Ezra gives
   a list of the children of Israel who returned from the captivity under
   Zerubbabel. What this has to do with Antichrist is difficult to see.

   Von Hofmann and Füller think that the number implies the personal name
   of Antichrist.

   Another view is this: the number is symbolical, like all other numbers
   in the Apocalypse, and signifies the anti-Christian world-power in all
   its successive forms from heathen Rome down to the end. Hence it admits
   of many applications, as there are "many Antichrists." The number six
   is the number of human work and toil (six days of the week), as seven
   is the number of divine rest. Or, six is the half of twelve--the number
   of the church--and indicates the divided condition of the temporal
   power. Three sixes signify worldliness (worldly glory, worldly wisdom,
   worldly civilization) at the height of power, which with all vaunted
   strength is but weakness and folly, and falls short of the divine
   perfection symbolized by the numbers seven and twelve. Such or similar
   views were suggested by Herder, Auberlen, Rösch, Hengstenberg, Burger,
   Maurice, Wordsworth, Vaughan, Carpenter, etc.

   The Messiah of Satan.

   To the class of mystical interpretation belongs the recent view of
   Professor Godet, of Neuchatel, which deserves special mention. This
   eminent commentator sees in 666 the emblematic name of The Messiah of
   Satan in opposition to the divine Messiah. The number was originally
   represented by the three letters chxs'. The first and the last letters
   are an abridgment of the name of Christ, and have the value of 606 (x=
   600 + s= 6); the middle xis, in virtue of its form and of the sibilant
   sound, the emblem of Satan, and as a cipher has the value of 60. Satan
   is called in the Apocalypse the old serpent in allusion to the history
   of the temptation (Gen. 3). This explanation was first suggested by
   Heumann and Herder, and is made by Godet the basis of an original
   theory, namely, that Antichrist or the man of sin will be a Jew who
   will set up a carnal Israel in opposition to the true Messiah, and
   worship the prince of this world in order to gain universal empire.
   [1272] Corruptio optimi pessima. Renan says: "Nothing can equal in
   wickedness the wickedness of Jews: at the same time the best of men
   have been Jews; you may say of this race whatever good or evil you
   please, without danger of overstepping the truth." In blasphemy, as
   well as in adoration, the Jew is the foremost of mankind. Only an
   apostate can blaspheme with all his heart. Our Gentile Voltaires are
   but lambs as compared with Jews in reviling Christ and his church. None
   but Israel could give birth to Judas, none but apostate Israel can give
   birth to Antichrist. Israel answers precisely to the description of the
   apocalyptic beast, which was and is not and shall be (Rev. 17:11),
   which was wounded to death, and is to be miraculously healed, in order
   to play, as the eighth head, the part of Antichrist. Godet refers to
   the rising power of the Jews in wealth, politics, and literature, and
   especially their command of the anti-Christian press in Christian
   countries, as indications of the approach of the fulfilment of this
   prophecy.

   Godet holds to the late date of the Apocalypse under Domitian, and
   rejects the application of the seven heads of the beast to Roman
   emperors. He applies them, like Auberlen, Hengstenberg, and others, to
   as many empires, before and after Christ, but brings in, as a new
   feature, the Herodian dynasty, which was subject to the Roman power.

   According to his view, the first head is ancient Egypt trying to
   destroy Israel in its cradle; the second is the Assyro-Babylonian
   empire which destroyed the kingdom of the ten tribes, and then
   Jerusalem; the third is the Persian empire, which held restored Israel
   under its authority; the fourth is the Greek monarchy under Antiochus
   Epiphanes (the little horn of Daniel 8, the Antichrist of the Old
   Testament), who attempted to suppress the worship of God in Israel, and
   to substitute that of Zeus; the fifth is the Jewish state under the
   Herods and the pontificates of Annas and Caiaphas, who crucified the
   Saviour and then tried to destroy his church; the sixth is the Roman
   empire, which is supposed to embrace all political power in Europe to
   this day; the seventh head is that power of short duration which shall
   destroy the whole political system of Europe, and prepare it for the
   arrival of Antichrist from the bosom of infidel Judaism. In this way
   Godet harmonizes the Apocalypse with the teaching of Paul concerning
   the restraining effect of the Roman empire, which will be overthrown in
   order to give way to the full sway of Antichrist. The eighth head is
   Israel restored, with a carnal Messiah at its head, who will preach the
   worship of humanity and overthrow Rome, the old enemy of the Jews
   (Apoc. 18), but be overthrown in turn by Christ (Rev. 19 and 2 Thess.
   2:8). Then follows the millennium, the sabbath of humanity on earth
   after its long week of work, not necessarily a visible reign of Christ,
   but a reign by his Spirit. At the end of this period, Satan, who as yet
   is only bound, shall try once more to destroy the work of God, but
   shall only prepare his final defeat, and give the signal for the
   universal judgment (Rev. 20). The terrestrial state founded on the day
   of creation now gives place to the now heavens and the new earth (Rev.
   21), in which God shall be all in all. Anticipating the sight of this
   admirable spectacle, John prostrates himself and invites all the
   faithful to cry with the Spirit and the spouse, "Lord, come--come soon"
   (Rev. 22). What a vast drama! What a magnificent conclusion to the
   Scriptures opening with Genesis! The first creation made man free; the
   second shall make him holy, and then the work of God is accomplished.

   Conclusion.

   A very ingenious interpretation, with much valuable truth, but not the
   last word yet on this mysterious book, and very doubtful in its
   solution of the numerical riddle. The primary meaning of the beast, as
   already remarked, is heathen Rome, as represented by that monster
   tyrant and persecutor, Nero, the very incarnation of satanic
   wickedness. The oldest interpretation (Lateinos), known already to a
   grand-pupil of St. John, is also the best, and it is all the more
   plausible because the other interpretations which give us the
   alphabetical value of 666, namely, Nero and Caesar Augustus, likewise
   point to the same Roman power which kept up a bloody crusade of three
   hundred years against Christianity. But the political beast, and its
   intellectual ally, the false prophet, appear again and again in
   history, and make war upon the church and the truth of Christ, within
   and without the circle of the old Roman empire. Many more wonders of
   exegetical ability and historical learning will yet be performed before
   the mysteries of Revelation are solved, if they ever will be solved
   before the final fulfilment. In the meantime, the book will continue to
   accomplish its practical mission of comfort and encouragement to every
   Christian in the conflict of faith for the crown of life.

   Zwingli would take no doctrinal proof-text from Revelation.

   [1245] The amount of nonsense, false chronology, and prophecy which has
   been put into the Apocalypse is amazing, and explains the sarcastic
   saying of the Calvinistic, yet vehemently anti-Puritanic preacher,
   Robert South (Serm. XXIII., vol. I., 377, Philad. ed., 1844), that "the
   book called the Revelation, the more it is studied, the less it is
   understood, as generally either finding a man cracked, or making him
   so." The remark is sometimes falsely attributed to Calvin, but he had
   great respect for the book, and quotes it freely for doctrinal
   purposes, though he modestly or wisely abstained from writing a
   commentary on it.

   primary historical references, and yet these passages, containing
   divine truth, doctrine, and consolation, are manna for all hearts and

   almost all prophets and Apostles?"

   [1249] Prof. Godet compares the Apocalypse with the Song of Songs,
   viewed as a dramatic poem, and calls it "the Canticle of the New
   Testament," as the Song of Songs is "the Apocalypse of the Old." But I
   cannot see the aptness of this comparison. Eichhorn treated the
   Apocalypse as a regular drama with a prologue, three acts, and an
   epilogue.

   [1251] Godet (p. 297): "The Apocalypse is the precious vessel in which
   the treasure of Christian hope has been deposited for all ages of the
   church, but especially for the church under the cross." Dr. Chambers
   (p. 15): "The scope of this mysterious book is not to convince
   unbelievers, nor to illustrate the divine prescience, nor to minister
   to men's prurient desire to peer into the future, but to edify the
   disciples of Christ in every age by unfolding the nature and character
   of earth's conflicts, by preparing them for trial as not a strange
   thing, by consoling them with the prospect of victory, by assuring them
   of God's sovereign control over all persons and things, and by pointing
   them to the ultimate issue when they shall pass through the gates of
   pearl never more to go out."

   between the two books, and comes to the conclusion that they are both
   from the same Apostle John. "Yes" (he says, with reference to a
   significant concession of Dr. Baur), "the fourth Gospel is 'the
   spiritualized Apocalypse,' but not because an intellectual hero of the
   second century followed the seer of the Apocalypse, but because the Son
   of Thunder of the Apocalypse had been matured and transfigured by the
   Spirit and the divine guidance into a mystic, and the flames of his
   youth had burnt down into the glow of a holy love."

   "extreme," as distinguished from simple "Futurists," who refer the
   entire book, including Rev. 2 and 3, to the last times. Lee substitutes
   with Lücke the term "Historical" for "Continuous," but Historical
   applies better to the first class called "Preterists." Lee adds (491),
   as a fourth system, the "Spiritual system," and names Augustin (his
   "City of God," as the first philosophy of history), J. C. K. von
   Hofmann, Hengstenberg, Auberlen, Ebrard as its chief defenders. It is
   the same with what Auberlen calls the reichsgeschichtliche Auslegung.

   [1263] So Herder, in his suggestive book MARAN AThA, das Buch von der
   Zukunft des Herrn, des N. Testaments Siegel, Riga, 1779. He was
   preceded in the anti-Jewish explication by Abauzit of Geneva (1730),
   who assigned the book to the reign of Nero, and Wetstein (1752), and
   followed by Hartwig (1780) and Züllig. The last, in a learned work on
   the Apocalypse (Stuttgart, 1834, 2 vols., 1840), refers it exclusively
   to the Jewish state.

   [1264] a = 1, b = 2, r = 100, a = 1, x = 60, a = 1, s = 200; total,

   his followers.

   [1266] These pious absurdities are surpassed by the rationalistic
   absurdity of Volkmar, who (in his Com. on the Apoc., 1862, p. 197)
   carries the imaginary hostility of John to Paul so far as to refer "the
   false prophet" (Rev. 16:13; 19:20) to the Apostle of the Gentiles,
   because he taught (Rom. 13) that every soul should be subject to the
   then reigning Nero (ie., the beast)! Even Hilgenfeld (Einleit. p. 436)
   and Samuel Davidson (I. 291), while agreeing with Volkmar in the
   Nero-hypothesis, protest against such impious nonsense.

   [1267] See Lee, Com. p. 687. Adam Clarke regarded this unanswerable.

   [1268] Adv. Haer., v. 30, §§3 and 4. Josephus, from prudential regard
   to his patrons, the Flavian emperors, withheld the interpretation of
   the fourth beast and the stone cut out of the mountain in Daniel's
   vision. Ant. x. 10, § 4. On which Havercamp remarks: "Nor is this to be
   wondered at that he would not now meddle with things future; for he had
   no mind to provoke the Romans by speaking of the destruction of that
   city, which they called the eternal city."

   [1269] If they go farther, they discover the anti-Christian beast in
   the mediaeval German (the so-called "Holy Roman") empire in conflict
   with the papacy, in the Napoleonic imperialism, the Russian Czarism,
   the modern German empire (the anti-papal Cultur-Kampf ), in fact in
   every secular power which is hostile to the interests of the Roman
   hierarchy and will "not go to Canossa." This would be the very reverse
   of the old Protestant interpretation.

   [1270] D = 500 + I = 1 + C = 100 + L = 50 + V = 5 + V = 5 = 666.

   § 102. Concluding Reflections. Faith and Criticism.

   There is no necessary conflict between faith and criticism any more
   than between revelation and reason or between faith and philosophy. God
   is the author of both, and he cannot contradict himself. There is an
   uncritical faith and a faithless criticism as there is a genuine
   philosophy and a philosophy falsely so called; but this is no argument
   either against faith or criticism; for the best gifts are liable to
   abuse and perversion; and the noblest works of art may be caricatured.
   The apostle of faith directs us to "prove all things," and to "hold
   fast that which is good." We believe in order to understand, and true
   faith is the mother of knowledge. A rational faith in Christianity, as
   the best and final religion which God gave to mankind, owes it to
   itself to examine the foundation on which it rests; and it is urged by
   an irresistible impulse to vindicate the truth against every form of
   error. Christianity needs no apology. Conscious of its supernatural
   strength, it can boldly meet every foe and convert him into an ally.

   Looking back upon the history of the apostolic age, it appears to us as
   a vast battle-field of opposite tendencies and schools. Every inch of
   ground is disputed and has to be reconquered; every fact, as well as
   every doctrine of revelation, is called in question; every hypothesis
   is tried; all the resources of learning, acumen, and ingenuity are
   arrayed against the citadel of the Christian faith. The citadel is
   impregnable, and victory is certain, but not to those who ignorantly or
   superciliously underrate the strength of the besieging army. In the
   sixteenth century the contest was between Roman Catholicism and
   Evangelical Protestantism; in the nineteenth century the question is
   Christianity or infidelity. Then both parties believed in the
   inspiration of the New Testament and the extent of the canon, differing
   only in the interpretation; now inspiration is denied, and the
   apostolicity of all but four or five books is assailed. Then the Word
   of God, with or without tradition, was the final arbiter of religious
   controversies; now human reason is the ultimate tribunal.

   We live in an age of discovery, invention, research, and doubt.
   Scepticism is well nigh omnipresent in the thinking world. It
   impregnates the atmosphere. We can no more ignore it than the ancient
   Fathers could ignore the Gnostic speculations of their day. Nothing is
   taken for granted; nothing believed on mere authority; everything must
   be supported by adequate proof, everything explained in its natural
   growth from the seed to the fruit. Roman Catholics believe in an
   infallible oracle in the Vatican; but whatever the oracle may decree,
   the earth moves and will continue to move around the sun. Protestants,
   having safely crossed the Red Sea, cannot go back to the flesh-pots of
   the land of bondage, but must look forward to the land of promise. In
   the night, says a proverb, all cattle are black, but the daylight
   reveals the different colors.

   Why did Christ not write the New Testament, as Mohammed wrote the
   Koran? Writing was not beneath his dignity; he did write once in the
   sand, though we know not what. God himself wrote the Ten Commandments
   on two tables of stone. But Moses broke them to pieces when he saw that
   the people of Israel worshipped the golden calf before the thunders
   from Sinai had ceased to reverberate in their ears. They might have
   turned those tables into idols. God buried the great law-giver out of
   sight and out of the reach of idolatry. The gospel was still less
   intended to be a dumb idol than the law. It is not a killing letter but
   a life-giving spirit. It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh
   profiteth nothing; the words of Christ "are spirit and are life." A
   book written by his own unerring hand, unless protected by a perpetual
   miracle, would have been subject to the same changes and corruptions in
   the hands of fallible transcribers and printers as the books of his
   disciples, and the original autograph would have perished with the
   brittle papyrus. Nor would it have escaped the unmerciful assaults of
   sceptical and infidel critics, and misinterpretations of commentators
   and preachers. He himself was crucified by the hierarchy of his own
   people, whom he came to save. What better fate could have awaited his
   book? Of course, it would have risen from the dead, in spite of the
   doubts and conjectures and falsehoods of unbelieving men; but the same
   is true of the writings of the apostles, though thousands of copies
   have been burned by heathens and false Christians. Thomas might put his
   hand into the wound-prints of his risen Lord; but "Blessed are they
   that have not seen and yet have believed."

   We must believe in the Holy Spirit who lives and moves in the Church
   and is the invisible power behind the written and printed word.

   The form in which the authentic records of Christianity have come down
   to us, with their variations and difficulties, is a constant stimulus
   to study and research and calls into exercise all the intellectual and
   moral faculties of men. Every one must strive after the best
   understanding of the truth with a faithful use of his opportunities and
   privileges, which are multiplying with every generation.

   The New Testament is a revelation of spiritual and eternal truth to
   faith, and faith is the work of the Holy Spirit, though rooted in the
   deepest wants and aspirations of man. It has to fight its way through
   an unbelieving world, and the conflict waxes hotter and hotter as the
   victory comes nearer. For the last half century the apostolic writings
   have been passing through the purgatory of the most scorching criticism
   to which a book can be subjected. The opposition is itself a powerful
   testimony to their vitality and importance.

   There are two kinds of scepticism: one represented by Thomas, honest,
   earnest, seeking and at last finding the truth; the other represented
   by Sadducees and Pontius Pilate, superficial, worldly, frivolous,
   indifferent to truth and ending in despair. With the latter "even the
   gods reason in vain." When it takes the trouble to assail the Bible, it
   deals in sneers and ridicule which admit of no serious answer. The
   roots of infidelity he in the heart and will rather than in the reason
   and intellect, and wilful opposition to the truth is deaf to any
   argument. But honest, truth-loving scepticism always deserves regard
   and sympathy and demands a patient investigation of the real or
   imaginary difficulties which are involved in the problem of the origin
   of Christianity. It may be more useful to the church than an unthinking
   and unreasoning orthodoxy. One of the ablest and purest sceptical
   critics of the century (DeWette) made the sad, but honorable
   confession:


   "I lived in times of doubt and strife,

   When childlike faith was forced to yield;

   I struggled to the end of life,

   Alas! I did not gain the field."

   But he did gain the field, after all, at last; for a few months before
   his death he wrote and published this significant sentence: "I know
   that in no other name can salvation be found, than in the name of Jesus
   Christ the Crucified, and there is nothing higher for mankind than the
   divine humanity (Gottmenschheit) realized in him, and the kingdom of
   God planted by him." Blessed are those that seek the truth, for they
   shall find it.

   The critical and historical rationalism which was born and matured in
   this century in the land of Luther, and has spread in Switzerland,
   France, Holland, England, Scotland, and America, surpasses in depth and
   breadth of learning, as well as in earnestness of spirit, all older
   forms of infidelity and heresy. It is not superficial and frivolous, as
   the rationalism of the eighteenth century; it is not indifferent to
   truth, but intensely interested in ascertaining the real facts, and
   tracing the origin and development of Christianity, as a great
   historical phenomenon. But it arrogantly claims to be the criticism par
   excellence, as the Gnosticism of the ancient church pretended to have
   the monopoly of knowledge. There is a historical, conservative, and
   constructive criticism, as well as an unhistorical, radical, and
   destructive criticism; and the former must win the fight as sure as
   God's truth will outlast all error. So there is a believing and
   Christian Gnosticism as well as an unbelieving and anti- (or pseudo-)
   Christian Gnosticism.

   The negative criticism of the present generation has concentrated its
   forces upon the life of Christ and the apostolic age, and spent an
   astonishing amount of patient research upon the minutest details of its
   history. And its labors have not been in vain; on the contrary, it has
   done a vast amount of good, as well as evil. Its strength lies in the
   investigation of the human and literary aspect of the Bible; its
   weakness in the ignoring of its divine and spiritual character. It
   forms thus the very antipode of the older orthodoxy, which so
   overstrained the theory of inspiration as to reduce the human agency to
   the mechanism of the pen. We must look at both aspects. The Bible is
   the Word of God and the word of holy men of old. It is a revelation of
   man, as well as of God. It reveals man in all his phases of
   development--innocence, fall, redemption--in all the varieties of
   character, from heavenly purity to satanic wickedness, with all his
   virtues and vices, in all his states of experience, and is an
   ever-flowing spring of inspiration to the poet, the artist, the
   historian, and divine. It reflects and perpetuates the mystery of the
   incarnation. It is the word of him who proclaimed himself the Son of
   Man, as well as the Son of God. "Men spake from God, being moved by the
   Holy Spirit." Here all is divine and all is human.

   No doubt the New Testament is the result of a gradual growth and
   conflict of different forces, which were included in the original idea
   of Christianity and were drawn out as it passed from Christ to his
   disciples, from the Jews to the Gentiles, from Jerusalem to Antioch and
   Rome, and as it matured in the mind of the leading apostles. No doubt
   the Gospels and Epistles were written by certain men, at a certain
   time, in a certain place, under certain surroundings, and for definite
   ends; and all these questions are legitimate objects of inquiry and
   eminently deserving of ever-renewed investigation. Many obscure points
   have been cleared up, thanks, in part, to these very critics, who
   intended to destroy, and helped to build up.

   The literary history of the apostolic age, like its missionary
   progress, was guided by a special providence. Christ only finished a
   part of his work while on earth. He pointed his disciples to greater
   works, which they would accomplish in his name and by his power, after
   his resurrection. He promised them his unbroken presence, and the gift
   of the Holy Spirit, who, as the other Advocate, should lead them into
   the whole truth and open to them the understanding of all his words.
   The Acts of the Apostles are a history of the Holy Spirit, or of the
   post-resurrection work of Christ in establishing his kingdom on earth.
   Filled with that Spirit, the apostles and evangelists went forth into a
   hostile world and converted it to Christ by their living word, and they
   continue their conquering march by their written word.

   Unbelieving criticism sees only the outside surface of the greatest
   movement in history, and is blind to the spiritual forces working from
   within or refuses to acknowledge them as truly divine. In like manner,
   the materialistic and atheistic scientists of the age conceive of
   nature's laws without a lawgiver; of a creature without a creator; and
   stop with the effect, without rising to the cause, which alone affords
   a rational explanation of the effect.

   And here we touch upon the deepest spring of all forms of rationalism,
   and upon the gulf which inseparably divides it from supernaturalism. It
   is the opposition to the supernatural and the miraculous. It denies God
   in nature and God in history, and, in its ultimate consequences, it
   denies the very existence of God. Deism and atheism have no place for a
   miracle; but belief in the existence of an Almighty Maker of all things
   visible and invisible, as the ultimate and all-sufficient cause of all
   phenomena in nature and in history, implies the possibility of miracle
   at any time; not, indeed, as a violation of his own laws, but as a
   manifestation of his law-giving and creative power over and above (not
   against) the regular order of events. The reality of the miracle, in
   any particular case, then, becomes a matter of historical
   investigation. It cannot be disposed of by a simple denial from à
   priori philosophical prejudice; but must be fairly examined, and, if
   sufficiently corroborated by external and internal evidence, it must be
   admitted.

   Now, the miracles of Christ cannot be separated from his person and his
   teachings. His words are as marvellous as his deeds; both form a
   harmonious whole, and they stand or fall together. His person is the
   great miracle, and his miracles are simply his natural works. He is as
   much elevated above other men as his words and deeds are above ordinary
   words and deeds. He is separated from all mortals by his absolute
   freedom from sin. He, himself, claims superhuman origin and
   supernatural powers; and to deny them is to make him a liar and
   impostor. It is impossible to maintain his human perfection, which all
   respectable rationalists admit and even emphasize, and yet to refuse
   his testimony concerning himself. The Christ of Strauss and of Renan is
   the most contradictory of all characters; the most incredible of all
   enigmas. There is no possible scientific mediation between a purely
   humanitarian conception of Christ, no matter how high he may be raised
   in the scale of beings, and the faith in Christ as the Son of God, whom
   Christendom has adored from the beginning and still adores as the Lord
   and Saviour of the world.

   Nor can we eliminate the supernatural element from the Apostolic Church
   without destroying its very life and resolving it into a gigantic
   illusion. What becomes of Paul if we deny his conversion, and how shall
   we account for his conversion without the Resurrection and Ascension?
   The greatest of modern sceptics paused at the problem, and felt almost
   forced to admit an actual miracle, as the only rational solution of
   that conversion. The Holy Spirit was the inspiring and propelling power
   of the apostolic age, and made the fishers of Galilee fishers of men.

   A Christian, who has experienced the power of the gospel in his heart,
   can have no difficulty with the supernatural. He is as sure of the
   regenerating and converting agency of the Spirit of God and the saving
   efficacy of Christ as he is of his own natural existence. He has tasted
   the medicine and has been healed. He may say with the man who was born
   blind and made to see: "One thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind,
   now I see." This is a short creed; but stronger than any argument. The
   fortress of personal experience is impregnable; the logic of stubborn
   facts is more cogent than the logic of reason. Every genuine conversion
   from sin to holiness is a psychological miracle, as much so as the
   conversion of Saul of Tarsus.

   The secret or open hostility to the supernatural is the moving spring
   of infidel criticism. We may freely admit that certain difficulties
   about the time and place of composition and other minor details of the
   Gospels and Epistles are not, and perhaps never can be, satisfactorily
   solved; but it is, nevertheless, true that they are far better
   authenticated by internal and external evidence than any books of the
   great Greek and Roman classics, or of Philo and Josephus, which are
   accepted by scholars without a doubt. As early as the middle of the
   second century, that is, fifty years after the death of the Apostle
   John, when yet many of his personal pupils and friends must have been
   living, the four Canonical Gospels, no more and no less, were
   recognized and read in public worship as sacred books, in the churches
   of Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, Italy, and Gaul; and such universal
   acceptance and authority in the face of Jewish and heathen hostility
   and heretical perversion can only be explained on the ground that they
   were known and used long before. Some of them, Matthew and John, were
   quoted and used in the first quarter of the second century by Orthodox
   and Gnostic writers. Every new discovery, as the last book of the
   pseudo-"Clementine Homilies," the "Philosophumena" of Hippolytus, the
   "Diatessaron" of Tatian, and every deeper investigation of the "Gospel
   Memoirs" of Justin Martyr, and the "Gospel" of Marcion in its relation
   to Luke, have strengthened the cause of historical and conservative
   criticism and inflicted bleeding wounds on destructive criticism. If
   quotations from the end of the first and the beginning of the second
   century are very rare, we must remember that we have only a handful of
   literary documents from that period, and that the second generation of
   Christians was not a race of scholars and scribes and critics, but of
   humble, illiterate confessors and martyrs, who still breathed the
   bracing air of the living teaching, and personal reminiscences of the
   apostles and evangelists.

   But the Synoptical Gospels bear the strongest internal marks of having
   been composed before the destruction of Jerusalem (a.d. 70), which is
   therein prophesied by Christ as a future event and as the sign of the
   fast approaching judgment of the world, in a manner that is consistent
   only with such early composition. The Epistle to the Hebrews, likewise,
   was written when the Temple was still standing, and sacrifices were
   offered from day to day. Yet, as this early date is not conceded by
   all, we will leave the Epistle out of view. The Apocalypse of John is
   very confidently assigned to the year 68 or 69 by Baur, Renan, and
   others, who would put the Gospels down to a much later date. They also
   concede the Pauline authorship of the great anti-Judaic Epistles to the
   Galatians, Romans, and Corinthians, and make them the very basis of
   their assaults upon the minor Pauline Epistles and the Acts of the
   Apostles, on the ground of exaggerated or purely imaginary differences.
   Those Epistles of Paul were written twelve or fourteen years before the
   destruction of Jerusalem. This brings us within less than thirty years
   of the resurrection of Christ and the birthday of the church.

   Now, if we confine ourselves to these five books, which the most
   exacting and rigorous criticism admits to be apostolic--the four
   Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse--they alone are sufficient to
   establish the foundation of historical faith; for they confirm by
   direct statement or allusion every important fact and doctrine in the
   gospel history, without referring to the written Gospels. The memory
   and personal experience of the writers--Paul and John--goes back to the
   vision of Damascus, to the scenes of the Resurrection and Crucifixion,
   and the first call of the disciples on the banks of the Jordan and the
   shores of the Lake of Galilee. Criticism must first reason Paul and
   John out of history, or deny that they ever wrote a line, before it can
   expect sensible men to surrender a single chapter of the Gospels.

   Strong as the external evidence is, the internal evidence of the truth
   and credibility of the apostolic writings is still stronger, and may be
   felt to this day by the unlearned as well as the scholar. They widely
   differ in style and spirit from all post-apostolic productions, and
   occupy a conspicuous isolation even among the best of books. This
   position they have occupied for eighteen centuries among the most
   civilized nations of the globe; and from this position they are not
   likely to be deposed.

   We must interpret persons and events not only by themselves, but also
   in the light of subsequent history. "By their fruits ye shall know
   them." Christianity can stand this test better than any other religion,
   and better than any system of philosophy.

   Taking our position at the close of the apostolic age, and looking back
   to its fountain-head and forward to succeeding generations, we cannot
   but be amazed at the magnitude of the effects produced by the brief
   public ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, which sends its blessings through
   centuries as an unbroken and ever-expanding river of life. There is
   absolutely nothing like it in the annals of the race. The Roman empire
   embraced, at the birth of Christ, over one hundred millions of men,
   conquered by force, and, after having persecuted his religion for three
   hundred years, it died away without the possibility of a resurrection.
   The Christian church now numbers four hundred millions, conquered by
   the love of Christ, and is constantly increasing. The first century is
   the life and light of history and the turning point of the ages. If
   ever God revealed himself to man, if ever heaven appeared on earth, it
   was in the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth. He is, beyond any
   shadow of doubt, and by the reluctant consent of sceptics and infidels,
   the wisest of the wise, the purest of the pure, and the mightiest of
   the mighty. His Cross has become the tree of life to all nations; his
   teaching is still the highest standard of religious truth; his example
   the unsurpassed ideal of holiness; the Gospels and Epistles of his
   Galilean disciples are still the book of books, more powerful than all
   the classics of human wisdom and genius. No book has attracted so much
   attention, provoked so much opposition, outlived so many persecutions,
   called forth so much reverence and gratitude, inspired so many noble
   thoughts and deeds, administered so much comfort and peace from the
   cradle to the grave to all classes and conditions of men. It is more
   than a book; it is an institution, an all-pervading omnipresent force,
   a converting, sanctifying, transforming agency; it rules from the
   pulpit and the chair; it presides at the family altar; it is the sacred
   ark of every household, the written conscience of every Christian man,
   the pillar of cloud by day, the pillar of light by night in the
   pilgrimage of life. Mankind is bad enough, and human life dark enough
   with it; but how much worse and how much darker would they be without
   it? Christianity might live without the letter of the New Testament,
   but not without the facts and truths which it records and teaches. Were
   it possible to banish them from the world, the sun of our civilization
   would be extinguished, and mankind left to midnight darkness, with the
   dreary prospect of a dreamless and endless Nirvana.

   But no power on earth or in hell can extinguish that sun. There it
   shines on the horizon, the king of day, obscured at times by clouds
   great or small, but breaking through again and again, and shedding
   light and life from east to west, until the darkest corners of the
   globe shall be illuminated. The past is secure; God will take care of
   the future.

   MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRAEVALEBIT.

       aber unter der herrschaft des gesetzes der immanenten entwicklung
       des menschlichen geistes aus innerweltlichen causalitäten muss die

       objectiv-wirklichen, himmlischen gestalt, die aus ihrer
       transcendenten unsichtbarkeit sich ihm zur erscheinung gebracht
       habe. Aus der wirklichkeit dieser gesehauten gestalt, in welcher er
       den gekreuzigtenJesus erkannte, folgerte auch er, dass der
       kreuzestote zu neuem leben von der allmacht Gottes auferweckt
       worden, aus der gewissheit der auferweckung aber, dass dieser von
       den toten auferweckte der sohn Gottes und der Messias sei. Wie also

       the defence of the Apocalypse as a Johannean production, and
       neutralized the force of the Tübingen assault derived from that

       especially by the weight and candor of Neander, although he felt
       compelled, in self-defence, to reaffirm his doubt as essential to

       abgeschmackt, ja verwerflich zu werden, indem sie die Apostel als
       arme Betrogene, oder gar mit Jesus selber als Betrüger zeigt. Denn
       vom Scheintod hatte man auch damals einen Begriff, und die Lage
       Jesu musste zeigen, dass hier von Auferstehung nicht die Rede war;
       hielt man ihn doch für auferstanden, gab er sich selbst als
       auferstanden, so. fehlte das nüchterne Denken, und hütete er sich

       wiederschien und dass dieses ihr wiedersehen der anfang ihres neuen
       höhern glaubens und alles ihres Christlichen wirkens selbst war. Es
       ist aber ebenso gewiss dass sie ihn nicht wie einen gewöhnlichen
       menschen oder wie einen aus dem grabe aufsteigenden schatten oder
       gespenst wie die sage von solchen meldet, sondern wie den einzigen
       Sohn Gottes, wie ein durchaus schon übermächtiges und
       übermenschliches wesen wiedersahen und sich bei späteren
       zurückerinnerungen nichts anderes denken konnten als dass jeder
       welcher ihn wiederzusehen gewürdigt sei auch sogleich unmittelbar
       seine einzige göttliche würde erkannt und seitdem felsenfest daran
       geglaubt habe. Als den ächten König und Sohn Gottes hatten ihn aber
       die Zwölfe und andre schon im leben zu erkennen gelernt: der
       unterschied ist nur der dass sie ihn jetzt auch nach seiner rein
       göttlichen seite und damit auch als den über den tod siegreichen
       erkannt zu haben sich erinnerten. Zwischen jenem gemeinen schauen
       des irdischen Christus wie er ihnen sowohl bekannt war und diesem
       höhern tieferregten entzückten schauen des himmlischen ist also
       dock ein innerer zusammenhang, so dass sie ihn auch jetzt in diesen
       ersten tagen und wochen nach seinem tode nie als den himmlischen

       Ausnahme von der Regel gekennzeichnet wird.: [5993]1

       Tempel, die Stadt dem Boden gleich, Alles unter dem ernsten
       Gesichtspunkt eines Strafgerichtes Gottes für die dung des

       Geschichtschreiber eine new unbestimmbar grosse Periode der
       Trümmerlage Jerusalemz unter dem ehernen Tritt der Heiden und
       heidnischer Weltzeiten, innerhalb deren er selber schreibt. Unter

       Sorgfalt, die wesentlichen Züge, sogar die Wiederkunft in diesem

       Kunst bewundern, mit welcher der Evangelist die Elemente, welche
       vom Standpunkt der Apokalypse auf den freiern und höhern des
       Evangeliums hinüberleiteten, in sich aufgenommen hat, um die
       Apokalypse zum Evangelium zu vergeistigen. Nur vom Standpunkt dei

       Kreuz Christi schildert; es ist nie bloss ein Verhältniss
       objectiver Theorie, sondern immer zugleich und wesentlich das der
       subjectiven Verbundenheit des innersten Gemüths mit dem
       Gekreuzigten, eine mystische Gemeinschaft mit dem Kreuzestod und

       Denn diese vision ist einer der entscheidendsten punkte für ein
       geschichtliches begreifen des urchristentums. In ihrer genesis ist
       der keim des paulinischen evangelium gegeben. So lange der schein
       nicht aufgehoben ist, dass die empfängnis dieses keims als die
       wirkung einer transcendenten kraft erfolgt sei, besteht über dem
       empfangenen fort und fort der schein des transcendenten. Und die
       kritik am wenigsten darf sich damit beruhigen, dass eine
       transcendenz, eine objectivität, wie sie von ihren gegnern für
       diese vision gefordert wird, von der selbstgewissheit des modernen
       geistes verworfen sei. Denn diese selbstgewissheit kann ihre

     * J'ai traversê dans tous les sens la province évangelique; j'ai
       visitê Jérusalem: [6089]1
     * Je crois le passage sur Jésus authentique. Il est parfaitement dans
       le goût de Joseph, et si cet historian a fait mention de Jésus,
       c'est bien comme cela qu'il a dû en parler. On sent seulement
       qu'une main chrétienne a retouché le morceau, y a ajouté quelques
       mots sans lesquels il eút été presque blasphématoire, a peut-étre

       comme la ville des martyrs, pour jouer un rôle à part dans
       l'histoire du christianisme, et en étre la seconde ville sainte. Ce
       fut la prise de possession de la colline Vatcane par ces
       triomphateurs d'un genre inconnu jusque-là: [6104]1

     * La conversion de Paul, après tout ce qui en a été dit de notre

       traditionnel de ce mot: [6109]1

     * Le même phénomène se retrouve, du reste, dans presque toutes les
       littératures sacrées. Les Védas ont traversé des siècles sans être
       éerits; un homme qui se respectait devait les savoir par coeur.
       Celui qui avait besoin d'un manuscrit pour rêciter ces hymnes
       antiques faisait un aveu d'ignorance; aussi les copies n'en
       ont-elles jamais été estimées. Citer de mémoire la Bible, le Coran,
       est encore de nos jours un point d'honneur pour les 0rientaux:

       siècles, justifiés par les citations des auteurs originaux: [6133]1
     * On l'a trop admiré. Il a de la chaleur: [6134]1
     * Par sa pauvreté humblement supportée, par la douceur de son
       caractère, par l'opposition qu'il faisait aux hypocrites et aux
       prêtres, Hillel fut le vrai maître de Jésus, s'il est permis de
       parler de maître, quand il s'agit d'une si haute originalité.:
       [6135]1
     * Paul clôt l'énumeration des apparitions de Jésus ressuscité aux
       apôtres par celle qui lui a été accordée à lui-méme; il lui
       attribue donc la méme réalité qu'à celles-là, et il la distingue
       ainsi d'une manière tranchée de toutes les visions dont il fut plus
       tard honoré et que mentionnent le livre des Actes, et les épitres.:
       [6136]1
     * Rien de plus tatigant que ses longs récits de miracles et que ces
       discussions, roulant sur des malentendus: [6137]1
     * Rome et la Judie au temps de la chute de Néron (ans 66-72 après

     * Théologie johannique,: [6143]1
     * Tout est possible: [6144]1
     * Une chose hors de doute, c'est que les Actes ont eut le méme auteur
       que le troisiéme évangile et sont une continuation de cet évangile
       ... La parfaite ressemblance du style et des idées fournissent à
       cet égard d'abondantes démonstrations .... Les deux livres réunis
       font un ensemble absolument du mime style, présentant les mémes
       locutions favorites et la méme façon de citer l'écriture.: [6145]1
     * Vie de Jèsus.: [6146]1
     * Vie de Jésus: [6147]1

     * appartient à Marie de, Magdala. Apres Jésus, c'est Marie qui a le
       plus fait pour la fondation du christianisme. L'ombre créée par les
       sens délicats de Madeleine plane encore sur le monde .... Sa grande
       affirmation de femme: 'Il est resuscité!' a été la base de la foi
       de l'humanité.": [6156]1
     * aux derniers chapitres,: [6157]1
     * beau jeune homme: [6158]1
     * c'est-à-dire un événement qui arrête ou change violemment le cours
       naturel des choses, un effet sans autre cause que l'intervention
       arbitraire et immédiate de Dieu: [6159]1
     * cilice,: [6160]1
     * dans les premières heures qui suivirent sa mort, n'avaient à cet
       égard aucune espérance: [6161]1
     * des petits et des humbles introduits dans le royaume de Dieu. Un
       esprit de sainte enfance, de joie, de ferveur: [6162]1
     * doux Galilèen: [6163]1
     * esprit large et doux, sage, modéré, sobre et raisonnable dans
       l'irrationnel. Ses exagérations, ses invraisemblances: [6164]1
     * est un fait accompli avant la fin du premier. Dans l'èpître de
       Clément Romain: [6165]1
     * et cette limpidité de narration qui fait le charme des évangélistes
       primitifs! Ceux-ci n'ont pas besoin de répéter sans cesse que ce
       qu'ils racontent est vrai. Leur sincérité, inconsciente de
       l'objection, n'a pas cette soif fébrile d'attestations répétéesqui
       montre que l'incrédulité, le doute, ont déjà commencé: [6166]1
     * etc., ce n'est pas encore l'épiscopat, c'est le presbytérat qui est
       en cause. On n'y trouve pas trace d'un 'presbyteros''supérieur aux
       autres et devant détrôner les autres. Mais l'auteur proclame
       hautement que le presbytérat, to clergé, est antérieur au peuple:
       [6167]1
     * f-d'oeuvre,: [6168]1
     * i il n'y a que le sceptique qui écrive l'histoire: [6169]1
     * il écrit, il montre une vraie entente de la composition. Son livre
       est un beau récit bien suivi, à la fois hébraîque et hellénique,
       joignant l'émotion du drama à la sérènité de l'idylle. Tout y rit,
       tout y pleure, tout y chante; partout des larmes et des cantiques;
       c'est l'hymne du peuple nouveau: [6170]1
     * ils font violence à toute réalité: [6171]1
     * ils sont tristes et abattus; l'espoir qu'ils avaient eu de le voir
       realiser le salut d'Israël est convaincu de vanité: [6172]1
     * le sentiment évangélique dans son originalité première répandent
       sur toute la légende une teinte d'une incomparable douceur. On ne
       fut jamais moins sectaire. Pas un reproche, pas un mot dur pour le
       vieux peuple exclu; son exclusion ne le punit-elle pas assez ?
       C'est le plus beau livre qu'il y ait. Le plaisir que l'auteur dut
       avoir à l'écrire ne sera jamais suffisamment compris: [6173]1
     * nul endroit du monde ne fut si bien fait pour les rêves de l'absolu
       bonheur: [6174]1
     * où les adversaires de Jésus jouent le rôle d'idiots. Combien:
       [6175]1
     * on dirait des hommes qui ont perdu une grande et chère illusion.
       Mais l' enthousiasme et l'amour ne connaissent par les situations
       sans issue. Ils se jouentde l'impossible, et plutot que d'abdiquer
       l'espérance: [6176]1
     * on dirait qu'il a peur de n'étre pas cru, et qu'il cherche: [6177]1
     * parfois une sorte de sublimité, mais quelque chose d'enflé, de
       faux, d'obsur. La naïveté manque tout à fait. L'auteur ne raconte
       pas; il démontre: [6178]1
     * parlait comme le veut Matthieu, il n'a pu parler comme le veut
       Jean: [6179]1
     * pathos verbeux nous préférons le doux style, tout hébreu encore, du
       Discours sur la montagne: [6180]1
     * pp. 477 sqq. He changed his view again in his L'église chrétienne,:
       [6181]1
     * presbyteri: [6182]1
     * reëchoes the Tübingen: [6183]1
     * rendue responsable de tout le sang versé, devint comme Babylone une
       sorte de ville sacramentelle et symbolique.: [6184]1
     * secs de Marc. Luc fait bien plus: [6185]1
     * ses inconséquences tiennent à la nature même de la parabole et en
       font le charme. Matthieu arrondit les contours: [6186]1
     * sont une histoire dogmatique, arrangée pour appuyer les doctrines
       orthodoxes du temps ou inculquer les idées qui souriaíent le plus à
       la pieté de l'auteur.: [6187]1
     * soyez de bons banquiers: [6188]1
     * surprendre la religion de son lecteur par des affirmations pleines
       d'emphase.: [6189]1
     * un esprit prodigieusement déclamatoire, une mauvaise nature,
       hypocrite, légère, vaniteuse; un composé incroyable d'intelligence
       fausse, de méchanceté profonde, d'égoïsme atroce et sournois, avee
       des raffinements inouïs de subtilité: [6190]1
