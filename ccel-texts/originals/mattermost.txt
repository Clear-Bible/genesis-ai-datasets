PREFACE

   I HAVE ventured to call these devotional papers by the general title,
   "Things That Matter Most," for, although they are concerned with many
   themes, I think that in every instance, we come face to face with some
   supreme interest of the soul. The mountains are never below the
   horizon: they are always in sight, and they dominate the plains.

   It is surely well in these days of incessant movement, movement which
   so frequently means strain rather than strength, that we have
   interludes when the soul can correct her conscious and unconscious
   wanderings by the contemplation of the serene and majestic things of
   God. It is in the ministry of these interludes that these meditations
   are now published, and I heartily hope that in this way they may be
   helpful to those who read them.

THE ILLIMITABLE LOVE OF GOD

   WHAT is the biggest thing on which the human mind can be exercised? In
   what can we most easily lose ourselves in the overwhelming sense of the
   immeasurable? There are the vast lone spaces of the stellar fields,
   peopled with countless worlds, crossed by mysterious highways, with
   stars as the pilgrims, ever moving on their unknown journeyings. We can
   lose ourselves there. There is "the dark backward and abysm of time,"
   opening door after door in ever-receding epochs, back through twilight
   and dawn into the primeval darkness, where the inquisitive mind falters
   and faints. And we can lose ourselves there. There is the appalling
   wilderness of human need, beginning from my own life, with its taint of
   blood, its defect of faculty, its dreary gap in circumstance and
   condition, and repeated in every other life in every street, in every
   city and village and country throughout the inhabited world. And we can
   lose ourselves there. And then there is the deadly, ubiquitous presence
   of human sin, in all its chameleon forms--well-dressed, ill-dressed,
   blazing in passion, mincing in vanity, and freezing in moral
   indifference and unbelief. All these are stupendous themes, and the
   mind that ventures upon them is like the dove that ventured upon the
   waste of waters, and, soon growing weary of wing, returned to the place
   of its rest. But there is something more majestic than the heavens,
   more wonderful than the far, mysterious vistas of time, more pervasive
   than human need, and more abounding than human sin. The biggest thing
   with which the mind can cope is the infinite love of God; and all our
   sanctified powers, and all the ministries of holy fellowship, and all
   the explorations of eternity will never reach a limit in its
   unsearchable wealth. The biggest thing you and I will ever know is the
   love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord. There will always be "a region
   beyond," and for the already wondering eyes there will always be a new
   surprise: "The height, and depth, and length, and breadth, and to know
   the love of God, which passeth knowledge."

   1. Let us reverently gaze into the height of the love of God. In love
   the scale of height is measured by the degree of purity. The height in
   the scale of diamonds is determined by an analogous standard. A diamond
   is of the "first water" when it is without flaw or tint of any kind.
   And love is lofty in proportion to its brilliance. Love can be
   deteriorated and degraded by the tint of jealousy. It can be debased by
   the tint of envy. It can be vulgarized by a strain of carnal passion.
   These earthly elements may be mixed with the heavenly substance, and
   its spiritual value is reduced. So that the first test to apply to any
   love is the test of purity, which is the test of height, the test as to
   how far it is sublimated, and separated from selfish and fleshly
   ingredients which dim and spoil its lustre.

   Now it is here that the Scriptures begin in their revelation of the
   love of God. They begin with its brilliance, its holiness. "In Him is
   no darkness at all!" How would that be as a description of a diamond?
   "No darkness at all!" Nothing sinful in His love! But more than that.
   Nothing shady in it, nothing questionable: nothing compromising or
   morally indifferent! No darkness at all; no blackness of faithlessness;
   no twilight of forgetfulness; "no night there!"

   And thus it is that, when the Book guides us in the contemplation of
   the eternal love, it first of all leads us into the contemplation of
   the eternal light. Always and everywhere this is where we begin. If I
   listen to a psalmist, he leads me into the holy place: "Exalt the Lord
   our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy."
   If I listen to a prophet, I am led into the same sacred precincts: "The
   high and lofty One whose name is holy." If I listen to the mystic
   seraphim of the Old Testament, I hear them cry one to another, "Holy,
   holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts." If I listen to the songs of the
   Apocalypse, I find them burdened with the same theme: "They rest not
   day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty." If I
   reverently listen to the Master in His secret communion with the
   Unseen, I hear Him say, "Holy Father." And if I listen to the prayer
   which He Himself teaches me to pray, I am led immediately to the holy
   glory of the Lord: "Our Father . . . hallowed be Thy name." Always and
   everywhere this is the beginning of our contemplation. We are led away
   into the light, into the unshadowed brilliance, into the holiness of
   God. If, therefore, God's love be symbolized by a mountain, its heights
   will be clothed in the dazzling whiteness of the everlasting snow.
   Love's heights are found in love's holiness. "God is light," "God is
   truth," "God is love."

   From this primary teaching I wish to adduce two inferences. And the
   first is this. The force of love always depends upon its height. We
   find the analogy in water. The force of falling water is determined by
   its height. In an English home, if your shower-bath is lazy and
   loitering, chilling you rather than bracing you, your remedy is to
   raise your cistern, and in the increased height you will get the
   requisite tingle. The tonic is born in loftiness. It is even so with
   love. There is a type of love which has no vigour because it has no
   height. It is a weak, sickly sentiment which just crawls about you. It
   is low, and therefore it has no enlivening force. It is mixed with
   earthly elements, and therefore it has no heavenly quickening. It
   enervates, it does not invigorate. The more holy love is, the higher it
   is, and the more fraught it is with vitality. How, then, must it be
   with the love of God? Born in holiness, it has power enough to waken
   the dead. Have you seen an Alpine river, born amid the snows, and
   rolling gloriously through the vale? That is the figure we need: "And I
   saw a river of water of life, clear as crystal," proceeding from "the
   great white throne," out of the unshadowed depths of eternal holiness.
   "There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God,"
   and the holy power of that river is determined by the holy heights in
   which it is born.

   And the second inference is this, that the ultimate ministry and goal
   of love is also determined by the height of its holiness. Once again
   seek your analogy in water. Water rises no higher than its source.
   Water can lift no higher than its source. It is even so with love. Our
   love can never raise a loved one higher than the love itself. There are
   aspects of that law which are altogether staggering. Take the love of a
   parent for his child. Our own tainted love will not lift our child into
   purity. Our own jealous love will not lift our child into an
   unembittered disposition. Our own envious love will not lift our child
   into moral serenity. Our love will not lift above its own level. That
   is the solemn responsibility of a lover, that if the love be low it
   will scarcely lift the beloved one above the plains. If we want to lift
   higher we must heighten our love. How, then, is it with the love of
   God? His love, so glorious in holiness, can raise to its own level, and
   lift us into "heavenly places in Christ Jesus." "They shall sit with Me
   on My throne." "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." God's love imparts its own loveliness, until one day
   we too shall be "altogether lovely."

   From the supreme height of the fells, on the island of Arran, there
   comes rolling down the granite slopes a gloriously alive and vitalizing
   stream. They call it "The White Water," and it is well named. It gleams
   on the slopes like the whitest foam. Out at sea, when everything else
   was obscure, I could see the white water running on its ceaseless
   errand. And oh! the loveliness of its bequests, and the unutterable
   beauty of its dells and glens! It feeds the bracken, it nourishes the
   stalwart heather, it moistens the retiring fern. The White Water endows
   its haunts with its own loveliness. And the white water of the eternal
   love, ceaselessly flowing from the holy heart of God, brings with it
   power to make everything lovely, and at last to present everything
   spotless before the throne.

   2. Let us gaze into its depths. Let me link together detached sentences
   from the Word, that in their associations we may discern what is meant
   by the depth of the love of God. "The high and lofty one whose tame is
   holy." . . . "He is gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner!"
   "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands,
   and that He was come from God, and went to God . . . began to wash the
   disciples' feet." "And one cried with another, saying, Holy, holy, holy
   is the Lord!" . . . "Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more!"
   All these are suggestive of what is meant by the love-depths of our
   God. And on these I want to build this teaching, that it is only the
   really lofty that can truly reach the really deep. The arm that can
   reach far upward is the only arm that can reach far downward. It is
   only holy love that can deal with humanity's deepest needs. A low love
   has no depths of service. Low love is a thing of compromise, and has no
   dealings with extremes, whether of holiness or of sin. Pharisaic love
   had no height. "I thank Thee I am not as other men are." That is not
   loftiness: it is superciliousness; it is not the vision from the
   snow-white hills. And because Pharisaic love had no height, it had no
   corresponding depth; and when the Pharisee saw One descending into the
   deep pits of human need, he cried in self-respecting amazement, "He
   eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners!" Holy love, crystalline
   love, goes down and down into human necessity, and is not afraid of the
   taint. Sunbeams can move among sewage and catch no defilement. The
   brilliant, holy love of God ministers in the deepest depths of human
   need.

   God's love is deeper than human sorrow, and how deep that is my
   appointed lot gives me daily and deepening experience. But drop your
   plummet-line into the deepest sea of sorrow, and at the end of all your
   soundings "underneath are the everlasting arms." God's love is deeper
   than death, and there are multitudes who know how deep grim death can
   be. "Just twelve months ago," said a near friend of mine a week or two
   ago, "I dug a deep grave!" Aye, and I know it was deep enough. But the
   grave-digger's spade cannot get beneath our Father's love. God's love
   is deeper than the deepest grave you ever dug! "And entering into the
   sepulchre they saw an angel," and you can never dig into any dreary,
   dreary dwelling of death which is beyond the reach of those white-robed
   messengers of eternal love. Yes, God's love is deeper than death. "O
   death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"

   And God's love is deeper than sin. One night, when I was recently
   crossing the Atlantic, an officer of our boat told me that we had just
   passed over the spot where the Titanic went down. And I thought of all
   that life and wreckage beyond the power of man to recover and redeem.
   And I thought of the great bed of the deep sea, with all its held
   treasure, too far down for man to reach and restore. "Too far down!"
   And then I thought of all the human wreckage engulfed and sunk in
   oceanic depths of nameless sin. Too far gone! For what? Too far down!
   For what? Not too far down for the love of God! Listen to this: "He
   descended into hell," and He will descend again if you are there. "If I
   make my bed in hell, Thou art there." "Where sin abounded, grace did
   much more abound." "He bore our sin"; then He got beneath it; down to
   it and beneath it; and there is no human wreckage, lying in the ooze of
   the deepest sea of iniquity, that His deep love cannot reach and
   redeem. What a Gospel! However far down, God's love can get beneath it!


   Stronger His love than death or hell,

   Its riches are unsearchable:

   The first-born sons of light

   Desire in vain its depths to see,

   They cannot tell the mystery,

   The length, and breadth, and height!

   3. Let us gaze into its breadth. Here again. I want to say that the
   breadth of love is determined by its height. Low love is always very
   confined and exclusive. Lofty love is liberal and expansive. Low love
   is like a lake; lofty love is like a river. We can imprison a lake
   within our own estate; we cannot imprison a river. It will be out, and
   about, and on! And sometimes we foolishly try to imprison the love of
   God. "We make His love too narrow by false limits of our own." Men have
   tried to appoint social limits, and national limits, and ecclesiastical
   limits, and credal limits. We may as well try to break up the sea into
   allotments as to "peg out" the love of God. The love of God is as broad
   as the race, and nowhere is there a single man in any clime, or of any
   colour, in congested city, in tropical jungle, or on a lonely
   frontier-line where a pioneer has built himself a primitive
   home--nowhere is there a single man, woman, or child who is orphaned of
   a place in the eternal Father's heart. "If He lose one He goeth out!" .
   . . O love of God, how broad!

   4. And what of its length? There is no end to it. To what length will
   it not go? "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
   life for his friends." To that length! "Becoming obedient unto death,
   even the death of the cross!" To that length! "Goeth after that which
   is lost until He find it." To that length! God's love is as long as the
   longest road. God's love is as long as the longest day. God's love is
   as long as the longest night. God's love is as long as life. God's love
   is as long as eternity. "I have loved thee with an everlasting love."
   "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." "Love never faileth."

LOVERS OF GOD

   I WANT to guide the thoughts of my readers to the soul's love for the
   Lord, and the fitting words must be pure as light and simple as
   childhood. Not that the subject is simple. There is no subject more
   delicate, more intangible, more elusive. It is ever the simplicities
   that most easily evade our intellectual grasp. What more simple than
   the love of a little child, and yet how spiritual, and therefore how
   infinite! And so it is when we come to a theme like the soul's love for
   our God. We feel awkward and clumsy, as if we were dealing with tender
   and sacred refinements, and we lack the requisite softness of hand and
   foot. We have not the delicacy of soul for approaching the exquisitely
   shy and retiring genius; and even if we see her beauties and her
   manners afar off, we have no fitting speech wherewith to describe her
   charms. For themes of this kind require not only very rare and special
   powers of vision, they require an almost equally rare and unique
   vocabulary. If we are going to speak about the love of the saints,
   those to whom we speak must not be made to gather like students in a
   herbalist's museum; they must feel as if they were out in the sunshine,
   among all sweet and natural things, amid enticing perfumes and lovely
   hues. They must not be as though they were studying the laws of physics
   in the classroom, but as though they were basking in the cheery heat
   rays of the enlivening sun. In our time there have been two men who
   could move about this field of the soul's love with the incomparable
   ease of master-lovers--Spurgeon and Newman, and I always repair to them
   when I want to put a bit of edge on my own sadly blunt and ineffective
   blade. Both were deeply intimate with the delicate ways of the soul,
   and with the love-songs of the soul; so much so that when they began to
   speak about it the warm, luscious words and phrases of the Song of
   Solomon became their spontaneous ministers of expression.

   The dictionary cannot help us in our quest. The dictionary attempts its
   definition, but when the definition has been given we feel it is a
   birdless cage, and the sweet, living songster is not there. Here is
   what the dictionary says: "Love, an affection of the mind excited by
   qualities in an object which are capable of communicating pleasure."
   There you have it! But does any young lover or old lover recognize the
   withered thing? It is not only withered--it is imperfect and broken. I
   think we must admit that definitions do not take us very far. To try to
   put love in a phrase is like taking a bit of tender seaweed out of the
   water; it becomes featureless mush in the hand.

   When I turn to the New Testament no definition of love is given.
   Everywhere there are signs of love's presence, and she is always
   engaged in ennobling and beautifying service. Her works are manifest,
   but the worker herself is elusive. Where she moves there is
   indescribable energy; there are powerful ministries of purity, and
   diverse experiences are drilled to a common and beneficent end.
   Everywhere wildernesses become gardens, and deserts are rejoicing and
   blossoming as the rose. But one thing is said, and said very clearly,
   and it is this--the way to love our fellows is by becoming lovers of
   God. "The first of all commandments is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
   God." Everywhere this is taught--love for God is the secret of a large,
   beneficent, and receptive humanity. How, then, can we become "lovers of
   God"?

   First of all, we must consort with the God we desire to love. We must
   bring our minds to bear upon Him. Love is not born where there has been
   no communion. There must be association and fellowship. I know that
   there is "love at first sight." Yes, at a glance the soul leaps to its
   other half, and completes a union appointed in the deep purpose of God.
   And I know there is "love at first sight" with Christ. It is even so
   with multitudes of little children. It is even so with older people;
   the road of their life has suddenly swerved, circumstances have brought
   their souls to a new angle, and there He stood, and their soul was in
   love with Him! But even this first-sight love needs the sustenance of
   careful communion. That is just what so many of us deny our souls. We
   do not give ourselves time. We must bring back something of the
   quietness of the cloisters into our own turbulent life. We must recover
   something of the seclusion of the monastery, the ministry of fruitful
   solitude. We must make space to contemplate the glory of the Lord, and
   especially those characteristics of the Divine life which are fitted to
   constrain our souls into strong and tender devotion. Says St. Francis:
   "The death and passion of our Lord is the gentlest and, at the same
   time, the strongest motive which can animate our hearts in this mortal
   life; and it is quite true that the mystical bees make their most
   excellent honey in the wounds of the lion of the tribe of Judah, who
   was killed, shattered, and rent on Calvary. . . . Mount Calvary is the
   mount of Divine love." But the communion must be wider than this. Let
   me give another quotation from another of the old mystics: "Have the
   Lord devoutly before the eyes of your mind, in His behaviour and in His
   ways, as when He is with His disciples, and when He is with sinners,
   . . . setting forth, to thyself in thy heart His ways and His doings;
   how humbly He bore Himself among men, how tenderly among His disciples,
   how pitiful He was to the poor, how He despised none nor shrank from
   them, not even from the leper; how patient under insult; how
   compassionate He was to the afflicted; how He despised not sinners; how
   patient He was of toil and of want." But our meditation upon these high
   things must be real meditation, the meditation that deepens into
   contemplation, and absorbs and possesses the glory. Our souls must gaze
   upon the glory until something of the sense of sacred ownership steals
   upon them. Political economists have recently been saying very much
   about "the magic of property." The phrase suggests the new and deeper
   interest we have in things when they become our very own. And when we
   begin to even faintly realize that God has given Himself to us, and we
   can truly and reverently use the words "Our Father," "Our Saviour,"
   life becomes the home of wondrous joy and inspiration. "He loved me,
   and gave Himself for me."

   And, in the second place, we must consort with them that are lovers
   already. It is well that this should be through personal intercourse,
   if such happy privilege come our way. But if this immediate fellowship
   be denied us, let us seek their company through the blessed communion
   of books. Let me name one or two of these great lovers of God, and
   quote a few of the love phrases by which they describe their high
   communion. Let us make friends with John Woolman, and hear his speech
   laden with phrases of this kind: "A motion of love," a "fresh and
   heavenly opening," "the enlargement of gospel love," "a love clothes me
   while I write which is superior to all expression," "the
   heart-tendering friendship of the Lord," "the descendings of the
   heavenly dew." And let us make friends with Samuel Rutherford. I might
   quote nearly everything he has written. Let this suffice: "Christ
   enquired not, When He began to love me, whether I was fair or black.
   . . . He loved me before the time I knew; but now I have the flower of
   His love; His love is come to a fair bloom; like a young rose opened up
   out of the green leaves, and it casteth a strong and fragrant smell."
   "If I had vessels I might fill them; but my old, riven, and running-out
   dish, even when I am at the well, can bring little away. . . . How
   little of the sea can a child carry in its hand! As little do I take
   away of my great sea, my boundless and running-over Christ Jesus."
   Would it not be a good thing for us to drop some of our reading to
   spend an hour in communions like these? And then let us seek the
   company of Andrew Bonar: "I felt something of that word," "my soul
   longeth, yea, even fainteth," "and I lay down this night intensely
   desiring to feel constrained by the love of Christ." "I have been
   getting remarkable glimpses of Divine love in answer to earnest prayer
   that I might know the love that passeth knowledge." And I feel I must
   give my readers a little extract from one of this great lover's
   prayers: "As we get into the enjoyment of Thy love may we find that we
   need scarcely any other heaven, either here or hereafter, only more of
   this love and the continuance of it." And we must make friends with
   Horace Bushnell, a man of the most masculine intellect, and yet with
   one of the tenderest hearts I know in devotional literature. Read these
   words, written on the shores of Lake Waramaug, in the evening of his
   life: "The question has not been whether I could somehow get
   nearer--nearer, my God, to Thee; but as if He had come out Himself just
   near enough, and left me nothing but to stand still and see the
   salvation; no excitement, no stress, but an amazing beatific
   tranquillity. I never thought I could possess God so completely." "God
   comes to me--so great, benignant, pure, and radiant. What a wonder is
   God! What a glory for us to possess Him! "Is there any wonder that
   these were among his last words: "Well now, I am going home, and I say,
   the Lord be with you, and sin grace, and peace, and love; and that is
   the way I have come along home."

   There are many other great lovers whose names might have been
   mentioned, and whose friendship it would be well for us to cultivate.
   The doors of their hearts are always open, and their fellowship is
   always ready. But these will suffice. Let me mention a third method by
   which we shall be helped to become lovers of God. I think we ought to
   sing the songs of the great lovers, songs that will create and nurse
   kindred dispositions in ourselves. I mean songs of this kind: "O love
   that will not let me go"; "O love of God, how strong and true"; "Jesus,
   the very thought of Thee"; "Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts"; "Let all
   men know that all men move under a canopy of love." Songs of this
   loveful, soaring kind will lift our souls to heaven's gate. The
   ministry of the lovers' songs is not fully appreciated in the Christian
   life or they would more frequently be upon our lips. Bird trainers
   train their little choristers to sing through the medium of other birds
   whose song is rich and full. And we, too, can train ourselves to become
   lovers of God by singing the songs of those whose love is passionate
   and matured.

  FORGETTING GOD

   THERE is one word of God which runs through the Scriptures like a sad
   and poignant refrain, "My people have forgotten Me." "Forgotten" is an
   intense and awful word. It surely expresses the final issue in human
   alienation from the Divine. Open and deliberate revolt against God
   shows, at any rate, some respect to His power. And even formal prayer,
   empty though it be, offers some recognition of God's existence. But to
   forget Him, to live and plan and work as though He were not, to dismiss
   Him as insignificant--this is surely the last expression of a separated
   life. People are never really dead so long as they are remembered. The
   real death is to be forgotten. How, then, do we come to forget God? In
   what sort of conditions is this appalling forgetfulness brought about?
   I wish to quote two or three descriptive words from the Scriptures in
   which I think some of these cases are described.

   "Afraid of a man that shall die, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker."
   The fear of man destroys the nobler fear of God. I suppose that one may
   say that two commanding fears cannot occupy the soul at one and the
   same time. One fear can drive out another. The fear that is created by
   the cracking of a whip can drive out the fear which possesses a shying
   horse when he sees some unfamiliar object upon the road. If a fire
   break out on a cold wintry night, the fear of the flames can drive out
   of the soul the fear of the frost. It seems as though one fear draws to
   itself the energies of the mind, and other fears are left with no
   sustenance. A big tree in a garden-bed sucks into its fibres the juices
   of the soil for many yards around, and other growths are starved, and
   they wither and die.

   So it is with "the fear of man." It drains to itself the mental energy
   and devotion which ought to feed the fear of God. A politician who is
   moved by fear of man, and who tacks and trims to avoid his hostility,
   can never retain an efficient thought of God. So it is with a minister
   who is afraid of man; his mind is not filled with a vision of "the Lord
   high and lifted up." But, indeed, the same is true of anybody. If the
   barometer we consult for our guidance is the opinion and conventions of
   man, God Himself will be nothing. If we are always consulting man,
   moved and governed by his expediencies, God will vanish away. "The fear
   of man is a snare," and the power of the snare is found in its
   fascination to allure our minds from the Lord of Hosts. "Afraid of a
   man that shall die, and forget-test the Lord thy Maker."

   And here is another type from the portrait gallery of the Bible. "Thou
   hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of
   the Rock of thy strength." Here is a forgetfulness that is born when we
   have recovered from some weakness. Pride of strength makes us forget
   the rock out of which we were hewn. This is a most common and insidious
   peril. Our weakness helps our remembrance of God; our strength is the
   friend of forgetfulness. Perhaps this is most apparent in our physical
   weakness. In our weakness we remember the Lord, and the dim things of
   the unseen come clearly into view. But when our strength is regained
   the vivid vision fades again, and is sometimes entirely lost. And so
   our strength is really our drug. It is an opiate which ministers to
   spiritual forgetfulness. And so it is with every kind of strength.
   Frailty in any direction makes us lean upon the power of the Almighty,
   and in every frailty our remembrance of Him is keen and clear. But our
   strength helps to create a feeling of independence, and we become
   unmindful of our God. And therefore it is that a man who never knows
   weakness has a stupendous task in maintaining communion with God.
   People who never know what it is to be ill have so many more barriers
   to overcome in their fellowship with the Unseen.

   And here is a third Scriptural type of spiritual forgetfulness. "They
   have gone from mountain to hill, and have forgotten their
   resting-places." It is the figure of a flock of wandering sheep roaming
   away over the distant hills and mountains. They have gone from one
   place to another, and in the range of their goings have forgotten their
   place of rest. Their very vagrancy has made them insensible to their
   real home. That is to say, their vagrancy has induced forgetfulness.

   Now I think this word is very descriptive of much of our modern life.
   It is a vagrancy rather than a crusade. We go from "mountain to hill,"
   and from hill to mountain. We are always on the move. We are for ever
   seeking something else and never finding satisfaction. We get weary and
   tired with one thing and we trudge to another! We are here, there, and
   yonder, and our lives become jaded and stale. But the extraordinary
   thing is that in all our goings we forget our resting-place. "Return
   unto thy rest, O my soul." Yes, but we turn anywhere and everywhere
   rather than to this. Our lives can become so vagrant that God is exiled
   from our minds. It seems as though there is something in vagrancy that
   stupefies the soul, and renders us insensitive to our true home and
   rest in God.

   When I first came to New York, during the first few months of my
   ministry, .I was continually asked by people, "Have you got into the
   whirl?" The very phrase seems so far removed from the words of the
   psalmist, "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me
   beside the still waters." Not that the psalmist luxuriated in
   indolence, or spent his days in the fatness of ease; the rest was only
   preparative to a march. "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness."
   But from the march he returned to his resting-place. But we can be
   caught in such a whirl in our modern life that we just rush from one
   thing to another, and we forget the glorious rest that is ours in God.
   I think the enemy of our souls must love to get us into a whirl! If
   once we are dizzied with sensations we are likely to lose the thought
   of God. "They have gone from the mountain to the hill, and have
   forgotten their resting-place."

   Let me give one further example from the Word of God. "According to
   their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart
   was exalted; therefore have they forgotten Me." Here is a rich
   pasturage, and in the enjoyment of it there is born the spirit of
   forgetfulness. And surely this is the stupefaction of abundance. In
   Southern France, where attar of roses is distilled, a very curious
   ailment imperils the workers. The very abundance of the rose-leaves
   induces a sort of sleeping-sickness. And surely it is even so in the
   abundances that are sometimes given to man. They are prone to sink him
   into the sleep of spiritual forgetfulness.

   A man's devotion is apt to dwindle as he becomes more successful. Our
   piety does not keep pace with our purse. Absorption in bounty makes us
   forgetful of the Giver. We can be so concerned in the pasturage that
   the Shepherd is forgotten. Our very fulness is apt to become our foe.
   Our clearest visions are given us in the winter-time when nature is
   scanty and poor. The fulness of the leaf blocks the outlook and the
   distance is hid. And the summer-time of life, when leaves and flowers
   are plentiful, is apt to bring a veil. And the very plentifulness
   impedes our communion.

   These are some of the types of forgetfulness which are mentioned and
   described in the Word of God. Is there any help for us? There is a very
   gracious promise of the Master in which I think all these perils are
   anticipated, and in the strength of which they can be met and overcome:
   "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
   remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." Here is the promise of a
   gracious minister to the memory, strengthening it in its hold upon the
   unseen. I suppose that one of the most urgent needs of the common life
   is the sanctification of the memory. If the memory were to be really
   hallowed it would forget many things which it now remembers, and it
   would certainly remember many things which it now forgets. We are apt
   to retain worthless things, and destructive things, things that ought
   to have been dropped and buried and left in their graves in past years.
   But we carry them with us to our undoing. The ministry of the Holy
   Spirit will deal with this unwise retention, and will make a memory
   leaky where it is wise for it to lose. But, more than that, it will
   strengthen its powers of spiritual comprehension, and will enable it to
   keep hold of the unseen and the eternal. What should I most like to
   remember? I should like to remember with unfailing constancy the
   glorious, holy Being of the eternal God. I should like to remember the
   unspeakable ministry of His grace, which worked in my redemption in
   Christ Jesus, my Lord. I should like to remember the benefits of His
   daily providence which shine along my road in unfailing succession. I
   should like to remember the eternal significance of transient events,
   and hold the lessons of yesterday's happenings to guide me in my march
   to-day. And when new occasions and new duties arise, and I am face to
   face with novel circumstances, I should like to be reminded of those
   words of the Lord Jesus which would give me the needful illumination:
   "He shall bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said
   unto you."

SPIRITUAL ABILITIES

   THE apostolic life abounds in suggestions of power. It is not only that
   there is power in some particular direction, there is basal executive
   force which gives impetus to everything. The life is filled with "go"
   and "drive" and strength of character and conduct. Power resides behind
   every faculty, and every disposition, and every form of service. The
   life is efficient and effective. It is as though a man had a fine
   equipment of tools, but his hand is weak and trembling, and suddenly
   there is given to him a mighty strength of grip, and he is able to
   seize upon every tool and make it accomplish its appointed purpose. "Ye
   shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you," and that
   energy empowered everything, and gave intensity and strength in every
   exercise of the apostle's life. Let us look at one or two directions in
   which this holy power was revealed.

   The apostolic life was distinguished by the strength of its
   relationship to God. It was powerful in its ability to believe. We can
   do nothing more vital to any man than to encourage and strengthen his
   finest faith. When our faith in the Highest is limp and uncertain
   everything lacks assurance. When there is lameness in the movements of
   the spirit our conduct can never be firm. And therefore did the Holy
   Spirit energize the early apostles in their supreme relationships, and
   steadied them in their faith. Now, faith is first of all an attitude
   and then an act. It is primarily a spiritual posture which reveals
   itself in moral obedience. And to be rich in faith is to possess a
   poise of soul which steadily contemplates and rests in the love of God,
   in sunshine and in shower, and through all the changing seasons and
   temperatures of our years. When the soul is thus quietly steadied in
   this spiritual assurance, its faith is expressed in manifold holy .
   ministries of hope and love. This ability of faith is one of the
   radiant characteristics of the early Church, and it was the creation of
   the Holy Ghost.

   But just as apostolic life was empowered in its relationship to God, so
   was it quietly empowered in its resistances to the enemy of God. There
   are two phrases used by the Apostle Paul, in which this sovereign
   ability is described, "able to resist the wiles," "able to quench the
   darts." I do not know any third way in which the enemy of God
   approaches the souls of men. He draws near to us in wiles, he dresses
   himself in all kinds of flattering guises, he exercises himself in
   deceitful mimicries, he uses glosses innumerable. He disguises the ugly
   by throwing about it a seductive limelight. He hides his
   destructiveness in bowers of roses. The Boers used to send their
   ammunition about in piano cases; and this is a fitting symbol of many
   of the stratagems of our foe. He comes to us as an angel of light,
   hiding the lightning which is his peculiar equipment. He makes the
   broad way fascinating, while the narrow way often appears repellent.
   The entrance to the broad way is marked by a glittering crown, while a
   heavy cross is hidden not far away. The entrance to the narrow way is
   marked by a cross, but the crown of life is not far away.

   And so, all through the generations, this wily antagonist has been
   seeking to ensnare the children of God. He uses attractive euphemisms.
   He deceives us by grand speech. He makes us think we are striding out
   in glorious liberty when we are really moving in servitude. Now, one of
   the great distinctions of apostolic life was the power to discern and
   resist the insidiousness of the foe. Their eyes were anointed with
   grace, and they were able to pierce the mere appearance of things and
   to discriminate between the holy and the profane. They could
   distinguish mere ease from holy peace, and all transient flimsiness
   from the things that abide. And this vigilance and strength were the
   equipment of the Holy Ghost. He kept the soul awake and vigorous, and
   they were not taken by surprise.

   But another apostolic ability is expressed in the kindred phrase, "able
   to quench the darts of the evil one." For sometimes the enemy comes to
   us in sudden flame, and not in seductive light. He leaps upon us in an
   irritation rather than steals upon us in some soothing consolation.
   Some inflammatory suggestion is flung across the threshold of the mind,
   and our life is all ablaze. The fiery dart finds congenial material and
   life is consumed with unholy passion. A spark from a passing engine can
   kindle a fire which can destroy a countryside; and the spark of an
   infernal suggestion, or the merest hint of criticism, or some transient
   incident can convert the soul of the unwary into a house of unclean
   fire. Now, these early apostles had a power to quench these darts. It
   is a wonderful equipment to be kept so cool and quiet in disposition
   that when the inflammatory thing is thrown it finds nothing congenial
   and speedily dies out. This is the ministry of the Comforter.


   Breathe through the pulses of desire

   Thy coolness and thy balm.

   And this "cooling" is the blessed service which the Holy One fulfils in
   the souls who entertain Him as their guest.

   But there is still a third kind of power distinguished in apostolic
   life in relation to the evil one. It is "mighty to the pulling down of
   strongholds." Every generation is face to face with established
   devilry. Castellated wrong rears itself on every side. There are great
   vested interests built upon iniquity. Vice lifts itself in very proud
   mien. Wickedness builds itself a lofty palace. Injustice girds itself
   with legality. Mischief is formed by a law. There are strongholds of
   iniquity. Every great reformer has levelled his attack upon a
   stronghold. There were many in the days of the early Church, and a
   great many still remain; and our power of assault, definite in aim and
   invincible in attack, is to be found in the indwelling and fellowship
   of that mighty Advocate who is Himself also the Minister of our peace.

   There is a third great relationship in which the New Testament
   describes the power of those who are in communion with the Holy. Ghost,
   and that is their power in their relationship to the children of men.
   "With great power gave the apostles witness." That is an ability which
   distinguished the early Church, the power to arrest the indifferent by
   the proclamation of spiritual truth, and by the confession of spiritual
   experience. Their words were weighted with the significance which
   crashed through opposition. How empty our words can be! The Turks have
   been deceived into using empty cartridges, and the ministers of the
   kingdom are often victims of a like deception. We indulge in empty
   words, and the men on the strongholds laugh at our impotence. There is
   nothing more tragical than the employment of forceless speech. But when
   there is life in the word, how tremendous is its passage! "The words
   that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." They do not
   drop like dead lead, or like dead feathers; they go forth like living
   ministers endowed with the terrific life of God. The Holy Spirit is the
   indwelling Partner who fills our cartridges, who endows our speech, and
   makes our words the very vehicles of heavenly power and grace.


   Wing my words that they may reach

   The hidden depths of many a heart.

   There is one other power which I should like to name, which is
   mentioned in the apostolic record: "Able to comfort." Is there any gift
   more gracious than this--to have a wallet filled with oil and wine,
   that when we meet the bruised and the fainting we can minister healing
   and inspiration? Is there any more beautiful ministry to which any
   child of man can be called? To be able to speak words that console, to
   have a presence that heartens and cheers, to give a witness that lifts
   the despondent into the light of hope; this may be the privilege of all
   the friends of Christ Jesus. They may have a ministry in time of sorrow
   like that of sunlight falling upon dark clouds. They may go down the
   gloomy ways of men, lighting lamps of encouragement and hope. "Able to
   comfort!" They have the power to apprehend the ailment and the sorrow,
   and they have the equipment to soothe and to bless. "Ye shall receive
   such power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you."

   I feel that all this is only as a little handful of the abilities
   mentioned in the Word of God as distinguishing those who are the
   companions of the Holy Ghost. I return to the word with which I began.
   Spiritual power, as given to us by God, is executive power, lying
   behind all our faculties and dispositions. It is a fundamental dynamic,
   and in it everything finds its strength. Here, therefore, we must place
   the emphasis in our quest of a stronger life. We must seek the
   communion of the Holy Ghost. This is the originating fellowship in
   which vision is born, and ideals are realized, and in which the soul is
   adorned with the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

V

CHRIST'S HABIT OF PRAYER

   I WANT to consider Christ's habit of private prayer. In the first
   place, it is very significant that He prayed at all. Jesus of Nazareth
   had every form of strength which men associate with masculine life. He
   had strength of body. He had strength of mind. He had strength of
   purpose and will. He had marvellous strength of affection. He had
   strength to move amid foul conditions without catching their contagion.
   He had extraordinary strength of patience. He was absolutely fearless
   in the presence of hostility. He was calm and undaunted when assailed
   by official religion. He had every form of strength which men count
   admirable. And this man prayed. He was constantly praying, and He was
   the strongest who ever trod the ways of men. I want to consider two or
   three occasions in His earthly life when we find Him at prayer.

   First of all, then, I find Him in prayer when temptation drew near. I
   am not now thinking of that early experience in His life which is known
   to us as the Temptation. I turn from that desert experience to another
   which came to Him in the thick of His ministry, after the purpose of
   His redemptive ministry had been revealed. I choose the hour which
   preceded the Transfiguration. Nothing is said about the tempter; but
   unless I utterly misread the incident, and misinterpret the secrets of
   common life, the temptation was fierce and acute. The Lord had
   manifested His love. He had declared His gracious purpose. He had
   sealed His testimony with His deeds. Already He was shedding His blood
   in sacrificial service. And with what results? The horizon was
   blackening with omens of rejection. The storm of hostility was brewing.
   The air was thick with suspicion, derision, and contempt. Unfriendly
   eyes glared upon Him from every side. "He came unto His own, and His
   own received Him not." And just then, when the elements were gathering
   for tempests, I read these words: "He went up into a mountain to pray."
   And why did He go? Before Him there stretched the darkening road to
   appalling desolation. Yonder loomed the cross. And this was the
   temptation which, I think, approached His soul: "Is it worth while?"
   Should He go on to night and crucifixion, or there and then finish with
   translation? Reverently I believe these were the alternatives in those
   days of gathering gloom. Should He choose an immediate re-entry into
   "the glory which I had with Thee before the world was," or a re-entry
   into the world of resentment where dwelt the evil spirits of malice and
   rejection? Should He finish there or go on to the bitter end? "He
   prayed," and while He prayed He made His choice. He would go down to
   the scene of rejection, down to the waiting multitude, down to the
   envious eyes, down to the malicious designs, down to the cross.

   "And as He prayed the fashion of His countenance was altered." And no
   wonder! We are always transfigured when we make choice of the Divine
   will. There came a voice to Him saying, "This is My beloved Son." "And
   they came down from the mountain, and much people met Him."

   Have we not known a similar hour, as far as our own limitations would
   permit? Have we never been tempted to ask i f a certain bit of
   blood-demanding work was worth while? Have we not had pointed out to us
   the flippancy of those we tried to help, their indifference, their
   levity, their contempt, and have we not felt the enticement to lay the
   task down? There is that bit of work we have tried to do on the City
   Council. We have laboured for years. We have been exposed to the
   insults of contested elections. And there is our quiet home, with the
   wife and children, and the slippers and the books. Shall we choose the
   abode of comfort, or return again to difficult service? Shall we put on
   our slippers or stride out again on the heavy, thorny road? Just at
   seasons like these and at that juncture Jesus prayed, and while He was
   on His knees He made His choice.

   Let us look at the Master again in the habit of prayer. "And He healed
   many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils . . .
   and He departed into a solitary place and there prayed." But what need
   was there to pray just then? He was most evidently engaged in doing
   good. The newly-opened eyes of the blind were radiant with
   thanksgiving. The once lame man leaped as a hart. The Master abounded
   in good works, and some measure of popular favour rested upon Him. Then
   why go apart to pray?

   First of all, He retired to pray in order to provide against nervous
   exhaustion. All this healing, all this giving, all this sympathy meant
   large expenditure of vital power. "Virtue is gone out of Me." And,
   therefore, He prayed in order that His vital resources might be
   restored. There is some work that cannot be done without resort to
   Divine communion. When the soul is drained in the ministry of sympathy,
   there is nothing for it but resort to the springs, and there is nothing
   which so readily and powerfully restores a man like drinking the water
   of life. "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength."

   But there is a second reason why our Saviour prayed when He was in the
   midst of successful public work. He prayed in order to make His soul
   secure against the perils of success, against "the destruction that
   wasteth at noonday." Success may bruise the spirit more than failure.
   Heat can ruin a violin quite as effectually as the chilly damp.
   Prosperity slays many a man whose health was preserved in adversity.
   Robert Burns was never the same after the glamour of Edinburgh. And so
   I think our Lord prayed in the hour of popular favour lest His very
   success should maim His life of service. And there is significant
   counsel in His practice for all the children of men. When we are busily
   successful, let us pray, and we need not "be afraid for the arrow that
   flieth by day."

   There is one other occasion in our Master's life of prayer to which I
   want to lead the thoughts of my readers. "Now it came to pass in those
   days that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night
   in prayer to God. And when it was day He called unto Him His disciples,
   and of them He chose twelve." There was a night of prayer, and then
   there was a great decision. Our Lord took time to pray before He made a
   momentous choice. We in our own degree have similar choices to make,
   both in our individual and corporate life. We have to choose our
   careers. We have to make choice of turnings in the ever-winding way. We
   have to choose our representatives in the City Council and in
   Parliament. We have to choose ministers and deacons, and in a hundred
   other ways serious decisions have to be made. Why should we pray? We
   must, first of all, pray in order that big considerations might possess
   the mind. We are prone to live amid small motives, tiny purposes,
   belittling prejudices, partial and lop-sided ambitions. And there is
   nothing kills little things like our prayers. If we take our politics
   into the realm of prayer, it is impossible for us to remain wretched
   partisans. We may give a party vote, but our vision will reach beyond
   the bounds of party, and through a party triumph we shall seek the
   extension of the kingdom of God. When we pray we move into the realm of
   big things, big motives, big sympathies, big ideals. The biggest
   outlooks come to us when we are on our knees. And so, when we are
   making big decisions, let us find time to pray, in order that the
   matters may be greatly decided, and that all little and belittling
   intrusions may be effectually destroyed.

   And so, if we are truly wise, we shall surely pray. To cease to pray is
   to build up the windows of the soul, to close the ventilators, to shut
   out air and light, to immure the soul in an atmosphere devoid of
   inspiration. And yet it is possible so to pray that the spirit of
   prayer shall determine all our purposes, and all our purposes shall be
   fit to steal into our prayers. A friend said of Dr. Westcott that "he
   read and worked in the very mind in which he prayed, and his prayer was
   of singular intensity." That is a great and gracious attainment, and I
   think we can all share the wonderful triumph which mingles prayerful
   aspiration with common toil.

VI

THE THANKFULNESS OF JESUS

   I WANT to lead the meditation of my readers to one of the private
   habits of our Lord--His habit of thanksgiving. Everyone who knows the
   New Testament knows how the apostolic life abounded in praise. It runs
   like some singing river through all their .changing days. And where did
   they learn the habit? They had got it from their Lord. The Master's
   habit must have made a profound impression upon them. There must have
   been something very distinct and distinctive about it. We are told that
   the two disciples, journeying to Emmaus after the awful happenings in
   Jerusalem, recognized their risen Lord when He began to give thanks.
   "He was made known to them in the breaking of bread." They knew Him by
   His gratitude and by the manner in which He expressed it. He was
   recognized by His praise. Let us recall two or three examples of this
   shining habit of our Lord.

   "And Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks." That is to say, He took
   commonplace, common bread, and associated it with God, and it was no
   longer a commonplace. He gave thanks, and in the recognition the common
   was revealed as the Divine. The ordinary meal became a sacrament with
   the Unseen Presence as real as we apprehend Him at the table of the
   Lord.

   Now, a man who feels the divine relationships of bread will have a very
   transfigured road. The man whose praise is elicited by loaves will also
   be thankful for the cornfield, the sunshine, the dew, and the rain, for
   the reapers who gather the corn, for the touch of God in the labourer,
   and for the millstones which grind the corn that makes the bread. He
   who took the loaves and gave thanks would also give thanks for the
   common lily of the field, the daisy of His native land. Indeed, I think
   we may truly say that the Master's habit of praise made every common
   thing radiant, and every wayside bush became aflame with God. He
   breathed His music of gratitude through the commonest reeds.

   Now unless His disciples can do the same, unless we can touch and feel
   God in the commonplaces, He is going to be a very infrequent and
   unfamiliar Guest. For life is made up of very ordinary experiences. Now
   and again a novelty leaps into the way, but the customary tenor is
   rarely broken. It is the ordinary stars that shine upon us night after
   night; it is only occasionally that a comet comes our way. Look at some
   of the daily commonplaces--health, sleep, bread and butter, work,
   friendship, a few flowers by the wayside, the laughter of children, the
   ministry of song, the bright day, the cool night--if I do not perceive
   God in these things I have a very unhallowed and insignificant road. On
   the other hand, the man who discovers the Divine in a loaf of bread,
   and lifts his song of praise, has a wonderful world, for divinity will
   call to him on every side.

   I do not know how we can better begin to cultivate the Master's habit
   than by beginning with daily bread. Because if we begin with bread we
   cannot possibly end there. If we see one commonplace lit up with God,
   other commonplaces will begin to be illumined, until life will be like
   some city seen from a height by night, with all the common lamps in the
   common streets burning and shining with mystic flame. So let us begin
   with bread. But let us give thanks reverently, not with the sudden tap
   and the sharp, superficial sentence of a public dinner. Let us do it
   quietly, apprehendingly, with an effort to realize the presence of the
   awful, gracious, merciful God. And let us do it without formality, and
   seeking deliverance from the perilous opiate of words. Let us change
   our phraseology, let us sometimes bow in silence, and share the
   significant, worshipful stillness of the Friends.

   Let us watch our Master again and listen to His praise. "I thank Thee,
   Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from
   the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." Our Master
   thanks the Father that spiritual secrets are not the perquisites of
   culture, that it is not by cleverness that we gain access into the
   Kingdom of Grace. He gives thanks that "these things" have not been
   made dependent upon academic knowledge, that they are not the prizes of
   the merely clever and acute, but that they are "revealed unto babes."

   Now, mark this: Out of six men only one may be clever, only one may
   have the advantage of knowledge, but all six may have the elementary
   simplicities of a child. All cannot be "knowing," but all can be
   docile. All cannot be "cute," but all can be humble. All cannot be
   "learned," but all can be trustful. All cannot attain to mental
   sovereignty, but all may sit on thrones of sovereign love. And it is
   upon what all may have that our Lord fixes His eye; it is the common
   denominator for which He offers His praise. He takes bread, the
   commonplace of life, and gives thanks; He takes the child, the
   commonalty among men, and gives thanks. He offers praise for the
   commonplaces and the commonalties. He gives thanks for the things that
   are common to Erasmus and Billy Bray, to Spurgeon and John Jaspar, to
   Onesimus and St. Paul. To give thanks for commonplaces makes a
   transfigured world; to give thanks for commonalties makes a
   transfigured race. The one unveils the world as our Father's house; the
   other unveils the race as our Father's family.

   Now, would it not be good to exercise ourselves in that form of praise?
   Would it not be wise to allow our minds to rove over the race of men
   irrespective of class and condition, and search out the commonalties
   and sing our song of praise? One thing such praise would do for us. It
   would preserve in our minds a vivid sense of the relative values of
   things. We should recognize that academic learning is not to be
   mentioned in comparison with loneliness, that carnal power has not the
   holy standing of meekness, and that mere eminence is not to be counted
   in the same world with love. What we may have in common with the
   poorest and most ignorant is our most precious possession.

   Look at the Master once more. "Then they took away the stone from the
   place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said,
   Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me." The Master gave thanks
   before the miracle was wrought, while the dead was still lying stiff
   and stark in the tomb. He offered praise not for the victory attained
   but for victory about to be won. His song was not for what He had
   received, but for what He was about to receive. He gave thanks before
   the dead marched forth, and before the mourners' tears were dried. The
   doxology was sung at the beginning and not at the end.

   "Father, I thank Thee . . ." "And when He had thus spoken He cried with
   a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth, and he that was dead came forth."
   The sound of praise thrilled through the call that awaked the dead.

   Have we learned the habit? Is that the gracious order of our thought
   and labour? Sometimes we thank God for food we are about to receive. Do
   we thank God for power we are about to receive? Do we thank God for
   victory we are about to receive? Do I go forth in the morning to the
   warfare of the day with thanks for coming victory filling me with
   exhilaration and powerful hope? Did I rear my altar of praise before I
   took my sword? Is that how I go to the pulpit, thanking God for
   victories about to be won? Is that how I go to my class, quietly
   confident in the coming of my Lord? Is that how I take up the work of
   social reform? Is the song of victory in the air before I enter the
   field? Can I begin to sing the song of harvest home as I go forth to
   sow the seed? Am I sure of God, so sure that I can sing as soon as the
   struggle begins? That was the Master's way. It was first the thanks and
   then the miracle.

   And so Jesus assumed that His prayer was answered before He addressed
   the dead. And the significance of the act is this. To gratefully assume
   that prayers for power are answered opens the entire being to the full
   and gracious influence of the answer. Gratitude opens the channels of
   the whole life to the incoming of the Divine. There is no mood so
   receptive as praise; it fills the soul with the fulness of God, and the
   indwelling God works wonders, even to the raising of the dead.

   I have given these three examples of the Master's habit of
   thanksgiving. It is our great wisdom to follow in His train. All manner
   of things are promised to the grateful heart. Thanksgiving is to be a
   minister of vigilant sight; "watch in the same with thanksgiving."
   Thanksgiving is to be a stimulant to a jaded and weary soul: "Be not
   drunken with wine, . . . but be ye thankful." Thanksgiving is to be a
   beautifier of the regenerate soul. Ten lepers were purified, only one
   was beautified; "he returned to give thanks." And, lastly, thanksgiving
   glorifies God. It is by the brightness of our praise that we offer the
   best witness to the goodness and power of our God.

THE MAGIC TOUCH

   WHO does not remember the fascinating fairy who filled our childhood
   with wonders, and whose magic wand used to change worn-out shoes into
   silver slippers, and tattered, ragged garments into princely attire,
   and dust-heaps into gardens full of bright and perfumed flowers? How we
   followed the gracious fairy in her transforming ways!

   But fairyland is gone, and fairy wonder is dead. Our years have passed,
   and life has become sombre with care, dashed with sorrow, grey with
   disappointment, and withered and blighted by sin and shame. If only
   something analogous to the romance of childhood could steal back into
   the sombre years of manhood! If only out of the unseen spaces some
   mystic spirit would appear who could transform dulled and blighted
   character, and transform dulled and blighted circumstances, how busy he
   would be! Well, here is an announcement of His coming, and this is what
   He claims to do! "To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
   for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness."
   It sounds like the evangel of some gracious magician. It will be well
   worth while to consider His ways.

   "Beauty for ashes," and the beauty here suggested is the coronet or
   diadem of a bride. Some humiliated, sinful soul, soiled with
   self-abuse, worn and torn, wearied and ashamed, is flinging the ashes
   of her penitence toward heaven, and letting them fall upon her head.
   Those ashes are the emblems of a burnt-out and wasted day, and she is
   flinging them towards the heavens in open confession of her shame, if,
   perchance, the dead embers might be made to glow again. And what does
   the gentle Lord offer this depressed and tainted soul? He offers her
   the coronet of a bride. He will make the dejected exile the wife of the
   Lamb. The poor, wearied drudge of sin is to be honoured by becoming the
   consort of the Holy God.

   What, then, is there in the figure? There is the wonderful love and
   devotion of the eternal, loving God. God loves the most wretched,
   dejected, sin-blasted soul on earth, and lie would encircle that soul
   with the diadem of the bride! If that be true, the love of God is the
   biggest thing we can think about, and the most wonderful theme in human
   speech. If we only realize that love on the authority of His Word, life
   will be illumined and glorified with a far more wonderful light than
   that which fills the soul of a young girl when first she hears the
   whispered word that tells the story of a pure and manly love.

   "Oil of joy for mourning," and this is coronation oil, consecration
   oil, the oil significant of the endowment of regal authority and power.
   Who are to receive coronation? Those whose souls are filled with
   mourning. The mourning is the cry of defeat. It is the wail of the
   failure. It is the moan of the broken. It is the pathetic cry of the
   disordered, the men and women who have fallen, who have succumbed in
   moral and spiritual calamity. That is to say, the good Lord offers the
   crown of restored sovereignty to the children of moral disorder. He
   offers restored regality to those who have "gone to pieces." He offers
   coronation to those who have lost their crowns, sovereignty for those
   who are bruised and broken. "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
   and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, that He may set him with
   princes." He will transform the slave into a monarch. "He crowneth thee
   with loving-kindness and tender mercies."

   "The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness," and the heaviness
   is that of dimness and failing light, light trembling on the verge of
   eclipse. There are people whose lives are like that. There is no heat
   about them, and no radiance. They are cold, dull, cheerless, funereal,
   shut in by encompassing gloom. And the Magician comes, and He offers to
   change that gloomy, sombre attire for the garment of praise. For
   heaviness He will give buoyancy, the joy of the bridal feast for
   heavy-footed woe.

   Surely this. bright, regal, bridal attire is what is lacking in the
   religious life of to-day. There is something wrong with our nobility
   when it is not crowned with radiance. There is something wrong with our
   goodwill when it does not bear the hall-mark of good cheer. There is
   something wrong with our communion when we are not "children of light."
   When the bridal attire is missing there is little or nothing about us
   to suggest that we are the brides of the Lamb. How are men and women to
   know that we are of the King's household if we do not wear "the
   garments of salvation"? How can they believe that we have gazed upon
   the Divine glory if we do not wear the splendours of "the garment of
   praise"?

   I remember two significant sentences in one of Robert Louis Stevenson's
   letters, which express the common judgment of the world: "I do not call
   that by the name of religion which fills a man with bile. If a man is
   surly, filled with a dull and bitter disposition, if he be sombre and
   melancholy, how can he witness to the glories of the eternal life?" And
   the other sentence is this: "I will think more of his prayers when I
   see in him a spirit of praise." Stevenson wanted to see common
   gratitude before he received the witness of a clamant piety. If our
   religion does not clothe us in the refinements of common courtesies it
   will fail to win the interested attention of the men of the world. A
   fine spiritual grace, nobly worn, is a great witness for the Lord. The
   distinction between the Church and the world ought to be found in the
   difference of their habits. The elect ought to prove their relationship
   by the beauty of their moral and spiritual attire.

   Do we believe that the transformation is possible? Have we full
   confidence in the power of the Great Magician? Do we believe that He
   will exchange a coronet for ashes, joyous sovereignty for sullen
   despair, and a garment of radiant cheerfulness for the spirit of gloom?
   If we do not believe it, where is our gospel? If we do not believe it,
   where is our life? The Almighty God can transform the most ungracious
   and unwelcome life. When He touches barrenness, "the wilderness and the
   solitary place become glad, and the desert rejoices and blossoms like
   the rose." And so we can in this great faith confront all the
   deformities of our time. Only in the Lord Jesus can these deformities
   be made straight. When legislation has done its utmost, when education
   has had its last word, the waste place will still remain, and only by
   the immediate personal Presence of the Great Magician can it be made
   beautiful as the paradise of God.

VIII

THE BEQUEST OF PEACE

   "MY peace I give unto you." These words gain immensely deepened
   significance from the circumstances in which they were spoken. When we
   put them into their surroundings they shine like a radiant gem with a
   foil of dark background. When the Lord spake these words He was not
   resting in the domestic love and quietness of the home at Bethany. The
   air was thick with rumours, and the betrayer had gone out, and was even
   now engaged in his treacherous mission. Even Peter's loyalty threatened
   to surrender to evil popular will. Crucifixion was not twenty-four
   hours away. Christ's enemies were at the very gate. It was in
   circumstances like these, turbulent and stormy, that our Lord quietly
   claimed to be in possession of deep and mysterious peace.

   "Peace I leave with you." The form of the speech is that of a customary
   salutation or farewell. "Whatsoever house ye enter let your peace be
   upon it." But our Lord's speech is widely different from the common
   convention. People had fallen into the habit of saying "Peace" as we
   have got into the habit of saying "Good-morning" or "Goodbye," and
   there was as little vital content in one as in the other. The
   salutation had lost its sanctity. It had become a formality of life.
   The customary speech was used just to break an awkward silence; the
   Lord's was used to renew and enrich the heart. The conventional speech
   was idly ceremonial; the Lord's was a gracious achievement. At the
   best, the popular speech was an expression of affability; the Lord's
   benediction was an invaluable bequest. When He said "Peace," there was
   something accomplished, something done. It was not an affair of empty
   words; it was a glorious transaction. "The words that I speak unto you,
   they are spirit, they are life." The salutation was, therefore, vital
   and effective; it was a holy minister, conveying inconceivable
   treasures to the hearts of men.

   "My peace I give unto you." What is the nature of this peace? First of
   all it is rightness with God. When the Lord Jesus Christ brings His own
   peace into the hearts of men, they become inherently sound by becoming
   fundamentally at one with God. It is very significant that the radical
   meaning of the original word is suggestive of union; two sundered
   things are brought together again. And the gift of peace means a
   recovery of healthy fellowship between the soul .and the eternal God.
   Now let it be understood at once that the gift of peace does not imply
   perfection. There may be a general "rightness" in the relationship
   between man and wife, and yet there may be an occasional
   misunderstanding, even a temporary outburst of temper, while nothing
   fundamental becomes crooked or perverse. A general "rightness" or
   healthiness of the body is consistent with an occasional chill or
   superficial scratch or pain. There may be a temporary derangement while
   the heart is as sound as a bell. Our Lord acknowledged this possibility
   in His own gracious teachings. Men may be essentially right with God
   who are not yet by any means perfect. Even a man who has been bathed
   "needeth to wash his feet." And so peace consists essentially in this
   innermost "rightness" with God. The general life tends toward the
   highest. Its primary ambitions are fixed upon the good pleasure of God.
   There is intimacy of fellowship. There is an open road. There is a
   ladder of communion, on which the angels ascend and descend
   continually. The peace that the Lord gives enables the soul to say with
   glad humility, "I and my Father are one."

   And secondly, if peace is fundamental rightness with God, it is also
   fundamental union with God's universe. Natural forces become the
   friendly allies of men who are right with God. "The whole creation
   groaneth and waiteth for the manifestation of the children of God."
   When a man is one with the Maker he has the co-operation of all the
   Maker has made. The winds and currents are his friends. "The stars in
   their courses" fight on his side. There is established "a covenant
   between him and the stones of the field." And so peace is the condition
   of the soul in its God-purposed relationship of being right with Him
   and one with the movements of the Divine order in the world.

   Now, our Lord had this peace. It was His through all His changing days.
   It was independent of seasons, and He had it "in the dark and cloudy
   day." And, therefore, there are certain things we can say about it.
   This peace can exist in the midst of apparent defeat. It does not
   require success to assure one of its presence. We can have God's peace
   and yet be apparent failures in the world. For look at our Saviour
   Himself. Look at His position when the words were uttered. The
   antagonism of the multitude was approaching culmination. Despite His
   wealth of gracious deeds He was everywhere met with deep and fierce
   resentment. Even His own disciples pathetically misunderstood His
   mission. After a training of three years, when He had daily led them
   into the realm of the Spirit and into communion with the Highest, they
   had just been quarrelling one with another, "Who should be greatest."
   One of the disciples was the victim of greed, and he deliberately sold
   his Lord for thirty pieces of silver. The rest of the disciples were
   becoming fearful, and the mood of desertion was upon them. Crucifixion
   was at hand. What an apparent failure! From the worldly point of view
   everything had gone wrong. And yet, in spite of everything, the Lord
   retained His condition of peace. And so it may be with the Lord's
   disciples. The applause of men may not gratify our ears. No worldly
   garland may be put upon our brow. We may climb unto no high place in
   the world's esteem. We may stumble along a painful way, we may be
   continually jostled and elbowed into the rear of the competing crowd,
   and yet we may have fundamental "rightness" with God and share with
   Jesus the condition of heavenly peace.

   If Jesus Christ had this peace, then its possession does not make us
   incapable of sorrow. No; it would be more true to say that this peace
   makes us more capable of sorrow, for to be right with God is to be
   sensitive to His joys and sorrows, and to share them. The Master who
   spake about "My peace" wept over Jerusalem, and His heart was torn by
   the contemplation of the sins of the city. He wept by the grave of
   Lazarus as He called to mind the accumulated common sorrows of the
   world. He wept over the vagrant, aimless multitude, for what is
   "compassion" but a most refined and delicate form of grief? He saw that
   the crowd was wayward and vagrant, purposeless, moving here and there
   in constant danger, and He pitied the crowd with a pity that redeemed
   it. Thus the Lord had an infinite capacity for sorrow, and yet He was
   in possession of peace. It is even so with His disciples. The Apostle
   Paul used words which are seemingly inconsistent with one another,
   "What sorrow I have!" "What travail!" "How I agonize!" And yet he could
   also speak of "The peace of God which passeth understanding." He was
   fundamentally right with God, but the fountain of tears was not dried
   up.


   Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?

   On Jesus' bosom naught but peace is found.

   And then, in the third place, it is evident that the possession of
   peace does not banish the possibility of temptation. Our Master, who
   claimed the possession of peace, was tempted on every side. He had the
   temptations that besiege the flesh and seek the unlawful gratification
   of appetite. He had the temptations which assail the mind and seek to
   entice it to mental presumption. He had the temptations which waylay
   the soul and seek to seduce it into illicit homage. And these
   temptations were repeated throughout His life. He was essentially at
   one with the Father, and yet temptations were never away from His door.
   It is well for us to remember this. We are sometimes inclined to
   suspect the reality of our union with God by the number and prevalence
   of our snares. We are apt to regard our temptations as signs of our
   detachment from the Master. We may be at peace when temptations crowd
   the field. "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
   enemies." God's saints have in all generations sat at that table, and
   their souls have been filled with holy laughter in the confidence of
   their God.

   Now this wonderful peace is the gift of the Lord Jesus. "I give unto
   you." All that is requisite for us to possess the gift is in the power
   of the Lord Jesus. In Him we have the forgiveness of sin. In Him we
   obtain the mystic union with our God. In Him we find the secret
   strength of holy continuance. All are "His and His alone." This peace
   is not the perquisite of some particular temperament. It is not the
   attainment of painful effort and service. It is not the refined fruit
   of prolonged culture. It is a legacy. "Peace I leave with you." It is a
   gift; "My peace I give unto you." "He is our peace."

   And there are two ways in which this gift of peace differs from the
   gifts of the world. In the first place, it differs in the matter of the
   gift. When the world seeks to give peace it addresses itself to
   conditions; the Lord addresses Himself to character. The world deals
   with things; the Lord deals with kinships. The world keeps in the
   material realm; Jesus Christ moves in the spiritual realm. The world
   offers to put us into a fine house; the Lord offers to make a fine
   tenant. The world will introduce us into "fine society"; Jesus will
   make us at home with God.

   In the second place, our Lord differs from the world in the manner of
   His giving. The world always gives its best at the beginning. It offers
   gaudy garlands, brimming cups, and glittering crowns. "But knowest thou
   not it shall be bitterness in the latter end?" It makes an imposing
   fire, but we are speedily left with the ashes. It leads us to a showy
   feast, but we soon encounter aches and pains. It blinds us with the
   "garish day"; then come chill twilight and uncompanionable night. "Not
   as the world giveth give I." He keeps His good wine until last. He
   leads us from grace to grace, from faith to faith, from glory to glory.
   "Greater things than these shall we see." His gifts grow deeper,
   richer, fuller, right through the eternal years.

IX

SEEKING THE BEST

   "THE Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly
   pearls." This sentence gives us one great characteristic of the kingly
   life, for the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Heaven are the kingly men
   and women. They move in great stateliness through the Word of God. They
   are distinguished by humility and dignity, by a certain retirement
   which is allied with the most mysterious glory. Great images are used
   to suggest the greatness of their character. They move in impressive
   lordship and liberty. They are kings and priests unto God. And here I
   say is one of their distinctions; they are seeking goodly pearls.

   And so the kingly life is a life in quest of big things. Everyone is
   painfully familiar with the temptation to fritter away life in
   interests that are small and mean. There are many Scriptural types of
   the wasteful and belittled life. There are those who spend their
   strength in seeking money. The concentrated purpose of their days is a
   quest for gold. They are zealous for artificial gems and they miss the
   goodly pearls. Judas Iscariot had the priceless privilege of communion
   with his Lord. He had the incomparable glory of living with the Master
   day by day--the opportunity of entering into the "inheritance of the
   saints in light," and he used his privilege in the quest for money, and
   all that he got out of his supreme advantage was thirty pieces of
   silver. He missed the pearls.

   And here is another Scriptural type described as "lovers of pleasure
   more than lovers of God." They sought the transitory rather than the
   eternal. They were more intent upon the carnal than the Divine. They
   were out seeking rockets and ignoring dawns. All that they got from
   life was a transient flash. They missed the goodly pearl.

   Here is another from the Scriptural gallery of disastrous failures.
   "Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present evil world." Think of
   that man's opportunity! He had the privilege of the fellowship of the
   Apostle Paul, but he "loved the garish day," and he preferred glamour
   to serenity and a loud sensation to an ideal friendship. The world
   offered a Bohemian hour, and he took it, and the end thereof was found
   in. the white, cold ashes of moral defeat. Thus life is frittered away
   on a thousand trifles, and at the end of the restless quest we have no
   pearls.

   Now the big things of life belong to the realm of spirit and character.
   It is in the region of the soul that we find the pearls. The really
   goodly things, the big things, are inside and not outside the man. The
   big thing is not luxury, but contentment; not a big house, but a big
   satisfaction; not accumulated art treasures, but a fine, artistic
   appreciation; not a big library, but a serene studiousness; not a big
   estate, but a large vision. The big things are not "the things that are
   seen, but the things that are not seen." "Seek peace and ensue it."
   "Seek the things that are above." "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and
   His righteousness." Such are the goodly pearls.

   But the quest of the kingly man is not only for the big things--it is
   for the bigger things among the big, and for the biggest among them
   all. The merchantman was not only in search of goodly pearls; he
   discriminated among the values of pearls, and he knew when he had found
   "one pearl of great price." There are gradations of value even among
   good things. There are pearls and better pearls, and the true king in
   life is known by his pursuit of the best. Knowledge is a good thing,
   the mastery of the secrets of the visible world; wisdom is a better
   thing, the possession of fine judgment and delicate intuition, of moral
   and spiritual discernment. Acquaintance is a good thing; friendship is
   a better thing; love is the best thing. The respect of others is a good
   thing; self-respect is a better thing; a fine, untroubled conscience is
   the best thing. Love for our lovers is a good thing; love for our
   neighbours is a better thing; love for our enemies is the best thing.
   There are pearls and there are pearls of great price. And so this, I
   say, is a mark of the children of the kingdom. They are always in quest
   of something beyond. "Not as though I had already attained, either were
   already perfect, but I press on." There is ever a height beyond, a
   better pearl still to win. "Glories upon glories hath our God prepared,
   by the souls that love Him one day to be shared." Such is the aim of
   the kingly quest. It is in search of the goodliest among the goodly
   pearls.

   Now let us look at the quality of the quest. A kingly man is "like unto
   a merchantman." So the pearls are not found by the loafer, by the mere
   strolling fiddler along life's way. We are to have the characteristics
   of business men, even when we are engaged in the affairs of the
   Highest. If only we assume that requirement as an essential condition
   of the Kingdom of Heaven, a thousand religious failures will be at once
   explained. The majority of us are about as little like merchantmen in
   our religious life as could be very well conceived. And yet this is the
   Master's demand. We are to be business-like in our search for pearls.
   And if we are to be business-like what will be some of our
   characteristics?

   First of all, we shall have breadth of outlook. A good merchant has an
   eye for new markets, for fresh opportunities in new fields. He watches
   drifts and tendencies, movements of population, and he is the alert
   friend of every new discovery. His eyes roam over wide areas in quest
   of new openings to push his trade. And so it is in the Kingdom of
   Heaven. The man of the kingly life must seek his pearls in many markets
   and over wide fields. He must seek them in worship and in prayer and in
   praise. He must look for them in the crowded places of human
   fellowship. He must search the wide expanse of literature. He must busy
   himself with the treasures of history. He must be curious in the bright
   domain of wit and humour. He must be wakeful even on the battlefield,
   when he is in combat with hostile forces, as well as in the quieter
   places of human service and communion. He must assume that anywhere and
   everywhere he may find a goodly pearl. So he must have an eye for
   markets at every hour of the day and amid all the change and varieties
   of human experience. This he must do if he would be a "merchantman
   seeking goodly pearls."

   And, secondly, he must have the ability to fix attention on details.
   The vision of a merchantman is not only telescopic, it is microscopic.
   "He lets nothing escape him." He knows the weight and force of apparent
   nothings; he knows the value of seeming trifles. He often finds his
   treasure in things that other men despise or throw away. He is very
   inquisitive when he finds apparent waste, if by chance he may turn it
   into gold. So must it be in the quest for the goodly pearls of the
   Kingdom. We must give keen attention to the neglected trifles of life.
   Lowly duties must be carefully scanned. Small disappointments must be
   examined as though they were dark caskets containing possible treasure.
   Even commonplace courtesies must not be scouted, but must be regarded
   as a possible hiding place of priceless gems. The Master Himself
   described the man of fine quest as being "faithful in that which is
   least." He does little things in a great way, and he makes great
   discoveries in doing them.

   Thirdly, the kingly life must be distinguished by method and order. A
   fine business man must have method in his work. He has not only
   principles, he has rules; he has not only a general system, he has a
   detailed order. Men who have no method are soon compelled to close
   their doors. And so it is in the life of the Kingdom of Heaven. We do
   not stroll carelessly up to the pearls and find them in some haphazard
   and vagrant loitering. No man lounges into any treasure that is worth
   having. And that is why so many of us are very poor in the things of
   the Kingdom. We have no order and method, and the work of one hour is
   undone by the hour that succeeds it. Look at our prayers. How
   unmethodical and disorderly? Are they likely to find any pearls? Look
   at our worship. How little intelligent quest is in it! Is it likely to
   discover any pearls? Look at our service. How careless it often is and
   how pointless and unprepared! There are abundant signs that even our
   Lord Himself regulated His life and refused to allow it to frivol away
   in indefinite purpose and desire.

   Lastly, the man in search of goodly pearls must be distinguished by
   decision. A competent merchantman knows when to act, and at the
   decisive moment he acts with commanding promptness. He watches
   circumstances when they are ripening, and at the proper moment he
   plucks the fruit. There are times in a business man's life when
   promptness requires great courage. There is a demand for risk and
   speculation and untried enterprise, and timidity would let the
   promising circumstance go by and lose its bounty. So is it in the
   Kingdom of Heaven. Here, too, there are "tides in the affairs of men
   which, taken at the flood, lead on to fortune." It is a great thing to
   know when the hour is ripe for decision. It is one of the fine arts of
   living to know when to act upon an impulse, and when to accept the
   hints of emotion as the signs of a favouring gale. Here again our Lord
   is our example. He was very patient, but He was always very decisive.
   No one could move Him before the appointed time. No one could stop Him
   when He said, "The hour has come." Such is to be the quality of our
   quest. We are to be like merchantmen, broad in outlook, vigilant for
   detail, intelligent in method, and decisive in action.

   With such a spirit we shall undoubtedly discover the goodly pearls, and
   we shall discover the best of all, "the pearl of great price." But for
   that pearl we may have to sell many others. What are we prepared to
   give for it? What are we ready to surrender? According to our
   consecrated enterprise will be our holy gains. If we refuse to part
   with Mammon we can never possess the Lord. If we contentedly hug the
   good we can never gain the better. If we take our ease in the realm of
   the better we can never enter the best. What are we ready to lose for
   Christ?


   Were the whole realm of nature mine,

   That were an offering far too small.

   Love so amazing, so divine,

   Demands my life, my soul, my all.

WITHERED HANDS

   ALL the miracles of our Lord are purposed to be symbols of analogous
   works which can be wrought in the soul. "But that ye may know that the
   Son of Man hath power" to heal and emancipate the spirit He restored a
   paralyzed body to freedom. He drove the palsy out of the body as a
   token that He could drive the palsy out of the soul. He could impart
   the same strength and buoyancy and agility to the one as He had given
   to the other. And so it is with all the miracles of our Lord; they are
   types of the "greater things than these" which He can work among the
   secret needs of the spirit. Here was a man with a withered hand. A
   legend comes along the centuries that he was a bricklayer, an ordinary
   working man, who had been reduced to impotence by the loss of the
   member he needed most. But his calamity had not embittered him or made
   him spiritually insensitive. He was found in the synagogue seeking
   communion with God. And there the Master met him and restored life to
   his withered limb, and he was whole again.

   Now there are withered faculties of the soul. There are spiritual
   members that can become dry and impotent. There are mysterious hands
   which can lose their grip and even their power to apprehend the
   heights. And a diseased faculty can impair the strength of the entire
   life. It can check our spiritual progress, and impair the vigour of
   moral aspiration and service. And these withered limbs can be found in
   the Church. They are brought into the place of worship, and they are
   often taken out again withered and dead. We do not establish the
   communion with the Healer which insures the ministry of the
   irresistible forces of grace.

   The faculty of love can be a withered hand. It can shrivel away until
   it has no strength, no reach, no hold. I suppose we may test the
   quality of love by the length and strength of its apprehension. How far
   can it stretch? What is the intensity of its grip? How long can it hold
   out? The people who have the strongest love have the fullest assurance
   of moral triumph.. It is sometimes said that money can unlock any door.
   The statement is the merest nonsense. There are treasure-houses, the
   most real and the best, that money can never touch. Love is the great
   "open sesame." A man with a fine love burns his way like fervent iron
   through ice. He pierces through every difficulty, and nothing is
   allowed to obstruct his way. "Love never faileth." But when the love
   itself begins to wither, like a limb that shrivels through lack of
   vitality, life is comparatively impotent. And how frequently we see
   this spiritual tragedy! "I have something against thee, thou hast lost
   thy first love." It is the disease of the withered hand. Something has
   happened at the very fountains of vitality, and love sickens and dies.

   The faculty of hope can be like a withered hand. Think for a moment of
   a man endowed with brilliant hope, pursuing some personal quest or
   engaged in some social crusade. What power there is in his goings! What
   spring there is in the feet of a man who "feels the days before him"!
   The man who lays hold of the triumph of to-morrow has a mighty
   inspiration in the battle of to-day. The man who sees "the holy city,
   New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God" is a glorious
   labourer in the Jerusalem that is, seeking to transform and transfigure
   it into the light and beauty of his vision. The man endowed with hope
   is a magnificent worker. He sees the diamond in the carbon; he sees the
   finished garden in the desert waste. But if hope shrivels into
   despondency, or dies away in despair, how helpless is the man who
   touches the task! It is hope that fetches the bread that feeds
   endeavour; it is hope that sustains the life. We are "saved by hope."
   But let hope shrivel, and a dulness steals over the spirit; laxity and
   limpness take possession of the soul. When a man can say, "I have lost
   my hope," he is a man with a withered hand.

   The conscience can be a withered hand. A live conscience gives a man a
   fine, nervous, sensitive, "feeling" touch of the mind of God. It gives
   a man a discerning apprehension of right and wrong. When the feeling is
   really sensitive, what confidence it imparts to life's movements, what
   firmness, what motion, what decision! But the conscience can be
   benumbed. It can become as unresponsive as a paralyzed hand. Common
   experience affords abundant illustration. There are many people who
   were once endowed with a scrupulous moral sense, and in some way or
   other it has lost its exquisiteness, and they no longer finely realize
   the will of God. The withering is made manifest in apparently small
   disloyalties. We do not sustain the sense of honour in the full round
   of common life. There are ministers who are intensely scrupulous about
   orthodoxy who are not equally scrupulous in more practical obligations.
   They shrink from heresy; they do not shrink from debt. I have known
   people deface other people's property by writing Scriptural texts upon
   it! They have a sensitive desire to serve the Lord, but their honour is
   not keen enough to make them respect the common rights of their
   fellows. And often the unscrupulous may degenerate into the vicious.
   Moral unsoundness is like every other disease, it can proceed from the
   apparent trifle until it corrupts the pillars of the life. Poison can
   begin with a pin-prick and may at length reach the heart. A withering
   conscience is an unspeakable peril. A withering conscience indicates
   that a man is dead.

   The will may be like a withered hand. What a strong, pushful,
   resourceful hand it is when it is endowed with healthy vitality! But
   when it withers, everything is touched with irresolution and hesitancy.
   Nothing is initiated with power. Nothing is addressed with persistence.
   Nothing is accomplished with decision. A feeble will makes all life's
   doings anaemic. Everything is languid, from the sickly promise to the
   imperfect achievement.

   What can we do with all or any of these faculties of the soul? We have
   only one resource. We can bring them to Him who made them, and who can
   remake them by the power of His grace. But we must bring them
   deliberately, naming the withered member in the presence of our Lord.
   We must bring them submissively, laying aside all presumption and
   pride. We must bring them obediently, ready and willing to carry out
   the King's decrees. If He orders us to attempt the impossible, we must
   attempt it. "Stretch forth thy hand!" The man might have replied,
   "Master, that is just what I cannot do!" "Stretch forth thy hand," and
   the attempt being made, the needful power was found, and the man was
   made whole. So must I bring my withered love to Him, and if need be I
   must "stretch it forth" in effort and service. If He bid me I must act
   as though I have a healthy love, and in the very effort I shall find I
   have received it. I must bring my withered hope to Him. At His command
   I must stretch it forth. I must act as a hopeful man, and I shall find
   that the gracious light is restored. The Saviour's power goes with the
   Saviour's demand. The Saviour's power is received in human obedience.

THE THORN REMAINS

   THE Apostle Paul was afflicted with some bodily infirmity, some
   extremely painful disease whose symptoms were marked by frequent
   recurrence. Many suggestions have been made as to the nature of the
   disease. Bishop Lightfoot inclines to the opinion that it was epilepsy.
   Others have fixed upon ophthalmia; Ramsay has recently advanced the
   theory of malarial fever. It does not very much matter for our
   immediate purpose what was the particular form of the infirmity.
   Whatever it was, it appeared to cripple the Apostle; his sacred purpose
   seemed to be hampered and partially defeated. Even the healthiest of
   bodies would have been all too slow and sluggish for his burningly
   passionate soul; but a damaged body was an obtrusive impediment to his
   great crusade. He prayed about it as only Paul could pray; he prayed
   that it might depart from him. He offered the prayer twice, thrice, and
   repeatedly. And then there was given to him that mystic revelation,
   that enlightenment of conscience, that dawning of interpretation, so
   often given to the soul that waits on God; he was given the wider
   vision, the larger understanding, in which similar problems find their
   solution. "My grace is sufficient for thee, for My power is made
   perfect in weakness." And this being interpreted seems to say, "Thy
   apparent weakness may be a channel of strength. The seemingly
   ungracious thing may be a means of grace. The very infirmity of the
   organ may confirm the authority of the message. God may become more
   visible through thy frailty. God may dawn upon the world through thy
   gloom. My grace is sufficient for thee; through thy seeming weakness My
   power shall be perfected." And so these were the results of the
   Apostle's prayers; first, the thorn remained, the bodily pain continued
   as his guest; second, the prayer was answered in an accession of grace
   which converted a crown of thorns into a crown of glory.

   So this seems to be the principle of the interpretation given to the
   Apostle Paul. The apparent weakness may become the very occasion of
   power. The seeming handicap may redound to the glory of the Lord. The
   combatants seem to be one man with a thorn versus the tremendous
   resistance of Asia, and the supercilious cynicism and indifference of
   Athens, Corinth, and Rome. But the realities are these: one man with a
   thorn plus the grace of God, and the very thorn becomes a medium of
   power, and through the obtrusive weakness God's strength is more
   perfectly revealed. When Paul had fully grasped the significance of
   this enlightenment his impatience was changed into quietness, his
   irritableness into confidence, and his complaint into sacred
   jubilation. "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
   weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may spread a tabernacle over
   me." "I take pleasure in weaknesses . . . for when I am weak then am I
   strong."

   So here is the vivid lesson shining across the Apostle's consecrated
   life; he prayed, and yet the thorn remained, but grace was given
   whereby the very infirmity became the servant of his strength and a
   minister to the glory of God.

   Now let us bring that principle into our own life, and let us see its
   applications to our own conditions and needs. We too have our thorns in
   the flesh, things that seem to hinder our work, apparent obstructions
   to the progress of the Kingdom of God. If these could be taken away,
   with what blessed freedom we could run in the way of God's
   commandments! We pray that the hindrance might be taken away from us.
   And yet it remains, and the meaning of the apparently unanswered prayer
   is this, that God wishes to give grace in order that these seemingly
   adverse circumstances may be converted into our slaves, and made to
   minister to our own highest interests, to the welfare of others, and to
   the glory of God.

   Take the matter of physical frailty. Perhaps that is our trouble. Just
   the lack of lusty robustness. Our reserves of strength are very scanty.
   We are hampered by the bodily clog, and the interests of the Kingdom
   suffer. We pray for the restoration of health, but the thorn remains.
   But the prayer is not unanswered. God comes to us in an accession of
   grace which converts the very sword into a ploughshare, into an
   implement of moral and spiritual culture. Frances Ridley Havergal was
   very frail, frail as the most delicate porcelain. She prayed for
   greater strength, but the thorn remained. But who will say that her
   prayer was unanswered? Think of the tender songs that were sung from
   her frail tent! Her very weaknesses endowed her with delicacies of
   intuition, discernments in sacred explorations, sympathies with the
   travail of her Lord, which have made her the precious guide and teacher
   of tens of thousands of the children of God. Her power was made perfect
   in weakness. Or take Mrs. Browning. Physically she was frail as an
   autumn leaf. "Once I wished not to live, but the faculty of life seems
   to have sprung up in me again from under the crushing feet of heavy
   grief." She prayed once, twice, thrice, and the thorn remained. But
   grace was given, and she gave us "Aurora Leigh" and "The Cry of the
   Children." "I cannot lament having learned in suffering what I taught
   in song." Her husband declared that she was "always smilingly happy
   with a face like a girl's." And when I take down Mrs. Browning's poems
   I think of her frail and wan face, and those large, serene eyes, and
   the calm and lofty brow, and I say "His power was made perfect in her
   weakness."

   Or take another apparent infirmity, the affliction we call nervousness.
   Some people are like a bundle of exposed nerves. They are endowed with
   exquisiteness of feeling which makes every jar a discord, a
   catastrophe. They experience vividness and intensity of emotion. They
   are slim and sprightly, and the crack of the whip almost excites a
   mental and moral convulsion. They pray for its removal. They ask for a
   temperament a little more numb to all the pangs of outrageous fortune.
   But the thorn remains. The prayer is answered in a better way. By the
   grace of Christ their very sensitiveness is made the minister of
   strength and fruitful service. God's power is made perfect in weakness.
   Robertson of Brighton was extremely sensitive. He was easily jarred.
   His whole being was as full of feeling as the eye. An ugly colour
   "brought on nervous irritations." "A gloomy day afflicted him like a
   misfortune." He prayed for the removal of the infirmity, and the thorn
   remained. But his prayer was answered. His very weakness was made the
   vehicle of strength. His sensitiveness gave him his sense of awe and
   triumph in the presence of nature. It gave him his almost instinctive
   sense of the characters of men. It gave him his superlatively fine
   apprehension of the secrets of the Most High. His nervous temperament
   remained, but God gave him a sufficiency of grace, and through his
   apparent infirmity God's power was made perfect.

   And so it is with many other infirmities that one might name. It is
   true of temptation. It is true of the disposition that is haunted by
   painful questionings. They may become to us the ministers of God's holy
   grace. If the thorn were removed one of the helpers of our health and
   progress would be gone. The thorn on the rose-bush is the purposed
   friend and not the enemy of the rose. The flower is all the more surely
   perfected because the thorn remains. And so it is with the thorns of
   the soul. By the very retention of the thorn faith is nourished, and
   ordered power, and the faculty to apprehend the glory of God when He is
   pleased to reveal it. And thus are we led to the all-sufficiency of the
   grace of the Father in the Heaven.

THE SONG OF MOSES AND THE LAMB

   IN the mystical and mysterious book of Revelation there is a strange
   and jubilant song sung by "them that have gotten the victory over the
   beast." I am not concerned to identify any particular beast over whom
   these singers had proved victorious. The beast may very well and justly
   stand as typical of all that is unspiritual, the general beastliness
   which man has to encounter as he struggles towards his crown. Tennyson
   gives me the suggestion I seek in his description of the four tiers of
   symbolic sculpture which adorned the walls of Merlin's Hall:


   On the lowest beasts were slaying men;

   On the second men were slaying beasts;

   On the third were warriors, perfect men,

   And on the fourth were men with growing wings.

   The singers in the Seer's vision had attained to this glorious power of
   wing; they had gotten the victory over the beast.

   And what was the burden of their song? First of all they sang the
   eternal righteousness of God. "Righteous and true are Thy ways." That
   is ever the main theme of psalmist, prophet, apostle, martyr, and
   saint; that is the ground-work of the heavenly music, the very stuff
   and substance of the song. The praise of the blest is not primarily
   concerned with the tender love of God or His infinite compassion; not
   first with the flowers of the earth, but with earth's enduring frame;
   not first with God's graces, but with His grace, His incorruptible
   holiness. For what love can there be without a basis of truth? And what
   is the worth of mercy without the solidity of rectitude? And so it is
   that when these singers break into song this is the theme of their
   music: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!"

   And, secondly, their music wanders among the wonders of God's
   progressive providence. "Great and marvellous are Thy works! "These
   works are not primarily the works of nature, but the works of grace.
   The singers are contemplating the truth in its conflict with falsehood.
   They are watching the wonders of holiness in its hallowing ministries
   among the children of men. They are recalling the romance of God's
   providence as they see it unrolled through the generations of their own
   troubled national history. And their doxology of providence and grace
   gathers about two names, the names of Moses and the Lamb. In their
   songful recital of providential deliverances these two names seem to
   crystallize and tell the story. And what is the significance of the
   names? Surely it is this: Moses signifies emancipation from social
   bondage; the Lamb signifies emancipation from spiritual bondage. Moses
   stands for deliverance from wrong. The Lamb stands for deliverance from
   sin. Moses delivers from the wrong which man may suffer from his
   brother. The Lamb delivers from the wrong which man may suffer from
   himself. Moses delivers from the Pharaoh outside man. The Lamb delivers
   from the devil within man. Moses delivers from the gall of oppression
   and pain. The Lamb delivers from the gall of guilt and sin. This is the
   song the singers sing, the "Song of Moses and the Lamb"--Thy marvellous
   works in Moses against all wrong; Thy marvellous works in the Lamb
   against all sin!

   Let me still further emphasize the distinction here made. The song of
   Moses described a deliverance from the Egyptian house of bondage. It
   narrated an Exodus from oppression and servitude. The deliverance was
   the destruction of a galling yoke imposed by man on man. It was the
   overthrow of tyranny. And that deliverance is sung as a great and
   marvellous work of God; God is working through a human leader to human
   emancipation. And this deliverance by Moses is being continued to our
   own day. In every generation there is some new Exodus from servitude,
   led by men inspired by the Holy Spirit of God. The leader himself may
   not be conscious of his divine inspiration, but he is nevertheless the
   instrument of God's right hand. Wherever men have been fettered in
   physical servitude, wherever minds have been imprisoned in the darkness
   of ignorance, wherever hearts have been bruised and broken and a leader
   has appeared to set the captive free, that leader was a Moses, the
   champion of a new Exodus, and his crusade of freedom was inspired of
   the Lord.

   Our own time has been singularly distinguished by such emancipations. I
   know not how many big and petty tyrannies have been fought within the
   compass even of one generation. In mine and factory, among women and
   children, on land and sea, among the labourers in the field, and among
   the sailors on the deep, yokes have been broken, prison doors have been
   opened, oppression has been righted, and captives have been led into
   the fair domain of freedom. To tell the story of freedom during the
   last fifty years would be to sing "a Song of Moses" worthy to be
   chanted with the song of Revelation sung by the victors at the crystal
   sea.

   There are many more bondages yet to be broken; many more tyrants yet to
   be dethroned. Wrongs still stalk abroad unabashed and unashamed. There
   is many a chivalrous exodus yet to be won. And the heavenly allies are
   on the side of those who seek to do the work. The mystic horses and
   chariots are on the hill. The mystic ministers, with their golden
   censers and their golden vials, are still in active service. We are
   fellow-workers with the spirits of good men made perfect, and all
   heaven is enlisted on the side of those who seek "to set at liberty
   them that are oppressed."

   But when the "Song of Moses" has been sung, what then? Lead your
   bondslaves out of Egypt. When you have lifted the tyranny, what about
   those who have been set free? When you have given the seaman the
   protection of the load-line he may still reel about the port. When you
   have lifted the tyranny from the factory operative he may delight to be
   a beast. When you have given the labourer a vote you have not given him
   either a conscience or a will. The fact of the matter is, when we have
   lifted a man out of Egypt we may yet leave him in hell. And let it be
   remembered that a man may remain in the bondage of Egypt, and yet be in
   heaven. There is many a servant living to-day in severe and
   unattractive social servitude who is yet in fellowship with a heaven
   their master or mistress has never known. Slaves sang their songs in
   the early Christian Church while they were still in their servitude,
   and we catch snatches of the music to-day. Yes, all that is true; the
   prison-house has been bright with the splendours of heaven. And this,
   too, I say, is true; that a man may gain a certain liberty and yet may
   enter into a deeper servitude. A man may be redeemed from Egypt and may
   become a more ignoble slave. The shackles may have been struck from his
   limbs but they are still on his soul. One tyrant is gone, but the
   greater tyrant remains. What, then, do we need? Moses can destroy the
   lesser tyranny, but he cannot touch the greater. We need another and a
   mightier exodus; we need another and a mightier Moses. The one can work
   the wonders of the Red Sea and smite and cleave the intercepting flood;
   we need one who can command and subdue the waters of passion and make
   its turbid waters clear and clean as the crystal sea. And so to the
   "Song of Moses" it is imperative that we add the "Song of the Lamb." We
   shall find at Calvary what can never be found at the Red Sea.

   "Babylon is fallen." So do I hear again and again resounding in the
   Book of Revelation. It is the emancipating word of Moses, and we needs
   must sing and shout when the tyrant is vanquished, "The slave trade is
   fallen!" It is the emancipating word of Moses, and we needs must sing
   when the slave is free. But what has happened when we sing the "Song of
   the Lamb"? Another exodus has happened with deeper experiences, leading
   into a far more glorious freedom. "If the Son, therefore, shall make
   you free ye shall be free indeed." And how are His freed ones
   described? They are "clothed in white robes"; they have attained to
   purified habits and dispositions. They have "palms in their hands," the
   symbol of sovereignty, the emblem of a strong and graceful
   self-conquest and self-control. And they are singing; the discords of
   life have been subdued to sweetest harmony. Such is the free one in the
   Lord. Moses can never make him; he is the creation of the Lamb.

   There is a very modern significance in all this. It is imperative that
   we remember that Moses can never do the work of the Lamb. We are living
   in a day when we are very much tempted to believe he can. The "Song of
   Moses" is prone to make us forget the "Song of the Lamb." We are busy,
   and wisely busy, legislating, emancipating, educating, co-operating. It
   is all good, and I will sing the song of thanksgiving, but it will
   never do. The Moses-ministry is pathetically insufficient. It may give
   us a little more ease, it will never give us a wealthy peace. It may
   make us more comfortable; it will never make us inherently good. "We
   are complete in Him," in Him alone, and in Him only, "the Lamb slain
   from the foundation of the world."

XIII

WAVE AND RIVER

   I AM writing these words in sight of a fine, fresh sea. A strong
   south-westerly breeze is blowing, and huge waves are moving swiftly to
   their culmination, and breaking majestically on the shore. A little way
   up the coast a broad river, full and brimming, fed by a hundred
   tributaries from the rain-drenched hills, is leisurely emptying its
   voluminous flood into the advancing sea. And as my eyes pass from the
   sea to the river, and again from the river to the sea, I am reminded of
   two very powerful figures, used by the greatest of the Old Testament
   prophets, and which may have had their birth in conditions similar to
   those which I am gazing upon to-day. "O, that thou hadst hearkened to
   My commandments; then had thy peace been like a river, and thy
   righteousness like the waves of the sea." The figures are strikingly
   original and suggestive, and I think that they enshrine conceptions of
   truth which afford healthy correctives to some soft and effeminate
   thinking of our own time.

   "Then had thy peace been like a river!" That itself is a most unusual
   sphere in which to find a symbol of peace. Most people, when they want
   a symbol of peace, would seek it in some secluded mountain-tarn,
   nestling quiet and unrippled far away from beaten roads, and where even
   the cry of a vagrant bird is only rarely heard. It is by these "still
   waters," and in these deep silences, that we should call to mind the
   gift of peace. Other people are impressed with the "peacefulness" of
   the chamber of death. When they see the body lying perfectly still, and
   when every sound is muffled, everybody speaking in whispers, and going
   about on tiptoe, they feel constrained to say, "How peaceful!"

   How different is the prophet's choice of figure! Not a stagnant tarn,
   not a lifeless body, but a river! The erroneous conception gathers
   about a particular sort of stillness; the true conception gathers about
   a particular quality of movement. Peace is not motionless quietness,
   but quiet motion. Peace has its appropriate figure in the brimming
   river, deeply quiet because of its depth. Peace is liquid motion,
   frictionless movement! That is the phrase which expresses my present
   thought. Perfect peace is found in human life when that life moves in
   God's life without babble, or fret, or friction. It is not so much
   found in the absence of sound as in the absence of discord. It is
   musical movement, it is harmony.

   Our Master's conception of peace is given in His oft-repeated words, "I
   and My Father are one." When one life flows into another life with
   perfect commingling--will with will, thought with thought, desire with
   desire, then we have the basal secret of peace. And when that perfect
   commingling is between the human heart and God, we have learned the
   secret of perfect peace. That was Jesus's peace, and this is Jesus's
   promise, "My peace I give unto you."

   "And thy righteousness like the waves of the sea." Well, let me go
   nearer the sea. I leave the dry upper beach, and go down to the water's
   edge. There in the distance a fine wave is forming, gathering volume
   and impetus as it rolls. Let me step forward, confront it, and check
   its advance! The wave laughs at the antagonism, and races shoreward
   with powerful and jubilant flood. And my righteousness is purposed to
   be like that! "Thy righteousness like the waves of the sea." But in the
   lives of the majority of us, even of those who profess to know the
   Lord, there is nothing characteristic of a glorious wave. Our
   righteousness is more like some trembling rivulet, uncertainly
   threading its way in time of drought. Any small antagonism can check
   it, and delay it, and divert it. We timidly shrink behind the
   impediment; we do not clear it at a leap! The truth is, the wave-force
   is pathetically lacking in many Christian lives. There is nothing
   strong and positive; there is no vigorous trend because there is no
   definite end. Their purposes meander along, and any obstacle can hinder
   them, and any hostile foot can turn them aside.

   If our life is to find a fitting symbol in the waves of the sea, then
   it is to be distinguished by a commanding force of character. It will
   be grandly impressive, and will be known by its "go." Surely, this must
   be something of the meaning of Paul's inspiring words, "we have not
   received again the spirit of fear . . . but of power." Ours is not to
   be a spirit of fear, of trembling, like the uncertain surf, "carried
   with the wind and tossed" about the shore. Ours is to be a spirit of
   power, moving in noble impressiveness, and with the invincible majesty
   of a magnificent wave. Again and again our Lord sets before His
   disciples the strong ideal of a character which "tells," which is
   positive and bracing. He seemed to be afraid of their discipleship
   weakening down into an anaemic sentimentality, a forceless effeminacy
   which would never arrest the world, or take the Kingdom of Heaven by
   storm. He did not wish His disciples to be only as a pleasant perfume;
   He wished them to be more like that strong breeze which is even now
   blowing upon me from the southwest, pervaded with the pungent smack of
   the salt sea! "Ye are the salt of the earth." I think it is the same
   element of impressiveness which is suggested in the figure of the
   advancing wave. And when this forceful, impressive element is wanting,
   when this energetic spirit is absent, then the individual Christian, or
   that fellowship of Christians which we call the Church, becomes as
   "salt that has lost its savour," a poor, savourless presence, and the
   world will pay no heed, or treat it as something to be despised and
   "trodden under foot of men." There were some in the Corinthian Church
   who had become thus enervated and forceless, and the Apostle seeks to
   stir them up into a more vigorous life. "Some are sickly, and not a few
   sleep!" How far was this from the forcefulness of the triumphant wave!
   It was more significant of the stagnant pool, with a noisome corruption
   mantling its idle face. There are many men who, on the business side of
   their life, have all the strong impetuosity of a wave but on the
   distinctively moral and religious side their will beats as feebly as a
   forceless pulse. They flaunt a religious profession, but they have no
   religious "life." These constitute the very bane of the Kingdom, for
   they are the unimpressive professionals who make the Christian religion
   unattractive and repellent. But when our righteousness becomes like a
   wave, its very power will hold the world in rich and fertile wonder.

THE GUIDING HAND

   THERE is a familiar phrase which is twice repeated in the twenty-third
   Psalm: "He leadeth me," but the two usages have very different
   surroundings. In the first the surroundings are pastoral, a deep
   restfulness is in the air, and all things are significant of relaxation
   and repose. "He leadeth me beside waters of rest." It is like walking
   on the banks of a river on some serene Saturday night, when the work of
   the week is over, and the very beasts of the field seem to have begun
   their Sabbath rest. In the second usage the surroundings are altogether
   changed. Rest becomes action; relaxation becomes strenuousness. We
   leave the "waters of rest" for the exposed and storm-swept uplands. We
   turn to the frowning slopes, with their terrors of wild beasts and
   tempests. Life becomes militant. "He leadeth me in the paths of
   righteousness." It is like leaving the sweet and fragrant vineyards of
   the lower Alpine slopes for the bare and craggy heights, and the
   dubious and treacherous ways of the snow. But the guide who leads
   through the vineyard leads also through the snows; and it is the same
   God who leads by the "waters of rest," who also leads into exacting and
   exhausting "ways of righteousness." The Lord of the restful valley is
   also King of the flood and Sovereign of the terrible heights.

   And this brings me to the theme of the present meditation; the Divine
   leadership, the grace of the guiding hand. There is surely nothing
   remote or obscure in the theme. It is relevant and immediate to
   everybody. We differ in many things and in many ways; we differ in age
   and in calling, in physical fitness and in mental equipment; we differ
   in knowledge and accomplishments; we are greatly different in
   temperament, and therefore in the character of our daily strife. But in
   one thing we are all alike--we are pilgrims travelling between life and
   death, on an unknown road, not knowing how or when the road may turn;
   not knowing how or when it may end; and we are in urgent need of a
   Greatheart who is acquainted with every step of the way. We are all in
   need of a leader who will be our guide by the "waters of rest," and
   also in the perilous ways of the heights.

   Now how does the Lord lead us? I want to find the answer in the word
   and life of the Scriptures. And when I turn to the Scriptures I find
   that the means and methods of Divine leadership are many, that the
   Great Leader is like a wise human leader, and He adapts His ministries
   to the nature of the child and the character of the immediate need. I
   can only mention two or three of these varied methods of leadership as
   I find them in the Word of God.

   And here is the first: "And the Lord spoke thus to me with a strong
   hand." It is the speech of a young prophet, and it describes a leading
   of God. Let us apprehend the figure. The counsel of the Lord has come
   to Isaiah like a strong hand, as something he could not escape. The
   intuition laid hold upon him like an arrest. What was the nature of the
   counsel? He was called upon by the Lord to separate himself from his
   nation. by a solemn act of detachment. He was commanded to confront his
   people, to oppose them, to leave the majority and stand alone. He was
   bidden to prophesy the unpleasant and even to predict defeat. We know
   how such men are regarded--they are denounced as unpatriotic, as devoid
   of national feeling and fraternal ambition. The young prophet shrinks
   from the task; he is tempted to silence and retirement; he meditates
   retreat; but the Word of the Lord came to him "with a strong hand." The
   imperative gave him no freedom; heaven laid hold on him with holy
   violence; the invisible gripped his conscience as a man's arm might be
   gripped, until it ached in the grasp.

   Now this is one method of leading--a grip like that of a powerful
   constable. This was the kind of leading that came to Saul as he
   journeyed to Damascus. It was the kind of violent arrest that laid hold
   of John Bunyan as he played on Elstow-green. Sometimes the violent
   leading takes the shape of a startling ministry of disappointment or
   affliction. Sometimes the Lord lays hold of us with the cold, stony
   grip of fear, and we are moved in the way of life by the terror of
   impending calamity. Yes, the holy Lord sometimes arises and "shaketh
   terribly the earth." He grips and He shakes; but the ministry is
   governed by infinite mercy and love. "By terrible things in
   righteousness dost Thou answer us, O God of our salvation."

   And here is a second method of leading: "I will guide thee with Mine
   eye." How startling the change! We pass from the grip of the hand to
   the glance of an eye, from a grip as severe as a vise to a touch as
   gentle as light. We pass from a nipping frost to a soft and cheering
   sunbeam. I find the word in the thirty-second Psalm, and the Psalm
   itself has provided me with the figure of violent contrast. "Be ye not
   as the horse or the mule." The mule is headlong and headstrong, and he
   is to be guided by the "strong hand." But the Lord would guide us by
   His eye. How exceedingly delicate is the guidance of a look! What
   tender intercourse can pass through the eyes! There is a whole language
   in their silent communion. But let it be marked that this eye-guidance
   implies very intimate fellowship. Eye-speech is the speech of lovers.
   We may be guided by a "strong hand," even when we are heedless of God;
   we can only be guided by His eye when we are gazing on God.

   Let me give two examples of lovers who were guided by the eye. And let
   this be the first: "They looked unto Him and were lightened." That is
   guidance by a look. Whilst they worshipped they received the light.
   Their minds were illumined while they gazed. "They caught the ways of
   God," and they had a certain radiance of spirit which assured them that
   they had found the King's will. We cannot say much about the delicate
   experience through the clumsy medium of words. There are some
   communions for which ordinary language is altogether insufficient. Who
   can explain the message that passed between souls in love with one
   another; and who can . describe the gentle communion of souls in love
   with God?

   But here is another instance of this delicate guidance of the eye:
   "Jesus turned and looked upon Peter." That, too, was a look from Lover
   to lover. I know that one of the lovers had failed, but his love was
   not quenched. He had failed at the test, but the love was still
   burning. And Jesus turned, and with a look of poignant anguish He led
   His disloyal disciple into tears, and penitence, and reconciliation,
   and humble communion, and liberty. Peter was guided by the eye of his
   Lord.

   Let me give one further instance of the leadings of God, and this time
   from the experience of the Apostle Paul: "After they were come to Mysia
   they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not."
   And what kind of leading was this? It was leading by impediment. It was
   guidance by prohibition. It was the ministry of the closed door. There
   came to the Apostle what the Friends would describe as a "stop in the
   mind." His thought was resisted and had no liberty. He felt that his
   purpose was secretly opposed by an invincible barrier. In certain
   directions he had no sense of spiritual freedom, and therefore he
   regarded that way as blocked. "The angel of the Lord stood in the way
   for an adversary." I think it is very needful to emphasize this. God
   sometimes leads us by negations. The closed door is the indication of
   His will. We assay to go, but the Spirit suffers us not.

   But whatever form the Divine leading may take, it is not always clear
   and immediate. Our great Leader sometimes keeps us waiting before we
   know His will. It is often very difficult to find out what His will
   really is. Would it be well for it to be otherwise? Would it be best
   for His will to be known immediately, and without the faintest shadow
   of doubt? Is there no kindly purpose in obscurity? Has mystery no place
   in the curriculum of life's school? Is there no gracious ministry in
   delay? If we always and everywhere enjoyed perfect and immediate
   lucidity we should abide in the condition of babes. We gain immense
   wealth from the discipline of uncertainty. Uncertainty impels us to
   exercise our sight. We critically observe the issues. We estimate
   possibilities. We weigh scruples. If the scales of guidance always went
   down with a bang it might make it easy, but it would never make us
   strong. The scales of guidance often turn with a hair, and part of
   life's discipline consists in watching the scales to see how they turn.
   The consequence is that when we know God's will we have also
   strengthened our sight. We have refined our powers of discernment in
   the act of making the discovery. And as we gain from the discipline of
   watching we also gain from the discipline of waiting. We gain
   self-control and patience and the noble refinements of hope. And thus
   we see that obscurity and delay do not imply the Divine absence or
   indifference. The Divine Leader is at work, and His gracious purpose is
   active even in the apparent inaction.

XV

THE MIDNIGHT PRESSURE

   THERE is something very weird and haunting about the midnight. It is
   one thing to be called out to visit the sick at noontide, but there is
   something awful when the call comes at the midnight. A telegram at the
   noon may be something or nothing, but a telegram in the stillness of
   the midnight is startling. And so we use the midnight as the symbol of
   our deepest and most desolate need. The majority of us have had
   experience of the season. The lights have gone out, and the soft,
   genial breeze has changed into a nipping night wind, and there is no
   companionable sound in the streets. We feel lonely and desolate and
   cold. And yet God's saints have had some wonderful happenings in the
   midnight. "Which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at
   midnight?" And countless numbers have turned to the heavenly Friend,
   and they have found wonderful light and provision in His presence. The
   Word of the Lord is full of song rising from the hearts of those whose
   night time has been changed into morning through their communion with
   the heavenly Friend. Here is a little chorus of praises: "Thou hast
   visited me in the night"; "In the night His song shall be with me"; "At
   midnight I will arise and give thanks"; "At midnight Paul and Silas
   prayed and sang praises." All these pilgrims of the night felt the
   pressure of the cold loneliness and they were driven to the heavenly
   Refuge and found the grace of God.

   But the very parable from which I have taken this sentence about the
   visit of the friend in the midnight seems to suggest that God may delay
   His bounty and that importunity is needed if we are to obtain His aid.
   Looked at superficially it would seem that the all-comfortable and
   self-engrossed friend was unwilling to arise from bed and give the
   loaves that were asked by the shameless knocker at the door. But the
   teaching is rather this: if continued knocking can overcome the
   surliness of a well-bedded friend, what will it accomplish when the
   Friend is the ever-ready, all-compassionate, and sleepless Lord? If
   continued prayer can overcome reluctance, how will it fare when it
   deals with goodwill? It is one of the "how much more "arguments of
   Jesus Christ. If your friend, snugly ensconced in his bed, and
   unwilling to go out in the cold night, and angry at being disturbed,
   will at length respond to your importunate knocking, "how much more
   shall your Father which is in heaven!" And, therefore, we are bidden to
   ask and to go on asking, to knock and to go on knocking, and the
   desires of our heart shall be satisfied.

   Why should there be any delay at all? Why does not God answer the first
   knock? First of all, let us again repeat the good news that our God is
   never imprisoned in sleepy indifference. He is awake and willing before
   we knock at all. Why, then, should we have to knock again? What is He
   doing? He is preparing the answer. There are some things we ask for
   that have to be grown. They cannot be given to us like coins or
   manufactured goods! They could only be given as fruits and they have to
   be grown in our souls. We ask for a fruit and the Lord immediately
   answers our prayer by planting a seed. We may think the prayer is
   unanswered, while all the time the answer is already working in our
   life towards consummation. We ask for certain blooms of finished
   character. The Lord does not attach them to our lives as we might tie
   fruit to a sickly tree. He begins at once to enrich the character that
   creates the blooms. For instance, I ask for joy. I expect to receive an
   immediate ecstasy. I ask the second time, but it does not come. My
   heart is sad in the midnight and there is no speedy transformation. But
   that does not mean that my Friend is indifferent or indolent. I ask for
   joy and He begins to make me a little purer and more refined. He works
   upon the strings of my soul and endows them with more sensitiveness,
   and by the preparation of the instrument He will prepare me for the
   final music and song. I ask for perfect peace. It does not come with
   the first asking, but the answer begins as soon as I knock at the door.
   There are broken cogs in the life that have to be repaired. There is
   much gravel of sin that has to be removed. And if the Lord is repairing
   some cog or cleaning some wheel, is not this the answer which will
   bring the peace for which I pray? It may be said that in order to give
   peace He may have to give pain. The resetting of a joint may mean the
   temporary increase of my suffering, but God is directing the process
   which will issue in blessing. But why keep on knocking, knocking; why
   keep on praying, praying? Why be importunate? Because importunity
   provides the atmosphere in which implanted seeds become matured. In
   prayer I receive the seed. By prayer I shall receive the fruit. Men
   ought always to pray, and the seeds will not faint.

   One thing must be added. Sometimes the Lord's answer has really come,
   but we have not prayed for eyes to see it. It has not come quite in the
   dress we expected, and, therefore, we did not know it. A friend was
   appointed to meet me at a railway station. He looked for a man in
   clerical attire, and we wandered about little knowing that we were
   brushing shoulders with each other all the time. He thought I had not
   arrived, but I was there in another dress. And, therefore, it is well
   to look at our ordinary circumstances when they do not come to us in
   familiar and expected guise. "He was in the world and the world knew
   Him not." God sometimes appears in these unexpected ways, but they are
   the very answers to our prayers. The Apostle Paul was cast down in
   Macedonia. "Without were fightings, within were fears." And the comfort
   came in a strange way. It was not given in some immediate lighting of
   the fires of joy, by some mysterious gift in his secret soul. "The Lord
   comforted me by the coming of Titus." That is where Paul found the
   answer to his prayers. A fellow-man came to share his burden and to
   enhance his joys.

XVI

CAPITAL AND INTEREST

   LIFE is very commonly regarded from the standpoint of an investment of
   capital which yields a certain amount of interest. It was conceived in
   this figure by the Lord Jesus Himself. "Trade ye herewith till I come."
   And what is our capital? What capital did the Master Himself invest in
   the affairs of men? He had a capital of thought, and He invested it in
   thoughtfulness. He had a capital of emotion, and He invested it in
   widest sympathy. He had a capital of conscience and ideal, and He
   invested them in the exploration and correction of crookedness. And He
   had a capital of will, and He always invested its power in the ministry
   of rectitude and truth. This was the sort of capital with which Jesus
   traded, and this is the kind of capital with which we are to trade amid
   the new opportunities of our own life.

   Now, in these realms interest is in proportion to the amount of capital
   we invest. Small investment will yield but small returns; if the
   investment be increased the interest will be correspondingly enlarged.
   Carelessness in the employment of life's capital results in dwindling
   and exhausted returns. This teaching applies to all kinds of interest,
   even that interest which we call our interest in things, our interest
   in persons, in causes, in common affairs. The interest we get from them
   depends upon the capital we put into them. And here I come face to face
   with a common statement which I desire to challenge, and which, indeed,
   is the theme of this meditation. Here is a man speaking about something
   or other, maybe a society, or a cause, or an institution, and he says,
   "I began to lose interest in it, and so I gave it up." Now I think the
   contrary is more likely to have been the truth. A close investigation
   will rather reveal that the man had begun to give it up and then lost
   interest in it. There was first an interference with the capital, and
   then the interest suffered. There was a relaxing in the trade, followed
   by impaired returns. This may appear to be a subtle, but it is a very
   vital distinction. The condition of finding interest in anything is the
   persistent and diligent application of strength. We begin to give a
   thing up, and then we lose our interest in it.

   We may find the application of the principle in the #230;sthetic realm.
   What is the condition of retaining a keen interest in music? It is the
   maintenance of an investment of capital. If we add to capital we
   assuredly add to the interest. The devotion of more time, more thought,
   more eager listening, and more diligent persistence, will result in an
   enriched and enlarged commerce, and the genius of music will pour her
   treasures into our souls. Charles Darwin ceased to invest in this
   realm; he gave no thought nor attention to music, and so he lost the
   power of appreciation.

   It is even so in the realm of art. The men who get most out of it are
   the men who put most into it. When John Ruskin began to examine the
   papers of Turner, he found at least twenty thousand slips, upon which
   the great artist had sketched all manner of initial themes. He was
   investing in ideas, and we have the results in his marvellous
   productions. Ruskin himself is an example of the same simple and
   universal law. In his preface to Mr. E. T. Cooke's "Guide to the
   National Gallery," he writes these words: "When I last lingered in the
   gallery before my old favourites, I thought them more wonderful than
   ever before." He was continually giving the strength of a finer quest,
   and he returned from his quest with richer discoveries.

   We may follow the application of the principle into the social realm.
   Even on the elementary plane of a subscription our interest is really
   born with our contribution. It is surprising what a little investment
   of this kind will do to create and quicken a man's attention. And if we
   increase our capital, our interest in the institution increases with
   it. If we begin to withdraw our contribution, the interest itself is
   withdrawn. In all social causes our humane interests are in precise
   proportion to our investments. If we put no thought into the condition
   of the inhabitants of the Congo, if we send no exploring sympathies
   among the downtrodden people of Russian cities and Russian wastes,
   there will be no interest, and these fellow-men will be as though they.
   had no place on the planet; but if we fix our thoughts upon their
   oppressions, and their woes, and their deprivations, if we settle our
   minds upon them, like invested capital, a great interest will waken in
   our souls, which will again expend itself in chivalrous endeavour and
   service.

   If we .ascend still higher into the affectional realm, into the home of
   holy love, we shall find that the gracious interest is determined by
   the quality of our investment. It is even so in the sacred relationship
   of husband and wife. The love of courtship is often larger and fuller
   than the love of married life, and it is simply because in the
   courtship there were more kindly courtesies and more reverent and
   constant devotion. It frequently happens that, when the wedded life
   begins, the delicate courtesies that prevailed before the. wedding are
   dropped, and life becomes grey and conventional. All of which means
   that capital has been withdrawn and the returns have suffered.
   Everybody knows how true this is in the relationship of friend and
   friend. If the capital of thoughtfulness is withdrawn, fraternal
   interest begins to drop. If two friends become divided by the waste of
   waters, it may chance that their letters become less and less frequent,
   and their courtesies more and more scanty, until the old profound,
   vital interest is almost dead. We begin to give up the friendship, and
   then the interest dies.

   And in the last place, the principle finds application in the highest
   of all regions, the spiritual realm. Many of us have so little interest
   in the things of the highest because we put no capital into them. We
   know perfectly well that if we put as little into anything else, say,
   into our business, or even into our pleasures, we should have no
   returns. Take the interest we derive from the Word of God. What right
   have many of us to expect any interest at all? We put nothing into it,
   and yet sometimes we expect an abundant return. We do not seek it as we
   should search for secret veins of gold; we do not diligently seek for
   it as for "treasure hid in the field." What have we invested in the New
   Testament? How much of thought, how much of imagination, how much of
   sympathy, how much of sheer will? From the standpoint of common trade,
   have we any right to expect returns?

   And I would include in all this meditation the means and ministry of
   prayer. Our interest in prayer is determined by the capital we invest.
   Look at the example of our Lord the Christ. "Rising a great while
   before day, He went up into a mountain apart, to pray." "He continued
   all night in prayer to God." "And as He prayed His sweat was as it were
   great drops of blood." Has our season of prayer any resemblance to
   these? Does it suggest energy and sacrifice, even to the point of
   blood? Are our intercessions weighted with purpose, and have we the
   demeanour of an armed man cleaving his way to some shining palace of
   gold? How much do we put into it? When a man speaks of losing interest
   in prayer, he had better raise the previous question as to the amount
   of capital he has withdrawn from the holy trade.

   Many of us have scarcely begun to pray at all. We have only played at
   praying. It has not been a mighty business; it has only been a harmless
   convention. We have put nothing into it, and therefore we have taken
   nothing out. We have "prayed amiss."

   Our primary concern must be with the capital, and God will attend to
   the interest. Let us invest, in all high and holy things, all our mind
   and soul and heart and strength. And there will be returned to us in
   holy interest and affection "good measure, pressed down, shaken
   together, and running over."

XVII

BRUISED REEDS

   THE Scriptures speak of some people under the figure of "bruised
   reeds." What is the significance of the figure? Think of it, first of
   all, as a broken musical reed. The shepherd boy cut a reed and turned
   it into a flute; and sweet music was reed music, mingling with the
   sound of the breeze on the uplands of the hills, and with the murmur of
   the pines! But if the reed were bruised and broken, if some beast had
   stepped upon it with heavy, heedless foot, and it lay there splintered
   and riven, how worthless the instrument! What shall the shepherd boy do
   with the reed that has lost its power to make a musical note? He will
   snap it and fling it away! He will "break the bruised reed."

   Now, there are men and women who are just like these broken natural
   flutes. They have lost the simple music of a sweet and human life. When
   their souls are breathed upon by the breath of God they are like a
   splintered reed, and they give no musical response. The breath wakes no
   bird-note of faith or hope or love. When their souls are breathed upon
   by the breath of human fellowship they are like a bruised reed, and
   there is no fraternal answer. They have lost their humanness, their
   rich, full sympathy with God and man.

   How do the reeds become broken? There are many ways in which the
   fracture may be made. The reed may be broken by the brutal tread of
   personal sin. A beast going down to the river to slake his thirst may
   crush a reed into the mire, and an appetite going out to drink may
   destroy the music of the soul. But the reed can also be broken by the
   heavy burden of grief and sorrow. We speak of a broken heart, a heart
   in which the singing spirit is bruised and silent. It is not uncommon,
   when some heavy calamity of woe has fallen upon a woman, to hear it
   said of her, "No one ever heard her sing again." The fragile reed was
   bruised and splintered.

   And again, the reed can be fractured by the nipping pressure of anxiety
   and care. The frost can crack a lute, and freezing care can chill "the
   genial currents of the soul," and break its music. "How can we sing the
   Lord's song in the land of the stranger," in a cold climate, where the
   soul-instrument becomes mute? In all these ways and in many others the
   fragile reeds can be bruised, and "the daughters of music are brought
   low."

   And what can we do with these "bruised reeds"? I will ask a larger
   question, in order to obtain a more heartening reply. What will the
   Saviour do with these "bruised lutes"? Well, He will not break them and
   finish their destruction. He will not discard and abandon them. He will
   not fling them away. He will restore the bruised reed. May we not say
   that He is the Physician of Broken Reeds, going about to restore the
   lost power of music and song? Unlike the shepherd boy, the Great
   Shepherd can mend the broken lutes. He can restore unto us "the joy of
   His salvation." Here is a familiar example. There is a lad with a life
   yielding a note like the mellow music of a fine, strong, musical reeds
   His life is whole and melodious, and no beast strides across his sacred
   place. And then some alien impulse lays hold of him, and he goes forth
   to "spend his substance in riotous living." The lute is sorely bruised.
   "He began to be in want." And how was he regarded by his fellows? "No
   man gave unto him." He was broken and rejected, broken and flung away!
   But let me hasten to the end of the narrative. "When the elder son came
   near the house he heard music." And what was that music? It was the
   restored music of the repaired lute, the love-song sounding again
   through the mended reed. "He hath put a new song in my mouth." It was
   the recovery of the lost chord. Thus our gracious Lord can deal with
   bruised reeds when they have been riven by sorrow or care or sin. "I
   will seek again that which was lost, and bring again that which was
   driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will
   strengthen that which was sick."

   But we may look again at the figure of the reed in the interpreting
   light of our Lord. Let us drop the suggestion of the musical reed, and
   regard it as just the swaying, pliable reed of .the desert. I think
   there may have been some proverbial phrase associated with the reed of
   the wilderness, and I think we catch a suggestion of it in the speech
   of our Lord. "What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed
   shaken by the wind?" The reed of the wilderness was used to describe a
   certain type and quality of life. The desert reed yielded before the
   wind; it was swayed, anyhow, any way, anywhere. It bent before the
   wind, from whatever quarter it blew, and became the type of frailty,
   fragility, pliability. But we are to add another characteristic even to
   this vivid symbol of impotence. It is not only a swaying, desert reed,
   but a "bruised reed," broken on its stem and withering at the fracture!
   Can we find an image more extraordinarily expressive of concentrated
   weakness?

   Well, now, there are people just like those desert reeds. They are the
   opportunists, yielding and bruised. They change their opinion every
   hour, until the very power of conviction is gone. They change their
   movements with the movements of the hour, until the very power of
   self-initiative is lost. They become bruised in the wind. What can we
   do with them? What do we do with them? In our folly we discard them. We
   despise them. We count them as worthless. We fling them away. But what
   will the Saviour do with human reeds, these playthings of the wind, the
   sport of caprice, the broken creatures of the passing hour? "He will
   not break the bruised reed." He will turn the bruised reed into "an
   iron pillar," and "out of weakness it shall be made strong."

   Here is a man "driven by the wind and tossed." It was said unto him,
   "Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth," but he denied, saying, "I know
   not, neither understand I what thou sayest." A poor bruised reed,
   yielding and breaking before the wind! But now listen to the risen
   Lord. "Go, tell My disciples and Peter." What is the significance of
   that word? It is the Lord at work on the bruised reed. "Simon, son of
   Jonas, lovest thou Me?" It is the Lord at work on a broken heart,
   giving it the gracious opportunity of recovery and of once again
   expressing itself in adoration and service. Look further on in the
   narrative. "When they saw the boldness of Peter." And what is the
   significance of that? It is the old, trembling, shaking reed converted
   into an iron pillar; it is discipleship made "faithful unto death."

INFIRMITIES IN PRAYER

   I WANT to consider some of the weaknesses which beset us when we
   commune with God in prayer. If we can clearly recognize our infirmities
   we may apprehend what is the promised ministry of the Holy Spirit. "The
   Spirit also helpeth our infirmities." I know I cannot go far along the
   road, for it soon passes into mystery and obscurity. But steadily to
   contemplate our weaknesses will surely reveal to us where the Holy
   Spirit will bring us needful strength. And in the enumeration of some
   of these infirmities I think I should first of all mention the weakness
   of appetite. We may realize this weakness if we contrast it with the
   strength of appetite revealed in other relationships. Take a man's
   appetite for business with all its keenness of strenuousness and
   intensity. Or take a man's appetite for pleasure, which is often as
   burning as the thirst of the fever-stricken. Or contrast our appetite
   for a novel with our interest in the things of God. When we turn to
   pray there is frequently no effective driving taste in our fellowship.
   And the taste for a thing is always a mighty dynamic. When our taste
   for anything is weak we loiter along the road, and we are oppressed
   with our own. weakness. So it is with our weakness of appetite in
   prayer. We are oppressed by comparative indifference, and in the sense
   of insipidity we play with the great concern.

   And there is a second infirmity which I will call our weakness of
   faith. We have no strong belief in our business. Real faith is a
   fountain of boundless energy. At Tobermory, on the west of Scotland, a
   little handful of men have a strong faith that a sunken galleon from
   the Spanish Armada is the prison house of great treasure, and their
   faith is productive of an energy which makes zealous quest. "Faith is
   the assurance of things hoped for." Faith acts mightily on the
   assumption that the thing hoped for is, and that the next step may
   bring us face to face with our goal. Have we this kind of faith? When
   we turn to God in prayer, do we turn to it with the quiet assurance
   that we are drawing near to a boundless treasury? Do we set about it as
   though our hands were upon mighty levers whose movement can effect a
   revolution? King George touched an electric button in London, and a
   gate swung open in Canada. A lever was turned in London and a
   Government House in Cape Town was flooded with light. When we pray to
   the Lord, does any analogous possibility thrill our souls? Have we
   faith that we can open closed doors, or that we can be the ministers of
   enlightenment even to souls that are far away? Surely one of our
   infirmities is our weakness of faith. We are not uplifted by the
   assurance that we are in touch with the possibilities of endless
   possessions.

   Another infirmity which I will name is the weakness of spirituality.
   Even when we go to the treasury we frequently ask for the smallest
   things. We do not honour the great God by the greatness of our quests.
   "We ask amiss." Suppose that I were to be admitted into a great
   library, and I were to be taken around by the owner and reader of the
   books, and suppose he pointed out to me their wealth of glorious lore,
   and the wonders of music, of vision, and of dream which they enshrined,
   and suppose he were to say to me, "Take whatever you like from my
   library," and I were to choose a wastepaper basket! Would not my
   request disparage the owner, and trifle with the wealth of his
   provision? Or if in some great studio the artist himself should point
   out to me the riches of perception, and the glory of workmanship in
   line and colour, and he were to offer me anything I pleased to choose,
   and suppose I were to carry away a picture-frame! But occasions that
   would be incredible in human relationships are quite common in our
   relationships with God. We ask Him for things that matter least. We
   neglect the things that are all-important. We emphasize the temporal
   rather than the eternal. We choose the earthly instead of the heavenly.
   We emphasize goods more than goodness, and we are more concerned with
   bodily health than with spiritual robustness. And all the time the big
   things are waiting, "above all that we can ask or think."

   And here is another of our infirmities when we seek to commune with
   God, our weakness of sympathy. There is little range in our
   intercessions. The liners on the high seas can now be contrasted by the
   wealth of their wireless equipments. Some equipments can only carry
   correspondence over exceedingly limited areas, while the greatest
   liners throw their mystic arms over enormous seas. A man's sympathies
   may be regarded as his wireless equipment. Some are pathetically poor
   and have no range beyond the circle of their own family life. Others
   may be sensitive ever the area of their own denomination. But powerful
   saints have an equipment which touches the joys and sorrows of the
   uttermost parts of the earth. Our prayers are determined in their range
   by the wealth or poverty of this equipment, and I think we may say that
   very commonly our sympathetic correspondences are dwarfed and scanty.

   And the last infirmity that I will mention is the weakness of
   understanding. Frequently when I pray I am face to face with problems
   to which I can see no solution. We cannot see all round the thing, and
   we "know not what to pray for as we ought." I am writing these words in
   the critical hours of the Balkan crisis. Just precisely how shall I
   pray about it? What would be best for Europe? What redistribution of
   powers will redound most to the glory of God? Here my understanding may
   be limited, and I pray without the requisite enlightenment. Well, in
   all these ways the spirit is encumbered by infirmity, and we are in
   great need of a mighty Helper. "The Spirit also helpeth our
   infirmities," and most assuredly He helps us in the midst of all the
   weaknesses of an enemy. Wherever the soul stumbles in its frailties,
   the Holy Spirit, if we permit Him, will bring the needful help.

   But more than all this I feel sure that the Holy Spirit strengthens the
   very prayers we make. For what weak things they are, even at the best!
   Perhaps my body is itself a hindrance. I have a hard day's work, and I
   am tired out, and I have scarcely the physical or mental vigour to fix
   my thoughts upon the Highest. My evening prayer is very weak, and has
   little promise of effectiveness. But surely just here the Holy Spirit
   will help my infirmities by adding strength to my petitions! Some
   signatures change weak appeals into conquests. If we can only secure
   the signature of a member of the Royal house, what urgency it gives to
   our plea! And perhaps in the mysterious depths of the soul our poor
   lame appeals receive the signature of the Holy Spirit, and He "maketh
   intercessions for us with groanings that cannot be uttered."

   And, finally, I think the Holy Spirit corrects our prayers. We may pray
   in our shortsightedness, and we ask the things that will bring no
   blessing. But the Holy Spirit, who knoweth the mind of God, puts aside
   our own petition and intercedes for what will bring us the gift of
   God's wonderful grace. The Apostle Paul prayed that he might be
   delivered from his "thorn in the flesh," but the Holy Spirit interceded
   for him, and while the thorn remained he received an all-sufficient
   endowment of the grace of God. And St. Monica, the mother of Augustine,
   prayed that her son might not be taken from her side. But the Holy
   Spirit interceded, and Augustine was taken to Italy, to Milan, to
   Ambrose, and to his life in Christ!

   And thus are we saved from the peril of our own limitations, and better
   things are given to us than we desired. Our Friend in Communion watches
   our interests rather than our words, and the gracious answer that comes
   to us is inspired by His understanding of all things, "yea, of the deep
   things of God."

THE FRIENDS OF JESUS

   I SUPPOSE that the greatest title ever conferred upon men was the one
   used by Jesus when He addressed His disciples as "My friends." Compared
   with this all other titles and nobilities are tawdry and artificial.
   They are as wax flowers and fruits in contrast with the sweet-perfumed
   loveliness of gardens and woods. They are like harsh, glaring stage
   effects set in contrast with the soft splendours of the dawn. An
   earthly dignity always carries with it a certain autumnal air, a
   suggestion of the fading leaf. The heavenly dignity is always
   significant of the eternal spring and the "never-withering flowers."
   "My friends." No other honour will ever come our way which for a moment
   can be compared with this.

   Let us for a, moment think who He is who confers the title. He is the
   "young Prince of Glory," the true expression and the subdued effulgence
   of God. These are familiar and perhaps well-worn words, and their
   sovereign superscription may have been partially effaced. Does it still
   awake the sense of wonder that the Prince of Glory walked the dusty
   ways of men? I remember reading years ago a quaint little book, written
   with daring and yet reverent imagination, in which the writer sought to
   express something of the limitless wonder of the angels when the Prince
   of Glory declared His purpose to leave the abode of light and enter the
   shadows and the darkness, that He might redeem the stricken
   earth-family from their sin. The imagination was certainly daring, but
   the awed spirit of the writer saved it from transgression, and he
   certainly conveyed some sense of the wondrous happenings in the unseen
   world when the beloved Prince set out to befriend the children of men.
   "The word was with God, and the word was God. All things were made by
   Him, and without Him was not anything made that hath been made." "He is
   before all things, and in Him all things consist." And this strong Son
   of God came to befriend the sons and daughters of men, and to seek
   their friendship in return. "Ye are My friends."

   And upon whom does He confer the title? Well, there is a couple of
   fishermen among them, James and John. He found them on the shore
   mending their nets. And there are two other fishermen, Simon and
   Andrew, also found at their humble toil. And there is at least one
   tax-collector, picked up at the very booth where the customs' dues were
   being paid. And there is another man, quiet, deep, and thoughtful,
   discovered in hungry reveries beneath a fig-tree. And these are types
   of the men the Prince of Glory gathered about Him. That is the first
   wonder of it. His friendship crossed all the hoary barriers of sex, and
   caste, and education, and possession

   and in a wide and glorious intimacy He sought and found His friends
   everywhere, among the learned and the unlearned, the high and the low,
   the rich and the poor. And the true aristocracy in that day, had it
   only been recognized, like the true aristocracy in our own day, did we
   only know it, are those who live in the intimacy of the Prince's
   presence and who have the rare and radiant distinction to be called His
   friends.

   Let us think a little while upon some of the characteristics of this
   great friendship; upon some of the distinctive signs of the friends of
   the Lord. First of all, then, this friendship is characterized by
   openness of disposition. Some lives are close and closed, and they
   appear to be almost incapable of friendship. You can never get beyond
   their doorstep. Their doors are shut, their windows are closed, their
   blinds are drawn. However long you know them they never let you know
   anything. Other lives are open to your approach, they open as a flower
   opens to the gentle siege of the sunshine. These are the people who are
   capable of friendship. One door after another opens out in the treasury
   of their soul. You are taken first into the realm of thought, then into
   the realm of desire and feeling, and then into the innermost room of
   prayer and praise. Concerning such a soul we say, "I know him through
   and through." And so it is with the friends of Christ. There is perfect
   openness between the soul and the Lord. There is openness on the side
   of the Master. He hides nothing we need to know. "I have set before
   thee an open door." All things that I have heard of My Father I have
   made known unto you." "He shall take of Mine and show it unto you." And
   there must be a similar openness on the side of man. "If any man open
   the door I will come in and sup with him." There must be no reserve, no
   sheltered secrets, no private chamber where questionable purpose is
   hid. The Lord must have the run of the house. He must know all. There
   must be perfect openness of disposition.

   And, secondly, this friendship is distinguished by a responsive
   sympathy. There must not only be open doors between two friends, there
   must be sympathetic fellowship. It was asked by a prophet long ago
   concerning man and his God, "Can two walk together except they be
   agreed?" If two people walk together they must agree at any rate on two
   things; they must have a common aim, and they must have a common pace.
   And the friends of Christ who seek to walk with Him must share His aim,
   His ends, His goals. They must also keep step with Him and not move
   either before or behind. We mar the friendship by precipitate haste,
   and we bruise it by destructive delay. And therefore I say that this
   high friendship demands a sensitive and responsive sympathy. There must
   be fellowship in aversions, there must be fellowship in attachments.
   There must be the same loves and the same hatreds. There must be the
   same fundamental moral tastes. We must agree on what is bitter, and we
   must agree on what is sweet. Friendship with the Lord aspires after
   that wonderful communion which the Master Himself described when He
   said, "I and My Father are one."

   And in the third place this friendship is marked by natural and
   unreckoned sacrifices. Friendship is never really noble and matured
   until on both sides it becomes unconsciously sacrificial. Friend must
   bleed for friend and not see the blood. There are three or four grades
   of friendship, beginning on an elementary scale which scarcely deserves
   the name of friendship at all, and rising into a glory of
   self-abandonment which makes us kinsmen of the Christ. On the lowest
   stage there is a friendship which only covets personal gain. It is
   there for what it can make out of you. On this plane friendship is only
   association. Love has not yet dawned, for the inmost heart and life of
   love is an impartation of self. On the second grade there is a
   friendship which gives, and which likes to display its gift. It loves
   to stand back and admiringly contemplate its own offerings. It is
   always conscious when it is giving, how it is giving, and the nature
   and price of its gifts. It is calculating and not spontaneous. It is
   never unknowingly generous, it is never unrememberingly bountiful, it
   is never gloriously and forgetfully prodigal of its own blood. It is a
   friendship which gives and which carefully registers the amount of its
   gifts.

   And thirdly there is the friendship that is unmindful of its
   sacrifices. This is a glorious type which, while it gives, has all the
   gracious feeling of receiving. In its sacrifices it is far more
   conscious of income than of expenditure; indeed, the sense of
   expenditure is almost altogether absent. "I was hungered and ye gave Me
   meat." "Lord, when--?" That is a lofty and radiant plane of
   achievement. Can any relationship be more intimate and gracious than
   for two friends to be pouring their life into each other and both of
   them, unconscious of any sacrifice? And yet perhaps there is even a
   further height on this glorious tableland of being when, in the
   unconsciousness of sacrifice, one man hungers for a deeper share in the
   sufferings of his friend. And that is the craving of the Prince of
   Glory towards you and me. He hungered and hungers to share our
   sufferings, to enter into our travail. "He bore our sins and carried
   our sorrows."


   In every pang that rends the heart

   The Man of Sorrows has a part.

   That must be our craving towards our Saviour-Friend. We must aspire to
   share His sufferings. It must be our coveted privilege "not only to
   believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake." We must enter into
   "the travail that makes His kingdom come." We must share His sufferings
   in fighting ignorance, in warring against wrong, and in proclaiming the
   evangel of love and grace to wayward and indifferent men. This is the
   high and priceless privilege of the friends of Christ.

   And now I have one bit of counsel to offer to those who are seeking to
   be the friends of the Lord. Keep your friendship with the Lord in good
   repair. There is a German proverb which says that "Friendship is a
   plant that we must water often." It must not be allowed to take its
   chance. Human friendships have to be tended, for there is no fair thing
   in the world which can thrive in an atmosphere of neglect. And
   therefore we must carefully attend to our friendship with the Lord.
   "Friendship should be surrounded with ceremonies and respects." Yes,
   even the wonderful liberties of friendship are helped by tender
   courtesies. So is it respecting our friendship with Christ. We must
   surround it with ceremonies and respects. I believe there is a way of
   kneeling, a way of going on one's knees, a way of rising from one's
   knees, which will enrich the intimacy of our freedom with the Lord.
   "Oh, come, let us worship and bow down."

   And as for the Master's side of the friendship, it cannot be put into
   words. "He is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother." He loves
   to make friends of the failure, the bruised, the unfortunate, and him
   that hath no helper. And He wants to befriend thee and me to-day, in
   all our sins, in all our sorrows, in all our worries, in all the
   manifold changes of the ever-changing day.

   His friendship transforms every road. Every road unveils spiritual
   wonders when He walks with us, and blessings abound on every side. The
   very consciousness of His presence begets a peace which is itself the
   medium of discernment, and we are able, on the most ordinary road, to
   know some of "the things that God hath prepared for them that love
   Him."

CONTACT BUT NOT COMMUNION

   HERE is a field, and here is the sower sowing the seed. "And some seeds
   fell by the wayside." And there the seed lies, pregnant with life and
   fruitfulness, but it cannot get into the ground. The vitalities in the
   earth and in the seed do not come into fellowship. The miracle of
   quickening and growing is nearly happening, but it does not happen. A
   harvest is all but at the birth, but it is not born. So near and yet so
   far! The seed and the earth touch, but they do not combine. There is
   contact, but no communion.

   And so it is, says the Master, in the field of human life. Great
   happenings may be exceedingly near and yet appallingly remote. Truth
   may be up against the soul, and yet there may be no fellowship. The
   human and the Divine may be in immediate neighbourhood; and there may
   be no acquaintance. We may brush against God and nothing more. The
   Divine may be as near the human as the seed to the wayside ground, and
   still there may be no apprehension. There may be contact, but no
   communion.

   And so this appears to be the character suggested in the Master's
   words. There is a soul in touch with truth, but not free; in touch with
   life, but not alive; in touch with God, but not sharing the nature of
   God. God is near, but the soul does no business. Hands touch, but they
   do not clasp in holy covenant. There is contact, but no communion.

   It is true in the realm of our material environment. God is immediately
   near in His created world. There is a mystic Immanence which touches us
   on every side. The desert furze-bush is inhabited by holy flame. Every
   common place is the home of Deity. "He rideth upon the wings of the
   wind." "The clouds are His chariots." We may call this poetry, if we
   please, but we do not banish it from the realm of reality. Men and
   women of sensitive spirit are aware of a ubiquitous tenant, of an
   august Presence lighting up the plainest road. God is very near. We are
   touching Him every moment. But there may be touch and no perception, no
   fellowship, no inter-passing of relations, no vital correspondence.
   Tremendous happenings may be near the birth, but nothing is born.

   It is equally true in the mystic realms of conscience. The truth in
   conscience is immediately near to me, as near as the seed that rests
   upon the wayside. The Divine is in contact with the human. What may we
   do with it? First, we may not recognize it. It may be a, seed just like
   many other seeds which have been wafted to us on the wings of the wind.
   God's saying is mixed up with other sayings. His decree is lost amid
   the maxims and expediencies of the world. His truth is buried among
   human guesses and opinions. Or, in the second place, we may give the
   distinguished Presence in conscience an undistinguished name. We may
   use some word that will encourage us in lax familiarity and
   indifference. The Prince of Wales has been given a college name in
   Oxford, in which all Royal significance is concealed. It is a
   hail-fellow-well-met name, in which the coming King becomes an ordinary
   man of the street. Thus may we act with conscience. We may give it a
   trifling name, and then begin to trifle with it. We may strip it of its
   imperial purple, and clothe it in a common dress, and then take
   liberties with it. We may call it a "bogey," and laugh it to scorn.
   Yes, we may say "bogey," and dismiss it to the delusive shades. Or,
   thirdly, we may just take the truth into the vital powers of life. We
   may receive the heavenly Presence and entertain it. We may take the
   truth into the realm of judgment, to determine our decisions. We may
   take it into the realm of the will to determine our actions. And so we
   may fashion the life in the holy likeness of God. What shall we do with
   the truth? Shall we take it in and assure a harvest, or shall we leave
   it out and assure a desert The seed touches! Shall it be only contact
   or communion?

   Mark again how the Word of the Lord applies to the secret exercises of
   worship. When we meet together for public communion God is near, how
   near we cannot express. We cannot help but touch Him. We are brushing
   against Him in every moment of the sacred hour. I say we cannot help
   the contact, but we can refuse the communion. There may be interest but
   no reverence. There may be graceful postures, but no sterling homage.
   When we bow to pray there may be touch, but no grip. In the feast of
   the holy sacrament we may handle the bread, and so touch the very hem
   of His garment, and yet there may be no sacred union. We may go away
   from the service in the assumption that we have had communion when we
   have only been in contact with the Lord. The seed touched the wayside,
   but it was not taken in.

   Once again see how the teaching is illustrated in the realm of common
   circumstances. The Lord who visited the home at Bethany still comes to
   the homes of His people. The Lord who worked in the carpenter's shop is
   still in the centres of labour and business. And the Lord of the
   evening feast at Emmaus is still a guest at the common meal. In all our
   customary circumstances the holy Lord is near. We cannot help but touch
   Him; do we commune with Him? In the sacrament of the common meal, the
   Lord is with us at the table. "Thou knowest my downsitting and mine
   uprising." "He was made known unto them in the breaking of bread." He
   may be so near and yet He may be far away. He may never be counted
   among the guests. His presence may be ignored. The common meal may be
   graceless, thankless, Godless, with no enrichment or suggestion of
   things which are Divine.

   And so is it also in the sacrament of common labour. God moves to and
   fro among our common tasks. He is with us in the gift of bread, and He
   is with us in the processes by which we earn it. He is lovingly
   concerned about our daily toil, and He would hearten and enlighten the
   worker by the strength and comforts of His grace. And yet how truly do
   we know that the workshop may have nothing of the savour of the temple,
   and may be regarded as profane. The seed is near, but not in the
   ground. The Lord is near, but not in the soul. And yet the promise
   abides: "He shall be with you and shall be in you."

   Happily, thrice happily, this alienation can be ended by the exercise
   of our own choice of will. The very desire to receive the truth draws
   the seed into the secret place of the soul. The will to commune means
   that communion has begun. When I kneel in sincerity I am opening the
   door to the heavenly guest: "If any man will open the door I will come
   in and sup with him and he with Me." That is the promise of the Master;
   it has never been re-yoked; it has never been unredeemed. There is no
   unwillingness on the part of the Lord; the unwillingness rests with us.
   "If thou wilt!" That is the challenge of the Master; and the willing
   soul will discover the Lord in the innermost room of the soul.

THE MORNING BREEZE

   IN Walter Pater's "Marius "there is an exquisite description of the
   impression produced upon him by his first fellowship with a Christian.
   The Christian was Cornelius, a young noble, a soldier of the Twelfth
   Legion. "With all the severity of Cornelius there was (at the same
   time) a breeze of hopefulness--freshness and hopefulness--as of a new
   morning about him." This delicate phrase, "the breeze of morning," came
   into my mind as I was reading Paul's letter to Timothy, and the account
   which the great apostle gives of the helpful ministry of his friend
   Onesiphorus. The Apostle says, "He oft refreshed me," and the
   suggestion is that of the coming of a current of fresh air, a reviving
   coolness after heat. This obscure disciple was like Cornelius who
   ministered to Marius, and he brought renewal of spirits to the great
   Apostle of the Gentiles. His was the ministry of the morning breeze.

   Now it is a significant thing that the Apostle needed the refreshment.
   He had his seasons of fainting when the spirit grew distressed. What
   could there be in his life to hold his soul in gloomy servitude? There
   is no depression like that which waits upon natures that are intense.
   The passionate are familiar with depths that are unknown to the
   temperate. And Paul, with all his burning enthusiasms, had his moments
   of faintness. For one reason, there was the undying mistrust of the
   ultra-conservative Jews. They suspected the genuineness of his
   apostleship. They suspected the orthodoxy of his message. From end to
   end of his life this vigilant and often malicious mistrust hung around
   about his soul. And of all things that can come to a messenger of
   Christ, there is nothing more wearing and wearying than a spirit of
   mistrust. It chokes you. It smothers you. It makes you faint.

   And then, for a second thing, there was the corruption breaking out in
   the young Churches he had newly planted. To a man with high ideals
   these rude realities would occasion deep depression. I was with a
   gardener a little while ago, who was taking me round the garden-beds,
   and pointing to one little plot where almost every flower seemed
   touched with blight, he said, "It is very disheartening." And when the
   Apostle Paul looked over his garden plot at Corinth, and saw how the
   fair flowers were smitten with moral blight, he became depressed and
   faint.

   And, thirdly, there was the contemplation of his own slow progress in
   the world of the Spirit. "The prize of the high calling "seemed far
   away, and like more obscure disciples he would sometimes feel as though
   the journey were scarce begun. In the seventh chapter to the Romans we
   have glimpses of the Apostle when this mood was upon him, and when he
   needed all his reserves to keep going. Well, in these ways and in
   others, he came to times of depression when his fainting soul was in
   need of refreshment.

   And in these times of fainting God sent His messenger with the morning
   breeze. Onesiphorus was a bringer of fresh air to the faint. It is
   beautiful that an obscure disciple could be the minister of refreshment
   to a great apostle. The ventilator in a room is often an exceedingly
   plain article, ungainly, when contrasted with more luxurious things
   around, but it is the medium of refreshment, the channel through which
   the air travels, that makes life easy and pleasant. And humble people
   can be the channels of the heavenly birth to greater people who are
   faint. Every minister knows such folk in his congregation. They are not
   heavily endowed with treasured attractions. They have neither gifts of
   culture nor of wealth, but they are makers of atmosphere. They make it
   easier for other people to breathe.

   I wonder what windows Onesiphorus opened to let in the morning air upon
   the fainting spirit of the Apostle? Perhaps he directed him to some
   forgotten promise, some word stored with heavenly energy which the
   great Apostle had forgotten. When Bishop Butler was dying there came a
   moment of faintness over his soul, and an obscure chaplain who was in
   the chamber, whose name is not given to us, reminded the Bishop of some
   dynamic promise of the Master, and his spirit was refreshed. Or,
   perhaps, Onesiphorus would mention to the Apostle some exploit in his
   ministry of which he had never heard: "Let me tell you what happened at
   Ephesus after you had gone away. Let me tell you what happened to
   so-and-so after he had listened to your message about the heavenly
   love." And Paul would listen and listen until the faintness gave place
   to hope and quiet trust. Or, perhaps, again Onesiphorus would retrace
   the pathway of the Apostle's life, and point out to him unremembered
   mercies which were scattered like flowers along the road; or he would
   show him how past difficulties had been surmounted by the powers of
   grace, or how other seasons of depression had been fruitful because the
   barren desert was in reality a garden of God. Or, once again
   Onesiphorus might dip into his own history and bring forth testimonies
   to the triumphant power of Eternal Love. He would diffidently bring
   forth his own witnesses, and the story would be as morning air to him
   who was sick and faint.

   Well, now, this kind of service is the one that is most needed in the
   Church of Christ. We want people who carry atmosphere and are ministers
   of refreshment. And such people will instinctively go where the
   ministry is most required. It is a beautiful lineament in the character
   of Onesiphorus which is given in the Apostle's phrase, "He was not
   ashamed of my chain." The great scholar, and convert, and saint, and
   apostle was held in servitude, but we know what a name he gave to his
   chain. He called it "my bonds in Christ." He linked his very servitude
   to the Lord. He took his restrictions, his limitations, his
   impediments, and surveyed them in their association with the Christ.
   But a man's chain often lessens the circle of his friends. The chain of
   poverty keeps many people away, and so does the chain of unpopularity.
   When a man is in high repute he has many friends. When he begins to
   wear a chain the friends are apt to fall away. But the ministers of the
   morning breeze love to come to the shades of night. They delight to
   minister in the region of despondency, and where the bonds lie heaviest
   upon the soul. "He was not ashamed of my chain." The chain was really
   an allurement. It gave speed to his feet and urgency to his ministry.

   And is not this the very friendship of the Lord Jesus? He is not
   ashamed of our chains. When He was with us in the flesh He amazed
   people by His familiarity with the victims who were held in bonds. "He
   is gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner." He was not ashamed of
   his chain. "He eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners." Their
   chains did not repel Him. "He remembereth us in our low estate." He
   brings the ministry of refreshment to those who languish in prison. "He
   is the Lord of the morning to the children of the night."

NO BREATH

   "THERE was no breath in them." There was everything except breath. They
   were perfectly articulated bodies, but they were devoid of inspiration.
   The organized bones were as impotent as when they lay scattered over
   the desolate fields, organization had accomplished nothing. The lack
   was vital. There was an absence of life.

   And this, says the prophet, is the symbol of a common tragedy in the
   lives of men and nations. Movements stop just short of inspiration.
   Fine organizations have no soul. There is "noise" and there is
   "shaking," but there is no quickening wind from God. There is
   combination, but no communion. Bone comes to bone, and there are sinews
   and skin, but there is no air, no enlivening power from the heart of
   God.

   We may find an illustration of the prophet's symbol in the domain of
   words. A dictionary is a valley of dry bones. It is a mass of
   dismembered words scattered like dislocated bones, every word isolated
   from every other word, lying there bleached and dry. Well, a man thinks
   himself to be a poet, and he comes to the dictionary, and he begins to
   gather the words together "bone to his bone." He joins them in the
   friendliest concord. He organizes them in metrical rhymes. Every law of
   grammar and metre and melody is honoured. The association is sweet and
   soft and orderly and--dead! It is a beautiful corpse, but there is no
   breath in it; it jingles, but it is not poetry.

   Or we may go to the verbal valley of dry bones, and we may gather the
   scattered members together and construct a prayer, fitting bone to
   bone, giving it sinews and covering it with flesh and skin. And there
   it is, a decent orderly thing, but dead! We say our prayers, but we do
   not pray. We marshal our words, but we do not aspire. We present a
   corpse instead of a breathing. And here is a poor publican, with a
   meagre little handful of words, which he sobs out rather than repeats:
   "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner," and "the words stand up an
   exceeding great army," and they take the kingdom of heaven by storm.

   Sometimes we go to the dictionary, the valley of dry bones, and we
   gather its words together to construct a creed. The articles of the
   creed are most carefully shaped and fitted together with exquisite
   association. Word is joined to word in precise succession, and sentence
   linked with sentence in exact logical agreement. It is strengthened
   with the sinews of philosophy, and furnished with the flesh and skin of
   tender emotion, and there it is, an organized statement of belief! And
   we may repeat it with the semblance of life. There may be a "noise" and
   the "shaking," but no inspiration, no aspiration, no lowly confession
   of trust or prayer; and the mystic unseen ministers, who watch the
   souls of things, proclaim the heavenly judgment, "there is no breath in
   them." Another man gropes for a little handful of words, and fits them
   uncertainly together, and stammers them out before the Lord: "Lord, I
   believe, help Thou mine unbelief." And the Kingdom is taken.

   In the Church that bears the name of Christ we may have everything but
   the essential thing. We may have order and decency and reverence, and
   the appearance of fraternity. Bone may come to bone, and there may be
   the sinews and even the flesh and skin, and yet there may be no
   pervading breath, no mysterious and unifying life. We may have a
   congregation, but not a communion; we may have an assembly, but not an
   army; we may have a fellowship roll, but not of those who are counted
   alive, and whose names "are written in the Lamb's Book of Life." We may
   be just a crowd, and not "the family of the living God."

   We may have prayers, but no prayer. We may have petitions, but no real
   intercession. We may have posture and homage, but no supplication. We
   may have exquisite ritual, but no holy worship. We may have what men
   call "a finished service," and yet there may be nothing of the violence
   of a vital faith. We may have benevolences, but no sacrifice. We may
   have the appearance of service, but no shedding of blood. The Church
   may be only an organized corpse.

   But when the breath comes, how then? The breath of God converts an
   organization into an organism, it transforms a combination into a
   fellowship, a congregation into a church, a mob into an army. That
   breath came into a little disciple-band, a band that was worm-eaten by
   envy and jealousy, and weakened by timidity and fear, and it changed it
   into a spiritual army that could not be checked or hindered by "the
   world, the flesh, and the devil." And when the same breath of God comes
   into a man of "parts," a man of many faculties and talents, sharpened
   by culture, drilled and organized by discipline, it endows him with the
   veritable power of an army and makes him irresistible. "And Peter
   filled with the holy breath!" How can we compute the value and the
   significance and the power of that unifying association? Peter himself
   becomes an army, "an army of the living God." If the Church were filled
   with men of such glorious spiritual endowment, what would be the tale
   of exploits, what new chapters would be added to the Acts of the
   Apostles?

BLINDING THE MIND

   THERE is a phrase of the Apostle Paul which contains a warning
   peculiarly relevant to the times through which we are passing. It is
   this: "The god of this world hath blinded the minds." What is the
   significance of the phrase, "The god of this world"? Here is a certain
   evil influence personified. A certain immoral energy or contagion is
   conceived and presented as an active, aggressive, personal force, which
   deliberately seeks to dwarf, and bruise, and lame the richly-dowered
   souls of men. He is elsewhere depicted as of princely line, with
   imposing retinues and armies, moving stealthily amid human affairs, and
   inciting men to rebellion against the holy sovereignty of God. He is
   represented as "the prince of the powers of the air," subtle and
   persuasive as an atmosphere, insinuating himself into the most sacred
   privacies and invading even the most holy place. He is "the god of this
   world," receiving homage and worship, the god to whom countless
   thousands offer ceaseless sacrifice, while the holy Lord of grace and
   glory is neglected or defied. I am not now concerned with this
   personification, whether it be literalistic or merely figurative; but I
   am concerned with the reality of the power itself, whose seductive
   energy corrupts our holiest treasures, and blunts and spoils the finest
   perceptions of the soul.

   Now, everybody is familiar with the characteristics of this destructive
   ministry. There is no need of abstruse or hair-splitting analysis. The
   issues are obtrusive; we have only to examine our own souls and their
   besetments, and the peril is revealed. We may have dropped the
   personification, but we recognize the energy which is personified. We
   may have abandoned the figure, but we are familiar with the thing. We
   may no longer speak of "the god of this world," but "worldliness"
   itself is palpable and rampant. This is our modern phraseology. We
   speak of "the worldly" and "the unworldly," but unfortunately the terms
   are very loosely and indefinitely used, or used with a quite perverse
   significance. The "unworldly "is too often identified with the
   "other-worldly," and is interpreted as an austere isolation from all
   festivity, and from the hard, hand-soiling concerns of practical life.
   And on the other hand, "worldliness" is too often identified with
   gaiety, or levity, or prodigality, with drink and pride, with
   theatrical glamour and vulgar sheen. But these interpretations do not
   touch the heart of the matter. What, then, is worldliness? Worldliness
   is life without ideals, life without moral vistas, life devoid of
   poetic vision. It is life without the halo, life without the mystic
   nimbus which invests it with venerable and awful sanctity. It is
   imprisonment within the material, no windows opening out upon ethereal,
   moral, or altruistic ends. It is the five senses without the moral
   sense. It is quickness to appetite and dulness to conscience. It is
   engrossment in sensations, it is heedlessness to God's "awful rose of
   dawn." It is rank materialism.

   Now this powerful contagion operates in the deprivation of sight.
   Materialism and moral blindness stand in the relation of cause and
   effect. "The god of this world hath blinded the minds." That is to say,
   a practical materialism destroys the eyes of the soul. The
   materialistic life deadens the conscience, and in the long run puts it
   to death. The materialistic life stupefies the imagination, and in the
   long run makes it inoperative. The materialistic life defiles the
   affections, and converts their crystalline lens into a minister of
   darkness and night. The materialistic life coarsens the spiritual
   instincts, and renders them non-appreciative of things unseen. And so
   it is with all the vision-powers of life; a practical materialism plugs
   or scales them and makes the spirit blind.

   But I will still further narrow the interpretation, and confine this
   article to that aspect of worldliness which is concerned with the bare
   pursuit of material gain. If "the god of this world" must be given a
   single name, let the name be Mammon, and let the love of money be the
   worship which is offered at his shrine. And does the god of money blind
   the mind? Let it get into the pulpit, and everybody knows the result.
   The spiritual heavens become opaque, and there is no awe-inspiring
   discernment of "things unseen." Everybody recognizes its
   destructiveness in the ministry, but everybody does not equally
   recognize the destructiveness in other lives and other professions. But
   the moral issues are one and the same; always and everywhere the god of
   money blinds the mind.

   Let me give a Scriptural illustration of its nefarious work. A woman,
   who had been spiritually enfranchised by the Lord, and who had been led
   out of the dreary, wan land of sin into the fair, bright lily-land of
   God's eternal peace, brought an alabaster box of ointment, very
   precious, and anointed her Deliverer's feet. And there was one standing
   by, who looked upon it with uninspired and unillumined eyes, and said,
   "To what purpose is this waste?" . . . "This he said . . . because he
   was a thief, and carried the bag!" He was the victim of the god of
   money, and he was blind, and he could see no beauty or grace in this
   passionate love-offering of an, emancipated child of God. There was
   nothing winsome about the woman that he should commend her; and, more
   than that, when he looked upon the woman's Lord there was "no beauty"
   that he should desire Him! "What will ye give me, and I will deliver
   Him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of
   silver." And for that "thirty pieces of silver" he sold his Lord! May
   we not add, "the god of this world" had blinded his mind?

   But there is no. need for us to go back to those remote days for
   illustration of the truth. Every succeeding century has abounded in
   confirmation of its truth. But let me confine myself to witnesses from
   modern history. I know of no more shameful page in the history of our
   country than the page which tells the story of our early demeanour in
   the American Civil War. The North was valorously intent upon lifting
   the tyranny of the South, and letting the bond-slave free. And vast
   multitudes of our people sympathized with the callous and slave-holding
   South, and ranged themselves in bitter antagonism to the chivalrous
   North. And what was the explanation? Just this, they were unable to see
   the interests of humanity because of their interests in cotton. They
   couldn't see the slave for the dollar, or they saw him only as a
   chattel to be despised. Henry Ward Beecher came over to expostulate
   with our countrymen, and to seek to open their eyes. He came here to
   plead for the slaves--those slaves unveiled to us in the bleeding pages
   of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." He came to Liverpool. Now listen to a
   contemporary document and you will think you are reading the Press of
   the past few weeks. "It would be impossible for tongue or pen
   adequately to describe the scenes at the meeting. The great hall was
   packed to the crushing point. The mob was out in force. The
   interruptions were incessant: cat-calls, groans, and hisses." And at
   what part of the meeting did the disorder culminate? It was when
   Beecher, bit by bit, got out these sentences and rammed them home:
   "When I was twelve years old, my father hired Charles Smith, a man as
   black as lamp-black, to work on his farm. I slept with him in the same
   room. (Oh! oh!) Ah, that don't suit you. (Uproar.) I ate with him at
   the same table; I sang with him out of the same hymn-book; I cried when
   he prayed over me at night; and if I had serious impressions of
   religion early in life, they were due to the fidelity and example of
   that poor, humble farm-labourer, black Charles Smith. (Tremendous
   uproar.)" What think you of the significance of that uproar? They saw
   no moral dignity in Charles Smith that they should desire him. That
   Liverpool mob could not see the slave because they were so intent upon
   the dollar.

   Read the chivalrous history of the good Lord Shaftesbury. In his early
   manhood, when he began his noble crusade of emancipation, women and
   girls were employed in coal-mines, as beasts of burden. Their condition
   haunted him, and became a nightmare which possessed him day and night,
   and he set about to ameliorate their lot. He sought to prohibit their
   employment. With what result? The mine-owners were up and in arms. "It
   spells ruin to our trade!" They could not see the degradation for the
   gold. They feared a shrinking purse more than a shrunken womanhood.
   They could not see the woman for the bank. But Lord Ashley disregarded
   their cries, and at length he had the supreme happiness of putting a
   stop to this infamous sort of labour by an act which declared that,
   after a certain limited period, no woman or girl should ever again be
   employed in our collieries and mines.

   When Queen Victoria came to the throne, a dispute with China was
   developing into a very ugly menace. Soon after it broke out into open
   war. And what did we fight about? We fought for the right of Great
   Britain to force a destructive trade upon a people who did not want it,
   in spite of the protestations of its government, and in spite of all
   such national opinion as could find a public expression. There was
   money in it for Britain, there was revenue in it for India, and
   therefore China had got to have it! It is China's burden, China's
   curse, China's appalling woe, and still we force it on her. And the
   explanation is clear. We cannot see the evil for the revenue. We cannot
   see the wasting victim for the swelling exchequer. Some day Britain
   will get the gold-dust out of her eyes, and then she will see--she will
   see the reeking opium dens, and the emaciated manhood, and the
   devastated families, and the blighted race, and in her shame she will
   wash her hands of the traffic, and decree the emancipation of a people.
   At present, money plugs the eyes.

   And there is very great need that in our own day we deliver ourselves
   from the servitude of this mammon. In our day, when the Spirit of God
   is at work in our midst, inciting dissatisfaction and unrest, and
   creating a ferment among the peoples, our vision and our sympathy can
   be dulled and checked by the common love of money. The peril is
   insidious, and it invades even the most holy place. The spirit of greed
   dwells not alone among the wealthy and the well-to-do, it can make its
   home with people of slender means. What we need, above all things, is
   to have our eyes anointed with the eye-salve of grace, that so our
   vision may be single and simple, and we may have the mind of Christ.
   What we need is unscaled sight, and with unscaled sight there will come
   fresh and healthy sympathies, and an eager participation in every
   chivalrous crusade.

THE SOUL IN THE MARKET

   I USE these words, "The Soul in the Market," to characterize the second
   temptation of our Lord. Here is a soul face to face with the supreme
   enemy of souls. The enemy of souls creates in life the atmosphere of
   the market. He proposes a transaction in the nature of an exchange. He
   suggests a bargain and makes an offer. What are the terms? What does he
   offer? "The kingdoms of the world and the glory of them." What does he
   ask in return? The worship and service of the soul. "If Thou wilt fall
   down and worship me." That is to say, he offers a temporality and
   demands a spirituality. He offers a reputation and demands a character.
   He offers a great "spread," but insists upon a stooping soul. He offers
   a show of liberty, but his terms are spiritual servitude. He offers
   possessions, but the price is degradation. He proposes a profitable
   exchange, and for the treasures of the soul he offers the treasures of
   the world. Make him supreme monarch in the empire of the soul, and he
   will make us kings in material domains. That is the essential bargain.
   The soul is in the market in Vanity Fair.

   Let us inspect the character of the temptation a little more closely.
   The air was filled with the rumour of a coming king and of the
   restoration of kingdoms. Everywhere was the sense of thrill and
   expectancy. Men's eyes were scouring the horizon for one that should
   come. And now excitement was intensified, for there had appeared by the
   Jordan a desert prophet with the old authoritative word and mien,
   proclaiming the news of the King's coming, and the Kingdom of God was
   at hand. The King had left His palace! He was on the road! "Prepare ye
   the way of the Lord."

   And what did they expect to see? They looked for a king who should be
   clothed in the mysteries of unshared powers, before whom the kingdoms
   of the world would lie prostrate in awed and affrighted obeisance. He
   was to be a sort of Prospero, with invisible Ariels at his command,
   going forth on his decrees to charm or to paralyze, to bind or to free.
   The coming king would set up the throne of his glory in Jerusalem, the
   place of his presence would make the grandeur of empires sombre; he
   would have his feet upon the neck of kings, and he would lay their
   valiant ones in the dust. "Then cometh Jesus, and the devil taketh Him
   into an exceeding high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the
   world, and the glory of them, and said unto Him, All these things will
   I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.'"

   Let us mark the subtlety of the snare. Think how much the young
   Nazarene might accomplish by the possession of a carnal rule. He could
   ride abroad redressing human wrongs. He could strike the weapon from
   the hand of the oppressor. He could destroy the tyranny of iniquitous
   taxation. He could lighten the burden of the poor. The sovereignty of
   kingdoms would give Him the ministry of freedom, and wherever men were
   in servitude, He could lead them into glorious liberty. "All these
   things will I give Thee!" What are the terms of the exchange? "If Thou
   wilt fall down and worship me." The devil is seeking his exchanges in
   the region of the soul. He is seeking them in the realm of spiritual
   homage and posture, in the secret place of worship and ideal. "Alter
   thy soul posture. Readjust thy secret homage. Change thy spiritual
   inclinations. Dilute the stringency of thy holiness. Change thy
   heavenly principles for loose expediencies. Change thy impossible
   ideals for working compromises. Change thy clear, straight sight for
   winks and nods and wiles. Change thy serene wisdom for sharp subtlety.
   Change thy unvarnished truth for the oil of flattery. Make more of
   appearances. Let life be more a game, a scheme, an artifice, and less
   of an exalted crusade. "All these things I will give thee, if thou wilt
   only play my game. Thou shalt appoint the goal, but mine shall be the
   way to reach it. Thine shall be the end, but mine shall be the means."
   Such were the terms of the proposed exchange.

   And the answer? The Master's answer came sharp, immediate, peremptory,
   and absolute: "Get thee behind Me, Satan!" Our Master would not change
   the inclination of His soul by the shadow of a turning. He would not
   deflect His steps by a hair's breadth from the path of holiness and
   truth. To gain kingdoms and the glory of them He would not haul down
   the holy flag waving on the citadel of His soul. He would not worship
   in the house of Rimmon. He would not wipe out the Ten Commandments and
   write ten corn-promises in their place. He would not exchange the fair,
   clear, sunny ideals of the Divine hills for the will-o'-the-wisps of
   "the world and the flesh and the devil." "Get thee behind Me, Satan,
   for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
   shalt thou serve."

   Let no one imagine that with the defeat of this temptation the same
   temptation never returned. If I interpret the Master's life aright, the
   temptation returned again and again, with precisely the same
   enticements, always changing its attire, but always with the same
   motive, and armed with the same destructive quest. The Lord was always
   being tempted to use illicit means in the interests of the heavenly
   kingdom, to take forbidden ways to apparently legitimate ends. We have
   an instance of the return of the temptation when He was enticed by His
   own brethren to worship at the loud, garish altar of egotism and
   self-display. "If Thou do these things, show Thyself to the world."
   Copy the ways of the world and make a noise! Advertise Thyself! He
   would have none of it. "He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any
   man hear His voice in the street."

   There is a further example of the return when Simon Peter sought to
   entice his Lord to take the easy road and to seek His throne by the
   flowery path of comfort. "Then Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him,
   saying, This shall not be unto Thee.'" And the Lord again answered with
   the sharp response He made to the first temptation, "Get thee behind
   Me, Satan." Christ would have no illicit compromises. He would make no
   bargains with indolence. He would offer no incense at the altar of
   worldly wisdom. "He set His face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem," and
   He walked the thorny, flinty road to Calvary and the Cross, and this
   was His one response to all alluring besetments by the way: "Thou shalt
   worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve."
     __________________________________________________________________

XXV

TERMINUS AND THOROUGHFARE

   ONE of the most deadly temptations in life is to mistake a thoroughfare
   for a terminus, and to regard what is intended to be a means as an
   ultimate end. When we make a material thing a terminus we only exist;
   when we make the material a thoroughfare to the spiritual we begin to
   live. And, therefore, one of the determining questions in life, where
   subtle snares abound, is this: Shall the material be a terminus or a
   thoroughfare, a goal or a passage, a means or an end? Shall we seek to
   live "by bread alone," or, using bread as a subordinate means, shall we
   find our true life in the unseen? And here is the Saviour's answer. We
   live not in material things or in material quests, but in Divine
   relations. "This is life, to know Thee." By "bread alone" the body can
   exist; man needs the bread of the world; he can only live by the hidden
   manna of Divine communion.

   Consider the reach of this principle in the light of one or two of its
   multitudinous applications. Apply the principle to nature, to our
   association with the wonders of the natural world. Our temptation is to
   dwell on the material side of nature, and never apprehend the spiritual
   significance of the Divine world. We stop at "bread"; we do not push
   through to God. There is a type of man to whom nature makes no sort of
   refined appeal. He seems to be insensible to its presence. His powers
   are held in a kind of benumbment. There is a second type of man who
   discovers in nature higher ministries of physical inspiration and
   delight. His senses are gratified. He is charmed by the play of colour,
   he is fascinated by the minstrelsy of song, he is exhilarated by the
   delicacies of flavour and perfume. There is a third type of man who
   rises to an aesthetic appreciation of nature. He exercises artistic and
   poetic discernment. Imagination is now at work, and delicate fancy, and
   a world of romance is unveiled. Idylls are born and lyrics are sung.
   But there is a fourth type of man who has a spiritual apprehension of
   nature, who holds communion with its spiritual world, who uses it as a
   thoroughfare to the Divine, who passes by its "bread," giving thanks
   for the bread, to find the true significance in God. He moves with awed
   and wondering soul through "the light of setting suns" to "the light
   that never was on sea or land," and through the apocalypse of the
   changing clouds to "the rainbow round about the throne." The outer
   bread conducts him to the hidden manna, and behind the world of the
   senses he discovers the world invisible, incorruptible, and full of
   glory.

   Let us further apply the principle to our conception of history. It is
   possible to approach history and to abide in its outer courts it is
   possible to go further, and in history to find "the Word of God." We
   may have a materialistic conception of history, and when we survey its
   crowded procession we may see only the contention of material forces,
   and in its changing triumphs we may see only the changing ascendency of
   the brute. We may have a spiritual conception of history, and behind
   all its perspiring tumults and noise and armies and brutal riot and
   disorder we may discern a spiritual presence and hear a ghostly word,
   the word "proceeding from the mouth of God." In my own schooldays the
   learning of history was the memorizing of bald and innutritious dates,
   or we were ceaselessly watching the glamour and pageantry of kings and
   queens, or we were following the doings of armies and gazing upon
   rivers of blood. Since those days our attitude towards history has
   changed. We are not so much concerned with the fittings of monarchs as
   with the movements of peoples, not with the life of the palace but with
   happenings in the cottage, not with the growth of armies but with the
   growth of freedom.

   But even with this revived attitude we are still outside the temple,
   and may still be tempted to abide in its material and social passages,
   and not press through to God. What is God saying in history? What is
   "the word proceeding from the mouth of God"? What is He saying in the
   history of the empires of the ancient world? What is the speech of
   events? What is the clearly defined word of results and destiny? In
   this way we are to press through the garish shows of things, past the
   sheen and the pain and the blood, and we are to listen to the eternal
   word of the living God.

   But the principle may not only be applied to the history of nations but
   to the record of the individual life. What is the Divine word in my own
   past life? Let me get through to that. I shall be tempted to take an
   unspiritual view of my own past. I shall be inclined to fix upon its
   cleverness, or its want of cleverness, or its fortune, or its
   misfortune, its luck, or its chance. I shall be foolish to stop there.
   It is the way of wisdom to push through the material, the outer
   furniture and equipment and to get into the secret room and hear "the
   word proceeding from the mouth of God." What does He say to us through
   our yesterdays? "He that hath ears to hear let him hear."

   So have I tried to show how the principle may be applied to nature and
   to history. It might be similarly applied to ordinary duty, to its
   outer halls and its inspired secrets; to common work, its outer form
   and its spiritual significance. Indeed, the principle has range of
   application to all the manifold relations and interests of human life.
   Everywhere we are tempted to make a terminus of what was intended to be
   a thoroughfare, to stop at "bread," and not get through to God. We are
   snared to stop at the material, the formal, the ritualistic, the
   symbolic, and we thereby miss the life indeed, and the heavenly bread
   that alone sustains it. We are enticed to remain in the outer halls of
   being, and we miss the secret room where is set the appointed feast.

   The snare is about us when we meet for worship. We meet as immortal
   souls. The enemy of souls is present to entice the immortal to be
   satisfied with the material, the formal, the musical, the sensational,
   with the rites and rubrics of worship, and to have no concern for a
   personal communion with God. He seeks to make us contented with forms
   and postures, to make the hymn and the anthem and the sermon a terminus
   and not a highway by which we find "the secret place of the Most High."
   It is our daily wisdom to have the snare in mind, and to reject all
   enticements that keep us from our rightful inheritance in the heavenly
   places in Christ Jesus.

THE DESTRUCTION AT NOONTIDE

   THERE is a peril in the garish day. There are destructive things that
   are only bred in the long-continued splendour. They awake and prowl
   about in the noon. In the deep shadows of the. deeper night they sleep
   in impotence. "It is the bright day that brings forth the adder." A.
   summer of unbroken sunshine is not the invincible guardian of the
   public health. It favours some forms of disease. It may generate a
   lassitude which gives disease its chance. The glare may become the ally
   of infirmity.

   And now I can see the significance of the psalmist's words, "the
   destruction that wasteth at noonday." A secret consumption may make its
   home in the realm of the sunbeam. Our radiant successes may house our
   most awful foes. Our prosperity may be like some sun-drenched realm in
   the tropics--the hunting-ground of the plague. It may be we were safer
   in the grey, chill twilight of precariousness and uncertainty than we
   are in the steady brightness of a cloudless noon. We were, perhaps,
   more secure when a little fear was in our life than we are when the
   last shadow of care has melted away.

   Now what perils are these which hide themselves in the brightness of
   noon? What enemies emerge in our prosperity? I think that one of the
   first perils of the noontide is the eclipse of the spiritual relations
   of life. The sunniest days are not the best for the discernment of far
   distances. There is a haze in the fierce light that veils the remote
   horizon. And when our life attains to its burning noon we are apt to
   lose the land that is very far off. The large relationships of things
   are eclipsed. Our eyes are lured from the further issues, life's
   ultimate goals. We become the prisoners of the immediate hour. The
   things of sense hem us round about, and the transient becomes our all.
   It is amazingly difficult to keep sight and hold of the eternal when
   the immediate hour is so brilliant. The very pomp of success seems big
   enough to satisfy, and we do not want the long vision of the things
   that endure. And thus we lose them. And yet we are so mesmerized by the
   present glare that we are not conscious of the loss. I have seen a
   child so fascinated by a glittering toy that its mother could leave the
   room and never be missed. That is a subtle peril of life's brilliant
   noon. We may become so absorbed as not to miss the God we have lost.
   The glitter of gold can make us forget the glory of God. Some earthly
   prize dazzles us, and "the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
   Jesus" is blurred. And all this is "the destruction that wasteth at
   noonday."

   Another great peril of our noontide is a narrowing of the sympathies.
   In the fierce glare of summer the rivers shrink in their beds. And in
   the sunny season of triumph and prosperity the streams of our sympathy
   are apt to grow scanty as in a time of drought. Cloudy, rainy days
   refresh the springs. Sorrows keep the emotions moist and fluent. Defeat
   makes us very sympathetic. The obituary columns have a new significance
   when our own family has written a record there. We look at a cripple
   with new eyes when one of our own is lame. But when no clouds have
   passed across our sky we are very prone to lose communion with the
   children of night. At any rate, that is our peril. When we are
   prosperous we become encased with pride, and pride is a non-conductor,
   and the vibrations that beat upon us from the gloomy house of sorrow
   are never perceived. We can become "past feeling," and lose our
   correspondence with our fellow-men. The noonday may be a minister of
   alienation between man and man.

   And a third peril of the noonday is what George Adam Smith calls "the
   atheism of force." The successful man is prone to magnify might without
   reference to right; carnal power becomes the treasure to be desired.
   Success is life's end, and success is its own justification. Be like a
   cow! Trample down a thousand wild flowers and river grasses to get your
   drink, but get your drink! To get on is the aim. Never mind about
   getting up! And so life loses its ideals, its dignities, its
   elevations. It loses the vertical and becomes merely horizontal. It has
   ambitions, but no aspirations. It has push, but no worship. It has
   belief in expediencies, but it loses its belief in God. Instead of
   "worshipping the Lord, thy God, with all thy strength," it worships the
   strength of self. And this is one of the subtlest perils of the noonday
   of success. In our pride we raise our altar to our own right arm. "By
   the strength of our own hand we have done it."

   There is only one security from these perils. It is "the secret place
   of the Most High." In that secret Presence we dwell under the cooling
   shadow of the Almighty! There will be no haze with our heat. No
   earth-born cloud will veil the Supreme. Our great God will be to us as
   "the shadow of a great rock," and we shall not be dizzied in the
   burning noon of our prosperity and triumph. We can be successful and
   yet be safe, but the secret is with God. "He shall not fear men when
   heat cometh." "The arrow that flieth by day" shall never reach his
   soul. In the noonday he shall be immune, for "the mouth of the Lord
   hath spoken it."

   The strength of God's grace has been triumphantly manifest in men and
   women who have spent years in the sunshine. Prosperity has beamed upon
   them, but they have remained unspoiled. Success after success has
   poured its radiance around them, but the graces of their spirit do not
   fade. Some protective air seems to wrap them round about, a defence
   against the fierceness of the favouring beams. They are defended by the
   ministries of the Holy Spirit. They can have ease and not be wasted.
   They can even be wealthy and yet be in the kingdom of humility and
   peace. They can "pass through the fire and not be burned," for in the
   fire there is One with them "like unto the Son of Man," and they walk
   unscathed.

XXVII

THE BENEDICTION OF THE SNOW

   THE student of the Word of God, and, indeed, the student of human life,
   is greatly impressed with the amazing variety of the Divine processes
   in the culture of the soul. "As the rain cometh down and the snow from
   heaven and watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud. . . ."
   These two ministries, so strangely contrasted--the rain and the
   snow--are equally the friends of the bountiful harvest. That rain
   should be linked with the harvest I can quite well understand; but one
   is startled with the range of the vision which connects the snow with
   the ripened seed. It is reasonable that the delicate dew should be
   related to the delicate bud, but it is a larger outlook that connects
   the frosty night with the opening leaf. It is a congenial thought which
   links the wooing zephyr with the yellowing grain. But here the kinship
   is made with the cutting blast. Here we are shown the relation of ice
   to the waving corn! It is this breadth of the process, comprehending
   such startling contraries, that makes one see the variety of the
   discipline in the Divine culture of the individual and the race.

   The rain provides a most beautiful figure of the softening ministries
   of grace. It is a fitting expression of the tender mercies of our God.
   The rain is typical of all the gentle, genial providences, the April
   weather of mingled sunshine and shower. We have all known these
   seasons, for we have all experienced them, the seasons when God's love
   has played upon us like rain upon the hard ground, and when "the barren
   ground has become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water." No
   Christian disciple has walked along with the Master, and especially in
   times of sore affliction, without the knowledge of that gentle
   consolation when God "comes down like rain upon the mown grass."

   But the snow, too, is in the process of Divine culture. There is a
   place for the frost, the chill, and the winter. The snow is an apparent
   foe to the purposed bud and seed. It is repressive rather than
   expressive. It seems to be the minister of death rather than of life,
   hastening decay rather than promoting growth. And yet the snow is the
   servant of the harvest. It "cometh down from heaven," it "maketh the
   earth to bring forth and bud." And thus it is that the cold, cutting
   discipline in life, for which the snow provides the symbol, is also a
   servant of the spiritual harvest, and generates and nourishes the
   flowers and fruits of the perfected life.

   Sometimes we can see quite clearly how the harvest of the soul has been
   helped by the frost and the snow. Winter possesses a life. The grey
   days come and the cold, dark nights. And then some grace appears, some
   fine reverence, some chaste reserve, some beautiful modesty, some
   violet of the spirit, like crocus or gentian revealing itself under the
   melting coverlet of Alpine snows. It was not there before the snow had
   fallen, but now it lifts its lowly head before the face of an approving
   heaven. Let me quote one or two examples of spiritual graces and
   purposes which have been gendered and nourished beneath the snow robe.
   Here is one: "Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept
   Thy word." Something was born in the severities of affliction; the
   virtue of fidelity was nourished in the wintry day. And here is
   another: "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might
   learn Thy statutes." Here is a faculty that is strengthened by the
   frost. Affliction adds to the man's worth. The grace of refined
   perception was found in the day of the falling snow. There is a third
   suggestive example in the life of Hezekiah: "In those days was Hezekiah
   sick unto death." The gloom of affliction settled upon his soul; the
   snow was falling! Now, if we turn to the day when the winter is over,
   we shall find "flowers appear on the earth." Listen to this word when
   Hezekiah was recovered of his sickness: "I shall go softly all my
   years." The snow brought the flowers of delicacy and gentleness and
   considerateness, and never again would he break the bruised reed.

   And here is the Apostle Paul, full of love, full of ardour, burning
   with passionate quest in the service of his Lord. He was an Apostle of
   the Kingdom, and through his ministry the evangel of grace was being
   carried from city to city, from land to land, from clime to clime. He
   was a glorious sower of the heavenly seed, and there was promise of
   rich and bountiful harvest. And then the snow began to fall. Cruel,
   biting blasts blew about his ministry. The evangel appeared to be
   icebound, and the evangelist himself was held in servitude in Rome. Now
   turn to the record, to the words written while the snow was yet
   falling: "The things that happened unto me have turned out rather unto
   the furtherance of the Gospel." Again we have a harvest helped by the
   wintry day. Expansion is gained from the agent of apparent restriction.
   The frost is the nurse of multiplying growth.

   Let me give one other example taken from the more general fields of
   literature. I find it in that great passage in Shakespeare where
   Cardinal Wolsey is passing out of the glory and pomp of carnal grandeur
   into the cold wintry gloom of isolation and neglect.


   Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!

   This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth

   The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,

   And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;

   The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,

   And--when he thinks, good easy man, full surely

   His greatness is a-ripening--nips his root,

   And then he falls, as I do.

   The frost has come, the snow is falling! But is that the end, a
   blighted, stricken, withered life? Let us read again: "I feel my heart
   new open'd." The frost is the minister of the opening, the snow is the
   servant of a quickened life. Let me read once more:

     Cromwell: How does your grace?

     Wolsey: Why, well;

     Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
     I know myself now; and I feel within me
     A peace above all earthly dignities,
     A still and quiet conscience.

   And so I say the snow is the minister in the development of the Lord's
   design. If we had no snow in our lives there would be no chivalry, no
   springs of tenderness, no brimming rivers of noble compassion. If there
   were no snow I am afraid there might be no violets, and life would not
   attain those holy graces which shone in the life of the Son of God. "He
   learned obedience by the things that he suffered." If the soul had no
   winter it might miss its intimate vision of God.

NEEDLESS REGRETS!

   "IF Thou hadst been here my brother had not died." That is a Scriptural
   example of a very familiar experience. It illustrates a most
   commonplace form of grief. It is an example of needless regrets. "If
   Thou hadst been here my brother had not died." If we had arranged
   things a little differently, how different might have been the issues!
   If we had taken another turning, what a contrast in our destiny! If
   only we had done so-and-so, Lazarus might have been with us still! My
   readers will recognize the familiarity of the utterance. It is the
   expression of a common human infirmity. Its sound travels through the
   years like the haunting sigh of a low moan. "If only . . . !" "If only
   . . . !" And the pathetic cry is with us to-day. It is usually born on
   the morning after a crisis, and it sometimes continues until the
   plaintive soul itself goes home to rest. It is a sorrow that consumes
   like a gangrene. It drains away the vital strength. If by some gracious
   ministry it could be ended, and the moan changed into trustful
   quietude, an enormous load would be lifted from the heart of the race.
   Men and women are being crushed under needless regrets. And here is one
   of them: "Lord, if Thou hadst been here my brother had not died!" It
   was a regret that shut out the kindly light of the stars which God has
   ordained should shine and cheer us in our nights. I wish, therefore, to
   look at the incident with the utmost simplicity, in the prayerful hope
   that similar burdens may be lifted from the hearts of some who may read
   these words.

   It was a beautiful friendship which united the Lord with the family at
   Bethany. Their home was very evidently one of His favourite resorts. He
   turned to it for its friendly peace. Perhaps He found in this little
   circle a love that was not tainted with interested ambition. Perhaps He
   found a friendship that sought no gift and coveted no place. Perhaps He
   found a full-orbed sympathy, unbroken by suspicion or reserve. Perhaps
   He found a confidence which was independent of the multitude, and which
   remained quietly steadfast whether He moved in public favour or in
   public contempt. At any rate, Jesus was at home "in the house of Martha
   and Mary," and here all unnecessary reticence was changed into free and
   sunny communion. He loved to turn from the heated, feverish atmosphere
   of fickle crowds to the cool and restful constancy of these devoted
   friends. When the eyes of His enemies had been following Him with
   malicious purpose, it was spiritually recreating to look into eyes that
   were just quiet "homes of silent prayer." After the contentions of the
   Twelve, and their constant disputes as to who should be greatest, it
   was good to be in this retired home where friends found love's reward
   in love's sacrifices, and the joy of loving in the increased capacity
   to love. It is therefore no wonder to read, as we do so frequently,
   that "Jesus went out to Bethany."

   And now a darker record begins. "A certain man was sick, Lazarus of
   Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha." We know.
   nothing about Lazarus, except that Jesus loved him. Not a single
   lineament of his character has been offered to our imagination. And
   yet, somehow, I feel as though I know him well. He was one of those
   glorious men about whom our modern Press could scarcely compose a
   single readable paragraph. He was a gracious, lovable nobody. He was a
   "home-bird." He was a lover of the fireside. He was a beautiful
   commonplace. He did nothing except live a noble life. He was one of the
   nobodies whose presence constitutes the very sanctity of home. And he
   was sick.

   What will the sisters do? They know of the Saviour's mysterious power
   over sicknesses. They had heard of it; they had probably seen it.
   Should they send for Him? Lazarus would not hear of it! These good
   souls never will. Said Lazarus: "He has got something better to do than
   trouble about me. Trouble not the Master. Let Him go on telling His
   good news unto men." And the sisters heeded their brother. But he grew
   gradually weaker, and they took counsel together, perhaps unknown to
   their forbearing patient. And then a sort of compromise was born which
   paid respect to their brother's wish while giving expression to their
   own. "We won't exactly ask Him to come! We will just send Him the news
   and leave the decision to Him." "The sisters therefore sent unto Him
   saying, Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick."

   What will the Master do? Surely He will haste with all speed to the
   stricken home! He will take comfort where He has so often received it.
   He will lift the burden where the burden has been so often lifted from
   Him. "When therefore Jesus heard that he was sick He abode at that time
   two days in the place where He was." It was one of those mysterious
   delays which so often burden our life. There were the sisters in
   Bethany, waiting, wondering, saddening. Will He never come? Has He
   forgotten? "Then after this He saith to the disciples, Let us go into
   Judaea again." And so He came to Bethany, but it was too late. Lazarus
   was dead.

   "If Thou hadst been here! If only we had sent two days earlier! If only
   we had done it without consulting our brother! If--if--if only!" This
   is, I say, a type of needless regret. It was a retrospect which
   darkened sorrow. It added a deeper gloom to the night. And it was all
   so gratuitous, so needless, so unwise. Why should they now go back, and
   fetch remorse from yesterday, and load their heart to the point of
   bursting?

   And the same remorseful "if" rankles in human life to-day. How often I
   have heard it when loved ones have been taken away. Poor laden hearts
   have added to their burden by their sharp regrets. "If we had only gone
   south instead of north." "If I had taken the first illness more
   seriously." "If I had only got her away when she began to grow tired."
   "If I had only given up that engagement." "If I had never gone away."
   "If we had called in the doctor earlier." And so the poor, weeping
   souls moan on as if our God was dead.

   And how often I have heard the wail when some choice or enterprise has
   apparently failed. "If we had only put him into a trade instead of a
   profession!" "If only we had put him in a profession instead of a
   trade!" "If only we had never sent him away from home!" "If only we had
   taken the other alternative!" "If only we had listened to this man's
   counsel instead of that man's counsel!" "If only! If only!" Or perhaps
   there is some decision concerning ourselves about which we have now
   become uncertain when it is too late to make a change. We thought about
   it, we took counsel about it, we prayed about it. Then we acted, and
   now we think we see. "If only I had waited another week!" "If only I
   had taken the first post that offered!" "If only I had been contented
   with good instead of fondly looking for better!" And so there comes a
   seeming "after-wisdom." We assume that we are "wise after the event."
   Our lamp is now burning, but it has been kindled too late, and its only
   use is to reveal to us our tragic and irremediable mistakes.

   Now in the case of Martha and Mary the remorseful regret was altogether
   needless. "If Thou hadst been here!" But He had been there all the
   time. He had been with them in deepest sympathy, in kindly thought, in
   gracious intention, in tender and yet ample plan. What they were
   thinking to be a lamentable mischance was a vital part of a larger
   scheme, begotten and inspired by unfailing love. They had scarcely, if
   ever, been out of His mind since He heard the news. There was no need
   for regret; everything was just . exactly right.

   And so it is with most of the "ifs," the remorseful "ifs" that ravage
   and devastate our peace. If there be a personal devil, who makes it his
   work to sow seeds of unhappiness and discord and unrest, multitudes of
   these "ifs" must be of his unholy planting. And for this reason. They
   destroy filial trust; they destroy spiritual peace; they destroy the
   wide sweeping light of Christian hope. The devil sows these needless
   regrets, and the thorns choke the good seed, and our spiritual harvest
   is starved or destroyed.

   And even supposing we have made mistakes, and we would dearly like to
   have the choice back again that we might take the other turning, what
   then? Who is our God? And what are His name and character? Cannot He
   knit up the ravelled bit of work, and in His own infinitely gracious
   way make it whole again? With all our mistakes we may throw ourselves
   upon His inexhaustible goodness, and say with St. Theresa, "Undertake
   Thou for me, O Lord."

   It is the very gospel of His grace that He can repair the things that
   are broken. He can reset the joints of the bruised reed. He can restore
   the broken heart. He can deal with the broken vow. And if He can do all
   this, can He not deal with our mistakes? If unknowingly we went astray,
   and took the wrong turning, will not His infinite love correct our
   mistakes, and make the crooked straight?
     __________________________________________________________________

XXIX

WISE FORGETFULNESS

   IT was a wise and comprehensive prayer which the old saint offered when
   he said, "Lord, help us to remember what we ought not to forget, and to
   forget what we ought not to remember." Our memories are very defective,
   arid very erratic, and very unsanctified. Oliver Wendell Holmes said
   that "Memory is a crazy witch; she treasures bits of rags and straw,
   and throws her jewels out of the window." And memory remains capricious
   even when life has entered into the highest relations and has made a
   faith-covenant with the eternal God. We forget the way the Lord our God
   has led us. We forget all His benefits. We forget that we were
   "cleansed from our old sins." The remembrance of His mercy sometimes
   goes clean out of our mind. Memory has some very big holes, and some
   big things drop away into oblivion.

   But just now I want to consider the other aspect of her vagaries, her
   careful hoarding of things which she ought to throw away, the diligent
   remembrance of things which ought to be forgotten. There are some
   things for which we need mnemonic aids; there are other things for
   which we require mnemonic an#230;sthetics. If at some times the memory
   needs refreshing, at other times there is dire need of spring cleaning
   when her rubbish can be swept away. The full sanctification of memory,
   while it will vitalize some relationships, will surely destroy the
   sensitiveness of others.

   It would be a blessed thing if we could lose the remembrance of our
   injuries. For one thing, the sense of injury is aggravated by
   remembrance. A spark is fanned into a flame, and "behold how great a
   matter a little fire kindleth." And in that fire it is our own
   furniture which is consumed. Some very precious furnishings of the soul
   are burned to ruin: Self-reverence and self-control are destroyed.
   Gentleness and modesty wither away like the undergrowth in a forest
   fire. Indeed, every power in life is damaged, even conscience herself
   being seared. But apart from these moral damages, what an uncomfortable
   guest this is to entertain in one's remembrance! She keeps us
   continually ruffled and feverish. She fills the chambers of .the soul
   with heaviness and gloom. She despoils us of the sweet sunshine of
   grace, and she sours every feast. Why should we keep her? Above all,
   why should we give her so much attention? For when she absorbs the
   attention the Lord Himself is eclipsed. If this bitter resentment could
   just become incarnate, and in visible ugliness could sit with us at our
   table, we should very speedily order her out of the house. If memory
   could lose her we should have great gain. If only we could forget her
   we should more clearly remember the Lord.

   And then some of us are unwisely remembering our forgotten sins. There
   is the sin of a far-off yesterday, of which we have repented, and which
   we have confessed, and which the gracious Lord has forgiven, and yet we
   turn to it again and again with heavy and unrelieved heart. We go back
   and dig it up again when the Lord Himself has buried it, and when over
   its grave He has planted fair heart's-ease and lilies of peace. If ever
   we do return to those fields of defeat we ought to pluck a little
   heart's-ease or bring back a lily with us, that we may testify that
   where sin abounded "grace doth much more abound." There ought to be no
   room in our memories for the heaviness of forgiven sin. "His banner
   over us is love," and that banner is waving over the entire realm of
   our yesterdays if we have sought His pardoning grace.

   Some people carry too vivid a remembrance of their beneficiaries. They
   are continually rehearsing to themselves the detailed story of their
   benefactions. In memory they pass them from hand to hand and back
   again, letting their right hand know what their left hand doeth. They
   had much better forget them. It is spontaneity that gives our
   ministries their worth, and a spontaneous character quickly throws off
   the remembrance of past services. The well is ever bubbling up anew,
   and the waters of yesterday are forgotten. Yes, it is spontaneity that
   makes our services fresh and refreshing. But self-consciousness,
   especially when it wears the smile of self-satisfaction, seeks to win
   commendation and reward, and so its real beneficence is stricken at the
   heart. When we begin to gloat over our goodness men begin to see that
   it is a trick and they will know that it is not the fruit of the tree
   of life. "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness to be seen of
   men," and we surely may add "nor to be seen of self." Forget them!

   I will mention one other matter where a defective memory would be for
   our good--the matter of past attainment. It is possible so to hug our
   past triumphs that we never get beyond them. We may so linger with our
   success that we become satisfied, and have no aspiration for anything
   beyond. And thus it is literally true that some men's chains are found
   in their achievements. They have sat down in their victories, and
   life's progressive march has ceased. It was surely on some such peril
   as this that the Apostle was looking when he proclaimed his strong and
   positive determination to forget "the things that are behind." He used
   the figure of the racer who had covered part of the course, but whose
   goal was yet ahead. And the racer would not permit himself to turn and
   gaze upon the ground already run, still less to sit down and
   contemplate it with satisfaction. He would forget his present
   attainments in the quest of something better beyond. But we are always
   in peril of stopping in the midst of the course and seeking attainment
   in partial triumph. We have had a good spurt; let that splendid spasm
   do for the race! Or to change my figure, we are satisfied to win a
   battle, and we become indifferent about the campaign. Our satisfactions
   are premature. We fondle what we have done, and we are drugged by our
   successes into degeneracy and retrogression. Our minds must be filled
   with the vision of the fields that are yet to be won. "Glories upon
   glories hath our God prepared." Let us feel the call and the allurement
   of the days before us, and press on to the apprehension of their hidden
   treasure.

   The grace of God is our provision for the sanctification of the memory.
   Perilous remembrances will be avoided if we are possessed by "the grace
   of the Lord Jesus." His grace is a "savour of life unto life," but it
   is also "a savour of death unto death." It can put things to sleep that
   ought never to have awaked. Apart from the grace of the Lord we have no
   sufficient power to hallow the memory. Mere effort will not avail. It
   is conscious communion with the Lord that ultimately transforms the
   consciousness. It is by the fulness of His might that all the spaces of
   the soul become realms of beauty and dwelling-places of eternal truth.

PREJUDGING CHRIST

   "DOTH our law judge a man except it first hear from himself, and know
   what he doeth? "But that is Christ's fate every day and all the days.
   He is judged from hearsay. Men will not come face to face with Him and
   "know what He doeth." In the days of His flesh the Pharisees judged Him
   by extraneous standards. What was His birthplace? "Out of Galilee
   ariseth no prophet." What were the range and quality of His rabbinical
   knowledge? What heed does He pay to the customary ritualistic
   practices? "He eateth with unwashed hands." "Thy disciples fast not."
   The ordinary habiliments of the popular sect were wanting, and,
   therefore, He was despised and rejected. And these are typical examples
   of the prejudices through which many men looked at the Lord. It is the
   characteristic of a prejudice that it is small and. yet it produces
   monstrous perversions. A tiny obliquity in a lens can make the outlook
   grotesque. A small prejudice can so distort our vision of the Master
   that "when we shall see Him there is no beauty that we shall desire
   Him."

   And small prejudices lead to great misjudgments in our own day. A man's
   opinion about the Church is allowed to fashion his relationship to the
   Christ. Some professing Christian has broken his covenant and betrayed
   his Lord, and, therefore, the Lord Himself is forsaken. Or men recoil
   from some phrase in a credal statement of the faith, and they turn
   their back upon the Lord of life and glory. Through churchianity many
   men interpret Christianity, and it is difficult to get them to come
   with a "fresh eye" to the contemplation of Christ. "Doth our law judge
   any man before it hear him?" Most assuredly this is the prejudgment
   which many men call conviction.

   What is the right way of judging the Christ? First of all, we must
   bring the right implements. We must consecrate to the quest the medium
   of a sensitive heart. It will not suffice that we spend a week in
   worldliness and sin and then set about to give an hour's consideration
   to the claims of the Lord. It will be impossible to see even a sunset
   truly on those terms. The heart that is befouled by unclean living is
   in no condition to estimate aright the glory of the Lord.

   And then, in the second place, we must bring an open mind. Every blind
   must be up and every window opened. We must be perfectly candid and
   sincere in our approach. It is not enough to have a clean lens on the
   telescope--we must take the cap off! A man must strenuously rid himself
   of all perverting prejudices and draw near to the Lord with a single
   desire to see Him as He is. And to this end we must, in the third
   place, bring an alert imagination. We cannot vividly realize a page of
   ordinary history if our imagination is dormant or dead. If we are to
   see the movement of a past day in all its life and colour our
   imagination must be awake and active. Now this is peculiarly true when
   we come to the story of our Lord. All our powers must be surrendered to
   the quest, and more especially this talent of the imagination by which
   we recover the vitalities of yesterday and realize them as though we
   were in the very movements to-day.

   And with this equipment we must "hear Him." We must hear Him patiently
   and hear Him through. We must hear Him concerning God, concerning
   Himself, concerning ourselves and our brother. We must listen to Him as
   He speaks of life, and love, and duty, and death, and destiny. We must
   listen while He tells us what we are and what we may be, and by what
   ministries of grace the transformation can be effected. But we must
   also know "what He doeth." We must pass from His words to His deeds,
   from a quiet listening in the oratory to the contemplation of His
   doings in the laboratory of the great world. We must investigate His
   work upon others and see what He has done. For instance, we must look
   at the man whose river of life was like the flowings of a sewer and
   which is now cleansed and pure as crystal. We must regard the other man
   whose will was like a trembling reed, and which has been converted into
   a resoluteness like the strength of an iron pillar. We must study His
   work in the gay, fast woman of the world who has been transformed and
   transfigured into a strong and gracious saint. Yes, we must honestly
   "know what He doeth." And we shall not have gone far in the search
   before our souls begin to bow in that wonder which is the parent of
   love and praise.

   But this is not enough. If we are to lay aside every prejudice, and all
   that has hindered a true and full knowledge of the Lord, we must
   investigate His work upon ourselves. That is to say, we must convert
   inquiry into experiment. I cannot understand men and women passing the
   years in wordy controversy concerning Christ and never submitting His
   claims and promises to the severe and serious test of personal
   experience. Surely it is one of the first marks of candour in all our
   relationships to the Christ, to see if His word works, and if by the
   fulfilment of His conditions we ourselves are brought into the promised
   possession of peace and joy. Let a man sit down to the New Testament.
   Let him with clean, sincere eyes search out the requisite conditions of
   a conscious relationship with the personal Power of the world. Let him,
   if need be, write them out, and set them before him. Let him make them
   his maxims for the government of his life by day and night. Let him
   make test if there is anything in them. Nay, rather let him test if
   there is anything in Him. Let him experiment for twelve months. Let him
   do it with humility and reverence, earnestly desiring to know the
   reality of things behind the veil, and he shall assuredly feel the
   presence and the power of the Eternal. What will happen? The miracle
   will happen which has been wrought in innumerable lives. The man's
   heart will begin to be purified. The man's mouth will begin to be
   cleansed. His eyes will begin to be radiant with vision. His sympathies
   will put on chivalry and the joy of sacrifice. He will know that his
   Redeemer liveth.

   Surely this is the way of honest inquiry. Let not a man be made the
   slave of unillumined prejudice. Let him not govern his life by hearsay
   and rumour. Let him be content with nothing second-hand. Let him seek a
   first experience of the things of the Highest, and the Highest will not
   leave him in the lurch.

RIVERS OF LIVING WATER

   "HE that believeth on Me, from within him shall flow rivers of living
   water." The springs of life are found in faith. Vital belief in the
   Lord Jesus brings the soul into communion with fountains of vitality.
   "All my springs are in Thee." And we cannot have springs without
   streams. Fountains make rivers. When the Divine life possesses the
   soul, it flows over in gracious ministries among our fellow-men. The
   affluence becomes an influence imparting itself to others. "From within
   shall flow rivers." And what shall be the character of the river?

   The life filled with the Spirit of God is a minister of vitality.
   Wherever the figure of the river is used in the Scriptures it always
   implies the carriage and the impartation of life. "The river of water
   of life." "Everything shall live whither the river cometh." Those who
   are in communion with the Holy Spirit are to be the antagonists of
   death, and are to convey the life-giving powers of the eternal God.
   First of all, they will vitalize dead organizations. There is nothing
   more burdensome than an organization bereft of life. There is nothing
   more inert than machinery divorced from energy. The Church is cumbered
   by dead and dormant institutions. Everywhere there is the incubus of
   institutionalism that has no inherent vitality. Now, the disciples of
   the Lord Jesus are to bring the needful life. Their influence is to be
   that of a river upon a mill-wheel. It changes the inactivity of death
   into beneficent motion, and things that were only impediments become
   ministers of progress.

   And the disciples of Christ are also to vitalize dead dispositions.
   Everywhere in human life there are withered and withering things which
   need to be quickened. In some lives hopes are drooping like spring
   blossoms that have been nipped by the frost. In other lives desires are
   fading, and are like plants that are suffering from thirst. And, again,
   in other lives the affections are ailing, and their strength is lapsing
   into perilous weakness. If we could only look into the secret places of
   the souls of men, we should be amazed in how many lives there is the
   touch of death. Now, the friends of the Lord Jesus are to move about
   among these drooping people like "rivers of water of life." The
   withered heart is to be thrilled by our presence. The drooping faculty
   is to lift itself up in new strength, by reason of the influence of our
   lives. We are to be the ministers of a mysterious but most real
   vitality. There is a significant passage in the Book of Job, which
   always seems to me to lend itself to rich and far-reaching
   interpretations. "For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that
   it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
   cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
   thereof die in the ground, yet through the scent of water it will bud
   and bring forth boughs like a plant." The old stock withering in the
   ground scents the presence of the water, and is quickened into newness
   of life. And so is it to be in the life of man. When the river of water
   of life comes near to souls that are drooping in disquietude and defeat
   they are to become alive again and clothe themselves in strength and
   beauty.

   But, in the second place, the life filled with the spirit of God is to
   be a minister of purity. It is "clear as crystal," and in all its
   movements it is the enemy of all defilement. I have watched a strong
   and impetuous stream, born after heavy rains, pouring its fulness into
   a stagnant pool which had become the home of corruption. In the energy
   of its presence the corruption was unloosed and carried away; until the
   pool was left clean and clear as a sea of glass. And such is to be the
   influence of the disciples of Christ upon the established corruption of
   our day. The glorious energies of a redeemed life are to be poured into
   the settled defilement, to stir up and release it, and to bear it
   entirely away. Imagine a half-dozen pure and strenuous moral rivers
   flowing strongly in every village in our land! Imagine ten thousand
   such rivers doing their purifying work in a great city! Think of such
   rivers moving in every human fellowship! I remember a town council
   which had come into the hands of men of common and questionable
   character, and the government of the town was becoming debased. And a
   number of men, in whom the Spirit dwelled mightily, and whose influence
   was like strong rivers, entered the council and made it clean. Who has
   not known a committee saved by the strength of one man's consecration?
   And this is suggestive of the possible influence of every life. If our
   souls, by faith in the Lord Christ, are in communion with the springs
   of life, then a river of pure and purifying influence will most
   assuredly flow in all our common intercourse.

   And, thirdly, the life filled with the Spirit of God is a minister of
   refreshment. There are desert places in the life when the springs seem
   far away. I got a letter the other day, in which my correspondent
   described what he called "a dry sorrow." The sorrow was so intense that
   he had lost the power to weep. It was grief that could not find relief
   in tears. It was "a dry and thirsty land where no water is." And
   everybody is familiar with such experiences, either in his own life or
   in the lives of others. Now, what is needed in such drought is some
   refreshing river. The prophet Isaiah declares that the ideal man is
   like "a river of water in a dry place." He brings refreshment to the
   soul that is held in perilous dryness. And who is to bring this
   refreshment? It can only be brought by men and women who live at the
   springs, and whose very presence is "a river of water of life."

   And, lastly, the life filled with the Holy Spirit is a minister of
   hilarity. What more fitting symbol of gladness can we find than a
   clear, bright stream, dancing and leaping in the sunshine? Just to look
   at it, just to listen to it, is to catch the contagion of its joyful
   movement. And "there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the
   city of God." The river that takes its rise in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus, that is born among the hills of grace, and. flows in the
   sunshine of the Eternal Love, is bound to be a minister of gladness and
   cheer. The desponding and the melancholy, and those whose faces are
   heavy with the gloom of fear, are to be heartened and cheered when the
   disciple of Christ draws near, for the life filled with the Spirit is
   like a dancing, joy-imparting, and beauty-creating stream. How near do
   we come to this ideal? Perhaps we can give cups of cold water. But is
   our life richer than this, and is it suggestive of music and dancing?
   Is there anything hilarious in its influence? Is there the touch of
   joy, the gladdening ministry of those whose wills are in harmony with
   the King?

   So, perhaps, instead of singing "Like a mighty army moves the Church of
   God," it might be a healthier expression if we sang, "Like a mighty
   river moves the Church of God"; a river carrying vitality, purity,
   refreshment, and making the birds to sing in the trees that line its
   banks.

OUTSIDE THE WALLS

   IT is a healthy experience to find rare flowers beyond the limits of
   one's own jealously-guarded garden. It is especially healthy when we
   have assumed that all the seed was in our own basket. It is altogether
   good to be made to wonder at these exotics growing so naturally in
   their alien bed. Our Lord seemed to take exquisite delight in pointing
   them out, and in emphasizing the teaching that His garden stretched
   beyond the confines of all the walls that had been built by men. He
   would stop His disciples on one of these alien roads--roads which to
   them had no significance except barrenness and desolation--and He would
   draw their reluctant eyes to some lovely flower growing by the way.
   Again and again He points them out, beautiful things outside the
   official circle, sweet presences beyond the limits of the recognized
   compound. He loved to reveal the flowers growing outside the walls.

   There were ten lepers, and all of them were healed by the Master, but
   only one returned to give thanks for his healing, "and he was a
   Samaritan." This fine flower of gratitude was found growing beyond the
   pale of exclusive and traditional privilege. It is like "a root out of
   a dry ground." But there it is. A fair and beautiful thing which
   refreshed the spirit of our Lord. And so it is to-day; this noble and
   graceful flower of gratitude may often be found growing in profusion
   outside the outermost walls of the Church. And so it is again that
   within the walls, amid rich conditions of soil and climate, you may
   sometimes seek for the flower in vain. There are lives which claim
   exalted heavenly relations, but they lack the grace of gratitude. There
   are many who cry, "God be merciful!" who never cry, "God be praised!"
   But the sweet song is often heard outside the walls, and the sweet
   singer has not built her nest near the recognized altars of the temple.

   "And the barbarians showed us no common kindness." That was a beautiful
   flower to be found growing in the wild home of caprice and
   superstition. Indeed, can we find anywhere a more beautiful flower than
   kindness? Is there any flower more pleasant to look upon, more sweet in
   its fragrance, more arresting and welcome to the eyes of men? And it
   was the barbarians who grew it in no common fashion. But where is the
   kindness born? From whose seed does it spring, and in what soil is it
   grown? With what sort of light and rain is it nourished? These
   questions lead us away to the source of every beautiful thing, even to
   the Great God, who has all "strength and beauty in His sanctuary." If
   the barbarians showed no common kindness, then the sweet flowers had
   been grown from seeds wafted from the paradise of God. When we call
   things by their right names, kindness is one of the fruits of the
   Spirit, and so these barbarians were just a part of the garden of the
   Lord.

   "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel." Here, again, is
   our Lord's delight in outside treasure. Here is a steady, steadfast,
   appropriating faith, liberating the divine and holy energies of
   healing, and yet the man in whom it dwells is not registered among "the
   favoured people of God." He is an outsider, an alien, remote from the
   privileged vantage-ground of sunshine and shower, and yet this strong,
   virile, oak-like faith is growing mightily in his soul. The Kingdom was
   wider than the visible Church. Some who were unregistered in the
   earthly lists of saints had "their names written in heaven." There were
   spiritual correspondences when there were no official wires. There was
   secret fellowship where there was no visible communion. And all this
   should be deeply heartening to our souls. The realm of the Spirit is
   bigger than we know. Our church rolls are not its measure. There are
   men and women of unconfessed relations who are at mighty grips with
   God. There is secret faith that has not yet found public confession.
   There are faithful souls who will never "follow with us," but who are
   busy "casting out devils in His name." They may keep their own way, but
   the Lord knows them, and He seals their faith with His grace and power.
   They are "outside the walls," but they are "in the Lord."

   "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold." And yet we are so
   tempted to think that all His sheep are in our fold, and we look with
   sharp suspicion on those that are outside our walls. I do not say that
   we bluntly deny them a part in the Tender Shepherd's care, but there is
   a reluctance of recognition, a want of generous candour, a disposition
   to withhold the right names from things, which is painful evidence that
   we severely limit the Shepherd's fold. Let us test ourselves by our
   regard for the Roman Catholics. How about the sheep of that fold? Do we
   heartily recognize the close communion between these sheep and our
   Shepherd? Do we readily acknowledge our common fellowship in the Lord?
   Or are we rather inclined to regard them as "black sheep,"
   shepherdless, or herded only by subtle and deceptive hirelings? "Them
   also I must bring." We urgently need this broader and deeper sense of
   communion. It is amazing how, with all our federations and alliances,
   the "fold" prejudices are so intense and vigorous. It may be that we
   take the "fold" spirit instead of the "flock" spirit into our
   alliances, and we preserve our bitter divisions in the midst of our
   apparent union. At any rate, there are deep denominational reluctances
   that would be burned out completely if we had more of the fire of the
   Holy Spirit, for concerning all such roots of bitterness "our God is a
   consuming fire."

   It is thus a wise and holy practice to look outside our walls. It is
   well to cultivate a wide expectancy, and to keep vigilant eyes upon
   every road, if perchance we may see signs of the coming of the Lord. If
   we find the red flower of love, let us relate it to God, for God is
   love.

XXXIII

HONEST MORAL JUDGMENT

   "BY their fruits ye shall know them." So that is to be the standard of
   judgment. We are not to be concerned with the label, but with the
   fruit. We are not to draw our conclusions from the florist's catalogue,
   but from the actual garden. Men are to be judged, not by their
   professions, but by their character, not by their theology, but by
   their life. That is a very simple and reasonable principle. We are to
   test things by their issues. We are to go into the orchard and taste
   the fruit.

   But the Master's teaching goes further than this. He insists that we
   are to be perfectly honest with our findings. If we find grapes We are
   to infer a vine, and not to suggest they are the product of a thorn. If
   we come upon figs we are to infer a fig tree, and not to suspect that
   they were borne on a thistle. We are not to belie our moral
   intelligence. We are not to cheat our instincts. We are not to confuse
   our common-sense. When I see fine moral grapes I must not hesitate in
   my conclusion that they are significant of so much nature and force of
   the moral vine. If I come upon spiritual grapes I must not insinuate
   that the serpent was the gardener, and that he himself has produced
   them. Wherever I see true goodness I must infer God. Wherever I find
   noble spiritual fruit I am to reason that it is a fruit of the Spirit.
   I must not confuse myself by saying "thorns" when it is as clear as the
   morning that I have found a cluster of grapes, and I must not say
   "thistles" when I have discovered ripe, delicious figs.

   Now there is a strange unwillingness to apply this principle. There is
   a hidden perversity in the mind and heart which turns us away from its
   simplicity. We are timid and hesitant and uncertain in our application.
   We see a grape, and we are half fearful it may have sprung from a
   thorn. We see a fig, and we are dubious whether it may not have sprung
   from a thistle. So we have confused our reason and abused our moral
   instincts. We have misinterpreted hopeful and helpful signs and
   presences. We have limited "the Holy One of Israel." We have seen noble
   deeds, and attributed them to an alien power. We have witnessed
   glorious ministries of emancipation, and we have said they were done by
   "Beelzebub, the Prince of devils."

   I must fearlessly apply the principle to my own life. I go into my
   heart and find a strange, wild country. There are many things that are
   withered, things that are distorted, and things that are ugly. There
   are thoughts and purposes sharp and cruel as thorns, and idle thistles
   abound on every hand. But suppose I find a few grapes, one tiny cluster
   of grapes? Then I must be honest with myself and rigidly true. I must
   not throw them to the thorns and thistles. I will say to myself: "These
   are true grapes, and they betoken the presence of the True Vine; the
   vine nature is here, the vine force, the Living Vine, the Christ." I
   find in my soul hints and suggestions of a better and larger life. My
   self-made earthclouds sometimes part asunder for a moment, and there
   breaks upon my gaze the glory of the heavenly country. I cannot quite
   say how they come. Sometimes they come in the quietness of the night.
   Sometimes they come in the convulsion of circumstances. I have known
   them come at the suggestion of a passing face. No matter how they come,
   what shall I do with them when they appear? Let me not call them flares
   from the pit, false beacons kindled by the Devil. Let me rather
   attribute them to the Father of Lights, the King of Glory.

   I find also in my soul some responsiveness to the "higher calling."
   Often when the gleam shines before me my heart goes out in earnest
   craving. Sometimes I have a hunger and a thirst for righteousness;
   desire is kindled, and I long to be clothed in the beauty on which I
   gaze. What then shall I call these things? Let me be just to myself,
   especially when I am tempted to think myself God-forsaken and
   God-ignored. Here is a holy desire; then I will call it a grape. I will
   not call it a thistledown. It is a fruit of the Vine, and the Lord is
   near. So will I reason concerning every gracious moment in my soul,
   just putting out tendrils toward the spiritual and the eternal. It may
   be only petty and poor, but if there be any achievement at all I will
   give it its right name. It may be that the grapes are not yet fully
   formed. They may be hard and green and sour. Still, they are imperfect
   grapes, and they are the fruit of the Vine, and for these I will thank
   and praise His grace.


   For every virtue we possess,

   And every conquest won,

   And every thought of holiness

   Are His and His alone.

   I must firmly apply the same principle to others. When I see grapes
   growing in their lives, I must not attribute them to thorns or
   thistles. I must be honest and firm in my reasoning. I never glorify
   God when I refer His works to the Devil. I must apply the reasoning to
   the people who are outside all Churches. I must not be tempted to label
   everything thorns and thistles, as though the Lord had no dominion and
   no ministry outside ecclesiastical fields. Here, again, perfect honesty
   and perfect candour will do the best service to the Lord. And I must
   follow the reasoning in my conclusions about the worshippers in
   Churches other than mine. How suspicious we are! How ready we are to
   call grapes thorns when they grow in another denominational field! Even
   when graces are evident, our consent is frequently so qualified, so
   ungracious, so reluctant! We reluctantly attribute them to
   "uncovenanted mercies." The seeds have been carried by stray winds, and
   the raindrops were intended for other fields!

   How grudging we often are in our recognition of the grapes that grow in
   the Episcopal Church, and still more of those that are found in the
   Roman Catholic Church! I know there has been much in our history to
   make us resentful, and to fill us with a hot contempt. But, however
   tempted we may be, we must not yield to the injustice of denying the
   real grapes, and labelling the whole field as the home of thorns and
   thistles. There are winsomely gracious things in their midst. There is
   saintly character, there is mystical insight, there are marvellous
   range and power, and tenderness of intercession. There is chivalrous
   and heroic consecration and service. The grapes are evident. Let us
   gladly attribute them to the blood of the vine.

   If I thus apply the Master's principle, honestly, consistently,
   universally, what will the result be?

   First of all, I shall have an enormously enlarged conception of the
   workings of the Lord. I shall realize that His spirit is present
   everywhere, knocking everywhere, and that "His train fills the temple."
   And, secondly, I shall have the energy of exhilarant hope. I shall know
   that I cannot begin and work anywhere where the Lord has not
   anticipated me and done preparatory work for my coming. "The fields are
   white already unto harvest." So life will become more reverent, as
   perception becomes more delicate, and it will thus be filled with the
   spirit of hopefulness and praise.

THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM

   I WANT to lead the meditations of my readers to a very familiar
   supplication in the Lord's Prayer: "Thy will be done." And with what
   better comment upon the words can I begin than this from John Calvin:
   "The substance of the prayer is that God would enlighten the world by
   the light of His Word, would form the hearts of men by the influence of
   His Spirit, and would restore to order, by the gracious exercise of His
   power, all the disorder that exists in the world." John Calvin thus
   brings us to a very definite conception as to what the prayer implies.
   The Kingdom comes just as God's thought and Spirit become dominant--His
   grace pervading human affection, His counsel illumining human judgment,
   His purpose fashioning human desire, His will controlling human
   movement. The Kingdom comes when His throne is revered, and when "the
   Lamb which is in the midst of the throne" constrains our wills in glad
   and spontaneous obedience. The Kingdom comes just as human
   relationships are shaped and beautified by the character of God, His
   righteousness expressed in our rectitude, His grace flowering in our
   graciousness, and His love finding a witness in everything lovely and
   of good report. The Kingdom comes when the King is honoured and when
   His statutes become our songs.

   We must offer the prayer as seers. Our souls must be possessed by the
   glorious vision of a world held in the majestic yet gracious
   sovereignty of God. The beautiful land must be ours in holy vision and
   dream. Even while we pray, the poet within us must be at work, that
   mystic architect and builder in the soul who completes his temples and
   palaces before the first material stone has been laid and before the
   first sod has been turned. It is characteristic of the poet that he
   abides in the vision of the finished city while yet there is only a
   shanty on the ground. He sees the shining minarets and towers while yet
   lot stands in the first rude clearing of the desert waste. He feels the
   quiet of the haven while he is in the midst of the stormy seas, and he
   hears the pipes of peace in the very clash and combat of war. The
   poet's soul dwells not so much in the temple when it is building as in
   the temple built. He is the seer, he carries the vision, and he reveals
   to us the goal of life and love and duty.

   Now, the manner of the poet has always been a manner of the true
   apostles and saints. They have borne in their souls the vision of the
   finished work. It was even so with the Master Himself. "I beheld Satan
   as the lightning fall from heaven." It was the vision of a triumph not
   yet fully accomplished. It was the manner of the Apostle Paul. He
   looked "not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
   not seen." He pressed "toward the mark for the prize of the high
   calling." It was also the manner of the Apostle John. "I, John, saw the
   holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God." And
   yet when he had the vision of the city how little of the city had been
   built! In place of a spiritual Kingdom he was confronted by mighty
   Rome, with her diseased pomp, and her festering luxuriousness, and her
   callous sensationalism, and her brutal pride. Instead of a sovereign
   Jesus he was face to face with a triumphant Nero! And yet he carried
   the vision of the finished work, and he saw "a new heaven and a new
   earth."

   And we also are to pray as seers, holding in our souls the vision of
   the perfected man, the perfected city, the perfected State. And I will
   give two reasons for this. First, there is always a peril of our
   forgetting the glory of the goal in the distractions of the immediate
   tasks. If we lose the vision, we spoil the task. If we lose the vision
   of the end, the means become enthroned as the end. "Coming to church"
   becomes the end instead of communion with God. And, secondly, we must
   pray as seers because of the vast inspiration which is born of the
   vision of finished achievement. We perhaps more readily see the
   operation of this principle in the contemplation of finished disaster.
   If a man keeps his eye steadily fixed on probable defeat he will
   squander his resources all along the road. To constantly anticipate
   defeat is to almost make certain of it. The anticipation of triumph is
   one of the secrets of victory. Now, this is a most important truth in
   Christian Science. Amid much which is erroneous and perilous and
   foolish it proclaims a vital truth. Christian Science counsels all its
   disciples to keep their minds fixed on finished achievement. If they
   want to possess or to recover health they must contemplate themselves
   in the possession of health. They must steadily foresee the condition
   at which they want to arrive. And the principle prevails in the highest
   sphere. When we pray for the coming of the Kingdom our souls must rest
   in the vision of a moral and spiritual glory of which that Kingdom
   consists. We must "see the holy city . . . coming down out of heaven
   from God." We must offer the prayer as seers.

   And, secondly, we must offer the prayer as labourers. Perhaps I want a
   stronger word than that; crusaders might serve the purpose better. The
   seer mist be a soldier. The vision must get into the mind as thought,
   it must get into the soul as desire, it must get into the body as the
   energy of surrendered limbs. We must have vision, but we must not be
   visionaries; we must be suppliants, but not cloistered and seclusive.
   We must labour to build the Kingdom for which we pray. This was
   characteristic of the Apostle John. He was a seer, but he was also a
   soldier. "I, John, your brother, and companion in tribulation, was in
   the isle which is called Patmos, for the word of God and for the
   testimony of Jesus Christ." This is surely worth noting. The bright
   vision came to the captive; the place of travail became the very door
   of hope. A more radiant apprehension of the heavenly city was the
   reward of fidelity to truth. John laboured in the building of the city
   for which he prayed. And may we not reverently say that this was also
   true of the Master? He carried the holy vision and He laboured for its
   fulfilment. "My father worketh hitherto, and I work." "I must work the
   works of Him that sent Me."

   And where shall we work for the building of the city? First, in our own
   calling. We must carry the vision there, and build a bit of the Kingdom
   in the sphere where we earn our daily bread. We must cherish the very
   highest ideal of our own vocation. We must set it in the light of the
   Kingdom. We must array it. in the colours of the Kingdom. We must
   depict it in the excellences of the Kingdom. And then we must set our
   idealized employment in its place, in the finished and perfected
   Kingdom of God. And then, in the second, place, we must hold ourselves
   sacredly responsible to the highest we have seen, and diligently, and
   if need be prayerfully, seek to incarnate it in a flesh-and-blood
   creation. We must hold fast to the ideal, and make it visible in work
   and in worker, in matter and in manner, and in every ministry of
   relation between ourselves and our fellow-men. Difficult? Of course it
   is difficult, but why are we men except to confront the difficult
   thing, and bend it in obeisance to a pure and sovereign will?

   And what we are to do with our own calling we are to do with our wider
   vocations as corporate members of the city and the State. No one can
   worthily say "Thy Kingdom come" and give no consecrated strength to the
   travail that makes the Kingdom come. In every city there are many
   crooked things needing to be made straight. There are many bitter pools
   needing to be made sweet. There are many galling yokes waiting to be
   shared. There are little children needing guidance, there are old
   people needing heartening, there are captives craving freedom. Is it
   nothing to you, all ye that do pray, "Thy Kingdom come"? We must come
   as seers to the need, and give our blood to remove it.

   And, lastly, we must offer the prayer as watchmen. We must watch for
   the coming of the Kingdom, and we must proclaim the breaking day. I
   think, perhaps, we say too much about the night and too little about
   the morning; too much about the fastnesses of darkness, or, at any
   rate, too little about the growing splendours of the day. I sometimes
   think we could do with a society whose one work should be to watch the
   dawn and record the signs of advancing day. Its glad and privileged
   duty would be to watch for signs of the Kingdom, and wherever they were
   visible to make them known. Its symbol would be the morning star, and
   its motto, "Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong!" It
   would be a society of scouts for observing and recording sunbeams, and
   the members would engirdle the earth in quest of good news. Daily
   papers would be diligently searched, not for news of strife, but for
   the great and winsome things which tell that the Lord is marching on.
   And it is marvellous what we may find in one day's newspaper if we
   scour it for signs of the Kingdom. And this must be the zealous quest
   of the suppliants of the Kingdom. We must let people know that the
   Kingdom is coming, and we must give them the proofs. "O thou that
   tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountains. O
   thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with
   strength, lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah,
   Behold your God."

THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

   WHEN the apostles received the power of the Holy Spirit what difference
   did it make to them? What kind of dynamic does the Holy Spirit bring to
   men? What change takes place in the lives of men to-day when they
   become companions of the Holy Spirit? What infirmities do they leave
   behind? What new equipment do they gain? I turn to the records of
   apostolic life and I put my inquiries there. What happened to these
   men? What kind of power did they receive when they had received the
   Holy Spirit?

   First of all, then, I find an extraordinary power of spiritual
   apprehension. I know not how to express what I see. The apostles have a
   certain powerful feeling for God. They have a keen spiritual sense
   which discerns the realities of the unseen. It is as though their souls
   have developed latent feelers for the Divine. If we compare their
   dulness in the earlier days before the Holy Spirit was received, with
   their alertness afterwards, we shall see that the difference is most
   marked. The Master Himself describes them as "slow of heart." Their
   perceptions are blunt. They are dull to catch the spiritual side of
   things. But now when we turn to the record in the Acts of the Apostles
   we find this powerful sense of the Divine presence. It is as though a
   man has been sitting in a room with another man, but was only dimly
   aware of his presence; and then there came to him a refinement of his
   senses, and he gained a perfect assurance and a vivid knowledge of the
   other's company. The spiritual senses of these men were awakened, and
   they became aware of the "all-aboutness" of God. They have an intimate
   power of correspondence with Him which makes the unseen Lord a most
   real and intimate friend. And along with this sense of the Divine
   presence there is a refined apprehension of the Divine will. Everywhere
   in the apostolic life there is a tender and refined correspondence with
   the mind of God. Everywhere communications are being made between the
   Divine and human, and the human is strongly apprehending the Divine.
   Sentences like these abound everywhere: "The angel of the Lord said
   unto me"; "The Spirit said to Philip, Go near"; "And the Lord said to
   Ananias"; "The Spirit said unto Peter." There is everywhere this
   suggestion of an intimate walk and an intimate knowledge of God's will.
   Is not this a power to be coveted, and a power to be desired? And it is
   a power given by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

   I look again at the lives of these apostles, and I find them
   distinguished by magnificent force of character. In the early days they
   were timid, pliable, unfaithful. In supreme crises they deserted their
   Master and fled. They were as reeds shaken by the wind. The wind that
   blew upon them from the haunts of desolation, the keen, perilous winds
   of persecution, made these disciples bend before their blast. The men
   were negative, hesitant, uncertain, altogether lacking in persistent
   force. But now the timid and fearful have become positive and
   affirmative. There is nothing lax about them, nothing wavering, nothing
   yielding. Their characters have become strong, and steady, and
   effective. I say they have got force of character, and they have the
   two elements that are always found in forceful character: they have
   light and they have heat. They have light in the sense of clarity of
   purpose. Their outlook is not confused. Their aim is perfectly clear.
   If we watch them in the service of their Lord we find them never to be
   diverted from their track. "This one thing I do." They have this
   primary element in a forceful character, the clarity of an undivided
   aim. And the second element in a forceful character is heat, the fire
   of a quenchless enthusiasm. And they certainly had this fire in
   glorious strength and abundance. The Acts of the Apostles is a burning
   book. There is no cold or lukewarm patch from end to end. The disciples
   had been baptized with fire, with the holy, glowing enthusiasm caught
   from the altar of God. They had this central fire, from which every
   other purpose and faculty in the life gets its strength. This fire in
   the apostles' soul was like a furnace-fire in a great liner, which
   drives her through the tempests and through the envious and engulfing
   deep. Nothing could stop these men! Nothing could hinder their going!
   "We cannot but speak the things that we have seen and heard." "We must
   obey God rather than man." This strong imperative rings throughout all
   their doings and all their speech. They have heat, and they have light,
   because they were baptized by the power of the Holy Ghost.

   And I look again into the lives of these men who had been redeemed by
   the power of the Holy Ghost, and I find the energies of a glorious
   optimism. There is no more buoyant and exhilarating book in the
   literature than the book of The Acts. If we sit down and read it at a
   sitting we shall feel something of the swift and hopeful pace of its
   movement. I do not know that in their earlier days we should have
   described the disciples as "children of light." They easily lost heart,
   and the cloudy days filled them with dismay. But now, after they have
   received the Holy Spirit, we find them facing a hostile world. They are
   face to face with obstructions, with persecutions, with threats of
   imprisonment and death. But nowhere do we find a desponding or a
   despairing note. Ever and everywhere they are optimists in spirit. And
   what is an optimist? He is a man who can scent the coming harvest when
   the snow is on the ground. He can "feel the days before him." He can
   live in the distant June in the dingy days of December. That is an
   optimist, a man who can believe in the best in the arrogant and
   aggressive presence of the worst. He can be imprisoned in the
   desolations of Patmos and yet can see "the Holy City, the New Jerusalem
   coming down out of heaven from God." He can look at a poor, wayward,
   sinful Samaritan woman whose life is scorched like a blasted heath, and
   He can say, "The fields are ripe already unto harvest." And this power
   of optimism is always operative in the apostolic life. I find it in the
   springiness of their soul. You cannot break their spirit. You cannot
   hold them down in dull despair. "They laid their hands on apostles and
   put them in the common prison." And what happened after that? The
   morning after their release I read, "They entered into the temple early
   in the morning and taught." And here is another part of the record:
   "When they had called the apostles, and had beaten them, they commanded
   that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. And
   they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
   were counted worthy to suffer for His sake." These men could not be
   held down. The spirit of optimism was ever dominant.

   And with their springiness there was a marvellous spirit of joy. Theirs
   was not a dull buoyancy, but a radiant and a singing one. "And they
   raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of
   their coasts; and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy
   Ghost"! "And at midnight Paul and Silas sang praises unto God"! Is not
   this the very spirit of power? These men had spiritual springiness,
   spiritual delight, because they had the spirit of Christian optimism,
   and this power they received when the Holy Ghost came upon them.

   Do we wonder, then, that men of this kind, so endowed, have the
   additional power of witnessing for the Lord Jesus Christ? They witness
   by the arresting magnetism of their own transfigured character. They
   witness by their clear and enlightened apprehension of the Gospel by
   which they have been redeemed. And they witness by the grip of their
   words; words which were vitalized by the indwelling spirit of God. And
   we, too, shall receive a similar power when the Holy Spirit comes upon
   us. The same power is offered to us, to fit us for our condition, to
   equip us for our life. And what are the terms on which that power is
   received? They are these: that we are willing to offer our life for
   God, that the offer be made in all sincerity, made in simplicity, made
   in humble trust upon the Lord Jesus Christ. It means that we are
   willing to give up our sins, to lay down our pride. It means that we
   are willing to receive the Lord as our guest, and to allow Him to rule
   and to dominate our lives.

XXXVI

KEEPING THE ROADS OPEN!

   "IF thy brother sin." But we must be quite sure about it. We can so
   easily be mistaken. Summary judgment can be villainously unjust. The
   assumed criminal may be altogether innocent, and his supposed crime may
   be the ugly figment of our own diseased imagination. For through what
   perverting media we can look at one another, and what monsters we
   appear when seen through a distorting lens! And therefore the primary
   rule of guidance in all presumed offences is that a man should examine
   his lens. Is the lens a perverting medium? Am I looking through a
   magnifying glass, and therefore magnifying trifles? Is the whole matter
   an exaggeration? And is the real fault in my own eye? Let me not leap
   to conclusions concerning my brother. "Let every man be swift to hear,
   slow to speak, slow to wrath."

   But assuming that there is no distorting lens corrupting our judgment,
   and that the offence is palpable when seen through cool and simple
   sight, what then should be our course? "Rebuke him." Well, that would
   be pleasant enough. It is an exercise which provides a feast for the
   majority of people, and we set about it with rare satisfaction. But
   there are rebukes and rebukes. There is a rebuke which is only intended
   to satisfy the offended, and there is a rebuke which is purposed to
   rectify the offender. A legitimate rebuke is more than a vent for
   passion--it is a minister of redemption. It is intended to do more than
   work off my spleen; it is purposed to remove my brother's defilement.
   It is to be used not so much for the relief of my wound, but for the
   healing of his. The wound of the offended is clean, and time will most
   surely heal it. But the wound of the offender is unclean, and it may
   easily fester into something worse. And therefore I say the primary
   purpose of a rebuke is not to gratify my temper, but to help my brother
   to recover his broken health.

   Now, we may quite easily ascertain whether our rebuke has been of the
   kind counselled by the Master, a medicated kind, and the test is to be
   found in whether we are prepared to go further with our Lord. "If he
   repent, forgive him." If our rebuke has been healthy and wholesome, we
   shall be quite ready to take the further step as soon as occasion
   offers. The fine aim and trend of all Christian rebuke is ultimate
   reconciliation. A rebuke is not an instrument of punishment; it is an
   instrument of adjustment. It is not penal, but surgical, and always and
   everywhere it is purposed to be a minister of moral and spiritual
   restoration. To put the matter in a word, in all the offences we
   suffer, our after-conduct should seek the moral recovery of the
   offender.

   Now, let us seek to grasp one or two vital principles which lie behind
   this teaching. And I think we must begin here: a man's finest asset is
   his integrity. It is just as well that even so familiar a commonplace
   as this should be re-emphasized. We are in such general agreement about
   it that it is apt to be ignored. Let a man destroy his integrity, and
   he destroys the finest jewel in his life. "A man's life consisteth not
   in the abundance of things which he possesseth." Things provide only an
   existence; in character is found the life.

   And the second step is this: the finest contribution which any man can
   make to a city or a nation is the contribution of an unblemished
   character, the gift of a scrupulously clean and consistent life. It is
   ever a temptation to men to esteem gifts more than dispositions, to
   exalt the showy and the dazzling more than the inherently good. We are
   captured and fascinated by genius, and talent, and cleverness, and
   subtle and ingenious accomplishments. And yet these do not constitute
   the sterling wealth of the corporate life. When a man has given only
   brilliant genius to his country he has not given his best. The best we
   can give is not our interest, not our service, but a chivalrous
   character, massive and undefiled.

   If, therefore, a man has lapsed from moral and spiritual health, and is
   squandering his finest treasure, it should surely be his brother's
   concern, for his own sake as well as for the sake of the offender, to
   keep the way open for his return. It is wise, even for our own sakes,
   to seek an offender's restoration. When a man becomes morally defiled
   he introduces uncleanness into the commonwealth. Our sense of the
   corporate life is so dull and faint that we only very imperfectly
   discern the influence of the part upon the whole. Our conception of
   society is mechanical, not organic; it is political, not vital. We
   think of society as a chance collection, not as a nerve-pervaded
   corporation. At the best we regard it only as an aggregation and not a
   union. But the teaching of the Scriptures brings before us a far more
   profound conception. According to the New Testament, society is not a
   mere combination, like a heap of miscellaneous articles which the ocean
   has thrown up on the shore. The race of men constitute one vast, nervy
   body, with all the members vitally interdependent, vitally
   intercommunicative, inherently one and whole, every part related to
   every other part in community of interest, and every part suffering in
   so far as any part is undeveloped or bruised or broken. Let me state
   quite boldly the implications of this teaching. So long as China's
   hordes are stagnant we ourselves will remain immature! So long as the
   cannibal tribes of tropical islands drowse on in their animalism we
   ourselves will not be fully awake! So long as anywhere in broad England
   any man is mentally or morally dwarfed, every other man will be
   hindered from gaining his appointed stature! No man will walk at his
   full height so long as any man remains a pigmy! One moral cripple
   affects the pace of the race! And therefore if a man "goes wrong," if
   he becomes morally filthy, whether in slum or suburb, there is no
   isolation-hospital in which his nefarious influence can be safely
   confined. Prison-walls may isolate bodies, they cannot destroy the
   nerve communications of the race. We are every man and woman the poorer
   for every man and woman in gaol to-day.

   If, therefore, my brother sin, what shall I do? Why, for the sake of
   everybody, try to get him right again. To rebuke him is not enough; to
   punish him unduly may aggravate the danger. The only adequate purpose
   is to get him whole again. And therefore did I say it is for the
   offended to keep the road open for the offender's return.

   Now, according to the teachings of the Master, one of the methods for
   keeping open roads in the moral and spiritual realm is the ministry of
   forgiveness. "Forgive him." Yes, but the word is not used with the thin
   significance of effeminate emotion. The forgiveness of the New
   Testament is not emotional, but motional; not pathetic, but energetic;
   not a matter of cheap tears, but of sacrificial service. It is more
   than pardon, it is chivalry. It is more than the withdrawal, of the
   sword, it is the conversion of the sword into a ploughshare. It is the
   destructive transformed into the constructive and employed in positive
   culture. It is no use-considering anything else than this when we are
   thinking or speaking about forgiveness. There are many counterfeits
   about; masquerading as forgiveness, but they have no vital kinship with
   reality. There is a superciliousness which patronizingly utters sacred
   words, but its poverty is exposed by its very pride. Forgiveness is not
   a passive acquittal; it expresses itself in the ministry of
   self-sacrificing toil. And such a spirit, by the teaching of the
   Master, will assuredly keep the road open for a sinful brother's
   return, and we shall be called "the repairers of the breach, the
   restorers of paths to dwell in."

   But a disposition of this kind demands that .we ourselves have faith in
   the spiritualities. Practical materialists will have no concern for
   these things, because the currents and forces in which they believe are
   of an altogether mundane kind. It is needful to have a firm conviction
   of the reality of the spiritualities, and of their power to strengthen
   or corrode the temporalities which are often so glaringly showy and so
   superficially majestic. If we are to exercise the ministry of
   forgiveness, in the way in which I have indicated, it is needful that
   we believe in God, and in the energies of godliness, and in our own
   possible co-operation in the ministries of redemption. And, therefore,
   how fitting was the prayer of the apostles which succeeded this high
   counsel of our Lord, "Increase our faith"!

A FRIEND OF THE SUSPECTED

   SUCH was the character of the Apostle Barnabas. From his life there
   emanated the strength and perfume of goodness, and he ministered among
   his brethren as the son of consolation. Whenever people were under a
   cloud he brought the light of cheer. Whenever they moved in timidity,
   by reason of suspicion, he brought the atmosphere of confidence. I want
   to look at his character and inspect the springs of his disposition and
   service.

   How was his life related to God? First of all we are told he was "full
   of faith." The word "full" is strangely significant. There are
   analogies which may help us in our apprehension of this side of his
   character. We speak sometimes of a singer as being "full of music." I
   spent an hour a little time ago in the presence of a distinguished
   singer. Every moment she seemed to be bubbling over with song. Every
   interest in her life was controlled by the dominant passion. Every
   power in her being seemed to sway to one inspiration like fern and
   reeds responding to the common movement of the wind. An organist's
   fingers are raining music even when he is not at the organ. They are
   moving to inaudible sounds. The soul that is full of music brings its
   music into everything, and every circumstance becomes the home of song.
   And so it is with the life that is "full of faith." Let me give another
   analogy. When the conductor of an orchestra raises his baton the eyes
   of every instrumentalist are fixed upon him. It would be right to say
   that the orchestra is "full of obedience." Every member in the
   fellowship is controlled by one will, and all the powers co-operate in
   this common subjection. The life that is "full of faith" is a life in
   which every power of the soul pays homage to the will of the Lord.
   Every faculty is open in trustful dependence on the Unseen, and this
   obeisance is paid in all the varying circumstances of the ever-changing
   road. Barnabas was "full of faith."

   And the second characteristic of his supreme relationships was this: he
   was "full of the Holy Spirit." This fulness is a sequent to the other.
   Faith is the willingness of the soul to receive the Holy Spirit. Faith
   implies that the soul is disposed to Divine hospitality. It is willing
   to entertain the Lord. It is ready to open the door to heavenly
   presences, and to throw the windows open to heavenly airs. I suppose
   that some of the most nauseous places on the face of the earth are on
   the high seas. Where the air is purest and cleanest uncleanness may
   most abound. There can be nothing more repulsive than the air of many a
   sailor's cabin, and this in spite of the fact that his boat is
   enveloped in the purest air that enswathes the earth. We can breathe a
   stenchful atmosphere when immeasurable leagues of finest air are
   pressing round on every side. Now, to open the port-hole is to have
   fellowship with the infinite. The little cabin becomes filled with air
   that has been washed and sweetened by the influences of immeasurable
   space. And so it is that faith opens the life to breathings of the
   Infinite Spirit. Faith makes the soul competent to receive the Holy
   Spirit. Barnabas was open to the Divine, and the Divine became his
   guest.

   Now turn to his human relationships. What should we expect such a man
   to be in his active life in the world? I should venture to characterize
   the life of this early apostle in one phrase. He was the friend of the
   suspected. First of all he was the friend of suspected individuals.
   Saul heard the call of his Lord, and responded, and became a disciple
   of the Son of God. Now, there is always a strange reluctance to believe
   in the goodness of people who have been reclaimed. We suspect that
   their apparent improvement may be only a fresh disguise of their vice.
   Their tears may be only part of their trickery. We say to ourselves and
   to one another, "We have known him of old." Or we say, "What is he up
   to now?" His conversion is regarded as a new make-up by an old actor.
   In some such way was the Apostle Paul regarded at his conversion. He
   was the object of deep suspicion. He was suspected of being a Jesuit
   before even Jesuitry was born. He might be seeking deeper intimacies in
   order that he might carry out malicious designs. "They were afraid, and
   did not believe that he was a disciple." What then can be done for a
   man who is treated with such chilling vigilance? "Barnabas took him and
   brought him to the apostles." It was a very delicate companionship
   which Barnabas thus offered to the timid convert to help him along the
   early steps of the way. I try to imagine the two as they made their way
   to the apostles' company. I try to imagine the character of their
   intercourse. I can feel how they would grow into each other, and how
   heart and mind would commune with heart and mind in a fellowship never
   to be broken. And this is the kind of strengthening communion which
   thousands of converts need in our own day, especially those who are
   leaving behind them the record of glaring and notorious lives. They
   need the friendship of men who shield them from suspicion, and who by
   their confidence nourish their frailty into hopeful strength.

   Let me give another instance of this man's disposition and service. We
   lose sight of the convert Saul. He became a recluse. He retires into
   comparative privacy and solitude. He seems to be lost to the Church,
   and no one appears concerned about his whereabouts. For some years he
   vanishes from our sight. And then Barnabas came to Antioch to execute a
   commission with which he had been entrusted by the Church in Jerusalem.
   And when his task was done he "departed to Tarsus to seek Saul." I like
   to think of that man setting out on his journey in quest of the other
   man destined to be the great apostle to the Gentiles. It seems as
   though the Apostle Paul was twice saved by Barnabas to the services of
   the Christian Church. He brought him to Antioch, and the great
   missionary crusade began. How much we are indebted to the folk who seek
   out the hidden people, the folk who fetch us out of our holes! There
   are thousands of people hiding away in forgotten corners, and Barnabas
   is needed to bring them to their places of ministry and service.

   There is one other instance where Barnabas overwhelmed the suspicions
   of others and redeemed the defeated man from alienation. John Mark had
   become fearful. He was perhaps afraid of the fever that haunted the
   swamps along the Asiatic coast. Or perhaps it was the looming of other
   kinds of danger and difficulty. Whatever it was it was something that
   frowned upon them, and Mark left the apostolic company and turned back.
   He at once became a child of suspicion. And at a later day, when a new
   enterprise was being commenced, "Paul thought not good to take him."
   But again Barnabas interposed and "took Mark." How much we are indebted
   to the gracious folk who are willing to give us a second chance! What a
   radiant record shines behind the names of those who have permitted the
   fallen to try again! It is the way of the Lord.

   When Jonah had rejected his first command, and had turned his back upon
   it, and wandered in the ways of trespass and transgression, the Lord
   gave him a second chance. "And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a
   second time." This is the disposition that needs to be manifested by
   the followers of the Christ. There are multitudes of people who have
   broken their covenant, who have deserted to the foe, who have eaten the
   bread of the enemy, but who are longing to return to the old camp.
   Barnabas was the friend of just such longing souls. He was the helper
   of those who had failed. He was the advocate of the second chance.

   But he was not only the friend of suspected individuals. He was the
   guardian of suspected causes. There were strange doings at Antioch,
   which were reported to Jerusalem as the extension of the Kingdom of
   God. Great doubts arose as to its being genuine, and many looked upon
   it with severe suspicion. Barnabas was sent as a deputation of inquiry.
   And what is the record of the mission? "When he had seen the grace of
   God," Barnabas had the requisite light. His eyes were anointed with eye
   salve and his perceptions were clean and clear. He knew the old fruit,
   even when he found it growing in a new garden. He recognized the old
   tokens of grace, even when they were revealed in strange conditions.
   "When he had seen it he was glad." And these, too, are the folk we want
   in our own time. We need people who can see Christ when He appears in a
   new dress, who can discern the cause of the Kingdom when it shows
   itself in novel conditions. We need the spirit of candour and of
   consecrated expectancy, and for these we require the fulness of faith
   and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. There is great work for
   Barnabas nowadays, for everywhere God is revealing Himself in new and
   diverse manners, and watchful, faithful men will love His appearing.

  XXXVIII

  THE HIGHER MINISTRIES OF HOLIDAYS

   WHY did our Lord go "every night" into the mountain? And why was it His
   custom to walk so frequently in the garden? It was because He felt the
   boon companionship of Nature, the friendly helpfulness of the vast and
   the beautiful. Mountain and garden were allies of the spirit, silent
   Greathearts who ministered to Him in the pilgrim way. He sought the
   mountain when He was pondering over great decisions. He was found in a
   garden "in the night in which He was betrayed." He heard wondrous
   messages in her voices; in her silences, too. He listened to mysterious
   speech. He read the evangel of the lilies. He understood the language
   of the birds. He read the face of the sky. He shared the secrets of the
   soil and the seed. He walked through the cornfields on the Sabbath day,
   and the ears of corn ministered to a richer Sabbatic peace. He stooped
   to hold intercourse with the grass of the field. The wind brought Him
   tidings of other worlds. The vineyards gave Him more than grapes and
   wine; they refreshed and strengthened His soul. Everywhere and always
   our Saviour was in communion with His willing and immediate friends in
   the natural world. Nature was to Jesus a blessed colleague in the
   soul's commerce and fellowship with the Highest.

   And we, too, seek rest and recreation by the seashore or countryside.
   Our bodies become like lamps that are in need of oil; they burn a
   little dim and uncertain; and sometimes because we are a little spent
   and weary we become very unpleasant to other people, like lamps that
   have begun to smoke. We are consuming wick rather than oil, and it is
   attended with offensive consequences all round. And so we must get our
   lamps refilled, and we find the precious oil in the green pastures or
   by the deep-sounding sea.

   Now, it is good for us to remember that a jaded body can be greatly
   helped through the ministry of a refreshed mind. A noble thought in the
   mind has ennerving communion with the entire circle of our life. And
   the principle is even still more deep and certain in its influences
   when for a noble thought we substitute an exuberant soul. "Thy faith
   hath saved thee," said the Master, and the extraordinary physical
   convalescence was directly related to a mood and disposition of the
   soul. And, therefore, although we may get valuable stock of oil for our
   spent and sputtering lamp by just lying down on the slopes of the
   hills, or throwing ourselves on the sands, yet the filling would be
   greatly helped if to a prudent physical indolence we added refined and
   noble thought. Golfing will be all the more effective as a tonic if a
   man is open to the Divine. We cannot get the best out of Nature if we
   are closed against her deepest secret. We may depend upon it that when
   Jesus prayed upon the mountain He got the very best that the mountain
   had to give. When He knelt in the garden of Gethsemane the olive groves
   contributed far more than restful shade and perfume. Our bodies draw
   upon Nature's finest essence when our spirits are in communion with
   Nature's God. And so in all our thinkings about rejuvenation let us
   include the interests of the spirit. The most refreshing holiday is
   that which is pervaded by an abiding communion with God. Our spiritual
   habits are the ministers or the masters of our bodies, and we do a very
   ill turn to our tired bodies if, by the manner of our holiday, we choke
   the channels of the highest life.

   I know that Nature has frequently an unconscious and a very blessed
   influence upon our minds and souls. A revelation of vastitude may have
   a most expansive influence upon us, even if the Divine do not
   consciously possess our thoughts. The bounding wave may give us a very
   exhilarating influence, and so may the jocund daffodils, or the bright
   loneliness of the uplifted hills. Nature may soothe us, or she may
   excite us; she may be a stimulant or a sedative. But this unconscious
   influence is by no means sure. If the presence of broad spaces and
   towering heights were always ministers of expansion how do we explain
   those multitudes in our rural population whose minds are small, and
   dull, and unresponsive, and who have no conscious or unconscious
   communion with the subtle beauty or the far-stretching glory of their
   surroundings?

   But why go to a farm labourer for our example? We may find the witness
   in our own experience. We have often been to the royal seats of
   Nature's majesty or beauty, we have climbed her awful mountains, we
   have walked her broad domains, we have sailed her immeasurable seas,
   and in very truth we have returned home as small as we went away. The
   body has gained something, but not the mind or the soul, and, because
   the mind and the soul have been locked up like the rooms we have left
   behind in the city, our very bodies have not recovered that exuberant
   strength which was intended for them in the gracious purpose of God.

   In all our holiday-making let us deliberately commune with the Divine.
   I am painfully aware that the very form of the phrase I have used is
   suggestive of a task, and appears to be uncongenial to the holiday
   mood. But there can be nothing in all our plans more holiday-like and
   more holiday-giving than just this simple purpose to commune with God.
   Does it stint our holiday feeling to recall the face and the tenderness
   of our little child? When we are in some almost awful splendour, is the
   thought of love an intrusion which darkens the privilege into task?
   Surely the thought of the beloved deepens and chastens the joy! And so
   is it in the highest realms and reaches of thought; the right thought
   of God deepens and enriches the holiday mood and puts us into communion
   with the very springs of life and joy and peace. We are going back to
   the old place, on the hill, on the moor, or by the sea. Have we ever
   met the Lord there? Have we ever seen the mystic cloud upon the hills?
   Have we ever seen Him come walking on the waters? Have we ever felt His
   Presence in the cornfields? Has He ever talked with us as we stooped to
   pick a flower by the way? Never met Him? Ah! then, we don't yet know
   our holiday place as we may know it, and as, please God! we may know it
   before we come back home again. We have only seen it in the light of
   common day. Wait until we have seen it in His blessed fellowship and we
   shall be amazed at the glory! We have seen the common bush and we think
   it wonderful; wait until we have seen the bush burn with the radiant
   Presence of God. Wait until we have been up the hill with the Lord, and
   in. the far-reaching glory He has become transfigured before us. The
   sense of His Presence never spoils our freedom or chills our pleasure;
   it adds sunshine to light and delightful music to all our songs. When
   He walks with us as we journey to Emmaus He opens up everything.

   What, then, shall we do on our holiday? First of all, let us quietly
   cultivate the sense of the Presence of our Lord. Let there be no stress
   about it and no strain; the quieter it is, the more natural and
   familiar, the better it will be. All that we need to do is just to call
   Him to mind and to link Him with the beauty of the glory we
   contemplate. Call Him into your mind as freely and as naturally as you
   would recall the thought of a loved one whom you have temporarily
   forgotten. You are climbing the slope of some glorious hill, or you
   stand upon its shoulder or its summit; quietly call to your mind: "The
   strength of the hills is His also." "Who by His strength setteth fast
   the mountains, being girded with power." "Faith has still its Olivet
   and love its Galilee." Or you are walking by the shores of the incoming
   sea: "The sea is His and He made it." "There's a wideness in God's
   mercy like the wideness of the sea." Or you are gazing upon the wonders
   of sunrise and sunset, upon their gorgeous harmony of colours, upon the
   mighty architecture of embattled clouds: "He clothed Himself in light
   as with a garment." "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the
   firmament sheweth His handiwork." "The Sun of Righteousness shall arise
   with healing on His wings." Or you are swept by the fresh,
   health-giving wind, from the deep, or on the heights: "He rideth upon
   the wings of the wind."


   Thy bountiful care,

   What tongue can relate,

   It breathes in the air.

   "And He breathed upon them and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Or you
   are amid the perfumed loveliness of the flowers of the field:


   &gt;Thy sweetness hath betrayed Thee, Lord;

   Dear Spirit, it is Thou!

   Would this gentle recollection interfere with the holiday? Would it
   impoverish it? Would it chill it? Or would it not rather warm and
   enlarge it, making every avenue bright and luminous, changing
   commandments into beatitudes:


   And our lives would be all sunshine

   In the sweetness of our Lord.

   "Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God," and His statutes shall become
   thy songs.

   And then I would give a second counsel. Let us seek the mystic mind of
   God in the creations of the natural world. For these material presences
   are speaking to us. They are the wonderful shrines in which are to be
   found still more wonderful messages. Do not let us confine our wonder
   to the shrine and ignore the message. Let us hold ourselves receptive
   to the secret, spiritual thing. Our Saviour elicited the secret of the
   lilies. He read an evangel as He saw the birds on the wing or in their
   nests. Everything was to Him a kind of envelope, and He reverently
   opened it and found the mystic scroll. And so was it with the psalmists
   and the prophets. Material things were the bearers of spiritual things,
   and these old seers continually gather the secret treasure. Charles
   Kingsley said that whenever he went down a country lane he felt as
   though everything about him, every leaf, and bud, and flower, were
   saying something to him, and he was pained by the feeling of his
   density. But he heard many, many things, and he has told them again to
   us. And in our own degree we all may do it. At any rate, we can
   question these sublime and beautiful things, and rightly to ask a
   question is to put oneself in the mood for receiving a reply. Why not
   begin with a flower? "What message hast thou here for me, thou tender,
   beautiful, gracious thing? What tidings dost thou bring?" Maybe not all
   at once will our spirit discover the answer, but it will not be long
   before we are sensitive enough to catch some whisper from our God.
   Material presences, continually wooed by the spirit, will yield their
   spiritual treasure, and the jubilant heart will store up its growing
   wealth of grace. And so, I say, cannot we quietly interrogate our
   surroundings, without fuss or obtrusion, and by wise questioning
   prepare ourselves for great replies? "What hast thou to say to me, O
   breaking wave, the lifted hill, flying cloud, gentle breeze, or roaring
   blast?" And if some day our holiday plans are broken by the broken
   weather it will be a blessed thing to consult the falling rain, and ask
   what secret messages it may have for men, and what news it brings of
   things Divine! These are simplicities, but they will lead us into
   profundities, and without any weight or burdensomeness they will keep
   our souls "alive unto God."


   What sweetness on Thine earth doth dwell!

   How precious, Lord, these gifts of Thine!

   Yet sweeter messages they tell,

   These earnests of delight Divine.


   These odours blest, these gracious flowers,

   These sweet sounds that around us rise,

   Give tidings of the heavenly bowers,

   Prelude the angelic harmonies.

   And thus let us imitate the Scriptures in regarding the ministries of
   Nature as illustrative of the ministries of grace. While we look at the
   seen, let us also look at the unseen. Let the symbol become a veil
   through which we can see Him "who is invisible." Let us use our happy
   surroundings as modes of expression between God and the soul, and the
   soul and God.

   Such communings do not detract from the worth and wealth of a holiday,
   they rather enrich and augment it. They give freedom and height and
   expansion to the soul; and high spirits are good spirits, and good
   spirits are the very first essential to bodily health and exuberance.
   To "sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus" makes one akin to the
   secret power which dwells in the blowing corn and the rolling wave.

   We do not need to have vast panoramas, or gigantic mountains, or
   immeasurable seas, before we can enter into sacred communion with the
   spirit of Nature. We can begin at home in more limited surroundings. We
   have always with us the pageant of the clouds. We have the wonder of
   the sky. "The noblest scenes of the earth can be seen and known but by
   few; it is not intended that man should live always in the midst of
   them; he injures them by his presence, he ceases to feel them if he is
   always with them; but the sky is for all . . . fitted in all its
   functions for the perpetual comfort and exulting of the heart,--for
   soothing it, and purifying it from its dross and dust." We have always,
   not far away, the treasures of the gardens and the flowers of the
   fields. We have the birds, and our Lord found a great evangel in the
   sparrows! Yes, it is altogether true what Stevenson said: "The spirit
   of delight comes often on small wings." Let us watch the commonplaces
   in Nature. We shall find them vistas opening into the infinite and
   eternal. "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world
   and they that dwell therein." "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord. The
   fulness of the whole earth is His glory."
