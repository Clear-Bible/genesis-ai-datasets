   Deuteronomy 24

   Deuteronomy 24:8, 9

   8. Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently,
   and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you:
   as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.

   8. Observa in plaga leprae, ad observandum diligenter et faciendum
   secundum omnia quae docuerint vos sacerdotes Levitae: sicuti praecepi
   eis, ita observabitis ad faciendum.

   9. Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after
   that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

   9. Recordare quid fecerit Jehova Deus tuus Mariae in itinere, quum
   egressi estis ex Aegypto.


   8. Take heed in the plague of leprosy. I am aware how greatly
   interpreters differ from each other and how variously they twist
   whatever Moses has written about Leprosy. Some are too eagerly devoted
   to allegories; some think that God, as a prudent Legislator, merely
   gave a commandment of a sanitary, nature, in order that a contagious
   disease should not, spread among the people. This notion, however, is
   very. poor, and almost unmeaning; and is briefly. refuted by Moses
   himself, both where he recounts the history of Miriam's leprosy, and
   also where he assigns the cause why lepers should be put out of the
   camp, viz that they might not defile the camp in which God dwelt,
   whilst he ranks them with those that have an issue, and that they are
   defiled by the dead. Wherefore, I have thought it well, previous to
   attempting the full elucidation of the matter, to adduce two passages,
   by way of preface, from whence the design of God may more fully appear.
   When, in this passage from Deuteronomy, He commands the people to "take
   heed" and "observe diligently" the plague of leprosy, there can be no
   question but that He thus ratifies what He had before set forth at
   greater length in Leviticus. And, first of all, He refers the judgment
   of the matter to the priests, that what they pronounce should be firm
   and unalterable; and secondly, He would have the priests, lest they
   should pronounce rashly, and according to their own wishes, to follow
   simply what He prescribed to them, so that they may only be the
   ministers, or heralds; whilst, as to the sovereign authority, He alone
   should be the Judge. He confirms the law which He imposes by a special
   example; because He had cast out Miriam, the sister of Moses, for a
   time, lest her uncleanness during her leprosy should defile the camp.
   For the view which some take, that He exhorts the people lest, through
   sin, they should bring upon themselves the same evil as Miriam, is not
   to the purpose. But that which I have stated makes excellent sense,
   viz., that God's command, whereby He prohibited Miriam from entering
   the camp, was to have the force and weight of a perpetual law; because
   He thus ordained what He would always have done.

   Numbers 5

   Numbers 5:1-3

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every
   leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by
   the dead:

   2. Praecipe filiis Israel ut ejiciant e castris omnem leprosum, omnem
   seminifluum, et omnem immundum super anima.

   3. Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put
   them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

   3. Tam masculum quam faeminam ejicietis: extra castra ejicietis eos, ne
   contaminent castra sua, quia ego habito in medio eorum.


   2. Command the children of Israel. This passage clearly shews that God,
   in desiring the lepers to be put out of the camp, was not acting as a
   physician by any means, and merely consulting the health of the people:
   but that by this external rite and ceremony He exercised them in the
   pursuit of purity; for, by joining with the lepers those who had an
   issue, [2] and who were defiled by the dead, He instructs the people
   simply to keep away from all uncleanness. The reason, which follows,
   confirms this, -- "that they defile not their camps, in the midst
   whereof He dwells." It is just as if He had said, that all the
   habitations of His elect people were parts of His sanctuary, which it
   was a shame to defile with any pollution. For we know what license men
   give themselves in corrupting [3] the service of God, by mixing, as the
   proverb says, sacred things with profane. Thus we see that the very
   worst of men boast themselves to be anything but the least zealous of
   His worshipers, and spare not to lift up polluted hands, although God
   so sternly repudiates them. It was, then, profitable that the ancient
   people should be reminded by this visible proof, that all those who are
   defiled cannot duly serve God, but that they rather pollute. with their
   filthiness what is otherwise holy, and thus grossly abuse religious
   exercises; and again, that they ought not tobe tolerated in the holy
   congregation, lest their infection should spread to others. Let us now
   briefly examine [2]Leviticus 13

   Leviticus 13

   Leviticus 13:1-59

   1. And the Lord spake untoMoses and Aaron, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   2. When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or
   bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of
   leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of
   his sons the priests.

   2. Homo quum fuerit in cute carnis ejus tumor, vel scabies, vel alba
   macula, et in cute carnis ejus fuerit plaga leprae, ducetur ad Aharon
   sacerdotem, vel ad unum e filiis ejus sacerdotibus.

   3. And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh:
   and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in
   sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy:
   and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

   3. Tune videbit sacerdos plagam in cute carnis: quod si pilus in plaga
   versus fuerit in albedinem, et superficies plagae profundior fuerit
   cute carnis ejus, plaga leprae est, et postquam viderit eum sacerdos
   judicabit illum contaminatum, (vel, contaminabit illum.)

   4. If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight
   be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white;
   then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:

   4. Quod si macula alba fuerit in cute carnis ejus, et profundior non
   fuerit aspectus ejus cute, nec pilus ejus versus fuerit in albedinem,
   includet sacerdos plagam septem diebus.

   5. And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if
   the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the
   skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

   5. Postea videbit eum sacerdos die septimo et si plaga fuerit aequalis
   coram oculis ejus, nee creverit plaga in cute, includet eum sacerdos
   septem diebus secundo.

   6. And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
   behold,if the plague be somewhat dark, and the prague spread not in the
   skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he
   shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

   6. Tune inspiciet sacerdos ipsum die septimo iterum, et si subnigra
   futerit plaga, (vel, obscurius contracta,) nec creverit plaga in cute,
   tune mundum declarabit (vel, mundabit) eum sacerdos: scabies est: et
   lavabit vir vestimenta sua, et mundus erit.

   7. But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath
   been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the
   priest again:

   7. Quod si crescendo creverit scabies in cute postquam ostensus fuerit
   sacerdoti in purgatione ejus, inspi-cietur secundo a sacerdote.

   8. And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin,
   then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

   8. Ubi autem viderit sacerdos; crescere scabiem in cute, immundum
   judicabit cum sacerdos, lepra est judicabit cum sacerdos, lepra est.

   9. When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought
   unto the priest;

   9. Quoties plaga lepre fuerit in homine adducetur ad sacerdotem;

   10. And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white
   in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw
   flesh in the rising;

   10. Et aspiciet sacerdos, et si tumor albus fuerit in cute, et
   mutaverit pilum in albedinem, et ailmentum carnis vivae in tumore,

   11. It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

   11. Lepra inveterate, est in cute carnis ejus: ideoque contaminabit eum
   sacerdos, quia immundus est.

   12. And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
   cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to
   his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

   12. Sin germinando germinaverit lepra in cute, et operuerit lepra totam
   cutem plagae, a capite ejus, et totum aspectuum oculorum sacerdotis:

   13. Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have
   covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the
   plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

   13. Tunc inspiciet sacerdos, et si operuerit lepra totam carnem ejus,
   tunc mundam judicabit plagam: ubi tota versa est in albedinem, munda
   est, (vel, mundus.)

   14. But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

   14. Quo autem die visa fuerit in eo cato viva, immundus erit.

   15. And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
   unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

   15. Et ubi viderit sacerdos carnem vivam, immundum judicabit ipsum,
   caro viva immunda est, lepra est.

   16. Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall
   come unto the priest;

   16. Vel si reversa fuerit caro viva, et conversa in albedinem, tunc
   veniet ad sacerdotem:

   17. And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned
   into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the
   plague: he is clean.

   17. Et inspiciet sacerdos: et si versa fuerit plaga in albedinem,
   mundam judicabit sacerdos plagam illam: munda est.

   18. The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and
   is healed,

   18. Et si fuerit in cute carnis alicujus ulcus, (vel, pustula ardens,)
   et illud sanatum fuerit.

   19. And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright
   spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

   19. Et extiterit in loco ulceris tumor albus, aut macula alba subrufa,
   ostendetur sacerdoti:

   20. And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than
   the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the
   boil.

   20. Et quum inspexerit sacerdos, si pilus profundior fuerit cute, et
   pilus conversus fuerit in albedinem, contaminabit eum sacerdos: quia
   plaga leprae est ex ulcere germinans.

   21. But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs
   therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark;
   then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

   21. Et si viderit cam sacerdos, et non fuerit in ea pilus albus, nec
   fuerit profundior cute, sed fuerit subobscura, tunc includet eum
   sacerdos septem diebus.

   22. And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

   22. Si vero crescendo creverit per cutem, immundum judicabit eum
   sacerdos: plaga est.

   23. But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a
   burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

   23. Si vero suo loco constiterit macula alba, nec ereverit, adustio
   ulceris est: mundum (vel, mundam) judicabit eum sacerdos.

   24. Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
   burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,
   somewhat reddish, or white;

   24. Quum fuerit caro in cujus cute erit adustio ignis, et in viva carne
   adustionis macula alba subrufa, vel alba.

   25. Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the
   bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin,
   it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

   25. Inspiciet eum sacerdos: et, si versus fuerit pilus in albedinem in
   macula illa, et superficies ejus fuerit profundior cute, lepra est in
   adustione germinans: ideo immundam judicabit eam sacerdos, plaga leprae
   est.

   26. But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair
   in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be
   somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

   26. Quod si inspexerit eam sacerdos, et non fuerit in macula pilus
   albus, nec profundior cute, sed fuerit subnigra, includet eum sacerdos
   septem diebus.

   27. And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be
   spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
   unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

   27. Postea inspiciet eum sacerdos die septimo: et si crescendo creverit
   in cute, immundam judicabit eam sacerdos, plaga leprae est.

   28. And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
   skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the
   priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the
   burning.

   28. Quod si in loco suo steterit macula, nec creverit per cutem, et
   eadem fuerit contracta, (vel, subnigra,) tumor adustionis est: ideoque
   mundum judicabit eum sacerdos: quia ardor exustionis est.

   29. If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

   29. Si viro aut mulieri exorta fuerit plaga in capite, aut in barba.

   30. Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
   sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then
   the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a
   leprosy upon the head or beard.

   30. Tune inspiciet sacerdos plagam: et si superficies ejus profundior
   erit cute, et fuerit in ea pilus flavus et tenuis, immundum judicabit
   sacerdos: macula nigra est, lepra capitis aut barbae est.

   31. And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it
   be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair
   in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the
   scall seven days:

   31. Si autem inspexerit sacerdos plagam maculae nigrae, et superficies
   ejus non fuerit profundior cute, nec pilus niger in ea, includet
   sacerdos plagam maculae nigrae septem diebus.

   32. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and,
   behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and
   the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;

   32. Et quum inspexerit sacerdos die septima, si non creverit macula
   illa nigra, nec in ea fuerit pilus, et aspectus maculae nigrae non
   fuerit profundior cute:

   33. He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
   priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

   33. Tune radetur, sed maculam nigram non radet, includetque sacerdos
   maculam nigram septem diebus secundo.

   34. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
   behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
   than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall
   wash his clothes, and be clean.

   34. Postea, inspiciet sacerdos maculam nigram die septima: et, si non
   creverit macula nigra in cute, nec superfides ejus profundior fuerit
   cute, mundum judicabit eum sacerdos: lavabitque vestimenta sua, et
   mundus erit.

   35. But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

   35. Si autem crescendo creverit macula per cutera post purificationem
   suam,

   36. Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
   spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is
   unclean.

   36. Tune inspiciet eam sacerdos: et, si creverit macula illa in cute,
   non requiret ad examen sacerdos pilum flavum: immundus est.

   37. But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black
   hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest
   shall pronounce him clean.

   37. Quod si in oculis ejus constiterit macula, et pilus niger fuerit in
   ea, sanata est macula illa, mundus est, et mundum judicabit eum
   sacerdos.

   38. If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
   spots, even white bright spots;

   38. Quum in cute carnis viri aut mulieris fuerint maculae, maculm
   inquam albae.

   39. Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the
   skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that
   groweth in the skin; he is clean.

   39. Inspiciet sacerdos, et, si in cute carnis corum fuerint maculae
   albae, subnigrae (vel, contractae,) macula alba est quod floret in
   cute, mundus est.

   40. And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is
   he clean.

   40. Vir quum depilatum fuerit caput ejus, calvus est, mundus est.

   41. And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
   toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

   41. Quod si ex parte faciei suae caput habuerit depilatum, recalvaster
   est, mundus est.

   42. And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish
   sore, it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

   42. Quod si in calvitio ejus aut parte depilata fuerit plaga alba,
   subrufa, lepra germinans est in calvitie, vel parte ejus depilata.

   43. Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of
   the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as
   the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

   43. Aspiciet ergo eum sacerdos: et, si tumor plagae albus, rufus in
   calvitio ejus aut parte depilata, sicut species leprae in cute carnis,

   44. He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him
   utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

   44. Vir leprosus est, immundus est: contaminando contaminabit illum
   sacerdos: in capite ejus est plaga ejus.

   45. And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and
   his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
   shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

   45. Leprosi autem in quo fuerit plaga illa, vestimenta erunt scissa, et
   caput ejus nudum, et pilum labri operiet, et Immundus, immundus sum
   clamabit.

   46. All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
   defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall
   his habitation be.

   46. Cunctis diebus quibus fuerit plaga in eo, contaminabitur, immudus
   est: seorsum habitabit: extra castra mansio ejus erit.

   47. The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a
   woollen garment, or a linen garment;

   47. Si in veste fnerit plaga leprae, in veste lanea, aut in veste
   linea,

   48. Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
   whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

   48. Aut in stamine, aut in subtegmine ex lino, aut ex lana, aut in
   pelle, aut in quovis opere pelliceo:

   49. And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the
   skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it
   is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

   49. Et fuerit plaga illa viridis aut rufa in veste, aut in stamine, vel
   in subtegmine, vel in quovis opere pelliceo, plaga leprae est,
   ostendetur sacerdoti.

   50. And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath
   the plague seven days:

   50. Et inspiciet sacerdos plagam, includetque plagam illam septera
   diebus.

   51. And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague
   be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a
   skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting
   leprosy; it is unclean.

   51. Postea inspiciet plagam illam die septimo: si creverlt plaga illa
   per vestera, vel per subtegmen, vel pellem in omni opere pelliceo,
   lepra corodentis plagae est, immunda est.

   52. He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
   woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for
   it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

   52. Comburetque vestem, vel stamen, vel subtegmen ex lana, vel ex lino,
   vel quovis opus pelliceum in quo fuerit plaga illa: quia lepra
   corrodens est, igni comburetur.

   53. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread
   in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of
   skin;

   53. Quod si, ubi inspexerit sacerdos, ecce non creverit plaga illa in
   veste, vel in stamine, vel in subtegmine, vel in quovis opere pelliceo.

   54. Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the
   plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

   54. Tune praecipiet sacerdos, et lavabunt id in quo est plaga: et
   recludet illud septem diebus secundo.

   55. And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed:
   and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague
   be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is
   fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

   55. Inspiciet vero sacerdos, postquam lotum fuerit, plagam illam: et,
   si non mutaverit plaga illa colorem suum, nec plaga creverit, immunda
   est, igni combures illud: corrosio est in calvitio ejus vel in parte
   ejus depilata.

   56. And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
   after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or
   out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

   56. Quod sidum inspexerit sacerdos, ecce, subobscura fuerit plaga
   postquam lota fuit, abscindet eam e veste, vel epelle, vel e stamine,
   vel e subtegmine

   57. And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in
   the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt
   burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

   57. Quod si comspecta fureit ultra in veste, vel in stamine, vel in
   subtegmine, vel in quovis opere pelliceo lepra germinans est, igni
   combures illud in quo fuerit, lavabitur secundo, et mundum erit.

   58. And the garment, either warp or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin
   it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then
   it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

   58. Vestis autem, sive stamen, sive, subtegmen, aut quoivis opus
   pelliceum quod laveris, si recesserit ab eis plagra, lavabitur secundo,
   et mundum erit.

   59. This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or
   linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce
   it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

   59. Haec est lex leprae vestimenti lanei, vel linei, vel staminis, vel

   vel immundum.


   2. When a man shall have in the skin. Since every eruption was not the
   leprosy, and did not render a man unclean, when God appoints the
   priests to be the judges, He distinguishes by certain marks a common
   eruption from the leprosy; and then subjoins the difference between the
   various kinds of leprosy. For the disease was not always incurable;
   but, only when the blood was altogether corrupted, so that the skin
   itself had become hardened by its corrosion, or swollen by its diseased
   state. This, then, must be observed in the first place, that the Greek
   and Latin word lepra, and the Hebrew tsrt tzaragmath, extend further
   than to the incurable disease, which medical men call elephantiasis [4]
   both on account of the hardness of the skin, and also its mottled
   color; not, however, that there is an entire agreement between the
   thickness of the man's skin and that of an elephant, but because this
   disease produces insensibility of the skin. This the Greeks call Psora,
   and if it be not a kind of leprosy, it is nearly allied to it. Thus we
   see that there was a distinction between the scab and leprosy; just as
   now-a-days, if it were necessary to judge respecting the itch, (which
   is commonly called the disease of St. Menanus, [5] the marks must be
   observed, which distinguish it from leprosy. But, as to the various
   kinds of leprosy, I confess that I am not a physician, so as to discuss
   them accurately, and I purposely abstain from close inquiry about them,
   because I am persuaded that the disease here treated of affected the
   Israelites in an extraordinary manner, which we are now unacquainted
   with; for what do we now know of a leprous house? Indeed it is probable
   that, since heathen writers knew that the Jewish people suffered from
   this disease, they laid hold of it as the ground of their falsehood,
   that all the descendants of Abraham were infected with the itch, and
   were driven away from Egypt, lest others should catch it from them.
   That [6] this was an ancient calumny appears from Josephus, both in the
   ninth book of his Antiquities, and in his Treatise against Apion; and
   it is repeated both by C. Tacitus and Justin. Yet I make no doubt that
   the Egyptians, a very proud nation, in order to efface the memory of
   their own disgrace, and of the vengeance inflicted upon them by God,
   invented this lie, and thus grossly turned against this innocent people
   what had happened to themselves, when they were smitten with boils and
   blains. But we shall see hereafter, amongst God's curses, that He
   chastised His people with the same plagues as He had inflicted on the
   Egyptians:

   "The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
   emerods, and with the scab," etc. (Deuteronomy 28:27.)

   Whence it may be probably inferred, that God avenged the crimes of His
   ancient people with special judgments, which are now unknown to us;
   just as afterwards new diseases arose, from which those in old times
   were free. At any rate, Josephus, by clear and solid arguments, exposes
   the absurdity of this accusation, that Moses was driven from Egypt with
   a crowd of exiles, lest they should infect the country with their
   disease; because, if they had been universally affected with this
   malady, he never would have imposed such severe laws for separating the
   lepers from general society.

   God first commands that, whenever a suspicion of leprosy arose, the man
   was to present himself to the priest; if any symptom of leprosy
   appeared, He commands him to be shut up for a period of seven days,
   until it should appear from the progress of the disease that it was
   incurable leprosy. That God should have appointed the priests to be
   judges, and those, too, only of the highest order, is a proof that His
   spiritual service was rather regarded than mere bodily health. If any
   shall inquire whether leprosy is not a contagious disease, and whether
   it be not therefore expedient that all who were affected by it should
   be removed from intercourse with others, I admit, indeed, that such is
   the case, but I deny that this was the main object in view. For, in
   process of time, physicians would have been better able to decide by
   their art and skill: whereas God enjoined this decision upon the
   priests alone, and gave them the rule whereby they were to judge. Nor
   did He appoint the Levites indiscriminately, but only the sons of
   Aaron, who were the highest order, in order that the authority of the
   decision might be greater. It was, then, by a gross error, or rather
   impudence, that the Papal priests (sacrifici) assumed to themselves
   this jurisdiction. It was (they say) the office of the chief priests
   under the Law to distinguish between the kinds of leprosy; and,
   therefore, the same right is transferred to the bishops. But they carry
   the mockery still further: the official [7] the bishop's
   representative, sits as the legitimate judge; he calls in physicians
   and surgeons, from whose answers he pronounces what he confesses he is
   ignorant of himself. Behold how cleverly they accommodate a legal rite
   to our times! The mockery, however, is still more disgusting, when in
   another sense they extend to the whole tribe of priests what they have
   said to belong solely to the bishops; for, since the sin under which
   all labor is a spiritual leprosy, they thence infer that all are
   excluded from the congregation of the faithful until they shall have
   been purged and received by absolution, which they hold to be the
   common office of all the priests. They afterwards add, that judgment
   cannot be pronounced till the cause is heard, and so conclude that
   confession is necessary. But, if they choose to have recourse to
   subtleties, reason would rather conduct us to the opposite conclusion;
   for God did not desire the priests to take cognizance of a hidden
   disease, but only after the manifest symptoms had appeared: hence it
   will follow, that it is preposterous to bring secret sins to judgment,
   and that wretched men are dragged to their confession contrary to all
   law and justice. But, setting aside all these absurdities, an analogy
   must be observed between us and God's ancient people. He of old forbade
   the external uncleanness of the flesh to be tolerated in His people. By
   Christ's coming, the typical. figure has ceased; but we are taught that
   all uncleanness, whereby the purity of His services is defiled, is not
   to be cherished, or borne with amongst us. And surely excommunication
   answers to this ceremony; since by it the Church is purified, lest
   corruptions should everywhere assail it, if wicked and guilty persons
   occupied a place in it promiscuously with the good. The command of God
   that, whilst the disease was obscure and questionable, the infected
   person should be shut up for seven days, recommends moderation to us,
   lest any, who is still curable, should be condemned before his time. In
   fact, this medium is to be observed, that the judge should not be too
   remiss and hasty in pardoning, and still that he should temper severity
   by justice; and especially that he should not be too precipitate in his
   judgment. What we translate "shall pronounce him clean, or unclean," is
   in Hebrew, "shall clean, or unclean him;" thus the dignity of the
   judgment is more fully established, as though it had proceeded from God
   Himself; and assuredly no medical skill could declare on the seventh
   day a leprosy to be incurable, respecting which there was doubt so
   short a time before, unless God should in some special manner discover
   the uncleanness, and guide the eyes of the priests by His Spirit.

   29 If a man or woman. What is here spoken of is not the baldness which
   so often occurs in old age; but that loss of hair, which is the
   consequence of leprosy, is distinguished from any other, the cause of
   which may be some indisposition, and which yet does not pollute a man.
   But, inasmuch as some kinds of baldness do not so greatly differ at
   first sight from leprosy, -- such, for instance, as ophiasis and
   alopecia [8] -- it is therefore necessary to distinguish them.

   44. He is a leprous man, he is unclean. In the first part of the verse
   he says that the leprous man must be counted unclean; but, in the
   latter part, he commands the priest to give sentence against this
   uncleanness, lest it should be carried into the congregation. On this
   ground he says, "his plague is upon his head," which is as much as to
   say, that he is sentenced to just ignominy, for Moses takes it for
   granted that God holds up to public infamy whomsoever He smites with
   leprosy, and thence reminds them that they justly and deservedly bear
   this punishment.

   The two following verses contain the form in which the sentence is
   executed, viz., that the man should wear a rent in his garment, which
   is to be the mark of his disgrace, that he should walk with his head
   bare, and with his mouth covered, (for this I take to be the meaning of
   the covering of his lip;) and besides this, that he is to be the
   proclaimer of his own pollution; finally, that he must dwell without
   the camp, as if banished from communication with men. Moses here [9]
   refers to the existing state of the people, as long as they sojourned
   in the desert; for after they began to inhabit the land, the lepers
   were driven out of the towns and villages to dwell by themselves. I
   know not whether the opinion of some is a sound one, that they were
   enjoined to cover the mouth or lip, lest by the infection of their
   breath they should injure others. My own view is rather, that because
   they were civilly dead, they also bore the symbol of death in having
   the face covered -- as their separation deprived them of the ordinary
   life of men. Where we translate "shall cry, Unclean, unclean," some,
   taking the verb, yqr' yikra, [10] indefinitely, construe it passively,
   "shall be called,:" and I admit that in many passages it has the same
   force as if it were in the plural number. But, because the repetition
   of the word "unclean" is emphatic, it is probable that the word is not
   to be taken simply for "to call," (vocare;) and therefore, I rather
   incline to the opinion that, by the command of the Law, they warned all
   with their own mouth not to approach them, lest any one should
   incautiously pollute himself by touching them; although their
   uncleanness was perhaps proclaimed publicly, so that all might mutually
   exhort each other to beware And Jeremiah seems to allude to this
   passage, where, speaking [11] of the defilements of the city, he says
   that all men cried

   "Unclean; fly ye, fly ye." (Lamentations 4:15)

   58. And the garment. This kind of disease, God, in his infinite
   clemency, has willed to be unknown to us. He has indeed subjected
   woolen garments and furs to the ravages of the moth, and vessels of
   various kinds to rust, and other corruptions; in fact, has surrounded
   the human race with rottenness, in order that everywhere our eyes
   should light on the punishment of sin; but what the leprosy of garments
   may be, is unknown. But its expiation under the Law admonished his
   ancient people that the must carefully beware of even external
   uncleanness, so as to cleanse themselves "from all filthiness of the
   flesh and spirit." It has appeared to me sufficient to touch upon the
   sum of the matter, because it would be almost superfluous labor to
   insist upon the words, although I should be unwilling to condemn the
   diligence of those who examine these points also; but it is not my
   purpose to perform the office of the grammarian.

   Leviticus 14

   Leviticus 14:1-57

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquuntus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He
   shall be brought unto the priest:

   2. Hace erit lex leprosi die pugationis suae, nempe adducetur ad
   sacerdotem.

   3. And the priest shall go forth out of the camp: and the priest shall
   look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;

   3. Et egredietur sacerdos foras extra castra, et inspiciet sacerdos: et
   su sanata fuerit lepra a leproso;

   4. Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
   two birds alive and clean, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

   4. Tunc praecipiet sacrdos ut tollantur ei qui mundatur dae aves vivae,
   mundae, et lignum cedrinum, et coccus vermiculi, et hyssopus.

   5. And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
   earthen vessel over running water:

   5. Et praecipiet sacerdos ut mactetur avis una super vas fictile super
   aquas vivas.

   6. As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and
   the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in
   the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:

   6. Avem vivam tollet, et lignum cedrinum, et cuccum vermiculi, et
   hyssopum: et tinget illa, et avem vivam in sanguine avis mactatae super
   aquas vivas.

   7. And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
   leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the
   living bird loose into the open field.

   7. Et sparget super eum qui mundatur a lepra septem vicibus,
   mundabitque emu: et emitet avem vivam in superficiem agri.

   8. And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
   all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and
   after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of
   his tent seven days.

   8. Et lavabit qui emundatur vestimenta sua, et radet omnem ilum suum,
   lavabitque se aqua, et mundus erit: postea ingredietur castra,
   habitabitque extra tabernaculum suum septem diebus.

   9. But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair
   off his head, and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he
   shall shave off: and he shall wash his cloathes, also he shall wash his
   flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

   9. Die autem septimo radet omnem pilum suum, caput suum, et barbam
   suam, et supercilia oculorum suorum, atque omnem reliquum pilum summ
   radet: lavbit quoque vestimenta sua, postquam laverit carnem suam aqua,
   et purificabit se.

   10. And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish,
   and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three
   tenth-deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and
   one log of oil.

   10. Die autem octavo tallet duos agnos immaculatos, et agnam unam
   anniculam immaculatam, et tres decimas mixturae minha mixta oleao, et
   sextarium unum olei.

   11. And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is
   to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord, at the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation:

   11. Statuetque sacerdos qui mundat virum mundandum, et illa coram
   Jehova ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   12. And the priest shall take one he-lamb, and offer him for a
   trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave
   offering before the Lord:

   12. Tolletque sacerdos agnum unum quem offert in sacrificium pro
   delicto, et sextarium olei, et agitabit ea agitatione coram Jehova.

   13. And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the
   sin-offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the
   sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most
   holy:

   13. Mactabitque agnum in loco in quo mactare solet oblationem pro
   peccato, et holocaustum nempe in loco sanctitatis: quia sicut hostia
   pro peccato, ita oblatio pro delicto, est sacerdotis, sanctitas
   sanctitatum est.

   14. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
   offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of
   him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and
   upon the great toe of his right foot:

   14. Accipietque sacerdos de sanguine oblationis pro delicto, et ponet
   super tenerum auris mundandi dextrae, et super pollicem manus ejus
   dextrae, et super pollicem pedis ejus dextri.

   15. And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into
   the palm of his own left hand:

   15. Accipiet praeterea sacerdos de sextario olei, et fundet in manum
   suam sinistram.

   16. And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
   left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times
   before the Lord:

   16. Tingetque ipse digitum suum dextrum in oleum quod est in manu sua
   sinistra, spargetque de oleo digito suo septem vicibus coram Jehova.

   17. And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put
   upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon
   the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,
   upon the blood of the trespass offering:

   17. De residuo vero olei quod in manu sua ponet sacerdos super tenerum
   auris mundandi dextrae, et super pollicem manus ejus dextrae, et super
   pollicem pedis ejus dextri, ultra sanguinem oblationis pro delicto.

   18. And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
   pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall
   make an atonement for him before the Lord.

   18. Quod autem superest de oleo quod est in manu ejus, ponet super
   caput mundandi: expiabitque eum sacerdos coram Jehova.

   19. And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement
   for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he
   shall kill the burnt offering:

   19. Faciet item sacerdos oblationem pro peccato, emundabitque mundandum
   ab immunditia sua, et postea mactabit holocaustum.

   20. And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering
   upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he
   shall be clean.

   20. Et ascendere faciet sacerdos holocaustum et minham super altare
   expiabitque eum sacerdos, et mundus erit.

   21. And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one
   lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him,
   and one tenth-deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering,
   and a log of oil;

   21. Si autem pauper fuerit, et manus ejus non possit assequi, tum
   accipiet agnum unum in hostiam pro delicto in elevationem ad expiandum
   illum, et decimam partem similae unam permistam oleo pro minha,
   sextariumque olei.

   22. And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to
   get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt
   offering.

   22. Duos praeterea turtures, aut duos filios columbae, quodcunque
   apprehendere poterit manus ejus: eritque unus in hostiam pro pecccato,
   et alter pro holocausto.

   23. And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto
   the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before
   the Lord.

   23. Afferetque ea octavo die purificationis suae ad sacerdotem, ad
   ostium tabernaculi conventionis coram Jehova.

   24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and
   the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering
   before the Lord:

   24. Suscipietque sacerdos agnum oblationis pro delicto, et sextarium
   olei, atque agitabit ea sacerdos elevationem coram Jehova.

   25. And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest
   shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon
   the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the
   thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

   25. Mactabitque agnum oblationis pro delicto, ac tollet sacerdos de
   sanguine oblationis pro delicto, ponetque super tenerum auris mundandi
   dextrin, et super pollicem manus ejus dextrae, et super pollicem pedis
   ejus dextri.

   26. And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left
   hand:

   26. De oleo quoque fundet sacerdos in manum suam sinistram.

   27. And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil
   that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord:

   27. Spargetque sacerdos digito suo dextro de oleo quod est in manu sua
   sinistra septem vicibus coram Jehova.

   28. And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the
   tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb
   of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the
   place of the blood of the trespass offering:

   28. Ponet quoque sacerdos de oleo quod est in manu sua super tenerum
   auris emundandi dextrae, et super pollicem manus ejus dextrae, et super
   pollicem pedis ejus dextri, in loco sanguinis oblationis pro delicto.

   29. And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
   upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for
   him before the Lord.

   29. Quod autem superest de oleo quod est in manu sacerdotis, ponet
   super caput emundandi ad emundandum illum coram Jehova.

   30. And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
   pigeons, such as he can get;

   30. Faciet item unum de turturibus, vel ex pullis columbarum, ex iis
   quae apprehenderit manus ejus.

   31. Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the
   other. for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest
   shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.

   31. Quod inquam apprehenderit manus ejus, faciet unum pro peccato, et
   alterum in holocaustum cum minha, emundabitque sacerdos mundaudum coram
   Jehova.

   32. This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand
   is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

   32. Ita est lex ejus in quo fuerat plaga leprae, cujus manus non
   poterat apprehendere mundationem sui.

   33. And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   33. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   34. When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
   possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of
   your possession;

   34. Quum ingressi fueritis terram Chanaan, quam ego do vobis in
   possessionem, et posuero plagam leprae in domo terrae possessionis
   vestrae:

   35. And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
   saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:

   35. Veniet ille cujus erit domus, renuuntiabitque sacerdoti, dicendo,.
   Tanquam plaga leprae visa est mihi in domo.

   36. Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the
   priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be
   not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the
   house:

   36. Tunc praecipiet sacerdos, et expurgabunt domum antequam ingrediatur
   sacerdos, ut dispiciat plagam, ne polluatur quicquam quod sit in ea
   domo: et postea ingredietur sacerdos ad contemplandam domum

   37. And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in
   the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which
   in sight are lower than the wall;

   37. Tunc considerabit plagam ipsam: et siquidem in plaga quae est in
   parietibus domus, fuerint nigredines, flavedines, vel rubedines: et
   aspectus eorum fuerit depressior reliquo pariete:

   38. Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
   and shut up the house seven days:

   38. Egredietur sacerdos e domo ad ostium domus, et claudet domum septem
   diebus.

   39. And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look:
   and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;

   39. Postea revertetur sacerdos die septimo, et contemplabitur: et
   siquidem creverit plaga in parietibus domus,

   40. Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in
   which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place
   without the city:

   40. Tunc praecipiet sacerdos, et eruent lapides in quibus fuerit plaga
   illa, projicientque illos extra civitatem in locum immundum:

   41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and
   they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into
   an unclean place:

   41. Domum autem radere jubebit intrinsecus per circuitum, et effundent
   pulveremquem abraserint extra civitatem in locum immundum.

   42. And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
   those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the
   house.

   42. Et accipient lapides altos quos reponent loco lapidum illorum, et
   latum aliud capient, et complanabunt domum.

   43. And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after
   that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the
   house, and after it is plaistered;

   43. Quod si reversa fuerit plaga, et effloreat in illa domo postquam
   erui fecit lapides, et abradi domum, et posteaquam obducta fuit:

   44. Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be
   spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is
   unclean.

   44. Tunc ingredietur sacerdos, et considerabit: et siquidem creverit
   plaga in domo, lepra corrodens est ipsa in domo, immunda est.

   45. And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber
   thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth
   out of the city into an unclean place.

   45. Destruetque domum, et lapides ejus, et ligna ejus, atque universum
   lutum domus, educetque extra civitatem in locum immundum.

   46. Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut
   up shall be unclean until the even.

   46. Qui autem ingressus fuerit domum illam omnibus diebus quibus
   jusserit eam claudi, immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

   47. And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that
   eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

   47. Et qui dormierit in ea domo, lavabit vestimenta sua: quique
   comederit in domo, lavabit vestimenta sua.

   48. And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the
   plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered:
   then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is
   healed.

   48. Si autem ingrediendo ingressus fuerit sacerdos: contemplatusque
   viderit non crevisse plagam in ipsa domo, postquam ipsa obducta fuit:
   mundam judicabit sacerdos domum, quia sanata sit plaga illa.

   49. And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood,
   and scarlet, and hyssop:

   49. Tollet itaque ad purificandam domum duos passeres, et lignum
   cedrinum, et coccum vermiculi, ct hyssopum.

   50. And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over
   running water:

   50. Mactabitque passerera unum super vas fictile, super aquas vivas.

   51. And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet,
   and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and
   in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

   51. Capietque lignum cedrinum, et hyssopum, et coccum vermiculi, et
   passerem vivum, et tinget illa in sanguine passeris mactati, et in aqua
   vivente: aspergetque domum septem vicibus.

   52. And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with
   the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood,
   and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

   52. Purificabitque domum illam sanguine passeris, et aqua viva, et
   passere vivo, lignoque cedrino, et hyssopo, et cocco vermiculi.

   53. But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open
   fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

   53. Postea dimittet passerem vivum extra civitatem super faciem agri,
   purgabitque domum, et munda erit.

   54. This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

   54. Ista est lex omnis plagae leprae, et maculae nigrae,

   55. And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

   55. Et leprae vestis, et domus,

   56. And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

   56. Et tumoris, et scabiei, et candentis maculae:

   57. To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law
   of leprosy.

   57. Ad docendum quid agendum, quo die immundus et quo die mundus
   declarandus est.


   2 This shall be the law of the leper. Moses now treats of the manner in
   which those who were cured of leprosy were to be cleansed and restored.
   Thus far he had shewn whom the priest was to admit into the holy
   congregation, and account to be clean; he now prescribes the rite of
   expiation, whereby the people might learn how greatly God abominates
   the uncleanness, which He commands to be purified by a solemn
   propitiation; and also that he who is healed may acknowledge that he is
   rescued from death by God's special blessing, and may in future be more
   diligent in seeking to be pure. For there were two parts in the
   sacrifice here demanded-purification and thanksgiving. But we must ever
   keep in view the object which I have stated in the last chapter, that
   the Israelites were instructed by this ceremony to serve God in
   chastity and purity, and to keep far away from those defilements,
   whereby religion would be profaned. Since, then, leprosy was a kind of
   pollution, God was unwilling that those who were cured of it should be
   received into the holy congregation, [13] except after the offering of
   a sacrifice; as if the priest reconciled them after excommunication. It
   will now be well to discuss the points which are worthy of
   consideration. The office of cleansing is imposed on the priest; yet he
   is at the same time forbidden to cleanse any except those who were
   already pure and clean. In this, on the one hand, God claims for
   Himself the honor of the cure, lest men should assume it; and also
   establishes the discipline which He would have to reign in His Church.
   To make the matter clearer, it belongs to God only to forgive sins;
   what, then, remains to man, except to be the witness and herald of the
   grace which He confers? God's minister can, therefore, absolve none
   whom God has not before absolved. In sum, absolution is not in the
   power or will of man: the minister only sustains an inferior part, to
   endorse God's judgment, or rather to proclaim God's sentence. Hence
   that remarkable expression of Isaiah, "I, even I, am he that blotteth
   out thy transgressions, O Israel, and none but me." [14] (Isaiah
   43:25.) In which sense, too, God everywhere promises by the prophets
   that the people shall be clean, when He shall have cleansed them.
   Meanwhile, however, this does not prevent those who are called to the
   office of teaching from purging the uncleanness of the people in a
   certain peculiar way. For, since faith alone purifies the heart, in so
   far as it receives the testimony which God proffers by the mouth of
   man, the minister who testifies that we are reconciled to God, is
   justly reckoned to take away our pollution. This expiation is still in
   force, though the ceremony has long ceased to be in use. But, since the
   spiritual healing, which we receive by faith, proceeds from the mere
   grace of God, the ministry of man does not at all detract from His
   glory. Let us, then, remember that these two things are perfectly
   consistent with each other, that God is the sole author of our purity;
   and yet that the method, which He uses for our justification, must not
   on that account be neglected. And this is properly referred to
   discipline, that whosoever has been once cast out of the holy
   congregation by public authority, must not be received again except
   upon professing penitence and a new life. We must observe, too, that
   this jurisdiction was given to the priests not only on the ground that
   they represented Christ, but also in respect to the ministry, which we
   have in common with them.

   3 And the priest shall go forth. This is the examination, which was
   more fully treated of in the last chapter, without which it was not
   lawful to receive him who had been once rejected. The priest's command,
   which is mentioned immediately afterwards, I refer to the Levites, some
   one of whom probably accompanied the priest to prepare the sacrifice,
   that thus the priests might only discharge the principal duty. The sum
   of the rite respecting the two birds tends to this, that the cleansing
   from leprosy was a kind of resurrection Two birds were placed before
   their eyes; the liberty of one was purchased by the blood of the other;
   because the former was not let go until it had been first dipped in the
   blood and the water; and thus the matter of sprinkling was prepared for
   the man's purification. The sevenfold repetition was intended to
   impress more deeply on men's memories a continual meditation on God's
   grace; for we know that by this number perfection is often expressed in
   Scripture. With the same object, he who had been cured shaved his hair,
   and washed in water. Yet he did not return home on the first day, but
   on the eighth. Meantime, on the seventh day he shaved his beard, and
   his eyebrows, and all the hair of his head; he washed himself and his
   garments, and then proceeded to the sacrifice. So difficult is it to
   accustom men to a serious acknowledgment of the two points, to hold
   their vice in detestation, and worthily to estimate the grace of God
   whereby they are delivered.

   10. And on the eighth. As infants on the eighth day after they were
   cleansed from the uncleanness which they had brought from the womb,
   were grafted into the Church, and made members of it; so now the eighth
   day is prescribed for the restoration of those who, in the cure that
   they have received, are as it were born again; for they are accounted
   dead whom the leprosy had banished from the holy congregation. A
   sacrifice is therefore appointed which may renew the circumcision that
   had been in some measure effaced. Now, the meaning of all the things
   here mentioned is not clear to myself, and I would not have my readers
   too curious respecting them. Some may be probably accounted for; the
   right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right
   foot, were sprinkled with the blood of the offering, because the leper
   was restored to the ordinary habits and customs of life, so as to have
   freedom of walk and action, and free conversational intercourse; for in
   the ear there is a mutual correspondence between speaking and hearing.
   The head is anointed, or cleansed with the oil, that nothing impure
   should remain in his whole body [15] God spare the poor and lowly, and
   does not compel them to offer the two lambs, lest they should be
   burdened beyond their means; whence it appears, that sacrifices are not
   estimated according to their intrinsic value, but according to the
   pious feeling which disposes each on liberally to offer in proportion
   to what is given him.

   34. When ye be come into the land. Another sort of leprosy is here
   treated of, as to which we may not unreasonably rejoice that it is now
   unknown to us. But, as God had honored that people with extraordinary
   privileges, so it was consistent that their ingratitude should be
   punished by more severe penalties, if they defiled the gifts in which
   they excelled. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that punishments
   were inflicted upon them, which it fills us with surprise and horror to
   hear of. It was a sad sight to behold the leprosy invading the human
   body; but there was something portentous to perceive it affecting their
   houses also, and driving out the owners and their families; for if they
   wittingly and voluntarily remained there, the contagion spread to
   themselves and all their furniture. But, since God marked with public
   ignominy those whose houses were struck with leprosy, He commands them
   to confess their guilt, and not only when the evil had made much
   advance, but when any suspicion of it had begun to exist. It appears,
   too, from the Law, that some were but lightly chastised: for, if after
   the priest's inspection, in seven days the plague did not increase on
   the scraped walls, the possessor returned to his house. God punished
   others more severely, and it was necessary that the building should be
   utterly destroyed, because the pollution was incurable. But, although
   these were tokens of God's wrath, yet, inexpiating the uncleanness, He
   exercised His people in the study of purity; for it was just as if He
   drove away from approaching His sanctuary those who came from an
   unclean house. The sense, then, was that. they should each of them
   diligently endeavor to keep their houses pure, and chaste, and free
   from every stain. But if, through God's mercy, the plague ceased, a
   sacrifice of thanksgiving was to be offered, as for the human beings
   (who had been healed.) The next chapter, in which general pollutions
   and their purifications are not treated of, but only one kind of
   pollution is glanced at, which has reference to fleshly lust, would
   perhaps be suitably introduced under the Seventh Commandment; but it
   will presently appear from the context that it must be brought under
   this head.

   cunctis diebus fluxus immunditiae suae erit sicut diebus menstrui sui,
   immunda est.

   26. Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto
   her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall

   28. But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
   herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

   28. Quod si mundata fuerit a fluxu suo, tunc numerabit sibi septem
   dies, et postea mundabitur.

   29. And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two
   young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   29. Die autem octava tollet sibi duos turtures, aut duos pullos
   columbinos: afferetque illos ad sacerdotem ad ostium tabernaculi
   conventionis.

   30. And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
   other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
   her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

   30. Et faciet sacerdos unum in hostiam pro peccato, et alterum in
   holocaustum: emundabitque illam sacerdos coram Jehova a fluxu
   immunditiae suae.

   31. Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
   uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile
   my tabernacle that is among them.

   31. Separabitque filios Israel ab imnmnditias suas, ne moriantur
   propter immunditias suas, dum polluertint tabernaculum, quod est in
   medio eorum.

   32. This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
   goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

   32. lsta est lex patientis fluxum seminis, et ejus ex quo egreditur
   effusio seminis, ut sit immundus propter illam.

   33. And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an
   issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her
   that is unclean.

   33. Et aegrotantis in fluxu suo, et ejus qui profundit fluxum suum,
   sive sit masculus, sive foemina, et viri qui dormierit cum immunda.


   2 When any man hath a running issue. He here alludes to other species
   of contamination, for which a solemn purification is required. And,
   first, he teaches that men are defiled by the flow of the seminal
   fluid, which occurs in two ways, either when it involuntarily bursts
   out in sleep, or when it escapes gradually in the disease, which the
   Greeks call gonor'rhoia This Supplement might, as I have said, be
   appended to the Seventh Commandment, because every [17] indisposition
   arising from lust appears here to be condemned; but, if we look more
   closely, we shall perceive that it is a general law for the cultivation
   of purity, and which must not be confined to chastity alone. For this
   flux, arising from disease and debility, unless it be contracted from
   immoderate venery, has nothing in common with venereal lust. Besides,
   what is immediately after added concerning the menstruation of women,
   is connected with other forms of uncleanness and defilement. The sum
   then is, that the seminal-flux is reckoned among the pollutions which
   prevented the Israelites from entering the tabernacle, and from the
   external service of God; and thence the rule must always be borne in
   mind, that whatever proceeds from an unclean man is corrupt, and that
   no one can duly offer either himself, or what he possesses, to God,
   except he who is pure and perfect in soul and body. Thus Paul explains
   the end and object of this ceremony, when he exhorts believers that,
   being received as God's peculiar people, they should cleanse themselves

   "from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit."
   (2 Corinthians 7:1.)

   But Moses further declares, that uncleanness is contracted, not only
   when the seed is emitted, but when it is retained; and that not only is
   the man himself rendered unclean, but whatever he may have touched --
   his bed, his seat, his saddle, his clothes; and that the contagion
   extends to others also, if any should have lain on the same bed, or
   ridden on the same saddle. Thus did God desire to impress them with
   horror, that they might be more accustomed to fly from all impurity.
   Nor would the crime have been detestable: in itself, had not spiritual
   purity been set forth under this external exercise and symbol. Thus,
   too, in (Psalm 24:3, 4), the truth of this figure is described:

   "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His
   holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart."

   Therefore he who was conscious of no sin in the seminal-flux, still
   must be reminded by this sign of the corruption of his nature; and at
   the same time be an example to others, that all should diligently take
   heed to themselves, because corruption cleaves to the whole human race.
   In the ablution the remedy of the evil was proposed, since the mark of
   ignominy induced them to repentance. It is expedient that whosoever is
   infected with any stain should be brought to shame, so as to be
   displeased with himself; but the acknowledgment of the evil would
   produce despair, unless the hope of pardon were associated with it.
   Therefore, those to whom purification was necessary, are always sent to
   water; and, whenever water is mentioned, the passage in St. John should
   be brought to mind, that Christ came "by water and blood," to purge and
   expiate all uncleanness. (1 John 5:6.) Besides the water, a sacrifice
   of turtle doves, or two young pigeons is added; and this has reference
   to the same thing; viz., that purification for the unclean must be
   sought for elsewhere, which we have at length obtained by the sacrifice
   of Christ.

   19. And if a woman have an issue. Women are now spoken of who suffer
   under a twofold issue of blood; for with almost all it occurs every
   month, (whence it is called menses, or menstruation,) and some labor
   under a constant hemorrhage. He declares both to be unclean; and, after
   menstruation, a certain period of separation is appointed, during which
   the law prohibited their cohabitation with men; but, if the blood
   flowed beyond the usual time, the time of purification is postponed
   until it ceased. Whence it appears, that in every shameful thing the
   Jews were reminded of their uncleanness, that thus they might be
   accustomed to modesty and seek after purity. And this still more
   clearly appears at the end of the chapter, where it is said, (v. 3l,)
   "Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness;
   that they die not -- when they defile my tabernacle." God, I say,
   briefly sets forth His intention that He would drive away all
   profanation far from His people; because he desires sincerity to
   prevail amongst his worshippers, and cannot bear his tabernacle to be
   polluted by any stain.

   Deuteronomy 23

   Deuteronomy 23:1, 2

   1. He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off,
   shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

   1. Non ingredietur qui contusione fractos aut abscissos habet
   testiculos, in congregationem Jehovae

   2. A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to
   his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the
   LORD.

   2. Non ingredietur spurius congregationem Jehovae: etiam genereatione
   decima non ingredietur congregationem Jehovae


   1 He that is wounded. What is here delivered respecting those who are
   mutilated, and who are bastards, has a similar object; lest the Church
   of God should be onctaminate by foul stains, and thus religion should
   lose its honor. Moses rejects from the congregation of the faithful two
   sorts of men, viz, eunuchs and bastards. But, before we treat of the
   subject itself, the definition of the words is to be considered. The
   first question is, that it is to enter into the congregation; the
   second, what it is to be wounded in the stones; the third, who are the
   mmzrym, mamzerim, which we have translated bastards, (spurios). Many
   understand that both are rejected from the church, lest they should
   undertake any public office in it; others, lest they should marry wives
   of the seed of Abraham; because it would not be fair that women should
   be thrown away upon bastards, (Lat, mamzeris;) and it would be absurd
   that those who were created to multiply God's people, should marry
   impotent persons, (effoeminatis). But both these opinions appear to me
   to be tame. For what is afterwards added respecting certain foreign
   nations cannot be so taken, that no government or dignity should be
   entrusted to them; besides, by "the congregation of the Lord," the
   purity and holiness of religion is sufficiently expressed. I do not
   doubt, then, but that Moses prohibits those who are defiled by these
   two stains from communicating in the sacrifices. For although they were
   circumcised as well as the rest of the chosen people, still God would
   have them bear this mark of their disgrace, that they might be an
   example to others, and that the people might be more diligent in
   preserving themselves from all pollution. This, then, is to be
   concluded that the privilege which was peculiar to the legitimate
   Israelites, was to be denied them of being participators and associates
   [19] in the sacrifices. As to the wounded testicles, the Jews dispute
   more curiously, in my opinion, that the subject warrants, and after all
   miss the right meaning. For God intended nothing else than to exclude
   from the congregation of His people, wherever holy assemblies were
   held, those who were mutilated or defective in the genital organs;
   although by synecdoche, He comprehends more than are specified.
   Finally, by condemning this external bodily defect He commends the
   excellency of His people that they may remember themselves to be His
   chosen property, not that they should pride themselves upon it [20] but
   that the holiness of their life may correspond with such high nobility.

   2. A bastard shall not enter. All agree that by the word mmzr, mamzer,
   a bastard is signified, who is born of an uncertain father; but they
   take it in different ways, For some extend it to all bastards who
   spring from fornication, whilst others imagine that it refers to those
   only whose origin is doubtful, and who are called vulgo geniti; viz,
   whose mothers, in their base and common prostitution of themselves,
   have brought it about by their gross licentiousness, that their
   children should be born from this monstrous medley, as it were. This
   second opinion I approve of most. But, by this symbol God would
   admonish the seed of Abraham how exalted was its dignity, as being
   separate from the polluted heathen. Meanwhile, He would not altogether
   exclude these unhappy persons from the hope of salvation, although, by
   no fault of their own, they were unable to give the name of their
   father; but He only humbled them by a temporal punishment, and desired
   that their example should be profitable to others.

   Numbers 19

   Numbers 19:1-22

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   1. Loquutus est insuper Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   2. This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded,
   saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red
   heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came
   yoke:

   2. Hoc est statutum Legis quod praecepit Jehova, dicendo, Alloquere
   filios Israel, ut afferant ad te vaccam rufam perfectam, in qua non sit
   macula, super quam non ascenderit jugum.

   3. And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her
   forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:

   3. Et dabitis eam Eleazar sacerdoti, qui educet eam extra castra, et
   mactandam curabit ante se.

   4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
   sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the
   congregation seven times:

   4. Capietque Eleazar sacerdos de sanguine ejus digito suo, et sparget e
   regione faciei tabernaculi conventionis de sanguine ejus septera
   vicibus.

   5. And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,
   and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

   5. Postea comburendam curabit vaccam in oculis suis: pellem ejus, ct
   carnem ejus, et sanguinem ejus una cum fimo ejus comburet.

   6. And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and
   cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

   6. Tunc accipiet sacerdos lignum cedrinum, et hyssopum, et coccum
   vermiculi, projicietque in medium combustionis vaccae.

   7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh
   in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest
   shall be unclean until the even.

   7. Et lavabit vestes suas sacerdos, lavabit quoque carnem suam aqua, et
   postea ingredietur castra, immundusque erit sacerdos usque ad vesperam.

   8. And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
   his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

   8. Ille quoque qui combusserit eam, lavabit vestimenta sua aqua,
   lavabit et carnem suam aqua, immundusque erit usque ad vesperam.

   9. And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of' the heifer,
   and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept
   for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of
   separation: it is a purification for sin.

   9. Colliget autem vir mundus cinerem illius vaccae, et ponet illum
   extra castra in loco mundo: eritque congregationi filiorum Israel in
   custodiam in aquam separationis: nam expiatio est.

   10. And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
   clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the
   children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,
   for a statute for ever.

   10. Et lavabit qui collegerit cinerem vaccae vestimenta sua,
   immundusque erit usque ad vesperam: et erit filiis Israel et peregrino
   qui pere-grinatur in medio eorum, in statutum perpetuum.

   11. He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
   days.

   11. Qui tetigerit cadaver omnis animae hominis, immundus erit septem
   diebus.

   12. He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
   seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third
   day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

   12. Ipse purificabitur eo die tertia, et die septima mundus erit: quod
   si non purificatus fuerit die tertia, die septima non erit mundus.

   13. Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
   purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that
   soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was
   not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet
   upon him.

   13. Quicunque tetigerit mortuum, animam hominis qui mortuus fuerit, et
   non fuerit purificatus, tabernaculum Jehovae polluit: et excidetur
   anima illa ex Israel: quia aqua separationis non fuit aspersa super
   eum, immundus erit, adhuc immunditia ejus erit in ipso

   14. This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: All that come into the
   tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

   14. Haec est lex, Quum quis mortuus fuerit in tabernaculo, quicunque
   ingressus fuerit tabernaculum, et quicquid fuerit tabernaculo, immundum
   erit septem diebus.

   15. And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
   unclean.

   15. Omne item vas apertum super quo non fuerit operculum adjectum,
   immundum est.

   16. And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open
   fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be
   unclean seven days.

   16. Quicunque praeterea tetigerit in superficie agri occisum gladio,
   aut mortuum, aut os hominis, aut sepul-chrum, immundus erit septem
   diebus.

   17. And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt
   heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto
   in a vessel:

   17. Tollentque pro immundo de pulvere combustionis oblationis pro
   peccato, et ponent super eum aquam vlvam in vase.

   18. And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and
   sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the
   persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one
   slain, or one dead, or a grave:

   18. Capiet item hyssopum, et intinget in aquam vir mundus, et sparget
   super tabernaculum, et super omnem supellectilem, et super animas quae
   fuerint ibi, ac super eum qui tetigit os illud, vel occisum, vel
   mortuum, vel sepulchrum.

   19. And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third
   day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify
   himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be
   clean at even.

   19. Asperget, inquam, mundus super immundum die tertia, et die septima,
   et mundabit eum die septima: postea lavabit vestimenta sua: lavabit
   quoque sese aqua, et mundus erit in vespera.

   20. But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
   that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath
   defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not
   been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

   20. Vir autem qui immundus fuerit, et non purificaverit se, excidetur
   anima illa medio congregationis, quia sanctuarium Jehovae polluit: aqua
   separationis non est aspersa super eum immundus est.

   21. And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
   sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that
   toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

   21. Et erit els in statutum perpetuum: et qui sparserit aquam
   separationis, lavabit vestimenta sua: quique tetigerit aquam
   separationis, immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

   22. And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and
   the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

   22. Et quicquid tetigerit immundus, immundum erit: et anima quae
   tetigerit ipsum, immunda erit usque ad vesperam.


   2 This is the ordinance of the law. Because it could not but occur
   that, whilst the faithful were engaged in the world, they should often
   contract some pollution by their contact with its many impurities, the
   composition of the water is here described, by the sprinkling of which
   they might wash away, and expiate their uncleanness: and then certain
   kinds of pollution are specified, whereof the purification is required.
   God commands that a red heifer should be slain, which had never been
   subjected to the yoke; and that it should be burnt without the camp,
   together with its skin and dung; that the ashes should be gathered by a
   man that was clean, and laid up without the camp for the common use of
   the people. But, in order that the water, which was mixed with these
   ashes, should have the power of reconciliation, God at the same time
   commands that the blood should be sprinkled seven times before the
   altar by the finger of the priest. The object of this ceremony was
   twofold: for God would awaken the attention of the people to reflect
   more closely upon their impurity; and, although they might be pure
   within, still would have them carefully look around them, lest they
   should be polluted from without; and also taught them that, as often as
   they were infected by any pollution, expiation was to be sought for
   from elsewhere, viz., from sacrifice and sprinkling; and thus admonish
   them that men inquire in vain in themselves for the remedies demanded
   for their purification, because purity can only proceed from the
   sanctuary. Those, who speculate subtilty on the details, advance some
   questionable matters. I leave them, therefore, to the enjoyment of
   their conceits; let it suffice for us to consider generally what God
   referred to in this ceremony, and what advantage accrued from it to the
   people. By the red color, they suppose that sin is signified.
   Meanwhile, lest they should run into a manifest contradiction, they are
   obliged absurdly to interpret what follows, that He required a heifer
   perfect and without blemish, as if it were said that there should be no
   difference of color in her hair; whereas God demands the same thing as
   in the other sacrifices, which were rejected as faulty if any mark of
   deformity existed in them. And in this sense it is added that she
   should never have borne a yoke. Therefore I make no doubt but that God
   enjoined that a pure heifer, neither mutilated nor lame, should be
   chosen; and, that her perfectness might be more apparent, as yet
   unbroken to the yoke. What, then, is the meaning of the red color?
   First of all, I prefer confessing my ignorance to advancing anything
   doubtful; but it may be conjectured that a common and ordinary color
   was rather chosen, lest it should be too conspicuous, as it would have
   been, if either white or black. But this should be deemed sure, that a
   perfect heifer, and one free from every blemish, was to be offered, and
   one too, which had not been broken to bear the yoke by the hands of
   men, that the purification might have nothing of humanity about it.:
   But the command to offer her was given to the whole people; because, in
   order that we may be partakers of ablution, it is necessary that each
   of us should offer Christ to the Father. For, although He only, and
   that but once, has offered Himself, still a daily offering of Him,
   which is effected by faith and prayers, is enjoined to us, not such as
   [22] the Papists have invented, by whom in their impiety and
   perverseness, the Lord's Supper has been mistakenly turned into a
   sacrifice, because they imagined that Christ must be daily slain, in
   order that His death might profit us. The offering, however, of faith
   and prayers, of which I speak, is very different, and by it alone we
   apply to ourselves the virtue and fruit of Christ's death.

   3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar. A clear distinction is here made
   between two offerings; for the people are not permitted to kill the
   heifer, but this is the peculiar office of the priest. Thus the people
   offered vicariously by the hand of the priest; and in this way also at
   present, although we set Christ before God's face in order to
   propitiate Him, still it is necessary that Christ Himself should
   interpose, and exercise the office of a priest. Again, the heifer was
   to be taken outside the camp, as a sign that it was accursed, since it
   was an atonement. On which account, too, the atoning victims, whose
   blood was carried into the Holy of Holies, were burnt without the camp;
   the truth of which figure was accomplished in Christ, who therefore
   suffered outside the gates of the city, as the Apostle testifies.
   (Hebrews 13:11-12.) But, because this was a species of rejection, lest
   the heifer should be less accounted of, or lest the Israelites should
   think her polluted by the curse, God shews that her blood was sacred
   and of a sweet savor, by commanding that it should be sprinkled seven
   times upon the altar, which might not be profaned by anything unclean.
   The same thing is most clearly seen in Christ; for although He was made
   a curse for us, and is called "sin," because by bearing our accursed
   sins upon the cross, He was our atoning victim, yet nothing was thereby
   taken from His purity, so as to prevent His holiness from being the
   sanctification of the whole world. For He offered Himself through the
   Spirit, and by His own blood entered into the holy place, and His death
   is elsewhere called by Paul, "a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor."
   (Hebrews 9:11-12; Ephesians 5:2; Philippians 4:18).

   6 And the priest shall take cedar-wood. That the sprinkling of the
   blood might be conjoined with that of the water, the cedar-wood, and
   hyssop, and scarlet, thread, with which the sprinkling was wont to be
   made, were cast into the fire; for, unless the Israelites had been
   admonished by this visible sign, they would not have so clearly known
   that they were not only washed with the water, but that by the offering
   of the sacrifice also their uncleanness was removed. But it was not
   enough that the blood should be poured forth, unless, as has been
   already seen, they were purified by its aspersion. But, for as much as
   the scent of cedar-wood is precious, and in hyssop there is a cleansing
   property, we gather from hence also that the victim was pure, although
   it bore their sins together with the curse and expiation. Peter teaches
   us how we are sprinkled with the blood of Christ, viz., through the
   Spirit, (1 Peter 1:2;) nay, John shews us in his Canonical Epistle,
   that we find all the parts of this ceremony in Christ, where he writes
   that Christ "came by water and blood," and "it is the Spirit that
   beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth." (1 John 5:6.)

   7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes. At first sight there seems to
   be a discrepancy in the facts, that the heifer was sacred to God, and
   pure, and still that the priest was polluted by touching it; yet they
   accord very well with each other. But that both the priest as well as
   the minister who made the burning, were unclean until the evening,
   ought to have forcibly struck the people, and taught them the more to
   abominate sin. And, since it was not permitted to any but a man that
   was clean to gather the ashes, not that they should be laid anywhere
   but in a clean place, it was manifested by this sign that there was no
   impurity in the sacrifice itself, but that from an extraneous and
   adventitious pollution; because it was destined to purge away
   uncleanness, it was accounted in a certain sense unclean. Whence too
   the water, into which the ashes were thrown, was called the water of
   separation, as well as the expiation [23] For this translation which I
   have given is the right one; and others improperly render it "for
   waters of separation, and for expiation." The old interpreter has not
   given the sense amiss, as far as regards this word, "because the heifer
   is burnt for sin." But since in Hebrew the word,cht'h chateah [24]
   means not only wickedness or sin, but also the sacrifice on which the
   curse is imposed; what Moses intended to convey is better expressed by
   the word "expiation." But the expression "separation" has reference to
   the men, whose personal uncleanness excluded them from the holy
   congregation. But the question arises, why this ordinance is pronounced
   to be common to the strangers who sojourned in the land of Israel, as
   well as to the natives; because it was by no means reasonable that the
   uncircumcised should be purified. The reply is easy, that such
   strangers are not adverted to as were altogether aliens from the
   people, but those who, although born of heathen parentage, had embraced
   the Law. These God equalizes with the children of Abraham in the
   sacrifices and other religious services; for if their condition were
   different, the-church, into the body of which they were ingrafted,
   would be rent asunder.

   11. He that toucheth the dead body. He now recites certain forms of
   pollution in which the washing was necessary; all of them, however,
   come to the point, that men are defiled by the touch of a corpse or,
   bones, or a grave. Nor is there here any distinction between the body
   of a person who is slain, or of one who has died in bed; whence it
   follows that death is here set forth as a mirror of God's curse: And
   assuredly, if we consider its origin and cause, the corruption of
   nature, whereby the image of God is defaced, presents itself in every,
   dead man; for, unless we were altogether corrupt, we should not be born
   to perish But God also taught His people by another mode of signifying
   it, that uncleanness is contracted by our communication with the
   unfruitful works of darkness. For the Apostle (Hebrews 6:1) calls them
   "dead works," either from their consequences, or because, as faith is
   the life of the soul, so unbelief keeps it in death. Since, then, the
   corpse the bones, the grave, designate whatever we bring from the womb,
   because, until we are born again, and God quickens us by His Spirit and
   faith, we are dead while we live; there is no question but that the
   children of Israel were reminded, that in order to keep themselves pure
   before God, they must abstain from all corruption; inasmuch as, if they
   were rendered unclean by their contact with a dead man, they must
   immediately have recourse to ablution. In fine, the ceremony had no
   other object than that they should serve God in pureness from the sins
   of the flesh; and exercise themselves in constant thoughts of
   repentance, whilst, if they fell from their purity, they should labor
   to obtain reconciliation with God, by means of sacrifice and ablution.

   13. Whosoever toucheth the dead body. The severity of. the capital
   punishment shews how very pleasing to God is purity. If any one bad
   forgotten to sprinkle himself on the third or the seventh day, he might
   redeem his negligence by a prolongation of the term, because he only
   postponed his purification to another day; but it was a capital crime
   to enter the sanctuary in his uncleanness, since thus holy and profane
   things would be mixed together, nay, the altar would have been polluted
   as well as the whole service of God. But indeed the act of touching a
   dead body was of slight importance, nor was it to be deemed an
   atrocious crime; but here the external defilement is not regarded in
   itself, as if God were wroth on account of a stain contracted by the
   performance of a pious duty. [25] Rather must the object of the
   ceremony be considered, for God designed by these rudiments to teach
   the Israelites, like children, that if any one should pollute sacred
   things by his impurity, he would by no means be tolerated in this
   audacity. In this then consisted the religious import of the
   transaction, that the worship of God was too precious for the
   Israelites to be permitted to contaminate it with impunity. Whence we
   gather that the punishment was denounced as against sacrilege. In sum,
   it comes to this, that God is not duly worshipped except with a sincere
   heart and pure hands; and that if any pollution be contracted, there is
   need of expiation before a free access is re-opened to holy things. But
   it must be remarked as to the contact, that it was accounted the same
   thing, whether the corpse lay in a field or a house; whilst, if any one
   died in a tent, men were polluted by merely entering it, and likewise
   vessels without covers thus became unclean.

   22. And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth. Others translate it, --
   "Whosoever toucheth an unclean thing shall be unclean." for, since the
   Hebrew is without a neuter gender, [26] the relative 'sr, asher, and
   the noun htm', hattame, may be either masculine or neuter; and either
   sense would not be unsuitable; except that we gather from the second
   clause, that reference is rather made here to the contagion with which
   unclean persons infect either men or garments, or other articles. For
   those who had touched a dead body, or bones, or a grave, were not only
   unclean until the evening, but for seven entire days. But it appears
   that this was added in conclusion, lest the Jews should murmur at the
   severity of the punishment, as if God would inflict the penalty of
   death for a trifling sin. In this way, then, Moses shews how great is
   the guilt incurred by those who, being unclean, intrude into the
   sanctuary; because, as far as in them lies, they pollute the holiness
   of God, and not without intolerable impertinence. Hence appears to be
   taken the reproof of the Prophet, when he reproaches the Jews with
   having done nothing but defile the worship of God with their
   sacrifices; for he proposes this question to the priests, -- "If one
   bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do
   touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be
   holy?" After they have replied in the negative, he asks again, "If one
   that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be
   unclean?" and they answer, "It shall be unclean." Whence the Prophet
   infers:

   "So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord,
   and so is the work of their hands; and that which they offer there is
   unclean." (Haggai 2:12-14.)

   This passage shews us the legitimate use of the ceremony, that corrupt
   and perverse worshippers [27] bring disgrace rather than honor on God,
   whilst they mix up His holy name with their profanations.

   their impurities [28]

   Deuteronomy 23

   Deuteronomy 23:9-14

   9. When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from
   every wicked thing.

   9. Quum egressus fueris in exercitu contra hostes tuos, cave ab omni re
   mala.

   10. If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
   uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of
   the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

   10. Si fuerit in te quispiam non mundus casu nocturno, egredietur extra
   castra, nec ingredietur in medium castrorum

   11. But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with
   water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

   11. quum autem aspexerit vesperum, lavabit se aqua: et quum occubuerit
   sol, ingredietur castra.

   12. Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt
   go forth abroad:

   12. Locus etiam erit tibi extra castra, egredierisque illuc foras.

   13. And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when
   thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn
   back and cover that which cometh from thee:

   13. Paxillus item erit tibi inter vasa tua, et quando desidebis extra,
   fodies ipso, et conversus operies excrementa tua.

   14. For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver
   thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy
   camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from
   thee.

   14. Jehova enim Deus ambulat per medium castrorum tuorum, ut eripiat
   te, et tradat inimicos tuos coram te. Sit igitur in castris tuis
   sanctitas, ne videat in te turpitudinem aliquam, et avertatur abs te.


   9. When the host goeth forth. What he had taught with respect to the
   preservation of purity at home, and in time of peace, he now extends to
   times of war also, so that they might keep themselves clean from all
   defilement even in the midst of the clang of arms. We know how greatly
   laws are disregarded during war, when all things are under the control
   of violence rather than reason; and we know that much license is wont
   to be given to soldiers, which would be by no means tolerated in peace.
   God would remedy this evil by requiring the Israelites to aim at the
   same purity in war as in peace; for this is a special law which forbids
   their being dissolute and unruly in war-time, as He has before
   condemned all impurity in general, as if He had said, that under no
   pretext would they be excusable, if they neglect the duty of
   cultivating habits of purity. For He does not command them to be
   cautious in the army and in the camp, as if they might sin with
   impunity when at home, but admonishes them that God would by no means
   excuse them although they should allege the necessity of war. Much more
   would the crime be aggravated, if they should pollute themselves in
   peace and when their minds were calm. Whence we gather that it is vain
   to catch at empty excuses for the violation of God's commands in any
   respect; for, however difficult the performance of duty may be, still
   God never resigns His rights. Now, if war, which seems to dispense with
   laws, does not excuse crime, much greater, as I have said, shall their
   guilt be accounted, who in a tranquil condition of life are
   licentiously carried away by sin.

   10. If there be among you. He enumerates two kinds of pollution,
   whereby the Israelites may know what is meant by their keeping from the
   "wicked thing." First, He pronounces to be unclean, and casts out of
   the camp those who may have had a filthy dream, until they shall have
   washed themselves in the evening. Secondly, He forbids them to defile
   the camp with what passes from the bowels; and not only this, but, even
   when they have gone outside the camp, He commands them to bury their
   excrement beneath the earth, lest any filthiness should appear. Yet it
   is probable that, by synecdoche, everything is referred to which
   rendered men unclean and polluted. But Moses, speaking as to soldiers,
   considered it sufficient to tell them briefly, that although they might
   be occupied with war, cleanliness must still be attended to. By "what
   chanceth at night," all are agreed in understanding a flow of semen;
   from whence we infer how greatly impurity defiles a man, since
   uncleanness is contracted even from foul dreams. As to the second part,
   some desire to appear quick and clever by attacking Moses, because he
   has introduced among the precepts of holiness, that none should relieve
   his bowels in the camp. Forsooth, they say, the smell might offend the
   nostrils of God! But their silly petulance is easily rebutted; for God
   would by such rudiments keep His ancient people in the way of duty,
   lest liberty even in the most trifling things should lead them onwards
   to audacity. If they had been permitted to defile every part of the
   camp, the people would presently have been hardened against filthiness
   of every sort. Thus they were held back by this rein, that they might
   more earnestly apply their minds to spiritual integrity. They also are
   mistaken who suppose that this was a sanitary precaution, lest the
   smell should produce diseases, and be injurious to their bodily health.
   For Moses plainly declares that he not only had regard to what was
   wholesome, or even to what was decent in the eyes of men; but rather
   that he would accustom the people to abhor uncleanness, and to keep
   themselves pure and unpolluted -- for he adds, that God presided in the
   camp, to protect them from the power and assaults of their enemies; and
   that they should fear, lest, if they should contaminate the camp, He
   would be offended with their filthiness and forsake them. The sum is,
   that when they have need of God's assistance, and are engaged in war
   against their enemies, the pursuit of holiness must not be omitted or
   neglected even in the midst of arms.

   Deuteronomy 14:1, 2

   1. Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
   yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

   1. Filii estis Jehovae Dei vestri. Non vos incidetis, nec facietis
   calvitium super mortuo.

   2. For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath
   chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations
   that are upon the earth.

   2. Quoniam populus sanctus es Jehovae Deo tuo, qui te elegit ut sis ei
   in populum peculiarem e cunctis gentibus quae sunt in superficie
   terrae.


   Deuteronomy 22:9. Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard. These four precepts,
   which all condemn strange medleys, I doubt not to be supplements of the
   First Commandment; and the reason, which is subjoined in Deuteronomy,
   directs us to this, where God declares that the produce of the seed and
   of the vineyard is polluted, if there be divers mixtures. Whence it
   appears that nothing else is demanded but that they should cultivate
   purity. The word indeed, which Moses uses, means to "sanctify," qds
   kadesh; but, by antiphrasis, it is taken for to "contaminate." To the
   same effect is what follows, that they should not plough with an ox and
   an ass together; for this diversity is forbidden on no other account,
   but because men contract some defilement as soon as they depart from
   simplicity. Yet, if any one thinks otherwise, I shall not strongly
   contend with him. It might indeed be objected, that when God forbids
   animals to be used promiscuously, so that those of different kinds
   should not be mixed together, He has regard to chastity, [30] and that,
   by forbidding the fields to be sown with divers seeds, and garments to
   be woven of divers materials, He would prevent frauds. But the more
   simple explanation is, that the people were thus retained in purity,
   lest they should accustom themselves to corrupt habits, and lest they
   should bring in strange rites from various quarters, or seek, with
   depraved curiosity, for mixtures which might at length invade the
   worship of God. For if animals of different species are joined
   together, the integrity of nature is corrupted, and an adulterine
   offspring is produced, which degenerates from the institution of God;
   but, if various kinds of seed should be mixed together, or if a garment
   should be woven of linen and wool, there would be no danger of
   deception or fraud in so manifest a matter. It is probable, therefore,
   that the end which, as I have said, was proposed by God was, that, by
   cultivating natural and simple habits all their life through, they
   should keep themselves pure and uncorrupted from every strange vice. On
   this account Scripture compares strange doctrines to leaven, since by
   their additions or curtailings they corrupt the pure word of God.
   (Matthew 16:11.) And this was by no means a useless discipline; when,
   in trifles, and almost things of nought, the rein was applied to them,
   so that they should not decline from purity in the very least degree.
   It was a small matter to interweave a thin thread with a thicker one,
   and perchance such a process would have been profitable for their
   general advantage; in some fields, too, a better crop is grown, if the
   seed is compounded of pure wheat, and some other sort of grain
   (siligine), as also the union of the horse and ass has been approved
   of, since thus mules are produced. But God would not allow these things
   amongst His ancient people, lest, sinking by degrees to greater
   license, they should at length addict themselves to the practice and
   customs of the heathen. He therefore uses this preface: "Ye shall keep
   my statutes," (Leviticus 19:19;) from whence we gather that the people
   were surrounded with fixed barriers, lest they should defile themselves
   with foreign vices, and imitate the nations, from which they had been
   separated. Wherefore this is the sum, that they should abide in God's
   statutes.

   Leviticus 19:19, 23-25, 27, 28

   19. Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender
   with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:
   neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

   19. Statuta mea observabitis. Animal tuum non facies coire cum altero
   semine. Agrum tuum non seres diverso semine, et vestis contexta ex lana
   et lino non ascendet super te.

   23. And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
   manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
   uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it
   shall not be eaten of.

   23. Quum ingressi fueritis terram, et plantaveritis omnis generis
   arborem fructiferam, tune praeputia-tum ducetis praeputium ejus,
   fructum ejus: tribus annis erit vobis incircumcisa: non comedetis ejus

   24. But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to

   24. Quarto autem anno erit omnis fructus ejus sanctitas laudum Jehovae.

   25. And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it

   25. Anno vero quinto comedetis fructum ejus, ut multiplicet vobis

   28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
   print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

   28. Incisionera pro mortuo non facietis in carne vestra, neque
   sculpturam notse tacietis in vobis: ego Jehova.


   23. And when ye shall come. There seems to me no question but that the
   circumcision of trees as well as of men appertains to the First
   Commandment, not only that the Jews might see a symbol of their own
   adoption in the very trees, but that they might learn that it was
   permitted to none but the children of God to feed on their fruit; and
   also that whatsoever the earth produces is in a manner profane, until
   it is purified. For surely by this ceremony was set forth what Paul
   teaches, that all things are "sanctified by the word of God, and
   prayer," (1 Timothy 4:5;) not that anything is in itself impure, but
   because the earth has contracted pollution from the corruption of man,
   it is just, as regards us, that the harmless fruits also should be
   accounted to be in uncircumcision. In sum, God would raise up a wall
   whereby He might separate His people from the Gentiles, and at the same
   time admonish them that a legitimate use of those things which the
   earth produced could not be made by the sons of Adam, except by special
   privilege. But the similitude of uncircumcision, until the year
   appointed for their being circumcised, was a very appropriate one, that
   they might acknowledge the fruits of their trees to be pure for them by
   the same right whereby they were consecrated as God's peculiar people.
   But, lest the three years' unproductiveness should press heavily upon
   them, he promises them compensation from the future blessing of God;
   for, if they should abstain from eating the unclean fruit, a larger
   produce was to be expected in future.

   27. Ye shall not round the corners. It clearly appears that God had no
   other object than by the interposition of this obstacle to sever His
   people from heathen nations. For there is nothing to which men are more
   prone than to conform themselves to the customs of others; and hence it
   arises, that they mutually communicate each other's vices. Wherefore
   care was especially to be taken lest the people of Israel should adopt
   foreign habits, and by this pliableness should fall away from the true
   worship of God; from whence too the ordinary phrase has arisen, that
   the word "common" should be used for "unclean." God then strictly
   forbids them from declining to the habits of the Gentiles, and
   confounding the distinction which He had Himself placed between them.
   There is no doubt but that it was usual for the Gentiles, out of
   superstition, to cut marks [31] upon their faces, to trim the hair in
   certain steps or circles, and in their mourning to lacerate their
   flesh, or to disfigure it with marks. It is well known that the priests
   of Cybele [32] made gashes in their flesh with knives and razors, and
   covered themselves all over with wounds, for the sake of shewing their
   zeal. The same thing was also commonly practiced by others; inasmuch as
   the world is easily deceived by external ceremonies. But though this
   were a thing in itself indifferent, yet God would not allow His people
   to be at liberty to practice it, that, like children, they might learn
   from these slight rudiments, that they would not be acceptable with
   God, unless they were altogether different from uncircumcised
   foreigners, and as far as possible from following their examples; and
   especially that they should avoid all ceremonies whereby their religion
   was testified. For experience teaches how greatly the true worship of
   God is obscured by anything adscititious, and how easily foul
   superstitions creep in, when the comments of men are tacked on to the
   word of God. Doubtless that part, "Ye shall not make any cuttings in
   your flesh for the dead," etc., might be expounded as a correction of
   immoderate grief; because we know how intemperately men set themselves
   against God when they give the reins to their sorrow; but since the
   object of the Gentiles was to pay what was due to the dead, and to
   celebrate their funeral obsequies [33] as a kind of propitiation, it is
   probable, and more suitable, that by the whole context those
   preposterous gestures are condemned, which were proofs of piety among
   the Gentiles, but which would have been defilements to the people of
   God.

   The same thing appears more clearly from the passage in Deuteronomy,
   which next follows, wherein Moses condemns cutting themselves, and
   making themselves bald for the dead in connection with each other, as
   if they were one thing; and confirms the law by a general argument,
   that they might withdraw themselves from every pollution as the
   children of God; since they were chosen to be His peculiar people; as
   much as to say, that God's grace would be altogether frustrated, if
   they did not differ at all from foreign nations. As to his saying that
   they were chosen out of all the nations, it does not a little
   illustrate the gratuitous mercy of God, wherewith He honored them
   alone, by calling them to the hope of eternal salvation, and passing by
   the Gentiles; for there was no nobility found in them, nor did they
   exceed others either in number or in any other superiority, on account
   of which He should prefer them to the whole world. But the design of
   Moses in magnifying the extraordinary goodness of God, was that they
   might the more abhor that impure cornmixture, which, by bringing them
   on a par with the Gentiles, degraded them from this high honor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] "Most of the barbarous nations lately discovered have their faces,
   arms:, breasts, etc., curiously carved or tattooed, probably for
   superstitious purposes. Ancient writers abound with accounts of marks
   made on the faces, arms, etc., in honor of different idols; and to this
   the inspired penman alludes, (Revelation 13:16-17; 14:9-11, etc.),
   where false worshippers are represented as receiving in their hands,
   and in their forehead, the marks of the beast. These were called
   stigmata among the Greeks, and to these St. Paul refers when he says,
   "I bear about in my body the marks (stigmata) of the Lord
   Jesus.".(Galatians 6:17} "All the castes of the Hindoos bear on their
   foreheads, or elsewhere, what are called sectarian marks, which not
   only distinguish them in a civil, but in a religious point of view,
   from each other." "Herodotus observes that the Arabs shave, or cut
   their hair round, in honor of Bacchus; (lib. 3. ch. 8). He says, also,
   that the Macians, a people of Lybia, cut their hair round, so as to
   leave a tuft on the top of the head; (lib. 4. ch. 175." "That the
   ancients were very violent in their grief, tearing the hair and face,
   beating the breast, etc., is well known. Virgil represents the sister
   of Dido: -- Unguibus ora -- foedans, et pectora pugnis. AEn. iv. 672."

   [32] The authorities for this practice of the Galli, or Priests of
   Cybele, are too numerous to mention. The following extract from a
   curious description given by Apuleius, of the religious dance of her
   worshippers, may suffice: "Die sequenti variis coloribus indusiati, et
   deformiter quisque formarti, facie coenoso pigmento delita, et oculis

   which he had been speaking, still it refers also to the doctrine before
   us, and stands in the shape of preface to it. In a word, it connects
   two things, for God here briefly declares His will, not only with
   respect to unlawful and improper intercourse, but also why He forbids
   His people to eat of unclean animals. Therefore He says, "I am the Lord
   your God, which have separated you from other people." Whence it
   follows, that for no other reason were they prohibited from eating
   those animals, except that they thence may learn to take more diligent
   heed, and to withdraw themselves far from all the pollutions of the
   Gentiles. He had before recommended purity by various symbols, and now
   extends it even to the very animals. And this reason must be carefully
   marked, that the distinction between meats is propounded to them in
   order that they may study purity. For there would be something
   unmeaning in what is here said, if we did not know that this
   interdiction was imposed with this object, that they should not mix
   themselves promiscuously with the Gentiles. Therefore it is again
   repeated, that they were severed, that they might be God's inheritance;
   and hence it is inferred, that holiness was to be cultivated by them,
   that they might conform themselves to the example of their God. Now it
   cannot be questioned, that the distinction of meats which is
   prescribed, is a supplement to the First Commandment, wherein the rule
   for worshipping God duly and purely is laid down; and thus religion is
   rescued from all admixtures of superstition.

   Leviticus 11

   Leviticus 11:1-47

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo ad eos:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts
   which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

   2. Loquimini ad filios Israel, dicendo, Haec sunt animalia quae
   comedetis ex omnibus animalibus quae sunt super terram:

   3. Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
   cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

   3. Omne dividens ungulam et findens fissuram ungularum, et ruminans
   inter animalia, illud comedetis.

   4. Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of
   them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud,
   but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

   4. Veruntamen hoc non comedetis ex his quae ruminant, et ex his quae
   dividunt ungulam, camelum, quia ruminat, et ungulam ipse non dividit:
   immundus erit vobis.

   5. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
   hoof; he is unclean unto you.

   5. Et cuniculum: quia ruminat, et ungulam non dividit, immundus erit
   vobis.

   6. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
   he is unclean unto you.

   6. Et leporem: quia ruminat, et ungulam non dividit, imnmndus erit
   vobis.

   7. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet
   he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

   7. Suem quoque: quia dividit ungulam, et findit fissuram ungulae, ipse
   vero non ruminat, immundus erit vobis.

   8. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
   touch; they are unclean to you.

   8. De carne eorum non comedetis, neque cadaver eorum tangetis: immunda
   erunt vobis.

   9. These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: Whatsoever hath
   fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them
   shall ye eat.

   9. Hoe autem comedetis ex omnibus quae sunt in aquis: onmia quibus sunt
   pinnae et squamae in aquis maris, et in fluminibus, illa comedetis.

   10. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
   rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which
   is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:

   10. Omnia vero quibus non sunt pinnae et squamae in mari, et in
   fluminibus, tam de omni reptili aquatili, quam de omni anima vivente
   quae est in aquis: abominatio erunt vobis.

   11. They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of
   their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

   11. Abominatio, inquam, erunt vobis: de carne eorum non comedetis, et
   cadaver eorum abominabimini.

   12. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an
   abomination unto you.

   12. Quicquid non habet pinnas et squamas in aquis, abominatio erit
   vobis.

   13. And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
   fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and
   the ossifrage, and the ospray,

   13. Haec autem abominabimini ex volatilibus, (non comedetur: quia
   abominatio sunt:) aquilam, et gryphum, et haliaeetum,

   14. And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

   14. Et vulturem, et milvum secundum speciem suam.

   15. Every raven after his kind;

   15. Et omnem corvum secundum speciem suam.

   16. And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
   his kind,

   16. Et filiam struthionis, et noctuam, et larum: et accipitrem secundum
   speciem suam.

   17. And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

   17. Et nycticoracem, et mergulum, et ibin,

   18. And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle,

   18. Et porphyrionem, et pellicanum, et cygnum,

   19. And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
   bat.

   19. Et ciconiam, charadrium secundum speciem suam, et upupam, et
   vespertilionem.

   20. All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination
   unto you.

   20. Omne reptile alatum ambulans super quatuor pedes, abominatio erit
   vobis.

   21. Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon
   all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the
   earth;

   21. Veruntamen hoc comedetis ex omni reptili alato quod gradietur super
   quatuor pedes, cui sunt crura super pedes suos, quibus saliant super
   terram.

   22. Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the
   bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
   grasshopper after his kind.

   22. Haec ex illis comedetis, locustam juxta speciem suam, et attacum
   juxta speciem suam, et ophiomacum secundum speciem suam, et bruchum
   secundum speciem suam.

   23. But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall
   be an abomination unto you.

   23. Omne autem reliquum reptile alatum cui sunt quatuor pedes,
   abominatio erit vobis.

   24. And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase
   of them shall be unclean until the even.

   24. Et his polluetis vos: quicunque tetigerit cadaver eorum, immundus
   erit usque ad vesperam

   25. And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his
   clothes, and be unclean until the even.

   25. Et quicunque portaverit cadavera, lavabit vestimenta sua, et
   immundus erit usque advesperam.

   26. The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
   clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that
   toucheth them shall be unclean.

   26. Omne animal quod dividit ungulam, et fissuram non findit., et non
   ruminat, immunda erunt vobis: quicunque tetigerit ea, immundus erit.

   27. And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that
   go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their
   carcase shall be unclean until the even.

   27. Et quicquid graditur super volas suas inter omnes feras quae
   gradiuntur super quatuor pedes, immunda erunt vobis: quicunque
   tetigerit cadavera eorum, immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

   28. And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and
   be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.

   28. Et qui portaverit cadavera eorum, lavabit vestimenta, immundusque
   erit usque ad vesperam: immunda erunt vobis.

   29. These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that
   creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after
   his kind,

   29. Et haec vobis immunda erunt inter reptilia quae reptant super
   terram, mustella, et mus, et rubeta secundum speciem suam.

   30. And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail,
   and the mole.

   30. Et mygale, et chameleon, et stellio, et lacerta, et talpa.

   31. These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch
   them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

   31. Ista immunda sunt vobis inter omnia reptilia: quicunque tetigerit
   illa postquam mortua fuerit, im-mundus erit usqne ad vesperam.

   32. And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it
   shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or
   skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it
   must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it
   shall be cleansed.

   32. Et omne super quod tetigerit aliquid ex eis postquam mortua
   fuerint, immudum erit, tam vas lineum quam vestis, aut pellis, aut
   saccus: omne vas in quo fieri solet opus, in aquam mittetur, et
   immundum erit usque ad vesperam, et mundabitur.

   33. And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever
   is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

   33. Omne praeterea vas testaceum intra quod occiderit aliquid ex eis,
   quicquid erit in illo immundum erit, et ipsum confringetis.

   34. Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
   shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel
   shall be unclean.

   34. Omnis cibus qui comeditur, super quem venerit aqua, immundus erit,
   et omnis potus qui potatur in omni vase impuro, immundus erit.

   35. And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall
   be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be
   broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.

   35. Et omne super quo ceciderit quicquam de cadavere eorum, imundum
   erit: clibanus et chytropodes diruentur, immunda sunt, et immunda erunt
   vobis.

   36. Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water,
   shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

   36. Veruntamen fons et cisterna congregationis aquarum erit munda: at
   quod tetigerit cadaver eorum, immundum erit.

   37. And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing-seed which is
   to be sown, it shall be clean.

   37. Praeterea si ceciderit quicquam de cadavere eorum super aliquod
   semen satum, quod seminabitur, mundum erit.

   38. But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
   carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

   38. At quum fusa fuerit aqua super semen, et ceciderit quicquam de
   cadavere eorum super illud, immundum erit vobis.

   39. And if any beast of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
   carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

   39. Quum autem mortuum fuerit aliquod animal quod sit vobis in cibum,
   qui tetigerit cadaver ejus, immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

   40. And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and
   be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall
   wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

   40. Et qui comederit de cadavere ejus, lavabit vestimenta sua,
   immundusque erit usque ad vesperam: is quoque qui extulerit cadaver,
   lavabit vestimenta sua, atque immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

   41. And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an
   abomination; it shall not be eaten.

   41. Et omne reptile reptans super terram, abominatio est, non
   comedetur.

   42. Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
   four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep
   upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.

   42. Quicquid item graditur super pectus, et quicquid incedit super
   quatuor aut plures pedes inter omnia reptilia quae reptant super
   terram, non comedetis: quia abominatio sunt.

   43. Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
   that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that
   ye should be defiled thereby.

   43. Ne impuras reddatis animas vestras in omni reptili quod reptat, nec
   polluatis vos in eis, neque coinquinetis vos per ea.

   44. For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
   and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves
   with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

   44. Quia ego Jehova Deus vester, sanctificate ergo vos, et estote
   sancti, quia sanctus sum: et ne polluatis animas vestras per aliqua
   reptilia quae reptant super terram.

   45. For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to
   be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

   45. Ego enim sum Jehova, qui eduxi vos e terra AEgypti, ut essem vobis
   in Deum, et essetis sancti, quia sanctus sum.

   46. This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living
   creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth
   upon the earth:

   46. Haec est lex animalium terrestrium, et volatilium, atque omnium
   animalium viventium qae reptant, et omnium animantium reptantium super
   terram.

   47. To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between
   the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

   47. Ad distinguendum inter immundum et mundum, et inter bestias qum
   comedi possunt, et bestias qum comedi non possunt.


   2. These are the beasts which ye shall eat. The holy fathers, before
   the birth of Moses, knew what animals were unclean; of which fact Noah
   afforded a manifest proof, when, by God's command, he took into the ark
   seven pairs of the clean animals, and offered of them his sacrifice of
   thanksgiving to God. Certainly he could not have obeyed the command of
   God, unless he had either been taught by secret inspiration, or unless
   this tradition had descended to him from his forefathers. But there is
   nothing absurd in the notion that God, desiring to confirm the
   traditional distinction, appointed certain marks of difference whereby
   its observation might be more scrupulously attended to, and lest any
   transgression of it should creep in through ignorance. For God also
   consecrated the Sabbath to Himself from the creation of the world, and
   desired it to be observed by the people before the promulgation of the
   Law; and yet afterwards the peculiar holiness of the day was more
   distinctly expressed. Besides, the clean animals are here distinguished
   from the unclean, by name as well as by signs. The proper names, which
   are recited, are of little service to us now-a-days; because many
   species which are common in the East, are unknown elsewhere; and it was
   therefore easy for Jews [35] who were born and had lived in distant
   countries, to fall into error about them; whilst, on the other hand,
   the more bold they are in their conjectures, the less are they to be
   trusted. As to many of them, I acknowledge that there is no ambiguity,
   especially as to the tame animals, or those that are to be found
   everywhere, or that have plain descriptions of them given in the Bible.
   A positive knowledge then is only to be sought from the signs which are
   here laid down; viz., that the animals which have cloven hoofs, and
   which ruminate, are clean: and that those are unclean in which either
   of these two things is wanting; that either sea or river fish, which
   have fins and scales, are clean. No such distinction as to birds is
   given, but only the unclean are named, which it was sinful to eat.
   Lastly, mention is made of reptiles. As to details, if there be
   anything worthy of observation, the place to consider them will be
   further on; let us now remember, in general, what I have before touched
   upon, viz., that whilst the Gentiles might eat every kind of food, many
   were forbidden to the Jews, in order that they might learn in their
   very food to cultivate purity; and this was the object of their
   separation from ordinary customs. Hence it arose that they use the word
   chll, chalal [36] both for "to make common," and to "contaminate;" and
   the word, chvl, chol, signifies "polluted," because it is opposed to
   anything holy or set apart. It is true, indeed, that the Gentiles, by
   natural instinct, have regarded with the utmost horror the eating of
   some of the animals which are here forbidden; still, God would surround
   His people with barriers, which must separate them from their
   neighbors.

   Those who imagine that God here had regard to their health, as if
   discharging the office of a Physician, pervert by their vain
   speculation the whole force and utility of this law. I allow, indeed,
   that the meats which God permits to be eaten are wholesome, and best
   adapted for food; but, both from the preface, -- in which God
   admonished them that holiness was to be cultivated by the people whom
   He had chosen, -- as also from the (subsequent) abolition of this law,
   it is sufficiently plain that this distinction of meats was a part of
   that elementary instruction [37] under which God kept His ancient
   people.

   "Let no man therefore judge you (says Paul) in meat or in drink, which
   are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." (Colossians
   2:16-17.)

   By which expressions he means, that what was spiritual had been
   shadowed forth in the external rite of abstaining from meats. To the
   same effect he elsewhere says, (Romans 14:14) that he knows and is
   persuaded, [38] that in the Lord Jesus Christ there is nothing unclean;
   viz., because Christ by his death has redeemed His people from slavish
   subjection. Hence it follows, that the prohibition of meats must be
   counted among the ceremonies, which were exercises in the worship of
   God. But here a question arises, how it is reconcilable that, even from
   the days of Noah, certain animals were unclean, and yet that all
   without exception were allowed to be eaten? I cannot agree with some in
   thinking that the distinction originally made by God grew obsolete by
   degrees; for God, in excepting the eating of blood only, makes a grant
   of whatsoever moves upon the earth as the food of the posterity of
   Noah. I therefore restrict to the sacrifices that uncleanness, with the
   knowledge of which the hearts of the Patriarchs were then inspired, nor
   do I doubt but that it was as lawful for Abraham, as well as for them,
   to eat swine's flesh as the flesh of oxen. Afterwards, when God imposed
   the yoke of the Law to repress the licentiousness of the people, He
   somewhat curtailed this general permission, not because He repented of
   His liberality; but because it was useful to compel in this way to
   obedience these almost rude and uncivilized people. But, since before
   the Law the condition of the saints was the same as our own, it must be
   remembered, as I said before, that, agreeably to the dictates of
   nature, they spontaneously avoided certain foods, just as at present no
   one will hunt wolves or lions for food, nor desire to eat serpents and
   other venomous animals. But the object of this ordinance was different,
   viz., lest they who were God's sacred and peculiar people, should
   freely and promiscuously communicate with the Gentiles.

   3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof. Whilst I fear that but little confidence
   can be placed in the allegories, in which many have taken delight; so I
   do not find any fault with, nor even refuse that which has been handed
   down from the ancients, [39] viz., that by the cleaving of the hoof is
   signified prudence in distinguishing the mysteries of Scripture, and by
   the chewing of the cud serious meditation on its heavenly doctrines;
   although I cannot approve of the subtlety [40] which they add, viz.,
   that those "rightly divide the word" who have known how to elicit
   mystical senses from its letter; because hence it has come to pass that
   they have allowed themselves in all sorts of imaginations. I therefore
   embrace the more simple notion, that they who only have a taste for the
   carnal sense, do not divide the hoof; for, as Paul says, only "he that
   is spiritual discerneth all things." (1 Corinthians 2:15, margin.) The
   chewing of the cud ought to follow, duly to prepare and digest the
   spiritual food; for many gulp down Scripture without profit, because
   they neither sincerely desire to profit by it, nor seek to refresh
   their souls by it, as their nourishment; but satisfied with the empty
   delights of knowledge, make no efforts to conform their life to it. In
   the first clause, then, brutal stupidity is condemned; in the other,
   the ambition and levity of curious men. [41] God, indeed, set before
   Peter, in the vision, unclean animals as images and figures of the
   Gentiles, (Acts 10:12;) and therefore it is lawful, by probable
   analogy, to transfer to men what is said about the animals. But why God
   should have appointed the cloven hoof and rumination as signs, is no
   more clear to me than why He should have forbidden their eating swine's
   flesh; unless, perchance, because the solid hoof is a sign of wildness;
   whilst the animals which do not ruminate feed for the most part on
   filth and excrement. We know that on this point there was much
   contention immediately after the promulgation of the Gospel, because
   some of the Jews, in their excessive devotion to the Law, and
   considering that the distinction of meats was not to be reckoned among
   the, ceremonial enactments, desired that the new Church should be bound
   by the same trammels as had been imposed upon the ancient people. At
   length, by the decree of the Apostles, permission was given to the
   Gentiles to eat all kinds of meat, except only blood and things
   strangled, and that only for a time, for the sake of avoiding offense,
   since the Jews would not otherwise have been propitiated. Now, after
   what God Himself had ordained respecting the distinction of meats had
   been abrogated, it was an act of diabolical audacity to oblige men's
   consciences by human laws, and to prevent them from enjoying the
   liberty obtained by Christ.

   Another question remains, how God should pronounce anything which He
   has created to be unclean; for, if an animal be rejected on account of
   its uncleanness, part of the reproach redounds to the Author Himself.
   Besides, this rejection seems also to be opposed to the first
   declaration of God, when, considering all things which He had made, He
   acknowledged them to be "very good." The solution is, that no animal
   was ever unclean in itself; but that this merely refers to its use.
   Thus in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there was naturally
   neither fault nor harm, so that it should infect man by its pollution,
   yet he contracted death from it on account of God's prohibition.
   Wherefore, also, in this passage, God does not condemn His work in the
   animals, but, as to their being eaten, He would have them accounted
   unclean, that the people may abominate that which is forbidden them. In
   a word, it is only transgression which defiles: for the animals have
   never changed their nature; but it was in God's power to determine what
   He would have to be lawful or unlawful. Thus another objection is
   removed. Christ declares that

   "not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man "
   (Matthew 10:11.)

   If any one should thence infer that harmless animals are improperly
   condemned, we must reply that they are not accounted unclean in
   themselves, but that the prohibition had a different object. For that
   doctrine was always true, that

   "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,"
   (Romans 14:17;)

   but, when God forbade the Israelites to eat this or that kind of food,
   they were admonished by this ceremonial precept how abominable is the
   inward corruption of the heart. But by such elementary teaching they
   were prepared and led onwards to spiritual doctrine, that they might
   know that nothing defiles a man except what comes out of his mouth.
   Now-a-days the condition of believers is different. for liberty is
   obtained for them, since Christ, having abrogated the Law, has nailed

   "the handwriting of ordinances to his cross."
   (Colossians 2:14.)

   4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of. He more clearly expresses
   what he had previously glanced at, viz., that an animal, although it
   may ruminate, shall not be clean unless it also cleaves the hoof; and,
   on the other hand, that the cloven hoof will not be sufficient unless
   combined with rumination. In these words Moses taught that partial and
   imperfect purity must not be obtruded upon God. If any choose to think
   that rumination is the symbol of internal purity, and the cloven hoof
   of external, his opinion will be a probable one. Since this distinction
   has occurred to my mind, although I have no taste for subtle
   speculations, I have thought it well to mention it, yet leaving it free
   for any one to accept it or not. Meanwhile we must hold it as certain,
   as I have lately said, that God demands perfect cleanliness, undefiled
   by any admixture. But the prohibition was most onerous to the Jews with
   respect to swine's flesh, because it is very well adapted for food, not
   only as being a pleasant accompaniment of other meats, but because the
   working-classes are fed upon it at a smaller cost. In this point,
   therefore, the religion of the Jewish people was especially proved.
   For, when the soldiers of Antiochus desired to force the people to an
   entire renunciation of the Law, they only urged them to eat swine's
   flesh [42] And hence the famous witticism of Augustus, "I would rather
   be Herod's pig than his son;" [43] because, whilst he abstained from
   pork, he was the murderer of his children. But, in order that the Jews
   might observe this prohibition more strictly, the very touch was also
   forbidden them; so that it was not only wicked to taste swine's flesh,
   but even to touch it with their hands after the animal was killed. The
   same rule did not apply to beef or mutton; for it is necessary to
   handle the meat which is appointed for our food.

   9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters. Here, also, some
   who know little of religion, plausibly contend that God is acting the
   physician's part, and distinguishing wholesome from unwholesome food.
   But although their opinion is sufficiently refuted by medical men
   themselves, yet, even if I should admit what they desire, they reason
   badly. For the purpose of God was other than to provide for the
   people's health; and, because He had to do with a rude people, He chose
   common marks, being admonished by which they might gradually ascend to
   higher things. It would be useless to follow the allegories which
   Isychius has invented [44] and I would willingly bury in oblivion these
   triflings, except that many have such a leaning to subtleties, that
   sober views would scarcely please them, until the folly of these
   allegories shall have been convicted. I will say nothing of the scales
   and fins. If at first sight any should approve of what he says as to
   the names of the fish being omitted, because the Church seeks not. a
   name upon earth, and that the Church is signified by the fish, -- let
   them consider whether it is consistent that the Church should only
   exist in the water; and, again, that the birds, which are nearer
   heaven, should be excluded from this honor; thirdly, that the clean
   animals should be rejected, as if they did not belong to the Church;
   lastly, that those who by their contagion pollute the Church should be
   counted amongst the elect, whose names are written in heaven; for
   certainly many of the fish are unclean. Those who will not acquiesce in
   these perspicuous reasons, I will allow to wander in their labyrinth.
   This simple view will satisfy the moderate and teachable, that the fish
   are not named, because the greater part of them were unknown to the
   Jews, whose country did not produce many of the river-fish, since it
   scarcely had any river besides the Jordan, whilst the sea-fish only
   visited the neighboring shores.

   13. And these are they which ye shall have in abomination. The species
   of birds and reptiles which are forbidden, are such as common feeling
   almost naturally repudiates. And assuredly God dealt with great
   indulgence towards His people, so as not to weigh them down with too
   heavy burdens. But because man's greediness sometimes delights in
   monstrous food, He desired even in minor matters to put the rein upon
   them, lest they should rush with heathen nations into intemperance,
   whereby they would be polluted. For there was danger lest, by devouring
   filthy animals, they should harden themselves to join in various other
   corruptions. Another law is added, that they should not only abstain
   from eating these unclean animals, but, if any such should be killed,
   that they should not defile themselves by touching its carcase; nay,
   that if any vessels should have come in contact with them, those made
   of earth should be broken, and others should be washed. It seems to be
   a trifling matter to enjoin, that if a mouse should have been drowned
   in a vessel of water, the vessel itself should be unclean; and the
   strictness appears excessive, that the Jews should be commanded, [45]
   if any such animal had fallen into a vessel of wine, and had died
   there, not only to pour away the wine, but also to destroy the vessel;
   and if it had been smothered in an oven, or had lain in the hearth, to
   break down both of them; as if spiritual infection reached even to
   things without life. But we must always consider the intention of God:
   from whence we shall learn that He was not so severe and exacting in
   unimportant things as to tie His people to the observation of
   (superfluous) [46] matters; but that these were acts of discipline
   whereby He might accustom them to study purity, which is so generally
   neglected and omitted among men. Now-a-days, also, we are commanded by
   the mouth of Paul,

   "whether we eat, or drink, or whatsoever we do, to do all to the glory
   of God," (1 Corinthians 10:31;)

   but in this respect we differ from the ancient people, that, being
   delivered from childish rudiments, we are directed only to what is
   spiritual, viz., that meat and drink are supplied to us by God, that we
   may serve in purity the Author of our life. But it was necessary to
   stimulate the Jews in various ways that they might be more attentive to
   this object; whilst God commanded them to keep their houses free from
   all uncleanness, and to be diligent in watching over the purity of
   their water, and all their vessels; that He might constantly set before
   their eyes how diligently He would have them to labor after true
   cleanliness; as follows in the end of the chapter.

   43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable. He does not invite them to
   take care of their health, nor warn them of the danger of contracting'
   diseases, but bids them beware of defiling themselves. And a clearer
   explanation is subjoined, "For I am the Lord your God: ye shall
   therefore sanctify yourselves; for I am holy." Lest they should imagine
   that the main part of religion was contained in external ceremonies,
   they were to consider the nature of God; for, inasmuch as He is a
   Spirit, He would be worshipped only spiritually. Thus holiness is only
   connected instrumentally with the distinction of meats; since their
   abstinence had no other object than that they should consecrate
   themselves to God. Therefore the superstition of the Jews was
   inexcusable, when they satisfied themselves with trifling observances;
   [47] as if one should learn the letters of the alphabet without
   applying them to their use, and reading what is written. From their
   example we perceive how eagerly men lay hold of everything they can to
   sustain them in their hypocrisy, for they not only wrested to their
   earthly notions the things which were profitable in the pursuit of true
   integrity of heart; but, not content, with this, they heaped to
   themselves many supererogatory rites; [48] hence the water of
   expiation, or lustration always in use, even when they were unconscious
   of any pollution: hence their anxious labor in washing cups and
   platters, that it might readily appear how constantly the perversity of
   man abuses what God has appointed for the best of reasons.

   15. And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which

   his iniquity.

   16. Quod si non laverit vestes, et carnem non laverit, portabit
   iniquitatem suam.


   Deuteronomy 14:21. Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself.
   The eating of any carcase, or of flesh torn by wild beasts, is reckoned
   among the causes of defilement; but we must understand it to be the
   carcase of an animal which has died of hunger or disease, for, from the
   nature of its death, it contracted impurity, although in itself it were
   otherwise pure. The end of the precept is gathered from the reason
   which is immediately subjoined, "for thou art a holy people unto the
   Lord thy God," and from the ablution which is prescribed in the passage
   from Leviticus. The same thing is, secondly, enjoined respecting flesh
   that has been torn, as before with regard to the carcase, for the
   deformity of its laceration is counted as uncleanness. The holiness of
   the people is again referred to, that they may more diligently beware
   of defilements. Hence it follows that those were contaminated who
   should eat of torn flesh. Therefore, in the third passage, he confirms
   it that the Jews were to abstain, and were prohibited from the eating
   of a carcase or the flesh of an animal torn by beasts, lest they should
   pollute themselves. Nor is it an objection that the eating of carrion
   and of blood are here prohibited in conjunction with each other; for we
   know that Moses does not always arrange his precepts in order, but
   promiscuously adduces such as appertain to different classes.
   Therefore, I have thought it well to separate these two prohibitions
   which have distinct objects, and whose dissimilarity manifestly appears
   from the difference of their punishment. He who shall have eaten blood
   shall be cut off from the people; whereas he who shall have eaten
   carrion, shall wash himself and be unclean till the evening. A question
   might again arise respecting torn or lacerated flesh; but it seems in
   my judgment to be plain enough from the context, that flesh torn by
   beasts is counted amongst unclean meats; for the reason of the law is
   expressed, viz., because those who were chosen to be a holy people
   should keep themselves pure and incorrupt. Nor would God command that
   meat intended for man should be thrown to dogs, unless it were infected
   with a contagion, which would pollute His holy ones. As to the command,
   in the first passage, to give it to a stranger, or to sell it to an
   alien, that he might eat it, it does not appear reasonable, since that
   would be to supply the materials for sin, as though one should offer a
   sword to a madman, or transfer illicit goods to others. But the
   solution of this difficulty is easy: for the Gentiles were permitted to
   eat indifferently of all sorts of food, since no distinctions were
   placed between them; but the prohibition of certain meats was a mark of
   separation between them and the elect people of God. A more difficult
   question arises from a kind of contradiction, because Moses in another
   passage binds both the stranger and the home-born by the same law, and
   declares them to be alike unclean if they shall have tasted of carrion.
   But we must bear in mind that he sometimes calls those strangers who,
   although born of heathen parents, had embraced the Law. Circumcision,
   therefore, connected them with God, just as if they had derived their
   origin from Abraham; whilst there were other strangers, whom
   uncircumcision separated from the children of Abraham as profane and
   excomnmnicate. The sum is, that whosoever allege God's name, and boast
   themselves to be His people, are called to cultivate holiness, and to
   keep themselves pure from every stain.

   Deuteronomy 21

   Deuteronomy 21:10-13

   10. When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD
   thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them
   captive,

   10. Quum egressus fueris ad bellum contra inimicos tuos, et dederit eos
   Jehova Deus tuus in manum tuam, et ex eis captivos abduxeris:

   11. And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire
   unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

   11. Videris autem in captivitate mulierem pulchram forma, et deamaris
   eam, et acceperis tibi in uxorem.

   12. Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave
   her head, and pare her nails;

   12. Introduces eam domum tuam: et radet caput suum, ac praecidet ungues
   suos:

   13. And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and
   shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a
   full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her
   husband, and she shall be thy wife.

   13. Deponetque vestimentum captivitatis suae a se, et manebit in domo
   tua, ae flebit patrem suum, et matrem suam mensem integrum: et postea
   ingredieris ad eam, erisque maritus ejus, et erit tibi uxor.


   10. When thou goest forth to war. The same thing is now commanded
   respecting wives as above respecting meats. As regarded the Canaanites,
   who were destined and devoted to destruction, we have seen that the
   Israelites were prohibited from taking their women to wife, lest this
   connection should be an enticement to sin; but Moses now goes further,
   viz., that the Israelites, having obtained a victory over other
   nations, should not marry any of the captive women, unless purified by
   a solemn rite. This, then, is the sum, that the Israelites should not
   defile themselves by profane marriages, but in this point also should
   keep themselves pure and uncorrupt, because they were separated from
   other people, to be the peculiar people of God. It was better, indeed,
   that they should altogether abstain from such marriages; yet it was
   difficult so to restrain their lust as that they should not decline
   from chastity in the least, degree; and hence we learn how much license
   conquerors allow themselves in war, so that there is no room for
   perfect purity in them. Wherefore God so tempers His indulgence as that
   the Israelites, remembering the adoption wherewith He had honored them,
   should not disgrace themselves, but in the very fervor of their lust
   should retain some religious affection. But the question here is not of
   unlawful ravishment, but Moses only speaks of women who have been made
   captives by the right of war, for we know that conquerors have abused
   them with impunity, because they had them under their power and
   dominion. But since many are led astray by the blandishments of their
   wives, God applies a remedy, viz., that the abjuration of their former
   life should precede their marriage; and that none should be allowed to
   marry a foreign wife until she shall have first renounced her own
   nation. To this refers the ceremony, that the woman should shave her
   head, and cut her nails, and change her garments, and lament her father
   and her family for an entire month, viz., that she may renounce her
   former life, and pass over to another people. Some of the rabbins twist
   the words to a different meaning, as if God would extinguish love in
   the minds of the husbands by disfiguring the women; for the shaving of
   the head greatly detracts from female beauty and elegance; and "to make
   the nails," for so the words literally mean, they understand as to let
   them grow; and the prolongation of the nails has a disgusting
   appearance. But their gloss is refuted by the context, in which she is
   commanded to put off the raiment of her captivity.: But I have no doubt
   but that their month of mourning, their shaven head, and the other
   signs, are intended by God for their renewal, so that they may accustom
   themselves to different habits. And with the same object they are
   commanded to bewail their parents as if dead, that they may bid
   farewell to their own people. To this the Prophet seems to allude in
   Psalm 45:10, when he says, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
   incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's
   house;" for he intimates that otherwise the marriage of a foreign woman
   with Solomon would not be pure and legitimate, unless she should
   relinquish her superstitions, and devote herself to God's service. Nor
   was it needless that God should require the Israelites diligently to
   beware lest they should take wives as yet aliens from the study of true
   religion, since experience most abundantly shows how fatal a snare it
   is. But although we are not now bound to this observance, yet the rule
   still holds good that men should not rashly ally themselves with women
   still devoted to wicked superstitions. [51]

   Thus far I have reviewed The Supplements To The First Commandment,
   which relate to the Ancient Types and Legal Worship. The Commandment
   itself will always remain in force, even to the end of the world; and
   is given not only to the Jews, but likewise to us also. But God
   formerly made use of the ceremonies as temporary aids, of which,
   although the use has ceased, the utility still remains; because from
   them it more clearly appears how God is to be duly served; and the
   spirit of religion shines forth in them. Therefore the whole substance
   is contained in the precept, but in the external exercise, as it were,
   the form to which God bound none but His ancient people. Now follow The
   Political Supplements^, [52] whereby God commands the punishments to be
   inflicted, if His religion shall have been violated. For political laws
   are not only enacted with reference to earthly affairs, in order that
   men should maintain mutual equity with each other, and should follow
   and observe what is right, but that they should exercise themselves in
   the veneration of God. For Plato also begins from hence, when he lays
   down the legitimate constitution of a republic, and calls the fear of
   God the preface of all laws; nor has any profane author ever existed
   who has not confessed that this is the principal part of a
   well-constituted state, that all with one consent should reverence and
   worship God. In this respect, indeed, the wisdom of men was at fault,
   that they deemed that any religion which they might prefer was to be
   sanctioned by laws and by punishments; yet the principle was a just
   one, that the whole system of law is perverted if the cultivation of
   piety is ignored by it.

   But, whilst God commends the care and study of religion to the judge,
   and commands that the contempt of it should be publicly avenged, He at
   the same time provides against a common error, that they should not
   rush into severity with rash and inconsiderate zeal. For, inasmuch as
   the several nations, cities, and kingdoms foolishly invent their own
   gods, He propounds His own Law, from the regulation of which it is
   sinful to decline. It has been wisely forbidden by human legislators,
   that men should make to themselves private gods; but all this is vain
   unless the knowledge of the true God enlightens and directs them.
   Justly, therefore, does God recall His people to that doctrine which He
   has delivered, to the end that whosoever shall have contumaciously
   despised it should be punished. But, since it would be insufficient
   that they should be once instructed in the proper worship of God by a
   written law, unless daily preaching were subjoined, God expressly
   furnishes His prophets with authority, and denounces the punishment to
   be inflicted if any should violate it. He had previously said that He
   would raise up prophets, that the condition of His chosen people should
   not be worse than that of other nations; since, therefore, He had
   deposited with them the treasure of true religion, that they might be,
   as it were, its guardians, He now threatens with destruction whosoever
   shall refuse to obey their commands. It is plain, however, from the
   expression "in my name," that He does not speak of all who may usurp
   the name of prophet, for it is as much as to say that they came from
   Him, and advanced nothing without His command. For, although many may
   falsely present themselves in God's name, this honorable distinction
   does not belong to them unless God should ratify it; but this is truly
   the characteristic of faithful and approved teachers, that they speak
   in the name of God. Thus, when Christ promises that

   "where two or three are gathered in His name, there is He in the midst
   of them," (Matthew 18:20,)

   He does not dignify with such great honor hypocrites, who with
   sacrilegious audacity usurp His name; but He speaks of the reality, as
   will also appear more clearly from the reverse law, which follows.

   Deuteronomy 13

   Deuteronomy 13:5

   5. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
   because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which
   brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house
   of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God
   commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the
   midst of thee.

   5. Propheta antem falsus aut somniator interficietur, eo quod
   defectionem loquutus sit contra Jehovam Deum vestrum, qui eduxit tee e
   terra AEgypti, et redemit tee domo servorum, ut te depelleret a via
   quam princaepit tibi Jehova Deus tuus, ut ambules in ea: et
   exterminabit malam e medio tui.


   5. And that prophet. Since the ministers of Satan deceive men by their
   plausible exterior, when they vaunt themselves to be the prophets of
   God, Moses had already admonished them, that all. teachers were not to
   be listened to indifferently, but that the true were to be
   distinguished from the false, and that, after judgment had, those
   should obtain credit who deserved it. He now subjoins the punishment of
   such as should creep in under the name of a prophet to draw away the
   people into rebellion. For he does not condemn to capital punishment
   those who may have spread false doctrine, only on account of some
   particular or trifling error, but those who are the authors of
   apostasy, and so who pluck up religion by the roots. Observe, again,
   that the season of this severity would not be until a positive religion
   should be established; and, therefore, the grossness of the impiety is
   expressly named, "if they should have tried to turn the people away
   from the worship of the true God." Moreover, that all excuse might be
   obviated, Moses says that it is sufficiently manifested who God is, and
   how He is to be worshipped, both by the wonderful blessing of their
   redemption, as well as by the doctrine of the Law. Therefore, in order
   that God may shew that so heavy a punishment is justly inflicted upon
   apostates, He declares the certainty of that religion which should
   exist among the Israelites; as much as to say, that no pardon could be
   granted to such impious contempt, since God had abundantly proved the
   glory of His Godhead by the miracle of their redemption, and had
   manifested His will in the Law.

   It must then be remembered, that the crime of impiety would not
   otherwise merit punishment, unless the religion had not only been
   received by public consent and the suffrages of the people, but, being
   supported also by sure and indisputable proofs, should place its truth
   above the reach of doubt. Thus, whilst their severity is preposterous
   who defend superstitions with the sword, so also in a well constituted
   polity, profane men are by no means to be tolerated, by whom religion
   is subverted. [53] Thus they are unable to endure, who desire to be at
   liberty to make disturbances with impunity; and therefore they call
   those sanguinary who teach that the errors by which religion is
   undermined and thence destroyed, should be restrained by public
   authority. But what will they gain by openly raving against God? God
   commands the false prophets to be put to death, who pluck up the
   foundations of religion, and are the authors and leaders of rebellion.
   Some scoundrel or other gainsays this, and sets himself against the
   author of life and death. What insolence is this! [54] As to their
   denial that the truth of God stands in need of such support, it is very
   true; but what is the meaning of this madness, in imposing a law upon
   God, that He should not make use of the obedience of magistrates in
   this respect? And what avails it to question about the necessity of
   this, since so it pleases God? God might, indeed, do without the
   assistance of the sword in defending religion; but such is not His
   will. And what wonder if God should command magistrates to be the
   avengers of His glory, when He neither wills nor suffers that thefts,
   fornications, and drunkenness should be exempt from punishment. In
   minor offenses it shall not be lawful for the judge to hesitate; and
   when the worship of God and the whole of religion is violated, shall so
   great a crime be fostered by his dissimulation? Capital punishment
   shall be decreed against adulterers; but shall the despisers of God be
   permitted with impunity to adulterate the doctrines of salvation, and
   to draw away wretched souls from the faith? Pardon shall never be
   extended to poisoners, by whom the body alone is injured; and shall it
   be sport to deliver souls to eternal destruction? Finally, the
   magistracy, if its own authority be assailed, shall take severe
   vengeance upon that contempt; and shall it suffer the profanation of
   God's holy name to be unavenged? What can be more monstrous! But it is
   superfluous to contend by argument, when God has once pronounced what
   is His will, for we must needs abide by His inviolable decree

   But it is questioned whether the law pertains to the kingdom of Christ,
   which is spiritual and distinct from all earthly dominion; and there
   are some men, not otherwise ill-disposed, to whom it appears that our
   condition under the Gospel is different from that of the ancient people
   under the law; not only because the kingdom of Christ is not of this
   world, but because Christ was unwilling that the beginnings of His
   kingdom should be aided by the sword. But, when human judges consecrate
   their work to the promotion of Christ's kingdom, I deny that on that
   account its nature is changed. For, although it was Christ's will that
   His Gospel should be proclaimed by His disciples in opposition to the
   power of the whole world, and He exposed them armed with the Word alone
   like sheep amongst wolves, He did not impose on Himself an eternal law
   that He should never bring kings under His subjection, nor tame their
   violence, nor change them from being cruel persecutors into the patrons
   and guardians of His Church. Magistrates at first exercised tyranny
   against the Church, because the time had not yet come when they should
   "kiss the Son" of God, and, laying aside their violence, should become
   the nursing fathers of the Church, which they had assailed according to
   Isaiah's prophecy, that undoubtedly refers to the coming of Christ.
   (Isaiah 49:6-23.) Nor was it causelessly that Paul, when he enjoins
   prayers to be made for kings and other worldly rulers, added the reason
   that under them

   "we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
   in all godliness and honesty." (1 Timothy 2:2.)

   Christ, indeed as He is meek, would also, I confess, have us to be
   imitators of His gentleness, but that does not prevent pious
   magistrates from providing for the tranquillity and safety of the
   Church by their defense of godliness; since to neglect this part of
   their duty, would be the greatest perfidy and cruelty. And assuredly
   nothing can be more base than, when we see wretched souls drawn away to
   eternal destruction by reason of the impunity conceded to impious,
   wicked, and perverse impostors, to count the salvation of those souls
   for nothing. But, if under this pretext the superstitious have dared to
   shed innocent blood, I reply that what God has once commanded must not
   be brought to nought on account of any abuse or corruption of men. For,
   if the cause alone abundantly distinguishes the martyrs of Christ from
   malefactors, though their punishment may be identical, so the Papal
   executioners will not bring it to pass by their unjust cruelty that the
   zeal of pious magistrates in punishing false and noxious teachers
   should be otherwise than pleasing to God. And this is admirably
   expressed in the words of Moses, when he reminds them that judgment
   must be passed according to the law of God. I have already said that.
   this severity must not be extended to particular errors, but where
   impiety breaks forth even into rebellion. When it is added, "to thrust
   thee out of the way, which the Lord thy God commanded thee," we gather
   from it that none are to be given over to punishment, but those who
   shall have been convicted by the plain word of God, lest men should
   judge them arbitrarily. Whence it also appears that zeal will err in
   hastily drawing the sword, unless a lawful examination shall have been
   previously instituted.

   [53] It is impossible not to be here reminded of Calvin's acquiescence
   in the punishment of Servetus. In the principle he lays down, we have,
   as it were, his final apology for the part he took in that matter. Any
   discussion of the much-vexed question would here be out of place, but
   it may not be altogether amiss to introduce the few following calm
   reflections from the pen of a very able modern historian, M. de Felice
   -- "1. Servetus was not an ordinary heretic; he was audaciously
   Pantheistic, and outraged the doctrine of all the great Christian
   communions, by saying that God in three persons was a Cerberus -- a
   monster with three heads. 2. He had already been condemned to death by
   the (Roman) Catholic Doctors at Vienna in Dauphine. 3. The matter was
   adjudicated, not by Calvin, but by the magistrates of Geneva; and, if
   it be objected that his opinion must have influenced their decision, it
   must be remembered that the Councils of the other Reformed Cantons of
   Switzerland unanimously approved of the sentence. 4. It was of supreme
   importance that the Reformation should clearly separate its cause from
   that of an Infidel like Servetus. The (Roman) Catholic Church, which
   now-a-days accuses Calvin of having participated in his condemnation,
   would, in the sixteenth century, have much more harshly accused him, if
   he had sought for his acquittal." -- Hist, des Protestants de France.

   Deuteronomy 17

   Deuteronomy 17:12, 13

   12. And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto
   the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or
   unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the
   evil from Israel.

   12. Vir autem qui egerit in superbia ut non audiat sacerdotem qui stat
   ut illic ministret Jehovae Deo, tuo, aut judicem, morietur vir ille, et
   exterminabis malum ex Israele

   13. And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
   presumptuously.

   13. Atque omnes e populo audi ant, ut timeant, neque in posterurn
   superbiant.


   He pronounces a similar punishment on those who shall have
   contumaciously rejected the judgment of the priests. We have already
   seen that the prophetical office was united with the priesthood; since,
   according to Malachi 2:4, the covenant of God was with Levi, that his
   descendants might be the guardians of His knowledge, and the
   interpreters of His law: yet God often punished the laxity of the
   priests, by setting other teachers over his people. At any rate, both
   were ambassadors for Him. Since, therefore, the authority of the
   prophets had been sanctioned above, the same rights are now conferred
   upon the priests; nor is this surprising, for it was no trifling crime
   to despise God, the appointer of this order. Yet we must remember what
   I have elsewhere stated, that the priests were not armed with
   tyrannical authority, so that it was sinful to reject whatever they
   might have decreed according to their own fancy. For neither did God
   dethrone Himself when He appointed them, nor did He bind men's
   consciences to obey their ordinances without distinction, but only
   would put reins on the audacity of those who have no scruple in
   undervaluing the government of the Church. For this must be considered,
   that foul and horrible would be the disorder, if men were promiscuously
   permitted to reject whatever the rulers of the Church may have
   appointed; and it would be ridiculous that persons should be called to
   govern, to whom no dignity should be accorded; and, therefore, natural
   reason itself shews and dictates, that the reverence, which is here
   demanded, is due to all lawful commands. God was the author of the
   priesthood: He, too, ordained judges. What could be more absurd than
   that they should be despised and laughed at with impunity, who presided
   in the name and by the command of God? But He has never exalted a
   mortal man so high as to abdicate His own rights; nay, it was often
   necessary boldly to reject what the priests had commanded. Urijah the
   priest built a profane altar in the fashion of that at Damascus, which
   Ahaz had sent, and offered a sacrifice thereon, [55] (2 Kings 16:12,)
   was it necessary that Isaiah should acquiesce in this? Nay, detestable
   was the adulation of all who assented to the decree of a wicked and
   perfidious priest. Moreover, we see that the prophets were very often
   so far from agreeing with the priests, that they waged open war with
   them. But the whole of this matter is decided by the words of Moses,
   for he does not unreservedly condemn all who should not obey, but
   restricts his law by the addition of a special mark, viz., if the
   contempt should arise from presumption or arrogance. Therefore it was
   not else a capital crime to disobey the priest or the judge, unless any
   one should insolently and proudly oppose himself to the ordinance
   established by God. Otherwise this exception would have been interposed
   without reason. In fine, the priests of old were to be obeyed, as far
   as it concerned the public peace that the pastors ordained by God
   should be reverently honored; yet so as that there should be no
   departure from God Himself, the one Head and Prince of all pastors. We
   have elsewhere seen how foolishly the Papists take this to themselves
   [56]

   13. And all the people. He shews from the object of the enactment why
   the proud despisers (of the priests) were not to be spared; for
   punishments have reference to common example, whilst, on the other
   hand, impunity is a bait to sin, and the nurse of unbridled
   licentiousness. And, assuredly, when He commands that the whole people
   should be inspired with terror, it is a hint that, unless presumption
   should be corrected, and the bold and wicked should be restrained by
   severe discipline, the door would be opened to them to destroy the
   Church.

   Deuteronomy 13

   Deuteronomy 13:6-11

   6. If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
   or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul,
   entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which
   thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

   6. Si incitaverit te frater tuus, filius matris tuae, aut filia tua,
   aut filia tua, aut uxor complexus tui, aut amicus tuus qui sit sicut
   anima tua, clam dicendo, Eamus et colamus deos alienos quos non noveris
   neque tu, neque patres tui:

   7. Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh
   unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even
   unto the other end of the earth;

   7. E diis populorum qui sunt in circuitu vestro, sive propinqui sint,
   sive remoti a te, ab extremo regionis usque ad extremum ejus:

   8. Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall
   thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou
   conceal him:

   8. Non acquiesces ei, neque obedies ei, nec parcet ei oculus tuus,
   neque misereberis, neque occultabis eum:

   9. But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him
   to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

   9. Sed occidendo occides eum: manus tua erit in eum prima ad ipsum
   interficiendum, deinde manus universi populi.

   10. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
   sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee
   out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

   10. Et lapidabis eum lapidibus et morietur: quia quaesivit te
   abstrahere a Jehova Deo tuo, qui eduxit te e terra AEgypti, e domo
   servorum

   11. And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
   wickedness as this is among you.

   11. Ut totus Israel audiant et timeant, nec addant facere quicquam
   simile huic rei pravae in medio tui


   6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother. The punishment which he had
   commanded to be inflicted on false teachers, is now extended to each
   one of the people. For although it is a lighter offense in a private
   individual to draw others with him into error, both because his
   ignorance is excusable, and the profession of a teacher does not
   increase his responsibility, yet a falling away from religion, from
   whencesoever it arises, is intolerable to God. Only, those two points,
   to which we have already adverted, are to be kept in remembrance, viz.,
   that this judgment can have no place except where religion is duly
   constituted; and, also, that all are not to be put to death
   indifferently, who may have erred in some particular, but that this
   severity is only to be exercised against apostates, who pluck up
   religion by the roots, so that the worship of God is adulterated, or
   pure doctrine abolished. Nor indeed does God enjoin that the
   slipperiness of the tongue is to be capitally punished, if it shall
   have inconsiderately let fall something amiss, but rather [57] the
   wicked design of altering the true religion, as the words clearly
   express the matter. It is worth while remarking with what particularity
   God enforces upon us the duty of fostering and upholding religion: for,
   because general laws are usually eluded by various exceptions, He
   expressly says that neither brother, nor son, nor wife, nor intimate
   friend is to be spared. [58] The eye is said to pity, because the very
   look is of great power in awakening the affections on both sides;
   therefore it is not without reason that God requires [59] such courage
   as may be moved to pity neither by tears, nor blandishments, nor the
   sadness of the spectacle. The phrases, too, are emphatic, "thy brother,
   who proceeded from the same womb;" "the wife who sleeps in thy bosom or
   embrace;" "the friend whom you love as yourself;" in order that pure
   zeal, when it sees God's sacred name profaned, may not give way to any
   human affection. Christ says that no one is worthy to be acknowledged
   as His disciple, but he who shall neglect his father, and mother, and
   children, when necessary. So now God declares that all our tenderest
   affections, which are implanted in us by nature, and in which all the
   best persons sometimes indulge, are sinful, if they hinder us from
   vindicating His glory.

   It is pious and praiseworthy to love our wives and children as our own
   bowels; nor is there any reason which forbids us from regarding our
   brother and our friend with similar love; only let God be preferred to
   all, for it is too preposterous to betray His glory for the sake of
   man. For to plead the love due to our wives, or anything of the same
   kind, what is this but to set our affections against God and His
   precepts? Wherefore the desire to mitigate that severity to which He
   would harden us, betrays an effeminacy which He will not endure. Now,
   there are two most just grounds for the heaviness of the punishment;
   first, because we are almost all of us slack when we ought to be very
   zealous in avenging the insults which God may receive; and, secondly,
   because more severe remedies are applied to perilous diseases, so it is
   right that so noxious, and altogether deadly pestilence as this should
   be met with extraordinary means. And to this refers the expression
   "secretly." For although it might seem cruel to betray such as have not
   publicly transgressed, yet, inasmuch as sectaries fly from the light,
   and creep in by clandestine and deceitful arts, it is necessary to
   prevent them from fraudulently infecting individual houses with their
   poison, as always is the case with them. Therefore God would have their
   insidious endeavors checked betimes, lest the contagion should spread.

   7 Namely, of the gods of the people. The sum of the matter is to this
   effect, that we should so acquiesce in the known truth, as that our
   ears may be closed to all the falsehoods by which it is opposed. Men's
   neighborhood to each other commonly produces, by their
   intercommunication, a conformity of habits. Thus errors pass from one
   to the other; [60] and since we are generally prone to evil, the worse
   pervert the better. Since, then, the people of Israel were everywhere
   surrounded by idolaters, they might have easily been enticed to imitate
   them, unless measures were taken to prevent it. But the expression
   "round about" is used, because a pretext for yielding might have been
   taken from the fact, that the Israelites differed in religion not from
   a single nation only, but from all who surrounded them on every side.
   For to whatever quarter they looked, examples presented themselves to
   their eyes, whereby they were attracted to a new and strange form of
   religion. He afterwards amplifies this, by adding, even if those
   nations "be far off from thee;" for the Israelites were not divided
   from their neighbors only, but severed also from the whole human race.
   But this was no slight temptation, that they found no companions in the
   whole world, nor any nation, which agreed with them. Besides, distance
   itself sometimes causes us to have respect for those who are unknown to
   us; since the curiosity of men is volatile, and traverses in its levity
   sea and land, in order to procure for itself pestiferous monsters for
   the sake of their novelty. Meanwhile, God exalts the faith which is
   founded on His Word, in comparison with the manners, institutions,
   rites, and customs of all nations; for none has made any true
   proficiency in religion unless he abominates whatever is opposed to it.

   9 But thou shalt surely kill him. He would not that every one should
   privately execute vengeance without a public trial; but he referred to
   the ordinary custom, that the witnesses should throw the first stone at
   condemned criminals, as we shall see elsewhere. For it was an admirable
   provision, that God would have those who had denounced the crime, to be
   the executors of its punishment, in order that they should be more
   cautious and moderate in giving their testimony. The reason, which is
   added at the end, "because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the
   Lord thy God, who brought thee out," etc., again exaggerates the crime
   on the score of its ingratitude; which was detestable in proportion to
   the inestimable blessing of their deliverance. It was an act of gross
   wickedness to rebel against God after they had known Him; but it was
   still more gross to undervalue their Deliverer. Finally, the advantage
   and fruit of this severity is subjoined; for, whilst punishment was
   inflicted on one man's crime, all others were inspired with terror; and
   thus the death of one is a wholesome discipline for all, in the way of
   example.

   Deuteronomy 13

   Deuteronomy 13:12-17

   12. If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God
   hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

   12. Si audieris de una urbium tuarum quas Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi ut
   habites ibi, aliquem dicen-tem:

   13. Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you,
   and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and
   serve other gods, which ye have not known;

   13. Egressi sunt quidam homines filii impietatis e medio tui, qui
   impulerunt habitatores urbis suae, dicendo, Eamus et colamus deos
   alienos quos non nostis.

   14. Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
   behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is
   wrought among you;

   14. Tunc inquires, et investigabis diligenter: et siquidem veritas sit
   et rumor verus, quod facta sit abominatio ista in medio tui:

   15. Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge
   of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the
   cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

   15. Percutiendo percuties habitatores urbis illius acie gladii,
   perdendo eam, et quicquid in ea fuerit, et jumenta ejus acie gladii.

   16. And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
   street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil
   thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for
   ever; it shall not be built again.

   16. Atque omnia spolia ejus congregabis in medio plateae ejus, et
   combures igni urbem ipsam et omnia spolia ejus prorsus Jehovae Deo tuo,
   eritque tumulus perpetuus, non aedificabitur.

   17. And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:
   that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
   mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath
   sworn unto thy fathers;

   17. Neque adhaerebit manui tuae quicquam de anathemate, ut avertatur
   Jehova ab ira furoris sui, et det tibi misericordias, misereaturque
   tui, ac te multiplicet quemadmodum juravit patribus tuis.


   12. If thou shalt hear say. If impiety and rebellion should more widely
   prevail, Moses declares that whole cities, together with their
   inhabitants, should rather be destroyed, than that so great a crime
   should remain unpunished. Hence we may better infer how unholy is the
   tenderness of those who would have no punishment inflicted for the
   violation of the religion of God. If any sedition may have arisen in an
   army or nation, and the contagion may have spread through the whole
   multitude, the severity of a just and moderate ruler does not usually
   proceed further than to punish the ringleaders; when, therefore, God
   commands all without exception to be destroyed, the great atrocity of
   the crime is made apparent. Hence, too, we are admonished, that zeal
   for God's glory is but cold among us, unless true religion is held to
   be of more value than the preservation of a single city or people. But
   if so many together are to be dragged to death in crowds, their
   impudence is more than detestable, and their pity cruelty itself, who
   would take no account of God's injured majesty, so that one man may be
   spared. And since we are created to no other end, and live for no other
   cause than that God may be glorified in us, it is better that the whole
   world should perish, than that men should enjoy the fruits of the earth
   in order that they may contaminate it with their blasphemies. If those
   who first professed Christ's name had been inspired with such zeal as
   this, true religion would never have been overwhelmed, and almost
   extinguished by so many corruptions. But we must always bear in mind
   what I have already said, that this severity must not be resorted to
   except when the religion is suffering, which is not only received by
   public authority and general opinion, but which is proved on solid
   grounds to be true; so that it may clearly appear that we are the
   avengers of God against the wicked.

   13. Certain men, the children of Belial. Moses puts a case, which very
   often is wont to occur. For all do not break forth into impiety
   together at the same moment, but Satan stirs up some who are like fans
   to excite others; and by their instigations the multitude is led to
   imitate them. Moses calls such as these "children of Belial;" [61] by
   which word some think that rebellious (proefractos) men are pointed
   out, and expound it "without yoke." Their opinion, however, seems to be
   more correct, who interpret it "men of nothing," men in whom nothing
   good or praiseworthy is found; and literally translate it "those who
   are worthless." [62] This expression is invariably applied to the
   wicked (sceleratis, improbis, et nequam;) and therefore Paul,
   contrasting Christ with Belial, designates by it Satan the chief of all
   the wicked. (2 Corinthians 6:15.) He uses the words "gone out," as if
   they had dared to come forward, and openly to parade their impiety.
   But, though the evil may have originated with a few authors, he does
   not mean that punishment should stop with them; as if the instigation
   of others availed as an excuse for the multitude. And he enjoins
   diligent inquiry to be made, for two reasons: viz., lest they should
   connive at the iniquity, and be lax, and careless about it, or lest
   they should be too hasty and precipitate in their judgment; because, on
   the one hand, whilst we are never equitable, nor decide rightly in
   precipitation and anger, so on the other it betrays base indifference,
   and something like disloyalty, to overlook so great a crime. Thus both
   activity and moderation are commended, so that the judge may neither be
   lax, nor make any decision until the matter shall be carefully inquired
   into.

   15 Thou shalt surely smite. Lest the severity of the punishment should
   occasion surprise, let us first observe that the error was
   unpardonable, because its authors, being educated in the doctrines of
   the Law, could not be deceived involuntarily, nor unless they had grown
   weary of religion, and set their hearts on the impostures of the devil.
   On this account God, in the Book of Jeremiah, in order to inveigh more
   heavily against the inconstancy of the Jews, refers them to distant
   isles and nations: "Passover (He says) and consider," etc., "Hath a
   nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have
   changed their glory for that which doth not profit. Be astonished, O ye
   heavens, at this," etc. (Jeremiah 2:10-12.) For justly must their
   instability be accounted monstrous, that they should have voluntarily
   forsaken the fountain of life, and have been carried away to vanity by
   their preposterous love of novelty. If any should object that the
   little children at least were innocent, I reply that, since all are
   condemned by the judgment of God from the least to the greatest, we
   contend against Him in vain, even though He should destroy the very
   infants as yet in their mothers' womb. When Sodom and the neighboring
   cities were swallowed up, we doubt not but that in the mighty multitude
   many infants and pregnant women also perished; and whilst our reason
   struggles against this, it is better rather to look up reverently to
   the Divine tribunal, than to subject it to our own laws. The same may
   be said of the destruction of Babylon; for when the Prophet exclaims:
   "Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the
   stones," he assuredly eulogizes the just vengeance of God. (Psalm
   137:9.) So also in this passage, if it does not appear to us agreeable
   to reason that the whole race of evil-doers should be exterminated, let
   us understand that God is defrauded of His rights, whensoever we
   measure His infinite greatness, which the angels themselves admiringly
   adore, by our own feelings. Although we must recollect that God would
   never have suffered any infants to be destroyed, except those which He
   had already reprobated and condemned to eternal death. But if we admit
   God's right to deprive of the hope of salvation whomsoever He sees fit,
   why should the temporal punishment, which is much lighter, be found
   fault with? Rather let us learn from the severity of this Law, how
   detestable is the crime of setting up false and spurious modes of
   worship, since it contaminates not only the infants, whose age prevents
   them from being conscious of it, [63] but even the cattle and flocks,
   and the very houses and walls. For he proceeds immediately afterwards
   to say,

   16. And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it. They are commanded to
   burn all the furniture, and whatever is found in the city; and the
   reason is subjoined, because it is accursed (anathema) If any city was
   taken in war, all that God here commands to be burnt was to be counted
   as spoil, for the Jews would pollute themselves by its very touch. It
   might be indeed that God's intention was to obviate covetousness, lest
   the Jews should mix up their zeal with rapine; but the principal reason
   was that which Moses expresses, that the people might be more
   accustomed to detest the crime, which they saw to be so cruelly
   punished by God. The word chrm, cherem, which the Greeks have
   translated anathema, [64] properly means destruction, or abolition; but
   that which God would have annihilated, because He cannot bear the sight
   of it, is called chrm, before Him. Therefore it is said, "Thou shalt
   burn it to the Lord thy God;" for the translation which some give, "for
   (propter) the Lord," is not quite literal. The sum is to this effect,
   that if they fear God's vengeance for themselves, and desire to
   propitiate His favor, they must hold in execration the houses and
   property of those who have rebelled against the Law. Moreover, it is
   implied by the words "mercy" and "compassion," that if God should deal
   with absolute justice, the wickedness of one city would suffice to
   destroy a whole country. Whence we gather, that a kind of expiation is
   demanded to propitiate God, when they are commanded utterly to destroy
   the city, and to cast every remnant of it into the fire.

   Exodus 22

   Exodus 22:18

   18. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

                                             18. Maleficam non pateris vivere.


   18. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. In these passages the
   punishment of those is appointed who should in any respect violate the
   worship of God. We have lately seen how severely God avenged apostasy
   from the faith; but now He touches upon certain particular points when
   religion is not professedly forsaken, but some corruption is
   introduced, whereby its purity is affected. The first passage denounces
   capital punishment upon witches; by which name Moses means
   enchantresses, or sorceresses, who devote themselves to magic arts,
   either to injure persons by their fascinations, or to seek revelations
   from the devil; such as she was whom Saul consulted, although she might
   be called by a different name [65] Since such illusions carry with them
   a wicked renunciation of God, no wonder that He would have them
   punished with death. But since this pestilent crime would be no more
   tolerable in a man than a woman, it has been probably supposed that the
   law was directed against women, because their sex is more disposed to
   superstition. Certainly the same enactment is made respecting males in
   Deuteronomy 18:1, [66] only the punishment is not there denounced, but
   God merely prohibits any of the people from being an enchanter or a
   witch. Now it is clear that all the kinds which are there recited, are
   here included under one; so that God would condemn to capital
   punishment all augurs, and magicians, and consulters with familiar
   spirits, and necromancers and followers of magic arts, as well as
   enchanters. And this will appear more plainly from the second and third
   passages, in which God declares that He "will set. His face against
   all, that shall turn after such as have familiar spirits, and after
   wizards," so as to cut them off from His people; and then commands that
   they should be destroyed by stoning. Wherefore, since it is not just
   that men should escape with impunity, when the infirmity of women is
   not spared, nor that dissimilar sentences should be pronounced in
   similar cases, the same punishment which was decreed against witches
   and enchantresses, is now extended to either sex, and to all magical
   superstitions. In the words also "that turneth to go a whoring," the
   atrocity of the crime is again expressed, the similitude being taken
   from immodest women, who seek with wandering glances for the indulgence
   of their lust. Moses, therefore, signifies that, as soon as we begin to
   cast our eyes this way and that, and do not keep them fixed on God
   alone so as to be content with Him, that sacred union [67] is violated
   wherein He has bound us to Himself.

   Numbers 15

   Numbers 15:30, 31

   30. But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in
   the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul
   shall be cut off from among his people.

   30. Anima quae fecerit in manu excelsa, tam civis quam peregrinus, ut
   Jehovam contumelia afficiat, ex-cidetur anima illa e medio populi sui.

   31. Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his
   commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be
   upon him.

   31. Quia sermonem Jehovae contempsit, et praeceptum ejus irritum fecit:
   excidendo excidetur anima illa: iniquitas ejus in ea.


   30. But the soul that doeth ought. This verse is variously translated.
   For some read it thus [68] "The soul that doeth ought with a high hand,
   the same reproacheth the Lord, and, therefore, shall be cut off;" thus
   there would be two propositions. We have followed another opinion,
   reading it connectedly, "The soul, who shall have raised a high hand to
   the reproach of God, shall be cut off " Literally, it is, "The soul,
   who shall have dealt with a high hand, whether born in the land, or a
   stranger, himself blaspheming God, and that soul shall be plucked up
   from the midst of his people." But, since either version is probable,
   and makes no difference in substance, I have allowed myself freely to
   choose that which expressed the meaning more clearly. "To deal with a
   high hand" is nothing more than to attempt, or undertake proudly, what
   is not lawful: for our hands ought to be guided, and, as it were,
   restrained by God's word, lest they should lift themselves up. But
   although men's hands are used in various acts of audacity and
   wantonness, yet here there is especial mention of the profanation of
   God's true and legitimate worship, when anything is invented
   inconsistent with its purity: for the punishment is not decreed against
   thefts, or murders, or other similar crimes, but against the perverse
   imaginations, which tend to the corruption of religion. The reason is
   afterwards added: "Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and
   hath broken His commandment." For it is no light offense to transgress
   the bounds which God hath placed. Now, it is certain that all
   self-invented services betray an impious contempt of God, as if men
   designedly despised Him, and spurned at His commands. Whence we infer,
   that nothing is more opposed to perfect and sincere religion than that
   temerity which induces men to follow whatever course they please. The
   clause, "his iniquity shall be upon him," may be explained in two ways,
   either as a confirmation by Moses of the justice of this punishment,
   and of its merited infliction, or as an admonition, that the impiety
   should be corrected betimes, before it has advanced too far. There is
   no objection to either.

   Leviticus 20

   Leviticus 20:1-6, 27

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of
   the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel,
   that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to
   death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

   2. Filiis Israel dices, Quicunque e filiis Israel, et e peregrinis qui
   peregrinantur in Israel, dederit e semine suo Moloch, moriendo
   morietur: populus terrae lapidibus lapidabit eum.

   3. And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from
   among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to
   defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

   3. Ego etiam ponam faciem meam contra virum illum, et exterminabo eum e
   medio populi sui, eo quod de-derit e semine suo Moloch, ut contaminaret
   sanctuarium meum, et profanaret nomen sanctitatis meae.

   4. And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the
   man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

   4. Quod si abscondendo absconderit populus terrae oculos suos a viro
   illo quando dabit ex semine suo Moloch, non interficiendo illum;

   5. Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
   and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit
   whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

   5. Tunc ponam ego faciem meam in virum illum, et in familiam ejus, et
   succidam eum et omnes qui scor-tantur post ipsum, ut scortentur post
   Moloch, e medio populi sui.

   6. And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and
   after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face
   against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

   6. Anima quae respexerit ad Pythones et ariolos, ad fornicandum post
   eos, ponam faciem meam contra animam illam, et exterminabo e medio
   populi sui.

   27. A man also or woman that hath a familar spirit, or that is a
   wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with
   stones: their blood shall be upon them.

   27. Vir sive muleir in quibus fuerit Python, vel aruspicum spiritus,
   moriendo morietur: lapidando lapidabunt eos: sanguis eorum super eos.


   1. And the Lord spake. The prohibition of this superstition was
   previously expounded in its proper place. God here commands the
   punishment to be inflicted, if any one should have polluted himself
   with it. And surely it was a detestable sacrilege to enslave to idols
   that offspring, which was begotten to God, and which He had adopted in
   the loins of Abraham, since in this way they not only despoiled God of
   His right, but, so far as they could, blotted out the grace of
   adoption. What He had then generally pronounced, He now specially
   applies, viz., that they should be stoned who offered their seed to
   Molech; for otherwise they would have tried to escape on the pretense
   that they had no intention of revolting to other gods. Just as
   now-a-days, under the Papacy, whatever is alleged from Scripture
   against their impious and corrupt worship, is coldly and contemptuously
   received; because they varnish over their idolatries, and so indulge
   themselves in them in security. But after God has commanded His judges
   to punish this crime severely, He at the same time declares that, if
   perchance they should connive at it, and encourage it by their lenity,
   He Himself will avenge it, so as to punish much more heavily those who
   may have escaped from the hands of men; and not only so, but that He
   would implicate all those who might have been aware of it in the same
   con-detonation.

   Exodus 12

   Exodus 12:15, 19

   15. ... Whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the
   seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

   15. Quicunque comederit fermentatum a die primo usque ad diem septimum,
   excidetur anima illa ex Israel.

   19. ... Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
   be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger,
   or born in the land.

   19. Quicunque comederit fermentatum, exterminabitur anima illa e coetu
   Israel: tam peregrinus quam indigena terre.


   15. Whosoever eateth leavened bread. This law specially refers to the
   keeping of the Passover. God had before forbidden the use of leaven;
   and He now enacts the punishment to be inflicted, if any should neglect
   the prohibition, and mingle leaven with the Paschal feast. But it is
   not without reason that we have postponed to this place what Moses has
   joined together with the institution of the Passover; for the plan
   proposed by us demands that the political laws, which sanction God's
   worship by the denunciation of punishments, should occupy their
   peculiar place. From the punishment it appears that, although it may be
   in itself a trifling matter to abstain from leaven, (as Paul teaches
   that "bodily exercise profiteth little," 1 Timothy 4:8,) yet, inasmuch
   as in this ceremony the redemption of the people was kept in memory, it
   was a very gross crime not to observe whatever God had prescribed, for
   we must estimate the importance of the rites of the law from their
   object. [69]

   Deuteronomy 17

   Deuteronomy 17:14-20

   14. When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
   thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I
   will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;

   14. Quum ingressus fueris terrain quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, et
   possederis eam, et habitaveris in ea, ac dixeris, Constituam super me
   regem sicut omnes gentes quae sunt per circuitus meos.

   15. Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy
   God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
   thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy
   brother.

   15. Constituendo constitues super te regem quem elegerit Jehova Deus
   tuus: e medio fratrum tuorum constitues super te regem: non poteris
   constituere super te virum alienigenam, qui non sit frater tuus.

   16. But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
   to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:
   forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no
   more that way.

   16. Verum non multiplicabit sibi equos, neque reducet populum in
   Aegyptum ad multiplicandos equos: quum Jehova dixerit vobis, Non
   adjicietis reverti per hanc viam amplius.

   17. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not
   away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

   17. Neque multiplicabit sibi uxores, neque avertetur cor ejus, neque
   plurimum argentum et aurum sibi cumulabit.

   18. And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
   that he shalt write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
   is before the priests the Levites:

   18. Verum quum sederit super solium regni sui, tunc describet sibi
   exemplar legis hujus in volumine; a conspectu sacerdotum et Levitarum.

   19. And it shalt be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of
   his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the
   words of this law and these statutes, to do them:

   19. Eritque apud eum, et leget in eo cunctis diebus vitae suae: ut
   scilicet discat timere Jehovam Deum suum: et observare omnia verba
   legis hujus, atque statuta haec, ut faciat ea.

   20. That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he
   turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left:
   to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his
   children, in the midst of Israel.

   20. Ne elevetur cor ejus super fratres ipsius, neque declinet a
   praecepto ad dextram aut ad sinistram, ut proroget dies in regno suo:
   ipsc et filii ejus in medio Israelis.


   14. When thou art come unto the land. In this passage God sets forth
   the merits of that sacerdotal kingdom, of which mention is made
   elsewhere; for, since the splendor of the royal name might dazzle their
   eyes, so that they should forget that God retained the sovereignty over
   them, they are thus early admonished how unjust it would be if the
   majesty of God should be diminished by the rule of a mortal man. In
   sum, the power of kings is here put beneath that of God; and kings
   themselves are consecrated unto obedience to Him, lest the people
   should ever turn to ungodliness, whatever change of government might
   take place. But although under the judges religion was often subverted,
   yet it was not without a cause that a special law was enacted with
   respect to kings, because nothing is more likely than that earthly
   pomps should draw men away from piety. Now we understand the design of
   God in this matter, let us proceed to examine its several parts. He
   passes over (as I have said) all the intermediate time until the
   beginning of the kingdom, because this new state of things brought with
   it an increase of danger: for as long as the judges were in power,
   their different form of government separated the Jews from heathen
   nations. All the surrounding neighbors were subject to kings; and God
   always retained the preeminence, whilst He raised up judges from
   amongst the people; but when they began to choose kings for themselves,
   they were so mixed up with the Gentiles, that it was easy for them to
   fall into other corruptions. For the very similarity (of their
   governments) united them more closely; wherefore, it is expressly said,
   When thou shalt set a king over thee "like as all the nations that are
   about" thee. For God signifies that the example of the nations would be
   an evil snare to them, that they should desire to have a king, and thus
   their condition would in future be identical, though by divine decree
   it had been distinct. In short, their rebellion is here indirectly
   condemned, when God foretells that they would wantonly shake off their
   yoke; as indeed actually took place, when they rejected Samuel, and
   tumultuously required a king. On which point God elsewhere complains
   that He was despised. But the question arises, how these two things can
   be reconciled, that kings should reign over them from the lust or
   foolish desire of the people, and yet that the kingdom was the chief
   glory of the people, a special pledge of God's favor, and consequently
   of their welfare and full felicity. The prophecy of Jacob is well
   known,

   "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, -- until Shiloh come."
   (Genesis 49:10.)

   Whence it appears that a king was promised to the children of Abraham
   as an inestimable blessing. Why, then, does not God declare Himself its
   author? I reply that, although it was God's design from the beginning
   to set up David as a type of Christ, yet, because their unseemly haste
   disturbed the order of things, the commencement of the kingdom is
   ascribed to the people's fault, when they were impelled by their
   perverse emulation to wish to be like the Gentiles. God appears then to
   have designedly censured their wilfulness, as if He had said, "Although
   by appointing a king, you approach more nearly to the Gentiles, beware
   lest your perverse desire should altogether turn you away from true
   religion.

   15. Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee. First of all, God
   maintains His own supremacy in the appointment of a king, and does not
   consign the matter to the people's own suffrages; that thus He may
   chastise their audacity in demanding a king in accordance with a hasty
   impulse. Secondly, He commands that he should be taken from the people
   themselves, and excludes foreigners, because, if they had been
   admitted, a door was opened to apostasy; for each would have tried to
   force upon them his native gods, and true religion would have been
   persecuted by the force and threatenings of the royal power. Behold why
   God would not suffer a king to be sought elsewhere but from the bosom
   of His Church; in order that he might cherish and maintain that pure
   worship which he had imbibed from his childhood.

   16 But he shall not multiply horses. The royal power is here
   circumscribed within certain limits, lest it should exalt itself too
   much in reliance on the glory of its dignity, [70] For we know how
   insatiable are the desires of kings, inasmuch as they imagine that all
   things are lawful to them. Therefore, although the royal dignity may be
   splendid, God would not have it to be the pretext of unrestrained
   power, but restricts and limits it to legal bounds. [71] rq, rak, is an
   adversative particle which some construe only; almost with the same
   meaning, because this exception was added to restrain the passions of
   their kings. The first prohibition is, that he should not collect for
   himself a multitude of horses; but, since it is twice repeated, we must
   consider why it is so. Many thus translate it, "He shall not multiply
   horses, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to multiply horses;"
   but this manner of speaking is harsh and obscure. Now, since the
   particle lmn lemagnan, signifies "for the sake of (propter), it may be
   properly translated to the letter, "for the sake of multiplying
   horses," (propter multiplicare, vel propter ad multiplicandum.) I have
   no doubt, then, but that God condemns an immoderate number of horses
   from the consequences which might ensue; because it might excite the
   minds of the kings rashly to undertake expeditions against the
   Egyptians. This, therefore, I consider to be the genuine meaning, that
   the king should not provide himself with horses in too great numbers,
   lest, when he was in possession of many horses, he should lead his army
   into Egypt. Thus, amongst other evils which might arise from a
   multitude of horses, Moses mentions this, that the king's mind will be
   puffed up with pride, so as to invade Egypt with an army of horse. Now,
   the question is, why God forbade His people to return by that way? Some
   explain it, that the horses would be brought contrary to God's command,
   who had forbidden them to trade (with that people;) [72] but this does
   not seem appropriate. Others think that the people were prohibited from
   passing the desert, lest in their curiosity they should be ungrateful
   to God; but this, too, is far-farfetched. To me it seems probable, that
   this journey was prohibited them, in order that, being mindful of their
   deliverance, they should be content with their own boundaries. They had
   been rescued from a thousand deaths: if they had voluntarily gone
   thither to provoke an adversary, their confidence would have been a
   sign of their despising and forgetting God's grace. Therefore, in order
   that the recollection of their redemption should be deeply impressed
   upon their minds, God would have the honor put upon His miracles, that
   they should avoid those regions like the abysses of death. Unless
   perhaps this reason may be preferred, that a handle for those wicked
   alliances was cut off, which we see were audaciously contracted,
   because the kings of Israel gloried in the abundance of their cavalry.
   But the former explanation is most suitable. This law, however, was not
   obeyed by their best kings; and hence it appears that the wilfulness
   and pride of their kings could scarcely be repressed by any restraints.

   17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself. Polygamy at that time
   had generally prevailed, so that the very humblest of the people
   violated the marriage vow with impunity; and therefore it was necessary
   that the kings should be bound with closer restrictions, lest by their
   example they should give greater countenance to incontinency. And thus
   their ignorance is easily refuted who conclude that what was specially
   interdicted to the kings was permitted to private individuals, whereas
   the law of chastity was imposed upon the former, because without this
   remedy there would be no bounds to their lasciviousness. Besides, the
   people would have been subjected to great expense on their account,
   since such is the ambition of women, that they would all have desired
   to receive royal treatment, and would have even vied with each other in
   finery, as actually came to pass. David transgressed this law, and in
   some degree excusably on account of his repudiation by Michal; still it
   appears that lust had more power over him than the continency
   prescribed by God. What follows is so connected by some as if it were
   the reason of the foregoing sentence, in this way, "that kings were not
   to multiply wives to themselves, lest their heart should turn away from
   what was right," as was the case with Solomon; for, from being too
   devoted to his wives, and being deceived by the snares of women, he
   fell into idolatry. And assuredly it can scarcely fail to happen, that
   when many wives beset a man, they must render his mind effeminate, and
   stifle in him all his manly good sense. Yet I prefer taking the clause
   separately, that kings must beware lest the splendor of their dignity
   should affect the soundness of their judgment, for nothing is more
   difficult than for one in great power to continue disposed to
   temperance. Therefore God does not in vain enjoin that they should
   constantly persevere in their duty, and not lose their understanding.
   Moreover, He forbids kings to heap up treasures, because it cannot be
   done without rapine and violent exactions; whilst, at the same time,
   wealth encourages them audaciously to undertake unjust wars, incites
   them to gross dissipation, and at length hurries them forward to
   tyrannical excesses. First, therefore, God would have kings beware,
   lest in their pursuit of riches they should exhaust the blood of the
   people, and lest they should lavish their ill-gotten money in
   superfluous expenses, and be extravagant with what belongs to others;
   and lastly, lest they should be tempted by the pride of wealth to
   attempt unlawful things.

   18. And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne. It would not be
   enough to correct their errors unless kings were also instructed in the
   fear of God, and properly taught their duty; now, therefore, a system
   of discipline is added, whereby it was profitable for them to be
   grounded in the study of religion and justice, viz., that they should
   take the Law from the priests and Levites, which was to be the rule of
   all their actions. Because the demonstrative pronoun is used, [73] some
   think that only the book of Deuteronomy is referred to, but without
   good reason. I make no doubt but that the whole sum of doctrine is
   included, which is delivered both here and in Exodus and Leviticus. But
   although it was without exception to be common to all, yet in order
   that kings might be more assiduously attentive in reading it, God would
   have a copy peculiarly dedicated to their use by the priests and
   Levites, and given into their hands in a solemn ceremony; that kings
   might know that they required greater wisdom and counsel for ruling the
   people than private persons. When, therefore, the priests and Levites
   presented them with this book, it was as if God deposited this treasure
   with the king. He then enjoins that they should exercise themselves in
   the doctrine of the Law through the whole course of their lives,
   because kings are usually supplied with books only out of ostentation
   and pomp, and when they have tasted of what is taught in them,
   straightway grow tired and cease to read them. Finally, the object of
   their reading is subjoined: first of all, in general, that they may
   learn to fear God and keep His statutes; and, secondly, lest, being
   lifted up with pride and vanity, they should despise and oppress their
   brethren. And the word brethren is used designedly, lest they should
   imagine that the law of brotherhood was abolished, because they were
   set over the whole people; but rather that they should study to cherish
   all as members (of themselves.) Again, it is afterwards repeated, lest
   they should "turn aside to the right hand or the left;" because, when
   men have much liberty of action, their lusts can never be sufficiently
   restrained. But, lest it should be grievous to them to be thus reduced
   to order, finally God reminds them that this moderation would be useful
   to them, for that they thus would prolong their reigns; whereas the
   tyranny of kings is often their destruction; as the Lacedemonian king
   replied, when his wife was annoyed that the Ephori were appointed to
   restrain him, "that he should indeed leave less power to his children,
   but that it would be the more lasting. [74] But, here a long succession
   is promised by God's favor, if they were willing to guide themselves
   aright.

   Deuteronomy 20

   Deuteronomy 20:1-4

   1. When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
   horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of
   them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of
   the land of Egypt.

   1. Quum egressus fueris ad praelium contra hostes tuos ac videris
   equitatum, currus, et populum majorem te, non metues ab illis: quia
   Jehova Dens tuus tecum est, qui te eduxit e terra AEgypti.

   2. And it shall be, when ye are come nigh untothe battle, that the
   priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

   2. Et quum occurreritis ad praelium, accedet sacerdos ad populum,

   3. And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel; ye approach this day unto
   battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint; fear not, and
   do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

   3. Ac dicet illis, Audi Israel, vos occurretis hodie ad praeliandum cum
   hostibus vestris: ne mollescat cor vestrum, neque timeatis, neque
   terreamini, neque paveatis a facie eorum:

   4. For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you
   against your enemies, to save you.

   4. Quoniam Jehova Deus vester incredit vobiscum ad praeliandum pro
   vobis contra hostes vestros, et ad servandum vos.


   1 When thou goest out to battle. This law also, which concerns their
   political government, is a Supplement to the First Commandment,
   enacting that they should carry on their wars under the auspices of
   God, and, trusting in His help, should follow Him as their leader. For
   it behoved them to give this proof of their piety, so as to look to God
   not less in war than in peace, and not to rest their hopes of safety on
   anything but the invocation of His name. Whence we gather that the
   worship of God should be by no means passed over in civil and earthly
   government; for, although its direct object is to preserve mutual
   equity between men, yet religion always ought to hold the first, place.
   The sum, therefore, is that, amidst the very clang of arms, they must
   not be in such confusion as not to recognize that they are under the
   guardianship of God, or to lose the confidence they will be safe in
   reliance on His power. He does not, however, encourage them rashly to
   engage in war, but takes it for granted that there is a legitimate
   cause for it; because this would be a gross abuse of God's name, to
   seek a prosperous issue from Him, when we are engaged in anything
   contrary to His command. But He forbids them to fear, although the
   enemy should be superior in horses, in multitude, and in all their
   warlike array; and in these words He reminds them that they would not
   be liable to suffer defeat, because they were not supplied with
   abundance of chariots and horses; for we have lately seen that not even
   their kings were permitted to collect the forces in which the Gentile
   nations gloried; and therefore, lest the consciousness of their
   weakness should make them afraid, God declares that His strength would
   be a sufficient safeguard to them. And without question that passage in
   Psalm 20:7, is taken from hence, "Some trust in chariots, and some in
   horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God." On which
   score Isaiah reproves the people, because, refusing the waters of
   Shiloah, they long for great and rapid rivers; viz., as he elsewhere
   explains it, because they trust in the horsemen of Egypt. (Isaiah 8:6;
   31:1.) But we must observe upon what their security is to be founded,
   viz., because the people ought to hope that the same Divine power would
   be with them to the end, which their fathers had experienced when they
   were redeemed from Egypt.

   2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh. God commits the duty of
   exhortation to the priests, when the time of the conflict shall have
   arrived. But we gather from the expressions used that this passage is
   supplementary to the First Commandment, for it contains no more than
   that the priest should encourage the Israelites to confidence, the
   ground of which is declared to be the help of God in preserving and
   constantly protecting the Church, which He has once redeemed. Moreover,
   He forbids their fears not in one word only, but heaps many together,
   "let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye
   terrified." By this we are reminded how difficult it is to cure that
   evil -- fear, which in so many different ways assails and disturbs our
   minds, that they should not rest in God. And surely we all experience
   that we are troubled by such various besetments, that we have need of
   manifold remedies for the establishment of our faith. We must observe,
   too, the familiar representation of the presence of God, that He should
   go together with His people, to save them, viz., if they should be
   exposed to danger not by their own fault, but by the unjust aggression
   of their enemies.

   Numbers 10

   Numbers 10:1-10

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make
   them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and
   for the journeying of the camps.

   2. Fac tibi duas tubas argenteas: opere ductili facies illas: quae sint
   tibi ad convocationem coetus, et ad castra movenda.

   3. And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble
   themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   3. Quum clangent illis, congregabuntur ad te omnes coetus ad ostium
   tabernaculi testimonii.

   4. And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are
   heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

   4. Si vero una clanxerint, congregabuntur ad te principes, capita
   millium Israelis.

   5. When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
   shall go forward.

   5. Si vero clanxeritis cum jubilatione, proficiscentur castra eorum qui
   castrametantur ad Orientem.

   6. When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on
   the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for
   their journeys.

   6. Quum autem clanxeritis cum jubilatione secundo, tum proficiscentur
   castra eorum qui castrametantur ad meridiem; cum jubilatione clangent
   in profectionibus suis.

   7. But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow,
   but ye shall not sound an alarm.

   7. Quando vero congregabitis coetum, clangetis, sed absque
   jubila.tione.

   8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
   and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
   generations.

   8. Filii autem Aharon sacerdotes clangent tubis illis, eruntque vobis
   in statutum perpetuum per aetates vestras.

   9. And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth
   you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be
   remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your
   enemies.

   9. Et quando venietis ad praelium in terra vestra contra hostem vestrum
   qui vos affliget, cum jubilatione clangetis tubis illis: et recordatio
   vestri erit coram Jehova Deo vestro, ut servemini ab hostibus vestris.

   10. Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in
   the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over
   your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
   that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD
   your God.

   10. Die quoque laetitiae vestrae, et in solennitatibus vestris, et in
   principiis mensium vestrorum clangetis tubis illis super holocausta, et
   super sacrificia prosperitatum vestrarum, ut sint vobis in
   recordationem coram Deo vestro: ego Jehova Deus vester.


   2 Make thee two trumpets of silver. This passage respecting the silver
   trumpets, which gave the gathering-signal, so that the people should
   always be attentive to the voice and will of God, is properly annexed
   to the First Commandment. For God would have the Israelites set in
   motion by their sound, whithersoever they were to go, so that they
   should not dare to commence anything either in war or in peace, except
   under His guidance and auspices, as it were. But their use was
   threefold, viz., to gather the people or the rulers to public
   assemblies; to arm them against their enemies; and, thirdly, to
   announce the sacrifices and festivals. It might seem absurd, and
   somewhat indecorous, to appoint the priests to be trumpeters, since
   there was no splendor or dignity in this office; but God would in this
   way awaken greater reverence in the minds of the people, that the
   authority of the priests should precede all their actions. For this
   office, to which they were appointed, was no servile one, as that they
   should blow the trumpets at the command of others; but rather did God
   thus set them over public affairs, that the people might not
   tumultuously call their assemblies in the blindness and precipitation
   of passion, but rather that modesty, gravity, and moderation should be
   observed in them. We know how often in earthly affairs God is not
   regarded, but counsels are confidently discussed without reference to
   His word. He testified, therefore, by this employment of the priests,
   that all assemblies, except those in which He should preside, were
   accursed. Profane nations also had their ceremonies, such as auguries,
   supplications, soothsayings, victims, [75] because natural reason
   dictated that nothing could be engaged in successfully without Divine
   assistance; but God would have His people bound to Him in another way,
   so that, when called by the sound of the sacred trumpets as by a voice
   from heaven, they should assemble to holy and pious deliberations. The
   circumstance of the place also has the same object. The door of the
   Tabernacle was to them, as if they placed themselves in the sight; of
   God. We will speak of the wordmvd , mogned [76] elsewhere. Although it
   signifies an appointed time, or place, and also an assembly of the
   people, I prefer translating it convention, because God there in a
   solemn manner, as if before His sacred tribunal, called the people to
   witness, or, according to appointment, proceeded to make a covenant
   with them.

   He was also unwilling that wars should be undertaken precipitately, or
   with the desire of vengeance, but that the priests should perform the
   office of heralds, (feciales,) in order that he might be the originator
   of them himself. But it was honorable for the priests to be the
   proclaimers of the festivals, and to cite the people to the sanctuary.
   Now, since we understand the intention of the Legislator, let us
   briefly touch upon the words. We have said that the priests, when they
   sounded, were, as it were, the organs or interpreters of God, that the
   Israelites might depend upon His voice and commandment. If the princes
   or heads of thousands only were to be called, they sounded only once;
   if it was a convocation of the whole people, they doubled the sound. A
   similar distinction was observed in war, that a different signal should
   be given, according as the camps of either side were to advance. Some
   use the fictitious word taratantara, [77] in place of what I have
   translated "with jubilation:" it is probable that it was a louder and
   more protracted sound, but blown with intervals. We must, however,
   observe the promise, which is inserted, that the Israelites "should be
   remembered before the Lord," that He should put their enemies to
   flight; not as if the safety or deliverance of the people was attached
   to the trumpets, but because they did not go to the battle except in
   reliance on God's aid. For the reality itself is conjoined with the
   external symbol, viz., that they should fight under God, should follow
   Him as their Leader, and should account all their strength to be in His
   grace. And that all the saints were guided by this rule appears from
   Psalm 20:7, --

   "Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the
   name of the Lord our God:"

   and again, "There is no king saved by the multitude of an host; a
   mighty man is not delivered by much strength. Behold, the eye of the
   Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy."
   (Psalm 33:16-18)

   10. Also in the day of your gladness. This was as if God should make it
   manifest that He approved of no festivals, and that no sacrifices
   pleased Him, except His command should go before them; for it was not
   lawful for the people to choose this or that day, but the authority for
   prescribing them was in the hands of the ministers of sacred things.
   And, indeed, God Himself had appointed the New-moons (Neomenias, vel
   novilunia) and the other solemnities; but, lest any change should
   occur, since men are ever daring in their innovations, He would have
   their lawful observation sanctioned by the sound of the trumpets; as
   if, by the mouth of the priests, He Himself published the holy
   assemblies. The sacrifices, which others have translated "of your
   peace-offerings," [78] I translate, and not without reason, "of your
   prosperities." For this is what slmykm, shalmecem, properly means; and
   it was the name they gave to their supplications and testimonies of
   thanksgiving, when they had been delivered from some great danger, or
   were visited by some extraordinary blessing from God. But Moses says
   that the trumpets were to be "for a memorial before their God;" because
   when they should have assembled at His command, He would look upon
   them, and honor them with His paternal favor.

   The Second Commandment

     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 20

   Exodus 20:4-6

   4. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
   anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
   that is in the water under the earth:

   4. Non facies tibi sculptlie, neque ullam imaginem eorum quae sunt in
   coelo sursum, neque eorum qae in terra deorsum, neque eorum quae in
   aquis sunt subter terram.

   5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
   LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
   hate me;

   5. Non adorabis ea, neque coles ea, ego enim Jehova Deus tuus, Deus
   zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum super filios, in tertiam et
   quartam generationem in his qui me oderunt:

   6. And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
   commandments.

   6. Et faciens misericordiam: in mille diligentibus me, et
   custodientibus praecepta mea.


   4. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. In the First
   Commandment, after He had taught who was the true God, He commanded
   that He alone should e worshipped; and now He defines what is His
   Legitimate Worship. Now, since these are two distinct things, we
   conclude that the commandments are also distinct, in which different
   things are treated of. The former indeed precedes in order, viz., that
   believers are to be contented with one God; but it would not be
   sufficient for us to be instructed to worship him alone, unless we also
   knew the manner in which He would be worshipped. The sum is, that the
   worship of God must be spiritual, in order that it may correspond with
   His nature. For although Moses only speaks of idolatry, yet there is no
   doubt but that by synecdoche, as in all the rest of the Law, he
   condemns all fictitious services which men in their ingenuity have
   invented. For hence have arisen the carnal mixtures whereby God's
   worship has been profaned, that they estimate Him according to their
   own reason, and thus in a manner metamorphose Him. It is necessary,
   then, to remember what God is, lest we should form any gross or earthly
   ideas respecting Him. The words simply express that it is wrong [79]
   for men to seek the presence of God in any visible image, because He
   cannot be represented to our eyes. The command that they should not
   make any likeness, either of any thing which is in heaven, or in the
   earth, or in the waters under the earth, is derived from the evil
   custom which had everywhere prevailed; for, since superstition is never
   uniform, but is drawn aside in various directions, some thought that
   God was represented under the form of fishes, others under that of
   birds, others in that of brutes; and history especially recounts by
   what shameless delusions Egypt was led astray. And hence too the vanity
   of men is declared, since, whithersoever they turn their eyes, they
   everywhere lay hold of the materials of error, notwithstanding that
   God's glory shines on every side, and whatever is seen above or below,
   invites us to the true God.

   Since, therefore, men are thus deluded, so as to frame for themselves
   the materials of error from all things they behold, Moses now elevates
   them above the whole fabric and elements of the world; for by the
   things that are "in heaven above," he designates not only the birds,
   but the sun, and the moon, and all the stars also; as will soon be
   seen. He declares, then, that a true image of God is not to be found in
   all the world; and hence that His glory is defiled, and His truth
   corrupted by the lie, whenever He is set before our eyes in a visible
   form. Now we must remark, that there are two parts in the Commandment
   -- the first forbids the erection of a graven image, or any likeness;
   the second prohibits the transferring of the worship which God claims
   for Himself alone, to any of these phantoms or delusive shows.
   Therefore, to devise any image of God, is in itself impious; because by
   this corruption His Majesty is adulterated, and He is figured to be
   other than He is. There is no need of refuting the foolish fancy of
   some, that all sculptures and pictures are here condemned by Moses, for
   he had no other object than to rescue God's glory from all the
   imaginations which tend to corrupt it. And assuredly it is a most gross
   indecency to make God like a stock or a stone. Some expound the words,
   "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven image, which thou mayest
   adore;" [80] as if it were allowable to make a visible image of God,
   provided it be not adored; but the expositions which will follow will
   easily refute their error. Meanwhile, I do not deny that these things
   are to be taken connectedly, since superstitious worship is hardly ever
   separated from the preceding error; for as soon as any one has
   permitted himself to devise an image of God, he immediately falls into
   false worship. And surely whosoever reverently and soberly feels and
   thinks about God Himself, is far from this absurdity; nor does any
   desire or presumption to metamorphose God ever creep in, except when
   coarse and carnal imaginations occupy our minds. Hence it comes to
   pass, that those, who frame for themselves gods of corruptible
   materials, superstitiously adore the work of their own hands. I will
   then readily allow these two things, which are inseparable, to be
   joined together; only let us recollect that God is insulted, not only
   when His worship is transferred to idols, but when we try to represent
   Him by any outward similitude.

   THE REPETITION FROM DEUTERONOMY 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   Deuteronomy 5

   Deuteronomy 5:8-10

   8. Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
   thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that
   is in the waters beneath the earth:

   8. Non facies tibi sculptile, vel ullam imaginem eorum quae sunt in
   coelo sursum, nec eorum quae sunt in terra deorsum, nec eorum quae sunt
   in aquis sub terra.

   9. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the
   Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
   hate me,

   9. Non adorabis ea, neque coles: ego enim Jehova Deus tuus, Deus
   zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum super filios, in tertiam et
   quartam generationem in his qui me oderunt.

   10. And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
   commandments.

   10. Faciens autem misericordiam in millia diligentibus me, et
   custodientibus praecepta mea.


   9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them. Idolaters in vain endeavor
   to elude this second point by their foolish cavils; as amongst the
   Papists that trifling distinction is commonly advanced, that only
   latreia, [81] and not deleia is prohibited. For Moses, first of all,
   comprehends generally all the Forms And Ceremonies Of Worship; and then
   adds immediately afterwards the word vd, gnabad, which means properly
   to serve. Hence we conclude that they make a childish endeavor at
   evasion, when they pay only the honor of service to pictures and
   statues. But if we grant them what they desire, not even so will they
   escape; because the prohibition is equivalent to God's declaring that
   He will not be worshipped in wood and stone, or in any other likeness.
   For unbelievers have never been carried away to such an extent of folly
   as to adore mere statues or pictures; they have always alleged the same
   pretext which now-a-days is rife in the mouths of the Papists, viz.,
   that not the image itself was actually worshipped, but that which it
   represented. But the Spirit everywhere reproves them for worshipping
   gods of wood and stone, since God rejects that carnal worship which
   unbelievers offer before stocks and stones. If any one should ask them,
   whom they have it in their mind to worship, they will immediately
   reply, that they offer to God that honor which they pay to pictures and
   statues. But this frivolous excuse comes to nothing; because to erect
   the idol before which they prostrate themselves, is really to deny the
   true God; and, therefore, no wonder that He should declare that
   unbelievers worship wood and stone, when they worship in that wood and
   stone phantoms of their own imagination. And we have already said, that
   all rites which do not accord with the spiritual worship of God, are
   here forbidden: and this is enough, and more than enough to put to
   flight all such misty notions, (nebulas.)

   For I the Lord thy God. He partly terrifies them by threats, and partly
   attracts them by sweet promises, in order to keep them in the way of
   duty. In the earlier expressions He convicts them of ingratitude, if
   they prostitute themselves to idolatry, when they had been chosen to be
   a peculiar and holy people. He afterwards inspires them with terror, by
   the denunciation of punishment; and, finally, allures them with the
   hope of reward, if they obediently abide in the pure worship of God.
   Nor does He affirm that He will be severe or kind to individuals only,
   but extends both to their posterity, although, as we shall afterwards
   see, not equally. I have indeed assigned another place to the promises
   and threatenings, whereby the authority of the whole Law is sanctioned;
   but since this clause is annexed to a particular Commandment, it could
   not be conveniently separated from it. The word 'l, el, some translate
   appellatively, mighty; but since God is so called from His might, I
   have preferred following this meaning, [82] which is more suitable
   here. Yet I do not think that Moses used various names without reason;
   for when he had first employed the name 'lhym, elohim, he soon
   afterwards honors God by another title, and magnifies His power, that
   He may be feared. And for this reason he also calls Him the Rival, [83]
   or, as some not inaptly translate it, the jealous; for to give the name
   of "the envious" (obtrectatoris) to God, as somebody has done, is not
   only silly, but monstrous. This is the word by which Cicero renders
   zelotupian, [84] expressing by it the sin of guilty rivalry, when one
   person envies the superiority of another. But God is here set before us
   in the character of a husband, who suffers no rival; or if it be
   preferred to extend the meaning of the word, He is called the assertor
   of His rights; since His rivalry is nothing more than retaining what is
   His own, and thus excluding all the rivals of His honor. Because
   mention has lately been made of His sacred covenant with the Jews,
   Moses seems to allude to the violation of this spiritual marriage. But
   although he begins with threatening, still, far preferring mercy to His
   severity, He rather gently allures them, than compels them by fear, to
   allegiance; for He declares that He will be merciful even to a thousand
   generations; whilst He only denounces punishment on the thirds and
   fourths, (for thus it is literally expressed,) i.e., on their grandsons
   and great-grandsons. In order, therefore, to encourage His worshippers
   to earnest piety, He declares that He will be kind, not only to
   themselves, but to their posterity, even for a thousand generations.
   But this is the proof of His inestimable kindness, and even indulgence,
   that He deigns to bind Himself to His servants, to whom He owes
   nothing, so far as to acknowledge, in His favor towards them, their
   seed also for His people. For hence it appears, that it is wrong to
   infer merit from the promised reward, because He does not say that He
   will be faithful or just towards the keepers of His Law, but merciful.
   Let then the most perfect come forward, and he can require nothing
   better of God than that He should be favorable to him on the grounds of
   His gratuitous liberality. For chsd, chesed, is equivalent to kindness,
   or beneficence; but when it is applied to God, it generally signifies
   mercy, or paternal favor, and the blessings which flow from it.

   Since, then, He here promises that He will shew mercy, it is as much as
   to say that He will be beneficent, or will deal with clemency. Hence it
   follows, that the main source of reward is that. gratuitous beneficence
   wherewith He liberally blesses His people. Now, when it is said, "unto
   them that love me," [85] the fountain and origin of true righteousness
   is expressed; for the external observation of the Law would be of no
   avail unless it flowed from hence. And praise is given to love rather
   than to fear, because God is delighted with none but voluntary
   obedience, but He rejects that which is forced and servile, as we shall
   again see elsewhere. But because hypocrites also boast that they love
   God, whilst their life corresponds not with the profession of their
   lips, the two things are here distinctly connected; viz., that the true
   servants of God love Him, and keep His commandments, i.e., make
   effectual proof of their piety. But here a difficult question arises,
   for the history of all ages shews that a great proportion of the
   progeny of the holy have been rejected and condemned; and that God has
   inflicted upon them weightier manifestations of His curse and
   vengeance, than upon strangers. We must, however, observe, that in
   these words grace is not promised severally to all the posterity of the
   saints, as if God were bound to each individual who may derive their
   race and original from them. There were many degenerate children of
   Abraham, to whom it profited nothing that they were called the
   offspring of the holy patriarch; nor indeed is the promise restricted
   to individuals, for many who are children after the flesh, are not
   counted for the seed -- but God in His free election adopts whom He
   will, yet so governs His judgments, as that His paternal favor should
   always abide with the race of believers. Besides, the fruits of this
   promised grace are manifested in temporal blessings; and thus although
   God severely avenged the sins of the children of Abraham, and at length
   when their impiety shewed itself to be desperate, renounced them, yet
   did He not fail to be kind to them for a thousand generations. For
   again, God fulfills and performs what He here promised by the outward
   testimonies of His favor, although they turn to the destruction of the
   reprobate. Thus He was merciful to the race of Abraham, as long as he
   saw fit to leave them the Law, the Prophets, the Temple, and other
   exercises of religion. [86] Now, again, it will be well for us to
   consider how far even the holiest fall short of the perfect keeping of
   the Law, and perfect love of God; and therefore we need not wonder if
   they experience in many respects the failure of this grace, and only
   enjoy some slight taste of it. In any case, the goodness of God ever
   superabounds, so that His grace, if it does not shine with full
   splendor, still appears in bright sparks unto a thousand generations.
   As to the opposite clause, wherein God limits His vengeance to the
   third or fourth generation, we see how He prefers to attract men to
   duty by gentle invitations, than by terrifying threatenings to extort
   from them more than they are willing to do; inasmuch as He extends His
   mercy further than the severity of His judgment. We must also observe
   that the transgressors of the Law are called the enemies and haters of
   God. It is surely horrible, and almost monstrous impiety to hate God;
   and scarcely would any one be found so wicked as openly to declare Him
   to be his enemy; yet it is not without a cause that God pronounces thus
   harshly respecting their impiety; for since He cannot be separated from
   His justice, a contempt of the Law convicts men of this hatred; for it
   is impossible that they should not wish to deprive Him of His dominion,
   who endure Him not as a Lawgiver and a Judge.

   "To visit iniquities," is equivalent to inquiring into them, or taking
   cognizance of them, in order that punishment should be inflicted in
   proportion to the crime; for as long as God spares men and suspends His
   judgment, He seems to connive at them, or to pay no attention to them.
   Therefore, when men shall think that their sin is buried, He declares
   that He will bear it in memory. But it may be asked, how it is
   consistent for God to exact punishment from the children or
   grandchildren on account of the sins of their fathers? for nothing is
   more unreasonable than that the innocent and guilty should be involved
   in the same punishment; and the declaration of the Prophet is well
   known,

   "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the
   father bear the iniquity of the son; but the soul that sinneth, it
   shall die." (Ezekiel 18:20.)

   The difficulty, which arises from the words of the Prophet, is easily
   solved, for God therein refutes the wicked expostulation of the people,
   that their children, who were not in fault, were unjustly and cruelly
   exposed to punishment. The proverb was generally rife, that "the
   fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on
   edge;" but God replies, that not one of those with whom He was angry
   and severe was free from crime; and, therefore, that their complaint
   was false, since each of them received the recompense of his own
   iniquity. And this is most true, that God's severity never assails the
   innocent; and however the world may murmur against His judgments, that
   He will always be clear in condemning this person or that [87]

   But when God declares that He will cast back the iniquity of the
   fathers into the bosom of the children, He does not mean that He will
   take vengeance on poor wretches who have never deserved anything of the
   sort; but that He is at liberty to punish the crimes of the fathers
   upon their children and descendants, with the proviso that they too may
   be justly punished, as being the imitators of their fathers. If any
   should object, that this is nothing more than to repay every one
   according to his works, we must remember that, -- whenever God blinds
   the children of the ungodly, casts them into a state of reprobation,
   (conjicit in sesum reprobum), and smites them with a spirit of madness
   or folly, so that they give themselves up to foul desires, and hasten
   to their final destruction, -- in this way the iniquity of the fathers
   is visited on their children. But suppose other punishments are added,
   all are under condemnation (convicti,) so that they have no ground for
   murmuring against God; and even then also God still proceeds to execute
   the vengeance which He here denounces; for, when He would direct one
   work to various objects, He uses wonderful and secret expedients. When
   He commanded the people of Canaan to be destroyed, it is certain that
   those, who then were living, were worthy of this punishment; yet,
   inasmuch as God foretold [88] that their iniquities were not yet full,
   we infer that He then inflicted the punishment upon them which He had
   deferred for 400 years. On this ground, Christ declares that the Jews
   of His time were guilty of all the blood that had been shed from that
   of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, the son of Barachias, (Matthew
   23:35.) But if it be not agreeable to our judgment that God should
   repay every one according to his deserts, and yet that He at the same
   time requires the sins of their fathers of the children, we should
   remember that His judgments are a great depth; and, therefore, if
   anything in His dealings is incomprehensible to us, we must bow to it
   with sobriety and reverence. But since this doctrine will recur
   elsewhere, I have thought fit only to touch upon it lightly here. One
   question remains, how we can reconcile the statement of Paul, that the
   fifth commandment is the first with promise, (Ephesians 6:2,) whereas a
   promise is annexed to this second. The solution of this is easy; for if
   you duly consider, this promise, which we have now explained, is not
   peculiarly annexed to any single commandment, but is common to the
   whole first Table of the Law, and these refer to the whole service of
   God; but when it is said, "honor thy father and thy mother, that thy
   days may be long," the keeping of that commandment is particularly and
   specially sanctioned.

   17. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

   4. Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the
   Lord your God.

   4. Ne vertatis vos ad idola, neque deos conflatiles faciatis vobis: ego
   Jehova Deus vester.


   Leviticus 26

   Leviticus 26:1

   1. Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a
   standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
   land, to bow down unto it: for: I am the LORD your God.

   1. Non facietis vobis idolum, et sculptile: statuam non erigetis vobis,
   nec lapidem politum ponetis in terra vestra, ut vos incurvetis coram
   eo: quia ego Jehova Deus rester.


   Exodus 20

   Exodus 20:22, 23

   22. And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children
   of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

   22. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Sic dices filiis Israel, Vos vidistis quod
   e coelis loquutus sum vobiscum.

   23. Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make
   unto you gods of gold.

   23. Non facietis mecum deos ar- gentcos, neque deos aureos fadetis
   vobis.


   Exodus 34:17. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. When he calls graven
   things, statues, and pictures, by the name of gods, he shews the object
   and sum of the Second Commandment, viz., that God is insulted when He
   is clothed in a corporeal image. Moreover, the name of God is
   transferred to idols, according to common parlance, and the corrupt
   opinion of the Gentiles; not that unbelievers thought that the Deity
   was included in the corruptible material, but because they imagined
   that it was nearer to them, if some earthly symbol of its presence were
   standing before their eyes. In this sense, they called the images of
   the gods their gods; because they thought they could not ascend to the
   heights in which the Deity dwelt, unless they mounted by these earthly
   aids. There is no doubt but that he comprehends by synecdoche, all
   kinds of images, when he forbids the making of molten gods; because
   metal is no more abominated by God than wood, or stone, or any other
   material, out of which idols are usually made; but, inasmuch as the
   insane zeal of superstition is the more inflamed by the value of the
   material or the beauty of the workmanship, Moses especially condemned
   molten gods. All question on this point is removed by the fourth
   passage here cited, wherein the Israelites are forbidden to make gods
   of silver or gold, viz., because idolaters indulge themselves more
   fully in their worship of very precious idols, by the external splendor
   of which all their senses are ravished. To the same effect is the third
   passage, in which mention is not, only made of graven images, but there
   is also added the name of a statue [89] or figured stone; for, although
   some expound these words as referring to a pavement, yet I have no
   doubt but that all monuments are included in them, wherein foolish men
   think that they have God in some measure visible, and therefore that
   they express all sculptures and pictures by which the spiritual worship
   of God is corrupted. For the object of Moses is to restrain the
   rashness of men, lest they should travesty God's glory by their
   imaginations; for another clause is immediately added, "I am the Lord
   your God," in which God reminds them that He is despoiled of His due
   honor, whenever men devise anything earthly or carnal respecting Him.
   The word mtsvh, [90] matsebah, is sometimes used in a good sense;
   whence it follows, that no other statues are here condemned, except
   those which are erected as representations of God. The same also is the
   case as to the polished stone, [91] viz., when it receives a
   consecration, which may attract men's minds to regard it in a religious
   light, so as to worship God in the stone. But both in the second and
   third passages, Moses teaches men that as soon as they imagine anything
   gross or terrestrial in the deity, they altogether depart from the true
   God. And this is also expressed in the word 'lylym, elilim, which
   embraces in it statues, stones, and graven images, as well as molten
   gods. Some think that this word is compounded of 'l, al [92] the
   negative particle, and 'l, el, God. Others translate it "a thing of
   nought;" the Greeks and Latins have rendered it "idols." It is plain,
   that the false representations, which travesty God, are so called to
   mark them with disgrace and ignominy. But, since the superstitious
   cease not to gloss over their errors with cavils, God is not content
   with this opprobrious name, but adds others also, respecting which
   their pretext was more specious; that we may know that whatsoever
   withdraws us from His spiritual service, or whatsoever men introduce
   alien from His nature, is repudiated by Him. In the fourth passage, the
   antithesis must be noted, which will presently be explained more fully,
   viz., when God forbids them to make gods of corruptible materials,
   since He has "spoken from heaven;" in which words He signifies that all
   are doing wrong, who, when they ought to look up to heaven, tie down
   their own minds as well as Him to earthly elements.

   [89] A.V. "a standing image." Margin, "pillar:" or "image of stone."
   Margin, "figured stone, Heb. a stone of picture."

   pillar, and where the narrative shews that no idolatry was meant. -- W.

   [91] mskyt C polished. S.M., figured. AV, image of stone, and in. the

   interpreters, who explain the root skh as meaning to imagine; and the

   form an obscure resemblance. Hence in Simon's Lexicon, the words 'vn

   weak either in body or mind, and is therefore a fit epithet for
   designating idols. -- W

   Deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:12-19, 23, 24

   12. And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
   the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.

   12. Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad vos e medio ignis: vocem verborum
   audistis, at formam non vidistis praeter vocem.

   13. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
   perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
   stone.

   13. Et exposuit vobis pactum suum quod praecepit vobis ut faceretis:
   nempe decem verba, quae scrip-sit super duas tabulas lapideas.

   14. And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
   judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
   possess it.

   14. Mihi praecepit Jehova tempore illo ut docerem vos statuta et
   judicia, quae faceretis in terra, ad quam transitis possidendam.

   15. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
   of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of
   the midst of the fire:

   15. Itaque custodiatis vos valde super animabus vestris: (quoniam non
   vidistis ullam formam illo die, quo loquutus est Jehova vobiscum in
   Horeb e medio ignis:)

   16. Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
   similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

   16. Ne forte corrumpamini, et faciatis vobis sculptile, formam ullius
   simulachri, effigiem masculi aut foeminae.

   17. The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any
   winged fowl that flieth in the air,

   17. Effigiem cujusque animalis quod est in terra: effigiem cujuscunque
   volucris alatae quae volat per coelos:

   18. The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness
   of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

   18. Effigiem cujuscunque repentis in terra: effigiem cujuscunque piscis
   qui est in aquis sub terra.

   19. And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest
   the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,
   shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy
   God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

   19. Neve attollas oculos tuos in coelum: et quum videris solem, lunam,
   et stellas cum universo exercitu coelorum, impellaris ut adores atque
   colas ea, quae distribuit Jehova Deus tuus omnibus populis sub universo
   coelo.

   23. Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD
   your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the
   likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.

   23. Custodite vos, ne forte obliviscamini foederis Jehovae Dei vestri,
   quod percussit vobiscum, et faciatis vobis sculptlie, quamcunque
   simili-tudinem, sicut praecepit Jehova Deus tuus.

   24. For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

   24. Nam Jehova Deus tuus, ignis consumens est, et Deus zelotes.


   Exodus 34

   Exodus 34:14

   14. For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is
   Jealous, is a jealous God:

   14. Non incurvabis te Deo alieno. Nam Jehova zelotes nomen ejus, Deus
   zelotes est.


   Deuteronomy 8

   Deuteronomy 8:19, 20

   19. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and
   walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
   against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

   19. Si obliviscendo oblitus fueris Jehovae Dei tui, et ambulaveris post
   deos alienos, et colueris eos, et te in-curvaveris illis, testificor
   vobis hodie quod pereundi sitis perituri.

   20. As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall
   ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD
   your God.

   20. Sicut gentes quas Jehova disperdit a facie vestra, sic peribitis:
   eo quod non obediveris voci Jehovec Dei vestri.


   Deuteronomy 4:12. And the Lord spake unto you. It is a confirmation of
   the Second Commandment, that God manifested Himself to the Israelites
   by a voice, and not in a bodily form; whence it follows that those who
   are not contented with His voice, but seek His visible form, substitute
   imaginations and phantoms in His place. But here arises a difficult
   question, for God made Himself known to the patriarchs in other ways
   besides by His voice alone; thus Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew Him not
   only by hearing, but by sight. Moses himself saw Him in the midst of
   the burning bush; and He also manifested Himself to the Prophets under
   visible figures. Since it would be superfluous to heap together many
   citations, let the remarkable vision of Isaiah suffice, which is
   related in (Isaiah 6), and those of Ezekiel, which we read of in
   (Ezekiel 1 and Ezekiel 10) And yet God was not forgetful of Himself,
   when He thus presented Himself to the sight of His servants. Wherefore,
   this argument does not appear to be valid and good, that it is sinful
   to represent God in a visible image, because His voice was once heard
   without His being seen; when, on the other side, it is easy to object
   that visible forms have often been exhibited, wherein He testified His
   presence. The solution is twofold: first, that, although God may have
   invested Himself in certain forms for the purpose of manifesting
   Himself, this must be accounted as a peculiar circumstance, and not be
   taken as a general rule; secondly, that the visions shewn to the
   patriarchs were testimonies of His invisible glory, rather to elevate
   men's minds to things above than to keep them entangled amongst earthly
   elements. In the promulgation of His Law, God first prescribed what
   believers must follow; because He saw that this was the best method
   (compendium) for retaining the minds of His people in true religion,
   and at the same time the best remedy for idolatry. Unless we submit to
   this counsel of God, we shall not only betray a licentious spirit of
   contention, but shall run directly against God, like butting bulls. For
   it was not in vain that Moses laid down this principle, that when God
   collected to Himself a Church, and handed down a certain and inviolable
   rule for holy living, He had not invested Himself in a bodily shape,
   but had exhibited the living image of His glory in the doctrine itself.
   Hence we may conclude that all those who seek for God in a visible
   figure, not only decline, but actually revolt, from the true study of
   piety.

   If any one should object that God is not inconsistent with Himself, and
   yet, as has been said, that He has more than once taken upon Himself a
   visible form, the reply is simple and easy, that, whenever He appeared
   to the patriarchs in a visible form, He gave a temporary sign, which
   still was by no means contradictory of this commandment. Isaiah saw the
   Lord of hosts sitting on His throne; yet he boldly cries out as from
   the mouth of God, "To whom will ye liken me?" (Isaiah 40:25.) Nor need
   I repeat how constantly he speaks against idolaters; certainly he
   inveighs more strongly than any of the prophets against the folly, nay,
   the madness of those who make to themselves any image of God; because
   they thus turn truth into falsehood; and finally he assumes the same
   principle as that of Moses, that the true nature of God is corrupted by
   tricks and delusions if a corruptible thing be called His image. But
   what was His vision itself? The seraphim, who surrounded God's throne,
   sufficiently shewed by their covering their faces with their wings that
   the sight of Him could not be borne by mortals. As to what Ezekiel
   relates, no painter could represent it; for God has always appeared
   distinguished from the shape of any creature by those marks which
   surpass man's apprehension. This conclusion, therefore, always remains
   sure, that no image is suitable to God, because He would not be
   perceived by His people otherwise than in a voice. But then also fire
   was a symbol of His presence, yet He testified by it that His glory is
   incomprehensible, and thus would prevent men from idol-making. We have
   elsewhere explained what it is "to guard themselves as to their souls."
   [93] But we infer, from his anxious exhortations, that they should take
   heed, how great is the leaning of the human soul to idolatry. This is
   the tendency of that attestation against them, which I have inserted
   from (Deuteronomy 8); for Moses not only threatens them, but, as if
   summoning witnesses according to the custom of solemn trials, denounces
   that they shall perish, in order to inspire them with greater fear by
   this earnest mode of address. Whence it appears that this insane lust
   (of idolatry) is not to be repressed by ordinary means. With the same
   object he says that they are "corrupted, or corrupt themselves," who
   make any similitude of God. Thus Paul also declares that in this way
   the truth is changed into a lie, (Romans 1:25;) and Jeremiah and
   Habakkuk condemn images for their falsehood. (Jeremiah 10:14; Habakkuk
   2:18.) No wonder, then, that an idol should be called the "corruption"
   of men, since it adulterates the worship of God; and it is a most just
   recompense to those who pollute the pure and perfect knowledge of God,
   that they should be thence infected with a rottenness which consumes
   their souls. Hence, also, the stupid ignorance of the Papists is
   confuted who confine this prohibition to the ancient people, as if it
   were now permitted to paint or to sculpture (images of God) [94] as if
   they had been Jews whom Paul was addressing, when he reasoned from the
   common origin of our nature: "Forasmuch as we are the offspring of God,
   we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver," or
   corruptible matter. (Acts 17:29) [95] There is no necessity for
   entering into details; but the Spirit declares no less plainly now that
   we must keep ourselves from idols, (1 John 5:21,) than He of old
   forbade their being made. Moreover, it was an act of diabolical madness
   to make away with one of the Ten Commandments, in order that they might
   rush into this foul and detestable extravagance with impunity. They
   pretend that the Jews were formerly prohibited from idolatry with
   greater strictness, because they were too much disposed to it, as if
   they were not themselves much worse in this respect. But, setting aside
   this, who does not see that the vice of superstition, which is natural
   to the human mind, was corrected by this remedy? Until, therefore, men
   have laid aside their nature, we infer that this Commandment is
   necessary for them.

   19. And lest thou lift up thine eyes. Moses proceeds further, lest the
   Jews should imagine any divinity in the sun, and moon, and stars; nor
   does he only recall them from the error with which many were imbued,
   [96] thinking that these were so many gods; but also anticipates
   another superstition, lest, being ravished by the brightness of the
   stars, they should conceive them to be images of God. And to this the
   expression, to "be driven," refers. For since God represents His glory
   in the heavenly host, so also Satan, under this pretext, confuses and
   stupefies men's minds by a wily artifice, in order that they may
   worship God in these luminaries, and thus stumble at the very
   threshold. Therefore, that the Israelites may the better acknowledge
   how absurd it is to seek for God in earthly things, or in the elements
   of the world, or in corruptible matter, he expressly declares that they
   must not even lean [97] on heavenly creatures; since God's majesty is
   superior to the sun, and moon, and all the stars. Besides, he reproves
   the absurdity of transferring the worship of God to the stars, which,
   by God's appointment, are to minister to us; for when he says that "God
   hath divided them unto all nations," it implies subjection; as if he
   had said that the sun was our minister, and the moon, together with all
   the stars, our handmaid. Still, by the word "divided," God's admirable
   providence is fitly commended in respect to their varied position, and
   course, and different offices; for the sun does not enlighten and warm
   all lands at the same moment; and, again, it now retires from us, and
   now approaches us more closely; the moon has her circuits; the stars
   rise and set as the heaven revolves. I pass over the slower movement of
   the planets; but, according to the aspect of the stars, one climate is
   moister, another drier; one feels more heat, another more cold. This
   variety is aptly called by Moses "dividing " Yet it aggravates the sin
   of superstition, if the Jews give themselves to the service of the
   stars, which minister also to heathen nations; for what can be more
   unworthy than for the children of God to worship the sun, which is the
   servant of all the world? whence again it follows, that in proportion
   to the dignity and excellence of the creatures themselves, so is the
   ingratitude of men towards God all the more base, if they adorn with
   His worship as with spoils, those creatures which He has appointed to
   minister to their advantage. The silly notion in which some of the
   Rabbins delight themselves, [98] is unworthy of mention, viz., that God
   has divided the stars to the Gentiles, since they are subject to their
   influences, from which by special privilege the Jews are free; as if
   the condition of the human race had not been the same from the
   beginning. But the reason which I have adduced plainly shews, that they
   depart most widely from the meaning of Moses, and therefore pervert his
   intention; viz., that the creatures which are destined for our use, are
   by no means to be worshipped as God.

   23. Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget. There is no
   contradiction in the sense, that he should first of all altogether
   forbid that idols should be made; and, secondly, speak only of
   worshipping and adoring them; for it is already in itself a wicked
   error to attribute any image to God; and another superstition always
   accompanies it, that God is always improperly worshipped in this
   visible symbol. There is a strong confirmation here of what I have
   previously stated, that whatever holds down and confines our senses to
   the earth, is contrary to the covenant of God; in which, inviting us to
   Himself, He permits us to think of nothing but what is spiritual, and
   therefore sets His voice against all the imaginations, whereby heathen
   nations have always been deceived; because they have been deprived of
   the light of that doctrine which would direct them to the heavenly
   greatness of God Himself. But those who have been taught by God's Law,
   not only that He alone is to be worshipped, but that He may not be
   represented by any visible effigy, are justly accounted
   covenant-breakers, if they do not confine themselves within these
   bounds; for they violate that Second Commandment (caput) by which they
   are commanded to worship God spiritually; and consequently are
   forbidden to make to themselves likenesses, or images, whereby they
   would deface and pollute His glory. At the end of the verse, which some
   translate "the likeness, which your God hath forbidden," [99] the
   proper rendering is, "hath commanded, or enjoined:" and hence the
   relative 'vr, asher, must be taken, as in many other places, as an
   adverb of comparison. The meaning of Moses is indeed by no means
   obscure; viz., that we must simply obey God's word; and that we must
   not dispute whether what He has forbidden is lawful or not; and that no
   other rule of right is to be sought for, except that we should follow
   what He has prescribed. Let the Papists dispute as they please, that
   images are not to be removed because they are useful for the people's
   instruction; but let this be our wisdom, to acquiesce in what God has
   chosen to decree in this matter. Although the threat which is subjoined
   might have been placed amongst the sanctions, which we shall hereafter
   consider in their proper place, yet I have been unwilling to separate
   it from the Second Commandment, to which it is annexed. A confirmation
   is added in Deuteronomy; viz., that God, who has not spared foreign
   nations, will much less pardon His people; inasnmch as it is a greater
   crime, and fouler ingratitude to forsake God when once He is known, and
   to cast aside the teaching of His Law, than to follow errors handed
   down from our forefathers. I have already explained in what sense He is
   called a "jealous God;" but in Exodus 34:14, Moses has not deemed it
   sufficient simply to honor God with this title; but, in amplification,
   he has added that this is His name, in order that we may know that He
   can no more bear a companion, or a rival, to be compared with Him, than
   He can cast away His Godhead, or deny Himself. He compares Him to fire,
   to increase our terror of Him. We know how audaciously the world
   indulges itself in superstitions; so that, as if in very sport, it
   metamorphoses God just as fancy leads. Wherefore, in order to incline
   men's minds to reverence, he sets before us in this figure God's
   fearful vengeance; as though He would instantly consume them, just as
   fire consumes stubble, if they shall have dared to think of God
   otherwise than is right.

   Deuteronomy 11

   Deuteronomy 11:16, 17

   16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye
   turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

   16. Cavete ergo vobis ne seducatur cor vestrum, et recedatis,
   colatisque deos alienos, et vos incurvetis coram eis.

   17. And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up
   the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her
   fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD
   giveth you.

   17. Unde excandescat ira Jehovae in vos, et claudat coelos ne sit
   pluvia, ac ne det terra fructum suum: pere-atisque celeriter e terra
   bona quam Jehova dat vobis.


   16 Take heed to yourselves. By often inculcating the same thing, viz.,
   that they should diligently take heed, he indirectly arraigns man's
   proneness to superstition; and this too is again expressed in the
   words, "that your heart be not deceived;" for by them he signifies,
   that unless they take diligent heed to themselves, nothing will be more
   easy than for them to fall into the snares of Satan. Wherefore the
   impudence of the Papists is the less excusable, who intoxicate their
   own and others' minds with security, when God constantly exhorts them
   to solicitude. Let us learn, then, that since many impostures and
   deceits besiege us on every side, we shall in the vanity of our nature
   be liable immediately to fall into them, unless we carefully guard
   ourselves. By the expression "turn aside," he implies what has been
   before said, that whosoever declines to corrupted worship, impiously
   falls away from the true God. Unbelievers but little think so, for with
   them it is a light transgression to exceed in this respect; and they
   would wilfully blind the eyes of God with their inventions (commentis),
   nay, there is nothing too silly for them to desire to be approved of,
   and sanctioned by God. But if it be objected that obedience is better
   than sacrifice, they shield themselves under the cover of their good
   intention, as if God were not at liberty to repudiate what they
   foolishly obtrude upon Him. At any rate, they so pertinaciously indulge
   themselves in their inconsiderate zeal, that they will hardly
   acknowledge the slightest fault in it. But, on the other side, God
   declares that all are apostates who do not confine themselves to the
   simplicity of the Law. A threat is again added, that God will avenge
   the violation of His worship, and will curse their land, until He shall
   destroy them by dearth and famine; and, finally, He pronounces that
   they shall perish off that land which God had promised them to the end
   that He might be there purely worshipped.

   Deuteronomy 16:22

   22. Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God
   hateth.

   22. Non eriges tibi statuam: quod odio habet Jehova Deus tuus.


   22. Neither shalt thou set thee up. Hence also it more clearly appears
   what is the meaning and tendency of the Second Commandment. God
   elsewhere commands, [100] (as we have seen,) that statues [101] should
   be erected on the borders of the land, on which the sum of the Law
   should be inscribed. At first sight this prohibition seems to be
   contradictory; and indeed it would be so, unless you understand
   "statue" to be a false image of God, in which men set Him before them
   in bodily form; and, therefore, it is added, that He hates such
   statues. But I have preferred translating [102] the relative in the
   neuter gender, that the sentence might be fuller; i.e., that the
   erecting of statues is an abomination to the Lord; because in this way
   His glory is dishonored, when He is transfigured into a body, or when
   anything corporeal is mixed with His spiritual nature.

   24. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after
   their works: ...

   24. Non adorabis deos eorum, neque coles eos, neque facies secundum
   opera eorum.


   24. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods. Moses repeats what had been
   before said, that the worship of God must be separated from all the
   superstitions of the Gentiles; for this error has been everywhere rife,
   that unbelievers would rather draw down God to themselves on earth,
   than ascend above to seek for Him. And in this sense we have said that
   idols are called gods; because it is impossible but that he who would
   represent God by wood and stone, should associate Him with corruptible
   matter. Experience also teaches us, that all the wicked are so attached
   to their idols, that they gain nothing by their subterfuge, when they
   allege that this is a necessary help to their ignorance. The following
   clause, "nor do after their works," sufficiently proves that all
   corrupt worship is comprehended under the term idolatry.

   Deuteronomy 12

   Deuteronomy 12:4-14, 17, 18, 26, 27

   4. Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

   4. Non facietis sic Jehovae Deo vestro.

   5. But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all
   your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye
   seek, and thither thou shalt come:

   5. Sed locum quem elegerit Jehova Deus vester e cunctis tribubus
   vestris, ut ponat illic nomen suum ad habitandum, quaretis, veniesque
   illuc.

   6. And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
   sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your
   vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and
   of your flocks:

   6. Et afferetis illuc holocausta vestra, sacrificia vestra, decimas
   vestras, levationem manus vestrae, vota vestra, spontaneas oblationes
   vestras, primogenita armentorum vestrorum, et pecudum vestrarum.

   7. And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
   rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households,
   wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

   7. Comedetisque in conspectu Jehovae Dei vestri, et laetabimini in omni
   applicatione manus vestrae, vos et domus vestrae quibus benedixerit
   Jehova Deus tuus.

   8. Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every
   man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

   8. Non facietis secundum omnia quae nos hodie hic facimus, unusquisque
   quod rectum est in oculis suis.

   9. For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which
   the LORD your God giveth you.

   9. Quia non venistis adhuc ad requiem et haereditatem quam Jehova Deus
   tuus dat tibi.

   10. But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD
   your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all
   your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

   10. Quum vero transieritis Jordanem, et habitabitis in terra quam
   Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi possiden-dam, et requiem dederit vobis ab
   omnibus inimicis vestris in cireuitu, et habitabitis secure.

   11. Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to
   cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I
   command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes,
   and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye
   vow unto the LORD:

   11. Tune ad locum quem elegerit Jehova Deus vester, ut in eo habitare
   faciat nomen suum, adducetis omnia quae ego praecipio vobis,
   holo-causta vestra, sacrificia vestra, decimas vestras, elevationem
   manus vestrae, et omnem delectum votorum vestrorum quae vovebitis.

   12. And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons,
   and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and
   the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor
   inheritance with you.

   12. Et laetabimini coram Jehova Deo vestro, vos et filii vestri, et
   filiae vestrae, servi vestri et ancillae vestrae: Levita quoque qui
   erit intra portas vestras: quia non habebit partem et haereditatem
   vobis-cum.

   13. Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
   every place that thou seest:

   13. Cave tibi ne forte offeras holocausta tua in quovis loco quem
   conspexeris:

   14. But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes,
   there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all
   that I command thee.

   14. Sed in loco quem elegerit Jehova in una tribuum tuarum, illic
   offeres holocausta tua, et illic facies quae ego praecipio tibi.

   17. Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of
   thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
   flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill
   offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

   17. Non poteris comedere in portis tuis decimam frumenti tui, vini tui,
   et olei tui, neque primogenita armentorum tuorum et pecudum tuarum, et
   onmia vota tua quae voveris, et spontanea tua, et elevationem manus
   tuae.

   18. But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which
   the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and
   thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy
   gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou
   puttest thine hands unto.

   18. Sed coram Jehova Deo tuo comedes illa in loco quem elegerit Jehova
   Deus tuus, tu et filius tuus, et filia tua, servus tuus, et ancilla
   tua, et Levita qui erit intra portas tuas: laetaberisque coram Jehova
   Deo tuo in omni applicatione manuum tuarum.

   26. Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
   take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose.

   26. Sanctificata tua quae fuerint tibi et vota tua tolles, ut venias ad
   locum quem elegerit Jehova:

   27. And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
   upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices
   shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
   eat the flesh.

   27. Et facies holocausta tua ex carne et sanguine super altare Jehovae
   Dei tui, sanguis autem sacrificiorum tuorum fundetur super altare Dei
   tui, carnes vero comedes.


   4 Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God. The principal distinction,
   as far as regards the external exercises of devotion, is here laid down
   between the legitimate worship of God, and all the fictitious rites
   which the Gentiles have invented; viz., that God would have but one
   sanctuary and one altar, which might be a symbol of the difference
   between Himself and all idols; and thus that true religion should have
   no affinity to superstitions. To this refers the prohibition, that the
   Israelites should not conduct themselves towards God as the Gentiles
   did towards their idols; but that a barrier should be raised, which
   would separate [103] them from the whole world. The whole external
   profession of God's worship is fitly annexed to the Second Commandment,
   because upon that it depends, and has no other object than its due
   observation. But when I begin to speak of the tabernacle, the
   priesthood, and the sacrifices, I am entering on a deep and vast ocean,
   in which many interpreters, whilst indulging their curiosity, have
   pursued a wild and wandering course. Admonished, therefore, by their
   example, I will take in my sails, and only touch upon a few points
   which tend to edification in the faith. But my readers must now be
   requested, not only to pardon me for abstaining from subtle
   speculations, but also themselves willingly to keep within the bounds
   of simplicity. Many have itching ears; and in our natural vanity, most
   men are more delighted by foolish allegories, than by solid erudition.
   But let those who shall desire to profit in God's school, learn to
   restrain this perverse desire of knowing more than is good for them,
   although it may tickle their minds. Now let us consider the words of
   Moses.

   5 But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose. It is asked
   why God would have sacrifices offered to Him only on one altar? Besides
   the reason which I have lately advanced, it is not to be doubted but
   that He in this way had regard to believers, that He might cherish in
   them an agreement in the unity of the faith. This place, then, was like
   a standard to gather together the people, lest their religion should be
   torn by divisions, and lest any diversities should insinuate
   themselves. Moreover, God, by claiming His right and authority to
   choose the place, commends obedience, on which also the purity of
   worship depends. But, again, another question arises; because, before
   the time of David, the Ark had nowhere a fixed resting-place, but
   traveled about, as it were, to various lodgings, therefore, if the
   chosen place is understood to be Mount Zion, the people were free in
   the intermediate time to perform the sacrifices wherever they pleased.
   I reply, that the place was not, chosen until the Ark was placed in
   Zion; for not till then was fulfilled what is said in the Psalm,

   "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the
   Lord;
   our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem,"
   (Psalm 122:1-2;)

   in which words the Prophet intimates that there was before no
   resting-place, because God had not yet pointed out the place in which
   He would be worshipped. Therefore it is expressly said, "out of all
   your tribes," or "in one of your tribes," whereby a special privilege
   is referred to, which was to be conferred on one of their tribes, to
   the exclusion of the others. And to this relates what is said in
   another Psalm,

   "Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe
   of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he
   loved: and he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth,
   which he hath established for ever."
   (Psalm 78:67-69 )

   To the same effect the faithful elsewhere congratulate themselves,
   after the Ark was deposited with David, "We will go into his
   tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool;" and, on the other hand,
   the Spirit declares,

   "The Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This
   is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it " (Psalm
   132:13-14.)

   Similar statements everywhere occur, confirming the opinion that the
   Ark never rested in its true home until it was deposited on Zion; and
   God, in my judgment, in order that He might keep the hope of His people
   in suspense, promised, although the Ark changed its place from time to
   time, that He had still determined on a perpetual abode in which it
   should rest. Yet it does not therefore follow that, up to that period,
   a free permission was given to the people to sacrifice wherever they
   would. For, wherever the sanctuary was, there was also a temporary
   choice of the place, until the legitimate resting-place was shewn them.
   Therefore God, chastising by Jeremiah the foolish confidence by which
   the Jews were puffed up, said,

   "Go ye now unto my place, which was in Shiloh,
   and see what I did to it," etc., (Jeremiah 7:12;)

   in which words he implies that Shiloh had been highly honored for a
   season, but had now been deprived of its honor, because the sacrifices
   had there been unworthily polluted.

   Although, then, there is a special promise here concerning Zion, still
   there is no doubt but that God in the meantime confines the Jews to His
   sanctuary, lest any one should erect a private altar for himself, or
   build for himself other cities and other temples. The phrase is worthy
   of observation, "to put his name there;" and again, "his habitation."
   The gross imaginations of men are thus obviated, lest the people should
   enclose God within walls, as they are wont to circumscribe His infinite
   essence, or to draw Him down from heaven, and to place Him beneath the
   elements of the world. But God's name is said to inhabit a place, not
   in His own nature, but with reference to man; whilst, in deference to
   their ignorance, He sets before their eyes a visible symbol of His
   presence. Thus He is often said to "come down," not as if He, who fills
   heaven and earth, actually moved, but because the familiar knowledge of
   Him brings Him near to men. But although He allows Himself to be
   invoked on earth, yet He would not have the minds of men rest there,
   but rather lifts them up on high as if by steps. Therefore, by Isaiah,
   He harshly chides them, because, although enwrapped in their sins, they
   still thought that He was under obligation to them because His temple
   was in their sight, (Isaiah 66:1,) whereas it is our business to
   approach Him by faith and with serious feelings when He extends His
   hand to us. The Ark of the Covenant indeed is often called "His face;"
   but, lest men should form any gross or earthly conceptions of Him, the
   sanctuary is also called "His footstool."

   The various kinds of oblations which are here enumerated will be
   hereafter more clearly explained. I will only briefly remind you that
   the burnt-offerings are included in the sacrifices, as a part is taken
   for the whole. The Hebrew word, which we have translated "the elevating
   of the hand," is, trvmh, therumah, [104] to which another word, tnvphh,
   thenuphah, is often added; but, although both are derived from the act
   of elevating, still they seem to differ, and those skilled in the
   language thus distinguish them, viz., that trvmh, therumah, is to be
   lifted up, and then brought down; and, tnvphh, thanuphah, to be turned
   at the same time to the right and left, although others think it means
   to be turned round to the four quarters of the globe. There is a
   difference between vows and freewill-offerings; for although a vow is
   at first freely made, yet we may offer things which we have not vowed.
   I have already spoken of the firstlings.

   7 And there shall ye eat. We see that the sanctuary in which God
   manifested Himself is called His face; [105] for, although believers
   are taught that always, wherever they dwell, they walk before God; yet
   they placed themselves nearer, and in some special manner in His sight,
   when they approached His sanctuary. By this mode of speaking God also
   stimulates the laziness or tardiness of the people, lest it should be
   irksome to them to come to the Ark of the Covenant for the purpose of
   sacrificing, inasmuch as this inestimable benefit would compensate for
   the labor and expense of the journey. I have elsewhere shewn that, when
   men are said to feast before the Lord, sacred feasts are thus
   distinguished from our daily meals. For this was as it were an
   accessory to the sacrifices, to eat what remained of the victims; and
   in this way the guests were made partakers of the offering, which
   custom even heathen nations imitated, though improperly. Again, God
   kindly invites them when He says, "ye shall rejoice in all that thou
   puttest thine hands unto," for which some translate it, "in everything
   to which you shall have sent your hand;" literally it is, "in the
   sending forth of the land." There is no ambiguity in the sense, for it
   refers to those works which require the motion and application of the
   hands. A little below, where I have translated it, "which he hath
   blessed," (quibus benedixerit,) some insert the proposition in, and
   supply the pronoun you, (i.e., in which he hath blessed you;) but it is
   quite appropriate to say, that God blesses their works, although it may
   be understood of their families also. As to the command that the tithes
   should be eaten in the holy place, I do not extend it to tithes in
   general, [106] for it was hardly probable that the food of those who
   were dispersed through various cities should be transferred to another
   place, so that they would perish (at home) [107] from hunger; but I
   understand it of the second tithes, which the Levites separated to be a
   special and peculiar oblation; for we shall see elsewhere that what
   remained over passed into the nature of ordinary produce, as if the
   Levites ate of the fruits of their own possessions.

   8 Ye shall not do after all. Even then they observed the rite of
   sacrifice handed down to them from the fathers; but since as yet they
   were wandering in the desert, it was lawful for them to build altars
   anywhere, until an end should be put to their journeyings. And this
   Moses expressly declares, adding the reason, viz., that they had not
   yet entered into the rest which the Lord had promised them. He shews
   them, then, that when they shall have attained the tranquil possession
   of the land, there would be no further room for excuse if they should
   sacrifice wheresoever it pleased them. When, therefore, it is said that
   they then did "every man whatsoever was right in his own eyes," it does
   not extend to any of the inventions which men devise for themselves in
   the worship of God, but only points out a freer system and form in the
   exercise of devotion, before the place was shewn them in which they
   must stay their foot. [108]

   10. But when ye go over Jordan. This verse confirms what I have before
   said, that the Jews were constrained to a certain rule as soon as they
   should have reached the promised land; and yet that the place in which
   the Ark was perpetually to rest, would not be immediately manifested to
   them; for what is declared at the end of the verse, that God would give
   them rest round about, so that they should dwell in safety, was not in
   fact perfectly exhibited before the time of David. Still God would have
   them, as soon as they were in enjoyment of the land, come together even
   from their remotest boundaries to the sanctuary. He omits certain kinds
   of offerings of which he had lately spoken, and puts, instead of
   "vows," [109] "the choice vows," which some translate "very choice
   vows," or "the chief things in your vows." I do not reject this; but
   the other sense is more simple, that all the vows were comprised which
   every one had made of his own free judgment and choice. Soon afterwards
   he more fully expresses his meaning, when he prohibits them from
   offering sacrifices of their own accord in any places that might please
   them; for, "to see a place," here, is equivalent to being carried away
   by the sight, so as to connect religion and holiness with elegance and
   beauty.

   26 Only thy holy things. This passage more clearly explains what was
   meant by the foregoing precepts, viz., that but one place was set apart
   for the performance of their sacred rites, lest, if each should offer
   wherever it pleased him, religion should be corrupted, and by degrees
   the various altars should beget as many gods. He therefore commands
   that all the victims should be sacrificed on one altar, with a
   provision that the blood should be poured out.

   Deuteronomy 14

   Deuteronomy 14:23-26

   23. And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he
   shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy
   wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy
   flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.

   23. Et comedes coram Jehova Deo tuo in loco quem elegerit ut habitare
   faciat nomen suum ibi, decimam frumenti tui, vini tui, et olei tui, et
   primogenita boum tuorum, et pecudum tuarum: ut discas timere Jehovam
   Deum tuum omnibus diebus.

   24. And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to
   carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God
   shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed
   thee:

   24. Quod si longior fuerit via quam ut per eam ferre possis illas, quod
   distet a te locus ille quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus ut ponat nomen
   suum ibi, quum benedixerit tibi Jehova Deus tuus:

   25. Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine
   hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:

   25. Tunc dabis pro pecunia, et colligabis pecuniam in manu tua, et ibis
   ad locum quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus:

   26. And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth
   after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for
   whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD
   thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,

   26. Et dabis pecuniam pro omni eo quod desiderat anima tua, pro bobus,
   et pro ovibus, et pro vino, et pro sicera, et pro cunctis denique quae
   postulaverit a te anima tua: et comedes ibi coram Jehova Deo tuo, et
   laetaberis tu et domus tua.


   23. And thou shalt eat before the Lord. He again commands the victims
   to be brought into the place of the sanctuary; although by the place
   which God shall choose, he designates Jerusalem, as has been said in
   the above commentary on [10]chap. 12; for the Ark of the Covenant had
   no settled resting-place until the time of David, but was received as
   it were in temporary lodgings. Moses, therefore, now commands, that
   when God shall have so greatly honored a particular place, and shall
   have chosen a perpetual rest, in which His name shall dwell, thither
   are the offerings to be brought. But we know that this place was
   Jerusalem; and all the oblations were restricted to this one place,
   lest any corruption should creep in to destroy the unity of the faith.
   For all strange inventions, as has already been sufficiently seen, are
   so many profanations of God's worship. But, whereas in chap. 12, Moses
   had promiscuously joined the tithes with the firstlings, and had made
   the same appointment with respect to both, he now relaxes the
   stringency of that law, by adding an exception, viz, that if the way
   should be too long, a commutation might be made, and money might be
   paid instead of corn. He does not, indeed, speak only of the tithes,
   but unites with them the vows and free-gifts; nay, he refers properly
   to these alone. But, since as to the latter there is no question, let
   us only consider whether it was consistent that the tithes should be
   paid in one place alone. They were given to the Levites for their
   maintenance, who, as is well known, were dispersed throughout the whole
   land; either then their residence must have been fixed at Jerusalem, or
   they must not be deprived of their subsistence, wherever they might
   dwell. The command, therefore, appears to be absurd, that all the
   tithes of the whole land should be brought to Jerusalem, for that would
   have amounted to nothing less than to destroy the poor Levites by
   famine. This absurdity has compelled the commentators to fabricate a
   doubtful conjecture; viz., that the people voluntarily set apart
   certain tithes, which they might carry to Jerusalem at the festivals;
   but it is not probable that so heavy a burden was imposed upon them,
   [110] as that they should only keep at home what remained of the fifth
   part. But a nearer approach to probability would be, that the tithes of
   the neighboring country, as convenience offered, were carried to
   Jerusalem; whilst those which were collected in more distant places
   were set aside there; but that they were accounted for at Jerusalem, so
   that upon a calculation of the number of their families, an equal
   distribution might be made to the Levites. Certainly it is by no means
   probable that the respective tillers of the soil carried up to
   Jerusalem what the Levites, having received there, were compelled to
   take back again for the maintenance of their families; for what would
   have been the advantage of all this expense and trouble of carrying
   them backwards and forwards? Besides, it would have been useless to
   command the Levites, and that too with the addition of severe threats,
   to pay the priests faithfully, if the tithes had been first deposited
   with the priests themselves, who might easily have provided against all
   deception, since they had the whole quantity of corn in their own
   hands. I have, therefore, no doubt but that the Levites collected the
   tithes each in their own neighborhood, but that another tithing, of
   which mention will be made presently, was carried up to the sanctuary
   as a sacred offering, and a profession of service to God. For we have
   lately seen, that after that part had been withdrawn, the nine parts
   which remained were assigned to the Levites, as if they had been grown
   on their own ground. But because it was a subject which might cause
   complaints, that the first-fruits and other tithes should be collected
   into one place, God would anticipate this by showing the advantage of
   it to the whole people, in that there might be food enough for all who
   should come to the celebration of the festivals; for this is the
   meaning of the words, "thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God;" as if
   it had been said, that the place should be sacred to God, to which the
   worshippers of God might come from the whole land. Yet He commands, in
   the meanwhile, the pure observation of His worship; lest a diversity of
   places might draw away the people in various directions to false
   superstitions.

   24 And if the way be too long. I am prevented from understanding this
   restriction as having reference to the tithes, by the ordinance which
   is elsewhere made, that whosoever would redeem them by a money-payment,
   (Leviticus 27:31,) should add a fifth part, and this is omitted here;
   and, again, by the explanation which is soon after added, that they
   should bring money with them instead of their offerings, and buy with
   it oxen and sheep, wine, and strong drink, as they pleased. The sum is,
   that if it were too burdensome for them to bring from their distant
   homes victims and other gifts, they were permitted to buy at Jerusalem
   whatever they chose to offer, provided they made no offerings
   elsewhere.

   Exodus 20

   Exodus 20:24, 25

   24. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
   thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and
   thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee,
   and I will bless thee.

   24. Altare terreum facies mihi, et sacrificabis super illud holocausta
   tua, et sacrificia prosperitatum tuarum, pecudes tuas, et armenta tua:
   in onmi loco in quo memoriam posuero nominis mei, veniam ad te, et
   benedicam tibi.

   25. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it
   of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted
   it.

   25. Quod si altare ex lapidibus feceris mihi, non aedificabis eos
   excisos, si gladium tuum elevaveris super illos, pollues.


   24. An altar of earth thou shalt make. This precept differs from the
   other, which I have just explained; because although it refers to the
   choice of a place, [111] yet the mention of a place is omitted, and it
   only touches upon the material and form of the altar. God, therefore,
   commands that an altar should be built to Him, either of earth or of a
   heap of stones, which had not been artificially polished. But I
   understand this of the altars, which either in the desert or elsewhere
   should be built, before the choice of the perpetual place had been
   manifested to them. God would have them built of earth, that they might
   fall down of themselves, and that no trace of them might remain after
   the departure of the people; but if stones were used, He forbade their
   being fitted together in a permanent structure, but would have them
   thrown rough and unpolished into a heap, lest their appearance should
   entice posterity to superstition. I am surprised that commentators
   [112] should here put themselves to the pains of inventing allegories;
   since God had no other object than to remove stumbling-blocks, whereby
   the Israelites might be turned away from the sanctuary; for we know how
   antiquity, and the example of our forefathers, is apt to attract the
   minds of the vulgar. If anything in the shape of an altar had remained,
   immediately religious notions would have been associated with it, that,
   God could nowhere be more solemnly or better worshipped, than in the
   place already dedicated of old by their fathers. Thus degenerate modes
   of worship would have sprung up, and the dignity of the sanctuary would
   have been brought into contempt. Wherefore this evil is anticipated
   when He forbids altars to be built which might exist for any length of
   time; and only allows them to be adapted for present use, being made of
   earth, or of an unfashioned heap of stones. As to "the sacrifices of
   prosperities,". I have elsewhere stated why I so translate the word
   slvmym, shelumim, [113] which signifies all prosperous and happy
   results; for the rendering of others, viz., peaceful things,
   (pacifica), is very unsuitable. The latter part of the verse, "in all
   places, where I record my name, I will come unto thee," has been
   ignorantly perverted by commentators, and hence has afforded a ground
   of error; for they have read it in connection with the former part, as
   if God had forbidden such an altar to be made in Mount Sion also;
   whereas He rather anticipates a doubt, which might have otherwise
   perplexed the minds of the people; Will not God be favorable to us
   where He heard the prayers of our fathers? He replies, I say, to this
   by the promise, that they will pray to Him well and duly, if they only
   obey His command, and seek no other place except that which He shall
   choose. On this score it is said, that wheresoever it shall please God
   that sacrifices should be offered, there He will descend to you, to be
   favorable unto you.

   Deuteronomy 27

   Deuteronomy 27:5-7

   5. And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar
   of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.

   5. AEdificabis in monte Ebal altare ex lapidibus Jehovae Deo tuo: non
   levabis super eos ferrum.

   6. Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones; and
   thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:

   6. E lapidibus integris aedificabis altare Jehovae Dei tui: et offeres
   super illud holocausta Jehovae Deo tuo:

   7. And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
   rejoice before the LORD thy God.

   7. Et offeres sacrificia prosperiratum, comedesque illic, ac laetaberis
   coram Jehova Deo tuo.


   5 And there shalt thou build an altar. At their first entrance into the
   land, God commands that a sacrifice of thanksgiving should be offered
   to Him; and this Joshua performed, as is related in Joshua 8:30-31

   "Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal;
   as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel,
   an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron."

   First of all, then, this testimony of their gratitude is required, that
   the children of Israel, as soon as they have begun to set foot in the
   land of Canaan, might celebrate the praises of the Lord; secondly, he
   forbids all artificial work, because, if the altar had been permanent,
   it would have been an occasion of superstition, and this exceptional
   instance would have been more regarded than the perpetual Law of God.
   Hence the nine tribes and half were so greatly wroth against the two
   tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half Manasseh, on account of the altar
   which was built on the bank of Jordan, (Joshua 22,) insomuch that they
   determined utterly to destroy their brethren, until they had cleared
   themselves by alleging that they had only built it as a memorial of
   their brotherly union, and not for sacrifice. Assuredly they were good
   expounders of the Law who accounted it an inexpiable crime, that an
   altar should be left for posterity, to withdraw the people from the one
   sanctuary, and thus to destroy the unity of faith.

   8. Et facient mihi sanctuarium, ut habitem in medio eorum.

   9. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
   tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so
   shall ye make it.

   9. Omnino ut ego ostendam tibi similitudinem habitaculi, et

   shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

   thou overlay it; and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

   angulos ejus: duos videlicet annulos in latere ejus uno, et duos
   annulos in latere ejus altero.

   gold.

   13. Facies praeterea vectes ex lignis sittim, quos cooperies auro.

   ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

   14. Inducesque vectes in annulos qui erunt in lateribus illius arcrae,
   ut illis deferetur area.

   15. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
   taken from it.

   15. In annulis illius arcae erunt vectes, non removebuntur ab ea.

   16. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give
   thee.

   16. Ponesque in arca testimonium quod dabo tibi.

   17. And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a
   half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof.

   17. Facies et operculum ex auro mundo: duorum cubitorum et dimidii erit
   longitudo ejus, cubiti vero et dimidii latitudo ejus.

   18. And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt
   thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

   18. Facies etiam duos cherubim aureos: ductiles facies eos in duabus
   extremitatibus propitiatorii.

   19. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the
   other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the

   20. And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering
   the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to
   another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

   20. Expandentque cherubim duas alas superne tegentes alis suis
   propitiatorium, et se mutuo aspicient: ad propitiatorium erunt facies
   cherubim.

   21. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the
   ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

   21. Pones autem propitiatorium super arcam superne, et in arca pones
   testimonium quod dabo tibi.

   22. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from
   above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the
   ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in
   commandment unto the children of Israel.

   22. Conveniamque tecum illuc, et loquar tecum e propitiatorio inter
   duos cherubim quod erit super arcama testimonii, quaecunque praecipiam
   tibi ad filios Israel.


   2. Speak unto the children of Israel. If any caviller should raise a
   question as to the time in which I have thought fit to introduce this
   history, [114] although I would not pertinaciously contend with him,
   still I have not only a probable, but a sure reason for my opinion. For
   it appears to me that I clearly gather from Exodus 33, that the
   tabernacle was already built before Moses brought down the first tables
   from the Mount; for it is there said, that in token of their divorce,
   in order that the people might know that they were repudiated by God,
   Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it separately for himself without
   the camp; not for his own peculiar use, because it is expressly said
   that he did not dwell there, but that he went out of the camp as often
   as he desired to consult God; whilst Joshua was its keeper and
   guardian, (aedituus.) But there is no doubt but that this took place
   previous to his second ascent to bring down new tables from the Lord;
   it is, therefore, clear that the tabernacle was already erected. If any
   object that it was not set up till the end of the second year, the
   reply is easy, that it was placed anew in its proper position, so that
   being everywhere surrounded by the children of Israel, it might have
   all its guards, according to the twelve tribes encamped in their due
   order; and again, that the tables were then actually deposited in the
   Ark of the Covenant, and by them God represented Himself, so that
   without them the tabernacle was in a manner empty; finally, that the
   solemn dedication is there treated of, for which the due season had not
   arrived, until in testimony of God's presence the covenant was
   deposited in the Ark, by way of pledge. In order the better to remove
   all ambiguity, we must briefly calculate the time. In the third month
   from their exodus the people reached Mount Sinai. On what day the Law
   was given is nowhere stated, unless we may probably conjecture that it
   was promulgated about the end of that month. Thus there will be eight
   months to be computed until the day on which the tabernacle was
   dedicated, and the tables deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, as
   Moses expressly says in the last chapter of Exodus; but, in the Book of
   Numbers, he relates that in the second month of that year the people
   removed the camp from that place, and departed to Kibroth-Hattaavah.
   [115] Now, since between the dedication of the tabernacle and their
   departure only one month intervened, we must admit that the two ascents
   into the mountain had preceded in order of time.

   Now, the question is, whether he was called to receive the first tables
   in the beginning of the fourth month? If this be allowed, he could
   scarcely have prescribed the building of the sanctuary before the end
   of the eighth month; for it would have been absurd to give [116] the
   tables of God's paternal favor between the two ascents, while the
   separation of the tabernacle was testifying of their divorce from Him.
   Thus, then, I establish the fact, that four whole months were employed
   in this long and difficult work. And surely it was wonderful that so
   short a time should suffice; had not incredible activity surpassed all
   men's expectation, whilst they all emulously devoted themselves with
   unwearied labor to hasten the work. And it is probable, that after God
   had established His covenant, He immediately delivered the ordinances
   respecting the tabernacle and its adjuncts; lest the people should be
   without the external exercises of religion, which we have seen to be so
   very necessary. But after the completion of the work, Moses was again
   commanded to come nigh to God with Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy
   elders; and after the offering of sacrifices, he was taken up into the
   cloud to hold familiar communion with God, where he passed about a
   month and a half. Having returned, and being made aware of the
   rebellion of the people, the slaughter of the three thousand took
   place, and he commanded the people to mourn. How long he remained we
   know not, but it is probable that at least a month passed before he was
   recalled We have now more than nine months; and if we add the month and
   a half during which he was kept in the mount, we shall not be far from
   the end of the year. God then reconciled Himself to the people, and
   thus the legitimate dedication of the tabernacle soon followed, which
   took place in the second year at the beginning of the first month. The
   Passover having been celebrated, the sign of removal was given in the
   second month.

   If any disagree with me, I would now have them answer me, how it is
   consistent that Moses, having detected the people's transgression,
   should then have begun to exhort them to the building of the sanctuary,
   whereas in his whole address there is no mention made of idolatry?
   Surely, all things well considered, we must be ready to confess that
   the people were still loyal when they so heartily consecrated their
   property to God. But the whole question is sufficiently settled by what
   I have alleged on the testimony of Moses, viz., that before he came
   down with the first tables the tabernacle was already in being, unless,
   perhaps, it be objected that it was another tabernacle, and different
   from that which was afterwards set up by God's command. But this is a
   very foolish cavil, for Moses had no authority to make an earthly
   dwelling-place for God, and to impose on it the sacred name whereby the
   sanctuary is always honored; and he expressly relates that God's glory
   appeared in it, in order that the people might more surely know that
   they were separated from God for their uncleanness, of which matter we
   shall again speak in its proper place. Again, the word lqch, lakach,
   [117] implies that Moses took the tabernacle out of the camp, to
   transfer it to another place. If any one should now object that the
   tabernacle was arranged according to the pattern which Moses saw in the
   mount, the reply is easy, that Moses was not then first in the mountain
   instructed in the true worship of God and heavenly mysteries, when he
   was kept there forty days, but already before the promulgation of the
   Law; nor is there any doubt but that the same things were then shewn to
   him which he had learned before, in order that the people might be more
   disposed to diligent meditation on the Law. For, from the length of
   time, they might acknowledge that nothing was omitted which it would be
   useful for them to know; since, although God might have so instructed
   His servant in a moment that nothing should have been wanting, still He
   chose gradually, and as if at His ease, to form for Himself a perfect
   teacher; and this concession was made to the infirmity of the people.
   For thus we read in Exodus 19:9,

   "Behold I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear
   when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever."

   And again, Exodus 20:21,

   "And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
   darkness, where God was."

   From whence it is plain that there is no absurdity in saying that he
   had already seen the pattern of the tabernacle wherein God would be
   worshipped.

   But lest any should object that I rest upon conjectures only, Moses
   himself plainly shews that, before he received the tables, God gave him
   instructions respecting the making of the tabernacle; for twice in
   chapter 25 it is said, "Thou shalt put in the Ark the testimony which I
   shall give thee," verses 16 and 21; from whence it is clear that the
   tables were not yet given, when from God's command he described the
   whole structure; and thence we again infer that, when the tabernacle
   was set up, he went up into the mount to bring down the tables which
   were to be placed in the Ark. But, before he begins to treat of the
   construction of the tabernacle, he imposes a tribute upon the people,
   that each, according to his means, should contribute materials both for
   the tabernacle itself and for all its furniture. The heaving, or,
   trvmh, therumah, [118] is here put simply for an offering; and is not,
   as in other passages, distinguished from another kind of sacrifice,
   which is called tnvphh, thenuphah. But the Israelites are simply
   commanded to bestow from their abundance what may suffice for the
   worship of God. It is indeed certain that all we have is God's, and
   that all He bountifully gives us is polluted unless we devote it to His
   glory. Still in His indulgence He permits us the free use of all, if
   only we testify that it remains under His power, and are ready to
   expend it as He shall command. Thus we duly offer alms, as sacrifices
   of, sweet-smelling savor; although the rich may not exhaust himself to
   poverty, but, whilst he relieves the poor, enjoys the goods which he
   possesses. In sum, whatever we offer to God is like the first-fruits,
   whereby we testify that all we have is consecrated to His glory. Now,
   although He required no assistance from the people for the building and
   adorning of His tabernacle, since it was He who, for the maintenance of
   them all, daily rained down manna from heaven; yet he would have every
   one, from the very least to the greatest, bring together, in testimony
   of their piety, whatever was necessary for the sacred work. But what He
   then would have spent on the visible sanctuary, He now requires for the
   building of His spiritual temple. Properly speaking, it is He alone
   that builds His Church; yet He uses the work of men, and will have many
   builders associated with Him, that the edifice of His Church may arise
   in some measure by the labor of men; as also He ascribes the praise of
   its prosperity and success to them. Meanwhile we offer nothing which He
   Himself has not bestowed; just as the Israelites gave nothing but what
   had been derived from his bounty alone. Therefore, He distributes the
   gifts of His Spirit in certain measures, (1 Corinthians 12:7;) that, as
   each has received more or less, he may employ it on the building of the
   Church. But this should be the best incentive to activity, that none is
   so poor or humble but that his offering is acceptable and pleasing,
   however small it may be, and almost worthless in the eyes of men.
   Moreover, it must be observed, that the tribute is not demanded
   authoritatively, but it is declared that each should freely offer what
   he pleased; for, from the beginning, Paul's word was true, that "God
   loveth a cheerful giver," (2 Corinthians 4:7;) and all Scripture
   teaches us that no obedience is pleasing to God except what is
   voluntary; for, although the word ydvnv, yidbenu, [119] is variously
   rendered by the translators, the sum comes to this, that the gift of
   each would be pleasing to God according to the cheerful alacrity of his
   mind. The old interpreter (i.e., the Vulgate) has it "qui offert
   ultroneus," (he who offers voluntarily;) but this is rather
   paraphrastic than literal. [120] Others differ from each other: some
   understand the relative as referring to the offering, and translate it,
   "whose heart shall have voluntarily given it;" others, "He who shall
   have shewn his heart liberal, or willing." The second rendering is the
   right one.

   3 And this is the offering. Hence, what I have before said is more
   fully continued, viz., that what the poor offer of their little will
   not be eclipsed by the abundance of the rich, since God deigns to
   reckon goats' hair among the sacred offerings not less than gold,
   purple, and precious stones. Again, by the varied and manifold
   contributions, He would shew, as in a glass, that a variety of gifts
   are necessary to the building of the spiritual temple, as Paul sets
   forth in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. The liberality of the rich was
   indeed more splendid; but, as they did not scruple to mix their gold
   and silver, blue, purple, and precious stones, with brass, iron, and
   other common materials, so also, now-a-days, those who aid the
   edification of the Church by their more excellent gifts, admit, without
   contempt or dislike, into fellowship poor brethren, to whom it is not
   given to equal them.

   8 And let them make me a sanctuary. By first setting before them an
   inestimable recompense, God stirs up the people to give largely; for,
   although liberality is praised by all as a most excellent virtue, yet
   no one willingly deprives himself of his own to bestow it upon others,
   since all think that it is so much lost to themselves, unless they have
   some compensation in view. Wherefore, that they may expend cheerfully,
   God promises that He will dwell among them, than which nothing is more
   desirable. But we must beware of imagining anything inconsistent with
   the nature of God, for He who sits above the heavens, and whose
   footstool is the earth, could not be enclosed in the tabernacle; but,
   because in His indulgence for the infirmities of an ignorant people, He
   desired to testify the presence of His grace and help by a visible
   symbol, the earthly sanctuary is called His dwelling amongst men,
   inasmuch as there He was not worshipped in vain. And we must bear in
   memory what we have lately seen, that it was not the infinite essence
   of God, but His name, or the record of His name, that dwelt there. This
   was the object of the expressions; that the Israelites ought not to be
   slow or lazy in setting up the tabernacle, because by these means they
   would obtain for themselves an inestimable advantage. Another clause
   follows, that the artificers should copy the pattern shewn to Moses,
   and not dare to invent anything, since it would be a profanation to mix
   up anything human with the commands of God; on which matter we shall
   treat more diffusely when we speak generally of the types. Now is
   described the form of the Ark and its covering: for the composition of
   the tabernacle, and its various parts, which Moses now only slightly
   adverts to, will be presently repeated at greater length in chapter 32.
   But, although the tabernacle was called God's house, yet there was a
   more express image of His glory in the Ark of the Covenant; because the
   Law, whereby God bound the people to Himself, was there deposited. The
   material was shittim-wood, covered or overlaid with plates of gold. As
   to the species of the tree, [121] not even the Hebrews are agreed among
   themselves, although we may conjecture that it was beautiful and
   costly; yet God would have gold over its whole surface, and even
   shining on its staves, that the dignity of the Law might be enhanced
   But here a question may arise, which introduces many others with it,
   how the sumptuous splendor both of the Ark, as well as the tabernacle
   and all its utensils, contributed to the worship of God? for it is
   certain that God would never be worshipped except agreeably to His
   nature; whence it follows, that His true worship was always spiritual,
   and therefore by no means comprised in external pomp.

   But the great number and intricacy of the ceremonies were so far from
   awakening piety, that they were even the occasion of superstition, or
   era foolish and perverse confidence. Again, so many and such various
   rites seem to have had no other tendency than to feed curiosity. It
   will be therefore worth while briefly to premise something respecting
   this point. They are, in my judgment, at fault, who think that the eyes
   of the people were captivated by these magnificent sights, lest their
   religion, being stripped of all ornament, should become dishonored,
   when amongst the Gentiles their false worship was splendid even to a
   miracle; and thus a depraved rivalry might affect their minds, [122] if
   the beauty of the tabernacle did not at least equal the pomp of others,
   as though the God they worshipped were inferior to idols. On the same
   grounds they imagine that the Jews were burdened with many observances;
   lest, if God had only sparingly and slightly exercised them, they would
   in their natural curiosity, have sought in all directions after profane
   trifles. They tell part of the truth, but not the whole; for I admit
   that this was given to the ancient people, in order that, when they saw
   the tabernacle so brilliantly ornamented, they might be inspired with
   greater reverence. I also admit that, by God's command, they were
   engrossed with many ceremonies, that they might not seek after strange
   ones; but if this had been the only object proposed in them, the whole
   legal service would have only availed for ostentation in its shadows
   and histrionic pomps. But it is most absurd to think that God so
   trifled with His people. We see, too, how honorably David and the
   Prophets speak of these exercises. [123] It is, therefore, impiety to
   suppose that the legal rites were like farces composed in imitation of
   the Gentiles. In order, then, to preserve their honor and dignity, we
   must remember the principle to which we have lately alluded, viz., that
   all of them were arranged according to the spiritual pattern which had
   been shewn to Moses in the mount. (Exodus 25:40.) And this both
   Stephen, and the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews, wisely
   observed, when they would reprove the gross follies of the people who
   continued to be wrapped up in the external ceremonies, as if religion
   were comprised in them. (Acts 7:44; Hebrews 8:5.) Stephen and the
   Apostle, therefore, are our best expositors, that the tabernacle, the
   altar, the table, the Ark of the Covenant, were of no importance except
   in so far as they referred to the heavenly pattern, of which they were
   the shadows and images. Thence their entire utility, and even their
   legitimate use, depended on the truth, (which they represented.) [124]
   For the slaughter of an ox profits nothing in itself, nay, it is but an
   unimportant thing; and so all the sacrifices, except that they were
   types, would have been thought nothing of. Whence we gather that there
   is the greatest difference between the ceremonies of the Law and the
   profane rites of the Gentiles, for they differ from each other not only
   inasmuch as God is the author of the one, and that the temerity of men
   has foolishly invented the other, but because among the Gentiles their
   religion was entirely comprised in these bare and empty pomps; whilst
   God, by these rudiments, which He gave to His people, elevated pious
   minds, as it were by steps, to higher things. Thus the Gentiles seemed
   to themselves duly to propitiate (their gods) when they offered
   victims; whilst the sacrifices of the Jews were acceptable to God,
   because they were exercises of repentance and faith. So the Law
   instructed the Jews in the spiritual worship of God, and in nothing
   else, though it were clothed in ceremonies agreeably to the
   requirements of the age. For, before the truth was fully made known,
   the childhood of the Church was to be directed by earthly elements, and
   thus, though there was great affinity and likeness between the Jews and
   Gentiles as regarded the external form of their religious service, yet
   its end was widely different. Moreover, when we would seek the body or
   substance of the ancient shadows, and the truth of the figures, we may
   learn them, not only from the Apostles, but also from the Prophets, who
   everywhere draw the attention of believers to the kingdom of Christ;
   yet their clearer explanation must be sought in the Gospel, where
   Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, shining forth, shews that their
   fulfillment exists in Himself alone. But, although by His coming He
   abolished these typical ceremonies as regards their use, yet at the
   same time He established the reverence justly due to them; since they
   have no claim to be held in esteem on any other grounds, except that
   their completion is found in Him; for, if they are separated from Him,
   it is plain that they are mere farces, [125] since neither the blood of
   animals, nor the sweetness of fat, nor aromatic odors, nor candles, nor
   anything of that sort, have any power to propitiate God. This indeed
   must be remembered, that the Jews did not pay attention to the legal
   sacrifices in vain, since the promises were annexed to them; as often,
   therefore, as these sentences occur, "your iniquity shall be blotted
   out," -- "ye shall appear before my face," -- "I will hear you from the
   sanctuary," we are reminded that all the ancient figures were sure
   testimonies of God's grace and of eternal salvation; and thus Christ
   was represented in them, since all the promises are in Him, yea, and
   amen. (2 Corinthians 1:20.) Yet it by no means follows from hence that
   there were mysteries hidden in all their details, since some, with
   mistaken acuteness, pass over no point, however trifling, without an
   allegorical exposition; as, in this passage, for instance, the
   dimensions of the ark afford them matter of speculation. [126] But it
   will be enough for the sound and sober-minded to know that God would
   have His Law deposited in a handsome vessel, in order that its majesty
   should be recognized. He commanded that the ark itself should be
   carried with staves, that the hands of the Levites might not touch it,
   and thus that its sanctity might be the greater

   16. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony. The title of "the
   testimony," which is often given to the law, indicates that something
   more is contained in it than the rule of a just and holy life; viz.,
   the compact whereby God bound Himself to His people, and His people to
   Himself; therefore the words "the table of the covenant," are
   afterwards used instead of "the testimony." Thus the word dt, [127]
   gneduth, in this passage, and similar ones, is equivalent to a
   contract, which is commonly called a convention In this sense the
   Prophet in Psalm 114 calls by the name of testimonies, not only the
   Commandments, but whatever God hath delivered by the hand of Moses for
   the salvation of His people. In Psalm 14:7, the word testimony is added
   as if in explanation of the word law: "The law of the Lord is perfect;
   the testimony of the Lord is sure;" as in Isaiah 8:20, where it is
   said, "To the law and to the testimony," it is not that two different
   things are referred to, but the utility of the law is commended,
   because it contains all that God would have testified to His people.

   17 And thou shalt make a mercy-seat. The primary root of the verb kphr,
   caphar, from whence this noun is derived, [128] is used for "to smear
   with pitch," but in the Hiphil conjugation, it signifies either to
   expiate, or to purge, or to receive into favor; whence kphr, copher, is
   expiation, as we have seen elsewhere; and kphrt, caphoreth, a covering
   or lid. Yet I doubt not but that Moses alludes in this word to a
   metaphorical meaning, for the law requires a covering to conceal our
   transgressions. And it is probable that, when Paul calls Christ
   hilasterion, (Romans 3:25,) and John hilasmon, (1 John 2:2,) they both
   refer to this figure, because God was propitiated towards believers by
   the covering of the Law, so as to shew Himself favorable to them by
   hearing their vows and prayers. For as long as the law stands forth
   before God's face it subjects us to His wrath and curse; and hence it
   is necessary that the blotting out of our guilt should be interposed,
   so that God may be reconciled with us. Nor is it without reason that
   David exclaims, after he has proclaimed the righteousness of the law,
   "Who can understand his errors?" (Psalm 19:12.) Whence we gather that,
   without a propitiation, the law does not bring us near to God, but
   accuses us before Him. And assuredly, when I consider all things, it
   seems to me a tame explanation, that Moses spoke literally of the
   cover, when he [129] would have the Cherubim turn their faces toward
   it, and God promises that He will give His answers from it. By these
   honorable distinctions it is exalted above the Ark.

   18 And thou shalt make two cherubims. I have stated in my commentary on
   Genesis and elsewhere, [130] that there are various opinions respecting
   the word cherub; but that those approach most nearly to the truth who
   make the k, caph, not a servile, but a radical letter, and take it
   generally for any image; for those who suppose the kto be a note of
   similitude, render it "like a boy;" which in itself is forced, and
   besides it is refuted by the words of Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 1:10, and
   Ezekiel 10:1,) who calls the forms of a calf, a lion, and an eagle by
   this name, as well as the human form. It is enough for me that the
   images were winged, which represented angels. Therefore, when Moses
   speaks of the angels, who were placed as guards to keep man away from
   approaching paradise, he calls them cherubim; not so much in reference
   to that time, as to keep the people in the doctrine of the Law [131]
   But God appointed angels, by whom He exercises His dominion, and who
   are the ministers of His blessings, to be a symbol of His presence; for
   as often as He manifested Himself to believers by angels, He in a
   manner extended His hand to them. On this ground, David, and other
   Prophets, in order to encourage themselves to confidence in prayer,
   often speak of God as "dwelling between the cherubims," (Psalm 80:1;
   64:1; Isaiah 37:16;) as much as to say, that He conversed familiarly
   with His people, since His virtue exercises itself by His angels. That
   they covered the lid of the ark with their extended wings, I do not
   imagine to have been done to hide it, but to mark the readiness of
   their obedience, for the extension of their wings is equivalent to
   their being prepared for the performance of whatever God might command.
   Thus they are said to turn their faces towards the mercy-seat, because
   they are attentive to the will of God. Moreover, because the fullness
   of the Godhead resides in Christ, He justly declares that, in His
   descent upon earth, the heavens were opened that the angels might
   ascend and descend. Their looking towards each other indicates that
   harmony in which the angels are united for performing the commands of
   God. It is indeed a plausible conceit, [132] that the two cherubim were
   the Old and New Testaments, which look from one to the other, and
   surround the mercy-seat, inasmuch as Christ is their common object; but
   this notion vanishes before the contradiction of many passages of
   Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] "Calvine here hath a singular opinion by himself concerning the
   time of erecting the tabernacle, with the parts and members thereof,
   which begin here to be described; for he thinketh that the tabernacle
   was built and set up before Moses had brought the first tables; and his
   reasons are these: -- 1. There is mention made of the tabernacle, 33-7,
   immediately after Moses was come down with the tables in his hand,
   which he broke; and therefore the tabernacle being presently after
   spoken of, must be made before. Answer. This was not the great
   tabernacle which was afterwards made for God's service, for that
   tabernacle was not set without the Host, as this was, but in the midst:
   Lippoman. But it was Moses's tabernacle, whither the people had access
   to consult with God. Jun. 2. In this chapter it is said, verse 16, Thou
   shalt put in the ark the testimony, which I shall give thee;' therefore
   he received the testament before he made the ark, wherein he was to put
   it. Answer. This followeth not, that the ark was therefore made first,
   but that the form thereof was described first how it should be made,
   which was in the Mount; after which form it was made after that Moses
   had received the tables of the testimony. 3. When Moses cometh to
   exhort the people to build the tabernacle, he maketh no mention at all
   of their apostasy and idolatry; therefore it is evident, that they were
   yet sound, they had not yet committed that sin, seeing they do so
   cheerfully consecrate their best things to the Lord. "Answer. -- l. The
   people had already received correction for their fault; and Moses, in
   sign of God's indignation against them, had removed his tent from among
   them, 33-7; therefore it cannot be said that no mention is made of
   their falling away. 2. The people, such especially as were touched with
   remorse for their sin, did so much the more shew themselves cheerful in
   God's service, as a sign of true repentance. 3. And Moses having
   entreated the Lord for His people, would not be still harping upon the
   same string, in upbraiding them with their fault, lest he might
   altogether have discouraged them. "Wherefore, it is very clear that the
   tabernacle was not erected and set up before the receiving of the
   tables, but after; for these reasons: -- 1. Because Moses is here
   bidden to make the tabernacle according to all which the Lord should
   show him in the Mount; but the form thereof was first showed him in the
   Mount, when he continued there forty days and nights, in the end
   whereof he received the tables, Deut. 9:10; therefore the tabernacle
   could not be made before the fashion thereof was shewed to Moses.
   Calvine here answereth that divers times before this Moses was in the
   Mount with God, when the fashion of the tabernacle might be shewed him.
   But it is evident, 24:18, that this was done in the forty days and
   nights, when Moses was entered into the cloud, and there so long
   continued. 2. It is expressly said that the tabernacle was reared up in
   the second year, and the first month, the first day, xl. 17. It was not
   then dedicated and set in order only, as Calvine answereth, but then
   first set up. And in the second year, in the second month, upon the
   twentieth day, they removed from Sinai, which was about a month and a
   half after; but if the tabernacle were built before Moses received the
   tables, he after the finishing thereof was twice with the Lord, each
   time forty days; which could not be, seeing about forty or fifty days
   after the tabernacle was erected, the whole camp removed, as is said.
   3. Besides, by this means a great part of Exodus shall be transposed;
   all that followeth from chap. 35. to the end, concerning the making and
   setting up of the tabernacle, should be in order placed before the 32,
   33, and 34, chapters; this being admitted, that the tabernacle was
   first erected, before Moses had the tables delivered to him. Therefore,
   rather the order of the story is this: first, there is the description
   of the tabernacle to chap. 30; then followeth the let and impediment to
   the building of it, the people's trans- gression, chap. 32-33; thirdly,
   the execution of God's commandment, and framing of the tabernacle,
   chap. 35:40; fourthly, the erection and setting of it up, chap. xl

   504-505, briefly, but most satisfactorily, enumerates the objects of
   the Ceremonial Law in reply to the deistical writers, who, like De
   Wette, "can find out no rational basis for it," and can form no other
   notion of these pedantic regulations, this gnat-straining, as he calls
   it, than as the production of a later priestcraft. "The best apology
   Hengstenberg says of the Ceremonial Law lies in pointing out its
   objects, and these, therefore, we present to refute the charges brought
   against it: -- First, It served to cherish the religious sentiment. The
   Israelite was reminded by it in all his relations, even the most
   insignificant and external, of God; the thought of God was introduced
   into the very midst of the popular life. Secondly, It required the
   recognition of sin, and thus called forth the first thing essential for
   the reception of redemption, a sense of the need of redemption. The
   people must be burdened and heavy-laden, in order that the Lord might
   say to them, Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy, laden, and
   I will give you rest. The Law was, and was intended to be, a heavy
   yoke, and therefore would awaken a longing after the Redeemer.
   Everywhere it proclaimed, Touch not, taste not, handle not! and thus
   was a perpetual remembrancer of sin. Thirdly, It served to separate
   Israel from the heathen; it erected between the two a wall of
   separation, by which communication was prevented. Compare Ephesians
   2:14. Not yet strong enough to conquer heathenism, the people were, so
   to speak, shut up, to be withdrawn from its influence, to preserve them
   for the time in which, armed with power from on high, they might
   commence an offensive war against it. The preliminary limitation
   effected by the Ceremonial Law served as the means of the future
   illimitedness. Fourthly, Many things in the Ceremonial Law served, by
   impressions on the senses, to awaken reverence for holy things among a
   sensual people. The bad consequence of denying this is, that it will
   then be necessary to impose a symbolic meaning on institutions, in
   which evidently nothing of the kind is to be found. Fifthly, One
   principal object of the Ceremonial Law lay in its symbolic meaning. The
   people, enthralled in visible objects, were not yet capable of vitally
   appropriating supersensual truth in words, the form most suited to
   their nature. It was needful for the truth to condescend, to come down
   to their power of apprehension, to prepare itself a body from visible
   things, in order to free the people from the bondage of the visible.
   This form was common to the Israelitish religion with that of the
   heathen, and therein lies its best apology. Would we rather not speak
   at all to the dumb than make use of signs? The Ceremonial Law was not
   the opposite to the worship of God in spirit and in truth, but only an
   imperfect form of the same, a necessary preparation for it. The
   accommodation was only formal, one which did not alter the essence, but
   only presented it in large capital letters to children who could not
   yet read a small running-hand." - Ryland's Translation, Edinburgh,
   1847.

   Aharonis sacerdotis, et vestes filiorum ejus ad fungendum sacerdotio.


   5. Take ye from among you an offering. I have introduced a passage from
   chapter 35, wherein Moses again requires what he had before prescribed;
   but he goes more into detail, and treats at greater length of the parts
   of the tabernacle. In the former passage he employed a verb, where he
   here uses a noun, "willing or voluntary of heart." There is, however,
   no ambiguity in the meaning; since in both places God requires a
   cheerful zeal, so that they may not only contribute abundantly, but
   willingly. He will afterwards use a different form of expression, viz.,
   that they did their duty, whose heart roused, or stirred them up, so as
   to distinguish them from the indifferent and slow. -- 5:21.

   10. And every wise-hearted among you. Thus he denominates the
   artificers, who excelled in shrewdness of intellect, and so, after
   having commanded them severally of their private means to supply the
   materials, he now exhorts others to contribute their industry for
   shaping and joining them together. He then briefly enumerates the parts
   of the Tabernacle, a longer explanation of which will be seen in
   chapter 26. This is, therefore, a kind of epitome of all those things,
   of which he before spoke more in full, since it was necessary to spur
   them on afresh to the performance of what they had been clearly
   instructed in. For we know that instruction is very often coldly
   received without the addition of exhortations. It might indeed seem
   strange, [133] how so much wealth could be possessed by a miserably
   pillaged people, and long driven to servile work; unless it may be
   inferred from the abundance which is here described, that they were
   incredibly enriched at their departure from Egypt by the booty which
   God gave them. The kingdom of Egypt was very wealthy; and its people,
   as we know, had always been devoted to pleasures and luxuries. What,
   then, they had accumulated by their rapacity in many years, flowed away
   from them by the secret influence of God, when they were suddenly made
   prodigal. But, just as He had blinded the Egyptians, that they should
   profusely give all they had, so He now directed the minds and hearts of
   His people, that, mindful of so great a benefit, they should willingly
   expend, at His command, what they had obtained of His mere grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] "Particular stress is laid on the contrast, which the condition
   of the Israelitish nation at that time presents to the splendor and
   speedy completion of the tent. That tent was certainly splendid, but,
   in point of fact, exceedingly simple in its construction. If we compare
   it with the monuments of Egyptian architecture, its relative simplicity
   must strike us in a much greater degree. As to the materials that were
   required for it, it admits of proof that the Israelites might well have
   been possessed of them at that time. The wilderness even might supply
   them with many of these things. With respect to other things, the
   metals, precious stones, etc, we must keep in view the condition of a
   people that had just come out of Egypt. History describes that country
   as having mercantile transactions with Asia, even from the earliest
   times. The people had acquired property, in part at least, in Egypt;
   the description in Exodus 32, leaves us no doubt as to the possessions,
   and even wealth, that they had gained there. They had not gone out of
   Egypt empty-handed, but richly provided with silver and gold, 12:36. --

   Exodus 25

   Exodus 25:23-30

   23. Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be
   the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and
   half the height thereof.

   23. Facies quoque mensam ex lignis sittim: duorum cubitorum erit
   longitudo ejus, et cubiti latitudo ejus, cubiti vero et dimidii alitudo
   ejus.

   24. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown
   of gold round about.

   24. Et teges eam auro puro, faciesque ei coronam auream in circuitu.

   25. And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
   about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round
   about.

   25. Facies quoque ei clausuram latam quatuor digitos in circuitu:
   faciesque coronam auream clausurae illi in circuitu.

   26. And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in
   the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

   26. Facies insuper ei quatuor annulos aureos, quos pones in quatuor
   angulis qui sunt in quatuor pedibus ejus.

   27. Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves
   to bear the table.

   27. E regione illius clausurae erunt annuli per quos trajicientur
   vectes ad portandum mensam:

   28. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
   with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

   28. Faciesque vectes illos e lignis sittim: et operies eos auro, et
   feretur illis mensa.

   29. And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and
   covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt
   thou make them.

   29. Facies etiam scutellas ejus, et cochlearia ejus, et opercula ejus,
   et crateres ejus quibus libabitur: ex auro mundo facies ca.

   30. And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

   30. Et pones super mensam illam panem facierum coram me jugiter.


   23. Thou shalt also make a table. The sentiment of a certain ancient
   bishop [134] is deservedly praised, who, when he sold the sacred
   vessels in the time of a famine, to relieve the distress of the poor,
   thus excused himself to the Church: "Our God, who does not eat or
   drink, has no need of patens and chalices;" and yet this seems little
   in accordance with this His command, that bread should be offered to
   Him. I answer, that if, under that pretext, the bishop had stripped the
   sacred table of its ornaments under the Law, he would have spoken
   unseasonably, what, under the Gospel, he spoke piously and wisely;
   because at the coming of Christ the shadows of the Law ceased. But God
   would then have the loaves, which were offered to Him, deposited among
   the golden dishes and censers, and spoons placed with them, not that He
   had need of meat and drink, but that He might prescribe the duty of
   temperance to His people, by deigning to have His table among them;
   for, when they ate of the same wheat, of which the sacred loaves were
   made, they were reminded by that symbol that their meat and drink was
   to be taken, as if they sat before God, and were His guests. Finally,
   they were taught that the food, by which man's life is sustained, is in
   a manner sacred to God; that thus they might be contented with simple
   and sober food, and might not profane the things which were dedicated
   to His service. Although, therefore, this offering might appear to be
   gross and rude, yet it had a just object, i.e., that believers might
   acknowledge that God presided over their tables, because the loaves
   were presented in the temple before God in the name of all the people.
   The same was the intention of the first-fruits, in which the produce of
   the whole year was consecrated; that even in their feasts they might
   cherish a recollection of God, who fed them as a father does his
   children. They are called "the bread of faces" [135] by Moses, because
   they always appeared before God, in which sense the Greeks called them
   the bread protheseos, because they were always in His presence; for it
   was not permitted them to remove the precious offering, until others
   were substituted in their place. I now pass over many points, because
   what I now omit will soon have to be treated of.

   Exodus 25

   Exodus 25:31-40

   31. And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
   shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls,
   his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

   31. Facies item candelabrum ex auro puro: ductile fiet candelabrum
   illud: restile ejus, et calamus ejus scyphi ejus, sphaerulae ejus, et
   flores ejus ex ipso erunt.

   32. And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches
   of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the
   candlestick out of the other side:

   32. Et sex calami egredientur a lateribus ejus: tres calami candelabri
   ex latere ejus uno, et tres calami candelabri ex latere ejus altero.

   33. Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one
   branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a
   knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the
   candlestick.

   33. Tres calices in speciem nucis amygdalinae deformati erunt in calamo
   uno, spaerula, et flos, et tres calices in speciem nucis amygdalinae
   deformati in calamo altero, sphaerula et flos: sic de sex calamis
   egredientibus e candelabro.

   34. And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds,
   with their knops and their flowers.

   34. Et in candelabro erunt quatuor calices in speciem nucis amygdalinae
   deformaft, sphaerulae ejus, et flores ejus.

   35. And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a
   knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of
   the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the
   candlestick.

   35. Eritque sphaerula sub duobus calamis ex ipso, sphaerula item sub
   duobus calamis ex ipso, et sphaerula sub duobus calamis ex ipso: sic de
   sex calamis egredientibus e candelabro.

   36. Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all of it
   shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

   36. Sphaerulae eorum et calami eorum ex ipso erunt: totum ipsum ductile
   unum, ex auro puro.

   37. And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light
   the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.

   37. Facies quoque lucernas ejus septem, quas collocabis in sublimi, ut
   luceant ad latus faciei ejus.

   38. And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of
   pure gold.

   38. Et forcipes ipsius, et receptacula ejus ex auro puro.

   39. Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

   39. Talento auri puri facies illud, et omnia vasa ista.

   40. And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed
   thee in the mount.

   40. Vide autem ut facias juxta similitudinem suam, quae tibi ostensa
   est in monte.


   31. And thou shalt make a candlestick. God would have seven bright
   lamps burning day and night in the Tabernacle: first, that the people
   might know that they were directed by God Himself as to how they were
   to worship Him aright, and that a light was set before their eyes which
   might disperse all the darkness of error; and, secondly, lest they
   should obscure the very worship of God with their gross inventions, but
   that, intent on the instruction of the Law, they might with a pure and
   enlightened mind seek after God in all the ceremonies. Let us,
   therefore, remark a distinction here set forth between the rule of true
   religion and the superstitions of the Gentiles; because the Gentiles
   were carried away by their foolish and blind devotions, as they call
   them, into circuitous and erring ways, so that nothing was straight in
   them; for unless we have divine teaching to enlighten us, our own
   reason will beget nothing but mere vanity. But it was not enough for
   the Israelites that the right way should be pointed out, unless their
   eyes were open to direct them, since men sometimes are blind in the
   very midst of light. And this occurred to themselves not only when they
   went astray into strange and adulterous worships, for though they held
   fast the external form of the Law, they were, nevertheless, degenerate;
   and religion was corrupted among them by foul superstitions, when, in
   obedience to their carnal reason, they conceived that religion
   consisted in ceremonies. For when God is not worshipped spiritually
   according to His nature, this is to travesty Him. Hence there was so
   much security in the hypocrites, that they proudly despised all the
   reproofs of the Prophets, nay, that they broke out into open fury
   whenever their empty pomps were condemned. But the candlestick, shining
   with its seven lights, reminded the people that, in their worship of
   God, they should look attentively to the light of heavenly doctrine.

   But, for the understanding of this type, the vision of Zechariah will
   be no slight assistance to us, since the truth of this symbol is there
   set forth. (Zechariah 4:2.) God there promises that the power of His
   Spirit will alone avail, and more than avail, for the preservation of
   His Church, although it may be destitute of all other aid. To awaken
   confidence in this, He represents the same image of a candlestick which
   is here described, with the addition of some other circumstances,
   whereby He reminds us that the shining lights were no vain show like
   stage plays, but that in the candlestick was represented what believers
   would really experience to take place. But, that the comparison may be
   made clearer, we must say a little respecting this passage. The
   material of the candlestick is pure gold, whereby the excellency of the
   thing signified is denoted. But, when we have spoken somewhat of its
   form, the application of Zechariah's prophecy will be more manifest.
   Some parts of it were merely for ornament, that its dignity might be
   increased by its very appearance, such as the flowers and the balls or
   knops; others for use, as the bowls or receptacles, to prevent the
   sacred oil from falling on the ground. The lamps were placed at the
   top, that the Israelites might know that men are surrounded with
   darkness on earth, if God did not enlighten His Church from on high,
   and that by day and by night. Thus Isaiah, describing the kingdom of
   Christ, in which the reality of this sign was at length exhibited,
   says, -- "Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
   the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
   seen upon thee." And again,

   "Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
   for the Lord shall be thy everlasting light."
   (Isaiah 60:2-20.)

   Now, since God is called the Father of lights, the grace of
   illumination resides in the Spirit; and since a variety of gifts are
   distributed by the Spirit, there were seven lamps which visibly
   represented what Paul says, --

   "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
   withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
   another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by
   the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to
   another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
   discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another
   the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the
   self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will." (1
   Corinthians 12:7-11.)

   Some, however, have gratuitously invented a mystery in the number
   seven, whence the common notion [136] among the Papists about the
   sevenfold grace of the Spirit, which is refuted both by the above-cited
   passage of St. Paul and the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, where a greater
   number of gifts are enumerated. I suppose rather that perfection is
   denoted by the seven lamps according to the ordinary and acknowledged
   use (of the figure); as if God thus declared that nothing would be
   wanting for the full enlightenment of believers, who should seek it
   from its one and only source; secondly, that the Spirit presides over
   all religious rites when He shines forth to the Church in His gifts.
   Now, the Prophet, (Zechariah 4:2,) desiring to teach that what had been
   shewn forth in this visible symbol would be fulfilled in the
   restoration of the Church, adds to the lamps seven pipes and two
   olive-trees, from whence oil would continually flow, so that there was
   no fear of want or failure. Thus he signifies that God is possessed of
   a manifold abundance of blessings for the enrichment of the Church; and
   so that the virtue which flows down from heaven is sufficient for its
   preservation, according to what is added in connection,

   "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,
   saith the Lord of hosts." (Zechariah 4:6.)

   For although God uses the ministry of men and earthly means at His
   discretion for the protection and maintenance of the Church, yet He
   would have, as is just, all the praise ascribed to Himself; whilst He
   would also have believers to be contented under His guardianship, and
   not to be discouraged although they should find no ground of confidence
   in the world.

   40 And look that thou make them. He again inculcates, what we have
   already seen, that Moses should take care that all things were exactly
   modeled according to the original or pattern seen in the mount. But it
   is certain that it is not any mere vision which is here in question,
   but that the external ornaments of the sanctuary have reference to
   their spiritual object, as is plain from the explanation of Stephen and
   the Apostle. Wherefore we need not wonder that Zechariah should say
   that God would make manifest, and that by certain proof, under the
   reign of Christ, that it was no empty spectacle which God had set
   before His people under the Law.

   6. E lapidibus integris aedificabis altare Jehovae Dei tui: et offeres
   super illud holocausta Jehovae Deo tuo:

   7. And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
   rejoice before the LORD thy God.

   7. Et offeres sacrificia prosperiratum, comedesque illic, ac laetaberis
   coram Jehova Deo tuo.


   Leviticus 24

   Leviticus 24:1-4

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil
   olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

   2. Praecipe filiis Israel ut afferant tibi oleum olivae purum, contusum
   pro luminari, ad accendendas lucernas semper.

   3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning
   before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your
   generations.

   3. Extra velum testimonii in tabernaculo conventionis disponet eas
   Aharon a vespera usque ad mane, coram Jehova semper: statutum
   per-perpetuum erit in generationibus vestris.

   4. He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD
   continually.

   4. Super candelabrum mundum disponet lucernas coram Jehova semper.


   Exodus 27:20 And thou shalt command the children of Israel. I have
   transferred these two passages from elsewhere, since they relate to the
   service of the tabernacle; for the children of Israel are commanded to
   contribute as much oil as may be sufficient for the seven lamps. Now,
   since Divine illumination and the grace of the Holy Spirit were, as we
   have seen, the truth of this symbol, God requires pure oil, i.e., not
   muddy, or mixed with lees, for, had it been in any respect faulty, so
   much would have been detracted from the dignity of the mystery. Its
   purity, then, shewed that nothing mean or common was signified by it;
   that the Israelites also might bring with them pure minds, and duly
   prepared and disposed to consider the spiritual light. He again
   repeats, that the oil must be supplied seasonably at its proper hours,
   so that the lamps may be always burning; that thus the children of
   Israel might learn that nothing is more opposed to the worship of God
   than obscurity and darkness; and that it is not to be interrupted at
   intervals, [137] but that the direction of the Spirit should shine from
   heaven in a perpetual flow. Thus, in the second passage cited, He
   thrice reiterates the word "continually," to shew that the true light
   should never be put out in any respect. This office God enjoins upon
   the priests, because they ought to be ministers of light when they are
   interpreting the Law, which David calls "the lamp of our feet, and the
   light of our paths." (Psalm 119:105.) But what is the meaning of the
   offering (of the oil) by the people, since men are possessed of no
   power for the spiritual enlightening of their own minds? I reply that,
   in the types of the Law, the several parts are not to be so
   scrupulously forced to the rule, as if there were nothing in the
   outward sign with which the reality did not correspond; and again, that
   although men having nothing of their own and of themselves to bring,
   yet, that they may more diligently exert themselves in their endeavors
   to serve God, they are justly required to dedicate themselves and all
   that they have to God. At the end, where the words "a statute for ever"
   are added, understand them to mean, until the real manifestation of
   those things, of which the candlestick and its lamps were a type. This
   point I have discussed in Genesis [138] It is called "a statute from
   the [139] children of Israel," (a filiis Israel,) since God requires
   its observance from them; unless it be preferred to translate it with
   Jerome, "Before (coram) the children of Israel." The exposition of
   others, "among (apud) the children of Israel," or from the fathers to
   the children, is harsher, and altogether forced.

   Numbers 8

   Numbers 8:1-4

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps,
   the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.

   2. Loquere ad Aharon, et dicas illi, Quando accendes lucernam, contra
   faciem candelabri lucebunt septem lucernae.

   3. And Aaron did so: he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
   candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

   3. Fecitque ita Aharon: contra faciem candelabri accendit lucernas
   ejus, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova ipsi Mosi.

   4. And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft
   thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the
   pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.

   4. Et hoc est opus candelabri, ductile aureum usque ad hastile suum,
   usque ad flores suos ductile erat, juxta exemplar quod ostenderat
   Jehova ipsi Mosi, sic fecit candelabrum.


   2 When thou lightest the lamps. This precept, like many others, is not
   inserted in its proper place. Moses again declares what was the use of
   the candlestick, and how the lamps should be arranged, so that their
   light might be spread through the sanctuary, and that the brightness of
   the gold might shine over against them; for this was the reason why God
   would have the lamps lighted against the face of, or opposite to, the
   candlestick, that the very stand of the light might retain its beauty.
   Moreover, it is expressly stated that Aaron obeyed God's command, as if
   in no despicable matter, as he had received it from Moses. To this also
   refers what immediately follows, that it was made "according unto the
   pattern" which Moses had seen in the mount; and this was, as I have
   before explained it, that God is the Father of lights, who illuminates
   His Church by His Spirit, that it may not wander in darkness; and so,
   whilst darkness covers the whole earth, He is as an everlasting light
   to believers instead of the sun and moon, as says Isaiah 60:19

   Exodus 26

   Exodus 26:1-37

   1. Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine
   twined linen, and blue, and purpl e, and scarlet: with cherubims of

   laqueolos facies in extremo cortintae quae est in conjunctione secunda:
   oppositi erunt laqueoli alter alteri.

   6. And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains
   together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.

   8. The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of
   one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one
   measure.

   8. Longitudo cortinae unius, triginta cubitorum: et latitudo cortinae
   unius, quatuor cubitorum: mensura una erit undecim cortinis:

   9. And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
   by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of
   the tabernacle.

   9. Et conjunges quinque cortinas seorsum: et sex cortinas seorsum: et
   conduplicabis cortinam sextam e regione faciei tentorii.

   10. And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that
   is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain
   which coupleth the second.

   10. Facies autem quinquaginta laqueolos in ora cortinae unius in
   extremo in conjunctione, et quinquaginta laqueolos in ora cortinae
   con-junctionis secundae.

   11. And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into
   the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

   11. Facies item uncinos aereos quinquaginta, quos induces in laqueolos,
   et conjunges tentorium, et erit unum.

   12. And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the
   half-curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the
   tabernacle.

   12. Superfluitas autem quae redundat in cortinis tentorii, nempe
   dimidium cortinae redundantis, su-perfluet a tergo tabernaculi.

   13. And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side, of that
   which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall
   hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to
   cover it.

   13. Cubitusque hinc, et cubitus illinc, qui redundat in longitudine
   cortinarum tentorii, redundabit super latera tabernaculi hinc et inde,
   ut tegat illud.

   14. And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed
   red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

   14. Facies item operimentum tentorio e pellibus arietum rubifactis:
   operimentum item e pellibus taxorum superne.

   15. And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
   standing up.

   15. Facies et tabulas tabernaculo e lignis sittim stantes.

   16. Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half
   shall be the breadth of one board.

   16. Decem cubitorum longitudo tabulae: cubiti vero et dimidii latitudo
   tabulae unius.

   17. Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against

   17. Duo cardines erunt tabulae uni, instar graduum sealae dispositi,
   alter e regione alterius, sic facies omnibus tabulis tabernaculi.

   18. And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on
   the south side southward.

   18. Facies autem tabulas tabernaculo, viginti tabulas ad latus
   meridianum ad austrum.

   19. And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
   boards: two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets
   under another board for his two tenons.

   19. Et quadraginta bases argenteas facies sub viginti tabulis, duas
   bases sub una tabula, pro duobus cardinibus ejus: et duas bases sub
   tabula altera, pro duobus cardinibus ejus.

   20. And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, there
   shall be twenty boards:

   20. In latere vero tabernaculi secundo ad plagam Aquilonis, viginti
   tabulas.

   21. And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and
   two sockets under another board

   21. Et quadraginta bases earum argenteas, duas bases sub una tabula, et
   duas bases sub tabula altera.

   22. And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six
   boards.

   22. Porro in latere tabernaculi ad occidentem facies sex tabulas.

   23. And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in
   the two sides.

   23. Et duas tabulas facies angulis tabernaculi in latere occidentali:

   24. And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
   coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be
   for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

   24. Quae erunt quasi gemellae inferne, et simul erunt quasi gemellae in
   fastigio ejus in circulum unum: sic erit de duabus illis: in duobus
   angulis erunt.

   25. And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
   sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under
   another board.

   25. Erunt igitur octo tabulae, et bases earum argenteae, sexdecim
   bases: duae bases erunt sub tabula una, et duae bases sub tabula
   altera.

   26. And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of
   the one side of the tabernacle,

   26. Facies etiam vectes e lignis sittim, quinque tabulis pro latere
   tabernaculi uno.

   27. And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
   and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two
   sides westward.

   27. Et quinque vectes tabulis pro latere tabernaculi altero: et quinque
   vectes tabulis pro latere tabernaeuli, pro latere inquam vergente ad
   occi- dentem.

   28. And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end
   to end.

   28. Vectis autem medius per medium tabularum transibit ab extremo ad
   extremum.

   29. And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings
   of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with
   gold.

   29. Tabulas vero teges auro, atque annulos earum facies ex auro, per
   quos trajicientur vectes, coope-riesque vectes ipso auro.

   30. And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
   thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

   30. Et ita eriges tabernaculum secundum dispositionem ejus, quae tibi
   ostensa est in monte.

   31. And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
   fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:

   31. Facies et velum ex hyacintho, et purpura, et vermiculo cocci, et
   bysso retorta, opere phrygionico facies illud cum figuris cherubin.

   32. And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid
   with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of
   silver.

   32. Et pones illud super quatuor columnas sittim obductas auro (un-cini
   earum aurei) super quatuor bases argenteas.

   33. And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest
   bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail
   shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.

   33. Ponesque velum sub uncinis, et introduces illuc intra velum arcam
   testimonii, dividetque velum illud vobis inter sanctum et sanctum
   sanctorum.

   34. And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in
   the most holy place.

   34. Pones insuper propitiatorium super arcata testimonii in sancto
   sanctorum.

   35. And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick
   over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south:
   and thou shalt put the table on the north side.

   35. Pones quoque mensam illam extra velum, et candelabrum e regione
   mensae in latere tabernaculi ad meridiem, et mensam pones in latere
   aquilonis.

   36. And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue,
   and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with
   needlework.

   36. Et facies velum ad ostium tabernaculi ex hyacintho, et purpura, et
   vermiculo cocci, et bysso retorta opere acupictoris.

   37. And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood,
   and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou
   shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

   37. Velo autem facies quinque columnas ex sittim, quas teges auro, et
   uncini earum aurei, fundesque els quinque bases aereas.


   1. Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle. In the whole construction
   of the tabernacle we must remember what we have already seen, that the
   Israelites were instructed by external figures how precious a thing is
   the worship of God, and therefore that they must diligently beware lest
   it should be polluted by any meanness. For all this richness and
   magnificence of ornament was the very contrast to meanness. They were
   also reminded that, if they would be accounted pure worshippers of God,
   they must avoid all uncleanness, for the tabernacle was the type of the
   Church. Thus it is certain that by its external ornaments the
   excellency of spiritual gifts was designated. On this ground Isaiah,
   discoursing of the perfect glory of the Church as it would be under the
   reign of Christ, says,

   "I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with
   sapphires; and I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
   carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones,"
   (Isaiah 54:11, 12;)

   by which words he plainly signifies that the Church would be adorned
   with heavenly beauty, since all kinds of graces shone forth in her But
   the chief excellency of her adornment must be referred to the
   instruction which renews us into the image of God. Thus David, when he
   celebrates the beauty of God's house, assigns this honor chiefly to the
   exercises of faith and piety:

   "One thing have I desired of the Lord," he says, "that will I seek
   after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
   life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."
   (Psalm 27:4.)

   Was this that he might feed his eyes with empty pictures, with its
   costly materials, and with the exquisite workmanship of it? Assuredly
   he does not speak of gazing inquisitively at it, but thus alludes to
   its visible workmanship, that with the spiritual eyes of faith he may
   consider the glory more excellent than the whole world, which was there
   represented. Nor indeed did anything magnificent appear in the
   tabernacle to delight men's eyes, but rather was all its richness and
   excellence covered up with goats' hair and paltry leather, in order
   that believers beneath that hidden beauty might reflect on something
   higher than the carnal sense.

   It will suffice to have given these general hints; I now descend to
   particulars, in which let not my readers expect of me any conceits
   which may gratify their ears, since nothing is better than to contain
   ourselves within the limits of edification; and it would be puerile to
   make a collection of the minutiae wherewith some philosophize; since it
   was by no means the intention of God to include mysteries in every hook
   and loop; and even although no part were without a mystical meaning,
   which no one in his senses will admit, it is better to confess our
   ignorance than to indulge ourselves in frivolous conjectures. Of this
   sobriety, too, the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews is a fit master
   for us, who, although he professedly shews the analogy between the
   shadows of the Law and the truth manifested in Christ, yet sparingly
   touches upon some main points, and by this moderation restrains us from
   too curious disquisitions and deep speculations. In the first place,
   curtains are made of twilled linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet,
   which, when coupled together, made an inclosure of forty cubits; for
   they were ten in number, and the breadth of each was four cubits. By
   "cunning work," commentators are agreed that embroidery is meant,
   especially when God commands that cherubim should be made in them. But
   some translate the word cherubim by the general name of pictures, [140]
   which, although it is not grammatically incorrect, yet, since we have
   before seen that angels were designated by this word, it; is more
   probable that figures of angels were everywhere scattered over them;
   for, when the majesty of God is represented to the life by Daniel 7:10,
   "ten thousand times ten thousand" are said to stand around His
   judgment-seat, Ridiculous is it of the Papists [141] to infer from
   hence that churches would be empty and unsightly unless they are
   adorned with images; for in order that the similitude should hold good,
   they must needs hide their images under a triple covering, lest the
   people should be able to see them; and then, how would they be "the
   books of the unlearned" (idiotarum), as they call them? [142]

   Now, since the seraphim, of which Isaiah makes mention, (Isaiah 6:2,)
   signify the same as the cherubim, and are said "with twain of their
   wings to cover their faces, and with twain their feet," their images
   must be veiled, in order to correspond with them. Besides, it is
   preposterous, as I have said, forcibly to transfer these rudiments,
   which God delivered only to His ancient; people, to the fullness of
   time, when the Church has grown up and has passed out of its childhood.
   But how far the Jews were from worshipping the cherubim, the heathen
   poets bear them witness; for Juvenal, speaking of them, said,

   "Qui puras nubes, et coeli numen adorant;" [143]

   and God extorted these words from an impure and licentious man, that
   all might know that the Law of Moses lifted his disciples to things
   above. A threefold covering is then described, the inner one of goats'
   hair, another of rams' skins dyed red, and the outer one of badgers'
   skins; a wooden frame is then added, to strengthen the tabernacle
   within by its firmness, since otherwise the curtains would have got out
   of place at the slightest motion. The boards were of shittim-wood,
   overlaid with gold, either only gilt or covered with gold plates; each
   of them was supported by two silver bases, [144] like feet, and they
   were joined together by bars, passed through rings of gold. In this
   space the whole tabernacle was contained, which then was distinguished
   into the outer sanctuary and the Holy of holies. Besides these there
   was the court in which the people were to stand, because it was not
   lawful for them to enter the sanctuary, to which the priests alone had
   access, and they only when clean. Thus David, after having exclaimed,
   "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts," immediately adds,
   "My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord;" and
   again, "for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand," (Psalm
   84:1, 2, 10;) and again, "Worship the Lord in his holy court." [145]
   (Psalm 29:2.) But on so plain a matter there is no need of the abundant
   proofs which he furnishes. The disposition of the tabernacle is said
   again, in ver. 30, to have been shewn in the mount, that the people
   should not rest their attention on the visible tabernacle, but with the
   understanding of faith should penetrate to heaven, and direct their
   minds to the spiritual pattern, the shadows and types of which they
   beheld. Neither here must we philosophize too curiously. The allegory
   will please the ears of many, that by the two bases are meant the Old
   and New Testament, or the two natures of Christ, because believers rest
   on these two supports. But with no less probability we might say, that
   two bases were placed beneath each of the boards; either because
   godliness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come;
   or because we must resist on both sides the temptations which assail us
   from the right and from the left; or because faith must not limp nor
   turn to the right or left: thus there would be no bounds to trifling.
   They allegorically explain that the covering of the tabernacle was made
   of rams' skins, [146] because the Church is protected by the blood of
   Christ, who is the spotless lamb; but I ask, what do the badgers'
   skins, which were above, mean? Why was the covering of goats' hair put
   below? Wherefore, sobriety is our best course.

   31. And thou shalt make a vail. The inner shrine or recess was covered
   by one vail; the sanctuary was divided from the court by another. By
   both the people were admonished how reverently God's majesty must be
   regarded, and with what seriousness holy things are to be engaged in,
   so that they might not approach God's presence without fear, nor boldly
   break in upon the mysteries of things sacred. But by the vail the
   obscurity of the shadows of the Law was principally denoted, that the
   Israelites might know that the time of full revelation had not yet
   come, but that the spiritual worship of God was as yet enshrouded in a
   vail; and thus might extend their faith to their promised Messiah, at
   whose coming the truth would be discovered and laid bare. Wherefore,
   when Christ rose again from the dead, "the vail of the temple was rent
   in twain from the top to the bottom," (Matthew 27:51;) and an end was
   put to the ceremonies of the Law, because God then presented Himself in
   His living and express image, and the perfect reality of all the
   ceremonies was manifested. Now, therefore, in the light of the gospel,
   we behold "face to face," what was then shewn afar off to the ancient
   people under coverings. (2 Corinthians 3:14.) Yet, although there is
   now no vail to prevent us from openly and familiarly looking upon
   Christ, let us learn from this figure that the manifestation of God in
   the flesh is a hidden and incomprehensible mystery. (1 Timothy 3:16.)
   It is not without reason that Christ Himself compares His body to the
   temple, because the fullness of the Godhead dwells in it. (John 2:19.)
   Let us then know assuredly that the Father is in the Son, and the Son
   in the Father, (John 17:21;) but if it be asked in what manner, this is
   ineffable, except that the eternal Son of God, who, before the creation
   of the world, possessed the same glory with the Father, (John 17:5,)
   that even He is now man, that "He might be the firstborn among many
   brethren." (Romans 8:29.)

   Exodus 27

   Exodus 27:1-8

   1. And thou shalt make an altar ofshittim wood, five cubits long, and
   five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height
   thereof shall be three cubits.

   1. Facies etiam altare e lignis sittim: quinque cubitorum exit
   longitudo: et quinque cubitorum latitudo: quadrature erit altare: et
   trium cubitorum altitudo ejus.

   2. And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof:
   his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass.

   2. Huic facies cornua in quatuor angulis ejus: ex ipso erunt cornua
   ejus, tegesque illud aere.

   3. And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels,
   and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels
   thereof thou shalt make of brass.

   3. Facies deinde lebetes ejus: ad repurgandum cinerem ejus, et scopas
   (vel, forcipes) ejus, et crateras ejus, et fuscinulas ejus, et
   receptacula ejus: omnia vasa ejus facies ex aere.

   4. And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the
   net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof.

   4. Facies etiam illi craticulam opere craticulato aeream, et ad rete
   quatuor annulos, in quatuor extremitatibus ejus.

   5. And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that
   the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

   5. Ponesque illud sub ambitu altaris inferne, et erit rete illud usque
   ad medium altaris.

   6. And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood,
   and overlay them with brass.

   6. Facies praeterea vectes alta vectes e lignis sittim, et cooperies
   eos aere.

   7. And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be
   upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

   7. Et inserentur vectes ejus in illos annulos: et erunt vectes in
   utroque latere altaris, dum portabitur illud.

   8. Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the
   mount, so shall they make it.

   8. Cavum tabulis facies illud: quemadmodum ostendi tibi in monte, sic
   facient.


   1. And thou shalt make an altar. The altar of whole burnt-offerings
   (holocaustorum) is here described, which, however, it was called by
   synecdoche, for not only entire victims were burnt there, but also
   parts of them only, as we shall see in Leviticus. The burnt-offerings
   received their name from their ascending, [147] whereby the Israelites
   were reminded that they had need to be purified, that they might ascend
   to God; and at the same time were instructed that whatever corruption
   there might be in the flesh did not prevent the sacrifices from being
   acceptable and of a sweet savor to God. It is clear that from the first
   beginning of the human race there were burnt-sacrifices, suggested by
   the secret inspiration of God's Spirit, since there was no written Law;
   nor can we doubt but that by this symbol they were taught that the
   flesh must be burnt by the Spirit, in order that men may duly offer
   themselves to God; and thus they acknowledged, under this type, that
   the flesh of Christ must receive this from the divine power, so as to
   become a perfect victim for the propitiation of God; thus, as the
   Apostle testifies, he offered himself through the Spirit. (Hebrews
   9:14.) But fuller mention of this subject will be made elsewhere. The
   altar was so constructed that the sacrifices might be cast upon a grate
   placed within it, and thus they were covered by its external surface.
   The ashes were received into a pan, so that they should not fall about
   upon the ground and be trodden under foot, but that reverence might be
   inculcated even towards the very remnants of their holy things. [148]
   That the victims were bound to the four horns, which stood out from the
   four corners, is plain from the words of Psalm 118:27, "Bind the
   sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar." And this also
   is the beginning of a proper offering of spiritual sacrifices, that all
   the lusts of the flesh should be subdued, and held captive as it were
   unto the obedience of God. Wherefore even Christ, although in Him there
   was nothing which was not duly regulated, was nevertheless bound, in
   order to prove His obedience; as He had said, "Not as I will, but as
   thou wilt." (Matthew 26:39.) The altar was carried on staves, to
   obviate the necessity of having more than one; else there would have
   been danger of their being compelled, by the very difficulty of
   carrying it, to leave it behind after it was made, if they were setting
   about a long journey; and this would have been the seed or ground of
   superstition, whilst no other could be built which was not spurious.

   Exodus 27

   Exodus 27:9-19

   9. And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side
   southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of
   an hundred cubits long for one side:

   9. Facies insuper atrium tabernaculi ad plugam meridianam australem:
   cortinae erunt atrio e bysso retorta: centum cubitorum erit longitudo
   angulo uni.

   10. And the twentypillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of
   brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.

   10. Columnae autem ejus erunt viginti, et bases earum viginti aereae:
   capitella colunmarum et ilia earum argentea.

   11. And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings
   of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty
   sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

   11. Et sic lateri aquilonari in longitudine erunt cortinae centum, et
   columnm ejus viginti, basesque earum viginti rerem: capitella
   columnarum, et fila earum argentea.

   12. And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings
   of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.

   12. Porro in latitudine atrii ad latus occidentale, erunt cortinae
   quinquaginta cubitorum: et columnae earum erunt decem, et bases earum
   decem.

   13. And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be
   fifty cubits.

   13. In latitudine vero atrii in latere orientali ad orientem,
   quinquaginta cubiti erunt.

   14. The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their
   pillars three, and their sockets three.

   14. Qindecim autem cubitorum erunt tortinto lateri uni: columnae earum
   tres, basesque earum tres.

   15. And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their
   pillars three, and their sockets three.

   15. Lateri vero secundo quindecim cortinae: columnae earum tres, et
   bases earum tres.

   16. And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits,
   of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with
   needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four.

   16. Et portae atrii disponetur aulaeum viginti cubitorum ex hyacintho,
   et purpura, et vermiculo cocci, et bysso retorta, opere acupictoris:
   columnae ejus quatuor, basesque earum quatuor.

   17. All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with
   silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass.

   17. Omnes columnae atrii in circuitu cinctae erunt argento: capitella
   vero earum erunt argentea, et bases earum aerea.

   18. The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth
   fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine twined linen, and
   their sockets of brass.

   18. Longitudo atrii erit centum cubitorum, et latitudo quinquaginta in
   quinquaginta: altitudo autem quinque cubitorum: ex bysso retorta et
   bases earum aereae.

   19. All the vessels of the tabernacle, in all the service thereof, and
   all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.

   19. Omnia vasa tabernaculi in omni ministerio ejus, et omnes paxilli
   ejus, et omnes paxilli atrii, ex aeare.


   9. And thou shalt make the court. There were two courts divided from
   the sanctuary, one for the priests, the other common to the whole
   people. To the first chambers were annexed, in which the Levites dwelt,
   who were the keepers of the tabernacle; and thus sometimes the courts
   are spoken of in the plural number, and especially in the Psalms,
   (Psalm 64:4; 84:2; 92:13; 96:8.) It is the court of the people which is
   here referred to, where they consecrated the victims, offered their
   prayers, and were reconciled to God. In this manner the condition of
   mankind was shewn to the Israelites, by their being forbidden to enter
   the Temple, whilst at the same time they were reminded that men,
   although unworthy outcasts, are received by God, if only they seek Him
   simply, and with due humility, mindful of their own unworthiness. Hence
   the consolation in which David gloried, [149] "I had rather dwell in
   the courts of the Lord, than in the splendid tents of the ungodly." The
   court was formed by four curtains, two of which, on the north and south
   sides, were 100 cubits long, and supported by 20 pillars, whose bases
   were of brass, and their capitals [150] and fillets of silver; on the
   east and west, each curtain was 50 cubits long, supported by 10
   pillars. The length spoken of is not from the ground upwards, but from
   their opposite corners: for the court was twice as long as it was
   broad, as is said in ver. 18. There would be an appearance of
   contradiction in the fact that Moses afterwards speaks of two sides,
   and assigns fifteen cubits to each, if he did not immediately go on to
   mention the hanging or curtain, which covered the gate of the court,
   and which he sets at twenty cubits. Thus the measure will be correct,
   and the passage will be quite accordant; for, after he has said in ver.
   13 that the curtain on the east side should consist of fifty cubits, he
   adds in explanation that there were two curtains at the sides of the
   door, and a third between them to cover the door, making up in all the
   fifty cubits. But the door was covered by the hanging, that the
   Israelites might reflect in themselves, whenever they went into the
   sanctuary, that it was no profane or common (promiscuum) place; but if
   they came thither in purity and chastity, they might be assuredly
   persuaded that they were safe under the protection of God. Finally also
   the majesty of holy things was shewn them in this type, in order that
   they might reverently approach the worship of God; and they were
   reminded of their own unworthiness, that they might humble themselves
   the more before God, and that fear might beget penitence, whilst
   moderation in the desire of knowledge was recommended to them, that
   they might not be unduly inquisitive. The religion of the Gentiles also
   had its secret shrines with the same object, but for very different
   causes; for it was a brutal religion, for which veneration was sought
   by darkness, and the disguise of ignorance; whereas God, whilst He
   retained His people in modesty and simplicity, at the same time set
   before them the Law, from which they might learn whatever it was right
   and useful for them to know.

   Exodus 29

   Exodus 29:36, 37

   36. And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin-offering for
   atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an
   atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

   36. Juvencum pro peccato facies in singulos dies pro expiationibus: et
   expiabis altare expiando ipsum, ungesque illud ad ipsum sanctificandum.

   37. Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify
   it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar
   shall be holy.

   37. Septem diebus expiabis altare et sanctificabis illud: eritque
   sanctitas sanctitatum: quicquid tetigerit altare, sanctificabitur.


   36. And thou shalt offer every day a bullock. Since the ancient altar
   was no less a type of Christ than the priest was, it may naturally be
   asked, what its expiation could mean, as if there were anything impure
   or polluted in Christ. But we must remember, what I before adverted to,
   that no similitude is identical (with the reality); for then the
   substance and reality of the shadows could not be represented in their
   perfection. Yet this was an apt similitude, shewing that God could only
   be propitiated towards the human race by an expiation made with blood.
   On this account not only was the altar to be cleansed, but; also
   dedicated to its use, that reconciliation might proceed from it; and
   this is expressed by the word "sanctify," especially when it is added,
   "it shall be the holiness of holinesses," [151] that it may sanctify
   whatever is put upon it. Others read it in the masculine gender:
   "Whosoever shall touch it, shall be holy;" and understand it of the
   priest, who by right of his anointing might approach the altar; but; it
   rather dignifies the consecration of the altar by its consequence,
   viz., because it sanctifies the victims themselves. The sum is that the
   body of Christ, inasmuch as it was offered as a sacrifice, and
   consecrated with blood, was acceptable to God; so that its holiness
   washes away and blots out all our uncleanness. We shall speak of the
   anointing a little further on.

   Exodus 30

   Exodus 30:1-10

   1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood
   shalt thou make it.

   1. Facies et altare suffimenti suffitus, ex lignis Sittim facies illud.

   2. A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
   thereof; four-square shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height
   thereof; the horns thereof shall be of the same.

   2. Cubitus longitudo ejus, et cubitus latitudo ejus, quadratum erit: et
   duo cubiti altitudo ejus: ex ipso cornua ejus.

   3. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the
   sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make
   unto it a crown of gold round about.

   3. Teges illud auto puro, tectum ejus vel parietes ejus per circuitum,
   et cornua ejus: faciesque ei coronam auream per circuitum.

   4. And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by
   the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it;
   and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

   4. Duos etiam annulos aureos facies ei infra coronam ejus, in duobus
   angulis ejus, in utroque latere ejus: et per illos trajicientur vectes
   ad illud cum ipsis portandum.

   5. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
   with gold.

   5. Facies autem vectes illos ex lignis sittim, et teges eos auro.

   6. And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
   testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I
   will meet with thee.

   6. Et pones illud ante velum, quod erit juxta aream testimonii, ante
   propitiatorium, quod erit super testimonium, ubi conveniam tecum.

   7. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
   dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

   7. Et adolebit super illud Aharon suffitum aromatum singulis matutinis,
   quando aptabit lucernas adolebit illum.

   8. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense
   upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your
   generations.

   8. Et quando accendet Aharon lucernas inter duas vesperas, adolebit
   suffitum illum jugiter coram Jehova in generationibus vestris.

   9. Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor
   meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

   9. Non offeretis super illud suffitum alium, neque holocaustum, neque
   minha: sed nec libamen libabitis super illud.

   10. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a
   year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year
   shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most
   holy unto the LORD.

   10. Et expiabit Aharon super cornua ejus semel in anno sanguine
   oblationis pro peccato expiationum: semel in anno expiabit super illud
   in generationibus vestris. Sanctitas sanctitatum est Jehovae.


   1. And thou shalt make an altar. God now issues His commands respecting
   the altar of burnt incense, whereby the people were assured that the
   odor of the worship under the Law was sweet to Him. This ceremony
   indeed also prevailed among the Gentiles; whence there is frequent
   mention made by heathen authors of incense-burning; but what its object
   was they knew not themselves, nor did they care to reflect upon its
   proper intention, since they conceived themselves to have done all that
   was required of them, by the bare sign itself. In this way, however,
   God would encourage His believing people, by giving them to know that
   the worship which they offered at this command sent up to him a sweet
   savor. Meanwhile He admonished them diligently to beware lest any
   uncleanness should profane their sacrifices, but that they should come
   cleansed and pure into His sight. And David applies this type specially
   to prayer, when he says:

   "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense."
   (Psalm 131:2.)

   Therefore, as the other altar of which we have been hearing, was
   devoted to the victims for the purpose of propitiating God, so also
   this altar perfumed the sacrifices with the odor of its incense, that
   they might be acceptable to God. Hence it was placed near the ark of
   the testimony, though with the vail between, that its savor might
   ascend directly to God without any let or hindrance. There is no
   ambiguity in the words, except that some think there is a repetition
   where it is said, "every morning," and "between the two evens;" [152]
   others suppose that there are two separate oblations, and this latter
   view is the more probable, i.e., that the incense was offered morning
   and evening. He afterwards forbids either the altar itself to be
   transferred to other uses, or any other kind of incense to be burnt
   upon it; of this he will speak elsewhere.

   10. And Aaron shall make an atonement. We should observe here the
   correspondence between the two altars; for, as the Israelites were
   admonished that the sacrifices would not please God, unless all
   uncleanness were wiped away by pure and holy prayers, so also the altar
   of incense was purified by the sprinkling of blood, that they might
   learn that their prayers obtained acceptance through sacrifices.
   Although this was only done once a year, yet it was daily to be called
   to mind, in order that they might offer the death of Christ by faith
   and prayer, [153] and yet might know that their prayers had no sweet
   savor, unless in so far as they were sprinkled with the blood of
   atonement.

   Exodus 30:34-38

   34. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte,
   and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of
   each shall there be a like weight:

   34. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Accipe tibi aromata, stacten, et onychen,
   et galbanum, aromata, et thus purum: ut pondus ponderi respondeat.

   35. And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the
   apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

   35. Et facies ex eo suffimentum aromaticum, opus aromatarii, mistum,
   purum et sanctum.

   36. And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the
   testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with
   thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

   36. Et contundes ex eo comminuendo: ponesque ex eo coram testimonio in
   tabernaculo conventionis, in quo conveniam tecum: sanctitas sanctitatum
   erit vobis.

   37. And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to
   yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee
   holy for the LORD.

   37. Suffimentum quod facies secundum compositionem ejus non facietis
   vobis: sanctitas tibi erit Jehovae.

   38. Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even
   be cut off from his people.

   38. Quisquis fecerit simile ad adolendum ilhd, excidetur e populis
   suis.


   34. Take unto thee sweet spices. This oblation might have been noticed
   with the others, yet, since it merely describes the composition of the
   incense, which is connected with the altar of incense, and in fact is
   but an appendage to it, I have seen no reason why I should separate
   them. Let the curious subtilely discuss, if they please, the
   ingredients themselves; it is enough for me that they were chosen at
   God's will to make a very sweet smell. For I know not whether it is
   likely, as some suppose, that galbanum [154] is of a strong and
   disagreeable savor, and, since they only offer this conjecture in an
   unknown matter, they deserve little credit. My conviction is that it
   was sweet, which the words of Moses himself a little further on
   confirm, where he denounces the penalty of death upon those who should
   use such perfume for their private gratification; for this prohibition
   would have been absurd, unless its odor had been very agreeable.
   Besides, the analogy between the sign and the thing signified would not
   have held good, unless its sweet savor had testified that God is
   greatly pleased with the prayers of His people. Moreover, in order that
   the sacred symbol might be the more reverenced, it was not allowable to
   transfer this mixture to private use; for since men are rude and
   earthly-minded, there is nothing they are more prone to than to mix up
   heavenly things with those of earth. Therefore, to elevate their minds
   the more, it was necessary that the incense, in which there was a
   special holiness due to God alone, should be set apart from common use.

   Exodus 30:17-21

   17. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   17. Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   18. Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass,
   to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the
   congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

   18. Facies et concham aeneam, et basin ejus aeneam ad lavandum,
   ponesque illam inter tabernaculum conventionis et altare, et pones
   aquam ill ea.

   19. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
   thereat:

   19. Lavabuntque ex ea Aharon et filii ejus manus suas et pedes suos.

   20. When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall
   wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar
   to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:

   20. Quando ingredientur tabernaculum conventionis lavabunt se aqua, ut
   non moriantur: aut quum appropinquabunt ad altare, ut ministrent, ut
   incendant oblationem ignitam Jehovae.

   21. So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not:
   and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed
   throughout their generations.

   21. Lavabunt inquam manus suas et pedes suos, ne moriantur: eritque
   illis statutum perpetuum, ei scilicet et semini ejus per generationes
   suas.


   18. Thou shalt also make a laver of brass. Although this oblation was a
   sign of the purity which God required in His priests, yet, inasmuch as
   this hollow vessel (concha) or laver, which supplied the water, was a
   part or utensil of the sanctuary, I have thought it best to insert here
   what is ordained respecting it, not only as to its fashion, but also
   its use, which could not be well separated: for if bare mention had
   only been made of a laver or water-vessel, [155] the reader would have
   received no profit from it. But, when God expressly commands that water
   should always be ready in this basin for the priests to wash their
   hands and feet, we gather from hence with what reverence and sanctity
   God would have His holy service performed. It was, indeed, a common
   proverb among the Gentiles that they were guilty of impiety who handled
   holy things with unwashen hands, and they testified in this ceremony
   that they could not worship God aright except when purified from all
   pollution and uncleanness. One in Virgil says: --

   "------ donec me flumine vivo Abluero." [156]

   "Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt
   Of dire debate and blood in battle spilt." -- Dryden.

   And such expressions are of constant occurrence. Sometimes they even
   seemed almost to hit the right point; as where the poet commands the
   ungodly and the criminal to depart from the sacrifices, lest they
   should contaminate them; [157] but this was only a fleeting
   imagination, since no anxiety to repent had awakened in them a desire
   to propitiate God; and so, even whilst they were diligent in performing
   ablutions, their minds, darkened with error, knew not what it meant.
   But the Israelites were thus chiefly reminded how unworthy they were to
   offer sacrifices to God, since the impurity of the very priests, who
   were chosen to this once, prevented them from exercising it, until they
   were cleansed with water. The washing of the hands and feet denoted
   that all parts of the body were infected with uncleanness; for, since
   Scripture often uses the word "hands" for the actions of life, and
   compares the whole course of life to a way or journey, it is very
   suitable to say by synecdoche that all impurity is purged away by the
   washing of the hands and feet. The comparison with Christ now remains
   to be considered; but this we shall understand better a little beyond
   in reference to the sacrifices.

   pro filiis Israel: et feret Aharon nomina eorum coram Jehova in duobus
   humeris suis ad memoriam.

   13. And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

   14. Et duas catenas ex auro puro terminatas, facies opere plectili,
   inseresque catenas plectiles palis illis.

   15. And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work;

   16. Quadratum erit et duplicatum: palmus erit longitudo ejus: et palmus
   latitudo ejus.

   17. And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
   stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle:
   this shall be the first row.

   21. And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel,
   twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet;
   every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.

   21. Porro lapides illi erunt juxta nomina filiorum Israel, duodecim,
   secundum nomina ipsorum, sculpturis annuli singuli juxta nomen suum,
   erunt duodecim tribubus.

   wreathen work of pure gold.

   22. Facies et in pectorali catenas termini opere plectili ex auro puro.

   before it.

   25. Et duas extremitates duarum catenarum inseres duabus palis, et
   pones in lateribus ephod a fronte ipsius.

   26. And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon
   the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the
   side of the ephod inward.

   26. Facies et duos annulos aureos, quos pones in duabus extremitatibus
   ipsius pectoralis in ora ejus, quse est in latere ipsius ephod
   intrinsecus.

   27. And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on
   the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof,
   over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of
   the ephod.

   27. Facies item duos altos annulos aureos, quos pones in duobus
   lateribus ipsius ephod inferne a fronte ejus, e regione conjunctionis
   ejus, supra baltheum ephod.

   28. And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the
   rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the
   curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed
   from the ephod.

   28. Ita jungent pectorale annulis suis ad annulos ipsius ephod filo
   hyacinthino, supra baltheum ipsius ephod, neque separetur pectorale ab
   ephod.

   29. And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the
   breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy
   place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.

   supra cor suum, quando ingredietur in sanctuarium in memoriam coram
   Jehova jugiter.

   30. And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the
   Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before
   the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel
   upon his heart before the LORD continually.

   30. Pones autem in pectorali judicii Urim et Thummim, ut sint super cor
   Aharon quando ingredietur coram Jehova: gestabitque Aharon judicium
   filiorum Israel super cot suum coram Jehova semper.

   31. And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

   31. Facies et pallium ipsius ephod totum ex hyacintho.

   32. And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof:
   it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it
   were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.

   32. Et erit foramen sumrose parris ejus in medio ejus: labrum erit
   foramini illius in circuitu opere textoris, sicut foramen loricae erit
   el, ne rumpatur.

   33. And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
   blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and
   bells of gold between them round about:

   33. Facies et in fimbriis ejus malogranata ex hyacintho, et purpura, et
   vermiculo cocci: in fimbriis, inquam, ejus per circuitum, et
   tintinnabula aurea in medio per circuitum.

   34. A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate,
   upon the hem of the robe round about.

   34. Tintinnabulum aureum unum et malogranatum, tintinnabulum aureum
   alterum et malogranatum in fimbriis pallii per circuitum.

   35. And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
   heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he
   cometh out, that he die not.

   35. Erit autem Aharon ad ministrandum, et audietur sonus ejus quando
   ingredietur sanctuarium coram Jehova, et quando egredietur: et non
   morietur.

   36. And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like
   the engravings of a signet, Holiness To The Lord.

   36. Facies insuper laminam ex auto puro, et sculpes in ea sculpturis
   annuli. Sanctitas ipsi Jehovae.

   37. And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
   mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

   37. Quam pones in filo hyacinthino, eritque super cidarim, ex adverso
   faciei cidaris erit.

   38. And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
   iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow
   in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that
   they may be accepted before the LORD.

   38. Et erit supra frontem Aharon, feretque Aharon iniquitatem
   sanctificationum quas sanctificabunt filii Israel in omnibus muneribus
   sanctificationum suarum: erit inquam supra frontem ejus jugiter in
   beneplacitum els coram Jehova.

   39. And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt
   make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of
   needlework.

   39. Et facies opere ocellato tunicam byssinam, facies item cidarim
   byssinam, cingulum quoque facies opere phrygionico.

   40. And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for
   them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for
   beauty.

   40. Filiis autem Aharon facies tunicas, facies quoque illis cingula et
   pileos ad gloriam et decorum.

   41. And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
   him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them,
   that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   41. Et vesties illis Aharon fratrem tuum, et filios ejus cure illo,
   atque unges illos: implebisque manum eorum, et sanctificabis cos, ut
   sacerdotio fungantur mihi.

   42. And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness;
   from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:

   42. Fac eis et feminalia linea ad tegendam carnem turpitudinis: a
   lumbis usque ad femora erunt,

   43. And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in
   unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto
   the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity,
   and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after
   him.

   43. Eruntque super Aharon et super filios ejus quando ingredientur
   tabernaculum conventionis, aut quum accedent ad altare ut ministrent in
   sanctuario: et non ferent iniquitatem, neque morientur. Statutum
   perpetuum illi et semini ejus post eum.


   We now arrive at the second part of the Legal Worship, i.e., the
   Priesthood; for we must bear in mind what I have said, that there are
   three things to be considered, --

   1. The Tabernacle;

   2. The Priestly Office; and

   3. The Sacrifices.

   And indeed all the splendor of the tabernacle, of which we have been
   speaking, would have been an empty parade without the priest, who so
   mediated as an intercessor, that he reconciled men to God, and in a
   manner united heaven to earth. Now it is unquestionable, that the
   Levitical priests were the representatives of Christ; since, with
   respect to their office, they were even better than the very angels;
   which would be by no means reasonable, unless they had been the type of
   Him, who is Himself the head of the angels. The heathen nations, it is
   true, had their priests, who presided over their religious services,
   but they were but empty phantoms; for there was no mention with them of
   the Mediator, so that the people might know that God cannot be duly
   appeased, and that our prayers cannot be heard by Him, unless a
   peace-maker interfere between us. But the nature of the Levitical
   priesthood was widely different; for the Israelites were instructed
   that all of them were unworthy to stand before God, and so that there
   was need of an Intercessor to propitiate Him. Now, since the general
   rule had been laid down, that all things should be rigidly referred to
   the pattern which had been shewn to Moses in the mount, their minds
   were necessarily drawn upwards; and this too they might easily have
   arrived at, for various reasons. The whole body of the people saw a man
   like themselves, who could not enter the sanctuary trusting in his own
   innocence, and whose dignity was conferred upon him by adventitious
   rites; i.e., by anointing, and by investiture. The full truth,
   therefore, did not shine forth in this, but only a figure to direct
   them to the truth; and of this they were doubtless admonished, lest
   they should rest in earthly things. Besides, its interpretation was
   added (by the prophets [158] ); because, as the Apostle wisely teaches
   us in the Epistle to Hebrews 7:18, the promise to appoint hereafter a
   priest after the order of Melchisedec would not hold good, unless it
   were applied to Christ; for it is plain that the Levitical priesthood
   is there brought into comparison by contrast with one of a different
   nature; and since the latter is eternal, it follows that the former is
   temporary; and, whilst the one is sanctioned by an oath, it clearly is
   superior to the other. There is no doubt, then, but that David, as a
   faithful interpreter of the Law, more manifestly shewed forth what
   there was obscurely shadowed.

   Thus far my wish has been to teach that the Levitical priest was
   ordained, that he might be a type of the true Mediator. It will now be
   worth our while briefly to advert to the marks by which our perpetual
   and only Priest, the Son of God, is to be distinguished from those of
   old; for a fuller exposition will follow hereafter in its proper place.
   The first distinction I have already pointed out, viz., that the type
   was temporary; since perpetuity is only to be sought in the reality
   itself: whence we learn that the priestly office was not so instituted
   by Moses to last for ever, but to direct the people to a better hope.
   But what I have said as to the office, must be transferred also to the
   persons. There was only one high priest under the Law, who was
   afterwards succeeded by one of his race, since they were all mortal.
   None, then, was ever such a priest as became us, except Christ; because
   none other could be perpetual; and hence we arrive at the second
   distinction. The third arises from Christ's divinity, which is proved
   by the fact, that the priest after the order of Melchisedec has no
   beginning; for we find nowhere the origin of Melchisedec; but he is
   only brought forward once and unexpectedly, as if be had come down from
   heaven. The fourth is the combination of the kingdom and the
   priesthood. Under the Law God would have some to be kings, and others
   to be priests; nor was it allowable to mix up the one office with the
   other; but He, of whom it is said that He should be a priest like
   Melchisedec, is honored with the title of king. The fifth is, that the
   legal priest only appeared before God in the visible and sanctuary, but
   Christ entered into heaven, to present us to His Father, not in the
   external symbols of (precious) stones, [159] but in the reality itself;
   for in Him as our Head we are all gathered together unto God. The sixth
   lies in the perfect righteousness of Christ; for the legal priest,
   since he was one of us sinners, had need to seek pardon for himself;
   but Christ, being free from all guilt, awakens favor towards us by His
   own purity. The seventh is, that the priest borrowed from external
   figures what was truly and really shewn forth in Christ. The sacred
   garments, as we have lately said, denoted something more than human;
   the anointing, too, was a symbol of the Spirit which dwells in Christ;
   and He therefore was not consecrated with visible and corruptible oil,
   but with the fullness of all gifts. The priest of old abstained from
   intercourse with his wife when he went into the sanctuary; he was only
   allowed to marry a virgin; the perfect and spiritual purity of Christ
   was contented with its own perfection. The last distinction consisted
   in the sacrifices themselves, respecting which I abstain at present
   from speaking more fully, because they will have their proper place
   hereafter. This only we must now recollect, that Christ expiated the
   sins of the world, not with the blood of beasts, but with His own
   blood. Now we turn to the words of Moses.

   1. And take thou unto thee Aaron. The calling of God is here alleged to
   prove the importance and dignity of the priesthood, and this too the
   Apostle has well weighed in the words:

   "And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but he that is called of
   God, as was Aaron." (Hebrews 5:4.)

   Among heathen nations the priests were appointed by popular election,
   so that ambition alone governed their appointment; but God would only
   have those accounted lawful priests whom He had selected at His own
   sole will; and surely the whole human race together had no power to
   obtrude any one on God, who should interpose himself to obtain pardon
   and peace; nay, not even Christ Himself would have been sufficient to
   propitiate God, unless He had undertaken the office by the decree and
   appointment of His Father. To which refers the famous oath, whereby His
   heavenly Father appointed Him to be priest; and so much the more vile
   and detestable was the sacrilege which afterwards prevailed in the
   Jewish nation, viz., that the successors of Aaron bought the
   priesthood! This unworthy traffic of the office, which Josephus
   relates, ought to awaken horror in us now, when we see that sacred
   honor profaned by the family which had been chosen by God to represent
   Christ. Nevertheless, however they may have violated all law and
   justice, still the counsel of God remained inviolable, that believers
   might know that the priesthood depended on His authority, just as
   reconciliation flows from His mere mercy. For in order that it should
   be lawful for men to establish a priest, it would be necessary that
   they should anticipate God by their own deservings; and from this they
   are very far distant. The case is different as to the election of the
   pastors of the Church; since, after Christ had instituted the order
   itself, He commanded that there should be chosen out of the Church
   those who by their doctrine and integrity of life were fitted to
   exercise the office. Still He does not thus resign His own right and
   power to men, for He does not cease through them to call those (by whom
   He would be served. [160] ) Wherefore, to shew that He is the sole
   author of the priesthood, God commands Aaron and his sons to be
   separated from among the others; and the performance of this He
   entrusts to Moses, whom, however, He does not elevate to the like
   honor. Moses consecrates Aaron, although he was never himself dedicated
   by anointing and investiture to the service of God; [161] whence we
   perceive that the sacraments have their power and effect not from the
   virtue of the minister, but only from the commandment of God; for Moses
   would not have given to others what he had not himself, if it had not
   so pleased God.

   2. And thou shalt make holy garments. These external ornaments denoted
   the want of those which are true and spiritual; for if the priest had
   been absolutely and entirely perfect, these typical accessories would
   have been superfluous. But God would shew by this symbol the more than
   angelical brightness of all virtues which was to be exhibited in
   Christ. Aaron was defiled by his own corruption, and therefore unworthy
   to appear in the presence of God; in order, then, that he might be a
   fit peacemaker between God and man, he put off his ordinary garments,
   and stood forth as a new man. Hence the holy garments were, first of
   all, supposed to conceal his faults; and, secondly, to represent the
   incomparable adornment of all virtues. The latter may indeed be in some
   measure applied to the pastors of the Church; nor will the comparison
   be absurd, if we say that no others are worthy of so excellent an
   honor, except those in whom surpassing and extraordinary virtue
   brightly manifests itself. But we must chiefly recollect what I have
   said, viz., that in these garments the supreme purity and wondrous
   glory of Christ were represented; as if God should promise that the
   Mediator would be far more august than the condition of man could
   produce. He therefore declares that they shall be "for glory and for
   beauty." We shall speak more fully hereafter, what I will touch upon
   now, as to the wisdom of the artificers, viz., that all who from the
   foundation of the world have invented arts useful to the human race,
   have been imbued with the Spirit of God; so that even heathen authors
   have been compelled to call them the inventions of the gods. But
   inasmuch as in this Divine work there was need of rare and unwonted
   skill, it is expressly spoken of as a peculiar gift of the Spirit.

   4. And these are the garments. Here again I must remind my readers,
   that they should abandon all subtle speculations, and be contented with
   simplicity. I might repeat many plausible allegories, which perhaps
   would find more favor with some than a sound knowledge of facts. If any
   should delight in this kind of child's play, let him only read what
   Jerome wrote to Fabiola; in which he collected almost everything that
   he possibly could from the writings of others; but nothing will be
   found except dull trifling, the folly of which it is painful even to
   report, much more to refute. Those who are conversant with my writings,
   are aware that I do not willingly find fault with the opinions of
   others; but when I reflect how dangerous are those itching ears, with
   which many are troubled, I am obliged to prescribe this remedy. Six
   principal parts of the dress are enumerated. What the Greeks call the
   logeion, and the Latins the pectorale, was like a square breastplate
   attached by small chains, so as to be connected with the ephod.
   Inclosed in it were twelve stones to represent the tribes of Israel;
   and the Urim and Thummim were also annexed to it. But what its form
   might be, cannot be certainly declared from the words of Moses; and
   since even the Jews also differ among themselves, let us be satisfied
   with its comparison to a breastplate. I have no objection to the
   opinion, that its name [162] was derived from strength, or a treasure.
   But this is worthy of the utmost attention, that the priest bore the
   sons of Abraham as it were upon his heart, not only that he might
   present them to God, but that he might be mindful of them, and anxious
   for their welfare. The twelve precious stones were by no means given to
   be symbols of the twelve tribes as a cause for awakening their pride,
   as if they were so highly esteemed on the score of their own dignity or
   excellence; but they were thus reminded that the whole value, in which
   believers are held by God, is derived from the sanctity of the
   priesthood. Therefore, let us learn from this figure, that:, however
   vile and abject we may be in ourselves, and so altogether worthless
   refuse, yet inasmuch as Christ deigned to ingraft us into this body, in
   Him we are precious stones. And to this Isaiah seems to allude in the
   passage before cited, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church,
   which was to take place under the reign of Christ, he says, "Behold, I
   will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with
   sapphires; and I will make thy windows with carbuncles, and all thy
   borders with pleasant stones;" for immediately after the exposition
   follows, "And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord." (Isaiah
   54:11-13.) Therefore what was to be fulfilled in Christ, was typified
   by the external sign under the Law; viz., that though we sojourn in the
   world, yet are we united with Christ by faith, as if we were one with
   Him; and, besides, that He takes care for our welfare, as if He bore us
   enclosed in His heart; and, finally, that when our heavenly Father
   regards us in Him, He esteems us above all the wealth and splendor of
   the world.

   As to the Urim and Thummim, it appears probable to me that they were
   two conspicuous marks on the breastplate, corresponding to these names;
   for the supposition of some of the Jews, [163] that the ineffable name
   of God was placed beneath its texture, is not free from foolish and
   dangerous superstition. I pass over other fancies, which are equally
   frivolous; nor am I anxious to know what was the form of either of
   them; the fact itself is sufficient for me. By the Urim, therefore, or
   splendors, I doubt not but that the light of doctrine, wherewith the
   true Priest illuminates all believers, was represented; first, because
   He is the one "light of the world," without which all things are full
   of darkness; and because in Him "are hid all the treasures of wisdom
   and knowledge." (John 8:12; 9:5; Colossians 2:3.) Hence did Paul justly
   glory that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ, (1 Corinthians 2:2,) since
   His priesthood sufficiently and more than sufficiently enlightens us.
   As then the people were admonished that their eyes should be directed
   to the splendor of the priest, so now we must diligently remember what
   Christ Himself teaches, that "he that followeth him shall not walk in
   darkness." (John 8:12.) On the other hand, the Thummim, which signifies
   perfections, was a symbol of the perfect and entire purity which is
   only to be sought in Christ; for He would not have been a meet high
   priest unless He had been perfect, free from every spot, and deficient
   in nothing which is required unto complete holiness. It is not, then,
   an improper distinction, that the Urim refers to the light of doctrine,
   and the Thummim to the life; and this is indeed in some measure
   applicable to the pastors of the Church, who ought to shine both in
   sound doctrine and in integrity of life. But it was God's design to
   shew that neither of these things is to be sought anywhere except in
   Christ; since from Him we obtain both light and purity, when He deigns
   to make us partakers of them according to the measure of His free
   bounty. Whence it follows, that they who seek for the least spark of
   light or drop of purity out of Christ, plunge themselves into a
   labyrinth, where they wander in mortal darkness, and inhale the deadly
   fumes of false virtues unto their own destruction.

   What the Scripture sometimes relates, as to the inquiries made by Urim
   and Thummim, it was a concession made by God to the rudeness of His
   ancient people. The true Priest had not yet appeared, the Angel of His
   Almighty counsel, by whose Spirit all the Prophets spoke, who, finally,
   is the fountain of all revelations, and the express image of the
   Father; in order then that the typical priest might be the messenger
   from God to man, it behooved him to be invested with the ornaments of
   Christ. Thus even then believers were taught in a figure, that Christ
   is the way by which we come to the Father, and that He also brings from
   the secret bosom of His Father whatever it is profitable for us to know
   unto salvation, hence that fiction of the Jews is contradicted, that
   the responses were given in this way: if a question was asked
   respecting a particular tribe, that the stone which represented it was
   lighted up; and that the colors of the stones were changed according as
   God refused or assented. For even if we allow that the Urim and Thummim
   were the rows of precious stones themselves, still this imagination is
   altogether unmeaning. But, as I have said, by the very form of the
   breastplate God would testify that the fulness of wisdom and integrity
   was contained in it; for which reason it is called "the breastplate of
   judgment," i.e., of the most perfect rectitude, which left nothing to
   be desired; for the word mspht mishphot, often signifies in Scripture
   whatsoever is well and duly ordered. The interpretation which some
   give, that "judgment" means "inquiry," because the priest only asked
   for responses when he had the breastplate on, is too restricted, and is
   even proved to be erroneous by sundry passages. Let this then be deemed
   settled, that this honorable appellation is meant to express a correct
   and infallible rule (ordinem.) Because the breastplate was, as it were,
   a part of the ephod, it is therefore sometimes comprehended in that
   word; in which it may be well also to observe, that this peculiar ephod
   of the high priest's was different from the others, of which mention is
   made elsewhere; for all of the sacerdotal lineage wore an ephod in the
   performance of religious duties. (1 Samuel 14:3; 23:6.) Even David,
   when he danced before the Ark, wore his ephod, (2 Samuel 6:14;) and
   this custom is still retained by the Jews at their chief festivals. The
   rest I will introduce presently in their proper places.

   9. And thou shalt take two onyx-stones. That the connection between the
   priest and the people might be made more plain, God not only placed on
   his breast the memorials of the twelve tribes, but also engraved their
   names on his shoulders. Thus all occasion of envy was removed, since
   the people would understand that this one man was not separated from
   the others for the sake of private advantage, but that in his one
   person they were all a kingdom of priests, which Peter teaches to have
   been at length really fulfilled in Christ, (1 Peter 2:5;) as Isaiah had
   foretold that there should be priests of God, and Levites brought from
   the Gentiles, (Isaiah 66:21;) to which John makes allusion in the
   Apocalypse, where he says that we are all priests in Christ,
   (Revelation 1:6.) But we must remember the reason why our High Priest
   is said to bear us on His shoulders, for we not only crawl on earth,
   but we are plunged in the lowest depths of death; how then should we be
   able to ascend to heaven, unless the Son of God should raise us up with
   Him; Now, since there is no ability in us unto eternal life, but all
   our powers of mind and body lie prostrate, we must be borne up by His
   strength alone. Hence then arises our confidence of ascending to
   heaven, because Christ raises us up with Him; as Paul says, we "sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus," (Ephesians 2:6;) however
   weak then we may be in ourselves, herein is all our strength, that we
   are His burden. Therefore in this old type was prefigured what Paul
   teaches, that the Church is "his body," and "the fullness of him,"
   (Ephesians 1:22.) It remains that each of us, conscious of our own
   weakness, should rest on Christ; for when in foolish arrogance we exalt
   ourselves, we do not suffer ourselves to be lifted up by Him, to be
   borne and sustained by His power. Let the proud then, by lifting
   themselves on high, fall down in ruin, whilst Christ supports us upon
   His shoulders. These stones are called "stones of memorial;" and again,
   "for a memorial" to the children of Israel; as is also afterwards
   repeated of the twelve stones; which some expound, that "God may be
   mindful of the children of Israel;" others, that "the priest himself
   may remember them;" others, that "the children of Israel may remember
   that God is reconciled to them for the sake of the one Mediator;" but I
   simply interpret it, that they were a monument of the mutual agreement
   between God and them; as if God would shew by a visible sign that He
   embraced them and received them into His sanctuary, as often as they
   were offered in this manner.

   30. And thou shalt put in the breastplate. From these words some infer
   that the Urim and Thummim were distinct from the whole work, which is
   before described; others think that they were the twelve stones,
   because no mention will be made of them when Moses relates that the
   whole was completed. But nothing is more probable, as I have already
   said, than that on the breastplate itself some representation was given
   of light in doctrine, and of entire uprightness of life; and therefore
   after Moses has called it "the breastplate of judgment," he also speaks
   of it as "the judgment of the children of Israel;" by which expression
   he means a certain and defined system, or an absolutely perfect rule,
   to which the children of Israel ought to direct and conform themselves.

   31. And thou shalt make the robe. This robe was above the oblong coat
   between that and the ephod; and from its lower edge hung the bells and
   pomegranates alternately. Although there was no smell in the
   pomegranates, [164] yet the type suggested this to the eyes; as if God
   required in that garment a sweet smell as well as a sound; and surely
   we who stink through the foulness of our sins, are only a sweet smell
   unto God as being covered with the garment of Christ. But God would
   have the bells give a sound; because the garment of Christ does not
   procure favor for us, except by the sound of the Gospel, which diffuses
   the sweet savor of the Head amongst all the members. In this allegory
   there is nothing too subtle or far-fetched; for the similitude of the
   smell and the sound naturally leads us to the honoring of grace, [165]
   and to the preaching of the Gospel. By the pomegranates, therefore,
   which were attached to the hem of the garment, God testified that
   whatever was in the priest smelt sweetly, and was acceptable to Him,
   provided the sound accompanied it; the necessity of which is declared,
   when God denounces death against the priest if He should enter the
   sanctuary without the sound. And assuredly it was a general invitation
   which awakened the peoples' minds to attention, whilst the sacred
   offices were performed. There is no absurdity in the fact, that the
   punishment which God threatens does not properly apply to Christ;
   because it was necessary to issue severe injunctions to the Levitical
   priests, lest they should omit these external exercises of piety, until
   the truth was manifested. The ancients do not unwisely make a spiritual
   application of this to the ministers of the Church; for the priest is
   worthy of death, says Gregory, [166] from whom the voice of preaching
   is not heard; just as Isaiah reproves "the dumb dogs." (Isaiah 56:10.)
   But this we must especially remember, that the garment of Christ is
   sonorous, since only faith, which cometh by hearing, clothes us with
   His righteousness.

   36. And thou shalt make a plate. It is not without reason that this
   inscription is placed upon the priest's forehead, that it may be
   conspicuous; for not only did God thus testify that the legal
   priesthood was approved of, and acceptable to Him, since He had
   consecrated it by His word, but also that holiness was not to be sought
   elsewhere. These two things, then, are to be observed, -- first, that
   the priesthood of His own appointment is pleasing to God, and so, that
   all others, however magnificently they may be spoken of, are abominable
   to Him, and rejected by Him; and secondly, that out of Christ we are
   all corrupt, and all our worship faulty; and however excellent our
   actions may seem, that they are still unclean and polluted. Thus,
   therefore, let all our senses remain fixed on the forehead of our sole
   and perpetual Priest, that we may know that from Him alone purity flows
   throughout the whole Church. To this His words refer,

   "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified
   through the truth." (John 17:19;)

   and the same thing is expressed in this passage of Moses, "that Aaron
   may hear the iniquity of the holy things," etc. It is undoubtedly a
   remarkable passage, whereby, we are taught that nothing proceeds from
   us pleasing to God except through the intervention of the grace of the
   Mediator; for here there is no reference to manifest and gross sins,
   [167] the pardon of which it is clear that we can only obtain through
   Christ; but the iniquity of the holy oblations was to be taken away and
   cleansed by the priest. That is but a poor exposition of it, that if
   any error were committed in the ceremonies, it was remitted in answer
   to the prayers of the priest; for we must look further, and understand
   that on this account the iniquity of the offerings must be purged by
   the priest, because no offering, in so far as it is of man, is
   altogether free from guilt. This is a harsh saying, and almost a
   paradox, that our very holinesses are so impure as to need pardon; but
   it must be borne in mind that nothing is so pure as not to contract
   some stain from us; just as water, which, although it may be drawn in
   purity from a limpid fountain, yet, if it passes over muddy ground, is
   tinged by it, and becomes somewhat turbid: thus nothing is so pure in
   itself as not to be polluted by the contagion of our flesh. Nothing is
   more excellent than the service of God; and yet the people could offer
   nothing, even although prescribed by the Law, except with the
   intervention of pardon, which none but the priest could obtain for
   them. There is now no sacrifice, nor was there ever, more pleasing to
   God than the invocation of His name, as He himself declares,

   "Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify me," (Psalm 50:15;)

   yet the Apostle teaches us that "the sacrifice of praise" only pleases
   God when it is offered in Christ. (Hebrews 13:15.) Let us learn, then,
   that our acts of obedience, when they come into God's sight, are
   mingled with iniquity, which exposes us to His judgment, unless Christ
   should sanctify them. In sum, this passage teaches us that whatsoever
   good works we strive to present to God are so far from deserving
   reward, that they rather convict us of guilt, unless the holiness of
   Christ, whereby God is propitiated, obtains pardon for them. And this
   is again asserted immediately afterwards, where Moses says that by
   favor of the priest the sins of the sacred oblations are taken away
   [168] "for favorable acceptation," i.e., that the Israelites may be
   sure that God is reconciled and favorable to them. I have nothing to
   say of the tiara itself, which some call a mitre, (cidarim,) and others
   a cap; neither do I choose to philosophize too subtilely about the belt
   or girdle. [169]

   40. And for Aaron's sons. The sons of Aaron also are separated not only
   from the body of the people, but likewise from the Levites; for a
   peculiar dignity was attached to that family, from whom his successor
   was afterwards to be taken. [170] And since no single individual was
   able to perform all their offices, they were distributed amongst them.
   Hence it was that they were adorned with the coat, the girdle, and the
   bonnet, "for glory and for beauty." We shall see as to their anointing
   in the next chapter. Their hands are said be filled, [171] when they
   are made fit for offering sacrifices, for as long as their hands are
   unconsecrated (profanae) they are accounted empty, even though they may
   be very full, since no gift is acceptable to God except in right of the
   priesthood; consequently their fullness arose from consecration,
   whereby it came that the oblations duly made had access to God. But we
   must observe that it is not their father Aaron, but Moses, who
   sanctifies them, that the power itself, or effect of their
   sanctification, may rest in God, and may not be transferred to His
   ministers. Perhaps, too, God would anticipate the calumnies of the
   ungodly, lest any should afterwards object that Aaron had fraudulently
   and unjustly extended the honor conferred upon himself alone to his
   sons also, and thus had unlawfully made it hereditary. He was protected
   against this reproach by the fact, that the sacerdotal dignity came to
   them from elsewhere. Besides, by these means the posterity of Moses was
   more certainly deprived of the hope they may have conceived in
   consideration of what their father was. Therefore Moses, by
   inaugurating the children of Aaron, reduced his own to their proper
   place, lest ally ambition should hereafter tempt them, or lest envy
   should possess them when they saw themselves put below others.

   42. And thou shalt make them linen breeches. Since men, in their
   natural levity and frowardness, lay hold of the very slightest causes
   of offense to the disparagement of holy things, and so religion easily
   sinks into contempt, God here, as a precaution against such a danger,
   delivers a precept respecting an apparently trivial matter, viz., that
   the priests should cover their nakedness with breeches. The sum is,
   that they should conduct themselves chastely and modestly, lest, if
   anything improper or indecorous should appear in them, the majesty of
   holy things should be impaired. Some, therefore, thus explain the
   clause, "that they may minister in holiness," [172] as if it were said,
   "that they may be pure from every stain, and may not desecrate God's
   service." In my opinion, however, the word qvds kodesh, should be taken
   for the sanctuary; and this is the more natural sense. A threat is
   added, that if they neglected this observance it would not be with
   impunity, since they would bring guilt upon themselves. Nor can we
   wonder at this, since all carelessness and negligence in the
   performance of sacred duties is closely connected with impiety and
   contempt of God. What immediately follows as to its being a perpetual
   law or statute, some, in my judgment improperly, restrict to the
   precept respecting the breeches, for it has a natural reference to the
   other ordinances of the priesthood. God therefore declares generally,
   that the Law which He gives is not for a little time, but that it may
   always remain in force as regards His elect people; whence we infer
   that the word vlm gnolam [173] whenever the legal types are in
   question, attains its end in the advent of Christ; and assuredly this
   is the true perpetuity of the ceremonies, that they should rest in
   Christ, who is their full truth and substance. For, since in Christ was
   at length manifested what was then delineated in shadows, these figures
   are established, because their use has ceased after the manifestation
   of their reality. And this we have already seen was long ago foretold
   by David, when he substitutes for the Levitical priesthood another
   "after the order of Melchisedec," (Psalm 110:4;) but the dignity being
   transferred, as the Apostle well reminds us, the Law and all the
   statutes must be of necessity transferred also. (Hebrews 7:12.) The
   ancient rites, therefore, are now at an end, because they do not accord
   with the spiritual priesthood of Christ; and herein the twofold
   sacrilege of the Papacy betrays itself, in that mortal men have dared
   to substitute another third priesthood for that of Christ, as if His
   were transitory; and also, in their foolish imitation of the Jews, have
   heaped together ceremonies which are directly opposed to the nature of
   Christ's priesthood. They reply, indeed, that His priesthood remains
   entire, although they have innumerable sacrifices; but they vainly
   endeavor to escape by this subterfuge, for if it was unlawful to
   change, or to innovate anything in the legal priesthood, how much less
   is it lawful to corrupt the priesthood of Christ by strange inventions,
   when its integrity has been ratified by the inviolable oath of God? The
   Father says to the Son, "Thou art a priest for ever;" how, then, does
   it avail to make the silly assertion that nothing is taken away from
   Christ, when an innumerable multitude (of priests) are appointed? How
   do these things accord, that He was anointed to offer Himself by the
   Spirit, and yet that He is offered by others? that by one offering He
   completed His work unto our full justification, and yet that He is
   offered daily? Now, if there be now-a-days no lawful priest except such
   an one as possesses in himself what was foreshewn in the ancient types,
   let them bring forth priests adorned with angelic purity, and as it
   were separate from the ranks of men, otherwise we shall be at liberty
   to repudiate all who are defiled by the very slightest stain. Hence,
   too, has arisen their second sacrilege, viz., that they have dared to
   obscure the brightness of the gospel with a new Judaism. They were
   altogether without the means of proving their priesthood, and so their
   easiest plan was to envelop their vanity in an immense mass of
   ceremonies, and, as it were, to shut out the light by clouds. So much
   the more diligently, then, must believers beware of departing from the
   pure institution of Christ, if they desire to have Him for their one
   and eternal Mediator.

   15. Arietem quoque alterum accipies, et imponent Aharon et filii ejus
   manus suas super caput arietis.

   16. And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and
   sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

   16. Tunc mactabis arietem, accipiesque sanguinem ejus, et asperges
   super altare per circuitum.

   17. And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him,
   and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

   17. Arietem autem concides ix, frusta sua, et lavabis intestina ejus,
   cruraque ejus, et pones super frusta ejus, et super caput ejus.

   18. And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt
   offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire
   unto the LORD.

   18. Incendes praeterea totum arietem super altare: nam holocaustum est
   Jehovae in odorem quietis: oblatio ignita Jehovae est.

   19. And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
   their hands upon the head of the ram.

   19. Accipies insuper arietem secundum, imponentque Aharon et filii ejus
   manus suas super caput arietis.

   20. Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it
   upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right
   ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the
   great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar
   round about.

   20. Tunc mactabis arietem, accipiesque de sanguine ejus, et pones super
   tenerum antis Aharon, et super tenerum auris filiorum ejus dextrae, et
   super pollisem manus eorum dextrae, et super pollicem pedis corum
   dextri, aspergesque sanguinem super altare per circuitum.

   21. And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the
   anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and
   upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall
   be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments
   with him.

   21. Tollesque de sanguine qui erit super altare, et de oleo unctionis:
   atque asperges super Aharon, et super vestes ejus, et super illlos
   ejus, et super vestes filiorum ejus cum eo.

   22. Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat
   that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
   kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it
   is a ram of consecration:

   22. Deinde tolles de ariete adipem, et caudam, et adipem operientem
   intestina, et reticulum jecoris, duosque renes, atque adipem qui est
   super eos, et armum dextrum: quia aries consecrationum est:

   23. And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer
   out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:

   23. Et tortam panis unam, et placentam panis ex oleo unam, et laganum
   unum e canistro infermentatorum qui est coram Jehova.

   24. And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of
   his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.

   24. Ponesque omnia ilia in manibus Aharon, et in manibus filiorum ejus,
   exaltabisque ilia exaltationem coram Jehova.

   25. And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the
   altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is
   an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

   25. Accipies autem illa e manu eorum, et incendes super altare, ultra
   holocaustum in odorem quietis coram Jehova: oblatio ignita est Jehovae.

   26. And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration,
   and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy
   part.

   26. Accipies item pectus arietis consecrationum quod est ipsi Aharon,
   et exaltabis illud exaltationem coram Jehova, eritque tibi in partem.

   27. And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
   shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up,
   of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of
   that which is for his sons:

   27. Sanctificabis itaque pectus exaltationis, et armum elevationis quod
   exaltatum est, et qui elevatus est de ariete consecrationum ipsius
   Aharon et filiorum ejus.

   28. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from
   the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an
   heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their
   peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

   28. Et erit ipsi Aharon et filiis ejus in statutum perpetuum a filiis
   Israel: quia exaltatio est: et exaltatio erit a filiis Israel de
   sacrificiis prosperitatum suarum, exaltatio inquam eorum erit Jehovae.

   29. And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be
   anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

   29. Porro vestes sanctae quae sunt ipsius Aharon, erunt filiis ejus
   post eum ad ungendum cos cure eis, et ad consecrandum cum els manum
   eorum.

   30. And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven
   days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to
   minister in the holy place.

   30. Septem diebus induct eas sacerdos qui fuerit loco ipsius de filiis
   ejus, qui ingredietur tabernaculum conventionis ad ministrandum in
   sanctuario.

   31. And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his
   flesh in the holy place.

   31. Arietem autem consecrationum tolles, et coques carnem ejus in loco
   sanctitatis.

   32. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
   bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation.

   32. Comedetque Aharon et filii ejus carnem arietis, et panem qui est in
   canistro, ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   33. And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made,
   to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat
   thereof, because they are holy.

   33. Comedent inquam illa quibus expiatus fuit ad consecrandum manum
   earum, ad sanctificandum cos: et alienigena non comedet, quia
   sanctificatio sunt.

   34. And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,
   remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:
   it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

   34. Quod si superfuerit de carne consecrationum, et de pane, usque
   mane, combures quod supcrest igni: non comedettur, quia sanctitas est.

   35. And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to
   all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou
   consecrate them.

   35. Facies igitur ipsi Aharon et filiis ejus sic, juxta omnia quae
   praecepi tibi: septem diebus consecrabis manum eorum.


   1. And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them. Since I shall
   again repeat and more fully explain these things as they are written in
   Leviticus 9, in the history of the consecration of the tabernacle, it
   will be sufficient to give nothing more than a brief summary of them
   here; nor is it my custom to invent mysteries out of vague
   speculations, [174] such as may rather gratify than instruct my
   readers. First, since the whole human race is corrupt and infected with
   many impurities, so that his uncleanness prevents every single
   individual from having access to God, Moses, before he consecrates the
   priests, washes them by the sprinkling of water, in order that they may
   be no longer deemed to be of ordinary rank. Hence we gather that true
   purity and innocence, which was but typical in the Law, is found in
   Christ alone. "For such an high priest became us," says the Apostle,
   "who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners," to present
   Himself before God for us. (Hebrews 7:26.) After they had been washed,
   God commands that they should be invested with the sacerdotal dress,
   according to their respective ranks: that the high priest should wear
   the ephod with the Urim and Thummim, and the mitre with the golden
   plate, on which shone forth "holiness to Jehovah;" and in the third
   place, He adds the anointing. This preparation was for the purpose of
   initiating them, before they performed the office of sacrificing; but
   it must be observed that, as to this first sacrifice, the duties which
   were afterwards transferred to Aaron were imposed upon Moses, as if he
   were the only priest; and, in point of fact, the temporal dignity which
   he afterwards resigned to his brother, was still in his own hands. What
   Moses introduces about the division of the victim, we shall more
   conveniently explain elsewhere, in treating of the offerings, which we
   have stated to be the third part of the legal worship.

   16. And thou shalt slay the ram. Moses had previously been commanded to
   take the parts of the victim from the hands of Aaron, to propitiate God
   with them, in order that he and his posterity might be able hereafter
   to perform the same office; but here a peculiar ceremony is described,
   that he should smear the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and
   the toe of the right foot, both of Aaron and his sons, with the blood
   of a ram; and then that he should sprinkle them and their garments with
   the blood which was deposited upon the altar. What we must first
   observe here is, that the priest must be sprinkled with blood, in order
   that he may conciliate the favor of God towards himself for the purpose
   of intercession. Thus the priesthood of Christ was dedicated with
   blood, so that it might be efficacious to reconcile God with us. The
   question now arises, why only the right ear and the right thumb and toe
   were sprinkled with blood, as if the priests were consecrated and
   devoted to God only in half of their persons? I reply, that in this one
   part the other was comprehended; since both the ears, and both the
   hands and feet have the same object, and their offices are so
   connected, that what is said of one ear applies to the other. Again, it
   is asked, why the ear, and foot, and hand, were smeared rather than the
   breast and the tongue? and I do not doubt but that by the ear obedience
   was designated, and by the hands and feet all the actions and the whole
   course of life; for there is scarcely anything more common in Scripture
   than these metonymies, by which the cleanness of the hands is taken for
   the integrity of the whole life, and the way, or course, or walk for
   the direction, or manner of living. It is therefore very appropriate
   that man's life should be consecrated by blood; and, inasmuch as the
   foundation of welldoing is obedience, which is preferred to all
   sacrifices, Moses is commanded to begin with the ear. And we know that
   the "odor of a sweet smell" in the sacrifice of Christ was obedience,
   (Philippians 4:18;) on which account, David, in the spirit of prophecy,
   introduces himself, saying, "Mine ears hast thou bored." [175] (Psalm
   40:6.) If any should object that the tongue is of no less importance,
   because the priest is the messenger of the Lord of hosts, I answer that
   the office of teaching is not here referred to, but only that of
   intercession; wherefore in these three members Moses embraced whatever
   related to atonement. But we must remember that what is said of the
   consecration of Christ does not apply to His own person, but refers to
   the profit of the whole Church; for neither was He anointed for His own
   sake, nor had He need to borrow [176] grace from the blood; but He had
   regard to His members, and devoted Himself altogether to their
   salvation, as He himself testifies, "For their sake I sanctify myself."
   (John 17:19.)

   28. And it shall be Aaron's. Lest the dignity of the sacred offerings,
   which are called the holiness of the Lord, should be impaired,
   strangers are prohibited from partaking of them; for, if it had been
   permitted that every one should touch them and eat of them, there would
   have been no distinction between them and ordinary food. Of the
   priests' portion some parts were common to all their families; but the
   holy parts were excepted, to the intent that by this particular
   instance the reverence due to all might be inculcated. The reference to
   place has the same object, for it was not lawful to eat what was holy
   within the walls of their houses, in order that it might be
   distinguished from their common and ordinary food. For the same reason,
   whatever remained of it was to be burnt, lest, if the flesh became
   rank, or the bread moldy, their ill savor and filthy appearance might
   somewhat detract from the dignity of the holy things; for the infirmity
   of the ancient people had need of childish rudiments, which might still
   have a tendency to elevate the minds of the pious to things above. This
   was the object of all these things, that no corruption should creep in
   which might pollute or render contemptible the service of God.

   Leviticus 8

   Leviticus 8:1-3

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est deinde Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
   anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a
   basket of unleavened bread;

   2. Tolle Aharon et filios ejus cure illo, et vestes, et oleum
   unctionis, et juvencum sacrificii pro peccato: et duos arietes, et
   canistrum azymorum.

   3. And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   3. Atque omnem coetum congrega ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.


   1. And the Lord spake. It is well known that in conjunction with the
   sacrifices there was an offering, which they call minha, but we shall
   elsewhere see that this was also used separately; for it was lawful
   without a victim to offer either plain meal, or cakes, or wafers
   seasoned with oil. Therefore, besides the sacrifice of consecration, of
   which Moses has already treated, this second offering is required from
   the priest, that he should present at his inauguration a cake fried in
   a pan, and cut in pieces. The reason of this appears to have been, that
   he might thence become the legitimate minister of all the people, and
   might duly offer in the name of others, when he had done what was right
   for himself. But a distinction is drawn between the demand upon the
   priest and that, upon the people, viz., that it should be "wholly
   burnt;" the reason for which, since it will be explained elsewhere, it
   will be now sufficient to advert to in a single word. The fact was that
   God was unwilling that the priests should indulge themselves in vain
   ostentation, which might have been easily the case, if the oblation had
   been preserved for their use, like the minha of the people which
   remained in their hands.

   Numbers 8

   Numbers 8:5-19, 23-26

   5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   5. Loquutusque est praeterea Jehova ipsi Mosi, dicendo:

   6. Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse
   them.

   6. Cape Levitas e medio filiorum Israel, et purifices illos.

   7. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of
   purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them
   wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.

   7. Sic autem facies illis ut purifices illos: sparge super eos aquam
   purificationis, et transire faciant novaculam super totam carnem suam,
   laventque vestimenta sua, et purificentur.

   8. Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even.
   fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take
   for a sin offering.

   8. Postea capient juvencum filium bovis, et minham ejus similam
   conspersam oleo: et juvencum alterura filium bovis capies in
   sacrificium pro peccato.

   9. And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
   congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
   of Israel together.

   9. Tunc offeres Levitas coram tabernaculo conventionis: et congregabis
   omnem coetum filiorum Israel.

   10. And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children
   of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

   10. Offeres inquam Levitas eoram Jehova, et conjungent filii Israel
   marius suas super Levitas.

   11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering
   of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the
   LORD.

   11. Offeretque Aharon Levitas in oblationem coram Jehova a filiis
   Israel, et ministrabunt in ministerio Jehovae.

   12. And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
   bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the
   other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the
   Levites.

   12. Levitae autem conjungent manus suas super caput juvencorum: postea
   facies unum pro peccato, et alterum in holocaustum Jehovae ad expiandum
   Levitas.

   13. And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
   and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

   13. Statuesque Levitas coram Aharon et coram fillis ejus, et offeres
   illos oblationem Jehovae.

   14. Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
   Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

   14. Ac segregabis Levitas e medio filiorum Israel: erunt mei Levitae.

   15. And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
   tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer
   them for an offering.

   15. Posted autem venient Levitae ad ministrandum in tabernaculo
   conventionis, et expiabis illos, offeresque cos oblationem.

   16. For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
   Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the
   firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

   16. Quid dati, dati inquam sunt mihi e medio filiorum Israel pro
   aperiente omnem vulvam, pro primogenito filiorum Israel accepi cos
   mihi.

   17. For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man
   and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt
   I sanctified them for myself.

   17. Meus est enim omnis primogenitus in filiis Israel tam hominum quam
   jumentorum: a die quo percussi omne primogenitum in terra AEgypti,
   sanctificavi illa mihi.

   18. And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children
   of Israel.

   18. Cepi autem Levitas pro onmi primogenito in filiis Israel.

   19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
   from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of
   Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement
   for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children
   of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

   19. Et dedi Levitas dono datos Aharoni et filiis eius e medio filiorum
   Israeli, ut fungantur officio filiorum Israel in tabernaculo
   conventionis, et expient filios Israel: neque sit in filiis Israel
   plaga, quum ipsi appropinquaverint sanctuario.

   23. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   23. Loquutns est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   24. This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five
   years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the
   tabernacle of the congregation:

   24. Hoc quoque est quod ad Levitas pertinet, vicesimo quinto anno et
   supra ingredientur militare militiara in cultu tabernaculi
   conventionis.

   25. And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the
   service thereof, and shall serve no more:

   25. A quinquagesimo autem anno revertetur a militia cultus, nec
   ministrabit ultra:

   26. But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt
   thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

   26. Sed ministrabit cum fratribus suis in tabernaculo conventionis, ut
   munere suo illi fungantur et ministerium non administrabit: sic facies
   de Levitis in custodiis eorum.


   5. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Although the Levites were not allowed
   to go into the sanctuary, but were only the priests' ministers, and
   chiefly employed in servile duties, yet, inasmuch as they carried the
   tabernacle and the sacred vessels, prepared the sacrifices, took away
   the ashes and other offscourings from the altar, God would have them
   consecrated to Himself by a solemn rite. For as all Israel, with
   respect to the Gentiles, was God's peculiar people, so the house of
   Levi was chosen out of the people itself to be His own property, as it
   is here said. But, lest they should arrogate to themselves more than
   was right, God anticipates their presumption: first, by putting off
   their consecration for some time; secondly, by desiring that they
   should not be initiated by Moses, but by Aaron; and thirdly, by
   appointing a different ceremony for it. For, if they had been initiated
   at the same time as the priests, under this pretext they might have
   contended to be on an equality with them; therefore, although the
   priests were already separated from the common people, yet the Levites
   still remain unconsecrated, (privati,) in order that they may learn to
   reverence the priestly office. And again, since, if they had been
   dedicated likewise by Moses, there was a danger of their being puffed
   up with pride against all others, Aaron is appointed to preside over
   their consecration, that they may modestly submit themselves to his
   authority. Since, too, they were only purified by water, and sacrifice,
   and without the addition of anointing, the difference in the external
   rite reminded them that their degree of honor was not similar or the
   same.

   6. Take the Levites from among. To take them from among the children of
   Israel, is equivalent to subtracting them from the number of the
   people, that they might not be included in the general census, and
   accounted to be one of the tribes. This separation, then, as he will
   more clearly express a little further on, devoted the Levites to God
   for the service of the sanctuary. That under this pretext the Papal
   clergy should claim immunity for themselves, so that they may live as
   they like in exemption from the laws, is not only an unsound deduction,
   but one full of impious mockery; for, since the ancient priesthood
   attained its end in Christ, the succession, which they allege, robs
   Christ of His right, as if the full truth had not been manifested in
   Him. Besides, inasmuch as all their privileges only depend on the
   primacy of the Pope, if they would have them ratified they must needs
   prove, first of all, that the Pope is appointed by God's command to be
   the head of the whole Church, and therefore that he is the successor of
   Christ. As to Aaron, since he was the minister of their installation,
   in this way he was set over the Levites to rule them at his discretion.
   Meanwhile this ministry is thus entrusted to a man, in such a manner as
   not to stand in the way of God's gratuitous good pleasure.

   7. And thus shalt thou do unto them. Aaron is commanded first to
   sprinkle the water of purifying upon them, to cleanse them from their
   uncleanness; and not only so, but they are commanded to wash their
   clothes, that they may diligently beware of any impurity being anywhere
   about them, whereby their persons may be infected. Thirdly, they are
   commanded to shave their skin with a razor, that, putting off their
   flesh, they may begin to be new men. A sacrifice is afterwards added,
   and that twofold, to make an atonement for them. These things being
   completed, Aaron, in right and to the honor of the priesthood, is
   commanded to offer them just like the holy bread or incense. But the
   end of this was, that they might acknowledge that they were no longer
   their own masters, but devoted to God, that they might engage
   themselves in the service of the sanctuary. It was in testimony of
   alienation that some of the people were ordered at the same time to lay
   their hands upon them; as if by this ceremony all the tribes bore
   witness that with their consent the Levites passed over to be God's
   peculiar property, that they might be a part or appendage of the
   sanctuary. For private individuals (as we shall see hereafter) were
   accustomed to lay their hands on their sacrifices, yet not with the
   same object as the priests. [177]

   16. For they are wholly given. Lest the other tribes should complain
   that the number of the people was diminished, God declares that the
   Levites were alienated from the race of Abraham, since He had acquired
   them to Himself when He smote all the first-born of Egypt; for it is
   certain that the first-born of the people, as well as those of their
   animals, were miraculously rescued from the common destruction. Since,
   then, God delivered them by special privilege, He thus bound them to
   Himself by the blessing of their redemption. But this reason would seem
   no longer to hold good, when God, in demanding the price of redemption,
   set the first-born free, [178] as was elsewhere stated; else He would
   require the same thing twice over, which would be unjust. The solution,
   however, of this is easy; when, in the first census, the first-born of
   the twelve tribes were counted, they were found to exceed the Levites
   in number. An exchange was then made, viz., that all the first-born of
   the twelve tribes, being 22,000 in number, should be free from the
   tribute, and that God should take the Levites in their place as His
   ministers. Only 273 were redeemed, because this was the excess of their
   number above that of the Levites. Thus was it brought to pass, that God
   was content with these just and equal terms, so as not to oppress the
   people by a heavy burden. But this compensation, which was only made on
   that one particular day, did not prevent the Israelites from owing
   their children, who were not then born, to God. Since, then, this
   obligation still lay upon them as regarded their posterity, the law was
   passed that they should redeem their first-born. If any should object
   that it was not fair for those who should be born of the Levites to be
   consecrated to God, -- I reply, that on this point there was no
   unfairness, for of whatever tribe they might be descended, they were
   already His property, together with all their offspring; the condition
   of the people was not therefore made worse by the exchange; and hence,
   in all equity, God appointed for the future at what price the
   Israelites should redeem their first-born. In saying that they were
   "given" to Him, He means to assert that they were His by compact; [179]
   and in this sense He declares that from the day in which He smote the
   first-born of Egypt, the first-born of Israel had become His; and then
   adds, that He then took the Levites; as much as to say, that He only
   dealt with his people with respect to the time past.

   19. And I have given the Levites. He declares on what terms He desires
   to have them as His own, viz., that they may be directed by Aaron, and
   obey his commands; for by "a gift" is not to be understood such an act
   as that whereby a person resigns and cedes his own right to another;
   but, when He devotes them to the ministry of the sanctuary, He desires
   that they should have a leader and master. At the end of the verse,
   Moses teaches that this is done for the advantage and profit of the
   whole people: whence it follows, that there was no room for ill-will
   towards them, unless the people should perhaps be annoyed that God had
   taken measures for their welfare. A two-fold advantage is pointed out;
   first, because they were to be the intercessors or ministers of
   reconciliation, (for either sense would be appropriate;) secondly,
   because, whilst they would be the guardians of the sanctuary, they
   would prevent the Israelites from bringing destruction upon themselves,
   by their rash approach to it.

   24. This is it, that belongeth to the Levites. The age is here
   prescribed when the Levites should begin and end the execution of their
   office. God commands them to commence in their 25th year and grants
   them their dismissal in their 50th; and for both these provisions there
   is very good reason. For, if they had been admitted in early youth,
   their levity might have greatly detracted from the reverence due to
   sacred things: not only because those, whose manhood is not yet mature,
   are generally given to pleasure and intemperance, but because either by
   negligence, or levity, or want of thought, or ignorance and error, they
   might have made many grievous mistakes in the service of God; and,
   whilst they were by no means fitted to exercise their charge until they
   should have attained prudence and gravity, so also, lest they should
   fail from old age, it was right that they should be seasonably
   dismissed; for as we have before said, their duties were laborious, and
   such as demanded bodily strength. If, however, any should choose to
   make an application of this to the pastoral office, it should be
   generally remembered, that none should be chosen to it except such as
   have already given proofs of their moderation, and float those who
   diligently devote themselves to it should not be unreasonably pressed
   upon, nor should more be required of them than their ability can bear;
   for some foolishly count their years, as if it were a sin to choose a
   pastor before his 24th year, although he might be otherwise fully
   provided with the necessary qualifications.

   Numbers 3

   Numbers 3:5-10

   5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   5. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the
   priest, that they may minister unto him.

   6. Appropinquare fac tribum Levi, et siste eam coram Aharone sacerdote,
   ut ministret ei.

   7. And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
   congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the
   service of the tabernacle.

   7. Et custodiant custodiam ejus, et custodiam universi coatus coram
   tabernaculo conventionis, ut exequantur cultum tabernaculi.

   8. And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the
   service of the tabernacle.

   8. Custodiant quoque omnia utensilia tabernaculi conventionis,
   custodiamque filiorum Israel, ut exequantur culture tabernaculi.

   9. And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are
   wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

   9. Da inquam Levitas ipsi Aharon, et filiis ejus: dati, dati namque
   sunt illi ex filiis Israel.

   10. And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on
   their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put
   to death.

   10. Aharon autem et filios ejus praeficies, custodientque sacerdotium
   suum: externus sane qui accesserit morietur.


   5. And the Lord spake unto Moses. This passage contains two heads:
   first, That the Levites should be set apart for the ministry of the
   sanctuary and altar; and, secondly, That they should obey the chief
   priests of the family of Aaron, and do nothing except by their
   authority and command. But it has been already said, and we shall
   hereafter see again, that the tribe of Levi in general was divinely
   chosen to perform the sacred offices; so that the people might know
   that no one was worthy of so honorable a charge; but that it depended
   on the gratuitous calling of God, whose attribute it is to create all
   things out of nothing. In this way, not only was the temerity of those
   repressed who might be foolishly ambitious of the honor, but the whole
   Church was taught that, in order to worship God aright, there was need
   of extraneous aid. For, if the Levites had not stood between, the Law
   prohibited the rest of the people from having access to God, since it
   brought in the whole human race guilty of pollution. But, in order that
   they might be more certainly directed to the One Mediator, the high
   priesthood was exalted, and one priest was chosen to preside over all
   the rest: on this account God would have the Levites subject to the
   successors of Aaron. At the same time, He had regard to order, for a
   multitude, which is not governed by chiefs, will always be disorderly.
   Yet, it is unquestionable that the supreme power of Christ was
   represented in the person of Aaron; and hence the folly of the Papists
   is refuted, who transfer, or rather wrest, this example to the state of
   the Christian Church, [180] so as to set the bishops over the
   presbyters, and thus to fabricate the primacy of the Roman See. But if
   the true meaning of this figure be sought, it will be more appropriate
   to reason that, whatever ministers and pastors of the Church are now
   appointed, they are placed as it were under the hand of Christ, in
   order that they may usurp no dominion, but behave themselves modestly,
   as having to render an account to Him who is the Prince of pastors. (1
   Peter 5:4.) Hence we conclude that the Papacy is only founded in wicked
   sacrilege; for Christ is unjustly deprived of His own, if any one else
   is feigned to be Aaron's successor. Meanwhile, the political
   distinction of ranks is not to be repudiated, for natural reason itself
   dictates this in order to take away confusion; but that which shall
   have this object in view, will be so arranged that it may neither
   obscure Christ's glory nor minister to ambition or tyranny, nor prevent
   all ministers from cultivating mutual fraternity with each other, with
   equal rights and liberties. Hence, too, was taken that declaration of
   the Apostle, that it is not lawful for any man to take this honor upon
   himself, but that they are the legitimate ministers of the Church who
   are "called" to be so. (Hebrews 5:4)

   Exodus 30

   Exodus 30:22-33

   22. Moreover, the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   22. Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   23. Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
   hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred
   and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,

   23. Tu sume tibi aromata optima: myrrhae fluidae ad quingentos siclos,
   cinnamomi aromatici dimidium ipsius, ducentos et quinquaginta: et
   calami atomatici ducentos et quinquaginta:

   24. And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
   sanctuary, and of oil-olive an hin:

   24. Casiae vero quingentos siclos, pondere sanctuarii: et olei olivae
   hin:

   25. And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
   compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing
   oil.

   25. Et facies ex ea oleum unctionis sanctitatis, unguentum unguenti,
   opus unguentarii; oleum unctionis sanctitatis erit.

   26. And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith,
   and the ark of the testimony,

   26. Unges eo tabernaculum conventionis, et arcam testimonii,

   27. And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
   vessels, and the altar of incense,

   27. Et mensam onmiaque vasa ipsius, et candelabrum omniaque vasa
   ipsius, et altare suffimenti:

   28. And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver
   and his foot.

   28. Altare quoque holocausti et omnia vasa ipsius, et concham et basin
   ejus.

   29. And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
   whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

   29. Ita sanctificabis ea, erunt sanctitas sanctitatum: quicquid
   tetigerit ea, sanctificabitur.

   30. And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that
   they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   30. Aharon praeterea et filios ejus unges, et sanctificabis eos, ut
   sacerdotio fungantur mihi.

   31. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
   shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

   31. Ad filios autem Israel loqueris, dicendo, Oleum unctionis
   sanctitatis erit hoc mihi per generationes vestras.

   32. Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured; neither shall ye make any
   other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be
   holy unto you.

   32. Super carnem hominis non ungent: neque compositioni ejus facietis
   similes: sanctum est, sanctum erit vobis.

   33. Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it
   upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

   33. Quisquis confecerit unguentum simile, et qui posuerit ex eo super
   extraneum, succidetur e populis suis.


   23. Take thou also unto thee principal spices. Although the oil here
   treated of was not only destined for the anointing of the priests, but
   also of the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, and all
   the vessels, yet no fitter place occurs for discussing the sacred
   unction, than by connecting it with the priesthood, on which it
   depends. First of all its composition is described, exquisite both in
   expensiveness and odor; that by its very excellence and costliness the
   Israelites may learn that no ordinary thing is represented by it; for
   we have already often seen that there had been set before this rude
   people a splendor in sacred symbols, which might affect their external
   senses, so as to uplift them as it were by steps to the knowledge of
   spiritual things. We must now see why the priest as well as all the
   vessels and the other parts of the tabernacle had need of anointing. I
   conclude that without controversy this oil mixed with precious perfumes
   was a type of the Holy Spirit; for the metaphor of anointing is
   everywhere met with, when the prophets would commend the power, the
   effects, and the gifts of the Spirit. Nor is there any doubt but that
   God, by anointing kings, testified that He would endow them with the
   spirit of prudence, fortitude, clemency, and justice. Hence it is
   easily gathered that the tabernacle was sprinkled with oil, that the
   Israelites might learn that all the exercises of piety profited nothing
   without the secret operation of the Spirit. Nay, something more was
   shewn forth, viz., that the efficacy and grace of the Spirit existed
   and reigned in the truth of the shadows itself; and that whatever good
   was derived from them was applied by the gift of the same Spirit for
   the use of believers. In the altar, reconciliation was to be sought,
   that God might be propitious to them; but, as the Apostle testifies,
   the sacrifice of Christ's death would not otherwise have been
   efficacious to appease God, if He had not suffered by the Spirit,
   (Hebrews 9:14;) and how does its fruit now reach us, except because the
   same Spirit washes our souls with the blood, which once was shed, as
   Peter teaches us? (1 Peter 1:2.) Who now consecrates our prayers but
   the Spirit, who dictates the groans which cannot be uttered; and by
   whom we cry, Abba, Father? (Romans 8:15, 26.) Nay, whence comes the
   faith which admits us to a participation in the benefits of Christ, but
   from the same Spirit?

   But we were especially to consider the anointing of the priest, who was
   sanctified by the Spirit of God for the performance of his office;
   thus, as Isaiah, in the person of Jesus Christ, declares that he was
   anointed with the spirit of prophecy, (Isaiah 61:1;) and David affirms
   the same of the royal spirit, (Psalm 45:7;) so Daniel is our best
   interpreter and witness how the sacerdotal unction was at length
   manifested (in Him [181] ), for when he says that the time, when by the
   death of Christ the prophecy shall be sealed up, was determined upon
   "to anoint the holy of holies," he plainly reminds us that the
   spiritual pattern, which answers to the visible sanctuary, is in
   Christ; so that believers may really feel that these shadows were not
   mere empty things. (Daniel 9:24.) We now perceive why Aaron was
   anointed, viz., because Christ was consecrated by the Holy Spirit to be
   the Mediator between God and man; and why the tabernacle and its
   vessels were sprinkled with the same oil, viz., because we are only
   made partakers of the holiness of Christ by the gift and operation of
   the Spirit. [182] Some translate it in the masculine gender, where of
   the vessels it is said, "whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy;" ver.
   29: as if they were not to be touched by any but the priests; but it
   appears to me to be rather spoken for another reason, viz., that they
   may embue the oblations with their own sanctity.

   25. And thou shalt take it an oil of holy ointment. Although the
   genitive is put in the place of an epithet, as if Moses had said "a
   holy oil;" yet it is so called from its effect, because without it
   nothing is accounted pure. And assuredly the Spirit of God sanctifies
   ourselves and all that is ours, because without Him we are unholy, and
   all that belongs to us corrupt. He enjoins the use of the ceremony
   throughout all the generations of the ancient people, ver. 31. In these
   words there is an implied contrast with the new Church, which wants no
   shadows since the manifestation of the substance; and justly does the
   only begotten Son of God possess the name of Christ, since by His
   coming He has abolished these figures. And Simeon, when he took Him in
   his arms, and called Him "the Lord's Christ," [183] taught that the
   external use of the legal oil had ceased. So much the sillier is the
   superstition of the Papacy, when in imitation of the Jews it anoints
   its priests, and altars, and other toys: [184] as if they desired to
   bury Christ again with their ointments; wherefore let us hold this
   invention in detestation as blasphemous, because it overthrows the
   limits prescribed by God.

   In order that the Jews may hold this mystery in just reverence, he
   forbids similar ointment to be made. We know that ointments were then
   among the luxuries of a fine banquet; but it is accounted profanation
   if they make use of this kind; and we must mark the reason, that what
   is holy, may be holy unto them, ver. 32, i.e., that they may reverently
   observe what is peculiarly devoted to their salvation. For although the
   sacred things divinely instituted always retain their nature, and
   cannot be either corrupted or made void by our vices, yet may we by our
   filthiness, by our impure use or neglect of them, pollute them as far
   as in us lies.

   Leviticus 8

   Leviticus 8:1-3

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est deinde Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
   anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a
   basket of unleavened bread;

   2. Tolle Aharon et filios ejus cure illo, et vestes, et oleum
   unctionis, et juvencum sacrificii pro peccato: et duos arietes, et
   canistrum azymorum.

   3. And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   3. Atque omnem coetum congrega ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.


   2. Take Aaron. He more clearly explains the mode of anointing and
   investing the priests, by appointing the place and the assistants; for
   he commands the congregation to be convoked at the sanctuary; and then
   that Aaron and his sons should be brought out before them to be
   inaugurated by God's authority in their office; and that the whole
   people together may acknowledge that they are appointed and ordained by
   God. The execution of the command, which we find connected with it in
   the text of Moses, must be undoubtedly referred to another time; viz.,
   when the solemn dedication of the tabernacle was made. I have therefore
   thought fit to transfer thither what is here related out of its place,
   that the history may proceed uninterruptedly; which will not a little
   facilitate its comprehension.

   Leviticus 21

   Leviticus 21:1-6, 10-12

   1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of
   Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead
   among his people:

   1. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Alloquere sacerdotes filios Aharon, et
   dicito eis, Super animam non contaminabit se quisquam vestrum it,
   populis suis:

   2. But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and
   for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his
   brother,

   2. Sed super propinquo suo, propinquo sibi, nempe super matre sua, et
   super patre suo, et super filio suo, et super filia sua, et superfratre
   suo.,

   3. And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had
   no husband; for her may he be defiled.

   3. Et super sorore sua virgine propinqua sibi, quae non fuerit viro:
   super ea contaminabit se.

   4. But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,
   to profane himself.

   4. Non contaminabit se in principe in populis suis, ut polluat sese.

   5. They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
   shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their
   flesh.

   5. Non decalvabunt calvitium in capitc suo, et extremitatem barbae suse
   non radent, et in carne sua non incident ullam incisuram.

   6. They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their
   God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their
   God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

   6. Sancti erunt Dco suo, neque polluent nomen Dei sui: quia oblationes
   ignitas Jehovoe, et panem Dei tui offerunt, proinde erunt sancti.

   10. And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head
   the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the
   garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

   10. Sacerdos autem praecipuus inter fratres suos super cujus caput
   fusum fuerit oleum unctionis, et consecraverit manum suam ut induat
   vestes, caput suum non discooperiet, et vestes suas non scindet.

   11. Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
   father, or for his mother;

   11. Et ad omnes animas mortui non ingredietur, ne super patre quidem
   suo, ant matre sua, contaminabit se.

   12. Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary
   of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him:
   I am the LORD.

   12. Et de sanctuario non ingredietur, neque polluet sanctuarium Dei
   sui: quia corona olei unctionis Dei sui est super eum. Ego Jehova.


   1. Speak unto the priests. All these things which follow tend to the
   same end, i.e., that the priests may differ from the rest of the people
   by notable marks, as if separated from ordinary men; for special purity
   became those who represented the person of Christ. It seems, indeed, as
   if God here gave precepts respecting small and unimportant things; but
   we have elsewhere said that the legal rites were as it were steps by
   which the Israelites might ascend to the study of true holiness. The
   declaration of Paul indeed was always true, that "bodily exercise
   profiteth little," (1 Timothy 4:8;) but the use of the ancient shadows
   under the Law must be estimated by their end. Although, therefore, the
   observation of the things which are now treated of did not of itself
   greatly please God, yet inasmuch as it had a higher tendency, it was
   sinful to make light of it. Now though the priests were thus admonished
   that holiness was to be cultivated by them with peculiar diligence, as
   the sanctity of their office required; yet the principal design of God
   was to set forth the image of perfect holiness which was at length
   beheld in Christ. The first law contains a prohibition of mourning,
   absolutely and without exception as regarded the high priest, and as
   regarded the sons of Aaron with certain specified restrictions; for
   although God elsewhere forbids the people generally to imitate the
   custom of the Gentiles in excessive mourning, yet here he requires
   something more of the priests, viz., that they should abstain even from
   ordinary mourning, such as was permitted to others. This prohibition
   indeed was again repeated, as we shall see, arising from an actual
   occurrence; for when Nadab and Abihu, who had offered incense with
   strange fire, were consumed with fire from heaven, God allowed them to
   be mourned for by all the people, except the priests; [185] but on this
   occasion the general law was again ratified afresh, lest the priests
   should pollute themselves by mourning for the dead; except that there
   mourning was forbidden even for a domestic loss, that they might
   acquiesce in God's judgment, however sad it might be. For by these
   means they were impeded in the discharge of their duties; because it
   was not lawful for mourners to enter the sanctuary. Therefore God
   threatens them with death, unless they should restrain their grief even
   for the death of a near relative But this (as is elsewhere said) is a
   rare virtue, so to repress our feelings when we are deprived of our
   brothers or friends, as that the bitterness of our grief should not
   overcome our resignation and composure of mind. In this way, therefore,
   the exemplary piety of the priests was put to the proof. Besides,
   abstinence from mourning manifests the hope of the blessed
   resurrection. Therefore the priests were forbidden to mourn for the
   dead, in order that the rest of the people might seek for consolation
   in their sorrow from them. [186] This was truly and amply fulfilled in
   Christ, who although He bore not only grief, but the extreme horror of
   death, yet was free from every stain, and gloriously triumphed over
   death; so that the very recollection of His cross wipes away our tears,
   and fills us with joy. Now when it is said, "They shall not profane the
   name of their God;" and in the case of the high priest, "neither shall
   he go out of the sanctuary;" this reason confirms what; I have just
   stated, that mourning was forbidden them, because it prevented them
   from the discharge of their duties; for their very squalidness would
   have in some sense defiled God's sanctuary, in which nothing unseemly
   was to be seen; and being defiled too, they could not intercede as
   suppliants for the people. God then commands them to remain pure and
   clear from all defilement, lest they should be compelled to desert
   their office, and to leave the sanctuary, of which they were the
   keepers. Moreover, we learn that the fulfillment of this figure was in
   Christ, from the reason which is immediately added: viz., because the
   holy oil is on the head of the high priest; whereby God intimates that
   it is by no means right that His glory and dignity should be profaned
   by any pollution.

   As to the words themselves; first, greater liberty is granted to the
   rest of the posterity of Aaron, than to the high priest; but only that
   they should mourn for their father, mother, children, their own
   brothers, and unmarried sisters. Lest ambition should carry them
   further, they are expressly forbidden to put on mourning even upon the
   death of a prince. Nor can we doubt but that the mourning was improper
   which God permitted to them out of indulgence; but regard was had to
   their weakness, lest immoderate strictness might drive them to
   passionate excess; yet God so spared them as still to distinguish them
   from the multitude. To "defile" one's-self, (as we have elsewhere
   seen,) is equivalent to putting on mourning for the dead, celebrating
   the funeral rites, or going to the burial; because the curse of God
   proclaims itself in the death of man, so that a corpse infects with
   contagion those by whom it is touched; and again, because it must needs
   be that where lamentation is indulged, and as it were excited, the
   affection itself must burst out into impatience. As to the prohibition
   to make "baldness," this was not allowed even to the rest of the
   people; but God expressly forbids it to the priests, in order to keep
   them under stricter restraint. With regard to the high priest,
   something greater seems to be decreed besides the exceptions, that he
   "shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes:" which is still
   enjoined elsewhere on the sons of Aaron. But here what would be
   allowable in others is condemned in the high priest; and it was surely
   reasonable that he should present a peculiar example of moderation and
   gravity; and therefore the dignity of his office, in which he was
   superior to others, is called to mind, that he may acknowledge his
   obligations to be so much the greater. This is indeed the sum, that
   since the priesthood is the holiness of God, it must not be mixed up
   with any defilements.

   Deuteronomy 31

   Deuteronomy 31:9

   9. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons
   of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all
   the elders of Israel.

   9. Scripsitque Moses Legem istam, et dedit eam sacerdotibus filiis Levi
   portantibus arcata foederis jehovae, et cunctis senioribus Israel.


   9. And Moses wrote this law. It is unquestionable that Moses deposited
   the Book of the Law in the custody of the Levites, to enjoin upon them
   the duty of teaching; for although it is only related that they were
   commanded to recite the book before the people every seventh year, yet
   it is easy to gather that they were appointed the constant proclaimers
   of its doctrine. For it would have been absurd that the Law should lie
   buried for seven whole years, and that not a word should be heard of
   its instruction; besides, the difficulty of hearing in so great a
   multitude would be great, and the recollection of it would soon have
   vanished. In a word, very little would have been the use of the
   ceremony, if at all other times the Levites had been dumb, and nothing
   should have been heard throughout the land regarding the worship of
   God. This then was the object of the solemn promulgation of the Law,
   (Deuteronomy 31:10, etc.), which was made in the year of release, that
   the people should daily inquire the right way of serving God of the
   Levites, who were chosen to be as it were nomophulakes (guardians of
   the Law), that they might bring forward in due season whatever it was
   profitable to know. Here, then, is represented to us as in a mirror
   what Paul says, that the Church of God is "the pillar and ground of the
   truth," (1 Timothy 3:15;) because purity of doctrine is preserved
   unimpaired in the world, and propagated by the ministry of pastors,
   whilst piety would soon decay if the living preaching of doctrine
   should cease. Therefore Paul also elsewhere commands that the sound
   doctrine, of which he was a minister, should be committed by Timothy

   "to faithful men, who should be able to teach others also."
   (2 Timothy 2:2.)

   First, then, we must remember, that the Book of the Law was given in
   trust, as it were, to the Levites, that the people might learn from
   them what was right. The addition of "the elders" is not superfluous;
   for although the office of teaching was not committed to them, yet were
   they given as coadjutors to the Levites, in order that they might
   uphold the doctrine of the Law, and not suffer it to be scorned. We
   know how great is the insolence of the people in rejecting pious
   teachers, unless they are restrained by those in authority; nor do the
   latter indeed duly fulfill their duty, if they do not keep their
   subjects to the study of religion, who would be otherwise too much
   disposed to impiety.

   Moses in this passage calls by the name of "the Law," not the Ten
   Commandments engraved on the two tables, but the interpretation of it
   contained in the four books. The circumstances took place thirty-nine
   years after God had spoken on Mount Sinai. What follows, that it was to
   be read every seven years, I have commented on elsewhere; [187] but
   there will be no harm in repeating what may serve for the understanding
   of this passage. The seventh year was chosen for this purpose, because
   all, both males and females, might then assemble at Jerusalem without
   detriment to their private interests, for there was a cessation from
   all labor; they neither sowed, nor reaped, and agriculture was
   altogether at a stand-still. There was therefore no business to prevent
   them from celebrating that festival, whereby God represented to them in
   a lively manner, how miraculously He had preserved their fathers in the
   desert. Lest the recollection of so great a benefit should ever perish,
   the Law indeed commanded them, wherever they might be, to go forth from
   their houses every year, and to pass seven days under the boughs of
   trees; but in the Sabbatical Year, when all was at rest at home, it was
   more convenient for them to go up to Jerusalem from all quarters, that
   by their very multitude they might the better testify their gratitude.
   Therefore it is added, "when all Israel is come," etc. And it must be
   observed, that in that assembly they were more solemnly pledged, one
   and all, to keep the Law, because they were mutually witnesses against
   each other if they should break the covenant thus publicly renewed. On
   this account it is added, "Gather the people together, men, women, and
   children." But that it might not be a mere empty spectacle, it is
   expressly commanded that the book should be read "in their hearing:" by
   which words a recitation is expressed, from whence the hearers might
   receive profit, else it would have been a sham and ludicrous parade;
   just as in the Papacy, when they loudly bellow out the Scriptures in an
   unknown tongue, they do but profane God's name. To this end, therefore,
   did God desire the doctrine of His Law to be heard; viz., that He might
   obtain disciples for Himself; not that He might fill their ears with a
   senseless and unprofitable clamour. And indeed when the Popish priests
   were a little ashamed of altogether driving the people away from
   hearing God's word, they devised this foolish plan of shouting to the
   deaf, as if this silly formality would satisfy God's command, when He
   ordains that all should be taught from the least to the greatest: for
   it is afterwards again expressed, "that they may hear, and that they
   may learn." Hence we lay it down, that the legitimate use of Scripture
   is perverted when it is enunciated in an obscure manner such as no one
   can understand. But whilst no other mode of reading Scripture is
   approved by God, except such as may instruct the people, so also the
   fruit of understanding, i.e., that they may learn to fear God, is
   required in the hearers. But it is undoubted, that "the fear of God"
   comprehends faith, nay, that properly speaking it springs from faith;
   and by this expression Moses indicates that the Law was given for the
   purpose of instructing men in piety and the pure service of God. At the
   same time we may learn from this passage, that all the services which
   are paid to God in ignorance, are extravagant, and illegitimate. The
   beginning of wisdom is to fear God; and on this point all agree; but
   then each one slips away to his own imaginations and erroneous
   devotions, as they choose to call them. God, however, in order to
   restrain such audacity as this, declares that he is not duly
   worshipped, except He shall first have been listened to. As to "the
   strangers," when their participation in sacred things is in question, I
   have elsewhere observed that all foreigners are not so called, but only
   those who, being Gentiles by origin, had devoted themselves to God, and
   having received circumcision, had been incorporated into the Church;
   otherwise it would not have been lawful to admit them into the
   congregation of the faithful; and this is confirmed by the additional
   words, "that is within thy gates:" which is as much as if Moses had
   said, inhabitants of your cities, and dwelling together with the
   people. Finally, when their children are mentioned, reference is made
   to the propagation of sound doctrine, that the pure worship of God may
   continually be maintained. He therefore commands that the Law should be
   recited, not in one generation only, but as long as the status of the
   people may last; and surely all God's servants ought to take care, that
   they may transmit to posterity what they have learnt themselves. Yet we
   must remark, that all doctrine which may have been handed down from
   their ancestors, is not here promiscuously commended; but God rather
   claims for Himself the entire authority, both towards the fathers and
   the children.

   Leviticus 10

   Leviticus 10:8-11

   8. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

   8. Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad Aharon, dicendo:

   9. Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee,
   when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it
   shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:

   9. Vinum et siceram non bibes tu et filii tui tecum, quando intrabitis
   in tabernaculum conventionis, ne moriamini: statutum perpetuum est in
   generationibus vestris:

   10. And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between
   unclean and clean;

   10. Et ut discernatis inter sanctum et profanum, et inter immundum et
   mundum.

   11. And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which
   the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

   11. Et ut doceatis filios Israel omnis statuta qum loquutus est Jehova
   ad eos per manum Mosis.


   9. Do not drink wine, nor strong drink. The second cleanness required
   in the priests is that they should abstain from wine, and strong drink;
   [188] in which word Jerome says that everything intoxicating is
   included; and this I admit to be true; but the definition would be more
   correct, that all liquors espressed from fruits are denoted by it, in
   whose sweetness there is nearly as much to tempt men as in wine. Even
   in these days the Orientals compose of dates as well as of other
   fruits, liquors, which are exceedingly sweet and delicious. The same
   rule is, therefore, here prescribed for the priests, whilst in the
   performance of their duties, as for the Nazarites. Both were allowed
   freely to eat of all the richest foods; but God commanded them to be
   content with water, because abstinence in drinks very greatly conduces
   to frugality of living. For few are intemperate in eating, who do not
   also love wine; besides, an abundance of food generally satisfies the
   appetite, whilst there is no limit to drinking, where the love of wine
   prevails. Therefore, abstinence from wines was enjoined upon the
   priest, not only that they might beware of drunkenness, but that they
   might be temperate in eating, and not luxuriate in their abundance.
   But, inasmuch as sobriety is the main point in moderate living, God
   especially limited His priests in this respect, lest the rigor of their
   minds, and rectitude, and integrity of judgment, should be impaired by
   drinking. Hence it appears how great is man's proneness to all
   defilements. Wine is very wholesome as one of our means of nutriment;
   but by the too free use of it many enervate their strength, becloud
   their understanding, and almost stupify all their senses so as to make
   themselves inactive. Some, too, degrade themselves into foul and
   brutish stupidity, or are driven by it to madness. Thus a pleasure,
   which ought to have incited them to give God thanks, is taken away from
   them on account of their vicious excess; and not without disgrace,
   because they know not how to enjoy God's good gifts in moderation. He
   afterwards confirms the fact, that He interdicted wine to the priests
   when exercising their office, that they may distinguish "between clean
   and unclean," and be sound and faithful interpreters of the Law. On
   this score it became them to be abstemious throughout their whole life,
   because they were always appointed to be masters to instruct the
   people; but lest immoderate strictness should tend to disgust them, so
   that they might be less disposed for the willing performance of the
   rest of their duty, God deemed it sufficient to admonish them by this
   temporary abstinence, that they should study to be sober at other
   times. Thus, then, it must be concluded that none are fit to teach who
   are given to gluttony, which corrupts the soundness of the mind, and
   destroys its rigor. The comment of Jerome is indeed a childish one,
   that "A fat belly does not engender a quick understanding:" for many
   corpulent men are of vigorous and active intellect, and indeed leanness
   is often the consequence of drinking too much. But those who stuff
   their bodies will never have sufficient activity of mind to execute the
   office of teaching. In conclusion, we gather from this passage, as
   Malachi says, (Malachi 2:7,) that the priests were interpreters of the
   Law, and messengers of the Lord of hosts, and not dumb masks For though
   the Law was written, yet God would ever have the living voice to
   resound in His Church, just as now-a-days preaching is inseparably
   united with Scripture.

   Leviticus 21

   Leviticus 21:1-6, 10-12

   1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of
   Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead
   among his people:

   1. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Alloquere sacerdotes filios Aharon, et
   dicito eis, Super animam non contaminabit se quisquam vestrum it,
   populis suis:

   2. But for his kin that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and
   for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his
   brother,

   2. Sed super propinquo suo, propinquo sibi, nempe super matre sua, et
   super patre suo, et super filio suo, et super filia sua, et superfratre
   suo.,

   3. And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had
   no husband; for her may he be defiled.

   3. Et super sorore sua virgine propinqua sibi, quae non fuerit viro:
   super ea contaminabit se.

   4. But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,
   to profane himself.

   4. Non contaminabit se in principe in populis suis, ut polluat sese.

   5. They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
   shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their
   flesh.

   5. Non decalvabunt calvitium in capitc suo, et extremitatem barbae suse
   non radent, et in carne sua non incident ullam incisuram.

   6. They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their
   God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their
   God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

   6. Sancti erunt Dco suo, neque polluent nomen Dei sui: quia oblationes
   ignitas Jehovoe, et panem Dei tui offerunt, proinde erunt sancti.

   10. And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head
   the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the
   garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

   10. Sacerdos autem praecipuus inter fratres suos super cujus caput
   fusum fuerit oleum unctionis, et consecraverit manum suam ut induat
   vestes, caput suum non discooperiet, et vestes suas non scindet.

   11. Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
   father, or for his mother;

   11. Et ad omnes animas mortui non ingredietur, ne super patre quidem
   suo, ant matre sua, contaminabit se.

   12. Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary
   of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him:
   I am the LORD.

   12. Et de sanctuario non ingredietur, neque polluet sanctuarium Dei
   sui: quia corona olei unctionis Dei sui est super eum. Ego Jehova.


   7. They shall not take a wife. The third kind of purity is in marriage
   itself, that the priests' home may be chaste and free from all
   dishonor. At this time also God commands by the mouth of Paul, that
   pastors should be chosen, who rule well their own houses, whose wives
   are chaste and modest, and their children well-behaved. (1 Timothy 3:2;
   Titus 1:6.) The same cause for this existed under the Law, lest those
   appointed for the government of the Church should be despised and
   looked down upon on account of their domestic vices. But God most
   especially had regard to the priesthood of Christ, that it should not
   be exposed to contempt. It was indeed permitted that men should marry
   with impunity a woman divorced from her husband; though in the sight of
   God such an union was unlawful. No law forbade private individuals from
   marrying a deflowered woman; but what was permitted to the multitude
   God condemned in the priests, in order to withdraw them from every mark
   of infamy. And this reason is also expressed when he says that He would
   have the priests holy, because He has chosen them for Himself; for if
   the people had not reverenced them, all religion would have been
   contemptible. Therefore that their dignity might be preserved, He
   commands them to take diligent heed not to expose themselves to
   ignominy. Finally, still more highly to commend reverence to their holy
   office, He reminds them that it related to the welfare of the whole
   people: "I the Lord (He says) do sanctify him," ver. 15. In these words
   He intimates that the grace of adoption, whereby they were chosen as
   His heritage, was based on the priesthood.

   13. And he shall take a wife in her virginity. More is required in the
   high priest, viz., that he should not marry a widow, nor a woman of any
   other tribe than his own. A question may indeed arise as to the latter
   clause, whether the plural word ought to be restricted to one tribe,
   [189] whereas it is elsewhere applied to all. But, if we examine it
   more closely, it is plain that "his peoples" is equivalent to "of his
   people," (populares.) But nothing peculiar will be here required of the
   priest, if his wife is to be taken only from the children of Abraham. I
   admit that the chief priests married wives of Other tribes, as
   Elizabeth, sprung of the tribe of Judah, married Zacharias; but, since
   the high priest is here distinguished from all others, I do not see how
   it would follow that a law or privilege referring to him should be
   observed by the whole posterity of Aaron. On this point, however, I
   will not contend, if any one thing is otherwise. But assuredly, since
   he presented the brightest type of Christ, it was right that superior
   and more perfect holiness should be beheld in him. [190] For this was
   the tendency of the restriction, that his wife, not having known
   another man, should manifest the modesty worthy of her station and
   quality of sacred honor. If any should object that the marriage of, an
   old priest with a young girl was ridiculous and somewhat indecorous, as
   well as liable to many inconveniences; I answer, that special
   regulations should be so expounded as not to interfere with general
   principles. If a decrepit old man falls in love with a young girl, it
   is a base and shameful lust; besides he will defraud her if he marries
   her. Hence, too, will jealousy and wretched anxiety arise; or, by
   foolishly and dotingly seeking to preserve his wife's love, he will
   cast away all regard for gravity. When God forbade the high priest to
   marry any but a virgin, he did not wish to violate this rule, which is
   dictated by nature and reason; but, regard being had to age, He desired
   that modesty and propriety should be maintained in the marriage, so
   that, if the priest were of advanced years, he should marry a virgin
   not too far from his own age: but, if he were failing and now but
   little fitted for marriage on account of his old age, the law that he
   should marry a virgin was rather an exhortation to celibacy, than that
   he should expose himself to many troubles and to general ridicule.

   9. And the daughter of any priest. The moderation and chastity
   (required in the priest [191] ) is extended also to his daughter; and
   by synecdoche all that relates to good discipline is comprised under a
   single head; viz., that his children should be educated in the study of
   virtue, and in decent and pure morality. A heavy punishment is
   denounced against a priest's daughter if she should play the harlot,
   because sacrilege would be combined with her disgraceful
   licentiousness. But it is no light crime to violate God's sanctuary;
   and, if the priest had tolerated such an iniquity in his daughter, he
   would have been no severe avenger of the same turpitude in strangers;
   nay, he would not have been at liberty to punish crimes, unless he made
   a beginning in his own house.

   Leviticus 21

   Leviticus 21:16-24

   16. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   16. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   17. Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
   generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the
   bread of his God.

   17. Loquere ad Aharon, dicendo, Vir e semine tuo per aetates suas, in
   quo fuerit macula, non accedet ut offerat panem Dei sui.

   18. For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
   approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any
   thing superfluous,

   18. Quippe nullus vir in quo fuerit macula, aecedet: vir crocus, vel
   claudus, aut diminutus, aut superfluus:

   19. Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

   19. Aut vir in quo fuerit fractura pedis, vel fractura manus:

   20. Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be
   scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

   20. Aut gibbosus, aut lippus, aut qui habebit maeulam in oculo suo, aut
   cui fuerit scabies vel impetigo, aut qui contritus fuerit testiculo.

   2l. No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall
   come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a
   blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

   21. Omnis vir in quo fuerit macula, e semine Aharon sacerdotis, non
   accedet ad offerendum oblationes ignitas Jehovae: in quo fuertit
   macula, non accedet ad offerendum panem Dei sui.

   22. He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of
   the holy.

   22. Panem quidem Dei sui e sanctitatibus sanctitatum et e sanctis
   comedet.

   23. Only he shall not go in unto thevail, nor come nigh unto the altar,
   because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I
   the LORD do sanctify them.

   23. Atqui intra velum non ingredietur, et ad altare non aceedet: quia
   macula est in eo, ne polluat sanctuaria mea: quoniam ego Jehova qui
   sanctifico vos.

   24. And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
   children of Israel.

   24. Loquutus est itaque Moses ad Aharon et filios ejus, et ad omnes
   filios Israel.


   17. Speak unto Aaron, saying. Priests in whom there was any notable
   bodily defect are here forbidden from approaching the altar. I will not
   curiously inquire into the defects which Moses enumerates, since the
   same rule is here laid down, which is afterwards applied to the
   sacrifices, whereof none but perfect ones were to be offered. For God
   rejected whatever was defective or mutilated, in order that the
   Israelites might know that no victim would suffice for the expiation of
   sin, except such as possessed complete perfection; and this is justly
   required in a priest, who cannot be a mediator between God and men
   unless he is free from every spot. But the analogy must be kept in view
   between the external figures and the spiritual perfection which existed
   only in Christ. God could bear no defect in the priests; it follows,
   then, that a man of angelic purity was to be expected, who should
   reconcile God to the world. The bodily imperfections, then, which were
   here enumerated, must be transferred to the soul. The offering of bread
   comprehends by synecdoche the other offerings, and the whole legal
   service, which the priests were wont to perform in their course; and
   this the words of Moses immediately afterwards confirm, wherein he
   mentions all "the offerings made by fire," besides the bread. We have
   seen elsewhere that any of the people wounded in the testicles were
   prohibited from entering the sanctuary; that they were, not even to set
   foot in the court; but there was a special reason for this as regarded
   the priests, lest they should pollute the sanctuary by their defects.
   Hence it appears how needful for us is the intercession of Christ; for,
   if his perfect cleanness did not wash away our impurity, no oblation
   could proceed from us except what would be foul and unsavory. Moreover,
   it is worthy of observation that the sanctuary of God is polluted by
   any defect or imperfection; and, consequently, that whatever of their
   own men obtrude upon God, is condemned as profane, so far are they from
   conciliating God's favor by any merit.

   22. He shall eat the bread of his God. He permits them indeed to eat of
   the sacrifices, because no uncleanness on account of their natural
   defects could prevent them from partaking of the sacred meals; [192]
   they are only forbidden to appear in God's presence as mediators to
   propitiate Him. And here the imperfection of the legal service betrays
   itself; for nothing could be found among men which could fully
   represent the truth. Since then the defects of men rendered it
   necessary to separate the two connected things, viz., the honor and the
   burden, hence the Israelites were admonished that another priest was
   promised them, in whom nothing would be wanting for the consummation of
   all virtues and perfection. Finally, Moses relates that he delivered
   God's commands not only to Aaron and his sons, but to all the people
   likewise; so that the humblest of them might be the censor of the
   priests [193] if in anything they fell short.

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est insuper Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from
   the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my
   holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

   2. Loquere ad Aharon, et filios ejus ut separent sese a

   3. Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
   generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of
   Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul
   shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.

   3. Dic illis, in generationibus vestris omnis vir qui accesserit ex
   omni semine vestro ad sanctificationes quae sanctificaverint filii
   Israel Jehovae, et immunditia sua fuerit super ipsum, excidetur anima
   ipsius a facie mea: ego Jehova.

   4. What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running
   issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And
   whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose
   seed goeth from him;

   4. Quicunque e semine Aharon fuerit leprosus, vel seminifluus, de
   sanctificationibus non comedet donec mundet se: et qui tedgerit
   immundum super morticinio, ant virex quo egreditur effusio seminis,

   5. Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made
   unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever
   uncleanness he hath;

   5. Ant vir qui tetigerit quodcunque reptile per quod immundus erit, ant
   hominem propter quem immundus erit, secundum omnem immunditiam eius:

   6. The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even,
   and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with
   water.

   6. Anima inquam quae tetigerit illum, immunda erit usque ad vesperam:
   et non comedet de sanctificationibus nisi laverit carnem suam aqua.

   7. And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat
   of the holy things; because it is his food.

   7. Quum autem occubuerit sol, turn erit mundus, et postea comedet de
   sanctificationibus: quia cibus ejus est.

   8. That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat
   to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.

   8. Cadaver et rapture non comedet, et polluat se in eo: ego Jehova.

   9. They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it,
   and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

   9. Et custodiant custodiam meam, et ne portent peccatum propter illud,
   et moriantur propter illud, quum polluerint illam: ego Jehova
   sanctificans eos.

   10. There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the
   priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

   10. Omnis autem alienigena non comedet sanctificationem: inquilinus
   sacerdotis, et mercenarius non comedet sanctificationem.

   11. But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it,
   and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

   11. Quod si sacerdos emerit hominem emptione argenti sui: ipsc comedet
   ex ea, et vernaculus ejus: illi comedent de cibo ejus.

   12. If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may
   not eat of an offering of the holy things.

   12. Filia autem sacerdotis quum fuerit viro alieno: ipsa de oblatione
   sanctificationum non comedet.

   13. But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no
   child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she
   shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat
   thereof.

   13. Filia vero sacerdotis quum fuerit vidua, ant repudiata, et semen
   non erit el, et reversa fuerit ad domran parris sui, sicut in pueritia
   sua, de eibo patris eomedet: onmis autem alienigena non comedet ex co.

   14. And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put
   the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with
   the holy thing.

   14. Quod si aliquis comederit sanctificationem per imprudentiam, addet
   quintam partem ejus, et dabit sacerdoti eum sanctificatione.

   15. And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
   Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

   15. Et non contaminabunt sanctificationes filiorum Israel, quas
   obtulerint Jehovae.

   16. Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
   their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

   16. Neque portare facient cos iniquitatem delicti, dum comederint
   sanctificationes eorum: ego enim Jehova sanctificans eos.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Moses here treats of the accidents
   whereby pollution is contracted, although a man may be by nature pure
   and sound. If any labored under natural defects, Moses prohibited them
   from exercising the sacerdotal office; now, if any extrinsic pollution
   may have affected a priest, he commands him to abstain from his duties
   until he shall have been purified. He had already commanded that any
   unclean person should be separated from the people lest their contagion
   should infect others; it may therefore seem superfluous to prescribe to
   the priests what had been universally enjoined. But since men placed in
   any position of honor are apt to abuse God's favor as a pretext for
   sin, lest the sacerdotal dignity might be used as a covering for the
   indulgence or excuse of scandals, it was necessary to enact an express
   law, that the priests should not plead their privilege to eat in their
   uncleanness of the sacrifices which none but the clean might offer. And
   that their sacrilege might be the more detestable, he denounces death
   against any who should intrude their pollutions into the sacrifices;
   for it was necessary to arouse by the fear of punishment, and as it
   were to drive by violence to their duty those who would not have been
   otherwise restrained by any religious feeling from making God's service
   contemptible. He then enumerates the particular kinds of pollution of
   which we have before spoken. Whence it appears, that the priests were
   brought into discipline by this law, lest they should think themselves
   more free than the rest of the people, thus might indulge themselves in
   security; and this is afterwards more clearly expressed where God
   admonishes them to "keep his ordinance," [194] (ver. 9:) i.e.,
   diligently to observe whatever He commanded; and the greater dignity He
   had honored them with, that the greater should be their study to
   persevere in the exercises of piety; for he shews them that so far from
   their sacerdotal rights conducing to the alleviation of their sin, they
   were more strongly bound by them to keep the Law.

   10 There shall no stranger. It was also necessary to add this, that the
   majesty of sacred things might not be impaired; for if it had been
   promiscuously permitted to all to eat of the sacred bread and the other
   oblations, the people would have straightway inferred that they
   differed not from ordinary food. And unless the avarice of the priests
   had been thus anticipated, [195] an unworthy trade would have
   prevailed; for banquets would have been see up for sale, and the
   priest's house would have been a kind of provision-market. The
   prohibition, therefore, that the meats offered in sacrifice should be
   eaten by strangers, was not made so much with reference to them as to
   the priests, who would have else driven a profitable trade with the
   offerings, or, by gratifying their guests, would not have hesitated to
   bring disrepute on the whole service of God. The Law consequently
   prohibits that either a sojourner, or a hired servant, should eat of
   them; and only gives this permission to their slaves, and those who
   were incorporated into their families. Moreover, He counts the priests'
   daughters who had married into another tribe as aliens. The sum has
   this tendency, that whatsoever depends on the service of God should
   obtain its due reverence; nor could this be the case, if what was
   offered in the temple were not distinguished from common food. Inasmuch
   as they were human beings, they were allowed to subsist in the ordinary
   manner; yet was this distinction necessary, which might savor of the
   sanctity of Christ. This was the cleanness of the priests as regarded
   food.

   14. And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly. A question may here
   arise, why God would have satisfaction made to the priests, if any one
   should have eaten of the offerings; for they deserved punishment rather
   than reward, if they had suffered sacred things to be brought into
   contempt by their promiscuous use. But the error of those is here dealt
   with, who had not reserved for the priests their lawful share. A
   portion, as we shall see, was assigned by God, which they were to set
   aside before they tasted any part of the victim; those, therefore, who
   had sinned by inadvertency, are commanded by Him to expiate their
   fault, to restore so much to the priest, and to add a fifth part. And
   this was done with the object of which we have spoken, lest, if the
   things offered to God were exposed to common use, religion should be
   brought into contempt. What follows afterwards, "and they shall not
   profane the holy things," I interpret as addressed to the priests
   themselves; for this sentence is connected with the previous one, in
   which the injunctions were directed to the priests alone; and this is
   further confirmed by the next verse, which declares that the whole
   people would be accomplices in the sin of the priests if they should
   have polluted the sacred oblations. For thus I take the words, "that
   they should not suffer the people to bear the iniquity," or the
   punishment of the transgression, if the unclean should have touched
   things offered to God. For as the priest is the mediator of
   reconciliation to propitiate God towards men, so his impiety is a
   common iniquity, which brings guilt upon all. The translation which
   some give, "that they should not lade themselves," [196] is further
   from the sense, and altogether wrested. Finally, God again declares
   that in proportion to the greatness of the honor which He had put upon
   them, would be the heaviness and inexcusableness of the crime, if they
   acted unworthily of their calling.

   26. Neither shalt thou go up. When God had prescribed modesty to the
   priests in their whole life, and in their private actions, no wonder
   that He should require especial care of decency and propriety in the
   performance of their sacred duties. He had indeed already desired that
   the priests should wear drawers or breeches when they went into the
   sanctuary; yet not content with this symbol of purity, He forbids them
   to ascend the altar by steps, lest haply the drawers themselves should
   be seen; since the dignity and sanctity of sacred things would thus be
   impaired. By all means, therefore, He would induce the Israelites to
   conduct themselves most purely and most chastely in the exercises of
   religion.

   Numbers 6

   Numbers 6:22-27

   22. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   22. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   23. Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall
   bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

   23. Alloquere Aharon et filios ejus, dicendo, Sic benedicetis filiis
   Israel, dicendo eis:

   24. The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

   24. Benedicat tibi Jehova, et custodiat te:

   25. The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

   25. Lucere faciat Jehova faciem suam super re, et misereatur tui:

   26. The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

   26. Attollat Jehova faciem suam ad te, et constituat tibi pacem.

   27. And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will
   bless them.

   27. Et ponent nomen meum super filiosIsrael, et ego benedicam eis.


   22. And the Lord spake unto Moses. A part of the sacerdotal duties, of
   which mention is constantly made in the Law, is here briefly set forth;
   for God says that He had appointed the priests to bless the people. To
   this David seems to allude in the words:

   "We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord."
   (Psalm 118:26.)

   This doctrine is especially profitable, that believers may confidently
   assure themselves that God is reconciled to them, when He ordains the
   priests to be witnesses and heralds of His paternal favor towards them.
   The word to bless is often used for to pray for blessings, which is the
   common duty of all pious persons; but this rite (as we shall see a
   little farther on) was an efficacious testimony of God's grace; as if
   the priests bore from His own mouth the commandment to bless. But Luke
   shews that this was truly fulfilled in Christ, when he relates that "He
   lifted up His hands," according to the solemn rite of the Law, to bless
   His disciples. (Luke 24:50.) In these words, then, the priests were
   appointed ambassadors to reconcile God to the people; and this in the
   person of Christ, who is the only sufficient surety of God's grace and
   blessing. Inasmuch, therefore, as they then were types of Christ, they
   were commanded to bless the people. But it is worthy of remark, that
   they are commanded to pronounce the form of benediction audibly, and
   not to offer prayers in an obscure whisper; and hence we gather that
   they preached God's grace, which the people might apprehend by faith.

   24. The Lord bless thee. Blessing is an act of His genuine liberality,
   because the abundance of all good things is derived to us from His
   favor as their only source. It is next added, that He should "keep" the
   people, by which clause lie intimates that He is the sole defender of
   the Church, and protects it under His guardianship; but since the main
   advantage of God's grace consists in our sense of it, the words, "and
   make His face shine on you," are added; for nothing is more desirable
   for the consummation of our happiness, than that. we should behold the
   serene countenance of God; as it is said in Psalm 4:6,

   "There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up
   the light of thy countenance upon us."

   Thus then I interpret this clause, that the people may perceive and
   taste the sweetness of God's goodness, which may cheer them like the
   brightness of the sun when it illumines the world in serene weather.
   But immediately afterwards the people are recalled to the First cause;
   viz., God's gratuitous mercy, which alone reconciles Him to us, when we
   should be otherwise by our own deserts hated and detested by Him. What
   follows, "The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee," is a common
   phrase of Scripture, meaning, May God remember His people; not that
   forgetfulness can occur in Him, but because we suppose that He has cast
   away His care of us, unless He actually gives proof of His anxiety for
   our welfare. Finally, it is added, may He "establish peace upon his
   people," which others translate a little less literally, [197] "put
   thee into peace:" and since this word signifies not only rest and a
   tranquil state, but also all prosperity and success, I willingly
   embrace this latter sense, although even its proper signification is
   not disagreeable to me. [198]

   27. And they shall put my name. Although Jerome has rightly translated
   this, "They shall call upon my name:" yet since the Hebrew phrase is
   emphatic, I have preferred retaining it; for God deposits His name with
   the priests, that they may daily bring it forward as a pledge of His
   good will, and of the salvation which proceeds from thence. The
   promise, which is finally subjoined, gives assurance that this was no
   empty or useless ceremony, when He declares that He will bless the
   people. And hence we gather, that whatsoever the ministers of the
   Church do by God's command, is ratified by Him with a real and solid
   result; since He declares nothing by His ministers which He will not
   Himself fulfill and perform by the efficacy of His Spirit. But we must
   observe that He does not so transfer the office of blessing to His
   priests, as to resign this right to them; for after having entrusted
   this ministry to them, He claims the accomplishment of the thing for
   Himself alone.

   Numbers 35

   Numbers 35:1-8

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
   Jericho, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova in campestribus Moab juxta Jordanem. Jericho,
   dicendo:

   2. Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of
   the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall
   give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.

   2. Praecipe filiis Israel ut dent Levitis de haereditate possessionis
   suae urbes ad habitandum, et suburbana urbium ipsarum, per circuitus
   earum dabitis ipsis Levitis.

   3. And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them
   shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their
   beasts.

   3. Eruntque urbes illis ad habitandum: suburbana vero earum erunt
   animalibus eorum, et substantia eorum, et omnibus bestiis eorum.

   4. And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites,
   shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits
   round about.

   4. Et suburbana urbium earum quas dabitis Levitis, a pariete urbis, et
   forinsecus, mille cubitorum erunt per circuitum.

   5. And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two
   thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the
   west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand
   cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the
   suburbs of the cities.

   5. Praeterea metiemini extra urbem a plaga orientali duo millia
   cubitorum, eta plaga meridiana duo millia cubitorum, eta plaga
   occidentali duo millia cubitorum, eta plaga aquilionari duo millia
   cubitorum: et urbs ipsa erit in medio: ista mensura erit eis
   suburbanorum urbium.

   6. And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there
   shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the
   manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and
   two cities.

   6. De urbibus autem quas dabitis Levitis, erunt sex urbes refugii, quas
   dabitis ut fugiat illuc homicida: et praeter illas dabitis quadraginta
   duas urbes.

   7. So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty
   and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

   7. Omnes urbes quas dabitis Levitis, erunt quadraginta octo urbes,
   ipsas et suburbana earum dabitis:

   8. And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the
   children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but
   from them that have few ve shall give few: every one shall give of his
   cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he
   inheriteth.

   8. Et urbes quas dabiris de possessione filiorum Israel, ab eo qui
   plures habuerit, plures accipietis: et ab eo qui pauciores, pauciores
   capietis: singuli pro quantitate possessionis suae quam possederint,
   dabunt ex urbibus suis Levitis.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Although there was no inheritance
   assigned to the tribe of Levi, yet it was necessary that they should be
   supplied with dwelling-places. No lands were given then where they
   might sow and reap; but by way of compensation the tithes were a
   sufficient means of subsistence, even after deducting the tithes which
   were paid to the poor. God now, however, makes provision for their
   residences; and here we must carefully remark, that they were so
   distributed over the whole land, as to be, as it were, guards regularly
   posted for the preservation of the worship of God, lest any
   superstition should creep in, or the people should fall into gross
   contempt of God. For we know that they were chosen by Him, not only to
   attend to the ceremonies, but to be the interpreters of the law, and to
   cherish sincere piety among the people. Now if all had been placed in
   one station, it was dangerous lest the doctrine of the Law should
   immediately fall into oblivion through the whole land; and thus the
   other tribes should grow irreligious. Wherefore the incomparable
   goodness of God here shone forth, since their punishment was turned as
   it were into a reward of virtue, and their disgrace into honor; for
   this dispersion of the tribe of Levi had been foretold by the holy
   patriarch Jacob, (Genesis 46:7,) that their posterity should be
   scattered in that land, which Levi the father of their race had
   polluted by a detestable murder and wicked perfidy. God proved
   eventually that this prophecy, which proceeded from Him, did not fall
   to the ground unfulfilled; nevertheless, although the Levites were to
   be banished here and there in token of their disgrace, yet were they
   set in various parts of the land, that they might retain the other
   tribes under the yoke of the Law. It was then in God's wonderful
   providence that they were rather placed in peculiar and fixed
   residences, than allowed to mingle themselves promiscuously with the
   rest of the people; for the cities which God assigned to them were so
   many schools, where they might better and more freely engage themselves
   in teaching the Law, and prepare themselves for performing the office
   of teaching. For if they had lived indiscriminately among the
   multitude, they were liable to contract many vices, as well as to
   neglect the study of the Law; but when they were thus collected into
   separate classes, such an union reminded them that they were divided
   from the people that they might devote themselves altogether to God.
   Besides, their cities were like lamps shining into the very furthest
   corners of the land. They were therefore fortified, as it were, by
   walls, lest the corruptions of the people should penetrate to them.
   Their association together also should have stimulated them mutually to
   exhort each other to confinehey, decent and modest manners, temperance,
   and other virtues worthy of God's servants; whilst, if they fell into
   dissolute habits, they were the less excusable. Thus their cities were
   like watch towers in which they might keep guard, so as to drive
   impiety away from the borders of the holy land. Hence was the light of
   heavenly doctrine diffused; hence was the seed of life scattered; hence
   were the examples to be sought of holiness and universal integrity.

   4. And the suburbs of the cities. A discrepancy here appears, from
   whence a question arises; for Moses first limits the suburbs to a
   thousand cubits from the city in every direction; and then seems to
   extend them to two thousand. Some thus explain the difficulty, viz.,
   that the parts nearest to the city were destined for cottages and
   gardens; and that then there was another space of a thousand cubits
   left free for their flocks and herds; but this seems only to be
   invented, in order to elude by the subterfuge the contradiction
   objected to. My own opinion rather is, that after Moses had given them
   a boundary of a thousand cubits on every side, he proceeds to shew the
   way in which they were to be measured, that thus he may obviate all the
   quarrels which might aria: from their neighbors. It is plain that, when
   he repeats the same thing twice, the latter verse is only an
   explanation of the former; and thus it would be absurd, that after
   having fixed a thousand cubits, he should immediately double that
   number. But it will be all very consistent, if this measurement be
   taken in a circuit; for if you draw a circle, and then a line from the
   center to the circumference, that line will be about a tenth part of
   the whole circumference; compare then the fourth part of the circle
   with the straight line which goes to the center, and it will be greater
   by one part and a half. But, if you leave a thousand cubits for the
   city, the two thousand cubits [199] in the four parts of the
   circumference will correspond with one thousand cubits from the city
   towards each of the boundaries.

   It is afterwards prescribed, in accordance with equity, that a greater
   or less number of cities should be taken according to the size of the
   possessions belonging to each tribe; for, just as in paying tax or
   tribute, regard is had to each man's means, so it was just that every
   tribe should contribute equitably in proportion to its abundance. As to
   the cities of refuge, I now omit to explain what their condition was,
   because this matter relates to the Sixth Commandment; only let us
   observe that the wretched exiles were entrusted to the care of the
   Levites, that they might be more safely guarded. Besides, it was
   probable that those who presided over holy things would be upright and
   honest judges, so as not to admit men indiscriminately out of hope of
   advantage, or from carelessness, but only to protect the innocent,
   after duly examining their case.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [199] "Les huit mille coudees prinses aux quatre quatriers conviendront
   avec les mille coudees d'espace entre la ville, et les bornes des
   fanbourgs." -- Fr. The more common solution of this difficulty appears
   to be that suggested by Maimonides, viz., that besides the 1000 cubits
   allotted to the suburbs, 2000 more were added for fields and vineyards.
   Rosenmuller, however, demurs to this interpretation, which he does not
   consider the text will bear. I have translated C. word for word, but I
   believe his figures are wrong. It is probable that his theory is the
   same as that of Corn. a Lapide, which he thus more clearly propounds,
   "God seems here to comprise the city and its suburbs in a circle, so
   that the center should be the city, and the circumference should end at
   the distance of 1000 cubits on every side of the city walls. This
   circle He divides into four triangles, each of which is isosceles, i
   e., it, has its two sides equal, which are drawn from the center to the
   circumference. God, therefore, here commands, that the suburbs on every
   side should be extended a thousand cubits, and that the east side
   should be contained in two lines (each, of course, of 1000 cubits)
   drawn from the city to the circumference of the suburbs, which two
   lines comprehend that east side in the shape of a triangle;" and so
   also with the other sides, "so that the two lines drawn to the
   circumference of each side, which are the two equal sides of the
   triangle, should together contain 2000 cubits."

   2. Et etiam fratres tuos, tribum Levi, tribum patris tui, accedere fac
   ad te, et adhaereant tibi, ministrentque tibi: tu autem et filii tui
   tecum stabitis coram tabernaculo testimonii.

   3. And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
   tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary
   and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

   3. Et custodient custodiam tuam, et custodiam totius tabernaculi:
   veruntamen ad vasa sanctitatis, et ad altare non accedent, ne moriantur
   tam ipsi quinn vos.

   4. And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:
   and a stranger shall not crone nigh unto you.

   4. Et adhaerebunt tibi, et custodient custodiam tabernaculi
   conventionis ad omnem cultum tabernaculi: externus autem non accedet ad
   vos.

   5. And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the
   altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.

   5. Custodietis igitur custodiam sanctuarii, ne sit posthac indignatio
   contra filios Israel.

   6. And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
   children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do
   the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   6. Ego enim ecce, sumpsi fratres vestros Levitas e medio filiorum
   Israel vobis donum datos, Jehovae ut ministrent in cultu tabernaculi
   conventionis.

   7. Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
   office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall
   serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift:
   and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

   7. Tu autem et filii tui tecum custodietis sacerdotium vestrum in omni
   ratione altaris, et intra velum exequemini ministerium: munus dedi
   sacerdotii vobis, itaque extraneus qui acceder morietur.

   22. Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
   tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

   22. Neque accedent posthac filii Israel ad tabernaculum conventionis,
   ut portent iniquitatem ad moriendum.

   23. But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute
   for ever throughout your generations, ...

   23. Sed ipsi Levitse facient opus; tabernaculi conventionis, et ipsi
   portabunt iniquitatem suam statuto perpetuo per generationes vestras.


   1 And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons. By this solemn
   appeal God stirs up the priests to devote themselves to their duty with
   the greatest fidelity and zeal, for He declares that if anything should
   be done contrary to the requirements of religion, they should be
   accounted guilty of it, since those are said to "bear the iniquity of
   the sanctuary" who sustain the crime and the punishment of all its
   pollutions. God would have the sanctuary kept clear from every stain
   and defect; and also the dignity of the priesthood was to be maintained
   in chastity and pureness; a heavy burden, therefore, was imposed upon
   the priests when they were set over the holy things as their guardians,
   on this condition that if anything were done amiss they were to be
   exposed to punishment, because the blame rested on them; just as if God
   had said that negligence alone was tantamount to sacrilege. Thus their
   honor, conjoined as it was with so much difficulty and danger, was by
   no means to be envied.

   In this way did God admonish them that the legal rites were of no
   trifling importance, since he so severely avenged all profanations of
   them; for thus it was easily to be gathered that something far more
   excellent and altogether divine was to be sought for in these earthly
   elements. This may also be very properly applied spiritually to all
   pastors, to whom blame is justly imputed, if religion and the holiness
   of God's worship be corrupted, if purity of doctrine impaired, if the
   welfare of the people endangered, since the care of all these things is
   entrusted to them.

   2. And thy brethren also. He here assigns their duties to the Levites,
   that they also may minister, but, as it were, under the hand of the
   priests, viz., that they may be ruled by their commands. Thus the
   authority was in the hands of the priests, but the Levites afforded
   them their assistance. On this ground they are prohibited from
   approaching the altar, or entering the greater sanctuary; in fact, a
   lower degree is assigned to them, half-way between the priests and the
   people. Hence did all learn how reverently God's majesty must be
   served; for although He had adopted the whole people, yet so far was it
   from being lawful that any of the multitude should penetrate to the
   altar, that the Law even kept back the Levites from thence, although
   they were God's peculiar ministers. Moreover, in this figure, we
   perceive how necessary is a Mediator for us to conciliate God's favor
   towards us; for, if it was not allowable for the holy and chosen seed
   of Abraham to approach the typical sanctuary, how should we, who were
   aliens, [200] now penetrate to heaven, unless a way of access were
   opened to us through Christ? Finally, when He forbids strangers from
   meddling with holy things, He does not mean only foreigners, but all
   the people, except the tribe of Levi; for here a distinction is drawn,
   not between the Church and heathen nations, but between the ministers
   of the sanctuary and the rest of the people.

   5. And ye shall keep the charge. He again exhorts the priests to be
   diligent in the performance of their office, with the addition of a
   denunciation of punishment if they failed in zeal and earnestness. Nor
   does He now threaten them alone, but the whole people; neither does
   this contradict the foregoing declaration, inasmuch as the common fault
   of all by no means lightened theirs. Nay, if God punished the innocent
   people on account of the pollution of the sanctuary, how much heavier a
   punishment awaited the priests, (antistites,) by whose fault the sin
   was committed, so that they might be justly accounted its authors.
   Meanwhile let us learn from this passage how sincerely we ought to
   demean ourselves in the service of God, the profanation of which is
   intolerable to Him. Moreover, in order that the priests might engage
   themselves in their duties more actively, and with greater sedulity, He
   shews that they cannot give way to idleness without base ingratitude,
   since they reign in a manner over the whole tribe of Levi, or at any
   rate they hold the supremacy among their brethren. An indirect reproof
   of their negligence, if they do not faithfully fulfill their duties, is
   implied, when God reminds them that He has of His liberality honored
   them with the priesthood. "I have appointed your office, as a gift,"
   [201] i.e., I have gratuitously conferred on you what was otherwise
   yours by no right. Others read it differently, viz., "I have appointed
   your priesthood as a ministration of gift:" but since the meaning
   amounts to the same thing, nor does it make any difference in the main,
   we may freely take our choice.

   22. Neither must the children of Israel. He again inculcates what he
   had before said, that the Levites were chosen to attend to the sacred
   things; since God would not admit all the people promiscuously, as
   before the giving of the Law, when others also offered the sacrifices.
   But, nevertheless, He strongly charges them that they should be
   attentive to the performance of their duties, since, if any of them
   should offend, their crime would be fatal; for so we must understand
   His words, "they shall bear their iniquity [202] to die:" just as in
   the next verse He says that they shall be guilty of all the pollutions,
   for, if the service of God should be defiled by inadvertency, the crime
   shall be imputed to them.

   Numbers 4

   Numbers 4:4-20, 24-28, 31-33

   4. This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of
   the congregation, about the most holy things:

   4. Istud erit opus filiorum Cehath in tabernaculo conventionis Sancti
   sanctorum.

   5. And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons,
   and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of
   testimony with it:

   5. Veniet autem Aharon et filii ejus quando transferenda erunt castra,
   et deponent velum tentorii, et operient illo arcata testimonii.

   6. And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall
   spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
   thereof.

   6. Potentque super illam operimentum pellis taxram, et expandent pannum
   totum hyacinthinum desuper, et imponent vectes ejus.

   7. And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,
   and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers
   to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:

   7. Et super mensam panum hyacinthinum expandent pannum hyacinthinum,
   ponentque super eum scutellas, et cochlearia, et crateras, et opercula
   operimenti: et pants ille jugis super eam erit.

   8. And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the
   same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves
   thereof.

   8. Et expandent super ilia pannum vermiculi coccini, operientque ilia
   opertorio pellis taxaeoe, postea imponent vectes ejus.

   9. And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of
   the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all
   the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

   9. Tollent praeterea pannum hyacinthinum, et operient candelabrum
   luminaris, et lucernas ejus, et forcipes ejus, et receptacula ejus, et
   omma vasa olei ejus quibus ministrabunt ei.

   10. And they shall put it, and all the vessels thereof within a
   covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

   10. Ponentque illud cum omnibus vasis ejus in opertorio pellis taxaeae,
   et portent super vectes ejus.

   11. And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
   cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves
   thereof:

   11. Super altare autem aureum expandent pannum hyacinthinum, et
   operient illum operimento pellis taxaeae, ponentque vectes ejus.

   12. And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they
   minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover
   them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:

   12. Tollent quoque omnia vasa ministerii quibus ministrabunt: in
   sanctuario, et ponent in panno hyacinthino, operientque illa operimento
   pellis taxaeae, et ponent super vectes.

   13. And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a
   purple cloth thereon:

   13. Auferent et cinerem ab altari, et expandent super illud pannum
   purpureum.

   14. And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they
   minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels,
   and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread
   upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.

   14. Ponentque super illud omnia vasa ejus quibus ministrant,
   receptecula, fuscinculas et scopas, et crateras, cuncta vasa altaris:
   et expandent super illud operimentum pellis taxaeae, et imponent vectes
   ejus.

   15. And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
   sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
   forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they
   shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the
   burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   15. Quum autem finen fecerit Aharon et filii ejus operiendi santuarium,
   et omnia vasa sanctuarii quando transferenda erunt castra, tum postea
   venient filii Cehath ut portent: ne contingant sanctuarium et
   moriantur: istae sunt onera filiorum Cehath in tabernaculo
   conventionis.

   16. And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth
   the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat
   offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
   tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
   vessels thereof.

   16. Praefeetura autem Eleazar filii Aharon sacerdotis est oleum
   luminaris, et suffimentum aromaticun, et minha jugis, oleumque
   unctionis, atque praefectura totius tabernaculi, et omniran quae sunt
   in eo, in sanctuario et vasis ejus.

   17. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   17. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   18. Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from
   among the Levites:

   18. Ne excidatis tribum familiarum Cehath e medio Levitarum.

   19. But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
   approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
   appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

   19. Sed hoe facite illis, tum vivent et non morientur: quando
   accesserint ad sanctitatem sanctitatum, Aharon et filii ejus venient,
   et constituent illos, quemque super opus suum, et super onus suum.

   20. But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
   lest they die.

   20. Ne ingrediantur ut videant quando operient sanctitatem, et
   moriantur.

   24. This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,
   and for burdens:

   24. Istud erit opus familiarum Gersonitarum ad ministrandum et ad
   portandum

   25. And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
   tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
   badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of
   the tabernacle of the congregation,

   25. Portabunt cortinas tabernaculi, et tabernaculum conventionis,
   operimentum ejus, et operimentum pellis taxmaeae, quod super illud est
   superne, et aulaeum ostii tabernaculi conventionis.

   26. And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the
   gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round
   about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and
   all that is made for them: so shall they serve.

   26. Cortinas item atrii, et aulaeum ostii portse atrii, quod est juxta
   tabernaculum, et juxta altare per circuitum, et funes eorum, et omnia
   vasa operis eorum, et quaecunque facta sunt pro illis: et ita
   ministrabunt.

   27. At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service
   of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
   service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

   27. Secundum sermonem Abaton et filiorum ejus erit universum
   ministerium filiorum Gersonitarum, juxta omnia onera eorum, et juxta
   omnem culture eorum: et deponetis apud eos in custodiam universa onem
   ipsorum.

   28. This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
   tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the
   hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

   28. Istud erit ministerium familiarum filiorum Gersonitarum in
   tabernaculo conventionis: et custodia eorum erit per manum Ithamar
   filii Aharon sacerdotis.

   31. And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
   service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
   tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
   thereof,

   31. Haec autem erit custodia oneris filiorum Merari, pro ministerio
   eorum in tabernaculo conventionis, tabulae tabernaculi, et vectes ejus,
   et columnae ejus, et bases ejus.

   32. And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
   their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all
   their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the
   charge of their burden.

   32. Columnae item atrii per circuitum, et bases earum, et clavi earum,
   et funes earum, cum omnibus instrumentis earum, et omne ministerium
   earum, et per nomina numerabis vasa custodiae oneris eorum.

   33. This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
   according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation,
   under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

   33. Hoc erit ministerium familiarum filiorum Merari, juxta omne
   ministerium eorum in tabernaculo conventionis per manum Ithamar filii
   Aharon sacerdotis.


   4. This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath. He assigns their
   various offices to the Levites: firstly, lest their promiscuous
   sedulity should beget confusion; secondly, lest ambition should
   stimulate certain of them, [203] from whence disputes and contentions
   might arise. We know how confusedly men work unless a certain rule is
   prescribed to them, lest they should run about in an aimless hurry; and
   whilst each individual desires to anticipate others, an unworthy
   emulation ensues, which afterwards vents itself in quarrels. If,
   therefore, this had not been prevented, the Levites would soon have
   made disturbances in their duty, and contentions would have taken place
   between them. God, then, comes forward, and by His own authority
   confines them all within their proper bounds, and restrains their
   foolish passions. That a more honorable office is assigned to the sons
   of Kohath than to the others, proceeds from God's gratuitous favor; and
   thus all pride was suppressed, lest any should boast of his dexterity,
   or industry, or other gifts. The charge of the Holy of holies is,
   therefore, entrusted to the sons of Kohath; not that they should handle
   any part of it, but only that they should carry on the march its
   vessels, when packed by the priests; for God commands the sons of Aaron
   to come and take down the sanctuary, and carefully cover the veil, the
   altar, and other sacred vessels with their proper covers, before the
   sons of Kohath laid a finger upon them, that thus the reverence of the
   people for holy things might be increased; and besides, that when the
   other tribes should see even the Levites forbidden from touching the
   sanctuary, they might be reminded of their unworthiness and humbled the
   more. Moreover, all cause of envy was removed when the other Levites
   heard that a perilous duty was entrusted to the sons of Kohath, for God
   threatens them with death if they touch any forbidden thing: and
   lastly, admonishes the priests, the sons of Aaron, lest by their
   carelessness they should destroy their brethren; for, if they should
   leave anything uncovered, they would be the cause of their destruction.

   24. This is the service of the families of the Gershonites. The tasks
   which He enjoins upon the sons of Gershon, as well as the sons of
   Merari, are apparently mean and laborious, for it was a hard and also a
   servile work to carry the curtains and the tabernacle, together with
   its coverings, the boards, too, and the bars, and the pillars. But
   hence we learn that in God's service nothing is to be despised, but
   that each and every part of our duty should be cheerfully performed,
   inasmuch as it ought abundantly to satisfy us, that God should have
   deigned to choose us as ministers of His sanctuary, so that neither
   weariness nor pride should ever hinder us in our duty.

   Leviticus 17

   Leviticus 17:1-9

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of
   Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath
   commanded, saying,

   2. Loquere ad Aharon, et ad filios ejus, et ad omnes filios Israel, et
   dic illis, Hoc est verbum quod praecepit Jehova, dicendo:

   3. What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox,
   or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,

   3. Quicunque de domo Israel mactaverit bovem, ant agnum, aut capram in
   castris, aut qui mactaverit extra castra.

   4. And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle
   of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood;
   and that man shall be cut off from among his people:

   4. Et ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis non adduxerit eum, ut offerat
   oblationem Jehovae coram tabernaculo Jehovae: sanguis imputabitur viro
   illi: ipse sanguinem fudit, excideturque vir ille e medio populi sui.

   5. To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
   which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto
   the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the
   priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.

   5. Ut afferant filii Israel sacrificia sua quae mactaturi sunt in
   superficie agri: ut afterant inquam illa Jehovae ad ostium tabernaculi
   conventionis ad sacerdotem, et sacrificent ilia sacrificia
   prosperitatum Jehovae.

   6. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD
   at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for
   a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   6. Spargetque sacerdos sanguinem ad altare Jehovae, ad ostium
   tabernaculi conventionis, et adolebit adipem in odorem quietis Jehovae.

   7. And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after
   whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto
   them throughout their generations.

   7. Et non sacrificabunt ultra sacrificia sua daemonibus cum quibus
   fornicantur: statutum perpetuum erit hoc illis ill generationibus
   eorum.

   8. And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house
   of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a
   burnt offering or sacrifice,

   8. Dices praeterea illis, Quicunque e domo Israel, aut de peregrinis
   qui peregrinantur in medio vestri, obtulerit holocaustum, aut
   sacrificium:

   9. And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off
   from among his people.

   9. Et ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis non adduxerit illud Jehovae:
   tunc excidetur vir ille e populis suis.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. In this, and similar passages, God
   appoints the priests to offer the sacrifices; for although they were
   common to all the people, nevertheless He would have them offered to
   Him by the hand of one person, and in a particular place: first,
   because, if they had been allowed to build altars everywhere, His pure
   and genuine worship would have been corrupted by this variety; and
   secondly, that He might direct the people to the Mediator, because this
   principle was ever to be held fast by believers, that no offerings
   could be legitimate except by His grace. The same doctrine will often
   occur hereafter, where the sacrifices are treated of; but, since we are
   here discussing the priests' office, let it be sufficient to have said
   once for all that it was not lawful for private persons to offer
   anything to God, except by the hands of the priest, to whom this duty
   was enjoined. But, since in this point vain glory is marvelously apt to
   affect men's minds, He threatens His severe vengeance against whosoever
   shall have attempted it. It has already been explained why God chose a
   single sanctuary. He now declares that, unless the victims are brought
   thither, this profanation will be equivalent to the murder of a man. He
   therefore commands that all the victims should be brought before the
   altar, even although those who offer them may be far away; for "the
   surface of the field" [204] means a distant place, lest any one should
   excuse himself by the inconvenience of the journey. He expressly names
   the peace-offerings, because that was the kind of sacrifice whereby
   private individuals were accustomed to testify their piety. God
   declares, then, that their service would be acceptable to Him, if the
   priest should intervene to make the oblation in right of the charge
   committed to him. Finally, this law is ratified unto all generations,
   that its abrogation may never be attempted. The reason for this is
   stated, which has been elsewhere more fully explained, i.e., that a
   single place had been ordained at which they were to assemble; and
   again, that a priest was appointed who might observe the ceremonies
   enjoined by the Law, in order that they might worship God in purity;
   and pollute not nor adulterate His sacrifices by strange superstitions.
   For we have stated that the ancient people were tied to the sanctuary,
   lest religion should be twisted and altered according to men's fancies,
   and lest any inventions should creep in whereby they might easily
   decline into idolatry. The commandment which He gave, then, that the
   priest only should offer the victims, is recommended on the score of
   its great usefulness; viz., because it would restrain the people from
   prostituting themselves to devils. Hence a profitable doctrine is
   gathered, that men cannot be restrained from turning away to idolatry,
   except by seeking from God's mouth the one simple rule of piety.

   8. And thou shalt say unto them. The law is now extended to strangers,
   not those who were heathens, but those who, springing originally from
   other nations, had devoted themselves to pure religion. For, if more
   had been allowed to them than to the genuine children of Abraham, the
   corruption would, according to their wont, have soon spread more
   widely. God, then, would not have His sanctuary defiled by foreigners,
   lest their liberty might make its way amongst the whole people. From
   this latter portion we may gather that the word "kill" [205] which is
   elsewhere taken in a sense, is here confined to the sacrifices; since
   permission is elsewhere given to the people to eat (meat) in all their
   cities and villages, provided they abstain from blood. We must
   remember, therefore, that the question is not here as to their ordinary
   food, but only as to the victims, which were never to be offered except
   at the tabernacle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [204] "The open field," A. V.

   [205] In these verses (8, 9) the offering of a burnt-offering, or
   sacrifices, is only spoken of, from whence C. appears justly to
   conclude that the word "kill" in ver. 3, referred merely to animals
   killed in sacrifice.

   Deuteronomy 17

   Deuteronomy 17:8-11

   8. If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood
   and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being
   matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get
   thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;

   8. Si quid latuerit te in judicio inter sanguinem et sanguinem, inter
   causam et causam, et inter plagam et plagam, in rebus rixarum, intra
   portas tuas, tunc surges, et ascendes ad locum quem elegerit Jehova
   Deus tuus.

   9. And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge
   that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the
   sentence of judgment:

   9. Et venies ad sacerdotes, Levitas, et ad judicem qui fuerit in diebus
   illis, et quaeres, et indicabunt tibi verbum judicii.

   10. And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that
   place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt
   observe to do according to all that they inform thee:

   10. Et facies juxta verbum quod indicaverint tibi e loco illo quem
   elegerit Jehova, et observabis facere secundum omnia quae docuerint te.

   11. According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee,
   and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt
   do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew
   thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.

   11. Secundum legem quam docuerint re, et secundum judicium quod
   dixerint tibi, facies: non declinabis a verbo quod indicaverint tibi,
   ad dextram, aut ad sinistram.


   8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee. The principal office of
   the priests is here described under a single head, viz., that they
   should declare what was right in doubtful and obscure matters out of
   the Law of God; for although God seems only to refer to civil
   controversies, yet there is no doubt but that by synecdoche He appoints
   them to be interpreters of the doctrine of the Law. That their
   authority might be more reverenced in general, He commands the people
   to acquiesce in their judgment even on the most disagreeable points:
   for if their sentence is to be submitted to where a man's life is in
   question, or when any disputes are to be settled, much more is all
   exception taken away with respect to God's worship and spiritual
   doctrine. I confess that the priests are not the sole judges here
   appointed, but that others of the people are associated with them as
   colleagues, yet the dignity of the priesthood is especially exalted.
   The opinion which some hold, that the high priest alone is intended by
   the word judge, is easily refuted; because Moses distinctly enumerates
   the priests, the Levites, and the judge. But it is probable that there
   is by enallage a change of number in it; for it appears from the sacred
   history that several were appointed, where Jehoshaphat is related to
   have chosen "of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of
   the fathers of Israel" to preside at Jerusalem in judgment. (2
   Chronicles 19:8.) Assuredly the pious king would have been unwilling to
   depart in the very least degree from the rule of the Law, and his zeal
   is praised by the Holy Spirit Himself: but this was the arrangement
   made, as appears a little further on, that the high priest held the
   primacy "in matters of the Lord," and the king's governor attended to
   civil causes and earthly affairs. And thus again is confirmed what I
   have lately adverted to, i.e., that the office of teaching was
   entrusted to the priests, that they might solve any difficult
   questions, which is also supported by the words of Jehoshaphat, when he
   says, "And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren --
   between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and
   judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the
   Lord." (2 Chronicles 19:10.)

   Certainly, as the cognisance of capital crimes properly belonged to
   judges of the other tribes, so determinations as to precepts and
   statutes, and the interpretation of the whole Law, was the peculiar
   province of the priests; nor can we doubt but that the words of
   Malachi, (Malachi 2:7,) "the priests' lips should keep knowledge, and
   they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the
   Lord of hosts," were taken from this passage. Now, to come to the sum
   of this, God appoints the seat of judgment to be at the sanctuary; for,
   although in the first verse He seems to nominate the priests and judges
   indiscriminately to the decision of earthly quarrels, yet in the fourth
   verse from this He sufficiently shews that another province is
   committed to the priests, i.e., to keep the people in sound and pure
   doctrine, and to expound what is right -- in a word, to be the teachers
   of the Church. But, although the people were to assent to whatever they
   should decide, so that it would be sinful for them to decline from it
   to the right hand or the left, yet a tyrannical power was not thus put
   into their hands, as if, when they had arbitrarily changed light into
   darkness, their perverted decisions were to be deemed oracular. Their
   interpretation was to be received without appeal; yet, on the other
   hand, this rule was prescribed to them, that they should speak as from
   the mouth of God. It is true that the word here used is, tvrh, [206]
   thorah; which, although it means teaching, yet undoubtedly signifies
   that teaching which is comprised in the Law, nay, it is equivalent to
   the word law. And of this Jehoshaphat is a faithful interpreter, when
   he enumerates the divisions, of which Scripture everywhere shews the
   Law of Moses to consist. Although phy, phi, taken metaphorically, is
   equivalent in Hebrew to discourse, yet it here emphatically expresses
   the sentence which shall be taken from the pure teaching of the Law.
   The children of Israel, therefore, are commanded to do what the priests
   shall have taught them; but how? according to the sentence taken from
   the Law. Nor can it be doubted but that God at the same time furnished
   those, whom He desired to exalt to such a high dignity, with the spirit
   of understanding and rectitude, that they might not deliver any
   improper sentence. And this also is conveyed by the promise, "They
   shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:" since it would have been
   absurd that the people should have obeyed God in vain, and to their own
   destruction. Since now one sole Priest, who is also our Master, even
   Christ, is set over us, wo be unto us if we do not simply submit
   ourselves to His word, and are not ready to obey Him, with all the
   modesty and teachableness that becomes us.

   Numbers 5

   Numbers 5:9, 10

   9. And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
   which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

   9. Omnis oblatio sanctificationum in filiis Israel, sacerdoti quam
   efferent erit ipsius.

   10. And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man
   giveth the priest, it shall be his.

   10. Qued quisque sanctificaverit sacerdotis erit, et tradetur in manum
   ejus.


   9. And every offering. Thus far I have brought together the passages,
   in which Moses treats of the office of the priests, and have briefly
   expounded them, I will now begin to treat of their rights, i.e., of the
   honor which God invested them with, that He might have them ready and
   cheerful in their obedience. Here, however, Moses lightly touches upon
   what he more fully sets forth in other passages, as we shall presently
   see, viz., He assigns to the priests all the holy oblations, the
   various kinds of which He afterwards enumerates. Now, there were three
   principal grounds for this law; -- First, Lest what had been already
   dedicated to God should be profaned by its promiscuous use; for, that
   the sacrifices might retain their proper dignity, it was necessary to
   distinguish the sacred from ordinary meats. Secondly, A vainglorious
   excess in respect to the ceremonies was restrained; for if after the
   victims were killed all the flesh had been returned to the owners, a
   desire of ostentation [207] would have grown up amongst foolish men,
   the rich would have come emulously to gain applause, and when they had
   feasted magnificently, they would have exposed the rest for sale. Thus
   would they have abused their false pretense of worshipping God to the
   acquirement of favor towards themselves. The third ground is that which
   Paul touches upon, viz., that it is just that the ministers of the
   altar should live by the altar, (1 Corinthians 9:13;) for though it is
   an unworthy thing that the servants of God should be attracted by their
   hire, yet was God unwilling that the priests, when they had freely
   bestowed their labor on the worship of the sanctuary, should suffer
   from hunger, lest their alacrity might thus be repressed. For if they
   desired to execute their office properly, it was necessary that they
   should attend altogether to spiritual things, and abandon the care of
   their domestic affairs. If any should object that these were incentives
   to avarice, and that an excellent and profitable calling was set before
   the priests, the reply is easy: whatever came to their share, since it
   was restricted to their own eating, could not have been excessive in
   quantity; for they were not allowed to sell any, nor even to give it
   away to others, as we have already seen, and as will hereafter be
   repeated. Thus then the foul dishonesty of those, who taunt Moses as if
   he had enriched the priests by the spoils of the people, is abundantly
   reftired; for if there were any whose interests he would have desired
   to consult, surely his own sons would have been preferred to all; yet
   to them there is no reference here. Nay, whatever he grants to the
   priests, he takes away from his own sons and their posterity; as if he
   purposely deprived them of advantages which were not otherwise
   unlawful. In a word, the dignity of holy things was alone consulted,
   without any endeavor being made to enrich the priests.

   Numbers 18

   Numbers 18:8-19

   8. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
   charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the
   children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the
   anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.

   8. Loquutus est Jehova ad Aharon, Ecce, ego dedi tibi custodiam
   oblationum incarum, omnes sanctificationes filiorum Israel dedi tibi
   propter unctionem, et filiis tuis in statutum perpetuum.

   9. This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire:
   every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin
   offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they
   shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.

   9. Hoc erit tuum ex sanctitate sanctitatum, residua ab igni: onmis
   oblatio eorum, sire minha eorum sit, sire oblatio pro peccato eorum,
   sive oblatio pro delieto eorum quam reddent mihi, sanctitas sanetitatum
   tibi erit et filiis tuis.

   10. In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it:
   it shall be holy unto thee.

   10. In sanctitate sanctitatum comedes eam, omnis masculus comedet eam:
   sanetitas erit tibi.

   11. And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the
   wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee,
   and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever:
   every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

   11. Hoc etiam tuum erit, levationem muneris eorum, omnes oblationes
   filiorum tibi dedi, et fillis tuis, et filiabus tuis tecum in statutum
   perpetuum: omnis mundus in domo tua comedet eam.

   12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the
   wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD,
   them have I given thee.

   12. Omnem pinguedinem olei, et omnem pinguedinem vini et frumenti,
   primitias eorum quas dabunt Jehovae, tibi dem.

   13. And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
   unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house
   shall eat of it.

   13. Primitiae omnium qum in terra eorum, quas afferent Jehovae, tute
   erunt: omnis mundus in domo tua comedet eas.

   14. Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

   14. Omne anathema in Israel tuum erit.

   15. Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring
   unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:
   nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the
   firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

   15. Quicquid aperit vulvam in omni carne quod afferent Jehovae, tam de
   hominibus quam de animalibus, tuum erit: sed redimendum dabis
   primogenitum hominis, primogenitum quoque animalis immundi redimendum
   dabis.

   16. And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
   redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
   after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

   16. Redemptiones autem ejus a filio mensis redimendas dabis secundum
   aestimationem tuam, pecunia quinque siclorum, secundum siclum
   sanctuarii, qui viginti obolorum est.

   17. But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
   firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt
   sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an
   offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   17. Veruntamen primogenitum bovis, et primogenitum ovis, aut
   primogenitum caprae non dabis redimendum: sunt enim sanctificata:
   sanguinem eorum sparges ad altare, et adipem eorum adolebis: oblatio
   ignita in odorem quietis Jehovae.

   18. And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the
   right shoulder are thine.

   18. Et caro eorum tua erit, ut pectus elevationis, et armus dexter, tua
   erit.

   19. All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of
   Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy
   daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt
   for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.

   19. Omnes oblationes sanctificationum quas obtulerint filii Israel
   Jehovae, dedi tibi, et filiis tuis et filiabus tuis tecum in statutum
   perpetuum: pactum salis perpetuum est coram Jehova tibi et semini tuo
   tecum.


   8. And the Lord spake unto Aaron. He now proceeds to state more fully
   what he had been lately adverting to, as to the rights of the priests
   with respect to the sacred oblations. We must, however, remember the
   contrast, which I spoke of, between the priests of the higher order and
   the Levites; for, whilst the family of Aaron is invested with peculiar
   honors, the other families of the tribe of Levi are abased. God, then,
   assigns to the priests alone all the offerings, in which was the
   greater consecration, called "the holy of holinesses." [208] An
   exception will afterwards appear; viz., that the whole was to be
   deposited, by way of honor, with the priests, out of which they were to
   pay a part to the Levites, who were performing their office in the
   service of the sanctuary. He tells them that this privilege is given
   them "by reason of the anointing," lest the priests should pride
   themselves or magnify themselves on this score; for God's gratuitous
   liberality ought to instruct us in modesty and humility. It is by this
   argument that Paul corrects and represses all vain boasting: "Why dost
   thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?" (1 Corinthians 4:7.)
   Now, the sons of Aaron had obtained their anointing by no other right,
   than that God had been pleased to elect them to it. This is also
   indicated by their privilege being spoken of as "a gift:" but God thus
   more expressly commends His grace, for He makes mention of His gift for
   another reason, i.e., that none should enter into any dispute or
   controversy with the priests on this point.

   9. This shall be thine. He enumerates certain kinds of sacrifices which
   He desired to come to the share of the priests; viz., all the residue
   of the burnt-offerings; secondly, the minha, or meat-offering; thirdly,
   what was consecrated of the sin and trespass-offerings; although the
   following clause, "which they shall restore unto me," seems to be added
   by way of restriction, as if it only designated those sacrifices of
   which mention will be elsewhere made, [209] and by which they purged
   themselves from the guilt of theft, unless it may perhaps be preferred
   to read it as if to the sin and trespass-offerings this third were
   added, wherein people restored what did not belong to them, that they
   might be freed from the guilt of theft. After this He adds the free
   gifts, which the children of Israel vowed, and the first-fruits of oil,
   as well as of wine and corn. But this distinction was laid down, that
   God might more surely prevent jealousy and ill-will; for if there had
   been any ambiguity, many disputes would have straightway arisen, and
   thus the reverence due to sacred things would have been impaired. At
   the same time, however, God prescribes to the priests, that none but
   males should eat of the burnt-offerings, and nowhere else but in the
   sanctuary; for there would have been danger (as we said before) that
   the dignity of these holy offerings would have been lessened, if they
   had been carried away to private houses and mixed with ordinary meats;
   besides, God was unwilling to indulge the priests in sumptuous living,
   but by the very sight of the sanctuary induced them to be frugal and
   sober in their repasts. For this was a kind of military discipline to
   encourage abstinence, that they should go away from their wife and
   family to take their meal. But whatever was offered as a vow, and the
   first-fruits, He allows to be eaten of by the women, and in their
   houses, provided only that no unclean person should touch what had once
   been sacred.

   15. Every thing that openeth the matrix. The same thing is now ordained
   as to the first-born, viz., that the priests should have them also for
   themselves; though at the same time a distinction is inserted, that the
   first-born of man should be redeemed. With regard to unclean beasts,
   the owners were free either to redeem or to kill them. But, since this
   matter is not professedly treated of here, God only briefly declares
   that He gives to the priests whatever profit may be made of the
   first-born. The command that the first-born should be redeemed
   according to the estimation of the priests, does not mean that the
   priests should themselves prescribe the value, as if they had the
   authority to do so; but that estimation is referred to by which they
   were bound according to God's command, as we saw elsewhere; and this
   may be readily gathered from the context, because the price is
   presently added, which God Himself had fixed. As to the first-born of
   clean animals, another law is given, viz., that they should be killed
   at the altar, and their fat burned, whilst the flesh was to belong to
   the priests, like the breast and the right shoulder of the
   burnt-offerings. But, lest any of the Levites or of the people -- since
   men are always eager for innovation -- should ever attempt to violate
   this decree, all controversy is removed in future ages, when God
   declares that what He gave to the priests He would never have taken
   away from them. First, He uses the word edict or decree, [210] which
   others translate "statute:" and then adds the title "covenant," [211]
   in order that its observation may be more sacred, and less exposed to
   contentions and quarrels; for nothing could be more indecent than that
   the priests should dispute regarding their rights and privileges. God,
   then, signifies that He shall be Himself outraged, if any one should
   trouble the priests. By the word "salt," perpetuity is metaphorically
   expressed; in which, however, God appears to allude to the sacrifices,
   which it was not lawful to offer unless seasoned with salt; that the
   Israelites might learn that, by earthly and corruptible things,
   something greater was designated; for we know that salted meats do not
   so easily become corrupt. In a word, this metaphor implies inviolable
   stability.

   16. And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
   unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
   the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

   16. Quod superfuerit ex minha, comedent Aharon et filii ejus: azymum
   comedetur in loco sancto, in atrio tabernaculi conventionis, comedent
   illud.

   17. It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
   their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
   sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

   17. Non coquetur fermentatum: portionem eorum dedi illud ex
   oblationibus meis ignitis: sanctitas sanctitatum est, sicut oblatio pro
   peccato, et sicut oblatio pro delicto.

   18. All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall
   be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of
   the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

   18. Omnis masculus in filiis Aharon comedet illud, statutum perpetuum
   est satatibus vestris de oblationibus ignitis jehovae: qui tetigerit
   eas sanctificabitur.

   26. The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place
   shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   26. Sacerdos oblationem pro peccato comedet, in loco sancto comedetur,
   in atrio tabernaculi conventionis.

   27. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
   there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
   wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

   27. Qui tetigerit carnem ejus sanetificabitur, et si defluxerit de
   sanguine ejus super vestera, illud super quod defiuxerit lavabis in
   loco sancto.

   28. But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if
   it be sodden in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in
   water.

   28. Et vas testaceum in quo coquetur, confringetur: quod si in vase
   aeneo cotta fuerit, defricabitur et lavabitur aqua.

   29. All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.

   29. Omnis masculus in sacerdotibus comedet illam: sanctitas sanctitatum
   est.


   16. And the remainder thereof. He repeats what we have seen just
   before, that the residue of those oblations, in which there was
   peculiar holiness, should belong to the priests; but upon condition
   that they should be eaten nowhere except in the sanctuary. A special
   precept is also given as to the minha, (meat-offering,) that it should
   not be made into leavened bread; for thus the meal, which had been
   already dedicated to God, would be changed into common food, which
   could not be done without profanation. Since, then, God admits the
   priests, as it were, to His own table, the dignity of their office is
   not a little heightened by this privilege; yet in such a manner as that
   by their liberty the reverence due to God's service may not be
   impaired. Afterwards Moses confirms in general terms that right, which
   had been before assigned to them, that they should take what remained
   of the burnt-offerings, on condition that it should be eaten by males
   only, and in the sacred place; in order that God's presence may not
   only act as a restraint on their luxury and intemperance, but, also
   instruct them in the sobriety due from His servants, and, in a word,
   accustom them to exceeding purity, whilst they reflect that they are
   separated from all others. At the end of ver. 18, some translate it in
   the neuter gender, "every thing that shall have touched them shall be
   holy:" but in this passage Moses seems to me to prescribe that none but
   the priests should touch the minha. It was said elsewhere of the altar
   and its vessels, that by virtue of their anointing they sanctified
   whatever was placed upon them; but we now see that ordinary men are
   prohibited from touching sacred things, that their sanctity may be
   inviolate. For we know that the sons of Aaron were anointed with this
   object, that they alone might be allowed to touch whatever was
   consecrated to God. Therefore the verb in the future tense is put for
   the imperative. So also it is soon afterwards said of the victims, ver.
   27, "Whosoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy:" [212]
   because Moses enacts this special law for the priests, that they alone
   should handle the sacrifices. Nor does what immediately follows
   contradict this, "when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof on any
   garment," etc.; for he does not mean to say that the garments or any
   vessels would be consecrated by the mere touch; but it is an argument
   from the less to the greater; if it were not lawful to take a garment
   sprinkled with the blood, or the pots in which the flesh was dressed,
   out of the tabernacle, unless the garment were washed, or the pots
   broken or rinsed, much more were they to beware lest any of the
   ordinary people should meddle with it. For how shall a mortal man dare
   to lay a hand upon that holy thing (sanctitati) which could not even
   cleave to the garment; of a priest without atonement? The sum is that a
   thing so holy should not be mixed with unhallowed things.

   Numbers 5

   Numbers 5:8

   8. But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let
   the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside
   the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.

   8. Si non fuerit viro redhibitor cui restituat delictum, delictum
   restituetur Jehovae, sacerdotis erit, procter arietem expiationum quo
   expiebit eum.


   8 But if the man have no kinsman. This passage, which I have inserted
   from chapter 5 is connected [213] indeed with another subject, and yet,
   because it directly refers to the right of the priests, it was
   necessary to remove it to this place, especially since it expresses
   that kind of sacrifice which Moses has lately adverted to, i.e., when
   they expiated the crime of theft. God did not indeed desire that the
   priests should be enriched by others' losses, nor that thieves should
   go free, if they offered what they had stolen to the priests; but, if
   there were no one to whom they could restore it, He would have their
   houses delivered from (the proceeds of) their sin; and with very good
   reason, since otherwise the very gross offender would have never
   hesitated to plunder the goods of a dead man, if he were without heirs.
   First, therefore, He commanded their property to be restored to the
   lawful owners; and, if they were dead, He substituted their kinsmen,
   who are called g'lym, goelim, on account of the right of redemption,
   which God granted in the Law to relatives, as we shall see elsewhere;
   and because he who was next of kin was commanded to marry the widow of
   one who had left no seed. It was therefore a very uncommon thing that a
   person who had defrauded another had to recompense the loss to the
   priest; for in most cases some successor to the dead man would be
   found.

   Leviticus 7

   Leviticus 7:6-10, 14, 31-36

   6. Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in
   the holy place: it is most holy.

   6. Omnis masculus in sacerdotibus comedet cam, in loco sancto
   comedetur, sanctificatio sanctifica tionum est.

   7. As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
   law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.

   7. Sicut hostia pro peccato, sic hostia pro delicto, lex eadem illis:
   sacerdotis erit qui expiabit eum.

   8. And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the
   priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
   hath offered.

   8. At sacerdos offerens hostiam holocausti alicujus, pellis holocausti
   quod obtulerit, sacerdotis ipsius erit.

   9. And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is
   dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that
   offereth it.

   9. Omnis praeterea minha quae coquebatur in clibano, et omne
   praeparatum in sartagine et in craticula, erit sacerdotis offerentis
   illud.

   10. And every meat offering mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
   sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

   10. Omnis item minha mista oleo et arida, omnibus filiis Aharon erit
   erit unicuique sicut fratri suo.

   14. ... it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the
   peace-offerings.

   14. Panis sacerdotis spargentis sanguinem prosperitatum erit.

   31. And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
   shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

   31. Et erit pectusculum illud Aharoni et filiis ejus.

   32. And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
   offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

   32. Armum autem dextrum dabitis ad elevationem sacerdoti de sacrificiis
   prosperitatum vestrarum.

   33. He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace
   offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

   33. Qui offeret sanguinem prosperitatum, et adipem e filiis Aharonis,
   ipsius erit armus dexter in portionem.

   34. For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
   children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
   and have given them unto Aaron the priest, and unto his sons by a
   statute for ever from among the children of Israel.

   34. Quia pectusculum agitationis, et armum elevationis tull a filiis
   Israel de sacrificiis prosperitatum suarum, et dedi illa Aharoni
   sacerdoti, et filiis ejus in statutum perpetuum a filiis Israel.

   35. This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing
   of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day
   when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's
   office;

   35. Haec est unctio Aharon, et unctio filiorum ejus ex oblationibus
   ignitis Jehovae, a die qua accedere fecit cos ut sacerdotio fungerentur
   Jehovae:

   36. Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
   Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever
   throughout their generations.

   36. Quas praecepit Jehova ut darent eis a die qua unxit cos a filiis
   Israel statuto perpetuo in generationibus suis.


   In these passages Moses confirms what we have seen before as to the
   rights of the priests, and also adds an exception to which he had not
   yet referred. In general, therefore, he claims for the priests whatever
   remained of the holier victims; and distinguishes them by this
   prerogative from the other Levites; from whence we gather how free from
   all self-seeking Moses was, when by God's command he deprives his own
   sons not only of the dignity which was conferred on his nephews, but
   also of their pecuniary advantages. Let none, he says, but the sons of
   Aaron enjoy the sacred oblations, because they are divinely anointed
   that they may approach the altar. But, since some rivalry might have
   arisen among themselves, he adds a special law, that certain kinds of
   offerings should only be taken by the priest who had offered them. For
   although they ought all to have disinterestedly discharged their
   duties, and not to have been attracted by lucre, yet, that all might
   perform their parts more cheerfully, he appoints a reward for their
   labor and diligence. On this account he prescribes that the residue of
   the minha in the peace-offerings, and also the right shoulder of the
   victim, and the flesh that remained of the trespass-offerings, should
   be the recompense of the priest who had performed the office of
   atonement and sprinkling the blood. It is unquestionable that many were
   attracted by the desire of gain, who would otherwise have neglected
   their duties; but this was a proof of God's fatherly indulgence, that
   He consulted their infirmity so that their hire might be a spur to
   their diligence. Meanwhile He did not desire to hire their services
   like those of slaves, so that they should be mercenaries in heart; but
   rather, when He reproves them by His Prophet because there were none of
   them who would "kindle fire on His altar for nought." (Malachi 1:10.)
   He aggravates their ingratitude, not only because they would not give
   their services gratuitously, but because, when they received their
   hire, they defrauded Him who had appointed them to be His ministers.

   Numbers 18

   Numbers 18:20, 21, 23, 24

   20. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in
   their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part
   and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

   20. Dixit autem Jehova ad Aharon, De terra eorum haereditatem non
   habebis, nec portio erit tibi in medio eorum: ego portio tua, et
   haereditas tua in medio filiorum Israel.

   21. And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
   Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the
   service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   21. Filiis autem Levi ecce dedi omnes decimas in Israele in
   haereditatem pro ministerio eorum quia ipsi exequuntur ministerium
   tabernaculi conventionis.

   23. ... that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.

   23. Et in medio filiorum Israel non possidebunt haereditatem.

   24. But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
   heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:
   therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they
   shall have no inheritance.

   24. Decimas enim filiorum Israel quas offerent jehovae in elevationem,
   dedi Levitis in haereditatem: idcirco dixi de illis, In medio filiorum
   Israel non possidebunt haereditatem.


   Deuteronomy 12

   Deuteronomy 12:19

   19. Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
   thou livest upon the earth.

   19. Cave autem tibi ne derelinquas Levitam omnibus diebus tuis super
   terrain tuam.


   20 And the Lord spake unto Aaron. This passage only refers in general
   to the payment of those tithes which were common to all the Levites. We
   shall soon afterwards see that the Levites, by God's command, paid
   other tithes to the priest; and a third sort will be added, which were
   only offered every third year. As to the present passage, God requires
   tithes of the people for the maintenance of the tribe of Levi. It is
   indeed certain that the custom had existed of old among the ancient
   patriarchs before the Law, that they should vow or offer tithes to God,
   as appears from the example of Abraham and Jacob. Moreover, the Apostle
   infers that the priesthood of Melchisedec was superior to that of the
   Law, because, when Abraham paid him tithes, he also received tithes of
   Levi himself. (Genesis 14:20; Genesis 28:22; Hebrews 7:11.) But there
   were two different and special reasons for this payment of tithes,
   which God ordained by Moses. First, because the land had been promised
   to the seed of Abraham, the Levites were the legitimate inheritors of a
   twelfth part of it; but they were passed over, and the posterity of
   Joseph divided into two tribes: unless, therefore, they had been
   provided for in some other way, the distribution would have been
   unequal. Again, forasmuch as they were employed in the sanctuary, their
   labor was worthy of some remuneration, nor was it reasonable that they
   should be defrauded of their subsistence, when they were set apart for
   the performance of the sacred offices, and for the instruction of the
   people. Two reasons are consequently laid down why God would have them
   receive tithes from the rest of the people, viz., because they had no
   part in Israel, and because they were engaged in the service of the
   tabernacle. Besides, God, who as their King laid claim to the tithes as
   His own right, resigns them to the Levites, and appoints them to be as
   it were His representatives. To this the words, "I am thine
   inheritance," refer.

   The manner in which the tithes were employed will be seen afterwards in
   its proper place: it will be sufficient now to remember that the part
   which God had taken away from them and transferred to the sons of
   Joseph was thus compensated for; and since they were withdrawn from
   domestic cares, that in the name of all the people they might be more
   at liberty for, and more intent upon, sacred things, an income for
   their maintenance was thus given them. Wherefore the Papal priests draw
   a silly inference, when they claim the tithes for themselves, as if due
   to them in right of the priesthood; else must they needs prove that
   those, whom they call the laity, are their tenants, as if they were
   themselves the lords of the twelfth part of all landed property; and
   again, it would be sacrilege to appropriate the tithes to their own
   use, and to possess other lands of which they receive the rent. Nor
   does that expression of the Apostle, which they no less dishonestly
   than ignorantly allege, help them at all,

   "The priesthood being changed, the right also is at the same time
   transferred." (Hebrews 7:12.)

   The Apostle there contends, that whatever the Law had conferred on the
   Levitical priests now belongs to Christ alone, since their dignity and
   office received its end in Him. These blockheads, just as if they had
   robbed Christ, appropriate to themselves the honor peculiar to Him. If
   they duly performed their duties, and, giving up all earthly business,
   devoted themselves altogether to the instruction of the people, and to
   the execution of all the other offices of good and faithful pastors,
   unquestionably they ought to be maintained by the public; as Paul
   correctly infers that a subsistence is now no less due to the ministers
   of the Gospel than of old to the priests who waited at the altar, (1
   Corinthians 9:14;) but under this pretext they unjustly lay hands on
   the tithes, as if they were their owners, and with still greater
   impudence accumulate landed properties and other revenues.

   It is probable that when the Roman Emperors [214] first professed
   themselves Christians, either induced by just and proper feelings, or
   out of superstition, or impressed with a pious solicitude that the
   Church should not be without ministers, they gave the tithes for the
   maintenance of the clergy; for whilst the Roman State was kee, the
   people used to exact tithes from their tributary nations. And this was
   the case, too, where there were kings; for the Sicilians [215] paid
   tithes before the Romans obtained dominion over them. Moreover, if
   there was a scarcity of corn in the city, the senate demanded a second
   tithe of the provinces. Nay, we gather from 1 Samuel 8:15, that it was
   a most ancient custom for kings to receive tithes; so that we need not
   be surprised that the Romans should have imitated this example. Whence
   we may infer that, when the Emperors wished to bestow a maintenance on
   pastors out of the public stock, they rather chose a tenth than any
   other proportion, that they might imitate God. And in fact some traces
   of this still remain; for the tithes do not everywhere belong to the
   priests; and it is well known that a good part of them are swallowed up
   by monks and abbots, who were not formerly reckoned among the clergy. I
   need not say that some lands are tithe free. But how would the Pope
   have allowed them to be held by laymen, if, by divine right, (as they
   stupidly prate,) they had been the sacred inheritance of the clergy? In
   conclusion, inasmuch as titlies are to be counted amongst public
   imposts and tributes, let not private individuals refuse to pay them,
   unless they wish to destroy the political state and government of
   kingdoms; but let pious princes take care to correct abuses, so that
   idle bellies may not devour public revenues which are devoted to the
   Church.

   I am thy part. I have just before explained the meaning of this clause,
   viz., that, because the Levites were excluded from the common
   inheritance, God compensates this loss out of what is His, as if they
   received it from His hand; as much as to say, that He in Himself
   afforded a supply abundantly sufficient for their remuneration.
   Meanwhile, they are commanded to be contented in Him alone. Nor can we
   doubt but that David alludes to this passage when he exclaims,

   "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance; the lines are fallen unto
   me in pleasant places," (Psalm 16:5;)

   for he intimates not only that God is more to him than all earthly
   wealth, but that in comparison with Him all that others accounted to be
   most excellent and delectable was worthless. Since now we are all made
   priests in Christ, this condition is imposed upon us, that we should
   seek no other portion. Not that we are actually to renounce all earthly
   goods, but because our felicity is so securely based on Him, that,
   contented with Him, we should patiently endure the want of all things,
   whilst those who possess anything should be no less free and
   unentangled than as if they possessed nothing.

   Leviticus 27

   Leviticus 27:30-33

   30. And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or
   of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.

   30. Onmes autem decimae terrae sive de semine terrae, sive de fructu
   arborum, Jehovae sunt, sanctitas Jehovae.

   31. And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add
   thereto the fifth part thereof.

   31. Si vero redimendo redemerit vir allquid de decimis suis, quintam
   ejus partem addet ultra eam.

   32. And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
   whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the
   LORD.

   32. Et onmis decima boum et ovium, omnium nempe quae transeunt sub
   virga, decima inquam pars erit sanctitas Jehovae.

   33. He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
   change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change
   thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

   33. Non disquiret utrum bonum an malum, neque permutabit illud: quod si
   commutando commutaverit ipsum, erit tam hoc quam illud quod commutatum
   est, erit inquam sanctificatio, non redimetur.


   30. And all the tithe of the land. In these words God shews that in
   assigning the tithes to the Levites, He ceded His own rights, inasmuch
   as they were a kind of royal revenue; and thus He bars all complaint,
   since otherwise the other tribes might have murmured on being unduly
   burdened. He therefore appoints the priests as His receivers, to
   collect in His name what could not be refused without impious and
   sacrilegious fraudulency. In the provision that, where the tithes are
   redeemed by a money payment, a fifth part should be added to their
   value, the object is not that the Levites should make a gain of the
   loss of others; but, because the owners of property craftily aimed at
   some advantage in this commutation of corn for money, frauds are thus
   prevented whereby something would be lost to the Levites by this
   deceptive exchange. On the same grounds He commands that the animals,
   whatever they might be, should be given as tithe, and does not permit
   them to be redeemed by money, since, if the choice had been free, no
   fat or healthy animal would have ever come to the Levites. Therefore,
   in this law a remedy was applied to avarice and meanness, and not
   without good cause; for if the proverb be true, that "good laws spring
   from evil habits," [216] it was necessary that so covetous and
   ill-disposed a people should be restrained in the path of duty by the
   utmost severity. And although such careful provision was made for the
   Levites, yet there was scarcely any period in which they did not suffer
   from want, and sometimes they wandered about half-starved; nay, after
   the return from the Babylonish captivity, the memory of so great a
   blessing did not prevent a part of the tithes from being
   surreptitiously withheld from them; as God complains in Malachi 3:8.
   Whence it appears that it was not without purpose that the people were
   so imperiously enjoined to pay them.

   Deuteronomy 14

   Deuteronomy 14:22, 27-29

   22. Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
   bringeth forth year by year.

   22. Decimando decimabis omnem proventum seminis tui, quod egressum
   fuerit ex agro annuatim.

   27. And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake
   him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

   27. Levitam autem qui intra portas tuas habitaverit non derelinques:
   quia non est ei pars et haereditas tecum.

   28. At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of
   thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:

   28. Tertio autem anno proferes omnes decimas proventus tui anno ipso,
   et repones intra portas tuas.

   29. And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
   thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are
   within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the
   LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou
   doest.

   29. Venietque Levita (quia non est ei portio et haereditas tecum,) et
   peregrinus, et pupillus, atque vidua, qui sunt intra portas: et
   comedent, et saturabuntur, ut benedicat tibi Jehova Deus tuus in omni
   opere manus tuae quod feceris.


   22. Thou shalt truly tithe. He repeats in general terms the law before
   enacted, whereby he claims for God the tithe of all the fruit. He does
   not, however, immediately declare to whom they are to be paid, but
   inserts some provisions respecting other offerings, which I have
   elsewhere explained. But when, soon afterwards, in verse 27, he
   recommends the Levites to them, he shews what is the proper use to
   which they are to be applied. He signifies that it would be cruel to
   defraud the Levites of them, [217] and that they would be wicked and
   unjust if they were grudgingly to pay them the tithes, which were
   theirs by hereditary right, since their tribe possessed no inheritance
   in land.

   28. At the end of three years. Those are mistaken, in my opinion, who
   think that another kind of tithe is here referred to. It is rather a
   correction or interpretation of the Law, lest the priests and Levites
   alone should consume all the tithes, without applying a part to the
   relief of the poor, of strangers, and widows. In order to make this
   clearer, we must first observe, that not every third year is here
   prescribed, [218] but that the years are counted from the Sabbatical
   year; for we shall elsewhere see that on every seventh year the land
   was to rest, so that there was no sowing nor reaping. After two
   harvests, therefore, the tithes of the third year were not the entire
   property of the Levites, but were shared also by the poor, the orphans,
   and widows, and strangers. This may easily be seen by calculating the
   years; for otherwise the third year would have often fallen on the
   Sabbatical one, in which all agriculture was at a stand-still. Now,
   this was a most equitable arrangement, that the priests and Levites
   having been well provided for during two years, should admit their poor
   brethren and strangers to a share. Some part was thus withdrawn from
   their abundance, lest they should give themselves up to luxurious
   habits; and thus it was brought about that not more than a twelfth
   portion every year should remain to them. In sum, there was one
   peculiar year in every seven in which the Levites did not alone receive
   the tithes for their own proper use, but shared them with the orphans,
   and widows, and strangers, and the rest of the poor. "They shall eat
   (He says) and be satisfied," who would otherwise have to suffer hunger,
   "that the Lord may bless thee," (verse 29;) by which promise He
   encourages them to be liberal.

   Deuteronomy 26

   Deuteronomy 26:12-15

   12. When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
   increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given
   it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that
   they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;

   12. Postquam compleveris decimare omnes decimas fructuum tuorum anno
   tertio, anno decimae, et dederis Levitae, peregrino, pupillo, et
   viduae, et comederint intra portas tuas, et saturati fuerint:

   13. Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away
   the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto
   the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
   according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have
   not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:

   13. Tunc dices coram Jehova Deo tuo, Subduxi sanctificatum e domo, et
   etiam dedi illud Levitae, et peregrino, pupillo, et viduae, secundum
   omne prtaeceptum tuum quod praecepisti mihi: non transgressus sum a
   praeceptis tuis, neque oblitus sum.

   14. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away
   ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the
   dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have
   done according to all that thou hast commanded me.

   14. Non comedi in tristitia mea ex eo, neque subduxi ex eo in
   pollutione, neque dedi quicquam ex eo in funere: obedivi voci Jehovae
   Dei mei: feci secundum omnia qum praecepisti mihi.

   15. Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
   people Israel, and the land whieh thou hast given us, as thou swarest
   unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

   15. Respice de habitaculo sanctitatis tuae, e coelo, et benedic populo
   tuo Israeli, et terrae quam dedisti nobis, quemadmodum juravisti
   patribus nostris, terrae fluenti lacte et melle.


   12. When thou hast made an end of tithing. In this passage Moses
   urgently stimulates them to offer the tithes willingly and abundantly,
   by placing God, as it were, before their eyes, as if they paid them
   into his hand: for a solemn protestation is enjoined, in which they
   condemn themselves as guilty before God, if they have not faithfully
   paid the tax imposed upon them; but they pray for grace and peace if
   they have honestly discharged their duty. For nothing can be more
   awakening to men, than when [219] God is introduced as the judge of any
   particular matter. This is the reason why he commands them to protest
   in God's sight that they have obeyed His ordinance in the payment of
   their tithes. To separate, or "bring away out of the house," is
   equivalent to their being conscious of no fraud in withholding from God
   what was His; and thus that they were guiltless of sacrilege, since
   they had not diverted anything holy to their private use. What follows,
   "I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten
   them," must only be referred to the matter in hand; for it would have
   been too great an act of temerity and arrogance in them, to have
   boasted that they had kept and fulfilled the Law in every part and
   parcel. Still this manner of speaking signifies desire rather than
   perfection; as if they had said, that it was the full purpose of their
   minds to obey God's precepts. We must remember, however, what I have
   said, that this properly refers to the legal ceremonies. With the same
   meaning it is soon after said, "I have done according to all that thou
   hast commanded me:" for if they had gloried in their perfection, they
   had no need of sacrifices, or other means of purification. But as I
   have just said, God only invites them to examine themselves, [220] so
   that they may in sincerity of heart call upon Him as the witness of
   their piety.

   14. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning (tristitia) It is clear
   that the sacred offerings are here spoken of; but the question is, what
   is meant by eating in mourning? This is the exposition received by
   almost universal consent; that although want may have tempted them to
   theft and fraud, yet the people assert that, even in their poverty and
   straits, they have abstained from the hallowed things; and to this I
   willingly assent; although this word "mourning" may be taken for the
   anxiety of a mind conscious of its iniquity in this sense, "I have not
   knowingly and willingly eaten anything consecrated to God, so that the
   hot iron (cauterium) of an evil conscience should burn me, in the way
   in which man's guilt ever torments and troubles him." As to the second
   clause, interpreters differ. Some translate the word vr bagnar, [221]
   "to destroy:" as if it were said, that they had suffered nothing to
   perish through uncleanness; but others explain it, I have taken away
   nothing for a profane purpose. My own opinion is, however, that the
   word tm', tama, is used adverbially for "impurely," so that the people
   testify that they are not polluted, or contaminated by withholding
   anything. [222] Thus, in my idea, some do not badly translate it "by
   uncleanness:" for it was not possible for the Israelites to apply the
   tithes to other uses, without contracting pollution by their wicked
   abuse of them. The ambiguity in the third clause is still greater;
   literally it is, "I have not given thereof to the dead." In my version
   I have followed those who refer it to funeral rites; but some suppose
   that the word "dead" is used metaphorically for an unclean thing;
   others, in a less natural sense, for expenses, which do not contribute
   to support man's life. But it does not yet appear wherefore it should
   he said that nothing had been spent on funeral rites. It is true that
   whatever had touched a dead body was unclean; and therefore some
   expound it, that the victims had not been polluted by any connection
   with funeral preparations. But if this sense is preferred, the
   expression must be taken by synecdoche for anything unclean. My own
   opinion however, is, that under this particular head all things are
   included which have a shew of piety. The burial of the dead was a
   praiseworthy office and a religious exercise; [223] so that it might
   afford a colorable pretext for peculiar laxity; in this word,
   therefore, God would have the Israelites declare, that they offered no
   excuse if they had misemployed any of the consecrated things.

   15. Look down from thy holy habitation. Whilst they are commanded to
   offer their prayers and supplications, that God would bless the land,
   on this condition, that they had not defiled themselves by any
   sacrilege, at the same time they are reminded, on the other hand, that
   God's blessing was not else to be hoped for. Meanwhile the expression
   is remarkable, "Bless the land which thou hast given us, a land that
   floweth with milk and honey:" for we infer from hence that the land was
   not so much fertile by nature, as because God daily watered it by His
   secret blessing to make it so.

   Numbers 18

   Numbers 18:25-32

   25. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   25. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   26. Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the
   children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your
   inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the
   LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.

   26. Praeterea ad Levitas loqueris: et dices eis, Quum acceperitis a
   filiis Israel decimas quas vobis ab illis dedi in haereditatem vestram,
   tunc offeretis ex illis oblationem Jehovae decimas ex decimis.

   27. And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though
   it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the
   winepress.

   27. Et reputabitur vobis oblatio vestra, ut frumentum ex area, et ut
   plenitudo e torculari.

   28. Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all
   your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall
   give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest.

   28. Sic offeretis vos quoque oblationem Jehovae ex onmibus decimis
   vestris quas acceperitis a filiis Israel, et dabitis ex illis
   oblationem Jehovae Aharon sacerdoti.

   29. Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
   LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of
   it.

   29. Ex omnibus oblationibus vestris offeretis omnem oblationem Jehovae,
   ex omni pinguedine ejus, sanctificationem ipsius ex eo.

   30. Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
   thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the
   increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.

   30. Ac dices illis, Quum attuleritis pinguedinem eius ex co,
   reputabitur Levitis ut fructus arere, et ut fructus torcularis.

   31. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it
   is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   31. Comedetis autem illud ill omni loco vos et domus vestra: quia
   merces est vobis pro ministerio vestro in tabernaculo conventionis.

   32. And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from
   it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the
   children of Israel, lest ye die.

   32. Et non portabitis super eo peccatum, quum vos obtuleritis
   pinguedinem ejus ex eo: et sanctiticationes filiorum Israel non
   polluetis, ne moriamini.


   25. And the Lord spake unto Moses. This is another kind of tithe, i.e.,
   a hundredth part of the whole produce, which the Levites paid to the
   priests. Some reckon a third kind; but I have given my reasons why I do
   not agree with this opinion. Assuredly it is not probable that in the
   same year double tithes were exacted and paid. Let this twofold
   division, therefore, be enough for us. A larger portion was given to
   the priests, not only as an honorable distinction, but. because greater
   holiness and integrity in expending them was expected from them; and
   also that they might meet many peculiar burdens. Lest then the Levites
   should be too sordid and niggardly, God declares that their theft would
   be no less wicked if they dealt dishonestly towards the priests, than
   as if the people should withhold any part of their own just share; for
   this is the object of the words, that the tithe of the tithes, which
   they are commanded to pay, should be as if they paid it from the
   threshing-floor and the wine-press, (ver. 27;) as though it were said
   that they were no more exempted from the second tithes, than the people
   from the first. The precept is then still further extended, viz., that
   they should offer a part of all the offerings. Thirdly, sincere
   liberality is inculcated upon them, that they should not lay aside as
   the priests' portion anything that was lean or out of condition, or in
   any respect of inferior quality, but that they should rather offer
   whatever was most choice; for this is what is meant by the word chlv,
   cheleb, [224] which some translate adeps; the word pinguedo seemed more
   suitable, in which, however, there is a metaphor contained.

   31. And ye shall eat it. Because the tithes were reckoned to be amongst
   the sacred oblations, a question might arise, whether it was lawful to
   eat them anywhere except in the sanctuary. God therefore declares, that
   when the Levites had separated the deuuterodekatas (the second tithes,)
   the residue passed into the nature and condition of ordinary meats;
   inasmuch as they might then eat in any place of the bread made of
   tithe-corn, like the produce of their own fields. The reason, which is
   subjoined, seems to be by no means appropriate; via, that it was the
   reward for the labor which they bestowed on the service of the
   tabernacle; for hence it was rather to be inferred, that this food was
   peculiarly destined for the ministers, whilst they were discharging
   their official duties, and keeping watch in the tabernacle, or killing
   the victims at the altar. But since by God's command they were
   scattered over the whole land, and did not cease to be ministers of the
   tabernacle on account of the distance of their residence, it was justly
   permitted that, wherever they might be, they should eat of the meat
   appointed them by God. If it were allowable to take the particle ky,
   ki, [225] adversatively, the sense would be clearer. In the next verse
   he confirms the same declaration, i.e., that they should be free from
   all guilt when they had honestly paid the priests. Yet at the same time
   they are strictly admonished that they should not commit themselves by
   any fraud; for God declares that it would amount to sacrilege, if they
   should have thievishly embezzled any of it, and threatens them with
   capital punishment; for "to pollute the holy things" of the people, is
   equivalent to profaning whatever was consecrated in the name of the
   whole people.

   Deuteronomy 18

   Deuteronomy 18:1-8

   1. The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no
   part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the
   LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

   1. Non erit sacerdotibus Levitis: et toti tribui Levi portio et
   haereditas cum reliquo Israele, oblationes ignitas Jehovah, et
   haereditatem ejus comedent.

   2. Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the
   LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

   2. Et haereditas non erit illi in medio fratrum suorum, Jehova est
   haereditas ejus, quemadmodum dixit illi.

   3. And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that
   offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto
   the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

   3. Istud autem erit jus sacerdotum a populo, quoad sacrificantes
   sacrificium, sive bovem, sive agnum, dabunt sacerdoti armum, et
   maxillas, et ventriculum.

   4. The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and
   the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

   4. Primitias frumenti tui, vini tui, et olei tui, et primitias velleris
   ovium tuarum dabis illi.

   5. For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand
   to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

   5. Ipsum enim elegit Jehova Deus tuus e cunctis tribubus ruts, ut stet
   administrandum nomini Jehovae, ipse et filii ejus omnibus diebus.

   6. And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where
   he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place
   which the LORD shall choose;

   6. Quum autem venerit Levita ex allqua portarum tuarum, ex omni
   Israele, ubi ipse peregrinabitur, et venerit toto desiderio animae suae
   ad locum quem elegerit Jehova:

   7. Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his
   brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.

   7. Ministrabit nomini Jehovae Dei sui, dent omnes fratres ejus Levitin
   qui stant illic coram Jehova.

   8. They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of
   the sale of his patrimony.

   8. Partera similem parti altorum comedent, praeter venditiones ejus ad
   partes.


   1. The priests, the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi. This chapter
   contains three principal heads; for first, God shews that there was no
   reason why the Israelites should be aggrieved at paying tithes to the
   Levites, and at remitting the first-fruits and other oblations to the
   priests, since this tribe was deprived of their inheritance. Secondly,
   He obviates all quarrels, and prevents unlawful gains and pilferings,
   by assigning their just share to the priests and Levites. Thirdly, He
   defines how the oblations should be parted among them, and what part of
   the victims the priests were to take. As to the first clause, since God
   was as it were the lot of their inheritance, they justly claimed to
   themselves the right which he had transferred to them. If it were
   disagreeable to the people that their revenue should be tithed, God
   came as it were between, and declaring that it was His property in His
   right as King, appointed the Levites to be His stewards and collectors
   for receiving it. There was then no ground for any one to raise a
   dispute, unless he chose professedly to rob God. But this declaration
   often occurs; since it was of great importance that the people should
   be assured that God accounted as received by Himself what He had
   assigned to the Levites; not. only lest any portion should be withheld
   from them, but also that every one should willingly pay the lawful dues
   of God's ministers; and again, lest any should wickedly murmur because
   the first-fruits and some portion of the sacrifices were appropriated
   for the subsistence of the priests. Another reason is also expressed,
   why the honor assigned to the priests should be paid without grudging;
   viz., because God had appointed them to be the ministers of His
   service; but "the laborer is worthy of his hire."

   3. And this shall be the priests' due. It is not only for the sake of
   the priests that God enumerates what He would have them receive, that
   they may obtain what is their own without murmuring or dispute; but He
   also has regard to the people, lest the priests should basely and
   greedily take more than their due; which sacred history relates to have
   been done by the sons of Eli, (1 Samuel 2:23,) for they had advanced to
   such a degree of licentiousness, that, like robbers, they seized
   violently on whatever their lust desired. Lest therefore they should
   give way to this gross covetousness, God prescribes to them certain
   limits, to which they were to confine themselves, so that if they
   transgressed them, it was easy for any of the people to convict them of
   avarice.

   6. And if a Levite come. This third head more clearly explains what is
   elsewhere more obscurely declared; for God seemed to curtail from the
   Levites whatever He gave to the priests. But He now more distinctly
   places the priests in the first rank, yet so that they should admit the
   Levites on the score of their labor's to a share of the oblations. This
   is the sum of the law, that the Levites who remained at home, should be
   content with the tithes, and touch nothing of the other offerings; but
   that from whithersoever they should come to the sanctuary, they were to
   be accounted as ministers and take their proper place. By this law
   then, it was provided that none should be excluded on the ground of the
   intermission of their duties; and that the condition of those that
   dwelt elsewhere should not be worse than of those who lived at
   Jerusalem. For although they might reside in other cities, they did not
   altogether cease from their ministry, since they had other duties to
   perform besides that of sacrificing the victims. Yet those who entirely
   devoted themselves to the work of the sanctuary, were endowed by God
   with double honor; since it was by no means just that they should be
   defrauded of their maintenance, who bade adieu to domestic cares and
   labors, and occupied themselves totally in holy offices. That this
   distribution was not superfluous, will best appear from the narrative
   of Josephus, who relates that the [226] priests seized on the tithes by
   violence, and deprived the Levites of their subsistence by hostile
   measures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [226] About this time King Agrippa gave the high priesthood to Ismael,
   who was the son of Fabi. And such was the impudence and boldness that
   had seized on the high priests, that they had the hardiness to send
   their servants into the threshing-floors, to take away those tithes
   that were due to the priests; insomuch that it so fell out that the
   poorer sort of the priests died for want." -- Whiston's Josephus.

   5. And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two
   tenth-deals shall be in one cake.

   5. Accipies similam, et coques ex ea duodecim placentas: duarum
   decimarum sit unaquseque placenta.

   6. And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
   table before the LORD.

   6. Et pones eas in duobus ordinibus: seni ordines super mensam mundam
   coram Jehova.

   7. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be
   on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the
   LORD.

   7. Pones quoque super ordinem utrunque thus purum, eritque pani in
   memoriale et incensum Jehovae.

   8. Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually,
   being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

   8. Per singula sabbatha ordinabit illos coram Jehova semper, a filiis
   Israel foedere sempiterno.

   9. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the
   holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD
   made by fire by a perpetual statute.

   9. Et erit Aharonis et filiorum ejus, qui comedent eum in loco sancto:
   quia sanctitatis sanctitatum est ei ex oblationibus ignitis Jehovae
   statuto perpetuo.

   We now come to the third part of the external service of God, which
   will bring us to the end of our exposition of the Second Commandment.
   We have, then, now to treat of the sacred oblations, the first place
   amongst which I have thought it best to give to the loaves, which had
   their peculiar table opposite the candlestick on the north side, as we
   saw in the construction of the Tabernacle; for although the mention of
   them will recur elsewhere, yet, since they were offered separately, and
   placed before the Ark of the Covenant, as it were in God's sight, they
   must not be treated of apart from the sacrifices. I have already
   explained that this was no ordinary symbol of God's favor, when He
   descended familiarly to them, as if He were their messmate. They were
   called "the bread of faces," [227] because they were placed before the
   eyes of God; and thus He made known His special favor, as if coming to
   banquet with them. Nor can it be doubted but that He commanded them to
   be twelve in number, with reference to the twelve tribes, as if He
   would admit to His table the food offered by each of them. The "two
   tenths" make the fifth part of the epah. And it is plaia indeed that
   this rite was thus accurately prescribed by God, lest diversity in so
   serious a matter might gradually give birth to many corruptions. In the
   word "tenths," He seems to allude to the tax which He had imposed on
   the people, that thus the holiness of the loaves might be enhanced. But
   why He required two "tenths" rather than one I know not, nor do I think
   it any use more curiously to inquire. I refer to the frankincense the
   words, "that it may be on the bread for a memorial:" as if it were said
   that the bread, seasoned by the smell of the incense, would renew the
   memory of the children of Israel, so that they should be of sweet savor
   before God. Others translate it "a monument" instead of "for a
   memorial," but with the same meaning. But although some think that the
   bread itself is called a memorial, it is more applicable to the
   frankincense; for it is afterwards added, that the incense should be at
   the same time a burnt sacrifice, viz., because in it the bread was, as
   it were, offered in burnt sacrifice.

   Exodus 29

   Exodus 29:38-46

   38. Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs
   of the first year day by day continually.

   38. Hoc est quod facies super altare, agnos anniculos jugiter in
   singulos dies.

   39. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb
   thou shalt offer at even:

   39. Agnum unum facies mane, et agnum unum inter duas vesperas.

   40. And with the one lamb a tenth-deal of flour mingled with the fourth
   part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for
   a drink offering.

   40. Et decimam partem similae mistae oleo contuso, quartam partem hin
   et libamen, quartam partem hin vini in agnam unum.

   41. And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto
   according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the
   drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire
   unto the LORD.

   41. Agnum alterum facies inter duas vesperas sicut minha matutino, et
   sicut libamini ejus facies ei in odorem quietis, oblationem ignitam
   Jehovae.

   42. This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
   generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before
   the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

   42. Holocaustum juge in generationes vestras, ad ostium tabernaculi

   43. And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
   tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

   43. Et conveniam illie cum filiis Israel, et locus sanctificabitur in
   gloria mea.

   44. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
   altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me
   in the priest's office.

   44. Sanctificabo tabernaculum conventionis et altare, Aharonem quoque
   et filios ejus, et sacrificia, ut sacerdotio fungantur mihi.

   45. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their
   God.

   45. Habitaboqne in medio filiorum Israel, et ero ipsis in Deum.

   46. And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them
   forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the
   LORD their God.

   46. Et scient quod sum Jehova Dens eorum, qui eduxi eos e terra
   AEgypti: ut habitarem in medio eorum. Ego Jehova Deus eorum


   The custom of sacrificing has always been in use among all nations, and
   its origin is doubtless to be traced to the ancient Fathers; but after
   the whole world had fallen away into superstition, first of all, the
   rites themselves became degenerate, when every one invented something
   new for himself, and made an absurd mimicry of whatever remained having
   any similarity, since they no longer retained their proper end and use.
   All heathendom was ignorant of the reason why it was needful that God
   should be appeased by blood; and therefore they shed the blood of their
   victims unreasonably, inasmuch as they did not know themselves to be
   guilty before God, so as humbly to seek for pardon; and much less did
   they apply their minds to embrace the atonement, which was not only
   predestinated in God's secret counsels, but likewise promised to men.
   Hence we infer that all the religious services of the Gentiles were
   rejected of God, (reprobatos,) since they were not based upon His word.
   Only let this be deemed sure, that, by the very custom of sacrifice,
   adulterated as it was, they were convicted of their own unworthiness,
   so that they should have acknowledged that God can only be propitiated
   towards the human race through the medium of a reconciliation. Foolish,
   then, was the philosophy of Pythagoras, which held that God's name was
   contaminated by sacrifices; for thus does the Poet introduce him,
   inveighing against the eating of flesh, (eis ten sarkophagian)

   "Nor will the sin itself their hearts content:
   The very gods must share that guilty deed,
   And He, they think, who reigns omnipotent,
   Joys to behold the patient victim bleed.
   Spotless it stands, of perfect form confess'd,

   (Its beauty nerves the hand which else might spare,)
   Before the shrine, with gold and fillets dress'd,
   And all unconscious, hears its murderer's prayer.
   It sees the fruits itself has toiled to rear
   Placed on its horned brow; and as the blow
   Descends, perchance the blood-stained knives appear,
   Mirror'd before it in the streamlet's flow." [228]

   He [229] was pained that an innocent animal should be slain for man's
   sin; but he might have considered, what it was gross ignorance not to
   feel, that men are but too impudently audacious and foolhardy if they
   come into God's presence to ask His pardon, seeing that He is justly
   offended with them all. There is, therefore, nothing absurd in
   submitting to the eyes of sinners that judgment of death which they
   deserve, in order that, descending into themselves, they may begin
   seriously to abominate the sin in which they fondly indulged
   themselves. But this was the chief cause of the error of Pythagoras,
   that he knew not that God could not be reconciled without an expiation.
   Since, however, this is a thing which is beyond the reach of the human
   mind, let us, who have ever truly sought after God, learn, under the
   guidance and teaching of Scripture, that He has appointed the
   propitiation to be by blood; so that, before the delivery of the Law,
   religion was always sanctioned by sacrifices. Nor can it be doubted but
   that by the sacred inspiration of the Spirit, the holy fathers were
   directed to the Mediator, by whose death God was hereafter to be
   appeased; and surely if Christ be put out of sight, all the sacrifices
   that may be offered differ in no respect from mere profane butchery.
   But afterwards a clearer revelation was added in the Law; and since
   many modes of sacrificing were heaped together by the Gentiles, God
   left out no part of them at all which might afford a profitable
   exercise for believers, whether their piety was to be testified, or
   thanksgivings to be made, or zeal to be added to their prayers, or
   purification to be sought, or sins to be atoned for. Yet the twofold
   division of them is complete and clear when we say that some of them
   were expiatory, and others testimonies of gratitude. Thus, under the
   first head I include the rites of consecration, by which God would have
   the priests initiated, since purification was their main object.
   Moreover, since it is plain that God can listen to no prayers without
   the intercession of Christ, the constant morning and evening sacrifice
   was instituted to consecrate the prayers of the Church; and, even when
   they only celebrated the bounties of God, blood was shed, that they
   might know that not even their gratitude was acceptable to Him, except
   through the sacrifice of the Mediator; in a word, that nothing pure can
   proceed from men unless purged by blood.

   38. Now this is that which thou shalt offer. I have thought it well to
   give the first place among the sacrifices to that daily one which is
   called the continual sacrifice; for God would have two lambs offered to
   Him every morning and evening, that the people might perpetually
   exercise themselves in the recollection of the future reconciliation.
   But, although the sacrifices were constantly repeated under the Law,
   inasmuch as their offering had no efficacy in expiating sin, yet it
   must be observed that, as the priest entered once every year into the
   holy of holies with blood, so it was profitable that another kind of
   victim should be daily set before the people's eyes, in order that they
   might reflect that they had constant need of being reconciled to God.
   Propitiation was, therefore, daily made with two lambs, that the
   Israelites, being reminded of their guilt and condemnation, from the
   beginning to the end of the day, might learn to fly to God's mercy. The
   lamb chosen for this sacrifice was spotless and entire, for the mention
   of its age (one year) implies its perfection or entireness. It was
   offered with a cake made with oil, and a libation of wine; and
   doubtless the ancients were reminded by these symbols that it is not
   lawful to offer anything tasteless to God. True that God was not
   gratified by their sweet savor, neither did He desire to accustom the
   priests to delicacies that they might be epicures under color of
   religion; for the scent of wine cannot in itself be pleasing to God;
   but the object of these seasonings was that the people should not rest
   in the bare and empty figures, but should acknowledge that something
   better and more excellent underlay them. The savor of the wine and oil,
   then, was nothing else than the spiritual truth; that the people, for
   their part., might bring to the sacrifices faith and repentance. And
   assuredly the external ceremony without the reality would have been
   mere folly. Even heathen nations partially imitated this rite; whence
   those words of Horace, --

   "Utque sacerdotis fugitivus, liba recuso:" [230]
   "And like a runaway from priests, cakes I refuse:"

   whereby he implies that cakes were universally offered to idols. But
   this was a mere blind mimicry, for they looked no higher, but thought
   that their gods took delight, like, human beings, in sweet and delicate
   foods; whilst, as I have above hinted, God's intention was very
   different; for, by the, external savor, He desired to arouse His
   people, so that, being affected by a serious feeling of repentance, and
   by pure faith, they should seek for the remission of their sins, not in
   these lambs which they saw slain, but in the victim promised to them.
   They called it the "continual" sacrifice, because God commanded it to
   be offered continually through all generations; but it appears from
   Daniel that it was temporary, for it ceased at the coming of Christ;
   for so speaks the angel: Christ

   "shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of
   the week he shall cause the continual sacrifice, and the oblation
   (minha) to cease." [231] (Daniel 9:27.)

   It is clear that he speaks of this kind of sacrifice. Hence we
   assuredly gather that by this sacrifice the minds of the people were
   directed to Christ. But if this was its use and object with the
   ancients, the profit of it now returns upon us, that we may know that
   whatever was then shewn under the figure was fulfilled in Christ. God
   promises that this sacrifice would be to Him "a savor of rest." [232]
   We may not, therefore, doubt but that He has been altogether
   propitiated to us by the sacrifices of His only-begotten Son, and has
   remitted our sins. But although Christ was once offered, that by that
   one offering He might consecrate us for ever to God, yet by this daily
   sacrifice under the Law, we learn that by the benefit of His death
   pardon is always ready for us, as Paul says [233] that God continually
   reconciles Himself to the Church when He sets before it the sacrifice
   of Christ in the Gospel As to the word minha, [234] although it is
   derived from, nchh nachah, which means to offer, still we must consider
   it to be peculiarly applied to this oblation, which was a kind of
   appendix to the daily sacrifice. There are some, too, who restrict it
   to the evening sacrifice alone, but, when it is used in connection with
   victims, it is also extended generally to other offerings.

   42. At the door of the tabernacle [235] of the congregation. This
   passage shews us in what sense the word mvd mogned, is used, when it is
   employed in connection with the tabernacle. Some translate it
   "testimony:" others, "church:" others, "assembly," (conventum;) others,
   "appointment," (constitutum;) but its etymology is sufficiently shewn
   in this passage; for, when Moses gives the reason of its appellation,
   he uses the word ygd yagnad, from whence it is derived. What, then, is
   the tabernacle of the convention? God Himself answers, that it is the
   place which He has chosen and appointed unto His people, that they may
   there mutually come to agreement with each other. Some conceive its
   root to be, dh gnadah, which is to make protestation as by a solemn
   rite; but since this is opposed to grammar, I will take what is
   certain. The word yd yagnad, in this construction, means to contract or
   agree with another, or at least to meet for the transaction of mutual
   business; no word, therefore, has appeared to me more nearly equivalent
   to it than convention; for the fact that God invited them to familiar
   colloquy, was of the greatest weight in preserving the modest reverence
   of the faithful towards the priests. In the next verse He repeats to
   them, addressing them in the third person, that whosoever shall desire
   to be reckoned among the Israelites, should not turn away or wander
   elsewhere; for a law is laid down for all the children of Israel, that
   they should seek God there. Another confirmation is subjoined, i.e.,
   that this place ought to be sanctified, because God will there
   magnificently display His glory. In fine, from the whole passage, it
   appears that God's design was to keep the people bound to Him by the
   tie of the Levitical priesthood; yet we must observe that it is God
   alone who sanctifies both the place and the offerings, as well as the
   men themselves. Wherefore frivolous is the boast of those who arrogate
   more than God has conferred upon them. If we believe the Pope, in him
   is the holiness of holiness; yet, since he does not produce God's
   authority for this, but vaunts himself of titles invented without
   foundation, we may safely laugh at his stupid impudence. But from this
   and similar passages, our doctrine is taken that Christ ought not to be
   estimated humanly, but according to His heavenly and divine power.
   Hence, too, is refuted the boast of the Popish priests that they offer
   Christ; for we must always ask them, By what authority? since God
   claims for Himself alone this right of sanctifying those who exercise
   the lawful priesthood.

   46. And they shall know that I am the Lord. In these words God
   signifies that He has not only been the deliverer of His people on one
   occasion, but with the object of presiding over their welfare, and of
   demonstrating practically that He dwells among them. He, moreover,
   appointed the sanctuary to be the symbol of His presence, and, as it
   were, its pledge; from whence He would have the rule of piety proceed,
   and be sought for by His worshippers.

   Numbers 28

   Numbers 28:1-15

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and
   my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me,
   shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

   2. Praecipe filiis Israel, et dic eis, Oblationem meam, panem meum in
   oblationibus meis ignitis in odorem quietis meae custodietis, ut
   offeraris mihi tempore suo.

   3. And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire
   which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without
   spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

   3. Dices praeterea illis, Haec est oblatio ignita quam i Jehovah, agnos
   anniculos immaculatos duos quotidie holocaustum juge.

   4. The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb
   shalt thou offer at even;

   4. Agnum unum facies mane, et agnum alterum inter duas vesperas.

   5. And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled
   with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

   5. Et offeres decimam partem epha similac et in minham permistae oleo
   contuso, cum quarta parte hin.

   6. It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai
   for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

   6. Istud est holocaustum juge quod factum est in monte Sinai, in odorem
   quietis, oblationem ignitam Jehovae.

   7. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin
   for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to
   be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

   7. Porro libamen ejus quartam partem hin per singulos agnos in
   sanctuario liba libamen sechar Jehovae.

   8. And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of
   the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a
   sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   8. Agnum autem alterum facies inter duas vesperas, secundum oblationem
   matutinam, et secundum libamen ejus facies oblationem ignitam, in
   odorem quietis Jehovae.

   9. And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and
   two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the
   drink-offering thereof:

   9. Die vero Sabbathi facies duos agnos anniculos immaculatos, et duas
   decimas ephi similae in minham permistae oleo, et libamen ejus.

   10. This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual
   burnt offering, and his drink offering.

   10. Istud est holocaustum Sabbathi, in Sabbatho suo ultra holocaustum
   juge in libamen ejus.

   11. And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
   offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of
   the first year without spot;

   11. Similiter in capitibus mensium vestrorum offeretis holocaustum
   Jehovae: juvencos filios bovis duos, et arietem unum, agnos anniculos
   immaculatos septem.

   12. And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with
   oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
   mingled with oil, for one ram;

   12. Et tres declinus epbi similae in minham permixtae oleo in juvencos
   singulos, et duas declinus ephi similae in minham permixtae oleo in
   singulos arietes.

   13. And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
   offering unto one lamb, for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a
   sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

   13. Et singulas decimas oblationem similae in minham permixtsa oleo, in
   singulos agnos, holocaustum odoris quietis, oblatio ignita Jehovae.

   14. And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
   bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of
   an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month
   throughout the months of the year.

   14. Haec autem libamina eorum e vino: dimidium hin etiam in singulos
   juvencos, et tertia pars hin in arietem, et quarta pars hin in singulos
   agnos. Hoc est holocaustum singulorum mensium per singulos menses anni.

   15. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be
   offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

   15. Et hircus caprarum unus in sacrificium pro peccato fiet Jehovae,
   procter holocaustum juge, et libamen ejus.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Moses, being about to speak again of
   the "continual" sacrifice, premises in general that the people should
   diligently follow in their offerings whatever God has enjoined; for by
   the word "observe," (custodiendi,) not only diligence, but obedience is
   also expressed. But, in order that they should more earnestly beware of
   every transgression, God calls either that which was wont daily to be
   placed on the table, or that which was annexed to the burnt-offerings,
   His bread, as if He ate of it after the manner of men. It is indeed a
   hard expression, but the rudeness of His ancient people obliged Him to
   speak thus grossly, that, on the one hand, they might learn this rite
   to be acceptable to God, just as food is acceptable to man; and, on the
   other, that they might study to offer their sacrifices more purely and
   chastely.

   3. And thou shalt say unto them. He repeats what we have seen in
   Exodus, that they should kill two lambs daily, one in the morning, and
   the other in the evening; but he speaks more fully of the concomitants
   of flour and wine, and also refers to the antiquity of this kind of
   sacrifice as its recommendation, because it began to be offered to God
   on Mount Sinai, and was a "savor of rest." [236] The libation of wine,
   of which mention is made, was also in use among heathen nations; but,
   inasmuch as it was without the command and promise of God, it could not
   but be unmeaning (insipidum ) [237] And it is probable (as we have seen
   elsewhere) that many of the heathen rites descended from the ancient
   fathers but as a false and empty imitation; for when they had forgotten
   the reason of them, all they did could only be a mere theatrical
   pageantry. But we have said that thus men were reminded always to have
   God before their eyes in their daily food; and therefore in every way
   to accustom themselves to cultivate holiness.

   9. And on the Sabbath-day. What was omitted in the former passage is
   here supplied, i.e., that on the Sabbath the continual sacrifice was to
   be doubled, and two lambs offered instead of one; for it was reasonable
   that, as the seventh day was peculiarly dedicated to God, it should be
   exalted above other days by some extraordinary and distinctive mark. He
   also commands greater sacrifices to be offered at the beginning of the
   month or new moon, viz., two bullocks and one ram, and a goat for a
   sin-offering; for we know that the first day of every month was
   consecrated to God, that the people might more frequently have the
   remembrance of their religious duties renewed; and the goat for an
   atonement for sin was added, in order that every month they should
   present themselves as guilty before God to deprecate His wrath.

   Numbers 28

   Numbers 28:16-31

   16. And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the
   LORD.

   16. Mense autem primo decima quarta die mensis, Pesah est Jehovae.

   17. And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days
   shall unleavened bread be eaten.

   17. Et in decimo quinto die mensis hujus solennitas: septem diebus
   panis infermentatorum comedetur.

   18. In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
   manner of servile work therein:

   18. Die primo convocatio sancta erit: omne servile non facietis.

   19. But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering
   unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the
   first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

   19. Offeretis autem oblationem ignitam, et holocaustum Jehovae juvencos
   fihos bovis duos, et arietem unum, et septem agnos anniculos:
   immaculati erunt vobis.

   20. And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three
   tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
   ram;

   20. Et minha eorum erit simila permixta oleo, tres decimae in singulos
   juvencos, et duas decimas in singulos arietes facietis.

   21. A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout
   the seven lambs:

   21. Singulas decimas facies in agnos singulos in septem agnis.

   22. And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

   22. Et hircum in sacrificium pro peccato unum, ad expiandum vos.

   23. Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
   which is for a continual burnt offering.

   23. Praeter holocaustum matutinum: quod est holocaustum juge, facietis
   ista.

   24. After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days,
   the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
   LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his
   drink offering.

   24. Secundum haec facietis singulis diebus septem dierum, panem
   oblationis ignitae odoris quietis Jehovae: ultra holocaustum juge fiet,
   et libamen ejus.

   25. And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall
   do no servile work.

   25. Septimo autem die convocatio sancta erit vobis: omne opus servile
   non facietis.

   26. Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
   offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy
   convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

   26. Porro die primitiarum quando offeretis minham novato Jehovae in
   hebdomadibus vestris, convocatio sancta erit vobis: omne opus servile
   non facietis.

   27. But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the
   LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;

   27. Et offeretis holocaustum in odorem quietis Jehovah: juvencos filios
   bovis duos, arietem unum, et septem agnos anniculos.

   28. And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
   deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

   28. Et oblationem eorum similam permixtam oleo, tres decimas in
   singulos juvencos, duas decimas per arietes singulos.

   29. A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;

   29. Singulas decimas per agnos singulos, septem agnis.

   30. And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

   30. Hircum caprarum unum ad expiandum vos.

   31. Ye shall offer them beside the burnt offering, and his meat
   offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink
   offerings.

   31. Praeter holocaustum juge et minham ejus facietis: immaculati erunt
   vobis et libamina eorum.


   16. And in the fourteenth day. It is true that the instruction here
   given has some connection with the feast of the passover, but since the
   sacrifices are avowedly treated of, and no mention is made of its other
   observances, except in this place, I have connected it with the
   continual sacrifice, as its concomitant or part. Moses cursorily
   refers, indeed, to what we have already seen, i.e., that the people
   should abstain from leaven for seven days, and eat unleavened bread;
   but he afterwards descends to the main point of which he here proposed
   to treat, viz., that the people should slay two bullocks as a
   burnt-offering, a ram, and seven lambs, together with a goat for a
   sin-offering; and that this sacrifice should be repeated through the
   whole week. In order, then, that the reverence paid to the passover
   should be increased, this extraordinary sacrifice was added to the
   continual one, partly that they might thus be more and more stimulated
   to devote themselves to God; partly that they might acknowledge how
   familiarly He had embraced them with His favor, inasmuch as He took
   these offerings from their flocks and herds, and required the sacred
   feast to be prepared for Him out of their cellars and granaries also;
   partly, too, that professing themselves to be worthy of eternal death,
   they should fly to Him to ask for pardon, and at the same time should
   understand that there was but one way of reconciliation, i.e., when God
   should be propitiated by sacrifice.

   26. Also in the day of thefirst-fruits. Moses delivers the same
   commandment as to another festival, viz., that on which they offered
   their first-fruits. Then, also, he instructs them, the continual
   sacrifice was to be increased by the addition of two bullocks, one ram,
   seven lambs, a goat for a sin-offering, together with the minha and a
   libation, with the object, of which I have already spoken. A perplexing
   difficulty here arises, because in Leviticus 23, one bullock is
   mentioned instead of two, and, on the contrary, two rams instead of
   one. [238] Some think that an option was left to the priests in this
   matter; but when I consider how precisely God's commands were given in
   everything, I question whether such an alternative was left to their
   discretion. The notion that God had once been content with a single
   bullock, as some think, because they were not abundant in the desert,
   appears to me a subterfuge. I confess I do not know how to get out of
   this difficulty, unless perhaps we say, that inasmuch as sufficiently
   exact provision had been made, in all other particulars, that nothing
   should be done without reason, in this respect only they were reminded
   that God in Himself cares not for greater or less victims. Nor does any
   reverence prevent us from saying that, as it sometimes happens in minor
   matters, a wrong number may have crept in from the carelessness of
   scribes; [239] and this is probably the most natural solution. The more
   correct reading, in my opinion, is, that they should offer two bullocks
   and one ram; but since it is elsewhere explained why God appointed this
   day, he only briefly recites here: "When they bring the fainha with the
   first-fruits."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] "Josephus and Maimonides understand that they were distinct
   sacrifices. Aben-Ezra and others think that it was left to the priest
   which he would offer." -- Brightwell on the Pentateuch, in loco.

   [239] The conjecture of C. receives no support from the modern
   collections of various readings; for though the number two is wanting
   in one of Kennicott's MSS., the word for bullocks is in the plural in
   that same MS.; and the two most ancient versions, viz., the LXX. and
   the Syriac agree with the received text both here and in Leviticus
   23:8. -- W.

   convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast
   unto the LORD seven days:

   juvencos filios bovis tredecim, arietes duos, agnos anniculos
   quatuordecim: immaculati erunt.

   14. And their meat-offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three
   tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth
   deals to each ram of the two rams,

   16. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual

   17. And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two

   agnos secundum numerum eorum, juxta morem.

   19. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, beside the continual

   20. And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of
   the first year without blemish;

   22. Et hircum in sacrificium pro petcato unum, praeter holocaustum
   juge, et minham ejus, et libamen ejus.

   23. And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of
   the first year without blemish:

   23. Die autem quarto juvencos decem, arietes duos, agnos anniculos

   35. On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no
   servile work therein:

   35. Die octavo solennitas erit vobis: nullum opus servile facietis.

   36. But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a
   sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the
   first year without blemish:

   36. Et offeretis holocaustum, et oblationem ignitam odoris quietis
   jehovae, juvencum unum, arietem unum, agnos anniculos septem

   38. Et hircum in sacrificium pro peccato unum: procter holocaustum

   39. These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside
   your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and
   for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your
   peace offerings.

   39. Ista facietis Jehovae in solemnitatibus vestris: prater vota
   vestra, et spontanea vestra in holocaustis vestris, et minhis vestris,
   et libaminibus vestris, et sacrificiis prosperitatum.


   1 And in the seventh month. I have already observed that the festivals
   are not here (generally) treated of, but only the sacrifices, by which
   their solemnization was to be graced. In the beginning of the seventh
   month was the memorial, as it was called, of the blowing of trumpets.
   Because it was a minor festival, Moses only commands one bullock to be
   killed; but the number was increased on other grounds, for we have
   already seen that on the first of every month two bullocks were
   sacrificed. This day, therefore, had three larger victims, whilst the
   number of the others was doubled, so that there were two rams and
   fourteen lambs. Thus, then, God consecrated this day doubly to Himself,
   so that one celebration diminished nothing of the other; else He might
   have seemed to have abrogated what He had once commanded. The memorial
   of trumpets was not, then, an abolition of the new-moon, but they kept
   both ordinances at the same time.

   7. And ye shall have on the tenth day. This was the day of Atonement.
   For although they never came into God's presence without supplication
   for pardon, they then in a special manner confessed their sins, because
   a fast was appointed in token of their guilt. For thus it is written in
   Leviticus 23:29,

   "Whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he
   shall be cut off from among his people."

   As to the sacrifices, one bullock only is required; the rest is as
   before, except that an exception is added, which was omitted in the
   former cases. For another propitiation is appointed besides the goat,
   to accord with the fact of their affliction. For the acknowledgment of
   guilt would have been a dreadful torment to their consciences without
   the hope of reconciliation. The reason of this sacrifice will be soon
   explained.

   12. And on the fifteenth, day. Amongst their festivals this last was
   the chief [240] in which they dwelt in tabernacles for seven days; for
   whereas in the Passover they commemorated the night in which they came
   forth free from the plagues of Egypt, by dwelling in tabernacles they
   embraced the whole forty years in which their fathers in the desert
   experienced the constant and consummate bounty of God. That solemn
   convention, too, availed for another present purpose, i.e., of
   thanksgiving to God for the ingathering of the harvest. Hence it was
   that they offered sacrifices every day and in greater number: on the
   first day, thirteen bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs; on the
   second, twelve bullocks; on the third, eleven; on the fourth, ten; on
   the fifth, nine; on the sixth, eight; finally, on the seventh, seven;
   and on the eighth, one. Nor is it carelessly that Moses expends so many
   words on the recital; first, that nothing might be done except at God's
   command; secondly, lest it should be disagreeable or onerous to be at
   such great expense, which they would have gladly avoided. Wherefore,
   that they might cheerfully obey God's command, he diligently inculcates
   what victims God would have daily offered to Him. But why the
   distribution was so unequal, I confess, is not clear to me, and it is
   better to confess my ignorance than by too subtle speculations to
   vanish into mere smoke. [241] This notion, indeed, is neither curious
   nor to be rejected, i.e., that, by daily diminishing the number, they
   came at last on the seventh day to the number seven, which is the
   symbol of perfection; for the eighth was superadded, merely as a
   conclusion. Finally, Moses subjoins that in the continual sacrifice, as
   well as these extraordinary ones, they should hold fast to what God
   prescribes, so that nothing should be altered according to man's fancy.
   The sacrifices which depend on the Commandments of the Second Table, I
   have designedly postponed to their proper place.

   [240] "La plus authentique." -- Fr.

   [241] Scott's conjecture is not without force: "The decrease of the
   number of the bullocks which were sacrificed on the several days of the
   feast, until on the last and great day only one was offered, is the
   most observable circumstance in this law. The reason is not evident,
   unless it be intimated that the Mosaic institution would gradually wax
   old, and at length vanish away when the promised Messiah came. (Hebrews
   8:7-13.)" As a specimen of the ancient opinions, I subjoin the
   following, -- "The Hebrews say that the offerings were made for other
   nations; and, therefore, seventy calves were offered altogether,
   according to the number of the seventy nations, divided into seventy
   languages. But fourteen calves were offered on the first day, and on
   the second day thirteen, thus decreasing one every day to the last
   inclusive; by which is designated that the dominion of the Gentiles was
   to be diminished and terminated under King Messiah, to whom all nations
   are to be subdued," etc. -- De Lyra, in loco.

   Leviticus 16

   Leviticus 16:1-34

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
   Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

   1. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen postquam mortui sunt duo ex
   filiis Aharon: qui dum accederent coram Jehova mortui sunt.

   2. And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he
   come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the
   mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear
   in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

   2. Dixitque Jellova ad Mosen, Loquere ad Aharon fratrem tuum, ut ne
   ingrediatnr omni tempore sanctuarium intra velum coram propitiatorio
   quod est supra arcata, ne moriatur: in nube enim apparebo supra
   propitiatorium.

   3. Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for
   a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

   3. Cum hoc ingredietur Aharon sanctuarium, eum juvenco filio bovis in
   hostiam pro peccato, et ariete in holocaustum.

   4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
   breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and
   with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;
   therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

   4. Tunica linca saneta induet se, et femoralia linea erunt super carnem
   ejus, balteoque lineo accinget se, et mitra linea velabit sese: vestes
   sanctitatis sunt: lavabitque aqua carnem suam, et induct se illis.

   5. And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two
   kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

   5. A coetu autem filiorum Israel accipiet duos hircos caprarum in
   hostiam pro peccato, et arietem unum in holocaustum.

   6. And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is for
   himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

   6. Offeretque Aharon juvencum sacrificii pro peccato suum, et
   expiationem faciet pro se et pro domo sua.

   7. And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   7. Postea caplet duos hircum, quos statuet coram Jehova ad ostium
   tabernaculi conventionis.

   8. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD,
   and the other lot for the scapegoat.

   8. Mittetque Aharon super duos illos hircum sortes, sortem unam
   Jehovae, et sortem alteram pro azazel.

   9. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and
   offer him for a sin offering.

   9. Offeret autem Aharon hircum super quem ceciderit sots pro Jehovae,
   et faciet eum pro peccato.

   10. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
   presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to
   let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

   10. Hircum vero super quem ceciderit sors pro azazel, statuet vivum
   coram Jehova ad emundandum per illum, ad emittendum illum in azazel in
   desertum.

   11. And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for
   himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
   and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:

   11. Offeret autem Aharon juvencum pro hostia peccati suum, et
   expiationem faciet pro se et pro domo sua, mactabitque juvencum pro
   hostia peccati suum.

   12. And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off
   the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten
   small, and bring it within the vail:

   12. Assumet quoque plenum thuribulum prunis ignitis de altari a
   conspectu Jehovae, et plenas volas suas de incenso aromatico comminuto,
   et inferet intra velum.

   13. And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that
   the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the
   testimony, that he die not:

   13. Ponetque incensum super ignero coram Jehova: operietque nubes
   incensi propitiatorium quod est super testimonium, et non morietur.

   14. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with
   his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
   shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

   14. Deinde accipiet de sanguine juvenei, et asperget digito suo contra
   faciem propitiatorii ad orientem: coram propitiatorio inquam asperget
   septem vicibus de sanguine illo, digito suo.

   15. Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
   people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as
   he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
   seat, and before the mercy seat:

   15. Mactabit praeterea hircum hostiam pro petcato, qui fuerit populi,
   et inferet sanguinem ejus intra velum: facietque de sanguine ejus
   quemadmodum fecit de sanguine juvenci, aspergens scilicet illum supra
   propitiatorium, et coram propitiatorio.

   16. And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
   uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their
   transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle
   of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their
   uncleanness.

   16. Et emundabit sanctuarium ab immunditiis filiorum Israel, eta
   praevaricationibus eorum, cunctisque pectaris eorum: sic quoque faciet
   tabernaculo conventionis quod moratur cum eis in medio immunditiarum
   corum.

   17. And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
   when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come
   out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and
   for all the congregation of Israel.

   17. Nullus autem homo erit in tabernaculo conventionis dum egredietur
   ipse ad emundandum in sanctuario, donec egrediatur ipse: et expiationem
   fecerit pro se et pro domo sua, et pro universo coetu Israel.

   18. And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and
   make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,
   and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar
   round about.

   18. Exibit autem ad altare quod est coram Jehova: et expiabit illud:
   tolletque de sanguine juvenci, ac de sanguine hirci, et ponet super
   cornua altaris per circuitum.

   19. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
   times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
   children of Israel.

   19. Aspergetque super illud de sanguine illo, digito suo, septem
   vicibus, ac mundabit illud, sanctificabitque ab immunditiis filiorum
   Israel.

   20. And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the
   tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live
   goat:

   20. Qunm autem finierit expiare sanctuarium tabernaculumque
   conventionis et altare, tune offeret hircum vivum.

   21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat,
   and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
   all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head
   of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
   wilderness:

   21. Imponetque Aharon ambas manus suas super caput hirei vivi, et
   confitebitur super illud onmes iniquitates filiorum Israel, et omnes
   praevaricationes eorum cum omnibus peccatis eorum: et ponet illa super
   caput hirci, ac emitter ilium per manum viri praeparati in desertum.

   22. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land
   not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

   22. Et portabit hircus ille super se omnes iniquitates eorum in terram
   inhabitabilem: et abire sinet hircum ilium in deserto.

   23. And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
   shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the
   holy place, and shall leave them there:

   23. Veniet post haec Aharon in tabernaculmunconventionis, et exuet se
   vestibus lineis, quibus induerat se dum ingrederetur sanctuarium, et
   ponet eas ibi.

   24. And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put
   on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the
   burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and
   for the people.

   24. Lavabitque carnem suam aqua in loco sancto: et induct se vestibus
   suis: egredietur autem et faciet holocaustum populi, et expiationem
   faciet pro se et pro populo.

   25. And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

   25. Adipem vero hostira pro peccato adolebit super altare.

   26. And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
   clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
   camp.

   26. Qui veto deduxerit hircum in azazel, lavabit vestimenta sua, postea
   quam laverit carnem suam aqua, et postea ingredietur castra ipsa.

   27. And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
   offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
   place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in
   the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

   27. Juvencum autem pro peccato, et hircum pro delicto quorum illatus
   fuerit sanguis ad emundandum in sanctuario, educet extra castra, et
   comburent igni pellem eorum, et carnes eorum, et fimum eorum.

   28. And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
   flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

   28. Et qui combusserit ea, lavabit, vestimenta sua, postquam laverit
   carnem suam aqua, et postea ingredietur castra.

   29. And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh
   month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and
   do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger
   that sojourneth among you:

   29. Eritque vobis in statutum perpetuum: mense septimo decima die
   mensis affligetis animas vestras: neque opus ullum facietis, indigena
   et peregrinus qui peregrinatur in medio vestri.

   30. For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
   cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.

   30. In hac enim die expiabit vos ut emundet vos ab omnibus peccatis
   vestris, coram Jehova mundabimini.

   31. It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your
   souls, by a statute for ever.

   31. Sabbathum quietis est vobis, et affligetis animas vestras statuto
   perpetuo.

   32. And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate
   to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make
   the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy
   garments:

   32. Expiabit enim sacerdos quem unxerit ungens, et cujus consecraverit
   manum ad fungendum sacrificio pro patre suo, inductque se vestibus
   lineis, vestibus sanctis.

   33. And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall
   make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the
   altar; and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the
   people of the congregation.

   33. Et expiabit sanctuarium sanctitatis et tabernaculum conventionis,
   altare quoqne expiabit et sacerdotes, et cunctum populum congregationis
   expiabit.

   34. And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
   atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.
   And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

   34. Eritque hoe vobis in statutum perpetuum, ad emundandum filios
   Israel ab omnibus peccatis suis, semel quotannis. Et fecit Moses
   secundum quod praeceperat ei Jehova.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. A copious description is here given
   of what we have recently adverted to cursorily, as it were, i.e., the
   solemn atonement which was yearly made in the seventh month; for when
   Moses was instructing them as to what sacrifices were to be offered on
   each of the festivals, he expressly excepted, though only in a single
   word, this sacrifice, where he spoke of the day of atonement itself, on
   which they afflicted their souls. Now, therefore, a clear and distinct
   exposition of it is separately given. For although at other seasons of
   the year also both their public and private sins were expiated, and for
   this purpose availed the daily sacrifices, still this more solemn rite
   was meant to arouse the people's minds, that they might more earnestly
   apply themselves all the year through to the diligent seeking for
   pardon and remission. In order, then, that they might be more anxious
   to propitiate God, one atonement was performed at the end of the year
   which might ratify all the others. But, that they might more diligently
   observe what is commanded, Moses makes mention of the time in which the
   Law was given, viz., when Nadab and Abihu were put to death by God,
   after they had rashly defiled the altar by their negligence.

   2. Speak unto Aaron. The sum of the law is, that the priest should not
   frequently enter the inner sanctuary, but only once a year, i.e., on
   the feast of the atonement, in the month of September. The cause of
   this was, lest a more frequent entrance of it should produce
   indifference; for if he had entered it promiscuously at every
   sacrifice, no small part of the reverence due to it would have been
   lost. The ordinary sprinkling of the altar was sufficient to testify
   the reconciliation; but this annual ceremony more greatly influenced
   the people's minds. Again, by this sacrifice, which they saw only once
   at the end of the year, the one and perpetual sacrifice offered by
   God's Son was more clearly represented. Therefore the Apostle elegantly
   alludes to this ceremony in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is
   said that by the annual entrance of the high priest the Holy Ghost
   signified,

   "that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while
   as the first tabernacle was yet standing,"
   (Hebrews 9:8;)

   and a little further on he adds, that after Christ the true Priest had
   come,

   "he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
   redemption for us." (Hebrews 9:11, 12.)

   Thus the year, in the ancient type, was a symbol of the one offering,
   so that believers might understand that the sacrifice, whereby God was
   to be propitiated, was not to be often repeated. That God may inspire
   greater fear, and preserve the priests from carelessness, He proclaims
   that His glory should appear in the cloud in that part of the sanctuary
   where was the mercy seat; for we know that the sign was given from
   hence to the Israelites, when the camp was to be moved, or when they
   were to remain stationary. But this testimony of God's presence should
   have justly moved the priests to greater care and attention; and hence
   we may now learn, that the closer God's majesty manifests itself, the
   more anxiously should we beware, lest through our thoughtlessness we
   should give any mark of contempt, but that we should testify our
   submission with becoming humility and modesty.

   3. Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place. The rites and formality
   are now described; first, that Aaron should put on the holy garments,
   and wash his person; secondly, that he should offer a bullock and ram
   for a burnt-offering; thirdly, that he should take two goats from the
   people, one of which should be sent away alive, and the other slain in
   sacrifice. We have stated elsewhere why the priests were to be dressed
   in garments different from others, since he who is the mediator between
   God and men should be free from all impurity and stain; and since no
   mortal could truly supply this, a type was substituted in place of the
   reality, from whence believers might learn that another Mediator was to
   be expected; because the dignity of the sons of Aaron was only typical,
   and not true and substantial. For whenever the priest stripped himself
   of his own garments, and assumed those which were holy and separated
   from common use, it was equivalent to declaring openly that he
   represented another person. But if this symbol were not sufficient, the
   ablution again taught that none of the sons of Aaron was the genuine
   propitiator; for how could he purify others, who himself required
   purification, and made open confession of his uncleanness? A third
   symbol also was added; for he who by a sacrifice of his own atoned for
   himself and his house, how was he capable of meriting God's favor for
   others? Thus then the holy fathers were reminded, that under the image
   of a mortal man, another Mediator was promised, who, for the
   reconciliation of the human race, should present Himself before God
   with perfect and more than angelical purity. Besides, in the person of
   the priest there was exhibited to the people a spectacle of the
   corruption whereby the whole human race is defiled, so as to be
   abominable to God; for if the priest, both chosen by God, and graced
   with the sacred unction, was still unworthy on the score of his
   uncleanness to come near the altar, what dignity could be discoverable
   in the people? And hence to us now-a-days also very useful instruction
   is derived; viz., that when the question arises how God is to be
   propitiated, we are not to look this way and that way; since out of
   Christ there is no purity and innocence which can satisfy the justice
   of God.

   7. And he shall take the two goats. A twofold mode of expiation is here
   presented to us; for one of the two goats was offered in sacrifice
   according to the provisions of the Law, the other was sent away to be
   an outcast, or offscouring (katharma vel peripsema [242] ) The
   fulfillment of both figures, however, was manifested in Christ, since
   He was both the Lamb of God, whose offering blotted out the sins of the
   world, and, that He might be as an offscouring, (katharma,) His
   comeliness was destroyed, and He was rejected of men. A more subtle
   speculation might indeed be advanced, viz., that after the goat was
   presented, its sending away was a type of the resurrection of Christ;
   as if the slaying of the one goat testified that the satisfaction for
   sins was to be sought in the death of Christ; whilst the preservation
   and dismissal of the other shewed, that after Christ had been offered
   for sin, and had borne the curse of men, He still remained alive. I
   embrace, however, what is more simple and certain, and am satisfied
   with that; i.e., that the goat which departed alive and free, was an
   atonement, [243] that by its departure and flight the people might be
   assured that their sins were put away and vanished. This was the only
   expiatory sacrifice in the Law without blood; nor does this contradict
   the statement of the Apostle, for since two goats were offered
   together, it was enough that the death of one should take place, and
   that its blood should be shed for expiation; for the lot was not cast
   until both goats had been brought to the door of the tabernacle; and
   thus although the priest presented one of them alive "to make an
   atonement with him," as Moses expressly says, yet God was not
   propitiated without blood, since the efficacy of the expiation depended
   on the sacrifice of the other goat. As to the word Azazel, [244]
   although commentators differ, I doubt not but that it designates the
   place to which the scape-goat was driven. It is certainly a compound
   word, equivalent to "the departure of the goat," which the Greeks have
   translated, whether properly or not I cannot say, apopompaion I am
   afraid that the expiation is decidedly too subtle which some
   interpreters give, that the goat was so called as "the repeller of
   evils," just as the Gentiles [245] invented certain gods, called
   alexikakous. What I have said agrees best with the departure of the
   goat; although I differ from the Jews, who conceive that this place was
   contiguous to Mount Sinai; as if the lot for Azazel were not cast every
   year, when the people were very far away from Mount Sinai. Let it
   suffice, then, that some solitary and most uninhabitable spot was
   chosen whither the goat should be driven, lest the curse of God should
   rest upon the people.

   12. And he shall take a censer full. Before he takes the blood into the
   sanctuary, (the priest) is commanded to offer incense. There was, as we
   have seen, an altar of incense, on which the priest burnt it, but
   without the veil; but now he is ordered to go within the veil, to make
   [246] an incense-offering in the very holy of holies. But it is worth
   noticing, that is said that the cloud of the incense should cover the
   mercy-seat -- that the priest die not; for by this sign it was shewn
   how formidable is God's majesty, the sight of which is fatal even to
   the priest; that all might learn to tremble at it, and to prostrate
   themselves as suppliants before Him; and again, that all audacity and
   temerity might be repressed. But it is uncertain whether he killed
   together the bullock for himself and the goat for the people, or
   whether, after he had sprinkled the sanctuary with his own offering, he
   killed the goat separately. Moses indeed seems to mark this distinct
   order in the words he uses; for after having spoken of the first
   sprinkling, he immediately adds, "Then shall he kill the goat of the
   sin-offering:" but since the narrative of Moses is not always
   consecutive, and it is a matter of little importance, let the reader
   choose which he pleases.

   16. And he shall make an atonement for the holy place. The cleansing of
   the sanctuary might seem absurd, as if it were in man's power to
   pollute what God Himself had consecrated; for we know that God remains
   true, although all' the world be unholy, and consequently that whatever
   God has appointed changes not its nature through the sins of men. Yet,
   if no contagion from men's sins had infected the tabernacle, this
   cleansing would have been superfluous. But although the sanctuary in
   itself may have contracted no defilement from the guilt of the people,
   still, in regard to the sin and guilt of the people themselves, it is
   justly accounted unclean. And thus sin is made more exceeding sinful,
   inasmuch as men, even though their intention be to serve God, profane
   His sacred name, if they do so carelessly or irreverently. It was at
   that time a detestable sacrilege in all to defile the altar and
   sanctuary of God; and Moses convicts the Israelites of this sacrilege
   when He commands the sanctuary to be cleansed. Moreover, let us learn
   that men may so contaminate the sacred things of God as that their
   nature should still remain unaltered and their dignity inviolate.
   Wherefore Moses expressly states that the sanctuary is cleansed not
   from its own uncleanness, but from that of the children of Israel. We
   must now apply the substance of this type to our own use. By Baptism
   and the Lord's Supper, God appears to us in his only-begotten Son:
   these are the pledges of our holiness; yet such is our corruption that
   we never cease from profaning, as far as in us lies, these instruments
   of the Spirit whereby God sanctifies us. Since, however, we have now no
   victims to kill, we must mourn and humbly pray that Christ, by the
   sprinkling of His blood, may blot out and cleanse these defilements of
   ours, by which Baptism and the Lord's Supper are polluted. The reason
   of the purification is also to be observed, viz., because the
   tabernacle "dwelleth among them in the midst of their uncleanness;"
   [247] by which words Moses signifies that men are so polluted and full
   of corruptions that they contaminate all that is holy without the
   intervention of a means of purification; for he takes it for granted
   that men cannot but bring some impurity with them. What he had said of
   the inner sanctuary he extends to the altar and the whole of the
   tabernacle.

   17. And there shall be no man. The driving away of all men from
   approaching the tabernacle during the act of atonement is a sort of
   punishment by temporary banishment, that they may perceive themselves
   to be driven from God's face, whilst the place is purified which had
   been defiled by their sins. This was a melancholy sight, when all these
   for whose sake it was erected were obliged to desert it; but in this
   way they were reminded that every part and particle of our salvation
   depends on God's mercy only, when they saw themselves excluded from the
   remedy designed for obtaining pardon, unless a new pardon should come
   to their aid, since they had fallen away from the hope of
   reconciliation.

   20. And when he hath made an end of reconciling. The mode of expiation
   with the other goat is now more clearly explained, viz., that it should
   be placed before God, and that the priest should lay his hands on its
   head, and confess the sins of the people, so that he may throw the
   curse on the goat itself. This, as I have said, was the only bloodless
   (anaimaton) sacrifice; yet it is expressly called an "offering," [248]
   with reference, however, to the slaying of the former goat, and was,
   therefore, as to its efficacy for propitiation, by no means to be
   separated from it. It was by no means reasonable that an innocent
   animal should be substituted in the place of men, to be exposed to the
   curse of God, except that believers might learn that they were in no
   wise competent to bear His judgment, nor could be delivered from it
   otherwise than by the transfer of their guilt and crime. For, since men
   feel that they are altogether overwhelmed by the wrath of God, which
   impends over them all, they vainly endeavor to lighten or shake off in
   various ways this intolerable burden; for no absolution is to be hoped
   for save by the interposition of a satisfaction; and it is not lawful
   to obtrude this according to man's fancy, or, in their foolish
   arrogance, to seek in themselves for the price whereby their sins may
   be compensated for. Another means, therefore, of making atonement to
   God was revealed when Christ, "being made a curse for us," transferred
   to Himself the sins which alienated men from God. (2 Corinthians 5:19;
   Galatians 3:13.) The confession tended to humiliate the people, and
   thus acted as a stimulus to sincere repentance; since "the sacrifices
   of God are a broken spirit," (Psalm 51:17;) nor is it fit that any but
   the prostrate should be lifted up by God's mercy, nor that any but
   those who voluntarily condemn themselves should be absolved. The
   accumulation of words tends to this, "all the iniquities, all their
   transgressions, all their sins," that believers may not lightly only
   and as, a mere act of duty acknowledge themselves guilty before God,
   but rather that they should groan under the weight, of their guilt.
   Since now in Christ no special day in the year is prescribed in which
   the Church should confess its sins in a solemn ceremony, let believers
   learn, whenever they meet together in God's name, humbly to submit
   themselves to voluntary self-condemnation, and to pray for pardon, as
   if the Spirit of God dictated a formulary for them; and so let each in
   private: conform himself to this rule.

   26. And he that let the goat go. Since this goat was the outcast
   (kathapma) of God's wrath, and devoted to His curse, he who led it away
   is commanded to wash his person and his clothes, as if he were a
   partaker in its defilement. By this symbol the faithful were reminded
   how very detestable is their iniquity, so that they might, be affected
   with increasing dread, whenever they considered what they deserved. For
   when they saw a man forbidden to enter the camp because he was polluted
   by simply touching the goat, they must needs reflect how much wider was
   the alienation between God and themselves, when they bore upon them an
   uncleanness not contracted elsewhere, but procured by their own sin.
   The same may be said of him who burned the skin, the flesh, and the
   dung of the bullock and the goat. We have elsewhere seen that these
   remnants were carried out of the camp in token of abomination. And on
   this head Christ's inestimable love towards us shines more brightly,
   who did not disdain to go out of the city that He might be made an
   outcast (rejectamentum) for us, and might undergo the curse due to us.

   29. And this shall be a statute for ever. This day of public atonement
   is now finally mentioned in express terms, and the affliction of souls,
   of which fuller notice is taken in chap. 23, is touched upon, that they
   may more diligently exercise themselves in more serious penitential
   meditations, nor doubt that they are truly purged before God; and yet
   in a sacramental manner, viz., that the external ceremony might be a
   most unmistakable sign of that atonement, whereby, in the fullness of
   time, they were to be reconciled to God. Wherefore Moses states at some
   length that this was to be the peculiar office of the priest; and by
   this eulogy exalts the grace of the coming Mediator, so that He may
   direct the minds of believers to Him alone.

   Leviticus 1

   Leviticus 1:1-17

   1. And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

   1. Vocavit autem Mosen, et loquutus est Jehova cum eo e tabernaculo
   conventionis, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of
   you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of
   the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.

   2. Loquere ad filios Israel, et dic illis, Homo quum offeret ex vobis
   oblationem Jehovae: ex animalibus, ex bobus, et ex pecudibus offeretis
   oblationem.

   3. If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
   male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

   3. Si holocaustum oblatio ejus fuerit ex bobus, masculum immaculatum
   offeret: ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis offeret eum pro animi
   proposito in conspectu Jehovae.

   4. And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and
   it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

   4. Et admovebit manum suam super caput holocausti: et accepturm erit
   pro ipso ad eum expiandum.

   5. And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,
   Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about
   upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation.

   5. Mactabit autem juveneum in conspectu Jehovae, et offerent filii
   Aharon sacerdotes sanguinem, ae spargent illum in circiutu super altare
   quod erit ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   6. And be shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

   6. Et excoriabit holocaustum, concidetque in frusta sua.

   7. And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and
   lay the wood in order upon the fire:

   7. Ponentque filii Aharon sacerdotis ignem super altare, et disponent
   ligna super ignem.

   8. And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and
   the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the
   altar:

   8. Posthaec disponent filii Aharon sacerdotes frusta, caput, et adipem,
   super ligna superimposita igni qui est super altare.

   9. But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest
   shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made
   by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   9. Intestina autem ejus et crura lavabit aqua, et adolebit sacerdos
   omnia super altare: holocaustum est oblatio ignita odoris quietis
   Jehovae.

   10. And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of
   the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without
   blemish.

   10. Quod si de pecudibus fuerit oblatio ejus, de ovibus, vel de capris
   in holocaustum, masculum immaculatum offeret eum:

   11. And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the
   LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round
   about upon the altar.

   11. Mactabitque illud ad latus altaris ad aquilonem in conspectu
   Jehovae: spargentque filii Aharon sacerdotes sanguinem ejus super
   altare in circiutu.

   12. And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and
   the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
   which is upon the altar:

   12. Et concidet eum in frusta sun, et caput ejus, et adipem ejus:
   ordinabitque ea sacerdos super ligna superposita igni qui est super
   altare.

   13. But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
   priests shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt
   sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   13. Et intestina et crura lavabit aqua, efferetque sacerdos onmia,
   adolebitque super altare: holocaustum est, oblatio ignita odoris
   quietis Jehovae.

   14. And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
   fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young
   pigeons.

   14. Si autem de avibus fuerit holocaustum, oblatio ipsius Jehovae, tum
   offeret de turturibus aut de columbis oblationem suam.

   15. And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his
   head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung
   out at the side of the altar:

   15. Et offeret illam sacerdos super altare, et ungue secabit caput
   ipsius: et adolebit super altare, exprimeturque sanguis ejus super
   parietem altaris.

   16. And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it
   beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:

   16. Et removebit vesiculam ejus cum pluma ipsius: projicietque illam
   prope altare ad orientem ad locum cineris.

   17. And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide
   it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood
   that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
   fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   17. Et findet illam cum alis suis, neque dividet, adolebitque eam
   sacerdos super altare, super ligna qum fuerint super igne: holocaustum
   est oblatio ignita odoris quietis Jehovae.


   1. And the Lord called unto Moses. In these seven chapters Moses will
   treat generally of the sacrifices. But since we read of many things
   here, the use of which has passed away, and others, the grounds of
   which I do not understand, I intend to content myself with a brief
   summary, from whence, however, the reader may fully perceive that
   whatever has been left to us relative to the legal sacrifices is even
   now profitable, provided we are not too curious. Let those who choose
   to hunt for allegories receive the praise they covet; my object is only
   to profit my readers, and it will suffice briefly to sum up what I
   think useful to be known. Although in this chapter burnt-offerings only
   are treated of, yet the rule which is laid down respecting them has a
   more extensive application, since Moses teaches what animals God would
   have offered to Him, so as that they may be acceptable, and also by
   whom and with what ceremonies they are to be offered. He enumerates
   three kinds, of the herd, of the flocks, and of fowls; for the case of
   the red heifer, from which the ashes of atonement were made, was
   different and peculiar; and here the question is as to the ordinary
   sacrifices, by which private individuals used either to atone for their
   sins or to testify their piety. He commands, therefore, that the cattle
   as well as the lambs and kids should be males, and also perfect and
   free from all blemish. We see, then, that only clean animals were
   chosen for the sacrifices, and again that all clean animals did not
   please God, but only domestic ones, such as allow themselves to be
   directed by the hand and will of men. For, though deer and roes are
   sometimes tamed, yet God did not admit them to His altar. This, then,
   was the first rule of obedience, that men should not offer
   promiscuously this or that victim, but bulls or bull-calves of their
   herds, and male lambs or kids of their flocks. Freedom from blemish is
   required for two reasons; for, since the sacrifices were types of
   Christ, it behooved that in all of them should be represented that
   complete perfection of His whereby His heavenly Father was to be
   propitiated; and, secondly, the Israelites were reminded that all
   uncleanness was repudiated by God lest his service should be polluted
   by their impurity. But whilst God exhorted them to study true
   sincerity, so he abundantly taught them that unless they directed their
   faith to Christ, whatsoever came from them would be rejected; for
   neither would the purity of a brute animal have satisfied Him if it had
   not represented something better. In the second place, it is prescribed
   that whosoever presented a burnt-offering should lay his hand on its
   head, after he had come near the door of the tabernacle. This ceremony
   was not only a sign of consecration, but also of its being an
   atonement, [249] since it was substituted for the man, as is expressed
   in the words of Moses, "And it shall be accepted for him to make
   atonement for him." (Ver. 4.) There is not, then, the least doubt but
   that they transferred their guilt and whatever penalties they had
   deserved to the victims, in order that they might be reconciled to God.
   Now, since this promise could not have been at all delusive, it must be
   concluded that in the ancient sacrifices there was a price of
   satisfaction which should release them from guilt and blame in the
   judgment of God; yet still not as though these brute animals availed in
   themselves unto expiation, except in so far as they were testimonies of
   the grace to be manifested by Christ. Thus the ancients were reconciled
   to God in a sacramental manner by the victims, just as we are now
   cleansed through baptism. Hence it follows that these symbols were
   useful only as they were exercises unto faith and repentance, so that
   the sinner might learn to fear God's wrath, and to seek pardon in
   Christ.

   5. And he shall kill the bullock. The ceremony of killing is subjoined,
   viz., that the priest should prepare the victim itself, and pour its
   blood upon the altar, for it was not allowable for a private person to
   kill the victim with his own hands, but what the priest did in their
   name was transferred to them. [250] But this is worth remarking, that
   although they brought the pledge of reconciliation from their home, yet
   that the ministers of expiation were to be sought elsewhere, since no
   one was competent for so illustrious an office, save he who was graced
   by the holy unction of God. It was, therefore, plainly manifested that
   all mortals are unworthy of coming near God to propitiate Him, and that
   the hands of all are in a manner polluted or profane except those which
   God himself has purged. For the honor of sacrificing came from nowhere
   else but from the grace of the Spirit, of which the external anointing
   was a pledge. We now understand how it was that individuals offered
   sacrifices to God, and yet that the priest alone performed this office.
   The altar was sprinkled with the blood, that the people might know that
   the blood poured from the victim did not fall on the ground, but was
   consecrated to God, and breathed, as it were, a sweet savor; just as
   now the blood of Christ appears before His face. I pass by the rest,
   since it does not seem worth while to enlarge on the third kind of
   offering, i.e., of the birds. Yet we must recollect that thus far Moses
   only speaks of the burnt-offerings, whose flesh was burned; for this
   was not the case with all, as we shall see hereafter. Although, then,
   it is twice said that "the priests shall lay the parts, the head and
   the fat," etc., we must not understand it as if he only commanded the
   fat and the head to be burned, but that nothing was to be left the
   skin. Some think that phdr pheder, [251] is a dissevered head, nor do I
   reject their opinion, provided we do not exclude the fat. Whatever was
   filthy in the victim, God would have to be washed, that it might not
   contaminate it. The question now arises why it was burned either wholly
   or partially. My own opinion is, that by the fire the efficacy of the
   Spirit is represented, on which all the profit of the sacrifices
   depends; for unless Christ had suffered in the Spirit, He would not
   have been a propitiatory sacrifice. Fire, then, was as the condiment
   which gave their true savor to the sacrifices, because the blood of
   Christ was to be consecrated by the Spirit, that it might cleanse us
   from all the stains of our sins. This God would have more fully
   represented in the burnt-offerings, yet no victim was offered of which
   some part was not consumed by fire.

   [250] "It is interesting to notice here, (says Bonar, in loco,) that
   Outram, Witzius, and others, seem to have proved that in patriarchal
   ages every man might offer his own sacrifice. The patriarchal ages were
   taught that every man must take Christ for himself personally. In the
   Mosaic economy, however, this is altered; there is another truth to be
   shewn forth. Any one (2 Chronicles 30:17) might kill the animal -- any
   common Levite, or even the offerer himself -- for there may be many
   executioners of God's wrath. Earth and hell were used in executing the
   Father's purpose toward the Prince of Life. But there is only one
   appointed way for dispensing mercy, and therefore only priests must
   engage in that act that signified the bestowal of pardon." He appears,
   however, to be singular in his opinion that any but a Levite might kill
   the victim.

   [251] This word only occurs here, and in ver. 12, and chap. 8:20. S.M.
   says that the Jewish expositors declare it to mean that fat, or network
   of fat which is found upon the liver, and with which the severance
   (locus de-collationis) of the head was covered, when the head was put
   upon the fire. It is not easy to discover who may have said that it
   meant a dissevered head. -- W. "Some translate it (says Poole, in loco)
   the body, or the trunk of the body, (whence, perhaps, C.'s error.) So
   the ancient Hebrews quoted in Fagius; so Vatablus, Grotius, Malvenda,
   Mercerus in Bochart."

   Leviticus 2

   Leviticus 2:1-16

   1. And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering
   shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put
   frankincense thereon:

   1. Anima quum offeret oblationem minha Jehovae, simila erit oblatio
   ejus: fundetque super eam oleum, ac thus superimponet.

   2. And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take
   thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with
   all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of
   it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
   unto the LORD:

   2. Afferet autem eam ad filios Aharon sacerdotes, et accipiet inde
   plenum pugillum de simila ejus, et de oleo ipsius supra totum thus
   ipsius, adolebitque sacerdos odorem ejus super altare: oblatio ignita
   est odoris quietis Jehovae.

   3. And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons':
   it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

   3. Et residuum e minha, ipsius Aharon erit et filiorum ejus, sanctum
   sanctorum est ex oblationibus ignitis Jehovae.

   4. And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven,
   it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
   unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

   4. Quinn vero obtuleris oblationem minha, coctionem clibani, sit e
   simila placentae infermentatae mixtae oleo, et lagana ex infermentatis
   mixta oleo.

   5. And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be
   of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

   5. Si minha sartaginis erit oblatio tua, sit simila conspersa oleo
   infermentata.

   6. Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat
   offering.

   6. Concides eam in frusta, et fundes super cam oleum: minha est.

   7. And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it
   shall be made of fine flour with oil.

   7. Quod si minha craticulm erit oblatio tua, simila sit oleo conspersa.

   8. And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things
   unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring
   it unto the altar.

   8. Afferesque minham ex illis factam Jehovae: et offeres illam
   sacerdoti qui admovebit eam altari.

   9. And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof,
   and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a
   sweet savour unto the LORD.

   9. Tolletque sacerdos de minha odorem ejus, et adolebit super altare:
   oblatio est ignita odoris quietis Jehovae.

   10. And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and
   his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by
   fire.

   10. Et quod superfuerit e minha erit Aharon et filiorum ejus, sanctum
   sanctorum est ex oblationibus ignitis Jehovae.

   11.: No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
   made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any
   offering of the LORD made by fire.

   11. Omnis minha quam offeretis Jehovae non fiet fermentata: quia de
   nullo fermento, et de nullo melle adolebis oblationem ignitam Jehovae.

   12. As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
   the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

   12. In oblatione primitiarum offeretis ea Jehovae: et super altare non
   ascendent in odorem quietis.

   13. And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
   salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to
   be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt
   offer salt.

   13. Et omnem oblationem minhae tuae sale salies, neque cessare facies
   sal foederis Dei tui a minha tua: in omni oblatione tua offeres sal.

   14. And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD,
   thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of
   corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

   14. Si vero obtuleris minham primitiarum Jehovae, spicam tostam igni,
   triticum contusum spicae plenae offeres minham primitiarum tuarum.

   15. And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is
   a meat offering.

   15. Et pones super eam oleum, pones item thus super eam: minha est.

   16. And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
   corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
   thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

   16. Et adolebit sacerdos odorem ejus, de frumento ejus contuso et de
   oleo ejus ultra totum thus ipsius: oblatio est ignita Jehovah.


   1. And when any will offer. In this chapter Moses prescribes the rules
   for those offerings to which the name of minha is peculiarly given.
   They were not bloody sacrifices, nor offerings of animals, but only of
   cakes and oil. If any one would offer plain flour, he is commanded to
   season it with frankincense and oil, and also to choose fine flour,
   that the oblation may not be defiled by the bran. Thus here, as in all
   the service of God, the rule is laid down that nothing but what is pure
   should be offered; besides, by the oil its savor is improved, and by
   the frankincense a fragrant odor is imparted to it. We know that God is
   not attracted either by sweetness of taste nor by pleasant scents; but
   it was useful to teach a rude people by these symbols, lest they should
   corrupt God's service by their own foolish inventions. Moses afterwards
   commands, that whatever is consecrated to God should be delivered into
   the hand of the priest, as we have before seen that private persons
   were excluded from this honor so that Christ's peculiar dignity should
   remain to Him, i.e., that by Him alone access should be sought to God,
   and that all men might know that no worship pleases God except what He
   sanctifies. The substance of this type is shewn by the words of the
   Apostle, when he says that "by him" we now "offer the sacrifice of
   praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks
   to His name." (Hebrews 13:15.) But when the priest had burnt a handful
   of the flour with the oil and frankincense, what remained was left for
   his own use; for, as we have elsewhere seen, the holy of holies of the
   burnt-offerings were given to the priests. Other kinds are then spoken
   of, viz., cakes, baken in the oven; then such as were fried in a pan;
   and thirdly, on a gridiron: for God would have the minha offered Him of
   every kind of cake, so that the Israelites might learn to look to Him
   in all their food, since nothing is clean to us except what He
   consecrates by His blessing. This is the reason why Moses accurately
   distinguishes between the cakes which were cooked either in the oven,
   or the frying-pan, or on the gridiron.

   11. No meat-offering, which ye shall bring. God here forbids leavened
   cakes to be offered to Him, by which rite the ancients were taught that
   God's service is corrupted if any strange invention be mingled with it.
   Nor can it be doubted but that. Christ alluded to this when He warned
   His disciples to "beware of the leaven of the Pharisees," (Matthew
   16:11;) understanding by that word the fictions whereby they had
   corrupted religion. The eating of leaven was forbidden in the Passover
   for another reason, viz., that they might remember their sudden
   departure, or rather flight, in which there had been no time to prepare
   provisions for their journey. Although Paul extends it even further,
   viz., that believers should abstain from all "leaven of malice and
   wickedness." (1 Corinthians 5:8.) It is clear, however, that in this
   general rule all adventitious corruptions are condemned, whereby pure
   religion is polluted, as if it were said that no offerings would be
   approved by God except such as were genuine and free from all strange
   savor. With reference to the honey, the ground of its use is more
   obscure, for I know not whether there is much dependence to be placed
   on the subtle disquisitions of some respecting its nature. [252] But
   although I scarcely dare to make any assertion as to this, still I pass
   by conceits, and advance what seems to me more probable. Cooked honey
   immediately becomes sour, and causes the bread with which it is mixed
   to ferment; these two things, therefore, seem to be combined, that
   neither honey nor leaven should be offered in the fire. As to what
   Moses adds just afterwards, "Ye shall offer them among the
   first-fruits," I know not whether it applies to the leaven, as some
   think; assuredly the exception seems to be more simple, that the
   first-fruits of honey would indeed be acceptable to God, provided it
   did not corrupt the offerings of the altar. But no doubt the ancients
   understood the meaning of this precept, else it would have been
   useless, and thus knew that nothing was legitimate in the sacrifices
   except what God appointed. But let us, since the use of the ceremony is
   abolished, learn not to intrude our own imaginations or inventions in
   God's service, but to follow obediently the rule which he prescribes.

   13. And every oblation of thy meat-offering. The reason for salting the
   victims was very similar, viz., that God's service might not be without
   savor; but the true seasoning which gives grace to sacrifices is found
   nowhere except in God's word. Hence it follows that all modes of
   worship fabricated by men are rejected as unsavory. For although they
   who profane God's worship by superstitions think themselves very acute,
   yet all that most approves itself to them under the cloak of wisdom is
   mere fatuity. Nevertheless, Christ deduces an exhortation from this
   ceremony, viz., that believers, if they desire to please God, should
   patiently endure to be refined and purified. "Every one," He says,

   "shall be salted with fire,
   and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt." (Mark 9:49.)

   In which words He signifies that, when we are searched and tried by
   fire, we shall be acceptable sacrifices to God, and that this is the
   seasoning of salt when our flesh with its affections shall have been
   well macerated. Meanwhile, let us firmly hold to this, that our service
   of God is not what it should be without, the savor which is to be
   sought in the word; since in all the brains of men not one particle of
   salt is to be found. I pass by other more subtle allegories, in which I
   see no other use than to gratify curious ears. "The salt of the
   covenant" is used in a different sense from "the covenant of salt,"
   viz., as the salt which is employed in the sacrifice according to the
   inviolable compact of God. Hence, too, is confirmed what I have said
   before, that the keeping of God's covenant always occupies the first
   place in this service.

   14. And if thou offer a meat-offering. This offering is different from
   that of the first-fruits, since it was voluntary, whereas the
   first-fruits were paid in obedience to the enactment of the Law. But if
   any one chose to add anything to the first-fruits of his new corn,
   Moses lays down the rule, that the ears should be dried in the fire, so
   that they might be more easily pounded, and so might be burnt mixed
   with oil and frankincense; for so I interpret his words, that he means
   the same thing by "ears of corn dried by the fire," and "corn beaten
   out of full ears." He requires full ears, that the people may select
   them, and not offer anything poor or stunted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [252] They appear, indeed, to have been manifold. "R. Salomon (says
   Corn. a Lapide, in loco) understands by honey, sweet fruits, such as
   figs and dates. Philo, lib. de Vict., thinks that honey was forbidden
   in the sacrifices, because the bee is an impure animal, generated by
   the putrid carcases of oxen." Oleaster gives as a reason that honey
   burns with an offensive smell; and many commentators, because it was
   constantly offered in the Gentile sacrifices.

   Leviticus 3

   Leviticus 3:1-17

   1. And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it
   of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without
   blemish before the LORD.

   1. Quod si sacrificium prosperitatum fuerit oblatio ejus, si de bobus
   ipse offeret, sire masculum, sive foeminam offerat, immaculatum offeret
   eum in conspectu Jehovae.

   2. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
   at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the
   priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

   2. Et imponet manum suam super caput oblationis suae, et immolabit eum
   ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis: fundentque filii Aharon sacerdotes
   sanguinem super altare per circuitum.

   3. And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
   offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards,
   and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

   3. Postea offeret de sacrificio prosperitatum oblationem ignitam
   Jehovae, adipem operientem intestina, et omnem adipem qui est super
   ilia.

   4. And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   4. Et duos renes, adipemque qui est super ipsos, qui est super ilia, et
   fibram cum jecore, cum renibus removebit.

   5. And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
   sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an
   offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   5. Adolebunt autem omne illud filii Aharon super altare, una cum
   holocausto quod erit super ligna superposita igni: oblatio ignita est
   odoris quietis Jehovae.

   6. And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD
   be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.

   6. Quod si de pecudibus fuerit oblatio ejus, in sacrificium
   prosperitatum Jehovae, masculum aut foeminam immaculatum offeret eum:

   7. If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before
   the LORD.

   7. Si vero agnum offerat oblationem suam, tum offeret illum in
   conspectu Jehovae:

   8. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
   before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall
   sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

   8. Imponentque manum suam super caput oblationis sum, postea mactabit
   eum in conspectu tabernaculi conventionis: spargent filii Aharon
   sanguinem ejus, super altare per circuitum.

   9. And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
   offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole
   rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that
   covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

   9. Et offeret de sacrificio prosperitatum oblationem ignitam Jehovae,
   adipem ejus, caudam integrare, e regione spinae dorsi removebit eam,
   adipem quoque operientem intestina, atque omnem adipem qui est super
   ilia.

   10. And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   10. Et duos renes: et adipem qui est super illos, et qui est super
   ilia, et fibram qum est super jecur, cum renibus removebit.

   11. And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the
   offering made by fire unto the LORD.

   11. Adolebitque illud sacerdos super altare, cibus oblationis ignitm
   est jehovae.

   12. And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
   LORD.

   12. Si vero capra fuerit oblatio ejus, tum offeret eam in conspectu
   Jehovae.

   13. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before
   the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall
   sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

   13. Ponetque manum snare super caput ejus, et maetabit eam coram
   tabernaculo conventionis, et spargent filii Aharon sanguinem ejus super
   altare per circuitum.

   14. And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by
   fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
   that is upon the inwards,

   14. Postea offeret ex ea oblationem suam, oblationem ignitam Jehovae,
   adipem operientem intestina: et omnem adipem qui est super ilia.

   15. And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   15. Et duos renes, et adipem qui est super illos: et qui est super
   ilia, et fibram qum est super jecur: eum renibus removebit.

   16. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of
   the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the
   LORD'S.

   16. Adolebitque eam sacerdos super altare, eibus oblationis ignitm est
   odoris quietis: et omnis adeps Jehovae est.

   17. It shall be aperpetual statute for your generations throughout all
   your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

   17. Statutum perpetuum in generationibus vestris, in cunetis
   habitaculis vestris: omnem adipem et omnem sanguinem non comedetis.


   1. And if his oblation be a sacrifice. He now proceeds to a different
   class, viz., to the sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude in
   celebration of God's blessings; part of which was burnt with fire, part
   was claimed by the priests, and the rest remained to the offerers
   themselves. As to the word slmym, shelomim, I have briefly given my
   opinion elsewhere; [253] the common translation of it is certainly
   unsuitable, "the sacrifices of peace-offerings:" and the statement of
   others is far-fetched, that they are called "sacrifices of
   perfections," because it was unlawful for the unclean to touch them.
   Since, however, the Hebrews include in the word "peace," safety, and
   all good success, I have thought that its plural number might aptly be
   translated "prosperities:" on which account, David calls the libation
   which used to be made in this sacrifice, "the cup of salvations:"
   (Psalm 116:13,) nor do I doubt but that by this outward sign he
   designates thanksgiving. I admit indeed that this sacrifice was not
   only offered in acknowledgment of gratitude, but also when they sought
   of God peace and good success; yet still the epithet will always
   admirably suit it, because they confessed by it that God was the author
   of all good things, so as to attribute all their prosperity to Him.
   First, however, he commands all the sacrifices to be brought to the
   tabernacle, which is what he means by "the face of God;" [254] else
   would altars have been everywhere erected in their cities and villages,
   and by this license God's service would have been mangled, and religion
   undermined. Wherefore, in order to keep the people in the unity of the
   faith, he bids them all be content with a single altar. But He would be
   worshipped and honored in that place, which He had dedicated to
   Himself, lest they should be scattered abroad after strange gods; and
   then He prescribes the mode of offering, whether the victim were of the
   herd or the flock. That such exact injunctions should be given as to
   trifles, might seem to be an unnecessary particularity, and even a
   superfluous repetition, inasmuch as the same thing is often inculcated,
   in precisely similar words: if it were not that this earnestness
   reminded the people that something higher was enwrapped in the
   ceremonies, whilst it restrained them from allowing themselves wantonly
   to add or change the smallest point. This very scrupulous observance,
   then, ought to have led them by the hand, as it were, to the things
   signified; so that under the external image the spiritual truth might
   meet their eyes; secondly, it ought to have held them bound, as it
   were, to the word of God, lest they should do anything in sacred
   matters from the dictates of their own reason. But now, since the use
   of sacrifices has ceased, we are first taught that God's blessings are
   profaned, unless we diligently exercise ourselves in manifesting our
   religion, as His infinite and constant liberality towards us deserves;
   secondly, that unless our devotion is unmixed and paid to Him alone, we
   impiously defraud Him of His right; thirdly, that as we pray in
   Christ's name, so our vows are to be paid, and our thanksgivings to be
   rendered, through His hand; and fourthly, that God's loving-kindness is
   not to be celebrated in a negligent or perfunctory manner, but that we
   must labor to do so, as in a matter of the utmost importance, with no
   common zeal and attention.

   16. And the priest shall burn them. He justly assigns to the priest the
   main duties of sacrificing, i.e., to sprinkle the blood, and to cast
   the fat into the fire, since he alone was competent to make atonement.
   Moreover, although there is a harsh metaphor contained in the word
   "food," yet it admirably expresses what the Holy Spirit would teach,
   that the legal service pleased God, just as the food which we eat is
   pleasing to us; whilst it at the same time marks God's familiar
   communion with His people, as if He sat at the same table with them. It
   is indeed sure that God, who breathes life into all, and borrows
   nothing from any, does not want food; but His incomparable kindness
   could not be better shewn forth, than by deigning to make Himself, as
   it were, the messmate of His worshippers. In the same figure of speech
   the ingratitude of the people is reproved by Malachi, when he says,

   "The table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even his
   meat, is contemptible," (Malachi 1:12;)

   not because God delighted in the fat of fed beasts, or in bread; but
   because it was a gross and intolerable act of impiety to neglect this
   extraordinary pledge of His grace. This similitude, however, ought to
   be referred to the truth it represents, viz., that the exercise of
   faith, and the proofs of our piety, are no less pleasing to God than as
   if He should be feasted delicately and sumptuously; wherefore we ought
   to take the greater care not to defraud Him of the things He takes
   delight in. It is not very clear to me why God claims for Himself the
   fat in all the sacrifices, and commands it to be burnt, unless that in
   this way He might accustom His servants to temperance. We have already
   seen that the fat is certainly accounted the most delicate part, where
   Moses applies this word to corn and wine; and this also is plain from
   Psalm 63:5, "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness."
   And when God declares (Isaiah 1:11,) that He does not desire "the fat,"
   He signifies that He does not require for His own sake the choicest
   part of animals, but that the Israelites might remember that they
   should partake soberly of all their food, as if they had consecrated
   the best and first-fruits of it. If any one desire a more distinct
   exposition of this, the offering of the fat taught them to pay more
   honor to the service of God; and secondly, it instructed them in
   abstinence. The allegories, suited only to tickle men's ears, must be
   sought from others. [255] Isychius, after having pretended that the fat
   represented spiritual affections, soon afterwards metamorphoses it into
   gross appetites. Others suppose that Christ was designed by it. Others
   understand by it that the grossness or fatness of our flesh must be
   refined by the fire of the Spirit, that it may be mortified unto God.
   This simple meaning satisfies me, that, when the Law permitted them to
   eat the sacred meats, an exception was added, which left the best
   portion in God's hands; secondly, that the part which might have been
   most attractive to the greedy, was consumed in the fire as a restraint
   upon their gluttony. The eating of blood is here prohibited, as also
   elsewhere, because it was consecrated to God in order to make
   expiation; but there was another and higher reason why it was
   forbidden, of which mention was made in [20]Genesis 9, and which must
   be [21]again handled in our exposition of the Sixth Commandment.

   [255] Abundance of these may be found collected by Lorinus. Bonar says,
   "Observe that all these portions of the animal are the richest; and
   also deep-seated, near the heart. In an offering of thanks and
   fellowship, nothing was more appropriate than to enjoin that the pieces
   presented should be those seated deep within." The marginal deduction
   of Corn. a Lapide, is not very dissimilar: "Mystice, adeps est devotio

   Leviticus 4

   leviticus 4:1-35

   1. And the LORD spakeunto Moses, saying,

   1. Alloquutus est praeterea Jehova Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
   through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
   concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any
   of them:

   2. Loquere ad filius Israel, dicendo, Anima quum peccaverit per errorem
   ab omnibus praeceptis Jehovae qusa non sunt facienda, feceritque
   quidpiam de uno ex illis:

   3. If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the
   people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young
   bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

   3. Si sacerdos unctus peccaverit secundum delictum populi, offeret
   sacrificium pro peccato suo quod peccavit, juvencum vitulum immaculatum
   Jehovae pro peccato.

   4. And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of
   the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the
   bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

   4. Adducetque juvencum ilum ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis in
   conspectu Jehovae, et admovebit manum suare super caput juvenci,
   mactabitque juvencum in conspectu Jehovah.

   5. And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,
   and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   5. Accipietque sacerdos unctus de sanguine juvenci, et inferet eum in
   tabernaculum conventionis.

   6. And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of
   the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the
   sanctuary.

   6. Dein sacerdos tinget digitum suum in sanguine, aspergetque de
   sanguine illo septem vicibus coram Jehova:

   7. And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
   altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of
   the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the
   bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   7. Ponetque sacerdos de sanguine isto super cornua altaris suffimenti
   aromataci coram Jehova, quod est in tabernaculo conventionis: totum
   autem sanguinem reliquum juvenci effundet ad basin altaris holocausti
   quod est ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   8. And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin
   offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is
   upon the inwards,

   8. Totum praeterea adipem juvenci oblati pro peccato tollet ab eo:
   nempe adipem operientem intestina, et totum adipem qui est super ca.

   9. And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away,

   9. Duos quoque renes, et adipem qui est super eos, et qui est super
   ilia, et fibram quae est super jecur, cum renibus auferet:

   10. As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
   offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt
   offering.

   10. Quemadmodum tollitur a bove sacrificii prosperitatum: adolebitque
   ea sacerdos super altare holocausti.

   11. And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and
   with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

   11. Pellem praeterea juvenci, et omnem carnem ejus, cum capite ejus, et
   cruribus, et intestina ejus, et timum ejus.

   12. Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto
   clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood
   with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

   12. Educetque totum juveneum extra castra ad locum mundum, ad locum ubi
   effundetur cinis: et comburet eum super ligna igni: in loco inquam ubi
   effunditur cinis, comburetur.

   13. And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and
   the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
   somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things
   which should not be done, and are guilty;

   13. Quod si tota synagoga Israel erraverit, et latuerit res in oculis
   congregationis, et fecerit unum ab omnibus praeceptis Jehovae qum non
   sunt facienda, et deliquerit:

   14. When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the
   congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him
   before the tabernale of the congregation.

   14. Notum autem fuerit peccatum quod peceaverunt: tune offeret
   congregatio juvencum filium bovis in sacrificium pro peccato,
   adducetque ilium ante tabernaculum conventionis,

   15. And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
   head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed
   before the LORD.

   15. Ponentque seniores synagogae marius suas super caput juvenci coram
   Jehova: tune mactabit juvencum coram Jehova.

   16. And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood
   to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   16. Inferetque sacerdos unctus de sanguine juvenci in tabernaculum
   conventionis.

   17. And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
   sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

   17. Et intinget sacerdos digitum suum in ipso sanguine, aspergetque
   septem vicibus coram Jehova ante velum.

   18. And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
   which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the
   altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of
   the congregation.

   18. De sanguine quoque illo ponet super cornua altaris, quod est coram
   Jehova, quod est inquam in tabernaculo conventionis, posthaec totum
   sanguinem reliquum effundet ad basin altaris holocausti quod est ad
   ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   19. And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

   19. Totum autem adipem ejus tollet ab eo, et adolebit super altare.

   20. And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a
   sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an
   atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

   20. Juvenco vero faciet quemadmodum fecit juvenco oblato pro peccato,
   sic faciet ei: atque expiabit eos sacerdos, et remittetur eis.

   21. And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him
   as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the
   congregation.

   21. Deinde juvencum educet extra castra, et comburet eum quemadmodum
   combussit juvencum priorem: oblatio pro peccato congregationis est.

   22. When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
   against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things
   which should not be done, and is guilty;

   22. Si princeps peccaverit, feceritque unum ab omnibus praeceptis
   Jehovae Dei sui quae non sunt facienda, et id fecerit per errorem, et
   deliquerit:

   23. Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he
   shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:

   23. Si innotuerit ei peccatum suum quod peccavit: tunc offeret
   oblationem suam hircum caprarum masculum immaculatum.

   24. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in
   the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a
   sin offering.

   24. Ponetque manum suam super caput hirci, et mactabit eum in loco in
   quo mactari solet holocaustum coram Jehova: oblatio pro peccato est.

   25. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
   finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and
   shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

   25. Tolletque sacerdos de sanguine oblationis pro peccato digito suo,
   et ponet super corrina altaris holocausti: reliquum autem sanguinem
   ejus effundet ad basin altaris holocausti.

   26. And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
   sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement
   for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

   26. Totum vero adipem ejus adolebit super altare, sicut adipem
   sacrificii prosperitatum: et ita expiabit ilium sacerdos a peccato
   ejus, et remittetur ei.

   27. And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he
   doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning
   things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

   27. Quod si anima aliqua peccaverit per errorem de populo terrae,
   faciendo unum a praeceptis Jehova quae non sunt facienda, et
   deliquerit:

   28. Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he
   shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish,
   for his sin which he hath sinned.

   28. Si innotuerit ei peccatum suum quod peccavit: afferet oblationem
   suam capellam caprarum immaculatam foeminam pro peccato suo quod
   peccavit.

   29. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
   slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

   29. Admovebitque manum suam super caput oblationis pro peccato, et
   mactabit oblationem illam pro peccato in loco holocausti.

   30. And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and
   put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour
   out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

   30. Dein tollet sacerdos de sanguine ejus digito suo, ponetque super
   cornua altaris holocausti: totum vero reliquum sanguinem ejus effundet
   ad basin altaris.

   31. And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken
   away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall
   burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest
   shalt make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

   31. Totum praeterea adipem ejus auferet, quemadmodum ablatus fuit adeps
   a sacrificio prosperitatum: adolebitque sacerdos super altare in odorem
   quietis Jehovae: atque ita expiabit eum sacerdos, et remittetur ei.

   32. And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
   female without blemish.

   32. Quod si pecudem obtulerit oblationem suam pro peccato, foeminam
   immaculatam afferet.

   33. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
   slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
   offering.

   33. Ponetque manum suam super caput illius oblationis pro peccato, et
   mactabit illam pro sacrificio peccati, in loco in quo mactare solet
   holocaustum.

   34. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
   finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and
   shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:

   34. Deinde accipiet sacerdos de sanguine oblationis pro peccato digito
   suo, ponetque super cornua altaris holocausti: totum vero reliquum
   sangninem ejus effundet ad basin altaris.

   35. And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb
   is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest
   shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire
   unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that
   he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

   35. Totum praeterea adipem qius auferet, quemadmodum auferri solet
   adeps agni a sacrificio prosperitatum: adolebitque illa sacerdos super
   altare in oblationem ignitam Jehovae: atque expiabit eum sacerdos a
   peccato suo quod peccavit, et remittetur el.


   After Moses had treated of the offerings and other sacrifices, which
   were testimonies of gratitude and exercises of piety, he now descends
   to the sin-offering (expiationem) which held the chief place amongst
   the sacrifices, inasmuch as, without reconciliation, there could never
   be any intercourse between men and God; for since He deservedly
   abominates the whole human race on account of the corruption of our
   nature, and because we all continually provoke His wrath, the whole
   hope of salvation must needs be founded on the remedies provided for
   propitiating Him. This principle, being established, we must remember
   that Moses will henceforth speak of the expiatory sacrifices which
   propitiate God to men by the removal of their guilt. He here shews how
   God is to be appeased, where a man shall have sinned through ignorance
   or inconsiderateness; wherein too a distinction is laid down between
   different persons, since one kind of victim is required of a king,
   another of the priests, and another of ordinary persons; whilst regard
   is had to the poor, that they may not be burdened by so great an
   expense as the rich. But, since it will appear from the context that
   all kinds of ignorance are not here included, we must see what the word
   sggh, shegagah, [256] means, which I have preferred rendering error
   rather than ignorance; for Moses does not refer to those transgressions
   into which we are ensnared, when we are led astray by the appearance of
   rectitude, so as to think ourselves without blame; but to those of
   which we take no heed, and whereby our minds are not pricked; or to
   those sudden falls, wherein the infirmity of the flesh so stifles the
   reason and the judgment as to blind the sinner. It is of such that Paul
   speaks when he bids us

   "restore in the spirit of meekness those who
   are overtaken in a fault," (Galatians 6:1;)

   for he does not mean those who are deceived by their good intentions
   (as they call it,) or rather by their foolish opinion, so as to be
   unconscious of their sin; but those who fall through the infirmity of
   their flesh, and whom Satan catches unawares in his snares; or who, at
   any rate, do not perceive the evil they have done, so as immediately to
   apply the remedy. This will be more clearly understood from Psalm
   19:12, 13, where David, having asked pardon for his errors, seeks to be
   kept free from presumptuous sins. [257] The antithesis between sgy'vt,
   shegioth, [258] and zdym, zedim, shews that those transgressions are
   called errors, in which there is no criminal pride against God. "If a
   soul shall sin -- from all the commandments," [259] is a harsh
   expression; and therefore some refer it to sins of omission, but I
   interpret it more simply, "If he sin by turning away from the
   commandments," or "if he commit any thing opposed (alienum)to the
   commandments."

   3. If the priest that is anointed. He now distinguishes between
   different persons, and begins with the high priest, who alone bore the
   high distinction of the holy unction, unless it be thought better to
   apply it to the whole supreme class. [260] It is probable, however,
   that it only refers to one. The more illustrious was his dignity, the
   more diligently and zealously ought his life to be confirmed to the
   model of holiness; and therefore the infirmity which was more tolerable
   in others, was more exceedingly reprehensible in him. This is the
   reason why it was required that he should atone for himself with a
   greater victim. But this in some measure related to all the Levites,
   inasmuch as they were chosen to be of the sacred class; and it now
   extends to all the ministers and pastors of the Church, not that they
   should ransom themselves by the sacrifice of a calf, but that they
   should diligently beware of every sin, and be more intent in their
   endeavors after holiness. The clause "according to the sin of the
   people," might be also rendered "unto the sin," etc., as though Moses
   had said that the priest through sin corrupted the people by his bad
   example; for, since his life is the rule of holiness and righteousness,
   so his faults give occasion to the errors of others. The sense,
   however, that I have followed is simpler, i.e., that though the
   transgression of the priest may be an ordinary one, yet in
   consideration of his office it becomes more weighty, and deserving of
   greater punishment.

   5. And the priest that is anointed shall take. It is well known that
   what is here prescribed as to the sprinkling of blood, and its pouring
   out, as well as to the burning of the fat and the kidneys, is the same
   as in the other sacrifices; and the comparison in the 10th verse
   sufficiently proves that, the ordinary forms were observed in other
   particulars. But inasmuch as it might seem absurd that the priest, who
   was himself guilty, should come before God to perform the office of
   reconciliation, it was necessary to prescribe the details more
   accurately, to obviate all doubt. Although, therefore, he was unworthy
   to approach God, yet, since the law of the priesthood was inviolable,
   he was admitted to the discharge of his duties; for it was not lawful
   that more mediators should be appointed. In order, then, that more
   reverence should be paid to the rites of the Law, and that men should
   seek after no other way of reconciliation, God extended His grace to
   the fault of the priest. The blood was sprinkled before the Lord, that
   the people might learn that through the sight of the sacrifice sins
   were hidden and buried, so as to come no more into remembrance before
   God; but the rest of the blood was poured before the altar, because it
   was holy, and therefore ought by no means to be cast elsewhere like
   anything profane.

   13. And if the whole congregation. The very same sacrifice which was
   enjoined on the priest is required of the people; since he who went
   into the sanctuary in the name of all to present all the tribes before
   God, represented the whole body. It seems indeed that the kind of
   ignorance here spoken of is different from the former kind; since it
   was said "if the thing be hid;" yet I think that these infirmities are
   comprised, in which it often happens that men are blinded for a time.
   [261] For many do not search into themselves, and therefore slumber in
   their sins; whereas if they honestly examined their doings, their
   conscience would straightway smite them. It might, then, happen that
   the whole people should fail to be aware of their sin, whilst dealing
   with themselves too gently and indulgently. The meaning therefore is,
   that although no sense of sin should at first arouse them to
   repentance, yet, if afterwards they should be awakened so as to begin
   to acknowledge their crime, God must be propitiated by sacrifices; for
   otherwise the people might make a cloak for themselves of their error.

   22. When a ruler hath sinned. A peculiar atonement is also appointed
   for the transgression of the rulers; and, although he speaks of the
   ruler in the singular number, yet inasmuch as the law was not yet
   enacted that one individual should bear rule, he undoubtedly designates
   the heads and governors generally, because they who bear rule do more
   injury by their bad example than private persons. If, then, any of the
   judges or governors had sinned through error, he might indeed be set
   free by a lesser victim than the priest or the whole people, yet there
   was individually this difference between them, that they were to offer
   she-goats or lambs, and the ruler a he-goat; and the object of this was
   that those in authority should more carefully keep themselves pure from
   every transgression, whereas otherwise they are wont to indulge
   themselves more freely, as if their rank and dignity allowed them
   greater license. Where we have given as our translation, "If (the sin)
   shall have become known," (si innotuerit,) translators are not agreed.
   [262] The word used is properly a disjunctive particle Or; [263] but it
   is sometimes used for the conditional particle, as we shall see in the
   next chapter. Those who retain the primary and genuine meaning of the
   word do violence to the signification of the last word of the foregoing
   verse, and translate it, "shall have offended" instead of "shall have
   felt that he has offended;" but since it appears from many passages
   that 'v, o, is equivalent to 'm, im, there is no need of wresting the
   words to an improper sense. The word hvd, hodang, which they render
   transitively "to make known," may fitly bear my translation, unless
   this is preferred, "if he shall have known," (si cognoverit) The words
   which Moses continually repeats, "the priest shall make an atonement
   for him, and his; iniquity shall be forgiven him," some coldly restrict
   to external and civil cleansing, as if Moses only removed his
   condemnation before men; but God rather offers pardon to sinners, and
   assures them that He will be favorable to them, lest fear or doubt
   should prevent them from freely calling upon Him. And assuredly those
   who do not acknowledge that the legal rites were sacraments, are not
   acquainted with the very rudiments of the faith. Now to all sacraments,
   at any rate to the common sacraments of the Church, a spiritual promise
   is annexed: it follows, therefore, that pardon was truly promised to
   the fathers, who reconciled themselves to God by the offering of
   sacrifices, not because the slaying of beasts expiated sins, but
   because it was a certain and infallible symbol, in which pious minds
   might acquiesce, so as to dare to come before God with tranquil
   confidence. In sum, as now in baptism sins are sacramentally washed
   away, so under the Law also the sacrifices were means of expiation,
   though in a different way; since baptism sets Christ before us as if He
   were present, whilst under the Law He was only obscurely typified.
   Figuratively indeed what applies to Christ only is transferred to the
   signs, for in Him alone was manifested to us the fulfillment of all
   spiritual blessings, and He at length blotted out sins by His one and
   perpetual sacrifice; but since the question here is not as to the value
   of the legal ceremonies in themselves, let it suffice that they truly
   testified of the grace of God, of which they were the types; and so let
   not that profane imagination be listened to, that the sacrifices only
   politically and as far as regarded men absolved those by whom they were
   offered from guilt and condemnation.

   Numbers 15

   Numbers 15:22-29

   22. And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
   which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

   22. Quum erraveritis, et non feceritis onmia praecepta haec quae
   protulit Jehova ad Mosen.

   23. Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses,
   from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your
   generations;

   23. Omnia quae praecepit Jehova vobis per manum Mosis a die qua
   praecepit Jehova et postea per generationes vestras.

   24. Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the
   knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer
   one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the
   LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the
   manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

   24. Si inquam a congregatione procter scientiam allquid factum fluerit
   per errorera, immolabit universa congregatio juvencum unum filium
   bovis, in holocaustum in odorera quietis Jehovae, minha quoque ejus, et
   libamen ejus, secundum regulam, et hircum caprarum unum, in sacrificium
   pro peccato.

   25. And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of
   the children of Israel, and it shall forgiven them; for it is
   ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by
   fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their
   ignorance:

   25. Expiabitque sacerdos universam congregationem filiorum Israel, et
   ignoscetur els, quia error est, et illic offerent oblationem suam,
   oblationem ignitam Jehovae, et oblationem pro peccato suo, coram
   Jehova, propter errorera ipsorum.

   26. And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of
   Israel, and the stranger that sojurneth among them; seeing all the
   people were in ignorance.

   26. Et condonabitur universae congregationi filiorum Israel, et
   peregrino qui peregrinabitur in medio illorum: quia universi populi
   error est.

   27. And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
   she-goat of the first year for a sin offering.

   27. Quod si anima una peccaverit per errorem, offeret capram anniculam
   sacrificium pro peccato.

   28. And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
   ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an
   atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

   28. Expiabitque sacerdos animam quae peccaverit per errorem, quum
   peccaverit per errorera coram Jehova: expiabit eam, et remittetur ei.

   29. Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both
   for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger
   that sojourneth among them.

   29. Indigence inter filios Israel, et peregrino qui peregrinatur inter
   illos, lex una erit vobis quoad eum qui fecerit per errorem.


   22. And if ye have erred. He teaches by what kind of sacrifice the sins
   of the whole people or of each individual are to be expiated, although
   he enumerates only two of the four classes which are mentioned in
   Leviticus; for a special atonement is there enjoined both on the priest
   and the ruler. But neither is the ceremony of sacrificing here
   described, since Moses only wished to refresh their memories by the way
   as to the manner in which, either publicly or privately, they were to
   be reconciled to God. This word "error," [264] as we have said, extends
   to incogitancy, which partakes of contempt of God, and arises from too
   great security, when men inconsiderately fall into the sins to which
   their lusts invite them; for deliberate impiety is afterwards brought
   into contrast with error, when men designedly rush into violations of
   the law. But since nothing is more easy than for men to err, this
   remedy was most necessary, lest they who had sinned should fall into
   despair. Lest, then, the people or private individuals, when they saw
   their guilt, should despair of pardon and throw away the pursuit of
   holiness, God anticipates them, and shews them by what means He is to
   be propitiated, so that the sins which had occurred should not
   interrupt His service. Since, however, Moses here only repeats what has
   already been explained, there is no need of dwelling largely upon it,
   except that in one point he seems to deliver a law different from the
   former one; for he there commands two bullocks to be slain for the
   reconciliation of the people, [265] the one as a burnt-offering, the
   other as a sin-offering; yet, if the second were not easily obtained,
   the permission was given to substitute a goat. In Leviticus, therefore,
   the regular and perfect rite was delivered; the permissive alteration
   is only added here; nor does Moses contradict himself, though, for the
   sake of brevity, he only refers to one of the two modes. At the end a
   clearer explanation is subjoined, viz., that the same law should be
   common to all, since it was by no means expedient to introduce any
   diversity.

   [264] "Ce mot d'inadvertence." -- Fr.

   [265] "This law differs from Leviticus 4:13, 14. Outram thinks the
   bullock was to be offered under that law when the whole congregation of
   Israel, though in other respects retaining their own rites and
   following the worship of the true God, yet, led away by one common
   error, transgressed, without knowing it, some prohibitory precept. The
   kid for a sin-offering, accompanied with a bullock for a
   burnt-offering, (see ver. 24,) Outram says he apprehends to have been
   required when the people, neglecting their ancient rites and unmindful
   of the divine laws, (which often happened under wicked kings,) were
   seduced into strange worship. What is recorded in 2 Chronicles 28:24,
   29:3, 21, 24, Outram thinks adds much probability to his opinion. See
   Outram, D. 1, ch. 14, Section 2." -- Brightwell in loco.

   Leviticus 5

   Leviticus 5:1-13

   1. And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness,
   whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he
   shall bear his iniquity.

   1. Quum autem anima peccaverit audiendo vocem juramenti, et ipsc sit
   testis, quod aut videtit, aut sciverit: nisi renuntitaverit, feret
   poenam iniquitatis suae.

   2. Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an
   unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of
   unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be
   unclean, and guilty.

   2. Aut si anima tetigerit aliquam remimmundam, sive cadaver ferae
   immundae, sive cadaver animalis immundi, sive cadaver reptilis immundi,
   idque latuerit eam, tum ipsc immundus erit, et deliquit.-

   3. Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be
   that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
   knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

   3. Aut si tetigerit immunditiam hominis in omni immunditia ejus qua
   polluitur, et latuerit eum, et ipse cognoverit postea, deliquit.

   4. Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
   good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it
   be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one
   of these.

   4. Aut anima si juraverit, proferendo labiis se malefacturam, aut
   benefacturam, et secundum omne quod profert homo juramento, et id
   latuerit eum, et ipse postea cognoverit: tunc delinquet in uno ex
   istis.

   5. And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,
   that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:

   5. Erit autem quum deliquerit in uno ex istis, et confessus fuerit id
   super quo peccavit.

   6. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin
   which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the
   goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
   him concerning his sin.

   6. Adducet oblationem pro delicto suo Jehovae, pro peccato suo quod
   peccaverit, foeminam de grege, agnam, aut capellam caprarum pro
   peccato: et expiabit eum sacerdos a peccato suo.

   7. And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
   trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young
   pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a
   burnt offering.

   7. Quod si facultas afferendae peendis defuerit ei, tunc adducet
   oblationem pro delicto suo quod peccavit, duos turtures, aut duos
   pullos columbae Jehovae, unum in hostiam pro peccato, et alterum in
   hostism holocausti.

   8. And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which
   is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck,
   but shall not divide it asunder:

   8. Afferetque illos ad sacerdotem, et offeret eum qui est in hostism
   pro peccato, priorem: et ungue secabit caput ipsius e regione cervicis
   ejus, et non separabit.

   9. And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side
   of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the
   bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

   9. Aspergetque de sanguine hostiae pro peccato super parietem altaris,
   et quod superest de sanguine exprimetur in basin ipsius altaris:
   oblatio pro peccato est.

   10. And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
   the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
   which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

   10. Alterum autem faciet holocaustum juxta morem: atque its expiabit
   eum sacerdos a peccato suo quod peccavit, et remittetur ei.

   11. But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
   pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth
   part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
   upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin
   offering.

   11. Si vero non fuerit ei facultas offerendi duos turtures, aut duos
   pullos columbae, tunc afferet oblationem suam qui peccaverit, decimam
   partem epha similae in oblationem pro peccato: non ponet super eam
   oleum, neque ponet super cam thus, quia oblatio pro peccato est.

   12. Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his
   handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,
   according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin
   offering.

   12. Afferet illam inquam ad sacerdotem: tune sacerdos accipiet ex ea
   plenum pugilium suum odorem ejus, et adolebit super altare ultra
   oblationes ignitas Jehovae: oblatio pro peccato est.

   13. And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin
   that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and
   the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

   13. Et expiabit eum sacerdos a peccato suo quod peccavit in uno de
   istis: et remittetur el, et erit sacerdoti sicut minha.


   1. And if a soul sin. The three kinds of offense, to which Moses refers
   in the beginning of the chapter, seem to differ much from each other;
   for the first, when a person concealed a matter which he knew, could
   not arise from error, yet I include this concealment of which he treats
   under the head of error, by supposing it to have been when a person
   should be induced by shame or fear to connive at any crime or offense
   respecting which he might be interrogated, and so, without any design
   of perjuring himself, but by blinding himself, should withhold what he
   would have said, if he had duly examined the matter. Yet these words
   must be more narrowly discussed, respecting the meaning of which men
   are not well agreed. Some think that the word 'lh, [266] alah, is put
   for "execration," as though it were said, if any shall have heard a
   misdoing or detestable crime worthy of execration; yet their gloss is
   contradicted by what immediately follows, "Whether he hath seen or
   known it." Others indeed interpret it to mean an oath, yet improperly
   confine it to perjury, as if Moses stated that he was guilty who had
   heard a man perjuring himself, and had not opposed him, but had rather
   covered the perjury by his own connivance or silence. I rather
   subscribe, then, to their opinion who expound it as meaning
   "adjuration;" for the words will thus combine very well, "If any one,
   being summoned as a witness, shall have heard the voice of adjuration,
   whereby he shall be required in God's name to answer truly as to the
   matter proposed, and from favor, or good nature, or any other false
   pretext, as if he were enveloped in a cloud of error, shall conceal
   what, if he had paid diligent attention, he well knew, he shall be
   guilty." We must then here render the disjunctive particle as the
   conditional. Literally it is, "If any shall have heard the voice of
   adjuration, and (is) himself a witness." But wherefore should he say,
   "if he hath been a witness," and then add, "or have known it," as if he
   referred to different things? What I have said squares very well, that
   a person becomes himself guilty, who, when summoned as a witness, does
   not answer to a matter of which he is cognizant. Now, what does hearing
   the voice of adjuration mean, unless you understand that he is adjured
   by the mouth of a judge? We must observe, too, that the three kinds of
   sin which are first enumerated have a connection with each other, since
   they speak of sinners who are infected by the uncleanness of others;
   for, after Moses had commanded generally that offenses committed in
   error should be expiated, he now adds what had not been stated
   explicitly enough, that those also required atonement who had been
   polluted by the defilements of others. Thus this first will accord very
   well with the other two, i.e., that if any should make himself an
   accomplice in the offense of another, by indirect perjury, he should be
   unclean until he had offered a propitiation; for this is what the
   expression "bear his iniquity" conveys; as if Moses had said that he
   contracts guilt who shall have concealed a crime, respecting which he
   had been interrogated as a witness.

   2. Or if a soul touch any unclean thing. This precept seems not only to
   be superfluous but also absurd; for Moses had already shewn
   sufficiently how uncleanness contracted by touching a dead body, or any
   other unclean thing, was to be purged, and had prescribed an easy and
   inexpensive mode of purification. This repetition appears, therefore,
   to be useless. But to impose a heavier punishment on an offense which
   is extenuated by the pretext of error, than where there is no allusion
   to error, is unjust. But we must remember that not only is the
   uncleanness itself here punished, but; the inadvertence, from whence it
   arose that he who was polluted omitted the purification. For it may be
   that those who thus lie torpid in their sins pollute for a season the
   service of God. No wonder, then, that a heavier punishment is
   inflicted, where error, springing from supine and gross security,
   begets still more sins, that thus believers may be aroused to greater
   vigilance. Let the reader, therefore, recollect that the offense which
   is now adverted to did not consist in the mere touching of a dead body,
   but in the thoughtlessness itself; for if all would diligently meditate
   on the Law of God, forgetfulness would not so easily steal over them,
   whereby the distinction between right and wrong is lost. The same is
   the reason for the following ordinance, where Moses subjects to the
   same punishment any one who shall have touched an unclean or defiled
   man: thus the very contact of a woman at a particular period produces
   pollution.

   4. Or if a soul shall swear. The Gulf is also ascribed to error and
   ignorance, when a person does inconsiderately what he has promised not
   to do; for the oath is not in that case violated, which would be
   criminal; [267] but in this very carelessness there is enough of wrong,
   because sound religion would renew the recollection of the vow.
   Consequently, where no anxiety (to fulfill it) is shewn, there is no
   serious desire to do so. But this commandment was necessary, because it
   might often happen that men who had pledged their faith in a vow, and
   had broken it in thoughtlessness, would deem themselves released from
   every, and would in future give themselves up to indulgence, whereas
   they who arrive at such a pitch of licentiousness, harden themselves
   more and more, until at length they throw off all reverence for God.
   God would therefore have vows kept faithfully, lest those who despised
   them should thus rush into impiety. If then any one had thoughtlessly
   broken faith, he is commanded to make atonement to God; not on account
   of his levity, as some think, as if he had rashly promised what he
   might not, but on account of his neglect, because he had not given
   diligence to remember the vow at the proper time. Now if the Papists
   stupidly wrest this text after their custom, in order to establish the
   obligation of all kinds of vows, their confutation is easy; viz., that
   God requires this stedfastness only with respect to lawful vows duly
   made. We have already understood from the teaching of Moses, what is
   the rule of pious vow-making; whence we gather, that those which
   profane God's name are by no means to be kept; for if we set out with
   doing wrong, obstinacy in it is doubly wicked. In this passage,
   therefore, "to do evil" is not to perform any improper action, but to
   undertake something which would otherwise be disagreeable and
   burdensome to the flesh; such as to diminish domestic expenditure, or
   to deprive one's self of luxuries, or to determine upon abstinence from
   something which would gratify or profit us.

   6. And he shall bring his trespass-offering. He proceeds with what we
   have already been considering, as to the removal of guilt by sacrifice;
   but he begins to make a distinction between the poor and the rich,
   which distinction applies also to what has gone before; hence it
   appears that the order is not exactly observed by Moses, since the
   cases which he inserts seem to interrupt the thread of his discourse;
   yet the fact remains clear, that whosoever have fallen through error
   are unclean until they have offered an atonement. But what had been
   before omitted is here inserted, that the poor and needy are not to be
   pressed beyond the extent of their means; nay, the different grades of
   offering are appointed, so that he to whom it was not convenient to
   offer two turtle-doves, or pigeons, might be quit for a small measure
   of flour. Hence we infer that God's only design was to shew the one
   true means of reconciliation to the people, that they might have
   recourse to the Mediator and His sacrifice; for the poor are here
   commanded to offer either two turtle-doves, or a small quantity of
   meal, which would propitiate God towards them, just as much as would
   the victim required of the rich. The citation, [268] however, which our
   interpreters make from the poet is a lame one; viz., "Whoever shall
   have brought integrity of mind into the temples, makes a sacrifice of
   corn;" since this blind man did not see what was the object of
   sacrifices, and thus despised all kinds of propitiations, as if purity
   and innocency alone recommended men to God. We must remember, then,
   that the victims of themselves were of no importance, and yet that the
   ancient people were exercised in these ceremonies, to teach them that
   God can only be appeased by the payment of a ransom.

   Leviticus 5

   Leviticus 5:14-19

   14. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   14. Loquutus est insuper Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   15. If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy
   things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD
   a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels
   of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:

   15. Anima quum praevaricata fuerit praevaricationem, et peccaverit per
   errorem in una re ex sanctificationibus Jehovae, adducat oblationem pro
   delicto suo Jehovae, arietem perfectum de pecudibus, secundum
   aestimationem tuam argenti siculorum, secundum siculum sanctitatis pro
   delicto.

   16. And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
   thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the
   priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
   the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

   16. Et quod peccaverit in sanctificatione reddet, et quintam partem
   ipsius addet ei, tradetque illud sacerdoti, sacerdos vero expiabit eum
   in ariete oblationis pro delicto: et remittetur ei.

   17. And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
   forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it
   not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

   17. Itaque si anima peccaverit, et fecerit unum ab omnibus praeceptis
   Jehovae, quae non sunt facienda, et non cognoverit, et deliquerit, et
   portaverit iniquitatem suam:

   18. And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
   estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest
   shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he
   erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

   18. Tunc adducet arietem immaculatum de pecudibus, secundum
   aestimationem tuam in oblationem pro delicto ad sacerdotem, et expiabit
   eum sacerdos ab errore suo quem per errorem commisit, neque intellexit,
   et remittetur el.

   19. It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the
   LORD.

   19. Delictum est, delinquendo deliquit Jehovae.


   14. And the Lord spake unto Moses. The difference of the victim clearly
   shews, that another kind of offense is here referred to; for God now
   requires a male instead of a female. Before, He had been contented with
   an ewe lamb or a female kid; but inasmuch as a ram is more valuable, it
   follows that punishment is now awarded to a heavier offense. The
   heinousness of the fault depends upon the quality of the act; i.e.,
   when a person shall have wronged not a mortal man merely, but God
   Himself, nor shall have transgressed only one of the Commandments of
   the first Table, but shall not have paid a vow, or shall have offered a
   defective victim, or shall have defrauded God of His right in any
   oblation; since this is what is meant by the clause "in the holy things
   of the Lord." In this expression Moses includes both vows voluntarily
   made, as well as the legitimate oblations, such as tithes,
   first-fruits, the offering of the first-born; since in all these things
   the Israelites were strictly charged to deal most faithfully with God.
   If by chance avarice had blinded any one, so that in pursuit of
   personal gain he paid God less than he ought, his recklessness justly
   received a heavier punishment. Yet it must be understood, that the
   offense here referred to is one in which no fraud or evil deceit had
   place; for if any one had designedly and craftily appropriated what was
   sacred, the impiety of this sacrilege was not so easily expiated. But
   inasmuch as it often happens that the covetous and grasping are too
   ready to spare themselves, God enjoins a sacrifice in such a case,
   where private advantage has through thoughtlessness prevailed over
   religious feeling. The words, "with thy estimation," some refer to
   Moses, others to the priest; but I prefer taking it passively for the
   estimation prescribed by God; which is called the estimation of the
   people, because they were bound to acquiesce in the Law appointed by
   Him, and not arbitrarily to alter the value. Moses estimates the ram at
   two shekels of the sanctuary, equivalent to four common shekels, [269]
   amounting in French money to about twenty-eight sols, (asses.)

   16. And he shall make amends for the harm. Hence it more plainly
   appears, as I have recently stated, that they, who withheld anything of
   God's full right, are said to have sinned "in the holy thing;" since
   they are commanded to make restitution with the addition of a fifth
   part. Yet let my readers remember, that those who are compelled to make
   restitution, are not such as have fraudulently embezzled the sacred
   things, but those who under some vain pretext have flattered themselves
   for a time, so as to be unaffected by any conviction of their fault.
   The object therefore of this sacrifice, was to arouse the people to
   attention, so that postponing their private advantage, they should
   freely pay what was due to God. [270] Theirs is but foolish trifling
   who think that Moses, having before spoken of sins (peccata), now
   prescribes the mode of making expiation for delinquencies (delicta),
   since he uses the same words indifferently on all occasions, and also
   designates all the victims by the same name. But to make out a
   delinquency to be greater than a sin is a piece of gross ignorance; nor
   does it need a long refutation, since it manifestly appears that in
   this passage a special rule is delivered as to the means of obtaining
   pardon when a person through thoughtlessness has not reflected that he
   has omitted to discharge in full either his vows or oblations.

   17. And if soul sin. Although the expressions seem to be general, as if
   he briefly confirmed what he had said before, yet it is necessary to
   connect them with the last sentence, or at least to restrict them to
   certain cases. The former exposition appears to me to be the right one;
   nor is there any absurdity in the repetition, to cut off all occasion
   for subterfuge from the disobedient. Still I do not deny that the
   reason which is added at the end, applies to all the modes of expiation
   of which he has been treating; viz., that although he may pretend
   ignorance who has fallen into sin inconsiderately, or who has not
   intentionally sinned, or who through forgetfulness has contracted any
   defilement, still he is guilty before God until he makes
   reconciliation. When therefore he again commands that a ram without
   blemish, and of full value should be offered, he once more shews how
   they must purge themselves who have been too stingy in their oblations.
   Immediately after he adds a reason common to all the other errors; as
   if he had said, that they are not absolved before God who offer the
   excuse of ignorance as a cover for their fault.

   Leviticus 6

   Leviticus 6:1-7

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est praterea Jehova ipsi Mosi, dicendo:

   2. If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto
   his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in
   fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his
   neighbour;

   2. Anima quum peccaverit, et praevaricata fuerit praevaricationem
   contra Jehovam, mentiens nempe fuerit proximo suo in deposito, ant in
   depositione manus, aut raptum, ant vim fecerit proximo suo.

   3. Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and
   sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning
   therein:

   3. Aut invenerit amissum, et negaverit illud, ac juraverit falso in uno
   ex omnibus quae facere solet homo peccando in ipsis.

   4. Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he
   shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he
   hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or
   the lost thing which he found,

   4. Quum ergo peccaverit, et dell querit, tum reddet raptum quod rapuit,
   aut vi extortum quod vi extorsit, aut depositum quod depositum fuerit
   apud illum, vel amissum quod invenerit.

   5. Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore
   it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and
   give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass
   offering.

   5. Aut quidpiam aliud ex omnibus de quibus juraverit falso, tune reddet
   illud in solidum, et quintum ipsius addet illi: eique cujus erat reddet
   illud die oblationis pro delicto suo.

   6. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
   without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
   offerring, unto the priest:

   6. Oblationem vero pro delicto suo adducet Jehovae, arietem integrum e
   pecudibus, secundum estimationem suam ad faciendum sacrificium pro
   delicto ad sacerdotem.

   7. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD; and
   it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in
   trespassing therein.

   7. Expiabit eum sacerdos eoram Jehova, et remittetur el, expiabit
   inquam ab uno ex omnibus quae facere solet homo delinquendo in eo.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Moses now no longer treats of the
   means of expiating errors when the sinner is guilty through
   thoughtlessness; but he prescribes the mode of reconciliation, when any
   one shall have wilfully and designedly offended God. And this is well
   worthy of notice, lest those who may have been guilty of voluntary sin
   should doubt whether God will be propitiated towards them, provided
   they make application to the one sacrifice of Christ, in which consists
   the entire substance of the shadows of the Law. We must indeed beware
   lest we indulge ourselves under the cover of God's clemency and
   readiness to pardon, -- for the lust of the flesh provokes us to sin
   more than enough, without the addition of this snare, -- nor is it less
   than a blasphemous insult to God to take occasion and license for sin,
   from the fact of His willingness to pardon. Let then the fear of God
   reign in us, which will repress our wicked desires like a rein, so that
   we should not wilfully fall into sin; and let His mercy rather engender
   the hatred and detestation of sin in our hearts, than incite us to
   audacity. Yet, at the same time, we must prudently take heed, lest if
   we imagine God to be inexorable to our voluntary sins, this excessive
   severity should overthrow the hope of salvation even in those who are
   the holiest. For even now-a-days there are some madmen who deny pardon
   to all who may have chanted to fall through the infirmity of the flesh,
   since to morose men this severity has its charms, and by this
   hallucination Novatus [271] greatly troubled the Church of old. But if
   we all honestly examine ourselves, it will plainly appear that those
   rigid censors, who affect the reputation of sanctity by immoderate
   asperity, are the grossest hypocrites. For if they would abandon their
   pride, and examine into their lives, which of them would find himself
   free from concupiscence? and whose conscience must not often smite him?

   It is then monstrous blindness to exalt men, clothed in human flesh, to
   such a pitch of perfection, as that their conscience should not convict
   them of any fault or blame. And nothing is more pestilent than this
   imposture of the devil, excluding from the hope of pardon those who
   knowingly and willingly have sinned; since there is not one even of
   God's best servants, in whom the corrupt affections of the flesh do not
   sometimes prevail; for although they be neither adulterers, nor
   thieves, nor murderers, yet there is none whom the last Commandment of
   the Law -- "Thou shalt not covet," -- does not convict of sin. And
   assuredly the more advance one has made in endeavors after purity, the
   more he feels and acknowledges that he is still very far from reaching
   its goal. Therefore, unless we would purposely close the gate of
   salvation against us, we must hold that God is placable towards all,
   who trust that their sin is forgiven them by the sacrifice of Christ;
   for God is neither changed, nor is our condition worse than that of the
   fathers, whereas under the Law God appointed sacrifices for the
   expiation even of voluntary offenses. Hence it follows, that although
   we are convicted of voluntary sin, yet a remedy is set before us in the
   Gospel for procuring pardon: else would these ancient figures be more
   than delusive, which had no other object than to be testimonies and
   mirrors of the grace which was finally manifested to us in Christ. If
   there ought to be a mutual agreement between the external
   representation of grace under the Law, and the spiritual effect which
   Christ brought in, it plainly appears that sins are no less forgiven to
   us now, than to the ancient people; and thus that believers are
   reminded by this symbol, that they are not to despair of
   reconciliation, whilst they take no pleasure in their sins; but rather
   that they should boldly seek for pardon in the perpetual sacrifice
   which constantly renders God favorable to all the godly. And surely
   since repentance and faith are the sure pledges of God's favor, it
   cannot be but that they should be received into His grace who are
   endued with these two gifts. Besides, the remission of sins is an
   inestimable treasure, which God has deposited in His Church, to be the
   peculiar blessing of His children; as the Confession of Faith declares,
   "I believe in the Holy Catholic Church, the forgiveness of sins." Nor
   would what Paul proclaims concerning the embassy entrusted to him be
   consistent, unless Christ's satisfaction daily propitiated God towards
   believers. (2 Corinthians 5:20.)

   The question here is not about some trifling offense, but about the
   crime of unfaithfulness, doubled by the addition of perjury. It is true
   that perfidy, or deceit, or violence, are first mentioned, to mark the
   grossness of the sin; but the guilt lies chiefly in the profanation of
   God's name when the injury done to man is sheltered under a false oath.
   At any rate, he is admitted to pardon who has both iniquitously
   deceived his brother and has impiously abused God's name. Hence it
   appears that God spares wretched sinners although they may have
   contaminated themselves by faithlessness, and have aggravated the crime
   committed against men by sacrilege, having insulted God through their
   perjury. But although Moses only enumerates transgressions of the
   Eighth Commandment, still he teaches, according to his usual manner, by
   synecdoche what must be done in the case of other offenses also. If,
   then, anything shall have been taken away by violence, or by fraud, and
   perjury has been superadded, he commands not only that satisfaction
   should be made to the neighbor who is defrauded, but that the price of
   atonement should also be offered to God. And the reason for this is
   expressly given, because not only has a mortal man been injured, but
   God has also been offended, who would have men conduct themselves
   justly and reverently towards each other; and then the crime is carried
   to extremity by the violation of God's sacred name. The sacrifice is
   not indeed required from a thief or robber, or from the denier of a
   deposit, or the appropriator of anything lost, unless they have also
   perjured themselves; yet the words of Moses are not without their
   weight: if any one, by the denial of a deposit, or by theft, or
   robbery, shall have "committed a trespass against the Lord;" whereby he
   signifies, that whenever an injury is inflicted on men, God in their
   person is offended, because every transgression of the Law violates and
   perverts His justice.

   We shall elsewhere see more about the restitution to be made in case of
   theft or robbery, especially when a person has been found guilty. This
   point, however, is alone referred to directly in this passage, viz.,
   that whoever injures or inflicts a loss upon his brother, incurs guilt
   and condemnation before God; but if he proceeds to such a pitch of
   obstinacy, as to cover his crime by falsely appealing to the sacred
   name of God, he is polluted by double iniquity, so that compensation of
   the damage is not sufficient, but he must also make atonement to God.
   But we must understand this of those who, having escaped from the fear
   of punishment, voluntarily repent. The notion of some commentators who
   alter the copula into the disjunctive particle, and consider perjury to
   be one of the various sins referred to, I reject as foreign to the
   meaning of Moses. Others explain it thus: "If any shall have committed
   robbery or theft, or shall have sworn falsely about a thing lawful in
   itself:" but I do not see why the words should be wrested thus;
   besides, their mistake is refitted by the context itself, in which
   restitution is coupled with the sacrifices, and this could not be
   applicable unless perjury were conjoined also with fraud or violence.
   Nor does the disjunctive particle which follows help them; for after he
   has commanded what was taken away by force or deceit to be restored,
   because all the various points could not be separately expressed, it is
   added, "Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely," not as if the
   guilt of perjury had been contracted in any other matters, but that he
   might cut away all means of subterfuge, which the repetition also
   confirms; for, after having introduced the crime of swearing falsely,
   he again, as if more clearly explaining what he had said, commands the
   restitution of the principal, together with the fifth part. But what is
   it that he commands to be restored except what the deceiver had kept
   back under cover of his oath? Of this a clearer exposition will be
   found under the Eighth Commandment.

   A satisfaction is therefore enjoined to be made towards men together
   with the offering. Nor is it without reason that God commands them to
   make up the loss on the day when the offering is made, lest hypocrites
   should promise themselves impunity after having enriched themselves by
   the property of another. It was indeed permitted them to restore their
   property to others before they propitiated God by the sacrifice; but
   God will not have His altar defiled, which would be the case if thieves
   or robbers offered victims belonging to others. He would, therefore,
   have the hands of those who sacrifice cleansed from pollution. And
   surely those who offer a victim to God out of spoils unjustly obtained,
   in some measure implicate Him as a participator in their crime. Hence
   may profitable instruction be drawn, viz., that hypocrites busy
   themselves in vain in reconciling God to themselves, unless they
   honestly restore what they have unjustly taken. Meanwhile we must
   observe the distinction in the words of Moses between the satisfaction
   made to men and the sin-offering which propitiates God; for we gather
   from hence, as I have said, that they obtain not pardon from God who
   desire to remain enriched by their stolen property; and yet that God is
   not appeased by anything but sacrifice. Clear proof of this latter
   point may be gathered from the whole Law, which prescribes but one
   means of reconciling God, i.e., when the sinner makes atonement for
   himself by offering a victim. Hence the diabolical figment as to
   satisfactions is refuted [272] by which the Papists imagine that they
   are redeemed from God's judgment; for although God shall have remitted
   the guilt, they still think that the liability to punishment remains,
   until the sinner shall have delivered himself by his own works. To this
   end they have invented works of supererogation, to be meritorious in
   redeeming from punishment; hence, too, purgatory has come into
   existence. But when you have studied all the writings of Moses, and
   diligently weighed whatsoever is revealed in the Law as to the means of
   appeasing God, you will find that the Jews were everywhere brought back
   to sacrifices. Now, it is certain that whatever is attributed to
   sacrifices is so much taken away from men's own works. But if it were
   not God's intention to down His ancient people to outward ceremonies,
   it follows that it is only by the one Mediator, through the outpouring
   of His blood, that men are absolved from all liability either to guilt
   or punishment, so as to be restored to favor by God.

   7. And the priest shall make an atonement. From this form of expression
   also, which frequently occurs, we must learn that the victim in itself
   was not the price of redemption, but that expiation was founded on the
   priesthood. For they have foolishly and falsely invented the notion
   that men work something themselves in the sacraments, [273] whereas
   their virtue and effect proceeds from quite another quarter. The
   offering, therefore, properly speaking, is passive rather than active
   as regards man. [274] The force of this will be more clearly understood
   from the delusion of the Papists. They are indeed compelled to
   acknowledge that in the sacraments men are passive, in so far as they
   receive the grace there offered to them; but they presently pervert
   this doctrine, by inventing their opus operatum, as they call it. But,
   lest the people should think that they bring from their own stores
   (domo) the price of their redemption, Moses constantly inculcates that
   it is the peculiar office of the priest, to appease God, and to blot
   out sin by expiation. It is also worthy of observation that he adds,
   "before the Lord," for by this clause the profane notion is refuted,
   that men are purged by the legal sacrifices only civilly, as they say,
   i.e., before men, as if there were no spiritual promise included in
   them. Now, if this were so, the fathers would have been confirmed in
   the confidence of pardon by no external symbols, than which nothing can
   be more absurd; but by this one clause all ambiguity is removed, when
   Moses declares that they were absolved "before the Lord."

   Leviticus 6

   Leviticus 6:8-15, 23-25, 30

   8. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   8. Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt
   offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the
   altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be
   burning in it.

   9. Praecipe Aharon et filiis ejus, dicendo, Haec est lex holocausti,
   (holocaustum est, quod aduritur super altare tota nocte usque mane, ubi
   ignis altari accensus fuerit in eo.)

   10. And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
   breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
   fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall
   put them beside the altar.

   10. Induet se sacerdos veste linen, femoralibus item lineis induct se
   super carnem suam, tolletque cinerem quum absumpserit ignis holocaustum
   ex altari, et ponet eum secus altare.

   11. And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
   carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

   11. Postea exuet se vestibus suis, et induet se vestibus allis,
   efferetque cinerem extra castra ad locum mundam.

   12. And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be
   put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay
   the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat
   of the peace offerings.

   12. Et ignis super altare ardebit in eo, non extinguetur, et accendet
   in eo sacerdos ligna quotidie mane, et disponet super illud victimam
   holocausti, adolebitque super illud adipes prosperitatum.

   13. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
   out.

   13. Ignis perpetuo ardebit in altari, non extinguetur.

   14. And this is the law of the meat offering: The sons of Aaron shall
   offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

   14. Ista est lex minha quam offerent filii Aharon coram Jehova ad
   altare.

   15. And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
   offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is
   upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
   savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.

   15. Tollet ex ea pugillo suo ex simila minha, et oleo ejus, et totum
   thus quod erit super minha: adolebitque super altare odorem quietis
   odorem ejus apud Jehovam.

   23. For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
   shall not be eaten.

   23. Omnis minha sacerdotis tota eremabitur, non comedetur.

   24. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   24. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   25. Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the
   sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the
   sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.

   25. Alloquere Aharon et filios ejus, dicendo, Ista eat lex hostile pro
   peccato, In loco in quo mactabitur hostia holocausti mactabitur hostia
   pro peccato coram Jehova, quia sanctificatio sanctificationum est.

   30. And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
   tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,
   shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

   30. Omnis autem hostia pro peccato, de cujus sanguine inferetur aliquid
   in tabernaculum conventionis, ad expiandum in sanctuario non comedetur,
   igni comburetur.


   9. Command Aaron and his sons. He more distinctly explains what might
   have appeared to be omitted; nor is it without reason that he carefully
   enters into these full details, for since God prefers obedience to all
   sacrifices, he was unwilling that anything should remain doubtful as to
   the external rites, which were not otherwise of great importance; that
   they might learn to observe precisely, and with the most exact care,
   whatever the Law commanded, and that they should not obtrude anything
   of themselves, inasmuch as the purity of the holy things was corrupted
   by the very smallest invention. He would, therefore, leave nothing to
   the people's judgment, but directed them by a fixed rule even in the
   most trifling matters. As to the burnt-offerings, he commands that they
   should not be taken away from the altar till they were consumed by the
   fire; but after they were put on, he commands them to be burnt in a
   constant fire till the morrow. With this intent, he expressly says,
   that the fire should be kept alight on the altar all the night, since
   the sacrifices would not have been reduced to ashes without the
   application of fuel. Secondly, he commands the priest, clothed in the
   linen garment, and breeches, as he was wont to be in the performance of
   his sacred duties, to go to the altar, and to take away the ashes and
   put them by the side, or at some part of the altar; but when he shall
   have gone away from the altar, he bids him take off his holy garments,
   and carry the ashes out of the camp to a clean place. But what he had
   before briefly adverted to as to the supply of wood, he immediately
   declares more fully to be, lest the fire should go out. Again, he
   assigns to the priest the office of setting the wood in order every
   morning. But, because in the sacrifices [275] of prosperities the Law
   commanded the fat only to be burnt, Moses now adds, verse 12, that the
   fat was to be burnt on the same fire. It is worthy of particular
   observation, that he finally subjoins a precept as to so keeping up the
   fire that it may never go out.

   The intent of this perpetuity was, that the offerings should be burnt
   with heavenly fire; for on the day that Aaron was consecrated, the
   sacrifice was reduced to ashes not by human means but miraculously, in
   token of approbation. True that God did not choose daily to exert this
   power; but He interposed the hand and labor of men in such a manner
   that the origin of the sacred fire should still be from heaven. The
   same thing afterwards happened at the dedication of Solomon's temple,
   because that alteration of the divine decree demanded a sign
   (tesseram,) lest any should think that it was at the will of man that
   the splendor of the temple should outvie the tabernacle. Finally, the
   sacrifice of Elijah was graced by the same privilege when he restored
   the abolished legal service; and then also God upheld what He had
   ordained in His Law, in opposition to all corrupt and degenerate rites.
   Meanwhile, in order to prevent any adulterations, He chose to have the
   fire continually burning on the altar day and night, nor was it
   allowable to take it from elsewhere. There was, indeed, amongst the
   Persians [276] a perpetual fire, and at Rome also under the
   guardianship of the Vestal virgins; [277] and it may be, that in
   foolish mimicry they transferred to themselves the custom which they
   had heard of being observed by the Jews; for thus it is that, for the
   purpose of deceiving unbelievers, the devil often falsely makes a
   pretense of something divine, and imitates God just as an ape imitates
   man: but the purpose of God in rejecting strange fire was to retain the
   people in His own genuine ordinance prescribed by the Law, lest any
   inventions of men should insinuate themselves; for the prohibition of
   strange fire was tantamount to forbidding men to introduce anything of
   their own, or to add to the pure doctrine of the Law, or to decline
   from its rule. Meanwhile, since God had once testified, as if by
   stretching forth His hand from heaven (to receive them, [278] ) that
   the sacrifices were acceptable to Him, believers were confirmed in
   their confidence of this by the pledge of the perpetual fire.

   14. And this is the Law of the meat-offering. We have already seen that
   there were various kinds of this offering; now, the cakes or wafers are
   omitted, [279] and mention is only made of uncooked flour, whereof God
   commands that the priest should burn on the altar as much as his hand
   could hold. But this law was necessary in order that believers might be
   fully assured that God was propitiated by the due offering of this
   part, and that none might complain because the greater portion remained
   with the priests. Lest, however, the dignity of the sacrifice should be
   impaired, it was only permitted to the priests to make unleavened bread
   of it, which they were to eat in the sanctuary, as we have seen
   elsewhere. The meat-offering of the priests is excepted, which I
   conceive to be for two reasons, -- first, that the excellency and
   dignity of their gift, honored as it was by special privilege, might
   stimulate the priests to greater efforts of piety, so as not to
   exercise themselves in God's service in a common and perfunctory
   manner; secondly, that they might be thus restrained from the
   affectation of offering it too frequently. For if it only cost them a
   little flour, a door was opened to vain ostentation; they would have
   never ceased offering their [280] minha, the profit of which returned
   to themselves; perhaps they might even have made a trade of it, as we
   see the Popish sacrificers entice the simple populace to profuse
   expenditure in offerings by the pomp of their fictitious devotion.
   Lest, therefore, they should cause their immoderate oblations to
   minister both to their vainglory and avarice, God willed that their
   meat-offering should be entirely consumed.

   25. Speak unto Aaron. We everywhere see how carefully God provided that
   the people should have no doubts about anything. And assuredly true
   religion is distinguished from false imaginations by this peculiar
   mark, that God Himself prescribes what is to be done. Nor can
   certainty, though religion ought to be based upon it, be derived
   elsewhere than from His own mouth. Now, because there was a difference
   between burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, it would have been natural
   to kill them separately in different, places, unless the error had been
   anticipated; but all doubt, is removed when God assigns the same place
   to them both. Whence, too, we gather that one law suffices for the
   proper worship of God, if men are not wise in their own conceits, but
   depend on His mouth. For how came it to pass that, whilst these two
   kinds of oblations differed from each other, the rule respecting them
   was the same on this point, except because it so pleased God? This
   passage, therefore, sufficiently reminds us with how great
   sober-mindedness and modesty it becomes us to follow what is pointed
   out to us in God's word. A reason, however, is at the same time added,
   which may invite reverence to be paid to the sin-offerings, when
   especial sanctity is attributed to them, which, according to the idiom
   of the Hebrew language, is called "holiness of holinesses." Moreover,
   Moses begins to distinguish between cht'h, chateah, [281] and 'sm,
   asham, which the Latins translate peccatum, and delictum, though he had
   before used them indifferently to express the same thing. What the
   difference was, I confess, I know not; I see the guesses of others, but
   nothing certain.

   30. And no sin-offering. The exception is repeated both with reference
   to the sacrifices mentioned in the fourth chapter, and also to the
   solemn sacrifice, whereby the priest and the people were reconciled
   every year: for private persons individually atoned for their sins at
   less expense, and only the greater altar, which stood in the court, was
   sprinkled with blood; but if the priest reconciled God to the whole
   people, or to himself, in order that the intercession might be more
   efficacious, he entered the sanctuary to pour out blood on the opposite
   side of the veil. God now again commands that such victims should be
   entirely burnt. This passage, then, is nothing but a confirmation of
   the others in which a like command is given. Hence the Apostle, in an
   apt allusion, infers that the distinction of meats is abolished; for he
   says that the minor altar, which under the Law was hidden, is now laid
   open to us, (Hebrews 13:10,) and therefore we no longer eat of the
   legal sacrifices; yea, forasmuch as our One Priest has brought His
   blood into the sanctuary, it only remains for us to go forth with Him
   without the camp.

   Leviticus 7:1-5

   1. Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.

   1. Ista autem est lex hostiae pro delicto: sanctificatio
   sanctificationum est.

   2. In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the
   trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about
   upon the altar.

   2. Quo in loco mactabunt hostiam holocausti, mactabunt hostiam pro
   delicto, et sanguinem ejus sparget super altare per circuitum.

   3. And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat
   that covereth the inwards,

   3. Totum vero adipem ejus offeret ex ea, caudam, et adipem operientem
   intestina.

   4. And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it
   shall he take away:

   4. Duos quoque renes, et adipem qui est super illos qui est prope ilia,
   et fibram super jecur, cum renibus removebit.

   5. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made
   by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

   5. Adolebitque illa sacerdos super altare oblationem ignitam Jehovae:
   oblatio pro delicto est.


   1. Likewise this is the law. I have just confessed that I do not
   sufficiently understand how these two words, cht'h, chateah, and 'sm,
   asham, differ from each other; and I have therefore followed the sense
   which is commonly received, and called them the sin and the
   trespass-offering, (hostiam pro peccato vel pro delicto.) Although in
   this second kind of offering he commands the same ceremony to be
   observed as in the former one, yet he mentions some things which he had
   before omitted, such as the sprinkling of blood around the altar, the
   offering of the fat, kidneys, etc., which had not been before
   expressed. The sum amounts to this, that they were to sacrifice in the
   same manner, and with the same rites for sin as for trespass, and make
   not the smallest alteration in the rule laid down for them.

   Leviticus 7

   Leviticus 7:11-18

   11. And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
   shall offer unto the LORD.

   11. Haec autem est lex sacrificii prosperitatum, quod offerer Jehovae.

   12. If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
   sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
   unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of
   fine flour, fried.

   12. Si pro gratiarum actione obtulerit illud, tune offerer pro
   sacrificio gratiaram actionis, placentas infermentatas versatas in
   oleo, et lagana infermentata uncta oleo, et similam frictam una cum
   placentis illis versaris in oleo.

   13. Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
   with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

   13. Cron placentis panis fermentati offeret oblationem suam pro
   sacrificio gratiarum actionis prosperitatum suarum.

   14. And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave
   offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth
   the blood of the peace offerings.

   14. Offeretque ex eo unum panem, ex omni oblatione oblationem Jehovae.

   15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
   thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
   not leave any of it until the morning.

   15. Caro autem hostiae gratiarum actionis prosperitatum ejus, in die
   oblationis ejus comedetur: non relinquet ex eo usque mane.

   16. But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
   offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
   sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

   16. Quod si votum, vel spontaneum fuerit sacrificium oblationis ejus,
   die quo ille obtulerit sacrificium suum, comedetur, et sequenti die
   comedetur quod superfuerit ex co.

   17. But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
   shall be burnt with fire.

   17. Quodvero superfuerit de carne sacrificii die tertia, igni
   comburetur.

   18. And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be
   eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall
   it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination,
   and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

   18. Si autem comedendo comedatur aliqnid de carne sacrificii
   prosperitatum ejus die tertia, non placebit offerens illud, neque
   imputabitur illi, abominatio erit: et anima comedens ex eo iniquitatem
   suam portabit.

   Leviticus 22:29, 30

   29. And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD,
   offer it at your own will.

   29. Quum vero sacrificaveritis sacrificium gratiarum actionis Jehovae,
   in acceptationem vestri sacrificabitis.

   30. On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
   until the morrow: I am the LORD.

   30 Die ipsa comedetur: non relinquetus usque mane ex eo; ego Jehova,


   Leviticus 19

   Leviticus 19:5-8

   5. And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye
   shall offer it at your own will.

   5. Et quando sacrificaveritis sacrificium prosperitatum Jehovae, in
   acceptationem vestri sacrificabitis illud.

   6. It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and
   if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.

   6. Die quo sacrificaveritis comedetur, et postridie: quod autem
   superfuerit usque ad diem tertium, igni comburetur.

   7. And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
   shall not be accepted.

   7. Quod si comedendo comedatur die tertio, profanum erit, neque
   placebit.

   8. Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because
   he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be
   cut off from among his people.

   8. Et qui comederit illud, poenam iniquitatis suae portabit: quia
   sanctitatem Jehovae polluit: et excidetur anima ipsa e populis suis.


   Leviticus 7:11. And this is the law of the sacrifice. I have elsewhere
   [282] stated my reasons for calling this kind of sacrifice "the
   sacrifice of prosperities." That they were offered not only in token of
   gratitude, but when God's aid was implored, is plain both from this and
   other passages; yet in all cases the Jews thus testified that they
   acknowledged God as the author of all good things, whether they
   returned thanks for some notable blessing, or sought by His aid to be
   delivered from dangers, or whether they professed in general their
   piety, or paid the vows which they had made simply and without
   condition; for the payment of a conditional vow was an act of
   thanksgiving. At any rate, since in all they honored God with His due
   service, they gave proof of their gratitude. Hence this name was justly
   given to these sacrifices, because in them they either besought good
   success of Him, or acknowledged that what they had already obtained was
   owing to His grace, or asked for relief in adversity, or congratulated
   themselves on their welfare and safety. Moses, however, distinguishes
   one kind, as it were, from the others:, i.e., the sacrifice of
   thanksgiving, whereby they professedly returned thanks for some notable
   deliverance, which was not; always offered. [283] In this case he
   commands unleavened cakes fried in oil, wafers seasoned with oil, and
   fine flour fried to be offered, together with leavened bread; and also
   commands that the flesh of the sacrifice should be eaten on the day of
   the oblation, so that none should be left. In vows and
   free-will-offerings greater liberty is conceded, viz., that they might
   eat the residue on the next day, provided they kept nothing till the
   third day. In the passage which I have inserted from chapter 22, the
   words I have translated "unto your acceptance," might also be rendered
   "unto His good-will," (in beneplacitum,) for the gratuitous favor of
   God is called rtsvn, ratson. The meaning therefore is, if you would
   have your sacrifice accepted by God, take care that none of the flesh
   should remain to the following day. Others, however, understand it of
   man's good-will, as if it were said, "at your own will," or "as it
   shall please you." And I admit, indeed, that the word rtsvn, ratson, is
   sometimes used in this sense; but since in the same chapter [284] it
   can only be taken for God's favor or acceptance, I have preferred
   avoiding a variation; yet I make no objection if any one likes the
   other reading better. But if my readers weigh well the antithesis, when
   it is presently added, that if the flesh should remain beyond the
   proper time [285] the sacrifice would not be pleasing to God, they will
   agree with me. There is, indeed, an apparent discrepancy here, since in
   this way Moses would command the voluntary sacrifice to be eaten on the
   same day, which, however, he does not do. If we prefer understanding it
   of the liberal feelings of men, he will exhort the people cheerfully to
   offer their victims in thanksgiving. I have, however, shewn the meaning
   which I approve of, and thus it will be easy to reconcile these things,
   for God's goodwill does not require this similarity, [286] nor is it
   necessary to observe the same mode of offering that they may be
   grateful; but they are said to offer "unto their acceptance," when they
   intermix no corruption, but offer purely and duly. If the cause of this
   distinction is asked, it is no clearer to me than is the variety
   between the bread and wafers or cakes. It is certain, indeed, that God
   had a reason for dealing more strictly or more indulgently; but to
   inquire now-a-days as to things unknown, and which conduce not at all
   to piety, is neither right nor expedient.

   16. But if the sacrifice of his offering. I have observed a little
   above that it is not a conditional but a simple vow which is here
   meant; because, if a person were under the obligation of a vow, [287]
   his payment was an act of thanksgiving, and thus his sacrifice was
   comprised under the first head. But it would not be without absurdity
   that similar things should be distinguished as if they differed. But
   inasmuch as many made gratuitous vows, Moses combines this kind of
   sacrifice with the free-will-offering, as standing in the same rank. It
   has also been stated that the consecrated meats were not kept too long,
   lest they should become tainted or putrified, and thus religion should
   fall into contempt. Perhaps, too, vainglory was thus provided against;
   for if it had been allowable to eat the meats salted, many would have
   made ostentatious offerings without expense. God, therefore, imposed a
   restraint, that they might offer their sacrifices more sparingly and
   reverently. The penalty is added, that; the sacrifice would not be
   acceptable to God, but rather abominable; and hence all who ate of them
   would be guilty. Moreover, when Moses says that polluted sacrifices
   would not be "imputed," we may infer that those which are duly offered
   come into account before God, so that He reckons them as things
   expended for Himself. Still we must not, imagine them to be merits
   which lay Him under obligation; but because He deigns to deal so
   liberally with us, that no duty which we pay Him is useless.

   Leviticus 7

   Leviticus 7:19-25, 28-31, 37, 38

   19. And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
   it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean
   shall eat thereof.

   19. Et caro quae contigerit ullum immundum, non comedetur, sed igni
   comburetur: at cames illas omnis mundus comedet.

   20. But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
   offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him,
   even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

   20. Nam anima quae comederit carnes de sacrificio prosperitatum quod
   est Jehovae, et immunditia ejus fuerit super ipsum, tunc excidetur
   anima illa e populis suis.

   21. Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
   uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
   thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which
   pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

   21. Anima item quum tetigerit quicquam immundum, nempe de immunditia
   hominis, aut animal immundum, aut onme reptile immundum, comederitque
   de carnibus sacrificii prosperitatum, quod est Jehovae, tunc excidetur
   anima illa e populis suis.

   22. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   22. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   23. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner
   of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

   23. Alloquere fllios Israel dicendo: Omnem adipem boris, et agni, et
   caprae, non comedetis.

   24. And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that
   which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall
   in no wise eat of it.

   24. Adeps quidem cadaveris, et adeps rapti parabitur in omne opus, sed
   comedendo non comedetis illum.

   25. For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
   offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall
   be cut off from his people.

   25. Nam quicunque comederit adipem animalis ex quo offeret oblationem
   ignitam Jehovae: tunc anima quae comederit excidetur e populis suis.

   28. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   28. Loquutus est insuper Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   29. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the
   sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation
   unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

   29. Loquere ad rilles Israel, dicendo, Offerens sacrificium
   prosperitatum sunrum Jehovae, afferes oblationem suam Jehovae de hostia
   prosperitatum suarum.

   30. His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
   the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be
   waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

   30. Manus ejus afferent oblationes ignitas Jehovae, adipem cum
   pectusculo afferet, pectusculum quidem ad agitandum illud agitatione
   coram Jehova.

   31. And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: ...

   31. Adolebit vero sacerdos adipem super altare.

   37. This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of
   the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
   consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;

   37. Haec est lex holocausti minhae, et sacrificii pro peccato, et
   sacrificii pro delicto, et consecrationum, et sacrificii prosperitatum:

   38. Which the LORD commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he
   commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the
   LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

   38. Quam praecepit Jehova Mosi in monte Sinai, die quo praecepit filiis
   Israel ut offerrent oblationes suas Jehovae in deserto Sinai.


   19. And the flesh that toucheth. It was not indeed lawful to eat of any
   polluted flesh, but in the sacrifices there was a special reason for
   this, i.e., because the uncleanness involved sacrilege. On this account
   he commands it to be burnt, just like that which had not been consumed
   within the legitimate time; and the punishment is, [288] that if any
   unclean person shall have touched the consecrated meat, he should be
   cut off from the people. The cruelty or immoderate severity of this has
   induced some to think that to be "cut off" is nothing more than to be
   cast out of the camp. But it is not wonderful that God should have thus
   severely dealt with those who knowingly and wilfully contaminated what
   was holy; for if any one had sinned in error, he was not to receive
   this sentence, but only he who had betrayed his open contempt of God by
   impious profanation of sacred things.

   23. Speak unto the children of Israel. Since in all sacrifices the fat
   was consecrated to God, and was burnt on the altar, God forbade His
   people to eat fat even in their ordinary meals, in order that they
   might cultivate piety even in their homes. For unquestionably this was
   an exercise of piety, that they who were far away from the temple
   should still accustom themselves in their daily meals to the service of
   God. Nor am I ignorant of the allegories [289] in which some
   interpreters indulge, but I willingly acquiesce in the reason which God
   reveals, viz., that the people was prohibited from eating fat, because
   He had assigned it to Himself. Nevertheless, the Law permits the fat of
   a carcase, [290] or of an animal torn (by beasts) to be applied to any
   use, provided they abstain from the fat of those animals which might be
   legally offered.

   37. This is the law of the burnt-offering. In this conclusion Moses
   indicates that full provision had been made lest any addition should
   insinuate itself from man's inventions to vitiate the sacrifices. In
   the day, he says, that God appointed the sacrifices to be offered to
   Him on Mount Sinai, He omitted nothing which was to be observed, lest
   men should dare to introduce anything except what He prescribed. And
   surely, when He had thus carefully embraced all the ceremonies, we may
   easily infer from hence how earnestly we should avoid all temerity and
   audacity in invention. The design, therefore, of Moses was in this
   brief admonition to exhort the people to soberness, lest they should
   transgress the limits placed by God.

   Numbers 15

   Numbers 15:1-16

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
   come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,

   2. Loquere ad filios Israel, et dicas els, Quum ingressi fueritis
   terraim habitationum vestrarum quas ego daturus sum vobis:

   3. And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering,
   or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in
   your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd,
   or of the flock:

   3. Et facere voletis oblationem ignitam Jehovae holocaustum vel
   sacrificium, ut solvatis votum aut sponte vestra, ant in solennitatibus
   vestris, ut faciatis odorem quietis Jehovae de bobus aut ex pecudibus:

   4. Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat
   offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an
   hin of oil.

   4. Tunc offeret offerens oblationem suam Jehove pro minha similae
   decimam partem mistam cum quarta parte olei.

   5. And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
   thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

   5. Et vini pro libamine quartam partem hin facies super holocaustum,
   aut ultra sacrificium pro agno uno.

   6. Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals
   of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

   6. Aut pro ariete facies minham similae duas decimas permistae cum olci
   tertia parte hin.

   7. And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin
   of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   7. Et vini pro libamine tertiam partem hin offeretis in odorem quietis
   Jehovah.

   8. And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
   sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:

   8. Quod si facere voles juveneum in holocaustum, aut sacrificium ad
   solvendum votum, aut sacrificia prosperitatum Jehovae:

   9. Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
   deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

   9. Offeres una cum juvenco minham, similae tres decimas permistae cum
   olei dimidia parte hin.

   10. And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for
   an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

   10. Et vinum offeres pro libamine dimidiam partem hin: oblationem
   ignitam odoris quietis Jehovae.

   11. Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
   lamb, or a kid.

   11. Sic facies bovi uni, aut arieti uni, aut foetui tam de ovibus quam
   de capris.

   12. According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
   every one according to their number.

   12. Juxta numerum quem facietis singulis juxta numerum illorum.

   13. All that are born of the country shall do these things after this
   manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
   the LORD.

   13. Omnis civis lacier sic ista ut offerat oblationem odoris quietis
   Jehovah.

   14. And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
   your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet
   savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

   14. Et quum peregrinatus fuerit apud vos peregrinus, aut quicunque est
   in medio vestri per generationes vestras, feceritque oblationem ignitam
   odoris quietis Jehovae, quemadmodum facietis sic faciet.

   15. One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also
   for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in
   your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.

   15. O congregatio, statutum unum erit vobis et peregrino qui
   peregrinatur apud vos: statutum inquam perpetuum per generationes
   vestras: sicut vos sic et peregrinus erit coram Jehova.

   16. One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that
   sojourneth with you.

   16. Lex una et norma una erit vobis et peregrino qui peregrinatur apud
   vos.


   1. And the Lord spake. He partly here adverts to those precepts of
   which he had treated more distinctly and fully in Leviticus, and partly
   gathers into one place what he had before spoken of in various places
   and more obscurely. For as yet he had delivered no certain regulations
   as to the accessories to the meat-offering of oil and wine; but what he
   had before appropriated to particular cases he now commands to be
   observed generally, and what he had treated of more accurately he now
   lightly passes over; for he does not enter into full particulars, but
   only forbids that sacrifices should be offered without flour, a
   libation of wine, and oil. We have seen elsewhere that in the
   sacrifices and oblations, wherein God consulted the rude condition of
   the people, He took as it were the character of a man, as if He feasted
   there familiarly with them. In this sense He elsewhere calls the
   sacrifices His meat, [291] not because He, who is the life in Himself
   and inspires the life of all, requires the supports of life, but
   because, unless He descends to men, He cannot lift up their minds to
   things above. Still, inasmuch as there was danger on the other side
   lest the people should introduce many inane and superfluous pomps, as
   we see that in their sacred feasts the Gentiles were foolishly and
   immoderately luxurious, as if their delicacies gave pleasure to God,
   the measure of each particular thing is prescribed, that they may not
   dare to invent anything arbitrarily. The conjecture is probable that
   what had been before delivered with sufficient clearness is here again
   recalled to their memory. But since this reason is not expressly given,
   it will be enough to hold fast what has been frequently stated, that
   although the ceremonies might be of trifling importance, still it was
   necessary that the lawful should be carefully distinguished from the
   unauthorized, in order that the licentiousness of men might be
   anticipated, who would otherwise have failed not to mingle their own
   leaven. The sum of this passage is, that both in the solemn sacrifices
   which the Law demands, as well as in the free-will-offerings, they
   should observe that proportion of which we have treated elsewhere.

   14. And if a stranger sojourn with you. He does not mean all strangers,
   but only those who, descending from heathen nations, had professedly
   turned to God, and thus had been received into the body of the Church;
   for the uncleanness of those who remained in uncircumcision excluded
   them from the legal service. I conceive that there were two reasons why
   God would have one and the same form observed; first, that the
   proselytes who had been lately incorporated might more cheerfully
   devote themselves to the exercises of piety, when they saw themselves
   placed in the same position as the children of Abraham; and secondly,
   lest if any distinction should be made, corrupt mixtures should
   immediately creep in. Lest, therefore, the purity of God's worship
   should be gradually corrupted by absurd imitation, the gate was shut
   against that variety which usually draws men aside in different
   directions.

   Leviticus 22:17-25

   17. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   17. Loquutus est praeterea Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   18. Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of
   Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or
   of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his
   vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto
   the LORD for a burnt offering;

   18. Alloquere Aharon et filios ejus, et omnes filios Israel et dicas
   illis, Quit. unque e domo Israelis, et e peregrinis Israel obtulerit
   oblationem suam pro omnibus votis suis, et pro omnibus oblationibus
   spontaneis suis, quae obtulerit Jehovae in holocaustum;

   19. Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
   beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

   19. In acceptationem vestri offeretis immaculatum masculum ex bobus, ex
   agnis, et ex capris.

   20. But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
   shall not be acceptable for you.

   20. Omne in quo fuerit macula non offeretis: quia non erit in
   acceptationem pro vobis.

   21. And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD
   to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it
   shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

   21. Vir autem quum obtulerit sacrificium prosperitatum Jehovae, ad
   solvendum votum, vel ad voluntarie offerendum, ex bobus, vel ex ovibus
   immaculatum erit in aeceptationem, nullum vitium erit in eo.

   22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
   scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering
   by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

   22. Caecum aut fractum, aut concisum labiis, aut verrucatum, vel
   scabiosum, vel impetiginosum, non offeretis ista Jehovae: neque
   oblationem ignitam dabitis ex his super altare Jehovae.

   23. Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or
   lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;
   but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

   23. Bovem quidem et pecus superfluum aut diminutum, pro oblatione
   voluntaria facies: at pro voto non placebit.

   24. Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed,
   or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your
   land.

   24. Concussum et contusum, ruptum et excisum non offeretis Jehovae: in
   terra vestra non facietis.

   25. Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God
   of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be
   in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

   25. De mann autem alienigenae non offeretis panem Dei vestri, ex
   omnibus istis: quia corruptio eorum est in ipsis: macula est in els:
   non acccpta erunt pro vobis.


   Deuteronomy 17

   Deuteronomy 17:1

   1. Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock or sheep,
   wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination
   unto the LORD thy God.

   1. Non sacrificabis Jehovae Deo tuo bovem, aut agnum, in quo fuerit
   macula, aut quidpiam vitii, quia abominatio Jehovae Dei tui est.


   Leviticus 22:17. And the Lord spake. He now more clearly teaches and
   more copiously inculcates what he has frequently adverted to
   heretofore, that it is sinful to offer to God a maimed, or weak, or
   otherwise imperfect animal. Now this external soundness admonished the
   ancient people that God is served amiss when He is served by halves,
   since He abominates a double heart. [292] (Proverbs 11:20.) At the same
   time, in this symbol was shewn forth the perfect purity of that victim
   by which God was at length to be reconciled. We know in how great
   liberties the world indulges itself in the service of God; for whilst
   it lightly and contemptuously obtrudes mere trifling upon Him as if He
   were a child, it still fancies that its duty is properly discharged.
   Hence it is that it claims reward for any rubbish (sordibus,) and
   exults in mere mockeries of God, as if it were laying Him under
   obligation. A notable example of this stupid security is seen
   now-a-days in the Papacy, when they mock God with no less audacity than
   as if they were dealing with a block of wood. To omit innumerable other
   cases, what can be more monstrous than this arrogance of theirs, when,
   as they mutter their prayers, their minds wander not only into
   frivolous but even into unholy imaginations, and yet they pretend that
   the final intention, as they call it, is meritorious and approved by
   God? [293] Suppose a priest (sacrificus) shall have proposed to recite
   the godly prayers of his breviary, and, when scarcely three words have
   been said, his mind shall be occupied with dishes, shall run away now
   to his cups, now to dicing, or other pastimes, still, as if his task
   were performed, he will boast that he has offered worship to God. In
   order, therefore, to obviate this fault, God commands that sacrifices
   free from all blemish should be presented to Him. Hence that sharp
   expostulation of His in Malachi 1:7, 8, because the Jews polluted His
   altar and thought His table contemptible, when they said that their
   blind, and lame, and sick victims were not evil. "Offer it now (he
   says) to thy governor, will he -- accept thy person?" not because God
   cared for the fatness or the juiciness of the animals, but because it
   thus was made plain that true piety was neglected, nay, altogether
   despised. We perceive, then, that all defective sacrifices were
   rejected, that the Israelites might learn sincerely and seriously to
   consecrate themselves entirely to God, and not to play childishly with
   Him, as is often the case. Elsewhere we have seen indeed that all
   uncleanness is repudiated by God; but we must remember that two things
   are required for legitimate worship; first, that he who approaches God
   should be purged from every stain, and secondly, that he should offer
   nothing except what is pure and free from all imperfection. What
   Solomon says, that "the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to
   the Lord," (Proverbs 15:8,) is true, although it be fat and splendid.
   But in order that the things which are offered by the good should be
   pleasing to God, another point must also be attended to, viz., that the
   offering should not be poor, and stingy, and deficient; and again, by
   this symbol, as I have already said, they were directed to Christ,
   besides whom no integrity will anywhere be found which will satisfy
   God.

   19. "Unto your acceptance." [294] Some indeed translate this "at your
   own will," but the context forbids it; for Moses sometimes uses the
   word rtsh, ratseh, which means "accepted," in the same sense, and
   sometimes rtsvn, ratson, which can only be referred to God's favor,
   which is commonly called His "good pleasure." Again, as he here uses
   the compound word lrtsnkm; leretsoncem, so he soon afterwards adds
   lrtsvn lkm, leretson lecem, where he declares that a blemished
   sacrifice would not be "unto their acceptance," because it would be
   rejected by God. The sum therefore is, that if they desire their
   oblations to be approved by God, they must beware that there be no
   defect in them. Still, if any one chooses to think that God's
   gratuitous favor is expressed by the word "good pleasure," I willingly
   admit it, since our services only please God in so far as in His
   paternal indulgence He deigns to award to them the value of which they
   are by no means worthy. Nevertheless let us learn meanwhile that we
   must not play with God, but that He must be so worshipped in integrity
   and sincerity of heart as that our sacrifices may correspond with His
   good pleasure. For hence arises the careless profanation of His
   worship, because we do not sufficiently consider what is due to His
   perfection. It is indeed certain that nothing can proceed from us which
   is pure in every respect; but let us at least aspire at what befits us,
   and let us mourn that our desires fall so far short of their aim, in
   order that Christ may by His grace supply what is wanting in US; for it
   is unquestionable that, provided our sacrifices are the fruits of true
   regeneration, He washes out their blemishes with His own blood.

   22. Either a bullock, or a lamb, that hath anything superfluous. An
   exception is here stated as to free-will-offerings; for in them God
   does not refuse a diminutive animal, or one which has a member either
   contracted, or of excessive size. And doubtless a greater license ought
   to be given, when a person is not under the obligation either of a vow
   or any other necessity. Still we must remember that no victim is
   acceptable to God, which labors under any notable defect.

   25. Neither from a stranger's hand. God here forbids that victims of
   this sort should be offered to Him, although they might be purchased
   from foreigners. The Hebrews, however, has invented a different
   meaning, viz., that not even from foreigners were such sacrifices to be
   received, as it was unlawful for the children of the Church themselves
   to offer. But inasmuch as the Law altogether prohibited the unclean
   nations from making sacred oblations, another solution of this
   difficulty was still to be discovered. [295] They suppose, therefore,
   that those are called "strangers," who observe the precepts of the
   children of Noah, i.e., who honor God, and do not pollute themselves by
   incest, abstain from the effusion of human blood, and from theft, and
   who do not worship idols. But the context does not accord with this,
   for Moses adds at the end that this kind of sacrifice would not be
   accepted by God from the Jews themselves, which will not agree with
   their being offered by the Gentiles. This, then, seems to me to be a
   confirmation of the previous injunction, introduced by way of
   precaution; for it might have seemed that the offering would have been
   permissible, if they had purchased the animal, even though it were
   defective; whereas God declares that what they were not allowed to
   present from their own stalls, was no more approved of by Him, if it
   had been purchased, because defectiveness is always displeasing to Him.
   Nor do I restrict this, as they do, to the foregoing clause, as if it
   only referred to castrated animals, and such as were wounded in the
   testicles, but I include with it also warts and eruptions, and other
   blemishes. In order that the prohibition may have more weight, he again
   calls the sacrifices "the bread of God," not because God, who is the
   fountain of life, has need of food, or eats of corruptible meat, since
   He is the eternal Spirit; but that men may more diligently take care
   duly to perform their sacred rites, wherein they familiarly draw nigh
   to God. Now, if no one would dare to present stale or corrupted food to
   an earthly prince, much less tolerable is it to contaminate God's table
   with anything blemished.

   [292] A. V., "They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the
   Lord." The word qs, however, says Cocceius, quoted in Taylor's
   Concordance, "expresseth the character of a man who walketh in a double
   way," etc.

   [293] "Wherefore the schoolmen grossly err when they lay it down that
   actual attention, as they call it, is not required in our prayers, but
   that it is sufficient for us to give virtual attention, as they say,
   since our hearts, they affirm, are not in our own power; and hence it
   is enough if, at the commencement, we resolve to wish to pray to God."
   -- Petr. Mart. Loci Com. C1. 3 chap. 13:11. Luther ridicules this mode
   of praying in his "Simplex Orandi Modus," (Witteb. 1558,) vol. 7:132:
   "Quemadmodum sacrificulus ille rurestris ipsis periculis (precibus?)
   subinde aliena miscebat, ad hunc modum, Deus in adjutorium meum
   intende; (Heus, serve, deme helcia equis.) Domine ad adjuvandum me
   festina; (Vade, famula, mulge vaccas.) Gloria Patri, etc.; (Etiam
   cessas, puer? Dii te perdant, etc.) Tales preculas audivi sub Papatu
   quamplurimas, atque omnes adeo eorum orationes fere ejusmodi fuere."

   [294] A.V. "At your own will," vide supra, p. 370.

   [295] This is S.M.'s solution; and after him Fonseca. Willet. "Some
   understand this (says Bonar) as forbidding them to let a stranger
   supply them with animals for sacrifices, q. d., take it not out of a
   stranger's flock or herd: But this is contrary to practice approved of
   in after days; as when Cyrus gave, and Darius ordered others to supply.
   But the true meaning is evidently that the same rule shall hold in
   regard to a strangers offering as in regard to their own. The stranger'
   may be a proselyte, as ver. 18; or he may be such an one as Cyrus."

   Deuteronomy 23

   Deuteronomy 23:18

   18. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,
   into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are
   abomination unto the LORD thy God.

   18. Non offeres mercedem meretricis, nec pretium canis in domum Jehovae
   Dei tui, pro quocunque voto: quia abominatio Jehovae Dei tui utrumque
   est.


   18. Thou shalt not bring the hire. This command has an affinity to the
   foregoing, for God, rejecting whatever is acquired by illicit and
   filthy traffic, teaches us that the utmost chastity is to be observed
   in sacred things; nor does He only refuse the hire of a whore, but also
   the price of a dog, lest the sanctity of the altar should be polluted
   by any impure oblation. Still the dog seems to be rejected in
   comparison with other animals out of contempt; for it was just as wrong
   to kill a pig as a dog, yet might the price of a pig be offered. The
   dog, therefore, is rejected not only as an unclean animal, but also as
   vile and contemptible. In sum, God would impress upon them the
   reverence due to His temple and altar.

   Leviticus 22:26-28

   26. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   26. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   27. When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it
   shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and
   thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the
   LORD.

   27. Bos, vel agnus, vel capra, quum natus fuerit, erit septem diebus
   sub matre sua, a die autem octavo et deinceps, placebit in oblationem
   sacrificii igniti Jehovae.

   28. And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young
   both in one day.

   28. Bovem autem, vel pecudem, et fillum ejus non mactabitis die una.


   Exodus 22

   Exodus 22:30

   30. Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven
   days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

   30. Erit primogenitum animal septem diebus cum matre sua: die autem
   octavo dabitis illud mihi.


   Exodus 34

   Exodus 34:26

   26. ... Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

   26. Non coques hoedum in lacte matris suae.


   Deuteronomy 14

   Deuteronomy 14:21

   21. ... Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

   21. Non coques hoedum in lacte matris suae.


   Leviticus 22:27. When a bullock or a sheep. God forbids the young to be
   taken from the womb to the altar, not only because this bad example was
   likely to be transferred from the sacrifices to the ordinary food, but
   also because the offering would have been a fraudulent one. We have
   seen that the sacrifices were called the bread of God, in order that
   men should be more liberal with respect to them, and not offer meagre
   victims; but to kill a young animal fresh from the womb would have been
   a sign of contempt; although regard was also had to humanity, lest, by
   eating of such sacrifices, they should grow accustomed to cruelty. The
   eighth day is appointed, on which the lawfulness of the offering should
   commence. I am afraid that the reason which some assign for this is too
   subtle, viz., that an animal is made perfect in seven days, because God
   completed the work of creation in seven days. Besides, on this ground
   the seventh day would be the fittest for sacrifice, because in six days
   God completed all His work, and the seventh was hallowed for His
   service It is enough for me that regard was had to maturity of age,
   just as in the case of circumcision. [296]

   28. And whether it be a cow or ewe. Though cruelty was indeed condemned
   in this precept, still I make no doubt but that Moses speaks primarily
   of the sacrifices. I confess the word scht, shachat, which he uses, is
   a general one; but since throughout the chapter he is professedly
   treating of the sacrifices, and in connection with these words adds the
   conclusion respecting the hallowing of His holy name, ver. 32, the
   context requires that we should consider it to be an inculcation of
   purity in God's service. If any prefer to extend it further, I will not
   contest the point; and thus this sentence will be a supplement to the
   Sixth Commandment. I have, however, followed what appears most
   probable, and the reader of sound judgment will, I hope, agree with me.
   Meanwhile, I confess that all barbarity and cruelty was thus prohibited
   in the sacrifices, and in them the rule was laid down, that men should
   not be cruel in reference to their daily food. It is a sight by no
   means pleasant to gentle minds to see the dam killed together with her
   young; and, if it were a common custom, men would easily grow callous
   as to blood-shedding in general. God would therefore not have the
   exercises of religion disconnected from the duties of humanity; and the
   tendency of the precept is, that God's altar should not be a Cyclopean
   slaughter-house.

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:19

   19. ... Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

   19. Non coques hoedum in lacte matris suae.


   19. Thou shalt not seethe a kid. The threefold repetition of the
   command reminds us that a serious matter is spoken of, whereas it would
   be a light and almost frivolous one, if, as some suppose, it is merely
   the prohibition of a somewhat unwholesome food. But the Jews, not
   considering its intent, and affecting sanctity, as they do, in trifling
   puerilities, dare not taste of cheese together with kid, or lamb's
   flesh, until they have well cleaned their teeth. I have no doubt,
   however, but that this prohibition relates to the sacrifices, for in
   the first passage quoted, it is added in connection with the offering
   of the first-fruits; and in the second, we read as follows: "The first
   of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the
   Lord thy God. Nor shalt thou seethe a kid in his mother's milk;" and so
   also in the third passage: "Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of
   itself, etc., for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God; nor
   shalt thou seethe a kid in his mother's milk." I allow indeed that
   Moses sometimes mixes together precepts respecting different things;
   but this running context shews that this precept is delivered among the
   ceremonies, and must therefore be reckoned to be a part of the legal
   service. Whence I conclude, that the people are not only interdicted
   from eating this sort of food, as if they were to partake of flesh
   steeped in blood; but that they should not pollute the sacrifices by
   the carnal mixture. It is however probable, that meat seasoned with
   milk was accounted a delicacy; but inasmuch as they might grow cruel,
   if they ate of a lamb or kid in its mother's milk, God forbade to be
   offered to Himself, what was not allowable even in their common meals.
   The exposition of some, that kids were excluded from their tables until
   they were weaned, is not agreeable to reason; because they then begin
   to have a goatish flavor. But the reason is a very appropriate one,
   i.e., that God would not admit a monstrous thing in His sacrifices,
   that the flesh of the young should be cooked in its mother's milk, and
   thus, as it were, in its own blood.

   Deuteronomy 12

   Deuteronomy 12:1-3

   1. These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do
   in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess
   it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

   1. Haec sunt statuta et judicia quae custodietis, ut faciatis in terra
   quam daturus est Jehova Deus patrum tuorum tibi, quo possideatis eam
   omnibus diebus quibns vos vivetis super terrain illam.

   2. Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye
   shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the
   hills, and under every green tree:

   2. Destruendo destruetis omnia loca in quibus servierunt gentes quas
   possessuri estis, diis suis, super montes excelsos, et super colles, et
   sub omni arbore frondosa.

   3. And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and
   burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of
   their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

   images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

   52. Destruite omnes statues earum, et omnes imagines confiatiles
   destruite, et omnes aras eorum dissipate.


   Exodus 23:24. Thou shalt utterly overthrow them. I allow indeed that
   these supplements would partly agree with, and be applicable to, the
   First Commandment; but since express mention is everywhere made in them
   of idols, this place seems to be better suited to them. After Moses has
   taught what was necessary to be observed, he adds a political law about
   breaking down altars and overthrowing images, in order that the people
   may take the more diligent heed. These passages, however, differ from
   the foregoing; for in condemning thus far the superstitions which are
   vicious in themselves, God prescribed what He would have observed even
   to the end of the world. He now confirms that instruction by temporary
   enactments, that He may keep His ancient people up to their duty. For
   we have now-a-days no scruples in retaining the temples, which have
   been polluted by idols, and applying them to a better use; since we are
   not bound by what was added consequently (propter consequentiam), as
   they say, to the Law. I admit indeed that whatever tends to foster
   superstition should be removed, provided we are not too rigorously
   superstitious in insisting peremptorily on what is in itself
   indifferent. The sum amounts to this, that to shew more clearly how
   greatly God detests idolatry, He would have the memory of all those
   things abolished which had once been dedicated to idols. The second
   passage more fully unfolds what Moses had briefly adverted to in the
   first; for under the word "image," he included all those tokens of
   idolatry which he afterwards enumerates, and of which he commands the
   whole land to be so cleared that no relics of them should remain. From
   the words, when ye have come into the land "to possess it," Augustin
   [297] sensibly infers, that there is no command for private individuals
   to destroy the instruments of idolatry; but that the people are armed
   and furnished with this authority to take the charge of regulating the
   public interests, when they have obtained possession of the land. The
   third passage is more brief, only enumerating three kinds; the fourth
   adds "graven images," (sculptilia.) The fifth omits the groves, and
   puts in their place images or representations made of molten materials;
   and here we must observe what we have before adverted to, that the name
   of statue (statuoe) is sometimes taken in a good sense; and therefore
   the Jews think that what was permitted to the fathers before the Law is
   now forbidden. To us, however, it seems more probable, that the statues
   now condemned are not such as Jacob erected only as a monument, but
   such as they pretended to be a likeness of God. Some translate the word
   "titles," [298] others "pictures," with what propriety I leave to the
   judgment of my readers. He adds "image," [299] a word which, though not
   in itself sinful, is still deservedly rejected in connection with the
   worship of God. Man is the image of God; for Moses uses this same word,
   when relating the creation of man. But to represent God by any figure,
   before which He is worshipped, is nothing less than to corrupt His
   glory, and so to metamorphose Him. By speaking of molten images, he
   admits neither sculptures nor pictures; but since they are generally
   cast in the precious metals, the people were expressly to beware of
   keeping gods of gold or silver for ornament.

   Deuteronomy 16

   Deuteronomy 16:21

   21. Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar
   of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

   21. Non plantabis tibi lucum quarumvis arborum apud altare Jehovae Dei
   tui, quod facies tibi.


   21. Thou shalt not plant thee. It is plain from the end of this verse
   that it is part of the Second Commandment. We know [300] that amongst
   the heathen nations groves were sacred, so that with them no religious
   object would receive due reverence, except under the shade of trees.
   Wherefore lest conformity with this general custom should vitiate the
   pure worship of God, this distinction was made; and this then is the
   intent of the prohibition, that the Jews should fly from all strange
   rites, lest by too closely approaching the Gentiles, they should
   introduce a sinful medley. But how necessary this prohibition was,
   appears from their eager imitation (of the heathen), of which mention
   is constantly made in the sacred history. For there was scarcely any
   period in which they abstained from "high places." Nor is it without
   reason that Isaiah and Jeremiah reprove them for "playing the harlot
   under every green tree." (Isaiah 57:5; Jeremiah 2:20; 3:6.)

   they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,
   and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

   15. Ne forte percutias foedus cum habitatoribus ejus terrae, ut
   scortentur post deos suos, et sacrificent diis suis: vocet autem to
   quispiam, et comedas e sacrificio ejus.

   16. And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters
   go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after
   their gods.

   16. Et forte accipias e filiabus ejus filiis tuis, et scortentur filiae
   ejus post deos ipsarum, et scortari faciant filios tuos post deos
   earum.


   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:31-33

   31. ... for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;
   and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

   31. Dabo in manum vestram habitatores terrae, et expelles cos a facie
   tua.

   32. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

   32. Non percuties cum ipsis foedus, nec cum diis eorum.

   33. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against
   me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

   33. Non habitabunt in terra tua: ne forte peccare faciant te contra me
   quando colueris deos eorum, quod erit tibi in offendiculum.


   Exodus 34:11. Observe that which I command thee. Although these
   supplements belong alike to the First and Second Commandment, still it
   was fit to postpone them to this place; because in them God applied a
   remedy to all external and manifest superstitions, which might easily
   have insinuated themselves had they not been anticipated in good time.
   All will run eagerly into idolatry, even though there be none to impel
   us from without; but where the ungodly act upon us also like fans, and
   this must needs be the case, when the people of God entangle themselves
   in their society, this disease is increasingly inflamed. And truly the
   closer our familiarity is with them, it is like a yoke, whereby they
   draw others with them. In order then that the people, when they entered
   the land, might preserve themselves pure and thoroughly devoted to God,
   care must be taken lest they should contract pollution from other
   nations; and therefore God would have all the inhabitants of Canaan
   utterly destroyed, lest they should entice His elect people to their
   errors and the worship of false gods. He here interdicts two kinds of
   covenant with them, lest there should be any public or private alliance
   between them; and then commands that all should be slain without mercy.
   As regards the public covenant, it was forbidden for a special cause,
   that the sons of Abraham should mix themselves with the reprobate;
   because they would have thus deprived themselves of the lawful
   inheritance which God had destined for them; nor would the face of the
   land have been renewed by the removal of all defilements. Since then in
   His just judgment God had long ago determined to destroy these nations,
   it was not lawful for the children of Abraham to rescind the divine
   decree, or to make any alteration in it.

   If therefore any one should insist too literally on this passage to
   prove the unlawfulness of making any contract with the ungodly, because
   God forbade it of old, he will not reason soundly, since God does not
   now command us to execute vengeance by putting all the wicked to death;
   nor is a certain country assigned to the Church in which it may dwell
   apart and have dominion. Still I do not deny that what was enjoined
   upon the ancient people, in some degree has reference to us; nay, we
   must carefully remark what I lately adverted to, that those, who
   voluntarily unite themselves with the ungodly, impose as it were a yoke
   on themselves to draw them to destruction. And in fact Paul embraced in
   this comparison all the grounds upon which unbelievers insinuate
   themselves into familiarity with us, to ensnare us by their corrupting
   influence. (2 Corinthians 6:14) As much as possible, therefore, must
   all ties of connection be rather broken, than that by union with God's
   enemies [301] we should allow ourselves to be drawn away from Him by
   their allurements; for they will always be attempting, by all the
   artifices they can, to make a divorce between us and God. Besides, if
   we desire faithfully to serve God, there ought to be a perpetual
   quarrel between us and them. God then would have us not only separate
   ourselves from open communion with them, but since we are too much
   given to depravity, He also commands us to fly from all the snares
   which might gradually induce us to participate in their sins. But
   inasmuch as Paul justly reminds us, that if we are not permitted to
   have any dealings with unbelievers, we must "needs go out of the
   world," (1 Corinthians 5:10,) it is proper for us to distinguish
   between the contracts which associate us with them and those which do
   not at all diminish our liberty.

   As long as we live among unbelievers, we cannot escape those dealings
   with them which relate to the ordinary affairs of life; but if we
   approach nearer, so that a greater intimacy should arise, we open the
   door as it were to Satan. Such are alliances between kings and nations,
   and marriages amongst private persons; and therefore Moses laid down
   rules respecting them both for the ancient people. And although our
   condition now-a-days is more free, still we are warned that all
   temptations are to be avoided which might give occasion to this evil.
   It is notorious that men are too apt to be led away by the
   blandishments of their wives; and also, that men in their power compel
   their wives to obedience. Those, therefore, who mix with idolaters,
   knowingly and wilfully devote themselves to idols. The same thing
   happens as to alliances; for men are ashamed in them to betray any
   marks of disrespect. Thus, to please the king of Syria, Ahaz raised an
   altar in the temple like that at Damascus. (2 Kings 16:10.) Thus while
   the Jews desired to gratify the Assyrians, they imitated their
   superstitions. In a word, it, is a most uncommon case that the religion
   of those should remain unaffected who seek to curry favor with the
   ungodly. But that they may cleave more earnestly to their duty, the
   danger I have spoken of is declared; otherwise such rejoinders as these
   would have been straightway in their mouths: "Although my wife is
   altogether averse from true piety, still I will stand firm; although my
   husband is not subject to God, yet I will never decline from the true
   course; although religion is not dear to our allies, still it shall not
   cease to be sacredly held in honor amongst ourselves." God [302]
   therefore interferes betimes, and declares that they will not be so
   magnanimous in resistance, when once they have opened the window to the
   evil. He adds, too, another evil, i.e., that the sacred land would be
   thus profaned; for, although the Israelites should be separated from
   the impieties of the Gentiles, still it was not excusable to allow them
   to have altars in that land in which God had chosen a sanctuary for
   Himself. Yet at the same time Moses warns them that it could scarcely
   be but that this association would involve the Israelites also. When he
   says, then, "lest they go a whoring after their gods, and one call
   thee," he means that the Israelites would be like panders, if under
   cover of their covenant, and for the sake of preserving their
   good-will, they gave the Gentiles permission to exercise their
   superstitions; and also that this would be a snare to grosser sin;
   since whilst they feared to give offense, they would not refuse to go
   to their feasts, and thus would be partakers of their guilt. Literally,
   it is, "Lest perhaps thou strike a covenant, and they go a whoring
   after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and call thee,"
   which words may be thus paraphrased, so as to depend on the foregoing
   prohibition: "Lest it should happen, after you shall have made a
   covenant, that they should go a whoring," etc.; or thus, "By no means
   make a covenant, because they will go a whoring after their idols, and
   when they shall offer sacrifices will call thee." The meaning, however,
   will amount to the same; for he mentions the two worst results of their
   unlawful covenant, i.e., that these unbelieving nations will pollute
   the land, and under pretext of kindness will corrupt God's people. But
   in order that they may be more earnest and courageous in their duty,
   the promise is added, that they shall be victorious over these nations.
   This was almost incredible, that wanderers and exiles as they were,
   they should easily and quickly be enabled to gain possession of so many
   lands; therefore God takes away all doubt, and thus commands the
   Israelites to obey His dominion at the end of this war, which they
   shall feel that they have waged successfully under His auspices.
   Wherefore he convicts them of ingratitude if they shall dare to relax
   any of that severity which He requires; as if He had said, Since these
   nations far excel you in numbers, and strength, and warlike equipments,
   it will plainly appear that you have not conquered them by your own
   power; it will therefore be more than iniquitous that the war, which
   shall be concluded under my guidance alone, and by my hand, should be
   finished in opposition to my will, and that you should be the disposers
   of that victory which I have gratuitously conferred upon you. The
   discrepancy is easily reconciled, that Moses should only enumerate six
   nations in Exodus, and add a seventh in Deuteronomy; for often he only
   names the Canaanites or Amorites, yet comprising by synecdoche all the
   rest.

   Deuteronomy 7

   Deuteronomy 7:1-4

   1. When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
   goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the
   Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations
   greater and mightier than thou;

   1. Quum introduxerit te Jehova Deus tuus in terram in quam ingrederis
   possidendam, et avellerit gentes multas a facie tua, Hittaeum,
   Gergasaeum, Amorrhaum, Chananaeum, Perisaeum, Hivaeum, et Jebusaeum,
   septem gentes nmltas et robustiores te:

   2. And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt
   smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with
   them, nor shew mercy unto them:

   2. Et tradiderit eas Jehova Deus tuus coram to, et percusseris eas:
   perdendo perdes eas: non inibis cum illis pactum, neque misereberis
   earum.

   3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt
   not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

   3. Non junges te affinitate cum eis, filiam tuam non dabis filio ejus
   et filiam ejus non accipies filio tuo.

   4. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may
   serve other gods; so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you,
   and destroy thee suddenly.

   4. Avocabit enim filium tuum a me, et colent Deos alienos: unde
   irascetur furor Jehovae in vos, ut disperdat te cito.


   2. Thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them. Those who think that
   there was cruelty in this command, usurp too great authority in respect
   to Him who is the judge of all. The objection is specious that the
   people of God were unreasonably imbued with inhumanity, so that,
   advancing with murderous atrocity, they should spare neither sex nor
   age. But we must first remember what we shall see hereafter, i.e., that
   when God had destined the land for His people, He was at liberty
   utterly to destroy the former inhabitants, so that its possession might
   be free for them. We must then go further, and say that He desired the
   just demonstration of His vengeance to appear upon these nations. Four
   hundred years before He had justly punished their many sins, yet had He
   suspended His sentence and patiently borne with them, if haply they
   might repent. That sentence [303] is well known, "The iniquity of the
   Amorites is not yet full." (Genesis 15:16.) After God had shewn His
   mercy for four centuries, and this clemency had increased both their
   audacity and madness, so that they had not ceased to provoke His wrath,
   surely it was no act of cruelty to compensate for the delay by the
   grievousness of the punishment. And hence appears the foul and
   detestable perversity of the human intellect. We are indignant if He
   does not smile at once; if He delays punishment our zeal accuses Him of
   slackness and want of energy; yet, when He comes forth as the avenger
   of guilt, we either call Him cruel, or at least complain of His
   severity. Yet His justice will always absolve Him; and our calumnies
   and detractions will recoil upon our own heads. He commanded seven
   nations to be utterly destroyed; that is to say, after they had added
   sin to sin for 400 years, so that their accumulation was immense, and
   experience had taught that they were obstinate and incurable. It will
   therefore be said elsewhere, that the land "spewed them out,"
   (Leviticus 18:28,) as if it had eased itself, when burdened by their
   filthiness. If impiety is intolerable to the lifeless element, why
   should we wonder that God in His character of Judge exercised extreme
   severity? But if God's wrath was just, He might surely choose whatever
   ministers and executioners of it He pleased; and when He had given this
   commission to His people, it was not unreasonable that He should forbid
   them to pity those whom He had appointed for destruction. For what can
   be more preposterous than for men to vie with God in clemency? and when
   it pleases the Master to be severe, for the servants to assume to
   themselves the right of shewing mercy? Therefore God often reproves the
   Israelites for being improperly merciful. And hence it came to pass
   that the people, whom they ought to have destroyed, became as thorns
   and briars to prick them. (Joshua 23:13, and throughout the book of
   Judges.) Away, then, with all temerity, whereby we would presumptuously
   restrict God's power to the puny measure of our reason; and rather let
   us learn reverently to regard those works of His, whose cause is
   concealed from us, than wantonly criticise them. Especially when He
   declares to us the just grounds of His vengeance, let us learn to
   subscribe to His decrees with the humility and modesty that becomes us,
   rather than to oppose them in vain, and indeed to our own confusion.

   Deuteronomy 7

   Deuteronomy 7:16-26

   16. And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
   deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt
   thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.

   16. Absumesque omnes populos quos Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi: non parcel
   oculus tuus els, nec coles deos eorum, quid laqueus erunt tibi.

   17. If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;
   how can I dispossess them?

   17. Quum dixeris in corde tuo, Plures sunt gentes illae quam ego:
   quomodo potero expellere eas?

   18. Thou shalt not be afraid of them; but shalt well remember what the
   LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

   18. Ne timeas tibi ab eis: recordando recorderis quae fecerit Jehova
   Deus tuus ipsi Plaraoni, et omnibus Aegyptiis;

   19. The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
   wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the
   LORD thy God brought thee out; so shall the LORD thy God do unto all
   the people of whom thou art afraid.

   19. Probationum magnarum quas viderunt oculi tui, et signorum,
   portentorumque, et manus validae, brachiique extenti quo eduxit to
   Jehova Deus tuus: sic faciet Jehova Deus tuus omnibus populis a quorum
   conspectu times tibi.

   20. Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until
   they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

   20. Praeterea crabronem immittet Jehova Deus tuus in cos, donec pereant
   qui superfuerint, et quia absconderint sea facie tua.

   21. Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among
   you, a mighty God and terrible.

   21. Ne paveas a facie eorum: quia Jehova Deus tuus est in medio tui,
   Deus maximus et terribilis.

   22. And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
   little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the
   beasts of the field increase upon thee.

   22. Expelletque Jehova Deus tuus gentes illas a facie tua paulatim
   paulatim: non poteris absumere eas cito, ne multiplicetur contra to
   bestia agri.

   23. But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
   destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

   23. Attamen tradet eas Jehova Deus tuus coram to, et conteret eas
   contritione maxima, donec perdantur ipsae.

   24. And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
   destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to
   stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

   24. Tradetque reges earum in manum tuam, et perdes nomen earum de sub
   coelo: non consistet quisquam coram te, donec perdas cos.

   25. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt
   not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee,
   lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy
   God.

   25. Sculptilia deorum ipsorum combures igni: non concupisces argentum,
   et aurum quae sunt super ca, et capias tibi: ne illaquees to in illo:
   abominatio enim Jehovae Dei tui est.

   26. Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou
   be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou
   shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

   26. Neque introduces abominationem in domum tuam, et sis anathema sicut
   illud: detestando detestaberis illud, et abominando abominaberis illud,
   quia est anathema.


   16. And thou shalt consume all the people. It is plain from the second
   part of the verse wherefore He commands the people of Canaan to be
   destroyed, when He forbids their gods to be worshipped. This precept,
   therefore, corresponds with the others, where He dooms in like manner
   these nations to utter destruction. I now pass over what I have
   explained elsewhere, i.e., that the vengeance which God exercised
   against these obstinate and ten-times lost people cannot be ascribed to
   cruelty. For since 400 years ago it had been said to Abraham that their
   iniquity was not yet full, they could not be treated with severity
   equal to their deserts, when they had so licentiously and wickedly
   abused God's long-suffering. But we must take notice of God's design in
   so particularly enjoining on the Israelites utterly to destroy whatever
   should be found there; for besides that He had once doomed them all to
   the destruction they merited, He would have the land also, in which His
   name was to be invoked, purged from all pollutions. Now, if any of the
   old inhabitants had survived, they would soon have endeavored to revive
   their corruptions, and since the Israelites were otherwise more
   disposed than enough to superstition, they would easily have been
   attracted to the worship of idols. This, then, is the reason why God
   forbids them to shew these people any humanity or clemency, as I have
   reminded you to be clear from the context; for these things stand in
   connection, that they should not spare the nations nor worship their
   gods. The reason which is subjoined, "for it will be a snare or
   stumblingblock to you," must be extended to the whole context, viz.,
   that it would be fatal to the Jews if they should spare the nations
   which would allure them to impiety.

   17 If thou shalt say in thine heart. Since it was a matter of great
   difficulty to destroy such a multitude of men, and despair itself would
   drive them to madness, so that it would be frivolous for the Israelites
   to cut off all hope of mercy, God anticipates their fear, and exhorts
   them to the strenuous execution of His sentence. From whence we gather
   some useful instruction; whenever God commands anything which exceeds
   our power, we must still obey and boldly break through whatever
   obstacles present themselves to impede us. In all arduous matters,
   therefore, let this doctrine come to our aid, that whatever is contrary
   to God's will may easily be annihilated by His almighty power. But
   since terror, presented to our eyes, immediately so lays hold of all
   our senses that we lie as it were torpid, God recalls to the
   recollection of the Israelites what abundant grounds of confidence He
   had supplied them with. For all the miracles He had wrought were so
   many proofs of His invincible power; and hence they should conclude
   that nothing was to be dreaded, provided God should go before them, and
   that, therefore, being assured of victory, they should not descend to
   any treaties.

   20. Moreover, the Lord thy God will send the hornet. Since the
   destruction of their enemies might seem long, if they were only to be
   slain by their hands and weapons, and again, because it was scarcely
   credible that, without defending themselves, they would voluntarily
   stretch forth their own throats, God promises that in another way also
   He would supply the means of their conquest. Therefore, lest the
   Israelites, imagining that their enemies would be prompt and vigorous
   in resistance, should be alarmed or affrighted, God declares that other
   forces should be at hand, for that hornets or other poisonous insects
   should destroy all the fugitives. The same declaration is found in
   Exodus 23; and what God had promised, Joshua relates that He performed.
   (Joshua 24:12.) But inasmuch as these nations were not to be destroyed
   in a moment, lest the people should therefore grow weary or become
   inactive, God anticipates this, and reminds them that this delay would
   be advantageous, for when all the inhabitants were exterminated, the
   wild beasts would occupy the empty land. The prolongation of the war,
   therefore, ought not to trouble them, for by it God provided for His
   people's welfare, since, if the men were speedily destroyed, they
   should have to contend with wild beasts. But though the passage which I
   have quoted from Exodus is similar in terms, yet I have designedly
   placed it under another head; for God here refers to the extermination
   of the Gentile nations with another object, i.e., lest any of the
   ancient pollutions should remain in the land, and lest the Israelites
   should mingle with the ungodly, by whose arts they might at length be
   drawn away to spurious religions.

   25. The graven images of their gods. He again impresses upon them the
   object of the destruction of the nations, but he goes further than
   before. He had before forbidden them to worship their gods. He now
   commands them to consume their graven images with fire, for since the
   people were prone to superstition, such snares might easily have
   alienated them from God's pure worship. Nor does he command them merely
   to melt the gold and silver so as to alter its shape, but he altogether
   interdicts its use, since it would be a contagious plague; for he shews
   how greatly God abominates idols, inasmuch as whosoever should touch
   the materials of which they were molten, would contract pollution and
   become accursed. This great severity might indeed seem to condemn the
   metals which were created for man's use, as if they were impure, and as
   if the perfectness of natural things was liable to be corrupted by man.
   But in this way idolaters would contaminate the sun and moon, when
   falsely regarding them as objects of corrupt worship; and it must be
   answered that the gold and silver itself was by no means polluted by
   this impious abuse; but that, although free from all stain in itself,
   it was polluted in respect to the people. Such was the uncleanness of
   animals, not that they had in themselves any pollution, but because God
   had interdicted their being eaten. The pollution therefore which is now
   mentioned arises from a similar prohibition; for otherwise the ignorant
   people could not be restrained, and hence God would have that to be
   abominable which in itself was pure. Still this was a political
   precept, and only given temporarily to the ancient people; yet we
   gather from it how detestable idolatry is, which even infects the works
   of God themselves with its own filthiness.

   Deuteronomy 25

   Deuteronomy 25:17-19

   17. Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come
   forth out of Egypt;

   17. Memento quid fecerit tibi Amalec in via, quando egressi estis ex
   Aegypto:

   18. How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even
   all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and
   he feared not God.

   18. Quod tibi occurrerit in via, et te in cauda agminis aggressus sit,
   omnium debilium post to, quum esses lassus et fatigatus, et non
   timuerit Deum.

   19. Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest
   from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God
   giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out
   the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

   19. Erit ergo quum dederit requiem Jehova Deus tuus tibi ab omnibus
   inimicis tuis per circuitum, in terra quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi in
   haereditatem ut possideas eam, delebis memoriam Amalec de sub coelo, ne
   obliviscaris.


   17. Remember what Amalek did unto thee. We have elsewhere seen how the
   Amalekites were the first who made a hostile attack upon the people,
   and endeavored to interrupt their journey; and Moses also related the
   sentence of God against them, the execution of which he now enjoins
   upon the people. God then swore that there should be perpetual war
   against them throughout all ages; and, that His threatening might not
   be frustrated, He appoints His people to take vengeance upon their
   great cruelty and impiety. For when the Israelites were inflicting no
   injury nor loss upon them, it was an act of injustice to make war upon
   peaceful persons proceeding, without doing any wrong, to another land.
   But humanity was still more grossly violated by them, inasmuch as they
   did not spare their own kindred, and thus cast away the feelings of
   nature. It is plain from Genesis 36:12, that the Amalekites were the
   descendants of Esau; and hence it follows that they were both sprung
   from the same ancestor, Isaac. It is true that this command seems but
   little in accordance with religion, that the people should retaliate an
   injury done to them. I reply, that they are not stimulated to
   vindictive feelings in these words, but that they are commanded to
   punish the sins of Amalek with the same severity as those of the other
   nations. God appears, indeed, to influence them by private motives when
   He recounts the cruelty shewn by the Amalekites; but we must judge of
   the intention of the Legislator with reference to His nature, for we
   know that no angry or hateful passions can be approved by God; and
   hence it is easy to conclude that the command was such as the people
   might obey with well-regulated zeal. The first origin of the crime is
   specified, viz., because they "feared not God," for this must not be
   taken in its ordinary meaning, but as expressing that they rebelled
   against God as it were deliberately. For the promise given to Abraham
   and Isaac could not be unknown to them; but, since Esau, the founder of
   their race, had fallen from the right of primogeniture, it came to pass
   that they attempted to bring God's covenant to nought out of wicked and
   sacrilegious jealousy; and this is the reason why He unites them with
   the reprobate nations unto the same destruction. The word znv, zineb,
   which means to crop the tail, is equivalent to making an attack on the
   rear, where the baggage and invalids are wont to be placed. [304]

   3. An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the
   LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
   congregation of the LORD for ever:

   3. Non ingredietur Ammonita et Moabita congregationem Jehovae: etiam
   generatione decima non ingredietur congregationem Jehovae usque in
   saeculum.

   4. Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when
   ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam
   the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

   4. Eo quod non exceperint vos cum pane et aqua in via, posteaquam
   egressi estis ex Aegypto, et quod mercede conduxerit adversum te Bileam
   filium Beor de Pethor e Mesopotamia Syriae, ut malediceret tibi.

   5. Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the
   LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the
   LORD thy God loved thee.

   5. Sed noluit Jehova Deus tuus audire Bileam, et convertit Jehova Deus
   tuus tibi maledictionem in benedictionem, quod diligeret to Jehova Deus
   tuus.

   6. Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days
   for ever.

   6. Non quaeres pacem eorum et bonum eorum cunctis diebus tuis, in
   saeculum.

   7. Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt
   not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

   7. Non abominaberis Edoaemum, quia frater tuus est: non abominaberis
   Aegyptium, quia peregrinus fuisti in terra ejus.

   8. The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
   congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

   8. filii qui nascentur eis generatione tertia ingredientur
   congregationem Jehovae.


   3. An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter. As God has lately prohibited
   His people from all connection and alliance with the Canaanitish
   nations, so He now distinguishes between the aliens, and shews upon
   what conditions, and whom they might admit (into the Church. [305] )
   The Moabites and Ammonites He altogether rejects; because they not only
   refused the common rites of humanity to the people, but also took arms
   against them, and even hired Balaam to curse them. They were the
   descendants of Lot, and ought to have embraced the children of Abraham
   as brethren. It was, then, inexcusable barbarity in them to make a
   violent attack upon those who had voluntarily offered them peace; who
   had promised by their messengers that they would make their way without
   injury or wrong; and who finally had besought that a passage might be
   granted them, provided they honestly paid the price of bread and water;
   although doubtless God took vengeance rather on their impiety than
   their cruelty, since they had not only endeavored to make His goodness
   of none effect, but also to annihilate His faithfulness. Since,
   therefore, it was not their fault that the Church did not perish, and
   the effect of His promise fail, whereon the salvation of man was based,
   and this they had done knowingly and wilfully, no wonder that they were
   excluded from the Church.

   4. And because he hired. [306] Although there was a common reason why
   both nations should not be admitted, yet the number of the verb seems
   to be changed designedly, because Balac king of Moab hired Balaam; yet,
   inasmuch as they conspired together, the same crime is justly imputed
   to the Ammonites. Herein indeed their detestable impiety especially
   betrayed itself, that by hiring a mercenary man, to launch the thunders
   of his curse against the people, they sought to overwhelm God by
   magical incantations. Nor did they err through ignorance, since they
   obstinately persevered in their madness until Balaam was confounded
   from heaven. And on this ground it is expressly stated that he was not
   "hearkend unto," but that rather his curses and prayers were "turned
   into a blessing." Hence it appears how awful is the vengeance which
   awaits all who of deliberate malice oppose God's grace and the welfare
   of the Church. Thus now-a-days no stone is left unturned by the
   defenders of the Papacy, whereby they may disturb the course of
   heavenly doctrine, nay, whereby they may altogether silence the Gospel
   if they could.

   Since another reason for this rejection is plainly signified, it is
   foolish in some to attribute this sentence upon them to their origin,
   as if the Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from the Church because
   they sprang from an incestuous connection.

   7. Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite. In order that the punishment
   denounced against the Moabites and Ammonites should be more strongly
   marked, he commands the Edomites and Egyptians to be admitted in the
   third generation; the former, because they derived their origin from
   the same ancestor, Isaac, since they were the descendants of Esau; the
   latter, because they had been their hosts. For hence it was manifest
   that the Ammonites and Moabites had been dis-honored on account of
   their guilt, when not even aliens were thus dealt with. Now, although
   Esau had cut himself off from the prerogative of believers, yet the
   door was again opened to his children, provided they returned to their
   source and origin, and in the humility of faith admitted the
   primogeniture of Jacob, who had been chosen when their father was
   passed by or degraded. But what is meant by this inequality of
   punishment, when the crime was identical? for Edom appeared in arms
   against Israel before Moab, and compelled them to take their journey by
   another way. It did not contend with hired imprecations for Israel's
   destruction, but since, when humbly entreated on the score of their old
   relationship, it had not only refused them a passage, but had advanced
   against them with a great army, it should have been dealt with no less
   severity than Amalek or Ammon. Besides, being connected to them by a
   closer of blood, the Edomites were less excusable in their hostility. I
   find, then, no reason why God shewed greater clemency to them than the
   others whom He treated more severely; except that He wished to shew
   that it depends on His own will to chastise more lightly in some the
   same sins on which He takes more severe vengeance in others; and,
   inasmuch as all are deserving of utter destruction, He justly retains
   in His own hand the free right of sparing whom He will. We must here
   adore His judgments, into the depths of which we cannot penetrate. Nor
   is this inequality a ground for the noisy cavils of the ungodly, as if
   He were inconsistent with Himself, and acted in contradiction to the
   rules of His Law; since in so doing He does not judge in diverse ways,
   but, condemning all alike, indulges whom He pleases, or remits a part
   of their punishment. A question may also arise as to the Egyptians, why
   God lays His people under an obligation to them, because they sojourned
   in their land. For it was barbarous and inhospitable cruelty in them to
   oppress the wretched fugitives who had trusted to their good faith. But
   God here refers to their first reception; as in Isaiah 52:4, where,
   comparing the Egyptians with the Assyrians, He says that the latter
   oppressed them like robbers, whilst the former had ruled over them not
   without a cause, because the people had gone down thither of their own
   accord. Although, therefore, the Israelites had been unworthily
   oppressed by their fierce tyranny, still God would have their old
   kindness acknowledged; since their dearth and famine had been relieved,
   and the refugees were kindly received, when the inhabitants of Canaan
   were perishing of hunger.

   Deuteronomy 17

   Deuteronomy 17:2-5, 7

   2. If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD
   thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the
   sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,

   2. Si inventus fuerit in medio tui, in una portarum tuarum, quas Jehova
   Deus tuus dat tibi, vir sire mulier qui fecerit malum in oculis Jehovae
   Dei tui, ad transgrediendum pactum ejus:

   3. And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the
   sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

   3. Iveritque et coluerit deos alienos: et adoraverit eos, solem aut
   lunam, aut universum exercitum coelorum, quod ego non praecepi:

   4. And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
   diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such
   abomination is wrought in Israel:

   4. Et nuntiatum fuerit tibi, audierisque: tune probe inquires: et ecce,
   si verus et certus fuerit sermo, et facta fuerit abominatio haec in
   Israel:

   5. Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
   committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that
   woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

   5. Educes virum illum, aut mulierem illam, qui commiserunt facinus
   illud pravum ad portas tuas, virum, aut mulierem, et obrues cos
   lapidibus donec moriantur.

   7. The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
   death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the
   evil away from among you.

   7. Marius testium primo erit in eum ad occidendum ipsum, et manus
   populi postea: exterminabisque malum e medio tui.


   2. If there be found among you. The same punishment is here decreed
   against idolaters, to which apostates had been before condemned; and
   thus either transgression is declared a capital crime. Hence we gather
   that it is accounted before God no less weighty a sin to violate His
   worship by gross and impure superstitions, than openly and professedly
   to fall away from religion altogether. Thus in Ezekiel 20:39, He bids
   farewell to the Jews, and as it were emancipates them, that they may go
   every one after his idols, when they are no longer contented with Him
   alone. Whilst God, however, is so rigid an exactor of punishment, He
   would not have judgment pronounced precipitately. These are tokens of
   severity, that a woman as well as a man is to be slain; that the whole
   people should unite in stoning them; that the evil should be removed
   from the midst of the land, lest the abomination should continue
   unpunished. On the other hand moderation is to be observed, since
   diligent inquiry is to be made, nor is sentence to be pronounced unless
   the matter is fully proved; and again, that the trial may be lawful,
   the accusation of one man is not to convict the accused. God therefore
   would not have the judges, under pretext of zeal, shed blood
   inconsiderately; but only, after mature inquiry, the criminal was to be
   punished in proportion to his transgression. By synecdoche he speaks of
   their cities under the name of "gates," and alludes to the land having
   been "given" them, that they might not shew their want of gratitude to
   God by profaning it. He marks too the heinous nature of the offense, by
   calling it the "transgressing of God's covenant;" as much as to say
   that all who go aside unto idols are covenant-breakers. For the thief,
   and the fornicator, and the drunkard, and such like transgress the Law
   indeed, but still are not placed in this category. In fine, it is not
   simple impiety which is here punished, but the perfidy whereby true
   religion is forsaken, after men have devoted themselves to God, and
   professed themselves to be of the number of His people. The repetition
   of the words "that man or that woman," more fully confirms what I have
   said, viz., that although the weakness of the female sex may extenuate
   their guilt, yet must they not be pardoned in such a case as this,
   where God's worship is directly violated. Although mention is only made
   of the sun, and moon, and stars, the same thing applies to images also;
   nay, inasmuch as it is baser to transfer God's honor to dead stones or
   stocks, than to those constellations in which something divine shines
   forth, so much more detestable are they who plunge themselves into such
   stupidity.

   4. Then three shalt inquire [307] diligently. Although this moderation
   here refers only to the present matter, yet should it always be
   maintained in judicial proceedings, lest innocent persons should be
   treated with undue severity. Again, we must remember what I have said
   elsewhere, that judges are here not only restrained from precipitate
   condemnation, but also stimulated to beware of passing over, in
   idleness or negligence, anything that was necessary to be known. For
   they often fail in their duty, because they wilfully connive at guilt;
   and thus that which would be manifest if they would be at the pains to
   make more diligent inquiry, does not come to light. God, then, would
   not have them slumber nor take no notice of sinister reports, but
   rather inquire diligently as to things which may have come to their
   cars, so that no crime may remain unpunished. The same is the case as
   to witnesses; for whilst it would be unjust to pronounce sentence on
   the testimony of one man, still, if two or three will not suffice,
   there would be no end to litigation. Fitly, then, has God prescribed to
   judges both that they shall not be rashly credulous, and yet that they
   shall be content with the lawful number of witnesses; but this point
   will be more largely treated of elsewhere in commenting both on the
   Sixth and Ninth Commandments.

   7. The hands of the witnesses shall be first. It was not without reason
   that God would have criminals put to death by the hand of those by
   whose testimony they were condemned. The ancient people did not employ
   public executioners, that there might be more solemnity, modesty, and
   reverence in the infliction of punishments. This office he peculiarly
   enjoins upon the witnesses, because the tongue of many is too hasty,
   not to say worse of it, so that they do not hesitate to stab people
   verbally, when they would not dare to lay a finger upon them. This,
   then, was an excellent remedy for the repression of light accusations,
   not to admit the testimony of any, whose hand was not prepared to
   execute the sentence. Stoning was indeed a sad and horrible kind of
   punishment; but it is probable that God made choice of it because it
   required the application of many hands. If hanging had not been in use,
   God would have commanded in vain that the corpse of a man who had been
   hanged should be taken down from the tree before sunset. (Deuteronomy
   21:23.) There were, therefore, other kinds of capital punishment; but
   when the land was to be purged, as by a propitiation, by the death of
   the sinner, he was to be stoned by the hands of the whole people, since
   it would have been cruel for him to be slain by a lingering death,
   which would have been the case if they had stoned him one after
   another. The reason why the people were commanded to cast the stones
   with one consent was, that they might give proof of their zeal, and
   manifest their great indignation that God's worship had been violated.

   11. Non sumes nomen Jehovae Dei tui in vanum: quia non absolvet Jehova
   eum qui nomen suum sumpserit in vanum.


   Exodus 20:7. Thou shalt not take the name. There is a manifest
   synecdoche in this Commandment; for in order that God may procure for
   His name its due reverence, He forbids its being taken in vain,
   especially in oaths. Whence we infer on the other hand an affirmative
   commandment, that every oath should be a testimony of true piety,
   whereby the majesty of God Himself should obtain its proper glory.
   Moreover, it is clear that not only when we swear by God, His name is
   to be reverently honored, but whenever mention of it is made. Thus in
   these words He maintains His holiness not only in His word, but also in
   His works, against all profane contempt of it. We shall soon see that
   to swear by God's name is a species or part of religious worship, and
   this is manifest too from the words of Isaiah 45:23; for when he
   predicts that all nations shall devote themselves to pure religion, he
   thus speaks, "As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
   and every tongue shall swear by me." [308] Now, if the bowing of the
   knees be a token of adoration, this swearing which is connected with it
   is equivalent to an acknowledgment that He is God. Since, then, reason
   dictates that the species is put for the genus, we must see what is to
   be understood by God's name, and by the adverb lsv', leshav. It is
   silly and childish to restrict this to the name Jehovah, [309] as if
   God's majesty were confined to letters or syllables; but, whereas His
   essence is invisible, His name is set before us as an image, in so far
   as God manifests Himself to us, and is distinctly made known to us by
   His own marks, just as men are each by his own name. On this ground
   Christ teaches that God's name is comprehended in the heavens, the
   earth, the temple, the altar, (Matthew 5:34,) because His glory is
   conspicuous in them. Consequently, God's name is profaned whenever any
   detraction is made from His supreme wisdom, infinite power, justice,
   truth, clemency, and rectitude. If a shorter definition be preferred,
   let us say that His name is what Paul calls to gnoston, "that which may
   be known" of Him. (Romans 1:19.)

   God's name, then, is taken in vain, not only when any one abuses it by
   perjury, but when it is lightly and disrespectfully adduced in proof of
   frivolous and trifling matters: I speak with respect to oaths. In this,
   however, man's ingratitude is very gross, that when God grants them His
   name, as if at their entreaty, to put an end to their strifes and to be
   a pledge of their truth, still it flies promiscuously from their mouths
   not without manifest disrespect. God will again condemn perjury in the
   Fifth Commandment of the Second Table, viz., in so far as it offends
   against and violates charity by injuring our neighbors. The aim and
   object of this Commandment is different, i.e., that the honor due to
   God may be unsullied; that we should only speak of Him religiously;
   that becoming veneration of Him should be maintained among us. The word
   lsv', leshau, might indeed be translated "for falsehood," and in this
   sense we shall see it used elsewhere; but since it often is equivalent
   to chnm, chinam, which means gratuitously, or in vain, this exposition
   seems to be most appropriate. In this, too, fuller and richer
   instruction is contained, viz., that men should not drag in His name in
   light matters, as in sport or derision of Him, which cannot be done
   without insulting and profaning it. And thus the holiness of God's
   name, which preserves us in His fear and in true piety, is contrasted
   with the particle lsv', leshau. But since nothing is more difficult
   than to restrain men's licentiousness in this respect, and to excuse or
   at least diminish the sin, the slipperiness of the tongue is pleaded,
   its punishment is here denounced: that if God's name is rashly exposed
   to reproach or contempt, He will avenge it. The more hardened,
   therefore, in their licentiousness they may be, the less will be their
   impunity; so far is depraved habit from diminishing the guilt.

   Leviticus 19:12

   12. And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
   profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

   12. Non jurabitis per nomen meum mendaciter, nec profanabis nomen Dei
   tui: ego Jehova.


   Deuteronomy 6

   Deuteronomy 6:13

   13. ... shalt swear by his name.

   Deuteronomy 10

   Deuteronomy 10:20

   20. ... swear by his name.

                             20. In nomine ejus jurabis.


   Leviticus 19:12. And ye shall not swear by my name falsely. Although
   Moses is treating of the duties of the Second Table, and had previously
   forbidden men to deal fraudulently with their neighbors, he still adds
   this sentence by way of confirmation. It may, however, be inferred from
   the second clause of the verse that He directly had regard to the glory
   of God when he says, "Thou shalt not profane the name of thy God." For
   raging greediness after gain causes the avaricious and rapacious man
   not only to defraud men, but to become insolent to God Himself. Moses,
   therefore, although he is professedly condemning the falsehood and
   deceit whereby our neighbors are injured, at the same time takes
   occasion to introduce the declaration that we must beware lest, whilst
   covetousness impels us to do wrong, injury should be done not only to
   men but to God Himself also. The word used here, however, is not sv',
   shau, as before, but sqr, sheker, which properly signifies
   deceitfulness; and therefore I have said that it enjoins us to beware
   lest any one by his perjury should do any injury to his neighbor;
   nevertheless, that this prohibition has direct reference to the Third
   Commandment, since Moses especially insists on this point, that God's
   name is profaned by perjury, and thus he not only inculcates integrity,
   but also has regard to religion, that God's majesty may not be
   violated. The expression is worthy of notice, "Thou shalt not pollute
   the name of God," because God, who is eternal and immutable truth,
   cannot be more grossly insulted than by being summoned as a witness to
   falsehood, which is assuredly a shameful and wicked pollution. This was
   not regarded by the heathen, who, although they pretended to reverence
   God's name in their oaths, yet made no scruple of deceiving, if he whom
   they had promised deserved it. Thyestes in the poet says, "I never have
   pledged my faith, nor do I pledge it to any faithless person;" [310]
   since his brother was a villain, he considered that he lay under no
   valid obligation to him. This is as if God's majesty were dependent
   upon men's deservings, so that it was allowable to call Him to witness
   whilst we deal deceitfully. Let this, then, be our firm conclusion,
   that in our oaths God is first to be regarded, whose holy name is more
   precious than a hundred worlds.

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:13

   13. ... and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
   be heard out of thy mouth.

   13. Nomen deorum alienorum non memorabitis, non audietur in ore tuo.


   13. Make no mention of the name of other gods. There is no sort of
   doubt but that this declaration should be connected with the Third
   Commandment. Moses explains that God's name is taken in vain and
   abused, if men swear by other gods; for it is not lawful to refer the
   judgment of things unknown to any other than the one true God.
   Consequently, the glory of the Deity is transferred to those by whose
   name men swear. Therefore by the Prophet God pronounces a severe
   denunciation, that He will destroy all those that swear by His name,
   and also by Malcham, (Zephaniah 1:5,) since thus the Jews mixed Him up
   with their idol, and so profaned His holiness. In sum, since by
   swearing we profess that He is our God, whom we declare to be both the
   knower of our hearts and the judge of our souls, the true God justly
   claims this honor for Himself alone, inasmuch as the glory of His name
   is detracted from, not only if we speak less reverently than we should
   of Him, but also if we associate with Him such as may usurp a part of
   His rights. And this more clearly appears from the two passages which
   we have adduced from Deuteronomy, wherein the people are commanded to
   swear by the name of the one God, which is equivalent to rendering to
   His sacred name in our outward profession of service the unmixed
   reverence which it deserves. [311] Still God does not exhort the people
   to indulge themselves freely in oaths, as if by frequent oaths they
   exercised themselves in the duties of piety, but simply means that when
   there is occasion for it or necessity, and a just cause shall demand
   it, they must swear in no other way than by invoking Him alone as their
   witness and judge.

   Deuteronomy 23

   Deuteronomy 23:21-23

   21. When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not
   slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee;
   and it would be sin in thee.

   21. Si votum voveris Jehovae Deo tuo, non tardabis illud solvere:
   alioqui requirendo requiret illud Jehova Deus tuus abs to, et erit in
   to peccatum.

   22. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

   22. Quod si abstinueris a vovendo, non erit in to peccatum:

   23. That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform;
   even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD
   thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

   23. quod egressum fuerit e labiis tuis observabis, et facies sicut
   vovisti Jehovae Deo tuo liberaliter, et sicut loquutus es ore tuo.


   21. When thou shalt vow a vow. The rule of vowing also pertains to the
   keeping of the Third Commandment, since, by vowing, men exercise
   themselves in the sanctification of God's name, and to promise anything
   to God is a kind of swearing. For what between men is called a covenant
   or agreement, with respect to God is a vow; and therefore it may be
   fitly called a sacred engagement, which not only is made with God as
   its witness, but which is contracted with God Himself. We have
   elsewhere cursorily touched upon certain oaths, such as that of the
   Nazarites; but since that consecration was a part of God's worship, I
   have placed it under the First Commandment. Nor indeed did Moses there
   treat directly of the obligation itself of the vow, but of that
   exercise of piety which stimulated the people to the pursuit of purity,
   sanctity, and sobriety. I have followed the same course as to the
   free-will-offerings, which were certainly for the most part votive, but
   I have considered what was the main thing in them without much
   troubling myself as to what was accessory. But now under another head
   Moses confirms what he taught before, that God's name was not to be
   taken in vain; therefore he commands them to pay their vows, by
   withholding which the glory of God's name is diminished, whilst He is
   Himself defrauded of His right, and the promise ratified before Him is
   set at nought. Moreover, it is to be observed that all the vows which
   were ever acceptable to God were testimonies of gratitude, lest the
   recollection of His benefits should fail, forgetfulness of which is too
   apt to steal over us. When, therefore, the saints were conscious of
   tardiness or listlessness in proclaiming His goodness, they made use of
   this aid and spur, as it were, to correct their sloth. Thus, when they
   asked anything of importance from God, they were often accustomed to
   bind themselves by some promise as a manifestation of their
   thankfulness. Such are the vows which Moses commands to be solemnly and
   faithfully paid, that they might not cheat God when they had escaped
   from peril or had obtained what they wished, whereas in their anxiety
   they had been humbly suppliant. For we know with what facility or
   rather levity many are hurried into making vows, who afterwards, with
   the same fickleness, think little of breaking their promise.

   On this point, then, God justly rescues His name from contempt, and to
   this end demands that what has been promised to Him should be paid. But
   inasmuch as superstitious persons apply this, or rather wrest it
   indiscriminately to all vows, their error must be refuted, so that we
   may understand the genuine meaning of Moses. The Papists would have all
   vows kept without exception, because it is written, "Thou shalt not
   slack to pay whatever hath passed your lips." But a definition of vows
   must first be given, or at least we must see what vows are lawful and
   approved by God; for if all vows must be effectually kept, however
   rashly made, of old under the Law it would have been right to kill
   their sons and daughters, to erect altars to idols, and thus under this
   pretext the whole Law of God would have been entirely brought to
   nought. Wherefore a distinction between vows must be laid down, unless
   we wish to confound right and wrong. This then is the first point, that
   nothing can be properly vowed to God, except what we know to be
   pleasing to Him; for if "to obey is better than sacrifice," (1 Samuel
   15:22,) nothing surely can be more absurd than to indulge ourselves in
   the liberty of serving God, each according to his own fancy. If a Jew
   had vowed that he would sacrifice a dog, it would have been sacrilege
   to pay that vow, since it was forbidden by God's Law. But inasmuch as
   there is an intermediate degree between that which God has expressly
   prescribed and forbidden, it might be objected that it was allowable to
   make a vow in respect to things which are called indifferent. My reply
   to this is, that since the principle ought always to be maintained by
   the godly, that nothing is to be done without faith, (Romans 14:23,)it
   must ever be considered whether a thing is agreeable to God's word,
   otherwise our zeal is preposterous. [312]

   God formerly did not forbid many things which He still was not willing
   to have offered to Him in worship; and so now-a-days, although it would
   be lawful not to taste meat all our lifelong, still if any one should
   vow perpetual abstinence with respect to it, he would act
   superstitiously; since he would inconsiderately obtrude upon God what
   we gather from His word that He does not approve. Wherefore if all our
   vows are not reduced to this rule, there will be nothing in them right
   and sure. Another very gross error in the Papists may also be
   condemned, viz., that they foolishly promise God more than they can
   pay. Assuredly it is more than blind arrogance, nay, diabolical
   madness, that a mortal man should wish to present as if it were his,
   what he has not received; as if any one should vow that he would not
   eat during his whole life, or should renounce sleep and the necessary
   supports of life, by common consent he would be convicted of madness.
   No gift, then, can be acceptable to God, except what He in His goodness
   has conferred upon us. But what is done in the Papacy? Monks, and nuns,
   and priests, bind themselves to perpetual celibacy, and do not consider
   that continency is a special gift; and thus whilst none of them has
   regard to the measure of his ability, they wretchedly abandon
   themselves to ruin, or envelop themselves in deadly snares. Besides,
   every one should consider his vocation. A monk will vow himself to his
   abbot, and throw off the paternal yoke: another, who was adapted for
   the transaction of public business, will abandon his children under
   cover of the monastic vow, and thus acquire immunity, Hence it appears,
   that whether a vow should be kept or not, is to be estimated from the
   character of him that vows. But a more gross and more common error is
   committed in respect to the object of vows. I said above that the godly
   never made vows to God, except in testimony of gratitude; whereas
   almost all the vows of the superstitious are so many fictitious acts of
   worship, having no other aim than to propitiate God by the expiation of
   sin, or to acquire favor meritoriously. I will not pursue at length
   those more detestable hallucinations whereby they defile themselves and
   their vows, when they substitute their idols in God's place; as for
   instance, when a man vows [313] an altar to Christopher or Barbara. To
   sanction this barbarous impiety, this passage of Moses is alleged,
   which certainly contains something quite different, viz., that those
   who vow to any other being, pervert the worship of God; and in which
   also Moses takes it for granted that a vow is not accounted legitimate,
   except what is made to God Himself in accordance with the rules of
   religion and the prescription of the Law. Thus in this exordium the
   doctrine is laid down, that guilt is incurred unless what is promised
   is paid.

   22. But if thou shalt forbear to vow. He confirms what he said, that
   they would be guilty before God who have broken their promises to Him,
   because no necessity compelled them to promise, and consequently that
   their guilt was doubled, inasmuch as they chose rather to sin when it
   was at their option not to vow. Thus Peter, reproving the faithlessness
   of Ananias and Sapphira, says, [314]

   "Who hath compelled you to lie to the Holy Ghost? was not the field
   your own, which you might have retained? but now to defraud God of part
   of the price, is impious hypocrisy."
   (Acts 5:4.)

   Meanwhile God indirectly inculcates sobriety in vowing, when He
   discharges them from it as a duty; as if He had reminded them, that
   there was no reason why they should incur guilt by idly promising what
   He does not require. And surely nothing is wiser than to be very
   sparing of vows; since those who run into them inconsiderately, either
   presently repent of them, or else pay them in a servile manner, as if
   it were a task to which they are driven by force, and not without
   annoyance and disgust, and thus destroy the grace of the act. As to the
   words, "that which is gone out of thy lips," they do not refer to the
   ceremony, on which the Jew's as usual too unscrupulously insist; but He
   puts a restraint by them on vowing, to which we are of ourselves but
   too much inclined. Whence it is said in Psalm 66:13, 14,

   "I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay these my
   vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was
   in trouble;"

   although the Prophet intimates that in his sore straits he had always
   retained his composure and presence of mind, so as expressly to implore
   God's help, and to manifest his constancy and confidence by making
   vows, still it is signified at the same time that he did not
   precipitately utter empty words, but spoke with serious reflection. And
   indeed since the tongue of many is too voluble, and goes before their
   heart, the main obligation of vows is not to be sought in the act of
   their utterance; but, to make them truly complete, a mutual agreement
   is required between the heart and tongue. The same expression will
   often occur again; and its repetition shews that it is meant to remove
   the scruples of the weak, lest [315] as soon as any desire to vow shall
   have entered their minds, they should fancy that it imposes a religious
   obligation. We know that among heathen nations, in the solemn
   dedication of their temples, a priest was appointed who should [316]
   first recite the words; by which ceremony they were reminded that
   nothing is duly offered to God except He Himself should dictate it, as
   it were. I allow that this reason was but little considered by them;
   nevertheless, by their example, God would condemn all levity, or
   inconsiderate fervor in sacred offerings.

   Leviticus 27

   Leviticus 27:1-25, 27-29

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man
   shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy
   estimation.

   2. Alloquere filios Israel, et die els, Vir quum separaverit votum
   animarun secundum estimationem tuam Jehovae.

   3. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even
   unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of
   silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

   3. Erit aestimatio tua pro masculo, a filio viginti annorum usque ad
   fillum sexaginta annorum, erit aestimatio tua quinquaginta siclorum
   argenteorum, secundum siclum sanctuarii.

   4. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.

   4. Quod si foemina fuerit, erit aestimatio triginta siclorum.

   5. And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then
   thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female
   ten shekels.

   5. Si autem a filio quinque annorum usque ad filium viginti annorum,
   erit aestimatio tua pro masculo viginti siclorum, pro foemina vero
   decem siclorum.

   6. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
   estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
   female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

   6. Si vero a filio mensis usque ad fillum quinque armorurn, erit
   aestimatio tua pro masculo, quinque siclorum argenteorum, pro foemina
   vero aestimatio tua erit trium siclorurn argenteorum.

   7. And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then
   thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
   shekels.

   7. At si a filio sexaginta annorum, et supra, si pro masculo, erit
   aestimatio tua quindecim siclorum, et pro foemina decem siclorum.

   8. But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
   himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to
   his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

   8. Quod si panperior est quam ut aestimationem tuam possit solvere,
   tune statuct ilium coram sacerdote, et aestimabit eum sacerdos:
   secundum quod apprehenderit marius voventis, aestimabit eum sacerdos.

   9. And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD,
   all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.

   9. Si autem animal voverit de quo offernut oblationem Jehovae, onme de
   quo dederit Jehovae erit sanctitas.

   10. He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
   for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and
   the exchange thereof shall be holy.

   10. Non mutabit illud, neque commntabit illud, melius deteriore, aut
   deterius meliore: quod si commutando commutaverit animal animali, et
   illud et commutatio ejus erit sanctitas.

   11. And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
   sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the
   priest:

   11. Si autem fuerit quodlibet animal immundum, de quo non offerunt
   oblationem Jehovae tunc statuet animal coram sacerdote.

   12. And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou
   valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

   12. Aestimabitque illud sacerdos, sive bonum sit, sive malum, secundum
   aestimationem tuam sic erit.

   13. But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
   thereof unto thy estimation.

   13. Si vero redimendo redemerit illud, addet quintam ejus partem ultra
   aestimationem tuam.

   14. And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD,
   then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the
   priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

   14. Vir autem quum consecraverit domum suam consecrationem Jehovae,
   aestimabit earn sacerdos, sive bona sit, sire roma: secundum quod
   aestimaverit earn sacerdos, sic manebit:

   15. And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall
   add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall
   be his.

   15. Si autem consecrans redemerit domum suam, addet quintam partem
   pecuniae aestimationis tuae super earn, et illius erit.

   16. And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of
   his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed
   thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
   silver.

   16. Si vero de agro possessionis suae consecraverit quis Jehovae, erit
   aestimatio tua secundum sementem ejus, semen cori hordeorum
   quinquaginta siclis argenteis sestimabitur.

   17. If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy
   estimation it shall stand.

   17. Quod siab anno jubilaei consecraverit agrum suum, secundum
   aestimationem tuam manebit.

   18. But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
   shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,
   even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy
   estimation.

   18. Si vero post jubilaeum consecraverit agrum suum, tum supputabit cum
   eo sacerdos pecuniam secundum annos qui reinanent usque ad annum
   jubilaei, et detrahetur de aestimatione tua.

   19. And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
   then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
   it, and it shall be assured to him.

   19. Si autem redimendo redimat agrum qui consecravit ipsum, addet
   quintam partem pecuniae aestimationis tuae super eam, et manebit el.

   20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field
   to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

   20. Si vero non redemerit agrum, et si vendiderit agrum viro alteri,
   non redimet ultra:

   21. But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto
   the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
   priest's.

   21. Sed erit ager quum egredietur jubilaeus, sanctitas Jehovae, sicut
   ager anathematis: sacerdoti erit possessio ejus.

   22. And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought,
   which is not of the fields of his possession;

   22. Si vero agrum emptum a se qui non erat de agro possessionis suae,
   consecraverit Jehovae:

   23. Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation,
   even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in
   that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.

   23. Tunc supputabit illi sacerdos numerum aestimationis tuae usque ad
   annum jubilaei, dabitque aestimationem tuam in die illo sanctitatem
   Jehovae.

   24. In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom
   it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
   belong.

   24. In anno jubilaei revertetur ager ad eum a quo emerat ipsum, ad eum
   eujus erat possessio terrae.

   25. And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
   sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

   25. Omnis autem aestimatio tua erit secundum siclum sanctuarii: viginti
   obolorum est siclus.

   27. And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according
   to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it
   be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.

   27. Si vero fuerit ex animalibus immundis, redimet juxta aestimationem
   tuam, et addet quintam partem ejus ultra eam, et si non redimatur,
   vendatur juxta aestimationem tuam.

   28. Notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the
   LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of
   his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most
   holy unto the LORD.

   28. Veruntamen omne anathema quod consecrabit aliquis Jehovae ex
   onmibus quae habet, de hominibus et animalibus, et de agris
   possessionis suae, non vendetur neque redimetur. Omne enim anathema
   sanetitas sane titatum erit Jehovah.

   29. None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but
   shall surely be put to death.

   29. Omne anathema quod consecrabitur de hominibus non redimetur:
   moriendo morietur.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. In this chapter Moses shews in what
   manner and at what price what once has been offered is to be redeemed,
   supposing that the vows cannot be conveniently paid. Now it is to be
   observed, that among the ancient people there were two modes of
   consecration, the one by anathema, which the Hebrews call chrm, cherem,
   the other for the use of the temple, and other exercises of religion.
   The anathema [317] might be made of unclean animals, and other unholy
   things, as we may see in respect to the city of Jericho, and similar
   instances; but it was not properly allowable to make vows, except of a
   clean man or animal, or something else which might be appropriated in
   the service of God. Thus of their flocks they vowed goats and sheep; of
   their herds, oxen or calves, that they might experience God's goodness
   in their fecundity. If a person was aggrieved at being without
   offspring, in asking it of God he offered in his vow his son, or
   daughter; on which ground Samuel, before he was conceived in the womb,
   was dedicated to God. (1 Samuel 1:22.) If any one had a weakly child
   born to him, or if one of his children was very ill, or if he himself
   was in any difficulty, it was customary to have resort to vows, that
   God might protect what was dedicated to Him. Nor can it be doubted but
   that many abused this and fell into foolish practices; but God
   tolerated these errors as long as they were not opposed to His Law.
   Moreover, since it often happens that those who are under the
   obligation of a vow change their minds, and are not very eager and
   ready to pay it, nay, discharge it with much pain and unwillingness;
   God permitted that what was promised might be redeemed at a certain
   price, in order that their offerings might be voluntary. By the
   imposition of this ransom, which was of the nature of a fine, rashness
   was punished, and future inconsideration prevented, so that they might
   consider well what they were about before they made their vow, and that
   it might not be disagreeable to them to stand by their promises.
   Besides, it is to be remarked, that these vows were confirmed, not
   because they were altogether pleasing to God, but lest the people
   should accustom themselves to impious contempt of Him, if the deceiver
   might with impunity refuse God what he had promised, Moses first treats
   of persons; and estimates a male at fifty shekels of the sanctuary from
   twenty-five years of age to sixty; since this is the best time of life
   in which a man's work is profitable. A woman he estimates at thirty
   shekels; since for the most part less profit is made by a woman than a
   man; and although it might occur that some women would be much more
   valuable than men, since sometimes women are found to be industrious,
   prudent, discreet, and strong to labor, whilst men are idle, dull,
   lazy, and weak, still a general law must needs be given, for the
   examination would have been too difficult if each individual was to be
   estimated according to their good qualities. God then does not pay
   exact attention to the merits of each, but is contented with the common
   calculation. He then lays down rules as to an earlier age, viz., from
   five to twenty, and rates the male at twenty shekels, the female at
   ten. He afterwards descends to infants, and appoints the price of a
   male from one month to five years, at five shekels, and a female at
   three. Fourthly, he estimates those who are more than sixty, the male
   at fifteen shekels, the female at ten; since old age debilitates the
   vigor both of mind and body, and gradually destroys it. In the fifth
   place, an exception is made lest the poor should be burdened beyond
   their slender means, that the priest should diminish the price as much
   as he saw fit. Still this diminution had reference also to the rich, if
   the person to be redeemed was not worth the ordinary price, though it
   appears that God here especially makes a provision for the poor from
   the words, "according [318] to what the hand of him that vowed shall
   attain;" by which clause Moses [319] is wont to express poverty, or
   want, because the poor and needy are not supplied with sufficient for
   their desires.

   11. And if it be any unclean beast. Moses now, in the second place,
   treats of brute animals; which God commands to be sacrificed to Him, if
   they are suitable for it, and does not suffer the vow to be altered.
   But if they be imperfect or unclean, He lays down the rule for their
   redemption. But the question here arises, How it can be allowable to
   vow what God had forbidden to be offered to Him, and so had prohibited
   from being brought into the temple, as being unclean? Surely if it had
   entered into any one's mind to sacrifice an unclean animal, the
   superstition would be rejected, nay, there would be need of expiation.
   But here, in my opinion, another kind of offering is adverted to, which
   did not vitiate the sacrifices and service of God by being contrary to
   the injunctions of His Law. There was therefore nothing strange in His
   accepting such a vow, though He punishes its levity by a pecuniary
   fine. Besides, suppose a strong and well-tried horse was in danger, his
   master made a vow that if it were saved he would be bound to pay its
   price; and so also in the other cases. To vow was nothing else than to
   commit to God's faithfulness and protection whatever they wished to be
   preserved. Hence the too great commonness of vows, which still it was
   necessary to discharge in some way, lest God's sacred name should be
   exposed to ridicule. This estimation God left to the arbitration of the
   priest. But if an animal might be offered in sacrifice, no redemption
   was allowed; and if any one had substituted another animal, or paid the
   price of it, he was punished for his fraud, for both (i.e., the animal,
   and its substitute or price) were consecrated to God. The estimation,
   which is imposed upon one who had vowed, is irreversible, since God
   simply commands the Israelites to stand by the judgment of the priest,
   and to abide by the taxation, as it is called, enjoined upon them as a
   fixed rule; and, besides, they were to add a fifth part, as an
   additional fine, to the price appointed by the priest.

   14. And when a man shall sanctify his house. A third kind of vows
   follows, viz., the consecration of houses and lands; under which head
   also an alternative is appointed, so that religion may not be despised,
   and still the just possessors should not be driven from their houses,
   or the lands be rendered useless from the want of cultivation. Those
   persons vowed their houses, who sought of God for themselves and
   families that they might inhabit them in health, and safety, and in
   general prosperity; and he who wished to obtain fertility for his
   fields, vowed one of ten or twenty acres. Undoubtedly superstitious
   prayers were sometimes mixed up with this exercise of piety, as if they
   might acquire favor for themselves by making a bargain with God. Still,
   inasmuch as the thing was not wrong in itself, God indulgently bore
   with the errors which could not be very easily corrected, lest, in His
   hatred of them, He might altogether abolish what was useful and
   laudable. Hence the redemption both of house and land was permitted.
   But if any one had committed fraud in selling a piece of land that was
   vowed, a heavier punishment is added, i.e., that he should go without
   it for ever. We shall speak more fully elsewhere of the year of
   jubilee. [320] At present this must be observed, that, lest the
   partition of land made by Joshua should ever be altered, since God had
   clearly shewn that it was done by His authority, God recalled each of
   the tribes every fiftieth year to their original share, and thus
   entirely restored the possessors whom poverty had driven out. In
   proportion, then, to the closeness or remoteness of that year, since
   possession would be so much the shorter or longer, land was cheap or
   dear. God does not here measure the fields by the pole or chain, but
   estimates them simply, as among a rude people, by the seed; viz., if a
   field in sowing takes a homer [321] of barley, it shall remain in the
   hands of its possessor if he pays fifty shekels of the sanctuary. We
   have elsewhere seen that these were double the ordinary shekel. But
   since vows were often made in the middle or towards the end of the
   jubilee, a distinction is stated; and God commands the priests to take
   the time into consideration, and the nearer the jubilee-year may be to
   diminish so much of the price. Where, however, a fraud had taken place,
   God would not have the honest purchaser ejected; but, when the jubilee
   was over, He assigned the field, which had been held for a time in
   sacrilege, to the priests for ever. Moses compares this consecration to
   an anathema, which the Hebrews call chrm, cherem, [322] a word whose
   radical meaning is destroying or abolishing; for which reason the
   Latins take a "devoted" thing in a bad sense, as what is destined to
   final destruction. The law is then extended to lands which had been
   sold, and which, in the year of jubilee, returned to their former
   owners; because the first allotment of the land was then wholly
   restored. For these fields God commands a price to be paid, upon a
   calculation of the time, so that only the produce and not the fee
   should be taken into account.

   Now, since people have improperly and in foolish mimicry imitated the
   vows which God permitted to the Jews under the Law, so the Pope, in
   providing for their redemption, has dared in his diabolical arrogance
   to rival God. The titulus [323] is well-known in the Third Book of
   Decretals; "De voto, et ejus redemptione;" wherein its concocter,
   whoever he was, has so sought to impose upon the world with his
   shameless nonsense, as not to hesitate to heap together directly
   contradictory sentences; and even if there were no contradictions
   there, still nothing is laid down except how votive pilgrimages are to
   be redeemed, which plainly appear from Christ's declaration to be wrong
   since the preaching of the gospel. (John 4:21.) And assuredly it was a
   marvellous fascination of the devil, that what was said under the Law
   as to the payment of vows at Jerusalem, should be transferred to
   Christians, when Christ had pronounced that the time had come when the
   true worshippers without distinction of place should worship God
   everywhere in spirit and in truth. If the hired wranglers [324] of the
   Pope object that the same rule obtains in the redemption of vows, since
   a remedy or mitigation must not be denied, if any should be too
   burdensome or grievous, I answer, that men act wickedly, when they
   wrest to themselves what God has reserved for His own discretion; for
   neither under the Law of old was it allowable for a mortal man to alter
   a vow, unless by His permission. If again they object, that the
   judgment was given to the priests, here their folly is twice refuted;
   since they cannot shew that they have been appointed judges; nor can
   they escape from the accusation of temerity, since without any command
   they pronounce as to this redemption of vows, whereas the priests of
   old advanced nothing except from God's mouth, and according to the
   fixed rule here laid down.

   The exception as to the firstlings and the tithes sufficiently proves
   that some vows were illicit, and such as God repudiates; and therefore
   that they must not be made indiscriminately, for it would have been a
   mere work of supererogation to vow to God what He had already made His
   own; as we have shewn elsewhere, [325] where I have inserted this
   passage. With respect to what is said of the anathema, it must not be
   understood generally, since it was not lawful to subject a man to it,
   unless he were worthy of death. This, then, must be restricted to their
   enemies, whom they were otherwise at liberty to destroy; a notorious
   example of which was the city of Jericho, with its inhabitants and
   spoils. Now, since whatever was brought under this anathema was devoted
   and accursed, God would have it destroyed, nor does He allow of any
   compensation. Wherefore they anathematized their fields I do not
   understand, unless perhaps they wished to expiate some crime whereby
   pollution was contracted.

   34, is headed "Concerning a vow and its redemption;" and all the eleven
   chapters of this Titulus relate to the commutation of vows to go on
   pilgrimage, or on a crusade. The portion especially alluded to by C. in
   the above remarks was obviously ch. 7, which consists of extracts from
   an answer of Pope Innocent III. to a Suffragan of the Archbishop of
   Sens, who had taken a crusader's vow for the purpose of obtaining
   access to the Count of Champagne, then in Palestine, and wanted to know
   whether the Pope would sanction his staying at home, since he had heard
   that the Count was dead. The Pope replies, that as the cause which had
   induced him to make his vow no longer existed, he might stay in his
   diocese; but that he should send to the holy land a sum equal to what
   would have been the cost of his going, staying, and returning. The

   Numbers 30

   Numbers 30:1-16

   1. And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children
   of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.

   1. Et loquutus est Moses ad capita tribuum in Israel, dicendo: Hic est
   sermo quem praecepit Jehova.

   2. If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul
   with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all
   that proceedeth out of his mouth.

   2. Vir qui voverit votum Jehovae, aut juravefit jusjurandum, quo
   constringendo constrinxerit animam suam, ne violet verbum suum: sed
   secundum omne quod egressum fuerit ex ore ejus, faciat.

   3. If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond,
   being in her father's house in her youth;

   3. Mulier autem si vovetit votum Jehovae, et constringendo
   constrinxerit in domo patris sui in pueritia sua:

   4. And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound
   her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows
   shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall
   stand.

   4. Et audierit pater ejus votum ipsius, et oblationem qua adstrinxit
   animam suam, et tacuerit ei (vel ad eam) pater ejus, stabilia erunt
   omnia vota ejus, omnisque obligatio qua constrinxit animam suam
   stabilietur.

   5. But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any
   of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall
   stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed
   her.

   5. Si autem irritum fetetit pater ejus illo die quo audierit omne votum
   ab ea factum, et obligationem ejus quibus constrinxerit animam suam,
   non stabilietur: et Jehova parcet el, quia pater ejus irritum fecerit.

   6. And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought
   out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

   6. Quod si fuerit sub viro, et fuerint vota ejus super eam, aut
   prolatio labiorum qua constrinxerit animam suam:

   7. And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that
   he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she
   bound her soul shall stand.

   7. Et audierit maritus eius, et die quo audivit tacuerit el: tunc
   stabilietur vota ejus, et obligationes quibus constrinxerit animam suam
   stabilientur.

   8. But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then
   he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with
   her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD
   shall forgive her.

   8. Quod si quo die audivit marl tus ejus irritum id fecerit, et
   dissolverit vota ejus quae erant super eam, et prolationem labiorum
   ejus relaxaverit, qua constrinxerat animam suam, tunc Jehova propitius
   illi erit.

   9. But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith
   they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

   9. Votum autem omne viduae et repudiatae quo constrinxerit animam suam,
   stabilietur super eam.

   10. And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a
   bond with an oath;

   10. Porro si in domo mariti sui votum fecerit, aut constringendo
   constrinxerit animam per jusjurandum:

   11 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed
   her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
   bound her soul shall stand.

   11. Et maritus ejus audierit et tacuerit ei, nec irritum fecerit illud:
   tune stabilientur omnia ejus vota, et omnis obligatio qua eonstrinxerit
   animam suam stabilietur.

   12. But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard
   them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
   concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made
   them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.

   12. Quod si dissolvendo dissolverit illa maritus ejus, quo die audivit
   omnem prolationem labiorum ejus, ad vota ejus, et obligationem animae
   ejus, non stabilietur; maritus ejus dissolvit ea, et Jehova propitius
   erit el.

   13. Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband
   may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

   13. Omne votum, et omnejusjurandum obligationis ad affligendam animam
   maritus ejus stabiliet, et maritus ejus dissolvet.

   14. But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to
   day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are
   upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the
   day that he heard them.

   14. Sin tacendo tacuerit maritus ejus a die in diem, tune stabiliet
   omnia vota ejus, et omnes obligationes ejus: quae sunt super eam,
   stabiliet, quia tacuit ei quo die audivit.

   15. But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
   them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

   15. Quod si dissolvendo dissolverit, ea postquam audierit, portabit
   iniquitatem illius.

   16. These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a
   man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her
   youth in her father's house.

   16. Haec sunt statuta quae praecepit Jehova Most inter virum et uxorem
   ejus, inter patrem et filiam ejus quae est in pueritia in domo patris
   sui.


   1 And Moses spake. Moses teaches in this chapter that the vows which
   were made by persons who were not free, were not held good before God;
   and although no mention is made of male children, still, as their
   condition was the same, it seems that by synecdoche they must be
   included with the daughters and wives, unless perhaps God chose to pay
   regard to the weaker sex. But since He permits females, who were not
   under their father's power, to make vows in spite of their sex, nor
   does He make it to be an excuse for levity or thoughtlessness, it seems
   that the object proposed was, that the right of the father over his
   children as well as of the husband over the wife, should be maintained
   inviolate.

   2. If a man vow a vow. Wishing to modify the general law, lest any one
   should think that there was any contradiction in this exception, he
   begins by repeating the law itself, that every one should faithfully
   pay whatever he had vowed; as much as to say, that this stands good,
   but that he only refers to such as are their own masters; and that
   women or girls who are under the power of another, were not free to
   make vows without the concurrence of their fathers' or husbands'
   consent. This preface, however, must be understood, as I have already
   pointed out, of lawful vows, whereby neither is religion corrupted nor
   the holiness of God's name profaned. And assuredly, unless what we
   offer is acceptable to God, there can be no obligation on the
   conscience. Moreover, since there is here a distinction made between
   males and females, it may be probably conjectured that boys of ten
   years old, although still united with their family, are bound by their
   promises; and therefore I will not pertinaciously contend about this,
   because it is better to leave undecided whatever is doubtful, and
   disputable, as it is commonly called, on either side.

   3. If a woman also vow. He now proceeds to the point of which he
   proposed to treat, i.e., that vows made by persons who are not their
   own masters do not hold good; and he mentions two cases. For, in the
   first place, he teaches that if a daughter, whilst living with her
   father, has vowed anything without his knowledge, it is of no force. He
   lays down the same rule, if the father, hearing the vow, has disallowed
   it; but if he has held his peace, it is declared that his silence is
   equivalent to consent. Hence we gather that all those who are possessed
   of power do not do their duty unless they frankly and discreetly
   express their opposition whenever anything displeases them; since their
   connivance is a kind of tacit approbation. In the second place, he
   treats of married women, whose vows, made in the absence or with the
   disapproval of their husbands, he commands to be of none effect; but if
   the husbands have known of them, and been silent, he obliges their
   performance. For many deceptions might have thus arisen; since it is
   usual with many when they wish to gratify their wives, to conceal their
   opinion for the time, but, when the period of actual performance
   arrives, to elude what may have been promised. But unless they use
   their privilege in proper time, God would have them bear the punishment
   of their servile indulgence and dissimulation; but because women are
   often urged to deceive by their levity and inconstancy, this danger is
   also anticipated. It may also happen [326] that a woman, when subject
   to her husband, may make a vow in the precipitate fervor of her zeal,
   and when he is dead, may retract it under the specious pretext that she
   was not then free and her own mistress; the same thing may occur when a
   divorced woman shall bind herself, and then when she has married, shall
   appear to herself to be released. Since instances of this wicked change
   of mind are too frequent, no wonder that this special precaution should
   be added, to prevent frauds. Wherefore God declares that the period
   when the vow was made is to be considered, so that they are no less
   liable than as if their condition had remained the same. He therefore
   condemns to the performance of their vow those women who have been
   emancipated from their fathers' authority by marriage, and also who
   have been set free by death or divorce; yet it appears from the last
   verse of the chapter, that two exceptions, modifying the general law,
   are here peculiarly treated of.

   5. But if her father disallow her. The expression is remarkable, "And
   the Lord shall forgive her," whereby Moses gently reproves the foolish
   thoughtlessness of the girl; and soon afterwards the same thing is
   spoken of married women. And surely their rashness is worthy of
   reprehension, if unmindful of their condition, they, as it were, shake
   off the yoke and hastily commit themselves. God therefore hints that
   they are not without blame; but lest they should be tormented by secret
   remorse, He removes every scruple, declaring that He will forgive, if
   the performance of the vow shall have been prevented in any other
   quarter. When the dissent of the father or the husband is required on
   the same day, it is tantamount to saying that what they have once
   approved of cannot be disallowed. Further, to "hold his peace" to a
   wife or daughter, signifies that he does not oppose, but give by
   silence a token of consent.

   9. But every vow of a widow. I have stated why widows are expressly
   named, viz., lest a woman should think that by a second marriage she
   would escape, as being no longer free, and again under the yoke; since
   by such subtle excuses people often extricate themselves. No other
   subject is referred to down to the end of the last verse but one; for
   they have made a very gross mistake, who interpret it as applying to a
   family and its master. [327] The subject itself certainly does not
   admit of such an explanation; and the words of Moses forbid it: so that
   it is the more surprising that persons skilled in the Hebrew language
   have not seen the matter clearly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [326] The Lat. is, "Accidet ut mulier in vidaitate viro non subjecta,
   praecipiti zeli fervore voveat, eo mortuo retractet specioso praetextu,
   quia tunc libera non erat, nec sui juris." The Fr., "Il adviendra
   qu'une femme estante en sujection de mari, vouera par une ardeur
   hastive de zele, le marl trespasse, elle prendra honneste couverture de
   se retracter, d'autant qu'elle n'estoit pas libre pour lors." I have
   translated the latter, not being able to understand the original, nor
   to reconcile them.

   [327] Ver. 10, v'm-vyt 'ysh. Literally, "And if the house of her
   husband." C. and A.V. follow LXX. in assuming that the preposition in
   should be supplied before the house. S.M., on the other hand,
   translates the word vyt, family, which is undeniably allowable; but
   says in a note, "By family, is to be understood the wife here, as the
   chief personage in it after its master." To this treatment of the text
   C. here adverts, as strange on the part of one so skillful in the
   Hebrew tongue. -- W

   Leviticus 24

   Leviticus 24:15, 16

   15. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
   curseth his God shall bear his sin.

   15. Ad filios Israel loqueris, dicendo: Homo qui maledixerit Dec sue,
   portabit scelus suum.

   16. And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be
   put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as
   well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth
   the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.

   16. Et qui transfixerit nomen Jehovae, morte moriatur: lapidando
   lapidabit eum universus coetus, sive indigena fuerit, sive peregrinus,
   quum transfixerit nomen, moriatur.


   15. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. Hence it now more
   clearly appears that the object of the Third Commandment was that God's
   holy name should be honored with the respect and veneration which it
   deserves, since the insult whereby it is violated is condemned to
   capital punishment. By the expression "cursing," Moses designates all
   profane and impure words which tend to brand it with dishonor; as if
   any one should accuse God either of injustice or cruelty; or should
   assail Him with blasphemies; or designedly detract from His glory
   either in anger or wantonness, since many, when exasperated, launch
   forth horrible blasphemies, whilst others make a parade of their
   audacity by scoffing at Him. The second verb, which is twice repeated
   in the next verse, nqv, nakab, [328] means in Hebrew to hollow out or
   perforate, and metaphorically to unfold, thus the Latins say that what
   is thoroughly brought out is "enucleated." The source of the metaphor
   as applied to contumely is not very dissimilar. The translation "he who
   shall have expressed," which some give, is lame; to me the word
   "transfix" seems to be very suitable in the present passage, nor are
   the Latin phrases proscindere or lacerate very different. As to the
   meaning there is tolerable agreement, i.e., that God would not have His
   holy name disrespectfully traduced; and assuredly it is insupportably
   impious when the tongue of mortal man, which was created to celebrate
   the praises of God, is employed in insulting Him. The kind of death is
   also appointed, when He commands the offender to be stoned by the whole
   people, so that all may learn from the sight that such a monster should
   be annihilated as contaminating the earth. God also would prove the
   zeal of His people, by calling them all forth in defense of His glory,
   and arming them for vengeance. Moreover, He did not subject to this
   punishment the Jews only, who professed to be His worshippers, but also
   strangers who were dwelling in the land in the exercise of their
   business; viz., that they might more severely punish the crime in His
   own servants who were less excusable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   nqv in this passage, for which he is not indebted to S.M.; and modern
   lexicographers have given their sanction to C.'s view. -- W

   9. Sex diebus operaberis et facies universum opus tuum.

   10. But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
   shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
   manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
   is within thy gates:

   10. Dies autem septimus Sabbathum Jehovae Dei tui est. Non facies ullum

   inquilinus tuus qui est in portis tuis:

   11. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
   that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed
   the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

   11. Quoniam sex diebus fecit Jehova coelum et terram, mare et

   13. Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

   13. Sex diebus operaberis, et facies universum opus tuum: dies autem

   14. But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
   shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
   manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any
   of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy

   15. And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
   that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and
   by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to
   keep the sabbath day.

   Jehova Deus tuus inde per manum fortem et brachium extentum. Idcirco
   praecepit Jehova Deus tuus ut facias diem sabbathi.


   Exodus 20:8. Remember the Sabbath-day. The object of this Commandment
   is that believers should exercise themselves in the worship of God; for
   we know how prone men are to fall into indifference, unless they have
   some props to lean on or some stimulants to arouse them in maintaining
   their care and zeal for religion. Under the Second Commandment we have
   already indeed made some remarks on the outward profession of piety,
   and under the First also brief mention has been made of some festivals,
   inasmuch as in the passover and the offering of the first-fruits the
   people devoted themselves to God, as if by a solemn repetition of the
   covenant. Many also of the ceremonies which we have explained had an
   affinity to the Sabbath. Yet it is not without good cause that God has
   appointed a special place to the Sabbath as well as to the other
   festivals; and although there is a connection between the observance of
   the Sabbath and the tabernacle with its sacrifices, and the priesthood
   itself, still it was advisedly done that the festivals should be
   separately appointed, that by their aid the people might be the more
   encouraged to maintain the unity of the faith and to preserve the
   harmony of the Church. Meanwhile, the mutual connection between the
   sanctuary and the Sabbath is evident from what has been already said.
   God indeed would have it to be a notable symbol of distinction between
   the Jews and heathen nations. Whence, too, the devil, in order to
   asperse pure and holy religion with infamy, has often traduced the
   Jewish Sabbath through froward tongues. But the better to shew what
   there is peculiar in this Commandment, and what is its difference from
   the First, we must remember the spiritual substance of the type; for
   not only did God prescribe certain days for the holding of assemblies,
   in which the people might give attention to sacrifices, prayers, and
   the celebration of His praise; but He placed before their eyes as the
   perfection of sanctity that they should all cease from their works.
   Surely God has no delight in idleness and sloth, and therefore there
   was no importance in the simple cessation of the labors of their hands
   and feet; nay, it would have been a childish superstition to rest with
   no other view than to occupy their repose in the service of God. [329]
   Wherefore, lest we should make any mistake in the meaning of this
   Commandment, it is well to remember its analogy and conformity with the
   thing it signifies; i.e., that the Jews might know that their lives
   could not be approved by God unless, by ceasing from their own works,
   they should divest themselves of their reason, counsels, and all the
   feelings and affections of the flesh. For they were not forbidden
   without exception from the performance of every work, since they were
   required both to circumcise their children, and to bring the victims
   into the court, and to offer them in sacrifice on that day; but they
   were only called away from their own works, that, as if dead to
   themselves and to the world, they might wholly devote themselves to
   God. Wherefore, since God declares elsewhere by Moses, and again by
   Ezekiel, that the Sabbath is a sign between Him and the Jews that He
   sanctifies them, (Ezekiel 31:13; Ezekiel 20:12,) we must see what is
   the sum of this sanctification, viz., the death of the flesh, when men
   deny themselves and renounce their earthly nature, so that they may be
   ruled and guided by the Spirit of God.

   Although this is sufficiently plain, still it will be worth while to
   confirm it by further statements. And first of all, that this was a
   ceremonial precept, Paul clearly teaches, calling it a shadow of these
   things, the body of which is only Christ. (Colossians 2:17.) But if the
   outward rest was nothing but a ceremony, the substance of which must be
   sought in Christ, it now remains to be considered how Christ actually
   exhibited what was then prefigured; and this the same Apostle declares,
   when he states that "our old man is crucified with Christ," and that we
   are buried with Him, that His resurrection may be to us newness of
   life. (Romans 6:4.) It is to be gathered without doubt from many
   passages, that the keeping of the Sabbath was a serious matter, since
   God inculcates no other commandment more frequently, nor more strictly
   requires obedience to any; and again, when He complains that He is
   despised, and that the Jews have fallen into extreme ungodliness, He
   simply says that His "Sabbaths are polluted," as if religion
   principally consisted in their observance. (Jeremiah 17:24; Ezekiel
   20:21; 22:8; 23:38.) Moreover, if there had not been some peculiar
   excellency in the Sabbath, [330] it might have appeared to be an act of
   atrocious injustice to command a man to be put to death for cutting
   wood upon it. (Numbers 15:32.) Wherefore it must be concluded that the
   substance of the Sabbath, which Paul declares to be in Christ, must
   have been no ordinary good thing. Nor does its excellency require much
   eulogium, since spiritual rest is nothing else than the truly desirable
   and blessed death of man, which contains in it the life of God, even as
   Paul glories that he is as it were dead, because Christ liveth in him.
   (Galatians 2:20.) The Apostle in the epistle to the Hebrews argues more
   subtilely, that true rest is brought to us by the Gospel, and that it
   is rejected by unbelievers, (Hebrews 4:3;) for although he mixes up
   some allegorical matter with it, he still retains the genuine reason of
   the Commandment, viz., that we should rest from our works "even as God
   from His." (Hebrews 4:10.) On this ground Isaiah, when he reproves the
   hypocrites for insisting only on the external ceremony of rest, accuses
   them of "finding their own pleasure" on the Sabbath, (Isaiah 58:13;) as
   much as to say, that the legitimate use of the Sabbath must be supposed
   to be self-renunciation, since he is in fact accounted to cease from
   his works who is not led by his own will nor indulges his own wishes,
   but who suffers himself to be directed by the Spirit of God. And this
   emptying out of self must proceed so far that the Sabbath is violated
   even by good works, so long as we regard them as our own; for rightly
   does Augustin remark in the last chapter of the 22d book, De Civitate
   Dei, [331] -- "For even our good works themselves, since they are
   understood to be rather His than ours, are thus imputed to us for the
   attaining of that Sabbath, when we are still and see that He is God;
   [332] for, if we attribute them to ourselves, they will be servile,
   whereas we are told as to the Sabbath, Thou shalt not do any servile
   work in it."

   Next it is asked, why God rather assigned every seventh day to the
   Sabbath rather than the sixth or tenth. Because the number seven often
   represents perfection in Scripture, some have thought that believers
   were thus reminded that they must strive after perfect holiness with
   all their might, and not devote themselves to God by halves only.
   Others elicit a different meaning from it, although not a contrary one,
   that believers were taught that although they might be sanctified and
   laboring in all sincerity to cease from their own life, still some
   remainders of the flesh would continue in them, and therefore that
   through the whole course of their life they must aspire to that
   holiness which no mortal attains. I do not, however, doubt but that God
   created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, that He might
   give a manifestation of the perfect excellency of His works, and thus,
   proposing Himself as the model for our imitation, He signifies that He
   calls His own people to the true goal of felicity. Although a promise
   is included in this Commandment, yet will we observe upon it
   separately, and as if by the way. He promises indeed that as He blessed
   the seventh day and set it apart, so He will bless believers to
   sanctify them. But the main point is the command, and the recital of
   the blessing is equivalent to an exhortation to obedience, since
   otherwise it would be inappropriately placed here amongst the
   Commandments of the Law. When I said that the ordinance of rest was a
   type of a spiritual and far higher mystery, and hence that this
   Commandment must be accounted ceremonial, I must not be supposed to
   mean that it had no other different objects also. And certainly God
   took the seventh day for His own and hallowed it, when the creation of
   the world was finished, that He might keep His servants altogether free
   from every care, for the consideration of the beauty, excellence, and
   fitness of His works. There is indeed no moment which should be allowed
   to pass in which we are not attentive to the consideration of the
   wisdom, power, goodness, and justice of God in His admirable creation
   and government of the world; but, since our minds are fickle, and apt
   therefore to be forgetful or distracted, God, in His indulgence
   providing against our infirmities, separates one day from the rest, and
   commands that it should be free from all earthly business and cares, so
   that nothing may stand in the way of that holy occupation. On this
   ground He did not merely wish that people should rest at home, but that
   they should meet in the sanctuary, there to engage themselves in prayer
   and sacrifices, and to make progress in religious knowledge through the
   interpretation of the Law. In this respect we have an equal necessity
   for the Sabbath with the ancient people, so that on one day we may be
   free, and thus the better prepared to learn and to testify our faith. A
   third object of the Sabbath is also stated by Moses, but an accidental
   one as it were, viz., that it may be a day of relaxation for servants.
   Since this pertains to the rule of charity, it has not properly any
   place in the First Table, and is therefore added by Moses as an
   extrinsic advantage, as will be seen a little further on.

   8. Remember the Sabbath-day. The word keep is used in Deuteronomy with
   the same meaning. Hence we infer that it is no trifling matter here in
   question, since God enforces the sanctity of the Sabbath by these two
   words, and exhorts the Jews to its scrupulous observance, thus
   condemning carelessness about it as a transgression. Moreover, when He
   says, "Six days shalt thou labor," He indirectly reproves their
   ingratitude, if it should be irksome and disagreeable to them, to
   devote one day out of the seven to God, when He in His generosity gives
   up six to themselves. For he does not, as some have foolishly thought,
   make a demand here for six days' labor; but by His very kindness
   entices them to obedience, since He only claims a seventh part (of
   their time) for Himself -- as if He had said, Since you cannot be
   instant in seeking me with all your affection and attention, at any
   rate give up to me some little undistracted time. Therefore, He says,
   "all thy work," whereby He signifies that they have plenty of time,
   exclusive of the Sabbath, for all their business.

   10. Thou shalt not do any work. That is, whatever could have been
   finished yesterday, or postponed till to-morrow. (For instance, [333] )
   it was not lawful for judges to give a hearing to two litigants; but if
   any one had violently assaulted his neighbor, it was allowable to
   prevent the injury, and to give relief to the unoffending person;
   because the necessity of the case admitted of no delay. It was not
   lawful to cook food for your guests; but if an ox or an ass had fallen
   into a pit it was to be taken out, because aid would have been too late
   on the morrow. For this reason Christ. declares that "the Sabbath was
   made for man, and not man for the Sabbath," (Mark 2:27,) since God does
   not require more than was useful or necessary for keeping the people in
   the exercise of piety. Thus it would have been wicked to send out an ox
   to pasture; but if an ox that tossed had got out, it was right to bring
   it back to its stall, lest it should kill or injure those whom it met.

   Thy man-servant and thy maid-servant. Although it is added in
   Deuteronomy that God had respect to equity, when He commands a
   relaxation from labor to be given to the men and maid-servants, and the
   Israelites are called upon to remember that they were once servants,
   that they may be more disposed to act humanely, still we must bear in
   mind what I have stated, that the direct object here was the honoring
   of the One God. We know that the whole race of Abraham were consecrated
   to God, and that their servants were a kind of adjunct to them, so that
   they were circumcised in common with themselves. And assuredly it is
   very absurd that a man should encourage a profane contempt of God in
   the family over which he presides, and in which he would be recognised
   as master. The case of "strangers" was different, who were obliged to
   rest on the Sabbath, although they remained uncircumcised; for he does
   not only refer to the foreigners, who had subscribed to the Law, but
   also to the uncircumcised. If any should object that they were
   improperly made partakers of the sacred sign whereby God had bound His
   elect people to Himself, the reply is easy, that this was not done for
   their sakes, but lest anything opposed to the Sabbath should happen
   beneath the eyes of the Israelites; as we may understand more clearly
   from the case of the oxen and asses. Surely God would never have
   required spiritual service of brute animals; yet He ordained their
   repose as a lesson, so that wherever the Israelites turned their eyes,
   they might be incited to the observation of the Sabbath. Nor can we
   wonder at this, when in the general mournings which were appointed for
   the deprecation of God's wrath, a fast was imposed upon the brutes,
   that wretched men being admonished by the sight, might feel the burden
   of their guilt the more, and by their voluntary serf-accusation might
   prevent the judgment of God, and might be seriously dissatisfied with
   themselves on account of those sins, whose punishment they saw to be
   imposed to a certain degree upon innocent animals. Besides, if the very
   least liberty had been conceded to them, they would have done many
   things to evade the Law in their days of rest, by employing strangers
   and the cattle in their work.

   11. For in six days the Lord made. From this passage it may be probably
   conjectured that the hallowing of the Sabbath was prior to the Law; and
   undoubtedly what Moses has before narrated, that they were forbidden to
   gather the manna on the seventh day, seems to have had its origin from
   a well-known and received custom; whilst it is not credible that the
   Observance of the Sabbath was omitted, when God revealed the rite of
   sacrifice to the holy (Fathers. [334] ) But what in the depravity of
   human nature was altogether extinct among heathen nations, and almost
   obsolete with the race of Abraham, God renewed in His Law: that the
   Sabbath should be honored by holy and inviolable observance; and this
   the impure dogs [335] accounted to be amongst the disgraces of the
   Jewish nation.

   Exodus 35

   Exodus 35:1-3

   1. And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
   together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath
   commanded, that ye should do them.

   1. Congregavit Moses universum coetum filiorum Israel, et dixit illis,
   Haec sunt verba quae princepit Jehova ut faciatis.

   2. Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be
   to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work
   therein shall be put to death.

   2. Sex diebus facies opus, die septimo erit vobis sanctitas, Sabbathum
   cessationis Jehovae: quisquis fecerit opus in eo, morietur.

   3. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath
   day.

   3. Ne accendatis ignem in omnibus habitaculis vestris die Sabbathi.


   Leviticus 19

   Leviticus 19:3

   3. ... keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

   3. Sabbatha mea servate: ego Jehova Deus vester.


   Leviticus 19:30; 26:2. Ye shall keep my Sabbaths. From these two
   passages it is manifest that the service of the tabernacle was annexed
   to the Sabbath, and that the two things were not only connected by an
   indissoluble tie, but that the rest from labor had reference to the
   sacrifices; since it would have been a mere mockery to rest without any
   ulterior object; nay more, after Moses has spoken of the rest, he seems
   to subjoin the reverencing of the sanctuary, as if it were the generic
   ordinance; so that the people might understand that all impediments
   were removed which are wont to withdraw them from the service of God.
   The expression, "fear the sanctuary," [336] is a figurative one; but is
   equivalent to this, that they should shew by their very reverence of
   the sanctuary how truly and sincerely they fear God, who had promised
   that He would be present there, whenever He should be invoked.

   [336] "Reverence my sanctuary." -- A.V. Ainsworth says, "In Targum
   Jonathan this law is explained thus, Ye shall go to the house of my

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:12

   12. Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt
   rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy
   handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

   12. Sex diebus facies opera tua: die autem septimo quiesces, ut
   quiescat bos tuus, et asinus tuus, et respiret filius ancillae tuae, et
   peregrinus.


   12. Six days thou shalt do thy work. In this passage the incidental use
   of the Sabbath is again referred to, although it is no inherent part of
   its original institution, viz., that by its means the family also and
   the cattle shall be benefited. There is no impropriety in reckoning
   this amongst the other blessings which enhance the value of the
   Sabbath, although it is a portion of the Second Table. And we know that
   this rude people required to be attracted by every possible means to
   present cheerfully to God the worship due to Him. The sum therefore is,
   that they were thus to testify not only their piety towards God, but
   also their kindness towards their servants. I have already shewn that
   their authority as masters was to be exercised in moderation by them,
   if they were mindful of their former condition:, since they also had
   been servants in Egypt. If any one should suppose that the argument
   does not hold good, because; they were oppressed by cruel and dreadful
   tyranny, the reply is easy, that so much the better could they
   determine from their own feelings how detestable and intolerable a
   thing cruelty is.

   Exodus 31

   Exodus 31:12-17

   12. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   12. Dixit praeterea Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   13. Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
   sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout
   your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth
   sanctify you.

   13. Et tu alloquere filios Israel, dicendo: Veruntamen Sabbatha mea
   custodietis: qnia signum eat inter me et vos in generationibus vestris,
   ut sciatis quod sum Jehova sanctiffcans vos.

   14. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every
   one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth
   any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

   14. Custodietis igitur Sabbathum, quia sanctitus est vobis: quisquis
   profanaverit illud moriendo morietur: quia omnis faciens in eo opus,
   excidetur anima ipsa e medio populorum suorum.

   15. Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of
   rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he
   shall surely be put to death.

   15. Sex diebus fiet opus: at die septimo Sabbathum cessationis est,
   sanctitas Jehovae: quicunque fecerit opus die Sabbathi, moriendo
   morietur.

   16. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe
   the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

   16. Observabunt itaque filii Israel Sabbathum, observando ipsum in
   generationibus suis, pactum est perpetuum.

   17. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in
   six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he
   rested, and was refreshed.

   17. Inter me et filios Israel signum est in perpetuum: quia sex diebus
   fecit Jehova coelos et terrain, die autem septimo cessavit et
   requievit.


   13. Speak thou also unto the children of Israel. He inculcates the same
   things as before, with the addition of a few words, such as "for it is
   holiness unto you;" [337] by which expression he exhorts them to
   observe this rite as most sacred and inviolable, since by its neglect
   religion would fall [338] And therefore he denounces capital punishment
   against any who should work on that day. Hence, again, we gather the
   dignity and excellency of the mystery, when God deemed an apparently
   light transgression of it worthy of death. Still this was an act of by
   no means excusable contempt, to overthrow professedly, as it were, what
   God would have to be a mark of distinction between His people and
   heathen nations. The passages which follow have the same tendency,
   which it would have been superfluous to repeat, unless because the
   people were thus reminded that it was a matter of the utmost
   importance. By prohibiting them from lighting a fire, He anticipates
   all the glosses which they would have been ready enough to invent; for
   they would have alleged that if the pot had been put on the fire the
   day before, the Sabbath would not have been violated by lighting the
   fire. What, then, would have been more allowable than anything else God
   excludes, viz., that they should not employ themselves in the
   preparation of their food, or undertake any other earthly work, however
   venial. When He calls it a "perpetual" or eternal "covenant," the Jews
   rest on it as a ground of their obstinacy, and wantonly rave against
   Christ as a covenant-breaker, because He abrogated the Sabbath. I will
   not contend with them as to the word gvlm, gnolam, which sometimes
   means a long time, and not perpetuity: I will simply insist on the
   thing itself. Whatever was spoken of under the Law as eternal, I
   maintain to have had reference to the new state of things which came to
   pass at the coming of Christ; and thus the eternity of the Law must not
   be extended beyond the fullness of time, when the truth of its shadows
   was manifested, and God's covenant assumed a different form. If the
   Jews cry out that what is perpetual, and what is temporary, are
   contraries to each other, we must deny it in various respects, since
   assuredly what was peculiar to the Law could not continue to exist
   beyond the day of Jesus Christ. Besides, the Sabbath, although its
   external observation is not now in use, still remains eternal in its
   reality, like circumcision. Thus the stability of both was best
   confirmed by their abrogation; since, if God now required the same of
   Christians, it would be putting a veil over the death and resurrection
   of His Son; and hence the more carefully the Jews persevere in the
   keeping the festival, the more do they derogate from its sanctity. But
   they calumniate us falsely, as if we disregarded the Sabbath; because
   there is nothing which more completely confirms its reality and
   substance than the abolition of its external use. To this point also
   may my readers apply what I have written on Genesis 17, [339] lest I
   should weary them in vain by my prolixity; and again, in treating of
   the sacrifices, I have adverted to some things which relate to the same
   doctrine. When, in Exodus 34, God especially commands them to rest "in
   earing-time and harvest," [340] it is not as if He would let loose the
   rein for the rest of the year; but He rather draws it tighter, since no
   necessity must interrupt this sacred observance. Else it might have
   seemed a just pretext, if, on account of continued rains, or other
   ungenial weather, ploughing should be difficult, husbandmen were to be
   released from the obligation of the law, lest their resting should have
   produced sterility. The same opinion might have prevailed as to the
   ingathering of the harvest, lest it should have been spoilt on the
   ground. God, however, allows of no dispensation; but the Sabbath is to
   be observed, though at the risk of general loss.

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:10, 11

   10. And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
   fruits thereof:

   10. Sex annis seres terram tuam et congregabis fructus ejus:

   11. But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the
   poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field
   shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with
   thy oliveyard.

   11. Anno autem septimo omittes eam, et quiescere sines, ut comedant
   pauperes populi tui, et residuum comedant bestiae agri. Ita facies
   vineae et oliveto tuo.


   10. And six years shalt thou sow. Another Sabbatical institution
   (Sabbathismus) follows, viz., that of years, in reference to the
   cultivation of the land; for as men and cattle rested on every seventh
   day, so God prescribed that the earth should rest on the seventh year.
   According to the fertility or barrenness of the soil, fields are
   fallowed every third or fourth year, lest they should become altogether
   unproductive through exhaustion. Indeed a soil can hardly be found of
   such fecundity as to be fitted for continual productiveness. Some
   relaxation is therefore given, until the land recovers its vigor; but
   this only pertains to wheat, barley, pease, beans, and other pulse, and
   seeds. As to meadows and vineyards the state of things is different,
   since, when meadows are mown every year, the fertility of the soil is
   not weakened; whilst vines degenerate unless they are cultivated. It
   was a sign of extraordinary and exceeding fertility that the land of
   Canaan could bear six years' sowing following, without being worn out.
   God honored it with this privilege in favor of His people; nor did He
   indeed ordain the rest from necessity, since on the sixth year He
   doubled the power of His blessing; but in order that the sanctity of
   the Sabbath might be everywhere conspicuous, and that thus the children
   of Israel, as they looked upon the land, might be the more encouraged
   to its observance. The nature of the rest was that they should not sow
   anything, nor prune their vineyards in the sacred year; and if anything
   should spring up from the scattered seeds of last harvest, it was the
   common property of the inhabitants of the land and strangers, although
   He peculiarly bestowed whatever grew of itself, whether corn or grapes,
   upon the poor, as a kind of gratuitous present for the relief of their
   wants. And this kindness and liberality was a kind of incidental
   adjunct to the performance of the religious duty. It was not indeed
   mainly or chiefly God's purpose to give relief to the poor, but, as we
   said before, there was nothing strange in it that the offices of
   charity should be consequent upon God's service.

   If ungodly men should foolishly object that there is no connection
   between the senseless soil and a spiritual mystery, we have already
   answered, that although the Sabbath was deposited with believers only
   as a pledge of an inestimable blessing, still tokens of it appeared
   both in the flocks and herds, as well as in dead creatures, in order to
   renew the recollection of it, lest the people should grow cold, and
   their devotion should become languid. But if they mockingly persist
   that the Jews were finely dealt with, [341] when in their highest
   privilege they had asses and oxen, as well as the fields themselves,
   for companions; I answer, why do they not apply the same scoff to a
   commoner matter? For since the doctrine of salvation is committed to
   paper or parchment before it comes to us, why do they not laugh with
   all their might at the obedience of our faith? since in our silly
   credulity we embrace the promises transmitted to us by a stinking skin
   or some other filthy material? God would have the observation of the
   Sabbath engraved on all creatures, that wherever the Jews turned their
   eyes they might be kept up to it. Why, then, should not the earth be a
   conspicuous and impressive sign (character) for the rude inculcation of
   this doctrine? When it is said, "What they leave the beasts of the
   field shall eat," the injunction does not extend to wild and noxious
   animals which they might drive away from their property; but God merely
   commands that whatever the earth produced should be exposed
   promiscuously for the food both of man and beast. And this affords an
   indirect answer to a question that might occur for God shews that the
   grass would not be lost, although there should be no hay-making; for
   the grass would be instead of hay for the beasts, so that they might
   feed abundantly in the fields and meadows.

   Another question, however, arises from the passage in Leviticus, where
   God permits the owners of the land and their families to gather for
   food whatever shall then grow of itself. But there was nothing to
   prevent them, like the strangers, and anybody else, from eating of the
   fruits which were common to all, provided they did not defraud the poor
   by their covetousness. [342] The same thing is soon afterwards added in
   the description of the Jubilee; for although that year, which completed
   seven times seven years, was more holy than the rest, still God allows
   all to eat in it the fruits grown of themselves. He speaks more
   restrictedly in Exodus, in order to inculcate greater liberality upon
   them; but in Leviticus He shews that there is no danger of any of the
   produce of the land being lost, because permission is given both for
   themselves and their servants and cattle, besides the hireling and the
   stranger, to partake of it. Where He says, "that which groweth of its
   own accord of thy harvest," I understand it of the land which they
   usually reaped; as also a little further on He calls their peculiar
   right of ownership in their vines "their separation." [343] Although,
   therefore, the possessor might boast that the property was his own, and
   consequently that the harvest should be left entirely to himself, God
   reminds them that its fruits were nevertheless common to all during the
   Sabbatical year. The word "harvest," therefore, is applied to the land
   which was sown, and "separation" to the private vineyard, or its fruit.
   The old interpreter has translated them "the grapes of first-fruits."
   If it is preferred to adopt this sense, Moses would expressly declare
   that no oblation of them conferred on the owners of the property a
   right to claim as their own what grew in their vineyard (during the
   year;) [344] else it would have been a good excuse to offer to God the
   first-fruits of the vintage, and under this pretext for the Jews to
   contend that they had consecrated the whole produce in the
   first-fruits. But God anticipates this gloss, by shewing that what was
   said respecting the ordinary cultivation was improperly turned aside to
   the extraordinary year of rest. But since the word n'zyr, nazir, means
   "separation," I do not see why we should change what accords very well.
   Still commentators differ as to the meaning of this word; some
   understand it "relinquishing," because every owner resigned his private
   property, so that the vintage might be common. Others explain it as
   expressing that they had abstained from its cultivation for that year.
   My own opinion, however, as I have said, is simply that the peculiar
   right of the possessor is called his "separation;" so that it was not
   lawful for others to touch the vintage except in the Sabbatical year.
   Thus separation is opposed to common fields free to the public.

   Leviticus 25

   Leviticus 25:1-7, 20-22

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

   1. Loquntus est Jehova ad Mosen in monte Sinai, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
   into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto
   the LORD.

   2. Alloquere filios Israel, et dic illis, Quum veneritis in terram quam
   ego do vobis, sabbathizet terra quiete Jehovae.

   3. Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune
   thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

   3. Sex annis seminabis agrum tuum, et sex annis putabis vineam tuam, et
   fructum ejus colliges.

   4. But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a
   sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy
   vineyard.

   4. Septimo autem cessatio quietis erit terrae, sabbathum Jehovae: agrum
   tuum non seminabis, nec vineam putabis.

   5. That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not
   reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year
   of rest unto the land.

   5. Quae sponte gignet terra in messe tua non metes, et uvas
   possessionis tuae non vindemiabis: annus enim quietis terrae est.

   6. And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for
   thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy
   stranger that sojourneth with thee,

   6. Sed erunt vobis in cibum, tibi et servo tuo, ancillae, et
   mercenario, et inquilino tuo qui peregrinatur apud to.

   7. And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall
   all the increase thereof be meat.

   7. Jumentis quoque tuis et pecoribus terrae tuae erit cunctis ejus
   proventus in cibum.

   20. And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we
   shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

   20. Quod si dixeritis, Quid edemus anno septimo, si neque seminabimus,
   nec colligemus fruges nostras?

   21. Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it
   shall bring forth fruit for three years.

   21. Ego mandabo benedictionem meam anno sexto, et edet provenrum tribus
   annis.

   22. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
   the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.

   22. Seminabitis anno octavo: comedetis tamen e proventu vetere usque ad
   annum nonum: donec nova nascantur comedetis vetera.


   20. And if ye shall say. Men will never be obedient to God's precepts,
   unless their distrust of Him is corrected, and will be always ingenious
   in laying hold of pretexts for disobedience. The difficulty, however,
   in this matter was a specious excuse for the Jews; for famine might
   have destroyed them in these two years, since in the seventh year they
   neither sowed nor reaped; and for reaping they were obliged to wait
   till the end of the eighth year. Now, whence were they to get seed
   enough to sow after the land had rested for a whole year? It is not
   without reason, then, that God delivers them from this doubt, promising
   them that He will give such abundance in the sixth year as shall
   suffice for the two following ones. The phrase must be observed, that
   God would "command His blessing" in an especial manner, and beyond the
   usual course, so that the land should be twice or thrice more fertile.
   Hence is suggested to us no ordinary ground of confidence in asking for
   our daily bread. But this was a special promise, that food should not
   fail the Jews on account of the Sabbatical year; a manifestation of
   which God had already given in the desert, when supplied a double
   portion of manna to those who gathered it on the day before the
   Sabbath. Now-a-days this inconvenience is avoided by the industry of
   farmers, who so divide their acres that the land should never lie
   fallow altogether, but that one part should supply the deficiency of
   another. This distribution did not obtain with the Jews. Therefore God
   relieved them from the fear of famine down to the harvest of the eighth
   year; although He seems at the same time to accustom them to frugality,
   lest they should waste in intemperance and luxury what He afforded in
   sufficient abundance to last for two years. To this precept He alludes,
   when He declares by the Prophets that the land "enjoyed her Sabbaths,"
   when it had vomited forth its inhabitants, (2 Chronicles 36:21;) for
   since they had polluted it by violating the Sabbath, so that it groaned
   as if under a heavy burden, He says that it shall rest for a long
   continuous period, so as to compensate for the labor of many years.

   The Year of Jubilee

   Leviticus 25

   Leviticus 25:8-13

   8. And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times
   seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto
   thee forty and nine years.

   8. Numerabis quoque tibi septem hebdomadas armorum, id est septem annos
   septem vicibus; qui quidem dies septem Sabbathorum annorum efficient
   tibi quadraginta novem annos.

   9. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
   tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make
   the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

   9. Tunc transire facies tubam jubilationis mense septimo die mensis, id
   est die expiationum: transire inquam, facietis tubam per universam
   terrain vestram.

   10. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
   throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
   jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and
   ye shall return every man unto his family.

   10. Sanctificabitisque annum quinquagesimum, et proclamabitis
   libertatem in terra cunctis habitatoribus ejus: Jobel ipse erit vobis:
   et revertemini quisque ad possessionem suam, et quisque ad familiam
   suam revertemini.

   11. A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
   neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes
   in it of thy vine undressed.

   11. Jobel ipse annus quinquaginta annorum erit vobis: non seretis,
   neque metetis quae sponte produxerit terra: neque vindemiabitis
   separationes ejus.

   12. For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the
   increase thereof out of the field.

   12. Quia Jobel est, sanctus erit vobis, agri comedetis fructum.

   13. In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
   possession.

   13. Anno Jobel isto revertemini singuli ad possessionem suam.


   8. And thou shalt number seven. The third kind of Sabbath follows,
   which was composed of forty-nine, or seven times seven years. This was
   the most illustrious Sabbath, since the state of the people, both as to
   their persons and their houses and property, was renewed; and although
   in this way God had regard to the public good, gave relief to the poor,
   so that their liberty should not be destroyed, and preserved also the
   order laid down by Himself; still there is no question but that He thus
   added an additional stimulus to incite the Jews to honor the Sabbath.
   For it was a kind of imposing memorial of the sacred rest, to see
   slaves emancipated and become suddenly free; houses and lands returning
   to their former possessors who had sold them; and in fine all things
   assuming a new face. They called this year Jobel, from the sound of the
   ram's horn, whereby liberty and the restitution of property were
   proclaimed; but as I have said, its main feature was the solemnity
   which shewed them to be separated from other nations to be a peculiar
   and holy nation to God; nay, the renewal of all things had reference to
   this, that being redeemed anew in the great Sabbath, they might
   entirely devote themselves to God their Deliverer.

   Leviticus 23

   Leviticus 23:1-44

   1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the
   feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations,
   even these are my feasts.

   2. Alloquere filios Israel, et die illis, Hae sunt feriae quas
   vocabitis convocationes sanctas, hae sunt solennitates meae.

   3. Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of
   rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the
   sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

   3. Sex diebus fiet opus, die autem septimo Sabbathum est quietis,
   convocatio sancta: nullum opus facietis: Sabbathum est Jehovae in
   cunctis habitationibus vestris.

   4. These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye
   shall proclaim in their seasons.

   4. Hae sunt feriae quas celebrabitis: hae sunt feriae Jehovae sanctae,
   quas celebrabitis temporibus suis.

   5. In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S
   passover.

   5. Mense primo, quartadecima mensis, ad vesperam Pesah Jehovae est.

   6. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
   unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened
   bread.

   6. Quintodecimo autem die mensis hujus, solennitas erit infermentatorum
   Jehovae, septem diebus infermentata comedetis.

   7. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
   servile work therein.

   7. Die primo convocatio sancta erit vobis: nullum opus servile
   facietis.

   8. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven
   days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
   work therein.

   8. Offeretis autem oblationem ignitam Jehovae septem diebus: die
   septimo erit convocatio sancta, nullum opus servile facietis.

   9. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   9. Adhaec loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   10. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
   come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest
   thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest
   unto the priest:

   10. Alloquere filios Israel, et dic eis, Quum ingressi fueritis terrain
   quam ego do vobis, et messueritis messem ejus, tunc offeretis omnes
   primitias messis vestrae ad sacerdotem.

   11. And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for
   you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

   11. Qui offert omer coram Jehova, ut sit acceptum pro vobis: in
   crastino Sabbathi offerer illud sacerdos.

   12. And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
   without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

   12. Facietisque die quo offeretis omer, agnum integrum anniculum, in
   holocaustum Jehovae:

   13. And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
   flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a
   sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the
   fourth part of an hin.

   13. Et minham ejus, duas decimas similae permistae oleo, oblationem
   ignitam Jehovae in odorem quietis: et libamen ejus vini quattam partem
   hin.

   14. And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears,
   until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God:
   it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your
   dwellings.

   14. Panem vero et polentam, et spicam plenam non comedetis usque ad
   hunc ipsum diem, donec obtuleris munus Dei vestri: statutum perpetuum
   erit in generationibus vestris, in cunctis habitaculis vestris.

   15. And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from
   the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths
   shall be complete:

   15. Numerabitis autem vobis dies a postero die Sabbathi, a die qua
   obtuleris omer elevationis, septem hebdomades plenae erunt.

   16. Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
   fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.

   16. Usque ad posterum diem Sabbathi septimi numerabitis quinquaginta
   dies, et offeretis oblationem novam Jehovae.

   17. Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
   deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven;
   they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

   17. Ex habitaculis vestris offeretis panem oblationis: duae ex dunbus
   decimis similae erunt: cum fermento coquentur primitiae Jehovae.

   18. And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of
   the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for
   a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering and their
   drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto
   the LORD.

   18. Offeretisque cum pane illo septem agnos integros anniculos, et
   juvencum filium bovis unum, et arietes duos, erunt holocaustum Jehovae:
   et oblatio eorum libaminaque eorum, oblatio ignita erit odoris quietis
   Jehovae.

   19. Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,
   and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

   19. Facietis quoque hircum caprarum unum pro peccato, et duos agnos
   anniculos in sacrificium prosperitatum.

   20. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits,
   for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be
   holy to the LORD for the priest.

   20. Offeretque sacerdos illa ultra panem primitiarum, elevationem coram
   Jehova cum duobus agnis, sanctitas erunt Jehovae sacerdoti.

   21. And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy
   convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be
   a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

   21. Et celebrabitis hoc ipso die celebritatem, convocatio sancta erit
   vobis: nullum opus servile facietis: statutum perpetuum erit in cunctis
   habitaculis vestris, in generationibus vestris.

   22. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
   clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither
   shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: ...

   22. Et cum messueritis messem terrae vestrae, non complebis angulum
   agri tui in messe tua: nec quod residuum erit in messe tua colliges.

   23. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   23. Loquutus est praeterea Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   24. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in
   the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of
   blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

   24. Alloquere filios Israel, dicendo, Mense septimo, primo die ejusdem
   erit vobis Sabbathum monimentum clangoris, convocatio sancta.

   25. Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering
   made by fire unto the LORD.

   25. Nullum opus servile facietis, et offeretis oblationem ignitam
   Jehovae.

   26. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   26. Loquutus est quoque Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   27. Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
   atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall
   afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

   27. Veruntamen (vel, utique) in decimo mensis hujus septimi, dies
   expiationum erit: convocatio sancta erit vobis, afiligetisque animas
   vestras, et offeretis sacrificium ignitum Jehovae.

   28. And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
   atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

   28. Nullum opus facietis hoc ipso die, quid dies expiationum est ad
   expiandum vos (vel, super vos, ant pro vobis) coram Jehova Deo vestro.

   29. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same
   day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

   29. Omnis enim anima quae non fuerit afflicta eo ipso die, excidetur e
   populis suis.

   30. And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the
   same soul will I destroy from among his people.

   30. Et quisquis fecerit quodcunque opus eo ipso die, perdam animam
   illam e medio populi.

   31. Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
   throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

   31. Nullum opus facietis: statutum perpetuum erit in generationibus
   vestris, in cunctis habitationibus vestris.

   32. It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your
   souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even,
   shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

   32. Sabbathum quietis est vobis, et affligetis animas vestras nona
   mensis in vespera: a vespera usque ad vesperam quiescetis in Sabbatho
   vestro.

   33. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   33. Loquutus est et Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   34. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of
   this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days
   unto the LORD.

   34. Alloquere filios Israel, dicendo, Decimo quinto die mensis septimi
   hujus, solennitas tabernaculorum erit septem diebus Jehovah.

   35. On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
   servile work therein.

   35. Die primo erit convocatio sancta, nullum opus servile facietis.

   36. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD:
   on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall
   offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly;
   and ye shall do no servile work therein.

   36. Septem diebus offeretis sacrificium ignitum Jehovae, die octavo
   convocatio sancta erit vobis, et offeretis sacrificium ignitum Jehovah,
   solennitas est, nullum opus servile facietis.

   37. These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be
   holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a
   burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,
   every thing upon his day:

   37. Istae sunt festivitates Jehovae quas vocabitis convocationes
   sanctas, ut offeratis in els sacrificium ignitum Jehovae, holocaustum
   et oblationem, sacrificium et libamina suo quodque die.

   38. Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside
   all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give
   unto the LORD.

   38. Praeter Sabbatha Jehovae, et praeter dona vestra, praeterque omnia
   vota vestra, et praeter omnes spontaneas oblationes vestras, quas
   dabitis Jehovae.

   39. Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
   gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD
   seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day
   shall be a sabbath.

   39. Veruntamen (vel, utique) decimo quinto die mensis septimi, quando
   congregaveritis fructum terrae, celebrabitis celebritatem Jehovae
   septem diebus: die primo erit Sabbathum, die quoque octavo erit
   Sabbathum.

   40. And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
   branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of
   the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.

   40. Sumetisque vobis die primo fructum arboris decorae, et ramos
   palmarum, et ramos arboris densarum frondium, et salices torrentis, et
   laetabimini coram Jehova Deo vestro septem diebus.

   41. And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.
   It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate
   it in the seventh month.

   41. Celebrabitis, inquam, istam celebritatem Jehovae septem diebus
   quotannis: statutum perpetuum erit in generationibus vestris, mense
   septimo celebrabitis illam.

   42. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born
   shall dwell in booths:

   42. In tabernaculis habitabitis septem diebus: onmis indigena ex
   Israele habitabit in tabernaculis.

   43. That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel
   to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am
   the LORD your God.

   43. Ut sciant generationes vestrae quod in tabernaculis habitare feci
   filios Israel quando eduxi eos e terra Aegypti: ego Jehova Deus vester.

   44. And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
   LORD.

   44. Loquutus est igitur Moses de solennitatibus Jehovae ad filios
   Israel.


   4. These are the feasts of the Lord. The other festivals which Moses
   here enumerates have an affinity to the Sabbath. In the first place the
   Passover is put, the mystery of which I have annexed, not without
   reason, to the First Commandment, for its institution was there
   explained, inasmuch as it acted as a restraint on the people from
   falling away to strange gods. In that rite they were initiated to the
   service of God, that they might abandon all the superstitions of the
   Gentiles, and acquiesce in the pure instruction of the Law. The
   Passover, therefore, in itself was a supplement to the First
   Commandment; yet the day recurring from year to year is fitly
   enumerated amongst the other festivals. And surely it is plain that the
   Fourth Commandment had no other object or use except to exercise the
   people in the service of God; but since the killing of the lamb
   represented the grace of adoption whereby God had bound them to
   Himself, it was necessary to annex it to the First Commandment. Let my
   readers therefore now be content with the other part, i.e., that its
   annual celebration was a help to the perpetual recollection by the
   Israelites of their redemption.

   10. When ye be come to the land. Moses now lays down rules as to the
   second day of festival, which was dedicated to the offering of the
   first-fruits. The ceremony is described that they should deliver a
   handful into the hand of the priest; though some think that the measure
   is signified which was the tenth part of an Ephah. The word Omer [345]
   means both. But in this passage the expression "handful" is most
   appropriate, since it represented in a lively manner the beginning of
   the harvest; inasmuch as it was not lawful to taste even of parched
   grain before the offering of the firstfruits. The priest lifted it up
   before the altar, but with a waving motion; for thus the Hebrews
   distinguish between the two modes, [346] trvmh, therumah, which was
   lifted up, and tnvphh, thenuphah, which is mentioned here, and which
   was waved towards the four points of the compass, and then a sacrifice
   and libation were made. We know that heathen nations [347] thus
   invented gods and goddesses presiding over the fruits, so that the
   earth was the great and common mother of gods and men. Into this error
   the Jews would have straightway fallen, or would have gorged themselves
   without thinking about God, unless they had been reminded by this
   ceremony that the Father of their subsistence was in heaven, whose
   minister the earth was for providing their food. For since the whole
   harvest was consecrated in the single handful, it was as if they had
   shewn that whatever the earth produced altogether belonged to God. But
   thus the admirable goodness of God was conspicuous, when, in claiming
   what was His own, He did not at all diminish the food of the people;
   afterwards they received, as if from His hand, whatever each individual
   had stored at home, just as though it had come out of His sanctuary.
   Paul's statement is well known, "For if the first-fruit be holy, the
   lump is also holy," (Romans 11:16,) wherein he alludes to this ancient
   ceremony of the Law. The word which they translate "unto your
   acceptance," [348] is the same which interpreters elsewhere render
   "good pleasure," and refer to the people, as if it were said, "at your
   own will," or "ad libitum," as it is barbarously said. But I have
   before shewn that it must be understood of the favor and good-will of
   God, although it is transferred in a passive sense to the people, as in
   Psalm 106:4, rtsvn, ratson, or the favor of the chosen people, means
   the gratuitous love wherewith God regards His Church. But Moses
   signifies that the fruits of the earth cannot otherwise be eaten with a
   clear conscience, because they would not feel that God accepted them,
   and looked upon them with paternal affection. The ceremony, now
   abolished, still remains in full force amongst us as regards its
   substance, for nothing but the acknowledgment of God's bounty, which
   springs from faith and thanksgiving, sanctifies whatever we receive of
   His hand.

   Next to the first-fruits comes the feast of seven weeks, which the
   Greeks have rendered Pentecost, having reference to the same object;
   for after they had offered the first-fruits from the standing harvest,
   they added another token of gratitude in the shape of the loaves and
   the greater sacrifice. It must however be observed, that the two loaves
   are required of every family, and that they consist of two-tenths; but
   that the sacrifices of seven lambs, one bullock, and two rams, and also
   of a goat and two lambs, is enjoined upon the whole people. This is in
   fact the legitimate acknowledgment of God's liberality, because the
   waving of the sheaf, as being performed in haste, was but a trifling
   one; since we have seen that before they touched the grain, God
   required that the first-fruits should be offered to Him, until at
   leisure and in a more convenient season they might more fully discharge
   their duty. Thus what we have above observed respecting the
   first-fruits, was only a preparation for the day of Pentecost, on which
   the holy oblation was not ears of wheat, but loaves made of the new
   wheat.

   24. In the seventh month, in the first day of the month. I wonder how
   it ever entered the mind of the Jews [349] that in the feast of
   trumpets the deliverance of Isaac was commemorated, when a goat was
   substituted to be slain in his stead; [350] but they have invented this
   with their wonted audacity. Surely it is as baseless as it is
   unreasonable. Others more rightly suppose that it was a preparation for
   the approaching feast of atonement, on account of the slight interval
   of time; for since this day is distinguished by no peculiar mark, it is
   probable that it ought not to be separated from the other which follows
   soon afterwards, viz., on the tenth day. Unless, perhaps, it is more
   probable that they were thus called together once a year by the sound
   of trumpets, first of all, that they might learn that all their sacred
   assemblies were appointed by the voice of God; and secondly, that this
   His voice was thus renewed, that they might always be ready to obey
   Him. And this seems to signify by the expression, "a memorial of
   blowing of trumpets;" as if He had said that the trumpets sounded in
   their ears once a year, that they might be attentive to God's voice
   throughout their lives, and ever willing to follow whithersoever He
   should command them to go. Others think that the trumpets sounded at
   the beginning of the month, that they might prepare themselves for the
   three festivals, and also because this month was remarkable both in the
   Sabbatical year and in the Jubilee. But what, if when God displaced
   this month from being the beginning of the year to stand seventh, He
   chose to leave it some traces of its original dignity? for by general
   consent it is admitted that, until the people came out of Egypt, this
   was the first month. Some even think that the world was created in it,
   which is not without probable show of reason. And the Jews now also, in
   political matters and in things which relate to this earthly life,
   retain this original computation in accordance with unbroken custom: it
   is only in sacred matters that they commence the year in March. This
   indeed seems to me the probable reason why, on the day now referred to,
   God renewed the memory of His dominion by a solemn proclamation, and
   assigned this seventh month both to the Jubilee and the Sabbatical
   year. [351] The solemnity was completed in one day, differing very
   little from an ordinary Sabbath, except by the trumpet-blowing and the
   sacrifice, as is described in Numbers 29. For Moses there speaks of
   more than he does here; he there enumerates a calf, a ram, seven lambs,
   a goat for a sin-offering, with its accompaniments, besides the
   burnt-offering of the new moon, and commands an offering to be made by
   fire of them all. Here he speaks generally in a single word.

   27. Also on the tenth day of this seventh month. The word kphr, caphar,
   whence the noun kphrym, cephurim, signifies both to propitiate and to
   blot out guilt and accusation by means of expiation; kphrym, therefore,
   are atonements (libationes) for appeasing God; and the word is used in
   the plural number, because they were not under the imputation of a
   single kind of guilt, but had need of manifold reconciliations on
   account of their many and various transgressions. This was indeed done
   both publicly and privately throughout the rest of the year, for all
   the victims they offered were so many satisfactions in order to obtain
   pardon and to reconcile God. Still to these daily exercises was added
   also a yearly feast-day as a special memorial, and as a sharper spur to
   repentance: for it was fit that they should be stirred up to pious
   grief by solemn fasting and sacrifices, inasmuch as they had provoked
   God's wrath against themselves through the whole year. Therefore on
   this feast-day they were cited before His tribunal, in order that,
   placing themselves there, they should acknowledge that they deserved
   this judgment, and yet prayed that they might escape punishment; and
   this was the object of the fast. Meanwhile they learnt from the
   sacrifices that they were restored to His favor, since simple
   confession would have been only a ground for despair. Thus, therefore,
   God required of them sorrow and other indications of penitence, that on
   His part He might testify that He was duly appeased so as to be
   propitious to them. The expression, "ye shall afflict your souls," here
   refers to the fast, which was required as an outward profession of
   repentance. And assuredly there was no weight in the fast of itself,
   since God plainly shews through Isaiah that He makes no account of
   hypocrites, who trust that they appease him by fasting, (Isaiah 58:3;)
   but being withdrawn from mere luxurious food and all delicacies, they
   were reminded of their misery, so that being cast down by grief and
   humbled, they might more ardently and zealously seek for the remedy.
   For remission of sins is promised to none but those who, affected with
   serious sorrow, feel themselves to be lost and miserable, and
   acknowledge and confess what they have deserved. In this way a door is
   opened for imploring God's mercy. Still it is not to be supposed that
   those who are thus dissatisfied with themselves deserve pardon by their
   preparation for it. [352] But since it would be contrary to God's
   nature to embrace men with His favor who are plunged in their
   iniquities and obstinate in sin; and again, since it would be most
   unreasonable that by His clemency license to sin should be given under
   the pretext of impunity, it is needful that penitence should precede
   our reconciliation to God. Whence also it appears that He so pardons
   sinners as still to hate their sins, since He only absolves those who
   voluntarily condemn themselves, nor admits any into His favor except
   those who forsake their sins; not that any one perfectly renounces
   himself or his sins, but through indulgence that penitence is
   acceptable to God, [353] which might justly be rejected on the ground
   of its deficiencies. Whereby also what I have just said is confirmed,
   that it is not on account of the merit of our penitence that God
   acquits us of our sins; as if we redeemed ourselves from guilt and
   punishment by weeping, sorrowing, and confession, whereas in the best
   of us all penitence will always be found to be weak and imperfect.
   Wherefore the cause and the honor of our pardon must only be ascribed
   to the gratuitous goodness of God. Hence I have said that in their fast
   the Israelites professed their guilt and condemnation, whilst they were
   expiated by the sacrifice, since there is no other means of
   satisfaction.

   29. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted. Hence let us
   learn how greatly the sacrifice of an afflicted and humbled heart
   pleases God; since He commands so severe a punishment to be inflicted
   for the contempt of this ceremony. And surely this would have been a
   proof of most gross indifference, if, when God was inspiring men with
   the dread of His wrath, and inviting them to tears, they should rest in
   security and ease, and give themselves up to luxuries. On this account
   He declares with a terrible oath in Isaiah, that will never pardon the
   Jews, to whom the hour of repentance never came, but, when he
   reprovingly called upon them by His prophets to make haste "to weeping,
   and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth,"
   merrily feasted and drank together, and said, "Let us eat and drink,
   for to-morrow we die." (Isaiah 22:12-14.) And no wonder, since this is
   the extreme height of impiety, to stupify our consciences in brutal
   contumacy, and to rob God of His judicial power. As long as the sinner
   is so far affected, and pricked by a sense of sins, as anxiously to
   sigh for a remedy, there is some hope of his recovery; whilst he who
   shakes off fear as well as shame, is in altogether a desperate state.
   Now, since it was not without reason that God exercised His ancient
   people under the Law with external rudiments, it was an act of profane
   and intolerable carelessness to omit what was so necessary; and of
   still greater hardness of heart purposely, as it were, to despise it,
   so that no one need wonder at the severity of the punishment. In
   Numbers 29 the number of the victims is stated; but I pass over this
   point, as not requiring to be expounded.

   34. The fifteenth day of this seventh month. It is shewn in the end of
   the chapter why God instituted the Feast of Tabernacles, viz, that the
   children of Israel might remember that they dwelt in tents in the
   desert, when they had no certain dwelling-place, but, as it were,
   passed a wandering life. The Passover shewed how they were marvellously
   rescued from immediate death by the hand of God; but by this other day
   God magnified the continuous and daily flow of His grace; for it would
   not have been enough to acknowledge His power in their actual
   departure, and to give Him thanks for their momentary deliverance,
   unless they reflected altogether on the progress of their perfect
   deliverance, which they had experienced during forty years. In allusion
   to this the Prophet Zechariah, when he is speaking of the second
   redemption, enjoins upon all the nations which should be converted to
   God's worship, that they should go up every year to celebrate this day.
   (Zechariah 14:16.) And why this rather than the other festivals?
   because their return from Babylon by a long and difficult journey,
   endangered by the violent assaults of enemies, would be equally
   memorable with the passage of the people from Egypt into the Promised
   Land. Hence we gather that, though the ceremony is now abolished, yet
   its use still exists in spirit and in truth, in order that the
   incomparable power and mercy of God should be constantly kept before
   our eyes, when He has delivered us from darkness and from the deep
   abyss of death, and has translated us into the heavenly life. But it
   behooved that the ancient people in their ignorance should be thus
   exercised, that all from youth to old age, going forth from their
   homes, should be brought, as it were, into the actual circumstances,
   and in that spectacle should perceive what would have else never
   sufficiently penetrated their minds; whilst at the same time they were
   instructed for the time to come, that even in the land of Canaan they
   were to be sojourners, since this is the condition prescribed to all
   the pious, and children of God, that they should be strangers on earth,
   if they desire to be inheritors of heaven. Especially, however, God
   would stir them up to gratitude, that they might more highly estimate
   their quiet occupation of the Promised Land, and the comfort of their
   houses, when they recollected that they were brought hither by His hand
   out of the desert, and from the most wretched destitution of all
   things.

   36. Seven days ye shall offer. They only kept holiday on the first and
   eighth day, yet they dwelt in huts, and for seven successive days
   offered sacrifices, of which a fuller account was elsewhere given.
   What, therefore, Moses distinctly treats of in the book of Numbers, I
   have preferred to introduce in another place, where I have spoken of
   the sacrifices in general. All are not agreed about the word I have
   translated "solemnity." [354] tsrt, gnatsereth, is derived from tsr,
   gnatsar, which means both to restrain and to gather together. Some
   interpreters, therefore, preserve the first etymology, translating it,
   "it is the retaining or prohibition of God;" but since this meaning is
   somewhat obscure, I have not hesitated to take it, as in other
   passages, for a solemnity; for, without controversy, it sometimes means
   feast days, sometimes assemblies or conventions. Let my readers,
   however, make choice of whichever sense they prefer. After Moses has
   prescribed concerning the rest and the offerings, he adds a caution,
   that there should be no diminution of the ordinary service; for else
   they might, have transferred fraudulently the sacrifices, which they
   were already obliged to offer, to the feast days, and thus, as the
   saying is, have endeavored to whitewash two walls out of the same pot.
   Wherefore, at the beginning of verse 39, the particle 'k, ac, seems to
   be taken adversatively; [355] for there is an antithesis between the
   peculiar service of this solemnity and the common rites which were to
   be observed at other times; as if he had said, that when they had done
   all which the Law required every day, still they were not to fail in
   this observance; and hence, that they must comply severally with both
   the general and special command, if they would properly do their duty.
   Moreover, by reference to the time, he shews that they ought to be
   cheerful in its performance, because they would then incur but little
   loss, as the fruits would all be harvested; and this is what he refers
   to when he says, "when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land;" as
   if he had said, that he had regard to their convenience, since
   otherwise they would have been at leisure at home; and thus he takes
   away all excuse (for neglect.)

   40. And ye shall take you on the first day. By this symbol the Jews
   were instructed that this day was to be celebrated with joy and
   gladness; for it was not only a memorial of the favor which He had
   graciously bestowed on their fathers in the desert, when they were
   exposed to all the vicissitudes of heaven, [356] and He cherished them
   under His wings as an eagle does her brood; but it was also an act of
   thanksgiving, because He had provided them so commodious a reception in
   the Promised Land; thus, by carrying the boughs, they proclaimed their
   joy and triumph as it were. Nor would it have been reasonable that they
   should go into the booths in sorrow and sadness, since they represented
   visibly to them both the former and present goodness of God, and at the
   same time gave them a foretaste of the life of heaven, inasmuch as they
   were but sojourners on earth. Some suppose hdr, hadar, [357] to be a
   proper name, but since it everywhere means "comeliness," I have been
   unwilling to depart from its ordinary sense; nor do I curiously insist
   on the words, except so far as it is necessary to ascertain the actual
   substance.

   of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall
   appear before me empty:)

   Exodus 23:14. Three times shalt thou keep a feast. It is strange that
   Moses, who elsewhere enumerates several feast-days, should here only
   command them to appear in God's presence thrice a year. Where then is
   the feast of trumpets and the day of atonement? for undoubtedly all
   were to be celebrated at Jerusalem. In the first place, it is to be
   observed that the principal ones, to which the greater honor
   appertained, are here mentioned. Secondly, because the three holidays
   in the seventh month were almost continuous, (it is probable [358] )
   that some indulgence was given them, lest they should be absent from
   their homes the whole month; for at the beginning of the month the
   trumpets sounded, on the tenth day was the solemn fast, and on the
   fifteenth they began to dwell in the booths. If the necessity of
   remaining in Jerusalem had been imposed on all, so long a stay would
   have been burdensome. But, if they chose to be present from the
   beginning to the end, still there would have been only one journey,
   which is named after the most remarkable day. And certainly [359] the
   word rglym, raglim, which Moses uses, means, metaphorically, rather
   journeys than times, although I allow that phmym, phagnemim, which
   signifies times, is used in Deuteronomy in a similar sense. At any
   rate, it appears that God spared His people, when prescribed only three
   necessary convocations, lest the fathers of families and their children
   should be wearied by the expense and trouble of them, since he approves
   of no service which does not proceed from a cheerful heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [358] Added from Fr.

   [359] rglym and phmym each signify the feet, in their primary sense;
   and each are used, but the latter more commonly, for times, as when we
   say, "so many times." -- W It is so used in Deuteronomy 1:2, and 16:16.
   For this critical sentence, the following is substituted in Fr., "Ainsi
   trois festes y eussent este comprises; pource qu'ils ne fussent point
   retournez jusques a ce qu'elles eussent este aceomplies;" thus, three
   festivals would have been comprised in it; because they would not have
   returned until they were all completed.

   God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out
   of Egypt by night.

   1. Observa mensem Abib, et fac Pesah Jehovae Deo tuo: quia mense Abib
   eduxit to Jehova Deus tuus ex Aegypto nocte.

   quem elegerit Jehova ut habitare faciat nomen suum ibi.

   5. Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,
   which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

   5. Non poteris sacrificare Pesah in aliqua e portis tuis quas Jehova
   Deus tuus dat tibi.

   6. But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his
   name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going
   down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

   6. Sed in loco quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus ut habitare faciat nomen
   suum ibi: sacrificabis Pesah ad vesperam, occumbente sole, tempore quo

   7. And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God
   shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy
   tents.

   7. Assabis autem ac comedes in loco quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus,
   postea mane conversus reverteris in tabernacula tua.

   8. Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day
   shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work
   therein.

   8. Sex diebus comedes infermentata, die autem septimo erit solennitas
   Jehovae Deo tuo: non facies opus ullum.

   9. Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven
   weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.

   9. Septem hebdomadas numerabis tibi, ex quo ceperit falx esse in
   segete, incipies numerare septem hebdomadas.

   10. And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a
   tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give
   unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

   10. Postea celebrabis solennitatem hebdomadum Jehovae Deo tuo pro
   facultate spontaneae marius tuae quod dabis pront benedixerit tibi
   Jehova Deus tuus.

   11. And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son,
   and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
   Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless,
   and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God
   hath chosen to place his name there.

   11. Et laetaberis coram Jehova Deo tuo, tu et filius tuus et filia tua,
   et servus tuns et ancilla tua, et Levita qui est intra portas tuas, et
   peregrinus, et pupillus, et vidua, qui fuerint in medio tui, in loco
   quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus ut habitare faciat nomen suum ibi.

   12. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou
   shalt observe and do these statutes.

   12. Et recordaberis quod servus fueris in Aegypto, propterea custodies
   ac facies statuta haec.

   13. Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that
   thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

   13. Solennitatem tabernaculorum facies septem diebus, quum collegeris
   tu de area tua, et de torculari tuo.

   14. And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy
   daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
   stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.

   14. Et laetaberis in solennitate tua, tu et filius tuus et filia tua,
   et servus tuus et ancilla tua, et Levita, et peregrinus, et pupillus,
   et vidua, qui habitaverint intra portas tuas.

   15. Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in
   the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall
   bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands,
   therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

   15. Septem diebus solennitatem celebrabis Jehovae Deo tuo in loco quem
   elegerit Jehova: quum benedixerit tibi Jehova Deus tuus in cunctis
   frugibus this, et in omni opere manuum tuarum, et eris tantummodo
   laetus.

   16. Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD
   thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened
   bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and
   they shall not appear before the LORD empty:

   16. Tribus vicibus quotannis conspicietur omnis masculus tuus coram
   Jehova Deo tuo, in loco quem elegerit, in solennitate inferment atorum,
   et in solennitate hebdomadum, et in solennitate tabernaculorum, neque
   quisquam conspicietur coram Jehova vacuus.

   17. Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of
   the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

   17. Quisque secundum donum manus suae, secundum benedictionem Jehovae
   Dei tui quam dedit tibi.


   1. Observe the month Abib. For what purpose God instituted the
   Passover, has already been shewn in the exposition of the First
   Commandment; for since it was a symbol of redemption, and in that
   ceremony the people exercised themselves in the pure worship of the One
   God, so as to acknowledge Him to be their only Father, and to
   distinguish Him from all idols, I thought that the actual slaying of
   the lamb should be introduced amongst the Supplements to the First
   Commandment. It only remains for us to speak here of what relates to
   the Sabbath. This then was the first solemn day, on which God would
   have His people rest and go up to Jerusalem, forsaking all their
   business. But mention is here made not only of the Paschal Lamb, but He
   also commands sheep and oxen to be slain in the place which He should
   choose. In these words He signifies that on that day a holy convocation
   was to be held; which is soon after more clearly expressed, for I have
   already given the two intermediate verses in the institution of the
   Passover itself, He therefore prohibits their slaying the Passover
   apart in their own cities, but would have them all meet in the same
   sanctuary. It has been elsewhere said that one altar was prescribed for
   them, as if God would gather them under one banner for the preservation
   of concord and the unity of the faith. What is added respecting the
   solemnity of the seventh day is very appropriate to this place.

   9. Seven weeks shalt thou number. It must be observed that the Passover
   fell in a part of the year when the harvests were beginning to ripen;
   and consequently the first-fruits, of which I treated under the First
   Commandment, were then offered. Seven weeks afterwards they celebrated
   another feast-day, which was called Pentecost, i.e., the fiftieth, by
   the Greeks. There was just this number of days between the departure of
   the people and the publication of the Law. Another offering of
   first-fruits was then made, in which each one, according to his
   ability, and in proportion to the produce of the year, consecrated a
   gift to God of the harvested fruits. In order that they might be more
   ready and cheerful in their liberality, God's blessing is set before
   them, as if Moses had commanded the people to testify their gratitude;
   since whatever springs from the earth, is the mere bounty of God
   Himself.

   11. And thou shalt require. On another ground he exhorts and excites
   them to willingness, because the service of God brings this rejoicing;
   for there is nothing which ought more to stimulate us to obedience,
   that when we know that God rather consults our good than seeks to
   obtain any advantage from us. Ungodly men, indeed, rejoice also, nay,
   they are wanton and intemperate in their joy; but since that joy is not
   only transient, but their laughter is turned into weeping and gnashing
   of teeth, it is not without cause that Moses here magnifies it as a
   peculiar blessing, to rejoice before God; as if a father should invite
   his children to delight themselves together with him. But by this
   external exercise, believers were reminded that there is no real or
   desirable joy, unless in reference to God. And surely, however the
   wicked may exult in their pleasures, and abandon themselves to
   gratifcations, still, since tranquillity of conscience, which alone
   brings true rejoicing, is wanting to them, they do not enjoy the
   merriment into which they plunge themselves. Finally, Moses amplifies
   by a comparison the good which they enjoyed in the service of God, when
   he says, "And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt;"
   for that their present condition might be more pleasant to them, he
   heightened its sweetness by the recollection of their most miserable
   captivity. I have here neglected Cicero's [360] very subtle distinction
   between the words gaudium and laetitia, for unless I take both of them
   in a good sense, I could not translate the Hebrew words, whereby God
   would express how indulgently He deals with His children. Meanwhile,
   this passage contains an exhortation to render thanks to God our
   deliverer.

   13. Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles. Its first day was
   called the day of In-gathering, (collectionum,) because the produce of
   the whole year was then stored in their granaries [361] and provision
   cellars. Since, therefore, they then rested from their rural labors, it
   was a convenient time of year for the celebration of the festivals; for
   in order that they might more willingly go up to Jerusalem, it was
   arranged by God, that it should be done with but little expense and
   sacrifice of their domestic interests. Where our translation is, "When
   Jehovah shall have blessed thee," it stands literally, "Because he
   shall bless thee," [362] but the sense is nearly the same; for Moses
   assures them that, provided they devote their minds diligently and
   faithfully to the service of God, they shall never want grounds for
   rejoicing, since He will never interrupt the flow of His blessing. The
   end, therefore, of the fifteenth verse, is not a mere command, but also
   a promise; as if he had said, that, if they were not ungrateful, there
   was no fear but that God would continually supply new cause for
   gladness; and these two clauses are to be taken in connection, "God
   will bless thee, and, therefore, thou shalt only rejoice;" for in this
   passage I willingly interpret thus [363] the particle 'k, ak. It is
   indeed absurd to take it adversatively. It will not, therefore, be
   improper to explain it exclusively, as if he said, that, there should
   be no sorrow or anxiety, which should hinder them from the performance
   of their pious duty; those who render it "surely," approach also to
   this meaning.

   16. Three times in a year. We have previously said that although the
   other feast-days were not to be neglected, still, because God would
   make some allowance for the infirmity of His people, the necessity of
   going up to Jerusalem five times a year was not imposed upon them.
   Again, because only half of the seventh month contained three
   feast-days, i.e., from the first to the fifteenth, for the same reason
   it is only required of the males that they should leave their houses
   and celebrate the sacred convocations; for thus the females are spared,
   to whom traveling is not so convenient. Besides, through the fecundity
   promised them by God, they were almost always either pregnant or
   nursing. It is also certain that the boys and young men were excepted
   under the age of twenty, since God includes under the term males only
   those who were comprised in the census. If any object that in God's
   spiritual worship there is no difference between males and females; the
   reply is easy, that the fathers of families presented themselves there
   in the names of their wives and children: so that the profession was
   extended to the other sex, and to those of tender age. To this David
   seems to allude, when he says: [364]

   "Thy people shall come with voluntary offerings in the day of thy
   assembly, in the beauties of holiness," (Psalm 110:3;)

   for, speaking of the free-will-offerings of the people, he seeks an
   example of it, after the manner of the prophets, from the legal
   worship. Lest the Jews should object that there was danger of hostile
   invasion, if the land should be stripped of its defenses by the
   gathering together of all the men into one place, God anticipates this
   doubt in Exodus 34, promising that He will provide that no one shall
   desire to assail their forsaken homes; for to this the sentence refers:
   "I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders, so
   that no man shall desire thy land," ver. 24. Whence also we gather,
   that God's worship was not entirely established until all the
   neighboring nations were subdued, and He had placed His sanctuary in
   Mount Zion. Not that it was allowable for the people to omit the
   feast-days before that time; but that experience itself might teach
   them that God was wroth with them, whilst He deprived them of this
   special blessing; for fear and alarm arose only from their own fault.
   But let believers collect from hence the useful doctrine that, whenever
   they are following God, they will be safe under His protection, since
   it is in His power to repel the assaults of enemies, and everything
   that can harm them.

   And they shall not appear before the Lord empty, [365] I know not how
   it could have entered the minds of some to suppose that God here
   promised that all should be rich who should present themselves three
   times (a year) before His sanctuary: whereas it is plain from the words
   of Moses that He requires from every one some gift in token of their
   gratitude. And perhaps [366] what historians relate respecting the
   Persians, that none should dare to address the king without a gift, was
   a more ancient custom, and common to other nations. God would indeed
   have a gift presented Him by each individual, as a symbol or earnest of
   their subjection; and, although this legal rite has ceased, yet its
   substance is to be retained, viz., that those only are true servants of
   God who do not boastfully make a mere empty profession, but effectually
   testify that they acknowledge Him as their King.
