AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION

   To meet the wishes of my English friends I have assented to the
   publication of these Lectures in English as well as in German, and as
   my esteemed friend Mr. Bailey Saunders was so self-denying and obliging
   as to undertake the translation of them, I was sure of their being in
   the best hands. Whether there is as great a need in England as there is
   in Germany for a chord and plain statement of the Gospel and its
   history, I do not know. But this I know: the theologians of every
   country only half discharge their duties if they think it enough to
   treat of the Gospel in the recondite language of learning and bury it
   in scholarly folios.

   A. HARNACK.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   The following Lectures were delivered extempore to a class of some six
   hundred students drawn from all the Faculties in the University of
   Berlin. An enthusiastic listener took them down in shorthand, and at
   the close surprised Professor Harnack with a complete report of what he
   had said. A few alterations sufficed to transform the Lectures into a
   book, and German readers everywhere were thus happily enabled to share
   in some of the privileges of the original audience.

   I deem it an honour to have any hand in offering to my
   fellow-countrymen a similar advantage. Goethe, writing in his last
   years to Carlyle, described translators, in grandiloquent language, as
   the agents of intellectual commerce among the nations. The duty of such
   agency in regard to the contents of this volume I have done my humble
   best to discharge, convinced as I am that in the traffic in ideas
   between Germany and the English-speaking peoples all over the world
   both the matter of Professor Harnack's discourse and the spirit in
   which he treats it are alike worthy of attention.

LECTURE I

   THE great English philosopher, John Stuart Mill, has somewhere observed
   that mankind cannot be too often reminded that there was once a man of
   the name of Socrates. That is true; but still more important is it to
   remind mankind again and again that a man of the name of Jesus Christ
   once stood in their midst. The fact, of course, has been brought home
   to us from our youth up; but unhappily it cannot be said that public
   instruction in our time is calculated to keep the image of Jesus Christ
   before us in any impressive way, and make it an inalienable possession
   after our school-days are over and for our whole life. And although no
   one who has once absorbed a ray of Christ's light can ever again become
   as though he had never heard of him; although at the bottom of every
   soul that has been once touched an impression remains, a confused
   recollection of this kind, which is often only a "superstitio," is not
   enough to give strength and life. But where the demand for further and
   more trustworthy knowledge about him arises, and a man wants positive
   information as to who Jesus Christ was, and as to the real purport of
   his message, he no sooner asks for it than he finds himself, if he
   consults the literature of the day, surrounded by a clatter of
   contradictory voices. He hears some people maintaining that primitive
   Christianity was closely akin to Buddhism, and he is accordingly told
   that it is in fleeing the world and in pessimism that the sublime
   character of this religion and its profound meaning are revealed.
   Others, on the contrary, assure him that Christianity is an optimistic
   religion, and that it must be thought of simply and solely as a higher
   phase of Judaism; and these people also suppose that in saying this
   they have said something very profound. Others, again, maintain the
   opposite; they assert that the Gospel did away with Judaism, but itself
   originated under Greek influences of mysterious operation; and that it
   is to be understood as a blossom on the tree of Hellenism. Religious
   philosophers come forward and declare that the metaphysical system
   which, as they say, was developed out of the Gospel is its real kernel
   and the revelation of its secret; but others reply that the Gospel has
   nothing to do with philosophy, that it was meant for feeling and
   suffering humanity, and that philosophy has only been forced upon it.
   Finally, the latest critics that have come into the field assure us
   that the whole history of religion, morality, and philosophy, is
   nothing but wrapping and ornament; that what at all times underlies
   them, as the only real motive power, is the history of economics; that,
   accordingly, Christianity, too, was in its origin nothing more than a
   social movement and Christ a social deliverer, the deliverer of the
   oppressed lower classes.

   There is something touching in the anxiety which everyone shows to
   rediscover himself, together with his own point of view and his own
   circle of interest, in this Jesus Christ, or at least to get a share in
   him. It is the perennial repetition of the spectacle which was seen in
   the "Gnostic" movement even as early as the second century, and which
   takes the form of a struggle, on the part of every conceivable tendency
   of thought, for the possession of Jesus Christ. Why, quite recently,
   not only, I think, Tolstoi's ideas, but even Nietzsche's, have been
   exhibited in their special affinity with the Gospel; and there is
   perhaps more to be said even upon this subject that is worth attention
   than upon the connexion between a good deal of "theological" and
   "philosophical" speculation and Christ's teaching.

   But nevertheless, when taken together, the impression which these
   contradictory opinions convey is disheartening: the confusion seems
   hopeless. How can we take it amiss of anyone, if, after trying to find
   out how the question stands, he gives it up? Perhaps he goes further,
   and declares that after all the question does not matter. How are we
   concerned with events that happened, or with a person who lived,
   nineteen hundred years ago? We must look for our ideals and our
   strength to the present; to evolve them laboriously out of old
   manuscripts is a fantastic proceeding that can lead nowhere. The man
   who so speaks is not wrong; but neither is he right. What we are and
   what we possess, in any high sense, we possess from the past and by the
   past only so much of it, of course, as has had results and makes its
   influence felt up to the present day. To acquire a sound knowledge of
   the past is the business and the duty not only of the historian but
   also of everyone who wishes to make the wealth and the strength so
   gained his own. But that the Gospel. is a part of this past which
   nothing else can replace has been affirmed again and again by the
   greatest minds. "Let intellectual and spiritual culture progress, and
   the human mind expand, as much as it will; beyond the grandeur and the
   moral elevation of Christianity, as it sparkles and shines in the
   Gospels, the human mind will not advance." In these words Goethe, after
   making many experiments and labouring indefatigably at himself, summed
   up the result to which his moral and historical insight had led him.
   Even though we were to feel no desire on our own part, it would still
   be worth while, because of this man's testimony, to devote our serious
   attention to what he came to regard as so precious; and if, contrary to
   his declaration, louder and more confident voices are heard to-day,
   proclaiming that the Christian religion has outlived itself, let us
   accept that as an invitation to make a closer acquaintance with this
   religion whose certificate of death people suppose that they can
   already exhibit.

   But in truth this religion and the efforts which it evokes are more
   active to-day than they used to be. We may say to the credit of our age
   that it takes an eager interest in the problem of the nature and value
   of Christianity, and that there is more search and inquiry in regard to
   this subject now than was the case thirty years ago. Even in the
   experiments that are made in and about it, the strange and abstruse
   replies that are given to questions, the way in which it is
   caricatured, the chaotic confusion which it exhibits, nay, even in the
   hatred that it excites, a real life and an earnest endeavour may be
   traced. Only do not let us suppose that there is anything exemplary in
   this endeavour, and that we are the first who, after shaking off an
   authoritative religion, are struggling after one that shall really make
   us free and be of independent growth --a struggle which must of
   necessity give rise to much confusion and half-truth. Sixty-two years
   ago Carlyle wrote:--

   In these distracted times, when the Religious Principle, driven out of
   most Churches, either lies unseen in the hearts of good men, looking
   and longing and silently working there towards some new Revelation; or
   else wanders homeless over the world, like a disembodied soul seeking
   its terrestrial organisation, into how many strange shapes, of
   Superstition and Fanaticism, does it not tentatively and errantly cast
   itself! The higher Enthusiasm of man's nature is for the while without
   Exponent; yet does it continue indestructible, unweariedly active, and
   work blindly in the great chaotic deep: thus Sect after Sect, and
   Church after Church, bodies itself forth, and melts again into new
   metamorphosis.

   No one who understands the times in which we live can deny that these
   words sound as if they had been written to-day. But it is not with "the
   religious principle" and the ways in which it has developed that we are
   going to concern ourselves in these lectures. We shall try to answer
   the more modest but not less pressing question, What is Christianity?
   What was it? What has it become? The answer to this question may, we
   hope, also throw light by the way on the more comprehensive one, What
   is Religion, and what ought it to be to us? In dealing with religion,
   is it not after all with the Christian religion alone that we have to
   do? Other religions no longer stir the depths of our hearts.

   What is Christianity? It is solely in its historical sense that we
   shall try to answer this question here; that is to say we shall employ
   the methods of historical science, and the experience of life gained by
   studying the actual course of history. This excludes the view of the
   question taken by the apologist and the religious philosopher. On this
   point permit me to say a few words.

   Apologetics hold a necessary place in religious knowledge, and to
   demonstrate the validity of the Christian religion and exhibit its
   importance for the moral and intellectual life is a great and a worthy
   undertaking. But this undertaking must be kept quite separate from the
   purely historical question as to the nature of that religion, or else
   historical research will be brought into complete discredit. Moreover,
   in the kind of apologetics that is now required no really high standard
   has yet been attained. Apart from a few steps that have been taken in
   the direction of improvement, apologetics as a subject of study is in a
   deplorable state: it is not clear as to the positions to be defended,
   and it is uncertain as to the means to be employed. It is also not
   infrequently pursued in an undignified and obtrusive fashion,
   Apologists imagine that they are doing a great work by crying up
   religion as though it were a job-lot at a sale, or a universal remedy
   for all social ills. They are perpetually snatching, too, at all sorts
   of baubles, so as to deck out religion in fine clothes. In their
   endeavour to present it as a glorious necessity, they deprive it of its
   earnest character, and at the best only prove that it is something
   which may be safely accepted because it can do no harm. Finally, they
   cannot refrain from slipping in some church programme of yesterday and
   "demonstrating" its claims as well. The structure of their ideas is so
   loose that an idea or two more makes no difference. The mischief that
   has been thereby done already and is still being done is indescribable.
   No! the Christian religion is something simple and sublime; it means
   one thing and one thing only: Eternal life in the midst of time, by the
   strength and under the eyes of God. It is no ethical or social arcanum
   for the preservation or improvement of things generally. To make what
   it has done for civilisation and human progress the main question, and
   to determine its value by the answer, is to do it violence at the
   start. Goethe once said, "Mankind is always advancing, and man always
   remains the same." It is to man that religion pertains, to man, as one
   who in the midst of all change and progress himself never changes.
   Christian apologetics must recognise, then, that it is with religion in
   its simple nature and its simple strength that it has to do. Religion,
   truly, does not exist for itself alone, but lives in an inner
   fellowship with all the activities of the mind and with moral and
   economical conditions as well. But it is emphatically not a mere
   function or an exponent of them; it is a mighty power that sets to work
   of itself, hindering or furthering, destroying or making fruitful. The
   main thing is to learn what religion is and in what its essential
   character consists; no matter what position the individual who examines
   it may take up in regard to it, or whether in his own life he values it
   or not.

   But the point of view of the philosophical theorist, in the strict
   sense of the word, will also find no place in these lectures. Had they
   been delivered sixty years ago, it would have been our endeavour to try
   to arrive by speculative reasoning at some general conception of
   religion, and then to define the Christian religion accordingly. But we
   have rightly become sceptical about the value of this procedure. Latet
   dolus in generalibus. We know to-day that life cannot be spanned by
   general conceptions, and that there is no general conception of
   religion to which actual religions are related simply and solely as
   species to genus. Nay, the question may even be asked whether there is
   any such generic conception as "religion" at all. Is the common clement
   in it anything more than a vague disposition? Is it only an empty place
   in our innermost being that the word denotes, which everyone fills up
   in a different fashion and many do not perceive at all? I am not of
   this opinion; I am convinced, rather, that at bottom we have to do here
   with something which is common to us all, and which in the course of
   history has struggled up out of torpor and discord into unity and
   light. I am convinced that Augustine is right when he says, "Thou,
   Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our heart is restless until it
   finds rest in Thee." But to prove that this is so; to exhibit the
   nature and the claims of religion by psychological analysis, including
   the psychology of peoples, is not the task that we shall undertake in
   what follows. We shall keep to the purely historical theme: What is the
   Christian religion?

   Where are we to look for our materials? The answer seems to be simple
   and at the same time exhaustive: Jesus Christ and his Gospel. But
   however little doubt there may be that this must form not only our
   point of departure but also the matter with which our investigations
   will mainly deal, it is equally certain that we must not be content to
   exhibit the mere image of Jesus Christ and the main features of his
   Gospel. We must not be content to stop there, because every great and
   powerful personality reveals a part of what it is only when seen in
   those whom it influences. Nay, it may be said that the more powerful
   the personality which a man possesses, and the more he takes hold of
   the inner life of others, the less can the sum-total of what he is be
   known only by what he himself says and does. We must look at the
   reflection and the effects which he produced in those whose leader and
   master he became. That is why a complete answer to the question, What
   is Christianity, is impossible so long as we are restricted to Jesus
   Christ's teaching alone. We must include the first generation of his
   disciples as well those who ate and drank with him and we must listen
   to what they tell us of the effect which he had upon their lives.

   But even this does not exhaust our materials. If Christianity is an
   example of a great power valid not for one particular epoch alone; if
   in and through it, not once only, but again and again, great forces
   have been disengaged, we must include all the later products of its
   spirit. It is not a question of a "doctrine" being handed down by
   uniform repetition or arbitrarily distorted; it is a question of a
   life, again and again kindled afresh, and now burning with a flame of
   its own. We may also add that Christ himself and the apostles were
   convinced that the religion which they were planting would in the ages
   to come have a greater destiny and a deeper meaning than it possessed
   at the time of its institution; they trusted to its spirit leading from
   one point of light to another and developing higher forces. Just as we
   cannot obtain a complete knowledge of a tree without regarding not only
   its root and its stem but also its bark, its branches, and the way in
   which it blooms, so we cannot form any right estimate of the Christian
   religion unless we take our stand upon a comprehensive induction that
   shall cover all the facts of its history. It is true that Christianity
   has had its classical epoch; nay more, it had a founder who himself was
   what he taught -- to steep ourselves in him is still the chief matter;
   but to restrict ourselves to him means to take a point of view too low
   for his significance. Individual religious life was what he wanted to
   kindle and what he did kindle; it is, as we shall see, his peculiar
   greatness to have led men to God, so that they may thenceforth live
   their own life with Him. How, then, can we be silent about the history
   of the Gospel if we wish to know what he was?

   It may be objected that put in this way the problem is too difficult,
   and that its solution threatens to be accompanied by many errors and
   defects. That is not to be denied; but to state a problem in easier
   terms, that is to say in this case inaccurately, because of the
   difficulties surrounding it, would be a very perverse expedient.
   Moreover, even though the difficulties increase, the work is, on the
   other hand, facilitated by the problem being stated in a larger manner;
   for it helps us to grasp what is essential in the phenomena, and to
   distinguish kernel and husk.

   Jesus Christ and his disciples were situated in their day just as we
   are situated in ours; that is to say, their feelings, their thoughts,
   their judgments and their efforts were bounded by the horizon and the
   framework in which their own nation was set and by its condition at the
   time. Had it been otherwise, they would not have been men of flesh and
   blood, but spectral beings. For seventeen hundred years, indeed, people
   thought, and many among us still think, that the "humanity" of Jesus
   Christ, which is a part of their creed, is sufficiently provided for by
   the assumption that he had a human body and a human soul. As if it were
   possible to have that without having any definite character as an
   individual! To be a man means, in the first place, to possess a certain
   mental and spiritual disposition, determined in such and such a way,
   and thereby limited and circumscribed; and, in the second place, it
   means to be situated, with this disposition, in an historical
   environment which in its turn is also limited and circumscribed.
   Outside this there are no such things as "men." It at once follows,
   however, that a man can think, speak, and do absolutely nothing at all
   in which his peculiar disposition and his own age are not coefficients.
   A single word may seem to be really classical and valid for all time,
   and yet the very language in which it is spoken gives it very palpable
   limitations. Much less is a spiritual personality, as a whole,
   susceptible of being represented in a way that will banish the feeling
   of its limitations, and with those limitations, the sense of something
   strange or conventional; and this feeling must necessarily be enhanced
   the farther in point of time the spectator is removed.

   From these circumstances it follows that the historian, whose business
   and highest duty it is to determine what is of permanent value, is of
   necessity required not to cleave to words but to find out what is
   essential. The "whole" Christ, the "whole" Gospel, if we mean by this
   motto the external image taken in all its details and set up for
   imitation, is just as bad and deceptive a shibboleth as the "whole"
   Luther, and the like. It is bad because it enslaves us, and it is
   deceptive because the people who proclaim it do not think of taking it.
   seriously, and could not do so if they tried. They cannot do so because
   they cannot cease to feel, understand and judge as children of their
   age.

   There are only two possibilities here: either the Gospel is in all
   respects identical with its earliest form, in which case it came with
   its time and has departed with it; or else it contains something which,
   under differing historical forms, is of permanent validity. The latter
   is the true view. The history of the Church shows us in its very
   commencement that "primitive Christianity" had to disappear in order
   that "Christianity" might remain; and in the same way in later ages one
   metamorphosis followed upon another. From the beginning it was a
   question of getting rid of formulas, correcting expectations, altering
   ways of feeling, and this is a process to which there is no end. But by
   the very fact that our survey embraces the whole course as well as the
   inception we enhance our standard of what is essential and of real
   value.

   We enhance our standard, but we need not wait to take it from the
   history of those later ages. The thing itself reveals it. We shall see
   that the Gospel in the Gospel is something so simple, something that
   speaks to us with so much power, that it cannot easily be mistaken. No
   far-reaching directions as to method, no general introductions, are
   necessary to enable us to find the way to it. No one who possesses a
   fresh eye for what is alive, and a true feeling for what is really
   great, can fail to see it and distinguish it from its contemporary
   integument. And even though there may be many individual aspects of it
   where the task of distinguishing what is permanent from what is
   fleeting, what is rudimentary from what is merely historical, is not
   quite easy, we must not be like the child who, wanting to get at the
   kernel of a bulb, went on picking off the leaves until there was
   nothing left, and then could not help seeing that it was just the
   leaves that made the bulb. Endeavours of this kind are not unknown in
   the history of the Christian religion, but they fade before those other
   endeavours which seek to convince us that there is no such thing as
   either kernel or husk, growth or decay, but that everything is of equal
   value and alike permanent.

   In these lectures, then, we shall deal first of all with the Gospel of
   Jesus Christ, and this theme will occupy the greater part of our
   attention. We shall then show what impression he himself and his Gospel
   made upon the first generation of his disciples. Finally, we shall
   follow the leading changes which the Christian idea has undergone in
   the course of history, and try to recognise its chief types. What is
   common to all the forms which it has taken, corrected by reference to
   the Gospel, and, conversely, the chief features of the Gospel,
   corrected by reference to history, will, we may be allowed to hope,
   bring us to the kernel of the matter. Within the limits of a short
   series of lectures it is, of course, only to what is important that
   attention can be called; but perhaps there will be no disadvantage in
   fixing our attention, for once, only on the strong lines and prominent
   points of the relief, and, by putting what is secondary into the
   background, in looking at the vast material in a concentrated form. We
   shall even refrain, and permissibly refrain, from enlarging, by way of
   introduction, on Judaism and its external and internal relations, and
   on the Graeco-Roman world. We must never, of course, wholly shut our
   eyes to them nay, we must always keep them in mind; but diffuse
   explanations in regard to these matters are unnecessary. Jesus Christ's
   teaching will at once bring us by steps which, if few, will be great,
   to a height where its connexion with Judaism is seen to be only a loose
   one, and most of the threads leading from it into "contemporary
   history" become of no importance at all. This may seem a paradoxical
   thing to say; for just now we are being earnestly assured, with an air
   as though it were some new discovery that was being imparted to us,
   that Jesus Christ's teaching cannot be understood, nay, cannot be
   accurately represented, except by having regard to its connexion with
   the Jewish doctrines prevalent at the time, and by first of all setting
   them out in full. There is much that is true in this statement, and
   yet, as we shall see, it is incorrect. It becomes absolutely false,
   however, when worked up into the dazzling thesis that the Gospel is
   intelligible only as the religion of a despairing section of the Jewish
   nation; that it was the last effort of a decadent age, driven by
   distress into a renunciation of this earth, and then trying to storm
   heaven and demanding civic rights there--a religion of miserabilism! It
   is rather remarkable that the really desperate were just those who did
   not welcome it, but fought against it; remarkable that its leaders, so
   far as we know them, do not, in fact, bear any of the marks of sickly
   despair; most remarkable of all, that while indeed renouncing the world
   and its goods, they establish, in love and holiness, a brotherly union
   which declares war on the world's misery. The oftener I re-read and
   consider the Gospels, the more do I find that the contemporary
   discords, in the midst of which the Gospel stood, and out of which it
   arose, sink into the background. I entertain no doubt that the founder
   had his eye upon man in whatever external situation he might be
   found--upon man who, fundamentally, always remains the same, whether he
   be moving upwards or downwards, whether he be in riches or poverty,
   whether he be of strong mind or of weak. It is the consciousness of all
   these oppositions being ultimately beneath it, and of its own place
   above them, that gives the Gospel its sovereignty; for in every man it
   looks to the point that is unaffected by all these differences. This is
   very clear in Paul's case; he dominates all earthly things and
   circumstances like a king, and desires to see them so dominated. The
   thesis of the decadent age and the religion of the wretched may serve
   to lead us into the outer court; it may even correctly point to that
   which originally gave the Gospel its form; but if it is offered us as a
   key for the understanding of this religion in itself, we must reject
   it. Moreover, this thesis and the pretensions which it makes are only
   illustrations of a fashion which has become general in the writing of
   history, and which in that province will naturally have a longer reign
   than other fashions, because by its means much that was obscure has, as
   a matter of fact, been cleared up. But to the heart of the matter its
   devotees do not penetrate, as they silently assume that no such heart
   exists.

   Let me conclude this lecture by touching briefly on one other important
   point. In history absolute judgments are impossible. This is a truth
   which in these days--I say advisedly, in these days--is clear and
   incontestable. History can only show how things have been; and even
   where we can throw light upon the past, and understand and criticise
   it, we must not presume to think that by any process of abstraction
   absolute judgments as to the value to be assigned to past events can be
   obtained from the results of a purely historical survey. Such judgments
   are the creation only of feeling and of will; they are a subjective
   act. The false notion that the understanding can produce them is a
   heritage of that protracted epoch in which knowing and knowledge were
   expected to accomplish everything; in which it was believed that they
   could be stretched so as to be capable of covering and satisfying all
   the needs of the mind and the heart. That they cannot do. This is a
   truth which, in many an hour of ardent work, falls heavily upon our
   soul, and yet--what a hopeless thing it would be for mankind if the
   higher peace to which it aspires, and the clearness, the certainty and
   the strength for which it strives, were dependent on the measure of its
   learning and its knowledge.

LECTURE II

   OUR first section deals with the main features of the message delivered
   by Jesus Christ. They include the form in which he delivered what he
   had to say. We shall see how essential a part of his character is here
   exhibited, for "he spoke as one having authority and not as the
   Scribes." But before describing these features I feel it my duty to
   tell you briefly how matters stand in regard to the sources of our
   knowledge.

   Our authorities for the message which Jesus Christ delivered are--apart
   from certain important statements made by Paul--the first three
   Gospels. Everything that we know, independently of these Gospels, about
   Jesus' history and his teaching, may be easily put on a small sheet of
   paper, so little does it come to. In particular, the fourth Gospel,
   which does not emanate or profess to emanate from the apostle John,
   cannot be taken as an historical authority in the ordinary meaning of
   the word. The author of it acted with sovereign freedom, transposed
   events and put them in a strange light, drew up the discourses himself,
   and illustrated great thoughts by imaginary situations. Although,
   therefore, his work is not altogether devoid of a real, if scarcely
   recognisable, traditional element, it can hardly make any claim to be
   considered an authority for Jesus' history; only little of what he says
   can be accepted, and that little with caution. On the other hand, it is
   an authority of the first rank for answering the question, What vivid
   views of Jesus' person, what kind of light and warmth, did the Gospel
   disengage?

   Sixty years ago David Friedrich Strauss thought that he had almost
   entirely destroyed the historical credibility not only of the fourth
   but also of the first three Gospels as well. The historical criticism
   of two generations has succeeded in restoring that credibility in its
   main outlines. These Gospels are not, it is true, historical works any
   more than the fourth; they were not written with the simple object of
   giving the facts as they were; they are books composed for the work of
   evangelisation. Their purpose is to awaken a belief in Jesus Christ's
   person and mission; and the purpose is served by the description of his
   deeds and discourses, as well as by the references to the Old
   Testament. Nevertheless they are not altogether useless as sources of
   history, more especially as the object with which they were written is
   not supplied from without, but coincides in part with what Jesus
   intended. But such other great leading purposes as have been ascribed
   to the evangelists have been one and all shown to lack any foundation,
   although with each individual evangelist many secondary purposes may
   have come into play. The Gospels are not "party tracts" neither are
   they writings which as yet bear the radical impress of the Greek
   spirit. In their essential substance they belong to the first, the
   Jewish, epoch of Christianity, that brief epoch which may be denoted as
   the palaeontological. That we possess any reports dating from that
   time, even though, as is obvious in the first and third Gospel, the
   setting and the composition are by another hand, is one of those
   historical arrangements for which we cannot be too thankful. Criticism
   to-day universally recognises the unique character of the Gospels. What
   especially marks them off from all subsequent literature is the way in
   which they state their facts. This species of literary art, which took
   shape partly by analogy with the didactic narratives of the Jews, and
   partly from catechetical necessities--this simple and impressive form
   of exposition was, even a few decades later, no longer capable of exact
   reproduction. From the time that the Gospel was transferred to the
   broad ground of the Graeco-Roman world it appropriated the literary
   forms of the Greeks, and the style of the evangelists was then felt to
   be something strange but sublime. When all is said, the Greek language
   lies upon these writings only like a diaphanous veil, and it requires
   hardly any effort to retranslate their contents into Hebrew or Aramaic.
   That the tradition here presented to us is, in the main, at first hand
   is obvious.

   How fixed this tradition was in regard to its form is proved by the
   third Gospel. It was composed by a Greek, probably in the time of
   Domitian; and in the second part of his work, the Acts of the
   Apostles--besides the preface to the first--he shows us that he was
   familiar with the literary language of his nation and that he was an
   excellent master of style. But in the Gospel narrative he did not dare
   to abandon the traditional type: he tells his story in the same style
   as Mark and Matthew, with the same connexion of sentences, the same
   colour, nay, with many of precisely the same details; it is only the
   ruder words and expressions, which would offend literary taste, that
   are sparingly corrected. There is another respect, too, in which his
   Gospel strikes us as remarkable: he assures us at the beginning of it
   that he has "had perfect understanding of all things from the very
   first," and has examined many accounts. But if we test him by his
   authorities, we find that he has kept in the main to Mark's Gospel, and
   to a source which we also find appearing again in Matthew. These
   accounts both seemed to him, as a respectable chronicler, to be
   preferable to the crowd of others. That offers a good guarantee for
   them. No historian has found that it is possible or necessary to
   substitute any other tradition for the one which we have here.

   Another point: this tradition is, apart from the story of the Passion,
   almost exclusively Galilean in its character. Had not the history of
   Jesus' public activity been really bounded by this geographical
   horizon, tradition could not have so described it; for every historical
   narrative with an eye to effect would have represented him as working
   chiefly in Jerusalem. That is the account given by the fourth Gospel.
   That our first three evangelists almost entirely refrain from saying
   anything about Jerusalem arouses a good prejudice in their favour.

   It is true that, measured by the standard of "agreement, inspiration
   and completeness," these writings leave a very great deal to be
   desired, and even when judged by a more human standard they suffer from
   not a few imperfections. Rude additions from a later age they do not,
   indeed, exhibit--it will always remain a noteworthy fact that,
   conversely, it is only the fourth Gospel which makes Greeks ask after
   Jesus--but still they, too, reflect, here and there, the circumstances
   in which the primitive Christian community was placed and the
   experiences which it afterwards underwent. People nowadays, however,
   put such constructions on the text more readily than is necessary.
   Further, the conviction that Old Testament prophecy was fulfilled in
   Jesus' history had a disturbing effect on tradition. Lastly, in some of
   the narratives the miraculous element is obviously intensified. On the
   other hand, Strauss' contention that the Gospels contain a very great
   deal that is mythical has and not been borne out, even if the very
   indefinite defective conception of what "mythical" means in Strauss'
   application of the word, be allowed to pass. It is almost exclusively
   in the account of Jesus' childhood, and there only sparingly, that a
   mythical touch can be traced. None of these disturbing elements affect
   the heart of the narrative; not a few of them easily lend themselves to
   correction, partly by a comparison of the Gospels one with another,
   partly through the sound judgment that is matured by historical study.

   But the miraculous element, all these reports of miracles! Not Strauss
   only, but many others too, have allowed themselves to be frightened by
   them into roundly denying the credibility of the Gospels. But, on the
   other hand, historical science in this last generation has taken a
   great step in advance by learning to pass a more intelligent and
   benevolent judgment on those narratives, and accordingly even reports
   of the marvellous can now be counted amongst the materials of history
   and turned to good account. I owe it to you and to the subject briefly
   to specify the position which historical science today takes up in
   regard to these reports.

   In the first place, we know that the Gospels come from a time in which
   the marvellous may be said to have been something of almost daily
   occurrence. People felt and saw that they were surrounded by wonders,
   and not by any means only in the religious sphere. Certain
   spiritualists among us excepted, we are now accustomed to associate the
   question of miracles exclusively with the question of religion. In
   those days it was otherwise. The fountains of the marvellous were many.
   Some sort of divinity was, of course, supposed to be at work in every
   case; it was a god who accomplished the miracle; but it was not to
   every god that people stood in a religious relation. Further, in those
   days, the strict conception which we now attach to the word "miracle"
   was as yet unknown; it came in only with a knowledge of the laws of
   Nature and their general validity. Before that, no sound insight
   existed into what was possible and what was impossible, what was rule
   and what was exception. But where this distinction is not clear, or
   where, as the case may be, the question has not yet been raised at all
   in any rigorous form, there are no such things as miracles in the
   strict sense of the word. No one can feel anything to be an
   interruption of the order of Nature who does not yet know what the
   order of Nature is. Miracles, then, could not possess the significance
   for that age which, if they existed, they would possess for ours. For
   that age all wonders were only extraordinary events, and, even if they
   formed a world by themselves, it was certain that there were countless
   points in which that other world mysteriously encroached upon our own.
   Nor was it only God's messengers, but magicians and charlatans as well,
   who were thought to be possessed of some of these miraculous powers.
   The significance attaching to "miracles" was, therefore, in those days
   a subject of never-ending controversy; at one moment a high value was
   set upon them and they were considered to belong to the very essence of
   religion; at another, they were spoken of with contempt.

   In the second place, we now know that it . is not after they have been
   long dead, nor even after the lapse of many years, that miracles have
   been reported of eminent persons, but at once, often the very next day.
   The habit of condemning a narrative, or of ascribing it to a later age,
   only because it includes stories of miracles, is a piece of prejudice.

   In the third place, we are firmly convinced that what happens in space
   and time is subject to the general laws of motion, and that in this
   sense, as an interruption of the order of Nature, there can be no such
   things as "miracles." But we also recognise that the religious man if
   religion really permeates him and is something more than a belief in
   the religion of others--is certain that he is not shut up within a
   blind and brutal course of Nature, but that this course of Nature
   serves higher ends, or, as it may be, that some inner and divine power
   can help us so to encounter it as that "everything must necessarily be
   for the best." This experience, which I might express in one word as
   the ability to escape from the power and the service of transitory
   things, is always felt afresh to be a miracle each time that it occurs;
   it is inseparable from every, higher religion, and were it to be
   surrendered, religion would be at an end. But it is an experience which
   is equally true of the life of the individual and of the great course
   of human history. How dearly and logically, then, must a religious man
   think, if, in spite of this experience, he holds firmly to the
   inviolable character of what happens in space and time. Who can wonder
   that even great minds fail to keep the two spheres quite separate? And
   as we all live, first and foremost, in the domain not of ideas but of
   perceptions, and in a language of metaphor, how can we avoid conceiving
   that which is divine and makes us free as a mighty power working upon
   the order of Nature, and breaking through or arresting it? This notion,
   though it belong only to the realm of fantasy and metaphor, will, it
   seems, last as long as religion itself.

   In the fourth place, and lastly, although the order of Nature be
   inviolable, we are not yet by any means acquainted with all the forces
   working in it and acting reciprocally with other forces. Our
   acquaintance even with the forces inherent in matter, and with the
   field of their action, is incomplete; while of psychic forces we know
   very much less. We see that a strong will and a firm faith exert an
   influence upon the life of the body, and produce phenomena which strike
   us as marvellous. Who is there up to now that has set any sure bounds
   to the province of the possible and the actual? No one. Who can say how
   far the influence of soul upon soul and of soul upon body reaches? No
   one. Who can still maintain that any extraordinary phenomenon that may
   appear in this domain is entirely based on error and delusion?
   Miracles, it is true, do not happen; but of the marvellous and the
   inexplicable there is plenty. In our present state of knowledge we have
   become more careful, more hesitating in our judgment, in regard to the
   stories of the miraculous which we have received from antiquity. That
   the earth in its course stood still; that a she-ass spoke; that a storm
   was quieted by a word, we do not believe, and we shall never again
   believe; but that the lame walked, the blind saw, and the deaf heard
   will not lqe so summarily dismissed as an illusion.

   From these suggestions you can arrive for yourselves at the right
   position to take up in regard to the miraculous stories related in the
   Gospels, and at their net results. In particular cases, that is to say,
   in the application of general principles to concrete statements, some
   uncertainty will always remain. So far as I can judge, the stories may
   be grouped as follows:--(1) Stories which had their origin in an
   exaggerated view of natural events of an impressive character; (2)
   stories which had their origin in sayings or parables, or in the
   projection of inner experiences on to the external world; (3) stories
   such as arose in the interests of the fulfilment of Old Testament
   sayings; (4) stories of surprising cures effected by Jesus' spiritual
   force; (5) stories of which we cannot fathom the secret. It is very
   remarkable, however, that Jesus himself did not assign that critical
   importance to his miraculous deeds which even the evangelist Mark and
   the others all attributed to them. Did he not exclaim, in tones of
   complaint and accusation, "Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not
   believe!"? He who uttered these words cannot have held that belief in
   the wonders which he wrought was the right or the only avenue to the
   recognition of his person and his mission; nay, in all essential points
   he must have thought of them quite otherwise than his evangelists. And
   the remarkable fact that these very evangelists, without appreciating
   its range, hand down the statement that Jesus "did not many mighty
   works there because of their unbelief," shows us, from another and a
   different side, with what caution we must receive these miraculous
   stories, and into what category we must put them.

   It follows from all this that we must not try to evade the Gospel by
   entrenching ourselves behind the miraculous stories related by the
   evangelists. In spite of those stories, nay, in part even in them, we
   are presented with a reality which has claims upon our participation.
   Study it, and do not let yourselves be deterred because this or that
   miraculous story strikes you as strange or leaves you cold. If there is
   anything here that you find unintelligible, put it quietly aside.
   Perhaps you will have to leave it there forever; perhaps the meaning
   will dawn upon you later and the story assume a significance of which
   you never dreamt. Once more, let me say: do not be deterred. The
   question of miracles is of relative indifference in comparison with
   everything else which is to be found in the Gospels. It is not miracles
   that matter; the question on which everything, turns is whether we are
   helplessly yoked to an inexorable necessity, or whether a God exists
   who rules and governs, and whose power to compel Nature we can move by
   prayer and make a part of our experience.

   Our evangelists, as we know, do not tell us anything about the history
   of Jesus' early development; they tell us only of his public activity.
   Two of the Gospels do, it is true, contain an introductory history (the
   history of Jesus' birth); but we may disregard it; for even if it
   contained something more trustworthy than it does actually contain, it
   would be as good as useless for our purpose. That is to say, the
   evangelists themselves never refer to it, nor make Jesus himself refer
   to his antecedents. On the contrary, they tell us that Jesus' mother
   and his brethren were completely surprised at his coming forward, and
   did not know what to make of it. Paul, too, is silent; so that we can
   be sure that the oldest tradition knew nothing of any stories of Jesus'
   birth.

   We know nothing of Jesus' history for the first thirty years of his
   life. Is there not a terrible uncertainty here? What is there left us
   if we have to begin our task by confessing that we are unable to write
   any life of Jesus? How can we write the history of a man of whose
   development we know nothing, and with only a year or two of whose life
   we are acquainted? Now, however certain it may be that our materials
   are insufficient for a "biography," they are very weighty in other
   respects, and even their silence on the first thirty years is
   instructive. They are weighty because they give us information upon
   three important points: In the first place, they offer us a plain
   picture of Jesus' teaching, in regard both to its main features and to
   its individual application; in the second place, they tell us how his
   life issued in the service of his vocation; and in the third place,
   they describe to us the impression which he made upon his disciples,
   and which they transmitted.

   These are, in fact, three important points; nay, they are the points on
   which everything turns. It is because we can get a clear view of them
   that a characteristic picture of Jesus is possible; or, to speak more
   modestly, that there is some hope for an attempt to understand what his
   aims were, what he was, and what he signifies for us.

   As regards the thirty years of silence, we gather from our evangelists
   that Jesus did not think it necessary to give his disciples any
   information about them. But much may be said about them negatively.
   First of all, it is very improbable that he went through any Rabbinical
   school; he nowhere speaks like a man who had assimilated any
   theological culture of a technical kind, or learned the art of
   scholarly exegesis. Compare him in this respect with the apostle Paul;
   how clearly it can be seen from the latter's epistles that he had sat
   at the feet of theological teachers. With Jesus we find nothing of the
   kind; and hence he caused a stir by appearing in the schools and
   teaching at all. He lived and had his being in the sacred writings, but
   not after the manner of a professional teacher.

   Neither can he have had any relations with the Essenes, a remarkable
   order of Jewish monks. Were that so, he would have belonged to the
   pupils who show their dependence on their teachers by proclaiming and
   doing the opposite of what they have been taught. The Essenes made a
   point of the most extreme purity in the eye of the law, and held
   severely aloof not only from the impure but even from those who were a
   little lax in their purity. It is only thus that we can understand
   their living strictly apart, their dwelling in particular places, and
   their practice of frequent ablutions every day. Jesus exhibits a
   complete contrast with this mode of life: he goes in search of sinners
   and eats with them. So fundamental a difference alone makes it certain
   that he had nothing to do with the Essenes. His aims and the means
   which he employed divide him off from them. If he appears to coincide
   with them in many of his individual injunctions to his disciples, these
   are accidental points of contact, as his motives were quite other than
   theirs.

   Further, unless all appearances are deceptive, no stormy crisis, no
   breach with his past, lies behind the period of Jesus' life that we
   know. In none of his sayings or discourses, whether he is threatening
   and punishing or drawing and calling people to him with kindness,
   whether he is speaking of his relation to the Father or to the world,
   can we discover the signs of inner revolutions overcome, or the scars
   of any terrible conflict. Everything seems to pour from him naturally,
   as though it could not do otherwise, like a spring from the depths of
   the earth, clear and unchecked in its flow. Where shall we find the man
   who at the age of thirty can so speak, if he has gone through bitter
   struggles--struggles of the soul, in which he has ended by burning what
   he once adored, and by adoring what he burned? Where shall we find the
   man who has broken with his past, in order to summon others to
   repentance as well as himself, but who through it all never speaks of
   his own repentance? This consideration makes it impossible that his
   life could have been spent in inner conflict, however little it may
   have been lacking in deep emotion, in temptation and in doubt.

   One final point: the picture of Jesus' life and his discourses stand in
   no relation with the Greek spirit. That is almost a matter for
   surprise; for Galilee was full of Greeks, and Greek was then spoken in
   many of its cities, much as Swedish is nowadays in Finland. There were
   Greek teachers and philosophers there, and it is scarcely conceivable
   that Jesus should have been entirely unacquainted with their language.
   But that he was in any way influenced by them, that he was ever in
   touch with the thoughts of Plato or the Porch, even though it may have
   been only in some popular redaction, it is absolutely impossible to
   maintain. Of course if religious individualism--God and the soul, the
   soul and its God; if subjectivism; if the full self-responsibility of
   the individual; if the separation of the religious from the
   political--if all this is only Greek, then Jesus, too, stands within
   the sphere of Greek development; then he, too, breathed the pure air of
   Greece and drank from the Greek spring. But it cannot be proved that it
   is only on this one line, only in the Hellenic people, that this
   development took place; nay, it is rather the contrary that can be
   shown; other nations also advanced to similar states of knowledge and
   feeling; although they did so, it is true, as a rule, only after
   Alexander the Great had pulled down the barriers and fences which
   separated the peoples. For these nations, too, no doubt it was in the
   majority of cases the Greek element that was the liberating and
   progressive factor. But I do not believe that the Psalmist who uttered
   the words, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
   earth that I desire beside thee," had ever heard anything of Socrates
   or of Plato.

   Enough: from their silence on the first thirty years of Jesus' life,
   and from what the evangelists do not tell us of the period of his
   activity, there are important things to be learnt.

   He lived in religion, and it was breath to him in the fear of God; his
   whole life, all his thoughts and feelings, were absorbed in the
   relation to God, and yet he did not talk like an enthusiast and a
   fanatic, who sees only one red-hot spot, and so is blind to the world
   and all that it contains. He spoke his message and looked at the world
   with a fresh and clear eye for the life, great and small, that
   surrounded him. He proclaimed that to gain the whole world was nothing
   if the soul were injured, and yet he remained kind and sympathetic to
   every living thing. That is the most astonishing and the greatest fact
   about him! His discourses, generally in the form of parables and
   sayings, exhibit every degree of human speech and the whole range of
   the emotions. The sternest tones of passionate accusation and indignant
   reproof, nay, even irony, he does not despise; but they must have
   formed the exception with him. He is possessed of a quiet, uniform,
   collected demeanour, with everything directed to one goal. He never
   uses any ecstatic language, and the tone of stirring prophecy is rare.
   Entrusted with the greatest of all missions, his eye and ear are open
   to every impression of the life around him--a proof of intense calm and
   absolute certainty.

   Mourning and weeping, laughing and dancing, wealth and poverty, hunger
   and thirst, health and sickness, children's play and politics,
   gathering and scattering, the leaving of home, life in the inn and the
   return, marriage and funeral, the splendid house of the living and the
   grave of the dead, the sower and the reaper in the field, the lord of
   the vintage among his vines, the idle workman in the marketplace, the
   shepherd searching for the sheep, the dealer in pearls on the sea, and,
   then again, the woman at home anxious over the barrel of meal and the
   leaven, or the lost piece of money, the widow's complaint to the surly
   official, the earthly food that perishes, the mental relation of
   teacher and pupil, on the one side regal glory and the tyrant's lust of
   power, on the other childish innocence and the industry of the
   servant--all these pictures enliven his discourse and make it clear
   even to those who are children in mind.

   They do more than tell us that he spoke in picture and parable. They
   exhibit an inner freedom and a cheerfulness of soul in the midst of the
   greatest strain, such as no prophet ever possessed before him. His eye
   rests kindly upon the flowers and the children, on the lily of the
   field--"Solomon in all his glory is not clothed like one of them"--on
   the birds in the air and the sparrows on the house-top. The sphere in
   which he lived, above the earth and its concerns, did not destroy his
   interest in it; no! he brought everything in it into relation with the
   God whom he knew, and he saw it as protected in Him: "Your Father in
   heaven feeds them." The parable is his most familiar form of speech.
   Insensibly, however, parable and sympathy pass into each other. Yet he
   who had not where to lay his head does not speak like one who has
   broken with everything, or like an heroic penitent, or like an ecstatic
   prophet, but like a man who has rest and peace for his soul, and is
   able to give life and strength to others. He strikes the mightiest
   notes; he offers men an inexorable alternative; he leaves them no
   escape; and yet the strongest emotion seems to come naturally to him,
   and he expresses it as something natural; he clothes it in the language
   in which a mother speaks to her child.

LECTURE III

   IN the previous lecture we spoke of our evangelists and of their
   silence on the subject of Jesus' early development. We described in
   brief the mode and character of his teaching. We saw that he spoke like
   a prophet, and yet not like a prophet. His words breathe peace, joy and
   certainty. He urges the necessity of struggle and decision--"where your
   treasure is, there will your heart be also"--and yet the quiet symmetry
   of a parable is over all that he says: under God's sun and the dew of
   heaven everything is to grow and increase until the harvest. He lived
   in the continual consciousness of God's presence. His food and drink
   was to do God's will. But--and this seemed to us the greatest thing
   about him and the seal of his inner freedom--he did not speak like an
   heroic penitent, or like an ascetic who has turned his back upon the
   world. His eye rested kindly upon the whole world, and he saw it as it
   was, in all its varied and changing colours. He ennobled it in his
   parables; his gaze penetrated the veil of the earthly, and he
   recognised everywhere the hand of the living God.

   When he came forward, another was already at work among the Jewish
   people: John the Baptist. Within a few months a great movement had
   arisen on the banks of the Jordan. It differed altogether from those
   messianic movements which for several generations had by fits and
   starts kept the nation alive. The Baptist, it is true, also proclaimed
   that the kingdom of God was at hand; and that meant nothing less than
   that the day of the Lord, the judgment, the end, was then coming. But
   the day of judgment which John the Baptist announced was not the day
   when God was going to take vengeance upon the heathen and raise up His
   own people; it was the day of judgment for this very people that he
   prophesied. "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Think
   not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say
   unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
   Abraham. And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees." In
   that day of judgment it is not being children of Abraham, but doing
   works of righteousness, which is to turn the scale. And he, the
   preacher, himself began with repentance and devoted his life to it; he
   stands before them in raiment of camel's hair, and his meat is locusts
   and wild honey. But it is not in the levying of a band of ascetics that
   he sees his work, or at any rate his main work. He appeals to the whole
   nation, busy with its various trades and callings, and summons it to
   repentance. They seem very simple truths that he utters: to the
   publicans he says: "Exact no more than that which is appointed you"; to
   the soldiers: "Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and
   be content with your wages"; to the well-to-do: "He that hath two
   coats, let him impart to him that hath none, and he that hath meat, let
   him do likewise"; and to all: "Forget not the poor." This is the
   practical proof of the repentance to which he calls, and it embraces
   the conversion which he has in view. It is not a question of a single
   act, the baptism of repentance, but of a righteous life in the face of
   the avenging justice of God. Of ceremonies, sacrifices, and the works
   of the law, John did not speak; apparently he thought them unimportant.
   It was on a right disposition and good deeds that everything turned. In
   the day of judgment it was by this standard that the God of Abraham
   would judge.

   Let us pause here for a moment. Questions force themselves upon us at
   this point which have often been answered and still are again and again
   put. It is clear that John the Baptist proclaimed the sovereignty of
   God and His holy moral law. It is also clear that he proclaimed to his
   fellow-countrymen that it was by the moral law that they were to
   measure, and that on this alone everything was to turn. He told them
   that what they were to care about most was to be in a right state
   within and to do good deeds. It is clear, lastly, that there is nothing
   over-refined or artificial in his notion of what was good; he means
   ordinary morality. It is here that the questions arise.

   Firstly: if it was only so simple a matter as the eternal claims of
   what is right and holy, why all this apparatus about the coming of the
   day of judgment, about the axe being laid to the root of the trees,
   about the unquenchable fire, and so on?

   Secondly: is not this baptism in the wilderness and this proclamation
   that the day of judgment was at hand simply the reflection or the
   product of the political and social state of the nation at the time?

   Thirdly: what is there that is really new in this proclamation and had
   not been already expressed in Judaism?

   These three questions are very intimately connected with one another.

   Firstly, then, as to the whole dramatic eschatological apparatus about
   the coming of the kingdom of God, the end being at hand, and so on.
   Well, every time that a man earnestly, and out of the depths of his own
   personal experience, points others to God and to what is good and holy,
   whether it be deliverance or judgment that he preaches, it has always,
   so far as history tells us, taken the form of announcing that the end
   is at hand. How is that to be explained? The answer is not difficult.
   Not only is religion a life in and with God; but, just because it is
   that, it is also the revelation of the meaning and responsibility of
   life. Everyone who has awakened to a sense of religion perceives that,
   without it, the search for such meaning is in vain, and that the
   individual, as well as the multitude, wanders aimlessly and falls:
   "they go astray; everyone turns to his own way." But the prophet who
   has become conscious of God is filled with terror and agony as he
   recognises that all mankind is sunk in error and indifference. He feels
   like a traveller who sees his companions blindly rushing to the edge of
   a precipice. He wants to call them back at all costs. The time is
   running out; he can still warn them; he can still adjure them to turn
   back; in a single hour, perhaps, all will be lost. The time is running
   out, it is the last moment--this is the cry in which, then, in all
   nations and at all times, any energetic call to conversion has been
   voiced whenever a fresh prophet has been granted them. The prophet's
   gaze penetrates the course of history; he sees the irrevocable end; and
   he is filled with boundless astonishment that the godlessness and
   blindness, the frivolity and indolence, have not long since brought
   everything to utter ruin and destruction. That there is still a brief
   moment left in which conversion is possible seems to him the greatest
   marvel of all, and to be ascribed only to God's forbearance. But
   certain it is that the end cannot be very far off. This is the way in
   which with every great cry for repentance the idea of the approaching
   end always arises. The individual forms in which it shapes itself
   depend upon con temporary circumstances and are of subordinate
   importance. It is only the religion which has beer built up into an
   intellectual system that does not make this emphasising of the end
   all-important without such emphasis no actual religion is conceivable,
   whether it springs up anew like a sudden flame or glows in the soul
   like a secret fire.

   I pass now to the second question: whether the social and political
   conditions of the time were not causes of the religious movement. Let
   us sec briefly where we are. You are aware that at thf time of which we
   speak the peaceful days of the Jewish theocracy were long past. For two
   centuries blow had followed upon blow; from the terrible days of
   Antiochus Epiphanes onwards the nation had never had any rest. The
   kingdom of the Maccabees had been set up, and through inner strife and
   external foe had soon disappeared again, The Romans had invaded the
   country and had laid their iron hand upon everything. The tyranny of
   that Edomite parvenu, King Herod, had robbed the nation of every
   pleasure in life and maimed it in all its members. So far as human
   foresight went, it looked as if no improvement in its position could
   ever again be effected; the lie seemed to be given to all the glorious
   old prophecies; the end appeared to have come. How easy it was at such
   an epoch to despair of all earthly things, and in this despair to
   renounce in utter distress what had once passed as the inseparable
   accompaniment of the theocracy. How easy it was now to declare the
   earthly crown, political possessions, prestige and wealth, strenuous
   effort and struggle, to be one and all worthless, and in place of them
   to look to heaven for a completely new kingdom, a kingdom for the poor,
   the oppressed, the weak, and. to hope that their virtues of gentleness
   and patience would receive a crown. And if for hundreds of years the
   national God of Israel had been undergoing a transformation; if He had
   broken in pieces the weapons of the mighty, and derided the showy
   worship of His priests; if He had demanded righteous judgment and
   mercy--what a temptation there was to proclaim Him as the God who wills
   to see His people in misery that He may then bring them deliverance! We
   can, in fact, with a few touches construct the religion and its hopes
   which seemed of necessity to result from the circumstances of the time
   --a miserabilism which clings to the expectation of a miraculous
   interference on God's part, and in the meantime, as it were, wallows in
   wretchedness.

   But although the terrible circumstances of the time certainly
   disengaged and developed many ideas of this kind, and easily account
   for the wild enterprises of the false Messiahs and the political
   efforts of fanatical Pharisees, they are very far from being sufficient
   to explain John the Baptist's message. They do, indeed, explain how it
   was that deliverance from earthly things was an idea which seized hold
   of wide circles, and that people were looking to God. Trouble makes men
   pray. But trouble in itself does not give any moral force, and moral
   force was the chief element in John the Baptist's message. In appealing
   to it, in proclaiming that everything must be based on morality and
   personal responsibility, he took a higher point of view than the feeble
   piety of the "poor," and drew not from time but from eternity.

   It is scarcely a century since Fichte delivered his memorable orations
   here in Berlin, after the terrible defeat which Germany had suffered.
   What did he do in these lectures? In the first place, he held up a
   mirror to the nation, and showed it its sins and their
   consequences,--frivolity, godlessness, self-complacency, infatuation,
   weakness. What did he do next? Did he simply call them to arms? Arms
   were just what they were no longer capable of hearing; they had been
   struck from their powerless hands. It was to repentance and to inward
   conversion that he called them; to God, and therefore to the exertion
   of all their moral force; to truth and to the Spirit, so that by the
   Spirit everything might be made new. By his powerful personality, and
   in union with friends of a like mind, he produced an immense
   impression. He succeeded in opening up once more the choked fountains
   of our energy, because he knew the strength from which help comes and
   had drunk of the living water himself. No doubt the necessities of the
   time taught him and steeled him; but it would be foolish and ridiculous
   to maintain that Fichte's orations were the product of the general woe.
   They are the antithesis of it. Not otherwise must we think of John the
   Baptist's message, and--let me say it at once--of the message which
   Jesus himself delivered. That they appealed to those who expected
   nothing of the world or of politics--of John the Baptist, however, this
   is not directly reported; that they would have nothing to do with those
   popular leaders who had led the people to ruin; that they turned their
   gaze altogether from earthly things, may also be accounted for by the
   circumstances of the time. But the remedy which they proclaimed was no
   product of those circumstances. Nay, was not calling people to ordinary
   morality expecting everything of it bound to seem a hopeless
   enterprise? And whence came the power, the inflexible power, which
   compelled others? This leads us to the last of the questions which we
   have raised.

   Thirdly, what was there that was new in the whole movement? Was it
   anything new to set up the sovereignty of God, the sovereignty of the
   good and the holy, in opposition to all the other elements which had
   forced their way into religion? Did John the Baptist, did Christ
   himself, bring in anything that had not been proclaimed long before?
   Gentlemen, the question as to what is new in religion is not a question
   which is raised by those who live in it. What is there that can have
   been "new," seeing that mankind existed so long before Jesus Christ and
   had seen so much in the way of intelligence and knowledge? Monotheism
   had long been introduced, and the few possible types of monotheistic
   religious fervour had long made their appearance here and there, and
   had taken possession of whole schools, nay, of a whole nation. Can the
   religious individualism of that Psalmist ever be surpassed in depth and
   vigour who confessed: "Lord, when I have thee, I ask not after heaven
   and earth"? Can we go beyond what Micah said: "He hath showed thee, O
   man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do
   justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God"? Centuries
   had passed since these words were spoken. "What do you want with your
   Christ?" we are asked, principally by Jewish scholars; "he introduced
   nothing new." I answer with Wellhausen: It is quite true that what
   Jesus proclaimed, what John the Baptist expressed before him in his
   exhortations to repentance, was also to be found in the prophets, and
   even in the Jewish tradition of their time. The Pharisees themselves
   were in possession of it; but unfortunately they were in possession of
   much else besides. With them it was weighted, darkened, distorted,
   rendered ineffective and deprived of its force, by a thousand things
   which they also held to be religious and every whit as important as
   mercy and judgment. They reduced everything to one dead level, wove
   everything into one fabric; the good and holy was only one woof in a
   broad earthly warp. You ask again, then: "What was there that was new?"
   The question is out of place in monotheistic religion. Ask rather: "Had
   what was here proclaimed any strength and any vigour?" I answer: Take
   the people of Israel and search the whole history of their religion;
   take history generally, and where will you find any message about God
   and the good that was ever so pure and so full of strength--for purity
   and strength go together--as we hear and read of in the Gospels? As
   regards purity, the spring of holiness had, indeed, long been opened;
   but it was choked with sand and dirt, and its water was polluted. For
   rabbis and theologians to come afterwards and distil this water, even
   if they were successful, makes no difference. But now the spring burst
   forth afresh, and broke a new way for itself through the
   rubbish--through the rubbish which priests and theologians had heaped
   up so as to smother the true element in religion; for how often does it
   happen in history that theology is only the instrument by which
   religion is discarded! The other element was that of strength.
   Pharisaical teachers had proclaimed that everything was contained in
   the injunction to love God and one's neighbour. They spoke excellently;
   the words might have come out of Jesus' mouth. But what was the result
   of their language? That the nation, that in particular their own
   pupils, condemned the man who took the words seriously. All that they
   did was weak and, because weak, harmful. Words effect nothing; it is
   the power of the personality that stands behind them. But he "taught as
   one having authority and not as the Scribes." Such was the impression
   of him which his disciples received. His words became to them "the
   words of life," seeds which sprang up and bore fruit. That was what was
   new.

   Some such message John the Baptist had already begun to deliver. He,
   too, had undoubtedly placed himself in opposition to the leaders of the
   people; for any man who tells people to "reform," and at the same time
   enjoins nothing more than repentance and good works, always comes into
   opposition with the official leaders of religion and church. But beyond
   the lines of the message of repentance John did not go.

   Jesus Christ then appeared. He first of all accepted and affirmed the
   Baptist's message to its full extent, and he acknowledged the Baptist
   himself; nay, there was no one of whom he spoke in language of such
   warm recognition. Did not he say that among them that were born of
   women there had not arisen a greater than John the Baptist? Again and
   again he acknowledged that his cause began with the Baptist and that he
   was his forerunner. Nay, he had himself been baptised by him, and
   thereby put himself into the movement which the Baptist began.

   But he did not rest there. When he appeared, he, too, it is true, like
   John proclaimed: "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand"; but his
   message became one of joy as he delivered it. The traditions about him
   contain nothing more certain than that his message was an "evangel,"
   and that it was felt to bring blessing and joy. With good reason,
   therefore, the evangelist Luke began his narrative of Jesus' public
   appearance with the words of the prophet Isaiah:--"The Spirit of the
   Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
   the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
   deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to
   set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of
   the Lord." Or in Jesus' own words: "Come unto me all ye that labour and
   are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and
   learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart; and ye shall find rest
   unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." These
   words dominated Jesus' whole work and message; they contain the theme
   of all that he taught and did. They make it at once obvious that in
   this teaching of his he left John the Baptist's message far behind. The
   latter, although already in silent conflict with the priests and the
   scribes, did not become a definite signal for contradiction. "The
   falling and the rising again," a new humanity opposed to the old, men
   of God these Jesus Christ was the first to create. He came into
   immediate opposition with the official leaders of the people, and in
   them with ordinary human nature in general. They thought of God as of a
   despot guarding the ceremonial observances in His household; he
   breathed in the presence of God. They saw Him only in His law, which
   they had converted into a labyrinth of dark defiles, blind alleys, and
   secret passages; he saw and felt Him everywhere. They were in
   possession of a thousand of His commandments, and thought, therefore,
   that they knew Him; he had one only, and knew Him by it. They had made
   this religion into an earthly trade, and there was nothing more
   detestable; he proclaimed the living God and the soul's nobility.

   If, however we take a general view of Jesus' teaching, we shall see
   that it may be grouped under three heads. They are each of such a
   nature as to contain the whole, and hence it can be exhibited in its
   entirety under any one of them.

   Firstly, the kingdom of God and its coming.

   Secondly, God the Father and the infinite value of the human soul.

   Thirdly, the higher righteousness and the commandment of love.

   That Jesus' message is so great and so powerful lies in the fact that
   it is so simple and on the other hand so rich; so simple as to be
   exhausted in each of the leading thoughts which he uttered; so rich
   that every one of these thoughts seems to be inexhaustible and the full
   meaning of the sayings and parables beyond our reach. But more than
   that--he himself stands behind everything that he said. His words speak
   to us across the centuries with the freshness of the present. It is
   here that that profound saying is truly verified: "Speak, that I may
   see thee."

   Our course in what follows will be to try to learn what those three
   heads are, and to classify the thoughts which come under them. They
   contain the main features of Jesus' message. We shall then try to
   understand the Gospel in its relations to certain great questions of
   life.

   I.-- The kingdom of God and its coming.

   Jesus' message of the kingdom of God runs through all the forms and
   statements of the prophecy which, taking its colour from the Old
   Testament, announces the day of judgment and the visible government of
   God in the future, up to the idea of an inward coming of the kingdom,
   starting with Jesus' message and then beginning. His message embraces
   these two poles, with many stages between them that shade off one into
   another. At the one pole the coming of the kingdom seems to be a purely
   future event, and the kingdom itself to be the external rule of God; at
   the other, it appears as something inward, something which is already
   present and making its entrance at the moment. You see, therefore, that
   neither the conception of the kingdom of God, nor the way in which its
   coming is represented, is free from ambiguity. Jesus took it from the
   religious traditions of his nation, where it already occupied a
   foremost place; he accepted various aspects of it in which the
   conception was still a living force, and he added new ones.
   Eudemonistic expectations of a mundane and political character were all
   that he discarded.

   Jesus, like all those of his own nation who were really in earnest, was
   profoundly conscious of thee great antithesis between the kingdom of
   God and that kingdom of the world in which he saw the reign of evil and
   the evil one. This was no mere image or empty idea; it was a truth
   which he saw and felt most vividly. He was certain, then, that the
   kingdom of the world must perish and be destroyed. But nothing short of
   a battle can effect it. With dramatic intensity battle and victory
   stand like a picture before his soul, drawn in those large firm lines
   in which the prophets had seen them. At the close of the drama he sees
   himself seated at the right hand of his Father, and his twelve
   disciples on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel; so objective
   was this picture to him, so completely in harmony with the ideas of his
   time. Now we may take the view--and not a few of us take it--that in
   these dramatic pictures, with their hard colours and contrasts, we have
   the actual purport of Jesus' message and the fundamental form which it
   took; and that all his other statements of it must be simply regarded
   as secondary. We may say that they are all variations of it more or
   less edifying, variations which were added, perhaps, only by later
   reporters; but that the only positive factor is the dramatic hope for
   the future. In this view I cannot concur. It is considered a perverse
   procedure in similar cases to judge eminent, epoch-making personalities
   first and foremost by what they share with their contemporaries, and on
   the other hand to put what is great and characteristic in them into the
   background. The tendency as far as possible to reduce everything to one
   level, and to efface what is special and individual, may spring in some
   minds from a praiseworthy sense of truth, but it has proved misleading.
   More frequently, however, we get the endeavour, conscious or
   unconscious, to refuse greatness any recognition at all, and to throw
   down anything that is exalted. There can be no doubt about the fact
   that the idea of the two kingdoms, of God and of the devil, and their
   conflicts, and of that last conflict at some future time when the
   devil, long since cast out of heaven, will be also defeated on earth,
   was an idea which Jesus simply shared with his contemporaries. He did
   not start it, but he grew up in it and he retained it. The other view,
   however, that the kingdom of God "cometh not with observation," that it
   is already here, was his own.

   For us, gentlemen, to-day, it is difficult to reconcile, nay, it is
   scarcely possible to bridge over, such an opposition as is involved, on
   the one side in a dramatic picture of God's kingdom existing in the
   future, and on the other in the announcement that "it is in the midst
   of you," a still and mighty power in the hearts of men. But to
   understand why it was that with other historical traditions and other
   forms of culture no opposition was felt to exist between these views,
   nay, that both were able to exist side by side, we must reflect, we
   must steep ourselves in the history of the past. I imagine that a few
   hundred years hence there will be found to exist in the intellectual
   ideas which we shall have left behind us much that is contradictory;
   people will wonder how we put up with it. They will find much hard and
   dry husk in what we took for the kernel; they will be unable to
   understand how we could be so short-sighted, and fail to get a sound
   grasp of what was essential and separate it from the rest. Some day the
   knife will be applied and pieces will be cut away where as yet we do
   not feel the slightest inclination to distinguish. Let us hope that
   then we may find fair judges, who will measure our ideas not by what we
   have unwittingly taken over from tradition and are neither able nor
   called upon to correct, but by what was born of our very own, by the
   changes and improvements which we have effected in what was handed down
   to us or was commonly prevalent in our day.

   Truly the historian's task of distinguishing between what is
   traditional and what is peculiar, between kernel and husk, in Jesus
   message of the kingdom of God is a difficult and responsible one. How
   far may we go? We do not want to rob this message of its innate
   character and colour; we do not want to change it into a pale scheme of
   ethics. On the other hand, we do not want to lose sight of its peculiar
   character and strength, as we should do were we to side with those who
   resolve it into the general ideas prevailing at the time. The very way
   in which Jesus distinguished between the traditional elements--he left
   out none in which there was a spark of moral force, and he accepted
   none which encouraged the selfish expectations of his nation--this very
   discrimination teaches us that it was from a deeper knowledge that he
   spoke and taught. But we possess testimonies of a much more striking
   kind. If anyone wants to know what the kingdom of God and the coming of
   it meant in Jesus' message, lie must read and study his parables. He
   will then see what it is that is meant. The kingdom of God comes by
   coming to the individual, by entering into his soul and laying hold of
   it. True, the kingdom of God is the rule of God; but it is the rule of
   the holy God in the hearts of individuals; it is God Himself in His
   power, From this point of view everything that is dramatic in the
   external and historical sense has vanished; and gone, too, are all the
   external hopes for the future. Take whatever parable you will, the
   parable of the sower, of the pearl of great price, of the treasure
   buried in the field--the word of God, God Himself, is the kingdom. It
   is not a question of angels and devils, thrones and principalities, but
   of God and the soul, the soul and its God.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE IV

   WE last spoke of Jesus' message in so far as it proclaimed the kingdom
   of God and its coining. We saw that it runs through all the forms in
   which the prophecy of the day of judgment is expressed in the Old
   Testament, up to the idea of an inward coming of the kingdom then
   beginning. Finally we tried to show why the latter idea is to be
   regarded as the dominant one. Before examining it more closely,
   however, I should like to draw your attention to two particularly
   important expressions of it, lying between the extremes of the "day of
   judgment" and the "inner coming."

   In the first of them, the coming of the kingdom of God signifies that
   the kingdom of the devil is destroyed and the demons vanquished.
   Hitherto it is they who have been ruling; they have taken possession of
   men and even of whole nations, and forced them to their will. Jesus not
   only declares that he is come to destroy the works of the devil, but he
   actually drives out the demons and releases men from their power.

   Let me here digress a little from our subject. Nothing in the Gospels
   strikes us as stranger than the frequently recurring stories of demons,
   and the great importance which the evangelists attach to them. For many
   among us the very fact that these writings report such absurdities is
   sufficient reason for declining to accept them. Now in this connexion
   it is well to know that absolutely similar stories are to be found in
   numerous writings of that age, Greek, Roman, and Jewish. The notion of
   people being "possessed" was current everywhere; nay, even the science
   of the time looked upon a whole section of morbid phenomena in this
   light. But the consequence of these phenomena being explained as
   meaning that some evil and invisible power had taken possession of a
   man was that mental affections took forms which looked as if an alien
   being had really entered into the soul. There is nothing paradoxical in
   this. If modern science were to declare nervous disease to consist, in
   great part, of "possession," and the newspapers were to spread this
   announcement amongst the public, the same thing would recur. We should
   soon have numerous cases in which nervous patients looked as if they
   were in the grip of an evil spirit and themselves believed that they
   were so. Theory and belief would work by suggestion and again create a
   class of "demoniacs" amongst the insane, just as they created them
   hundreds, nay, thousands, of years ago. It is unhistorical and foolish
   to attribute any peculiar notion or "theory" about demons and the
   demoniac to the Gospels and the evangelists. They only shared the
   general notions of their time. The forms of mental disease in question
   are of rare occurrence nowadays, but nevertheless they are not yet
   quite extinct. Where they occur the best means of encountering them is
   to-day, as it was formerly, the influence of a strong personality. It
   manages to threaten and subdue the "devil" and so heal the patient. In
   Palestine "demoniacs" must have been particularly numerous. Jesus saw
   in them the forces of evil and mischief, and by his marvellous power
   over the souls of those who trusted him he banished the disease. This
   brings us to the second point.

   When John the Baptist in prison was disturbed by doubts as to whether
   Jesus was "he who was to come," he sent two of his own disciples to him
   to ask him himself. There is nothing more touching than this question
   of the Baptist's, nothing more edifying than the Lord's answer. But we
   will not dwell upon the scene. What was the answer? "Go and shew John
   again those things which you do hear and see: the blind receive their
   sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
   the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them."
   That is what the "coming of the kingdom" means, or, rather, it is there
   already in this saving activity. By vanquishing and banishing misery,
   need and disease, by the actual influence which Jesus was exerting,
   John was to see that a new day had dawned. The healing of the possessed
   was only a part of this saving activity; the activity itself, however,
   was what Jesus denoted as the meaning and the seal of his mission. It
   was, then, to the wretched, to the sick, and to the poor, that he
   addressed himself; but not as a moralist and without any trace of,
   weak-minded sentimentality. He makes no division of evils into
   departments and groups; he spends no time in asking whether the sick
   one "deserves" to be healed; he is far, too, from having any sympathy
   for pain and death. He nowhere says that disease is salutary and that
   evil is a blessing. No! disease he calls disease, and health he calls
   health. To him all evil, all misery, is something terrible; it is part
   of the great realm of Satan. But he feels the power of the Saviour
   within him. He knows that progress is possible only by overcoming
   weakness and healing disease.

   But he goes further. It is by his healing, above all by his forgiving
   sin, that the kingdom of God comes. This is the first complete
   transition to the conception of the kingdom of God as the power that
   works inwardly. As he calls the sick and the poor to him, so he calls
   sinners also, and it is this call which is all-important. "The Son of
   Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." Here for the
   first time everything that is external and merely future is abandoned:
   it is the individual, not the nation or the state, which is redeemed;
   it is new men who are to arise, and the kingdom of God is to be at once
   their strength and the goal at which they aim. They search for the
   treasure hidden in the field and find it; they sell all that they have
   and buy the pearl of great price; they are converted and become as
   children; but thereby they are redeemed and made God's children and
   God's champions.

   It was in this connexion that Jesus spoke of the kingdom of God which
   the violent take by force, and, again, of the kingdom of God which
   grows steadily and silently like a seed and bears fruit. It is in the
   nature of spiritual force, a power which sinks into a man within, and
   can be understood only from within. Thus, although the kingdom is also
   in heaven; although it will come with the day of judgment, he can still
   say of it: "It is not here or there, it is within you."

   At a later period the view of the kingdom, according to which it was
   already come and still comes in Jesus' saving activity, was not kept up
   by his disciples: nay, they continued to speak of it as of something
   that was solely in the future. But the thing itself retained its force;
   it was only given another title. It underwent the same experience as
   the conception of the "Messiah." As we shall see hereafter, there was
   scarcely anyone in the Church of the Gentiles who sought to explain
   Jesus' significance by regarding him as the "Messiah." But the thing
   itself did not perish.

   The essential elements in the message of the kingdom were preserved.
   The kingdom has a triple meaning. Firstly, it is something
   supernatural, a gift from above, not a product of ordinary life.
   Secondly, it is a purely religious blessing, the inner link with the
   living God; thirdly, it is the most important experience that a. man
   can have, that on which everything else depends; it permeates and
   dominates his whole existence, because sin is forgiven and misery
   banished.

   This kingdom, which comes to the humble and makes them new men and
   joyful, is the key that first unlocks the meaning and the aim of life.
   This was what Jesus himself found, and what his disciples found. It is
   a supernatural element alone that ever enables us to get at the meaning
   of life; for natural existence ends in death. But a life that is bound
   up with death can have no meaning; it is only sophisms that can blind
   us to this fact. But here the kingdom of God, the Eternal, entered into
   time. "Eternal light came in and made the world look new." This is
   Jesus' message of the kingdom. Everything else that he proclaimed can
   be brought into connexion with this; his whole "doctrine" can be
   conceived as a message of the kingdom. But we shall recognise this, and
   the blessing which he means, still more clearly, if we turn to the sec
   and of the sections indicated in the previous lecture, and thereby
   progressively acquaint ourselves with the fundamental features of
   Jesus' message.

   II.--God the Father and the infinite value of the human soul.

   To our modern way of thinking and feeling, Christ's message appears in
   the clearest and most direct light when grasped in connexion with the
   idea of God the Father and the infinite value of the human soul. Here
   the elements which I would describe as the restful and restgiving in
   Jesus' message, and which are comprehended in the idea of our being
   children of God, find expression. I call them restful in contrast with
   the impulsive and stirring elements; although it is just they that are
   informed with a special strength. But the fact that the whole of Jesus'
   message may be reduced to these two heads God as the Father, and the
   human soul so ennobled that it can and does unite with him--shows us
   that the Gospel is in nowise a positive religion like the rest; that it
   contains no statutory or particularistic elements; that it is,
   therefore, religion itself. It is superior to all antithesis and
   tension between this world and a world to come, between reason and
   ecstasy, between work and isolation from the world, between Judaism and
   Hellenism. It can dominate them all, and there is no factor of earthly
   life to which it is confined or necessarily tied down. Let us, however,
   get a clearer idea of what being children of God, in Jesus' sense,
   means, by briefly considering four groups containing sayings of his,
   or, as the case may be, a single saying, viz.:--(1) The Lord's Prayer;
   (2) that utterance, "Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you;
   but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven"; (3) the
   saying, "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
   shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of
   your head are all. numbered"; (4) the utterance, "What shall it profit
   a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul"?

   Let us take the Lord's Prayer first. It was communicated by Jesus to
   his disciples at a particularly solemn moment. They had asked him to
   teach them how to pray, as John the Baptist had taught his disciples.
   Thereupon he uttered the Lord's Prayer. It is by their prayers that the
   character of the higher religions is determined. But this prayer was
   spoken--as everyone must feel who has ever given it a thought in his
   soul by one who has overcome all inner unrest, or overcomes it the
   moment that he goes before God. The very apostrophe of the prayer, "Our
   Father," exhibits the steady faith of the man who knows that he is safe
   in God, and it tells us that he is certain of being heard. Not to hurl
   violent desires at heaven or to obtain this or that earthly blessing
   does he pray, but to preserve the power which he already possesses and
   strengthen the union with God in which he lives. No one, then, can
   utter this prayer unless his heart is in profound peace and his mind
   wholly concentrated on the inner relation of the soul with God. All
   other prayers are of a lower order, for they contain particularistic
   elements, or . are so framed that in some way or other they stir the
   imagination in regard to the things of sense as well; whilst this
   prayer leads us away from everything to the height where the soul is
   alone with its God. And yet the earthly element is not absent. The
   whole of the second half of the prayer deals with earthly relations,
   but they are placed in the light of the Eternal. In vain will you look
   for any request for particular gifts of grace, or special blessings,
   even of a spiritual kind. "All else shall be added unto you." The name
   of God, His will, and His kingdom--these elements of rest and
   permanence are poured out over the earthly relations as well.
   Everything that is small and selfish melts away, and only four things
   are left with regard to which it is worth while to pray--the daily
   bread, the daily trespass, the daily temptations, and the evil in life.
   There is nothing in the Gospels that tells us more certainly what the
   Gospel is, and what sort of disposition and temper it produces, than
   the Lord's Prayer. With this prayer we ought also to confront all those
   who disparage the Gospel by representing it as an ascetic or ecstatic
   or sociological pronouncement. It shows the Gospel to be the Fatherhood
   of God applied to the whole of life; to be an inner, union with God's
   will and God's kingdom, and a joyous certainty of the possession of
   eternal blessings and protection from evil.

   As to the second utterance: when Jesus says "Rejoice not that the
   spirits are subject unto you, but rejoice rather that your names are
   written in heaven," it is another way of laying special emphasis on the
   idea that the all-important element in this religion is the
   consciousness of being safe in God. The greatest achievements, nay, the
   very works which are done in the strength of this religion, fall below
   the assurance, at once humble and proud, of resting for time and
   eternity under the fatherly care of God. Moreover, the genuineness,
   nay, the actual existence, of religious experience is to be measured,
   not by any transcendency of feeling nor by great deeds that all men can
   see, but by the joy and the peace which are diffused through the soul
   that can say "My Father."

   How far did Christ carry this idea of the fatherly providence of God?
   Here we come to the third saying: "Are not two sparrows sold for a
   farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your
   Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered." The
   assurance that God rules is to go as far as our fears go, nay, as far
   as life itself--life down even to its smallest manifestations in the
   order of Nature. It was to disabuse his disciples of the fear of evil
   and the terrors of death that he gave them the sayings about the
   sparrows and the flowers of the field; they are to learn how to see the
   hand of the living God everywhere in life, and in death too.

   Finally, in asking--and after what has gone before the question will
   not sound surprising--"What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the
   whole world and lose his own soul?" he put a man's value as high as it
   can be put. The man who can say "My Father" to the Being who rules
   heaven and earth, is thereby raised above heaven and earth, and himself
   has a value which is higher than all the fabric of this world. But this
   great saying took the stern tone of a warning. He offered them a gift
   and with it set them a task. How different was the Greek doctrine!
   Plato, it is true, had already sung the great hymn of the mind; he had
   distinguished it from the whole world of appearance and maintained its
   eternal origin. But the mind which he meant was the knowing mind; he
   contrasted it with blind, insensible matter; his message made its
   appeal to the wise. Jesus Christ calls to every poor soul; he calls to
   everyone who bears a human face: You are children of the living God,
   and not only better than many sparrows but of more value than the whole
   world. The value of a truly great man, as I saw it put lately, consists
   in his increasing the value of all mankind. It is here, truly, that the
   highest significance of great men lies: to have enhanced, that is, to
   have progressively given effect to human value, to the value of that
   race of men which has risen up out of the dull ground of Nature. But
   Jesus Christ was the first to bring the value of every human soul to
   light, and what he did no one can any more undo. We may take up what
   relation to him we will: in the history of the past no one can refuse
   to recognise that it was he who raised humanity to this level.

   This highest estimate of a man's value is based on a transvaluation of
   all values. To the man who boasts of his possessions he says: "Thou
   fool." He confronts everyone with the thought: "Whosoever will lose his
   life shall save it." He can even say: "He that hateth his life in this
   world shall keep it unto life eternal." This is the transvaluation of
   values of which many before him had a dim idea; of which they perceived
   the truth as through a veil; the redeeming power of which--that blessed
   mystery--they felt in advance. He was the first to give it calm,
   simple, and fearless expression, as though it were a truth which grew
   on every tree. It was just this that stamped his peculiar genius, that
   he gave perfectly simple expression to profound and all-important
   truths, as though they could not be otherwise; as though he were
   uttering something that was self-evident; as though he were only
   reminding men of what they all know already, because it lives in the
   innermost part of their souls.

   In the combination of these ideas--God the Father, Providence, the
   position of men as God's children, the infinite value of the human
   soul--the whole Gospel is expressed. But we must recognise what a
   paradox it all is; nay, that the paradox of religion here for the first
   time finds its full expression. Measured by the experience of the
   senses and by exact knowledge, not only are the different religions a
   paradox, but so are all religious phenomena. They introduce an element,
   and pronounce it to be the most important of all, which is not
   cognisable by the senses and flies in the face of things as they are
   actually constituted. But all religions other than Christianity are in
   some way or other so bound up with the things of the world that they
   involve an element of earthly advantage, or, as the case may be, are
   akin in their substance to the intellectual and spiritual condition of
   a definite epoch. But what can be less obvious than the statement: the
   hairs of your head are all numbered; you have a supernatural value; you
   can put yourselves into the hands of a power which no one has seen?
   Either that is nonsense, or else it is the utmost development of which
   religion is capable; no longer a mere phenomenon accompanying the life
   of the senses, a coefficient, a transfiguration of certain parts of
   that life, but something which sets up a paramount title to be the
   first and the only fact that reveals the fundamental basis and meaning
   of life. Religion subordinates to itself the whole motley world of
   phenomena, and defies that world if it claims to be the only real one.
   Religion gives us only a single experience, but one which presents the
   world in a new light: the Eternal appears; time becomes means to an
   end; man is seen to be on the side of the Eternal. This was certainly
   Jesus' meaning, and to take anything from it is to destroy it. In
   applying the idea of Providence to the whole of humanity and the world
   without any exception; in showing that humanity is rooted in the
   Eternal; in proclaiming the fact that we are God's children as at once
   a gift and a task, he took a firm grip of all fumbling and stammering
   attempts at religion and brought them to their issuer Once more let it
   be said: we may assume what position we will in regard to him and his
   message, certain it is that thence onward the value of our race is
   enhanced; human lives, nay, we ourselves, have become dearer to one
   another. A man may know it or not, but a real reverence for humanity
   follows from the practical recognition of God as the Father of us all.

   III.--The higher righteousness and the commandment of love.

   This is the third head, and the whole of the Gospel is embraced under
   it. To represent the Gospel as an ethical message is no depreciation of
   its value. The ethical system which Jesus found prevailing in his
   nation was both ample and profound. To judge the moral ideas of the
   Pharisees solely by their childish and casuistical aspects is not fair.
   By being bound up with religious worship and petrified in ritual
   observance, the morality of holiness had, indeed, been transformed into
   something that was the clean opposite of it. But all was not yet hard
   and dead; there was some life still left in the deeper parts of the
   system. To those who questioned him Jesus could still answer: "You have
   the law, keep it; you know best yourselves what you have to do; the sum
   of the law is, as you yourselves say, to love God and your neighbour."
   Nevertheless, there is a sphere of ethical thought which is peculiarly
   expressive of Jesus' Gospel. Let us make this clear by citing four
   points.

   Firstly: Jesus severed the connexion existing in his day between ethics
   and the external forms of religious worship and technical observance.
   He would have absolutely nothing to do with the purposeful and
   self-seeking pursuit of "good works" in combination with the ritual of
   worship. He exhibited an indignant contempt for those who allow their
   neighbours, nay, even their parents, to starve, and on the other hand
   send gifts to the temple. He will have no compromise in the matter.
   Love and mercy are ends in themselves; they lose all value and are put
   to shame by having to be anything else than the service of one's
   neighbour.

   Secondly: in all questions of morality he goes straight to the root,
   that is, to the disposition and the intention. It is only thus that
   what he calls the "higher righteousness" can be understood. The "higher
   righteousness" is the righteousness that will stand when the depths of
   the heart are probed. Here, again, we have something that is seemingly
   very simple and self-evident. Yet the truth, as he uttered it, took the
   severe form: "It was said of old . . . but I say unto you." After all,
   then, the truth was something new; he was aware that it had never yet
   been expressed in such a consistent form and with such claims to
   supremacy. A large portion of the so-called Sermon on the Mount is
   occupied with what he says when he goes in detail through the several
   departments of human relationships and human failings so as to bring
   the disposition and intention to light in each case, to judge a man's
   works by them, and on them to hang heaven and hell.

   Thirdly: what he freed from its connexion with self-seeking and ritual
   elements, and recognised as the moral principle, he reduces to one root
   and to one motive--love. He knows of no other, and love itself, whether
   it takes the form of love of one's neighbour or of one's enemy, or the
   love of the Samaritan, is of one kind only. It must completely fill
   the, soul; it is what remains when the soul dies to itself. In this
   sense of love is the new life already begun. But it is always the love
   which serves, and only in this function does it exist and live.

   Fourthly: we saw that Jesus freed the moral element from all alien
   connexions, even from its alliance with the public religion. Therefore
   to say that the Gospel is a matter of ordinary morality is not to
   misunderstand him. And yet there is one all-important point where he
   combines religion and morality. It is a point which must be felt; it is
   not easy to define. In view of the Beatitudes it may, perhaps, best be
   described as humility. Jesus made love and humility one. Humility is
   not a virtue by itself; but it is pure receptivity, the expression of
   inner need, the prayer for God's grace and forgiveness, in a word, the
   opening up of the heart to God. In Jesus' view, this humility, which is
   the love of God of which we are capable--take, for instance, the
   parable of the Pharisee and the publican--is an abiding disposition
   towards the good, and that out of which everything that is good springs
   and grows. "Forgive us our trespasses even as we forgive them that
   trespass against us" is the prayer at once of humility and of love.
   This, then, is the source and origin of the love of one's neighbour;
   the poor in spirit and those who hunger and thirst after righteousness
   are also the peacemakers and the merciful.

   It was in this sense that Jesus combined religion and morality, and in
   this sense religion may be called the soul of morality, and morality
   the body of religion. We can thus understand how it was that Jesus
   could place the love of God and the love of one's neighbour side by
   side; the love of one's neighbour is the only practical proof on earth
   of that love of God which is strong in humility.

   In thus expressing his message of the higher righteousness and the new
   commandment of love in these four leading thoughts, Jesus defined the
   sphere of the ethical in a way in which no one before him had ever
   defined it. But should we be threatened with doubts as to what he
   meant, we must steep ourselves again and again in the Beatitudes of the
   Sermon on the Mount. They contain his ethics and his religion, united
   at the root, and freed from all external and particularistic elements.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE V

   AT the close of the last lecture I referred to the Beatitudes, and
   mentioned that they exhibit Jesus' religion in a particularly
   impressive way. I desire to remind you of another passage which shows
   that Jesus recognised the practical proof of religion to consist in the
   exercise of neighbourly love and mercy. In one of his last discourses
   he spoke of the Judgment, bringing it before his hearers' eyes in the
   parable of the shepherd separating the sheep from the goats. The sole
   principle of separation is the question of mercy. The question is
   raised by asking whether men gave food and drink to Jesus himself, and
   visited him; that is to say, it is put as a religious question. The
   paradox is then resolved in the sentence: "Inasmuch as ye have done it
   unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
   We can have no clearer illustration of the fact that in Jesus' view
   mercy was the quality on which everything turned, and that the temper
   in which it is exercised is the guarantee that a man's religious
   position is the right one. How so? Because in exercising this virtue
   men are imitating God: "Be merciful, even as your Father in heaven is
   merciful." He who exercises mercy exercises God's prerogative; for
   God's justice is not accomplished by keeping to the rule, "an eye for
   an eye and a tooth for a tooth," but is subject to the power of His
   mercy.

   Let us pause here for a moment. The history of religion marked an
   enormous advance, religion itself was established afresh, when through
   poets and thinkers in Greece on the one hand, and through the prophets
   in Palestine on the other, the idea of righteousness and a righteous
   God became a living force and transformed tradition. The gods were
   raised to a higher level and civilised; the warlike and capricious
   Jehovah became a holy Being in whose court of judgment a man might
   trust, albeit in fear and trembling. The two great provinces of
   religion and morality, hitherto separated, were now brought into close
   relation; for "the Godhead is holy and just." It is our history that
   was then developed; for without that all-important transformation there
   would be no such thing as "mankind," no such thing as a "history of the
   world" in the higher sense. The most immediate result of this
   development may be summed up in the maxim: "What ye would not that men
   should do unto you, do ye also not unto them." Insufficient and prosaic
   as the rule may seem, yet, if extended so as to cover all human
   relationships and really observed, it contains a civilising force of
   enormous strength.

   But it does not contain the ultimate step. Not until justice was
   compelled to give way to mercy, and the idea of brotherhood and
   self-sacrifice in the service of one's neighbour became
   paramount--another re-establishment of religion--was the last advance
   accomplished that it was possible and necessary to make. Its maxim,
   "What ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them," also
   seems prosaic; and yet rightly understood it leads to the summit and
   comprises a new method of apprehension, and a new way of judging one's
   own life. The thought that "he who loses his life shall save it," runs
   side by side with this maxim and effects a transvaluation of values, in
   the certainty that a man's true life is not tied to this span of time
   and is not rooted in material existence.

   I hope that I have thus shown, although briefly, that in the sphere of
   thought which is indicated by "the higher righteousness" and "the new
   commandment of love" Jesus' teaching is also contained in its entirety.
   As a matter of fact, the three spheres which we have distinguished--the
   kingdom of God, God as the Father and the infinite value of the human
   soul, and the higher righteousness showing itself in love--coalesce;
   for ultimately the kingdom is nothing but the treasure which the soul
   possesses in the eternal and merciful God. It needs only a few touches
   to develop this thought into everything that, taking Jesus' sayings as
   its groundwork, Christendom has known and strives to maintain as hope,
   faith, and love.

   To proceed: Now that we have established the fundamental
   characteristics of Jesus' message, let us try, in the second place, to
   treat of the main bearings of the Gospel as applied to individual
   problems. There are six points or questions which call for special
   attention, as being the most important in themselves, and consequently
   felt and regarded as such in all ages. And although, in the course of
   the Church's history, one or other of these questions may have passed
   into the background for a decade or two, it has always reappeared
   afresh, and with redoubled force:--

   (1) The Gospel and the world, or the question of asceticism;

   (2) The Gospel and the poor, or the social question;

   (3) The Gospel and law, or the question of public order;

   (4) The Gospel and work, or the question of civilisation;

   (5) The Gospel and the Son of God, or the Christological question;

   (6) The Gospel and doctrine, or the question of creed.

   By these six questions--the first four hang together, and the last two
   stand by themselves--I hope to be able to exhibit, of course only in
   outline, the most important bearings of Jesus' message.

   (1) The Gospel and the world, or the question of asceticism.

   There is a widespread opinion--it is dominant in the Catholic churches
   and many Protestants share it nowadays--that, in the last resort and in
   the most important things which it enjoins, the Gospel is a strictly
   world-shunning and ascetic creed. Some people proclaim this piece of
   intelligence with sympathy and admiration; nay, they magnify it into
   the contention that the whole value and meaning of genuine
   Christianity, as of Buddhism, lies in its world-denying character.
   Others emphasise the world-shunning doctrines of the Gospel in order
   thereby to expose its incompatibility with modern ethical principles,
   and to prove its uselessness as a religion. The Catholic churches have
   found a curious way out of the difficulty and one which is, in reality,
   a product of despair. They recognise, as I have said, the world-denying
   character of the Gospel, and they teach, accordingly, that it is only
   in the form of monasticism--that is, in the "vita religiosa"--that true
   Christian life finds its expression. But they admit a "lower" kind of
   Christianity without asceticism, as "sufficient." We will say nothing
   about this strange concession now; the Catholic doctrine is that it is
   only monks who can follow Christ fully. With this doctrine a great
   philosopher, and a still greater writer, of the nineteenth century, has
   made common cause. Schopenhauer extols Christianity because, and in so
   far as, it has produced great ascetics like St. Anthony or St. Francis;
   but, beyond that, everything in the Christian message seems to him to
   be useless and a stumbling-block. With a much deeper insight than
   Schopenhauer, and with a strength of feeling and power of language that
   carry us away, Tolstoi has emphasised the ascetic and world-shunning
   features of the Gospel, and erected them into a rule of observance.
   That the ascetic ideal which he derives from the Gospel is endowed with
   warmth and strength, and includes the service of one's neighbour, is a
   fact which we cannot deny; but to him, too, the shunning of the world
   is the leading characteristic of Christianity. There are thousands of
   our "educated" readers who find his stories suggestive and exciting,
   but who at the bottom of their hearts are pleased and relieved to know
   that Christianity means the denial of the world; for then they know
   very well that it does not concern them. They are certain, and rightly
   certain, that this world is given them to be made the best of, within
   the bounds of its own blessings and its own regulations; and that if
   Christianity makes any other claim, it thereby shows that it is
   unnatural. If Christianity has no goal to set before this life; if it
   transfers everything to a Beyond; if it declares all earthly blessings
   to be valueless, and points exclusively to a world-shunning and
   contemplative life, it is an offence to all energetic, nay, ultimately,
   to all true natures; for such natures are certain that our faculties
   are given us to be employed, and that the earth is assigned to us to be
   cultivated and subdued.

   But is not the Gospel really a world-denying creed? Certain very
   well-known passages are appealed to which do not seem to admit of any
   other interpretation: "If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and
   cast it from thee"; "If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off"; or the
   answer to the rich young man: "Go and sell that thou hast, and give to
   the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven"; or the saying about
   those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
   sake; or the utterance: "If any man come to me, and hate not his
   father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren and sisters,
   yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." These and other
   passages seem to settle the matter, and to prove that the Gospel is
   altogether world-shunning and ascetic in its character. But to this
   thesis I oppose three considerations which point in another direction.
   The first is derived from the way in which Jesus came forward, and from
   his manner and course of life; the second is based upon the impression
   which he made upon his disciples and was reflected in their own lives;
   the third springs from what we said about the fundamental features of
   Jesus' message.

   1. We find in our Gospels a remarkable utterance by Jesus, as follows:
   "John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
   The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
   gluttonous and a wine-bibber." A glutton, then, and a wine-bibber was
   he called in addition to the other abusive names which were given him.
   From this it clearly follows that in his whole demeanour and manner of
   life he made an impression quite different from that of the preacher of
   repentance on the banks of the Jordan. Towards the various fields in
   which asceticism had been traditionally practised, he must have taken
   up an attitude of indifference. We see him in the houses of the rich
   and of the poor, at meals, with women and amongst children; according
   to tradition, even at a wedding. He allows his feet to be washed and
   his head to be anointed. Further, he is glad to lodge with Mary and
   Martha; he does not ask them to leave their home. When he finds, to his
   joy, people with a firm faith, he leaves them in the calling and the
   position in which they were. We do not hear of his telling them to sell
   all and follow him. Apparently he thinks it possible, nay, fitting,
   that they should live unto their belief in the position in which God
   has placed them. His circle of disciples is not exhausted by the few
   whom he summoned directly to follow him. He finds God's children
   everywhere; to discover them in their obscurity and to be allowed to
   speak to them some word of strength is his highest pleasure. But he did
   not organise his disciples into a band of monks, and he gave them no
   directions as to what they were to do and leave undone in the life of
   the day. No one who reads the Gospels with an unprejudiced mind, and
   does not pick his words, can fail to acknowledge that this free and
   active spirit does not appear to be bent under the yoke of asceticism,
   and that such words, therefore, as point in this direction must not be
   taken in a rigid sense and generalised, but must be regarded in a wider
   connexion and from a higher point of view.

   2. It is certain that the disciples did not understand their master to
   be a world-shunning ascetic. We shall see later what sacrifices they
   made for the Gospel and in what sense they renounced the world. But it
   is evident they did not give ascetic practices the chief place; they
   maintained the rule that the labourer is worthy of his hire; they did
   not send away their wives. We are incidentally told of Peter that his
   wife accompanied him on his missionary journeys. Apart from what we are
   told of an attempt to institute a kind of communism in the congregation
   at Jerusalem--and we may put it aside, as it is not trustworthy and,
   moreover, bore no ascetic character--we find nothing in the apostolic
   age which suggests a community of men who were ascetics on principle;
   on the contrary, we find the conviction prevailing everywhere that it
   is within the given circumstances, in the calling and position in which
   he finds himself, that a man is to be a Christian. How differently
   things developed in Buddhism from the very start!

   3. The all-important consideration is the third. Let me remind you of
   what we said in regard to Jesus' leading thoughts. In the sphere
   indicated by trust in God, humility, the forgiveness of sins and the
   love of one's neighbour, there is no room for the introduction of any
   other maxim, least of all for one of a legal character. At the same
   time Jesus makes it clear in what sense the kingdom of God is the
   antithesis of the world. The man who associates any ascetic practice
   with the words "Take no thought," "Be Be merciful even as your Father
   in heaven is merciful," and so on, and puts it upon the same level as
   those words, does not understand the sublime character of these
   sayings, and has either lost or has never attained the feeling that
   there is a union with God in which all such questions as shunning the
   world and asceticism ire left far behind.

   For these reasons we must decline to regard the Gospel as a message of
   world-denial.

   On the other hand, Jesus speaks of three enemies, and the watchword
   which he gives in dealing with them is not that we are to flee them;
   rather, he commands us to annihilate them. These three enemies are
   mammon, care, and selfishness. Observe that here there is no question
   of flight or denial, but of a battle which is to be fought until the
   enemy is annihilated; the forces of darkness are to be overthrown. By
   mammon he understands money and worldly goods in the widest sense of
   the word, worldly goods which try to gain the mastery over us, and make
   us tyrants over others; for money is "compressed force." Jesus speaks
   of this enemy as if it were a person, as if it were a knight in armour,
   or a king; nay, as if it were the devil himself. It is at this enemy
   that the saying, "Ye cannot serve two masters," is aimed. Wherever
   anything belonging to the domain of mammon is of such value to a man
   that he sets his heart upon it, that he trembles at the thought of
   losing it, that he is no longer willing to give it up, such a man is
   already in bondage. Hence, when the Christian feels that this danger
   confronts him, he is not to treat with the enemy, but to fight, and not
   fight only but also destroy the mammon. Were Christ to preach among us
   to-day, he would certainly not talk in general terms, and say to
   everyone, "give away everything you have"; but there are thousands
   among us to whom he would so speak, and that there is scarcely anyone
   who feels compelled to apply these sayings of the Gospel to himself is
   a fact that ought to make us suspicious.

   The second enemy is care. At first sight it may surprise us that Jesus
   should describe care as so terrible a foe. He ranks it with
   "heathenism." It is true that in the Lord's Prayer he also taught men
   to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread"; but a confident request of
   this kind he does not call care. The care which he means is that which
   makes us timorous slaves of the day and of material things; the care
   through which bit by bit we fall a prey to the world. Care is to him an
   outrage on God, who preserves the very sparrows on the housetop; it
   destroys the fundamental relation with the Father in heaven, the
   childlike trust, and thus ruins our inmost soul. This is also a point
   in regard to which, as in respect to mammon, we must confess that we do
   not feel deeply and strongly enough to recognise the full truth of
   Jesus' message. But the question is, Who is right--he with the
   inexorable "Take no thought," or we with our debilitating fears? We,
   too, in a measure feel that a man is not really free, strong, and
   invincible, until he has put aside all his cares and cast them upon
   God. How much we could accomplish and how strong we should be, if we
   did not fret.

   And then, thirdly: selfishness. It is self-denial, not asceticism,
   which Jesus requires; self-denial. to the point of self-renunciation.
   "If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out; if thy right hand offend
   thee, cut it off." Wherever some desire of the senses gains the upper
   hand of you, so that you become coarse and vulgar, or in your
   selfishness a new master arises in you, you must destroy it; not
   because God has any pleasure in mutilation, but because you cannot
   otherwise preserve your better part. It is a hard demand. But it is not
   met by any act of general renunciation, such as monks perform the act
   may leave things just as they were before--but only by a struggle and a
   resolute renunciation at the critical point.

   With all these enemies, mammon, care, and selfishness, what we have to
   exercise is self-denial, and therewith the relation of Christianity to
   asceticism is determined. Asceticism maintains the theory that all
   worldly blessings are in themselves of no value. This is not the theory
   to which we should be led if we were to go by the Gospel; "for the
   earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof." But according to the
   Gospel a man is to ask: Can and ought I to regard property and honour,
   friends and relations as blessings, or must I put them away? If certain
   of Jesus' sayings to this effect have been handed down to us in a
   general form and were, no doubt, so uttered, still they must be limited
   by the whole tenor of his discourses. What the Gospel asks of us is
   solemnly to examine ourselves, to maintain an earnest watch, and to
   destroy the enemy. There can be no doubt, however, that Jesus demanded
   self-denial and self-renunciation to a much greater extent than we like
   to think.

   To sum up: Ascetic in the primary meaning of the word the Gospel is
   not; for it is a message of trust in God, of humility, of forgiveness
   of sin, and of mercy. This is a height which nothing else can approach,
   and into this sphere nothing else can force its way. Further, worldly
   blessings are not of the devil but of God--"Your heavenly Father
   knoweth that ye have need of all these things; he arrays the lilies of
   the field and feeds the fowls of the air." Asceticism has no place in
   the Gospel at all; what it asks is that we should struggle against
   mammon, against care, against selfishness; what it demands and
   disengages is love; the love that serves and is self-sacrificing. This
   struggle and this love are the kind of asceticism which the Gospel
   means, and whoever encumbers Jesus' message with any other kind fails
   to understand it. He fails to understand its grandeur and its
   importance; for there is something still more important than "giving
   one's body to be burned and bestowing all one's goods to feed the
   poor," namely, self-denial and love.

   (2) The Gospel and the poor, or the social question.

   The bearings of the Gospel in regard to the social question form the
   second point which we proposed to consider. It is closely akin to the
   first. Here also we encounter different views prevalent at the present
   moment, or, to be more exact, two views, which are mutually opposed. We
   are told, on the one hand, that the Gospel was in the main a great
   social message to the poor, and that everything else in it is of
   secondary importance--mere contemporary wrapping, ancient tradition, or
   new forms supplied by the first generations of Christians. Jesus, they
   say, was a great social reformer, who aimed at relieving the lower
   classes from the wretched condition in which they were languishing; he
   set up a social programme which embraced the equality of all men,
   relief from economical distress, and deliverance from misery and
   oppression. It is only so, they add, that he can be understood, and
   therefore so he was; or perhaps--so he was, because it is only so that
   we can understand him. For years books and pamphlets have been written
   dealing with the Gospel in this sense; well-meant performances which
   aim at thus providing Jesus with a defence and a recommendation. But
   amongst those who take the Gospel to be an essentially social message
   there are also some who draw the opposite conclusion. By trying to
   prove that Jesus' message was wholly directed to bringing about an
   economical reform, they declare the Gospel to be an entirely Utopian
   and useless programme; the view, they say, which Jesus took of the
   world was gentle, but also weak; coming himself from the lower and
   oppressed classes, he shared the suspicion entertained by small people
   of the great and the rich; he abhorred all profitable trade and
   business; he failed to understand the necessity of acquiring wealth;
   and accordingly he shaped his programme so as to disseminate pauperism
   in the "world"--to him the world was Palestine--and then, by way of
   contrast with the misery on earth, to build up a kingdom in heaven; a
   programme unrealisable in itself, and offensive to men of energy. This,
   or something like this, is the view held by another section of those
   who identify the Gospel with a social message.

   Opposed to this group of persons, united in the way in which they look
   at the Gospel but divided in their opinions in regard to it, there is
   another group upon whom it makes quite a different impression. They
   assert that as for any direct interest on Jesus' part in the economical
   and social conditions of his age; nay, further, as for any rudimentary
   interest in economical questions in general, it is only read into the
   Gospel, and that with economical questions the Gospel has absolutely
   nothing to do. Jesus, they say, certainly borrowed illustrations and
   examples from the domain of economics, and took a personal interest in
   the poor, the sick, and the miserable, but his purely religious
   teaching and his saving activity were in no way directed to any
   improvement in their earthly position: to say that his objects and
   intentions were of a social character is to secularise them. Nay, there
   are not a few among us who think him, like themselves, a
   "Conservative," who respected all these existing social differences and
   ordinances as "divinely ordained."

   The voices which make themselves heard here are, as you will observe,
   very different, and the different points of view are defended with zeal
   and pertinacity. Now, if we are to try to find the position which
   corresponds to the facts, there is, first of all, a brief remark to be
   made on the age in which Jesus lived. Our knowledge of the social
   conditions in Palestine in his age and for some considerable time
   previously does not go very far; but there are certain leading features
   of it which we can establish, and two things more particularly which we
   can assert.

   The governing classes, to which, above all, the Pharisees, and also the
   priests, belonged--the latter partly in alliance with the temporal
   rulers--had little feeling for the needs of the people. The condition
   of those classes may not have been much worse than it generally is at
   all times and in all nations, but it was bad. Moreover, there was here
   the additional circumstance that mercy and sympathy with the poor had
   been put into the background by devotion to public worship and to the
   cult of "righteousness." Oppression and tyranny on the part of the rich
   had long become a standing and inexhaustible theme with the Psalmists
   and with all men of any warm feelings. Jesus, too, could not have
   spoken of the rich as he did speak, unless they had grossly neglected
   their duties.

   In the poor and oppressed classes, in the huge mass of want and evil,
   amongst the multitude of people for whom the word "misery" is often
   only another expression for the word "life," nay, is life itself--in
   this multitude there were groups of people at that time, as we can
   surely see, who, with fervent and steadfast hope, were hanging upon the
   promises and consoling words of their God, waiting in humility and
   patience for the day when their deliverance was to come. Often too poor
   to pay even for the barest advantages and privileges of public worship,
   oppressed, thrust aside, and unjustly treated, they could not raise
   their eyes to the temple; but they looked to the God of Israel, and
   fervent prayers went up to Him: "Watchman, what of the night?" Thus
   their hearts were opened to God and ready to receive Him, and in many
   of the Psalms, and in the later Jewish literature which was akin to
   them, the word "poor" directly denotes those who have their hearts open
   and are waiting for the consolation of Israel. Jesus found this usage
   of speech in existence and adopted it. Therefore when we come across
   the expression "the poor" in the Gospels we must not think, without
   further ceremony, of the poor in the economic sense. As a matter of
   fact, poverty in the economic sense coincided to a large extent in
   those days with religious humility and an openness of the heart towards
   God, in contrast with the elevated "practice of virtue" of the
   Pharisees and its routine observance in "righteousness." But if this
   were the prevailing condition of affairs, then it is clear that our
   modern categories of "poor" and "rich" cannot be unreservedly
   transferred to that age. Yet we must not forget that in those days the
   economical sense was also, as a rule, included in the word "poor." We
   shall, therefore, have to examine in our next lecture the direction in
   which a distinction can be made, or perhaps to ask, whether it is
   possible to fix the inner sense of Jesus' words in spite of the
   peculiar difficulty attaching to the conception of "poverty." We can
   have some confidence, however, that we shall not have to remain in
   obscurity on this point; for in its fundamental features the Gospel
   also throws a bright light upon the field covered by this question.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE VI

   AT the close of the last lecture I referred to the problem presented by
   "the poor" in the Gospel. As a rule, the poor of whom Jesus was
   thinking were also those whose hearts are open towards God, and hence
   what is said of them cannot be applied without further ceremony to the
   poor generally. In considering the social question we must, therefore,
   put aside all those sayings of Jesus which obviously refer to the poor
   in the spiritual sense. These include, for instance, the first
   Beatitude, whether we accept it in the form in which it appears in Luke
   or in Matthew. The Beatitudes associated with it make it clear that
   Jesus was thinking of the poor whose hearts were inwardly open towards
   God. But, as we have no time to go through all the sayings separately,
   we must content ourselves with some leading considerations in order to
   establish the most important points.

   Jesus regarded the possession of worldly goods as a grave danger for
   the soul, as hardening the heart, entangling us in earthly cares, and
   seducing us into a vulgar life of pleasure. "A rich man shall hardly
   enter the kingdom of heaven."

   The contention that Jesus desired, so to speak, to about a general
   condition of poverty and distress, in order that he might afterwards
   make it the basis of his kingdom of heaven--a contention which we
   encounter in different forms--is erroneous. The very opposite is the
   case. Want he called want, and evil he called evil. Far prom showing
   them any favour, he made the greatest and strongest efforts to combat
   and destroy them. In this sense, too, his whole activity was a saving
   activity, that is to say, a struggle against evil and against want.
   Nay, we might almost think that he over-estimated the depressing load
   of poverty and affliction; that he occupied himself too much with it;
   and that, taking the moral bearings of life as a whole, he attributed
   too great an importance to those forces of sympathy and mercy which are
   expected to counteract this state of things. But neither, of course,
   would this view be correct. He knows of a power which he thinks still
   worse than want and misery, namely, sin; and he knows of a force still
   more emancipating than mercy, namely, forgiveness. His discourses and
   actions leave no doubt upon this point. It is certain, therefore, that
   Jesus never and nowhere wished to keep up poverty and misery, but, on
   the contrary, he combated them himself and bid others combat them. The
   Christians who in the course of the Church's history were for
   countenancing mendicancy and recommending universal pauperisation, or
   sentimentally coquetted with misery and distress, cannot with any show
   of reason appeal to him. Upon those, however, who were anxious to
   devote their whole lives to the preaching of the Gospel and the
   ministry of the Word--he did not ask this of everyone, but regarded it
   as a special calling from God and a special gift--upon them he enjoined
   the renunciation of all that they had, that is to say, all worldly
   goods. Yet that does not mean that he relegated them to a life of
   beggary. On the contrary, they were to be certain that they would find
   their bread and their means of livelihood. What he meant by that we
   learn from a saying of his which was accidentally omitted from the
   Gospels, but has been handed down to us by the apostle Paul. In the
   ninth chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians he writes: "The
   Lord hath ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the
   gospel." An absence of worldly possessions he required of the ministers
   of the Word, that is, of the missionaries, in order that they might
   live entirely for their calling. But he did not mean that they were to
   beg. This is a Franciscan misconception which is perhaps suggested by
   Jesus' words but "carries us away from his meaning.

   In this connexion allow me to digress for a moment from our subject.
   Those members of the Christian churches who have become professional
   evangelists or ministers of the Word in their parishes have not, as a
   rule, found it necessary to follow the Lord's injunction to dispossess
   themselves of their worldly goods. So far as priests or pastors, as the
   case may be, and not missionaries, are concerned, it may be said with
   some justice that the injunction does not refer to them; for it
   presupposes that a man has undertaken the office of propagating the
   Gospel. It may be said, further, that the Lord's injunctions, over and
   above those relating to the commandment of love, must not be made into
   inviolable laws, as otherwise Christian liberty will be impaired, and
   the high privilege of the Christian religion to adapt its shape to the
   course of history, free from all constraint, will be prejudiced. But
   still it may be asked whether it would not have been an extraordinary
   gain to Christianity if those who are called to be its ministers,--the
   missionaries and pastors, had followed the Lord's rules. At the very
   least, it ought to be a strict principle with them to concern
   themselves with property and worldly goods only so far as will prevent
   them being a burden to others, and beyond that to renounce them. I
   entertain no doubt that the time will come when the world will tolerate
   a life of luxury among those who are charged with the cure of souls as
   little as it tolerates priestly government. Our feelings in this
   respect are becoming finer, and that is an advantage. It will no longer
   be thought fitting, in the higher sense of the word, for anyone to
   preach resignation and contentment to the poor, who is well off
   himself, and zealously concerned for the increase of his property. A
   healthy man may well offer consolation to the sick; but how shall a man
   of property convince those who have none that worldly goods are of no
   value? The Lord's injunction that the minister of the Word is to divest
   himself of worldly possessions will still come to be honoured in the
   history of his communion.

   Jesus laid down no social programme for the suppression of poverty and
   distress, if by programme we mean a set of definitely prescribed
   regulations. With economical conditions and contemporary circumstances
   he did not interfere. Had he become entangled in them; had he given
   laws which were ever so salutary for Palestine, what would have been
   gained by it? They would have served the needs of a day, and to-morrow
   would have been antiquated; to the Gospel they would have been a burden
   and a source of confusion. We must be careful not to exceed the limits
   set to such injunctions as "Give to him that asketh thee" and others of
   a similar kind. They must be understood in connexion with the time and
   the situation. They refer to the immediate wants of the applicant,
   which were satisfied with a piece of bread, a drink of water, an
   article of clothing to cover his nakedness. We must remember that in
   the Gospel we are in the East, and in circumstances which from an
   economical point of view are somewhat undeveloped. Jesus was no social
   reformer. He could say on occasion, "The poor ye have always with you,"
   and thereby, it seems, indicate that the conditions would undergo no
   essential change. He refused to be a judge between contending heirs,
   and a thousand problems of economics and social life he would have just
   as resolutely put aside as the unreasonable demand that he would settle
   a question of inheritance. Yet again and again people have ventured to
   deduce some concrete social programme from the Gospel. Even evangelical
   theologians have made the attempt, and are still making it--an
   endeavour hopeless in itself and full of danger, but absolutely
   bewildering and intolerable when the people try to "fill up the
   gaps"--and they are many--to be found in the Gospel with regulations
   and programmes drawn from the Old Testament.

   No religion, not even Buddhism, ever went to work with such an
   energetic social message, and so strongly identified itself with that
   message as we see to be the case in the Gospel. How so? Because the
   words "Love thy neighbour as thyself" were spoken in deep earnest;
   because with these words Jesus turned a light upon all the concrete
   relations of life, upon the world of hunger, poverty and misery;
   because, lastly, he uttered them as a religious, nay, as the religious
   maxim. Let me remind you once more of the parable of the Last Judgment,
   where the whole question of a man's worth and destiny is made dependent
   on whether he has practised the love of his neighbour; let me remind
   you of the other parable of the rich man and poor Lazarus. I should
   like to cite another story, too, which is little known, because it
   occurs in this wording not in our four Gospels but in the Gospel of the
   Hebrews. The story of the rich young man is there handed down as
   follows:

   A rich man said to the Lord: Master, what good must I do that I may
   have life? He answered him: Man, keep the law and the prophets. The
   other answered: That have I done. He said to him: Go, sell all thy
   possessions and distribute them to the poor, and come and follow me.
   Then the rich man began to scratch his head, and the speech did not
   please him. And the Lord said to him: How canst thou say: I have kept
   the law and the prophets, as it is written in the law, Love thy
   neighbour as thyself? Behold, many of thy brethren, sons of Abraham,
   lie in dirty rags and die of hunger, and thy house is full of many
   goods, and nothing comes out of it to them.

   You observe how Jesus felt the material wants of the poor, and how he
   deduced a remedy for such distress from the commandment: "Love thy
   neighbour as thyself." People ought not to speak of loving their
   neighbours if they can allow men beside them to starve and die in
   misery. It is not only that the Gospel preaches solidarity and the
   helping of others; it is in this message that its real import consists.
   In this sense it is profoundly socialistic, just as it is also
   profoundly individualistic, because it establishes the infinite and
   independent value of every human soul. Its tendency to union and
   brotherliness is not so much an accidental phenomenon in its history as
   the essential feature of its character. The Gospel aims at founding a
   community among men as wide as human life itself and as deep as human
   need. As has been truly said, its object is to transform the socialism
   which rests on the basis of conflicting interests into the socialism
   which rests on the consciousness of a spiritual unity. In this sense
   its social message can never be outbid. In the course of the ages
   people's opinions as to what constitutes "an existence worthy of a man"
   have, thank God, become much changed and improved. But Jesus, too, knew
   of this way of measuring things. Did he not once refer, almost
   bitterly, to his own position: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of
   the air have nests: but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head"?
   A dwelling, sufficient daily bread, cleanliness--all these needs he
   touched upon, and their satisfaction he held to be necessary, and a
   condition of earthly life. If a man cannot procure them for himself,
   others are to step in and do it for him. There can be no doubt,
   therefore, that if Jesus were with us to-day he would side with those
   who are making great efforts to relieve the hard lot of the poor and
   procure them better conditions of life. The fallacious principle of the
   free play of forces, of the "live and let live" principle--a better
   name for it would be the "live and let die"--is entirely opposed to the
   Gospel. And it is not as our servants, but as our brothers, that we are
   to help the poor.

   Lastly, our riches do not belong to us alone. The Gospel has prescribed
   no regulations as to how we are to use them, but it leaves us in no
   doubt that we are to regard ourselves not as owners but as
   administrators in the service of our neighbour. Nay, it almost looks as
   if Jesus contemplated the possibility of a union among men in which
   wealth, as private property in the strict sense of the word, was
   non-existent. Here, however, we touch upon a question which is not easy
   to decide, and which, perhaps, ought not to be raised at all, because
   Jesus' eschatological ideas and his particular horizon enter into it.
   Nor is it a question that we need raise. It is the disposition which
   Jesus kindled in his disciples towards poverty and want that is
   all-important.

   The Gospel is a social message, solemn and overpowering in its force;
   it is the proclamation of solidarity and brotherliness, in favour of
   the poor. But the message is bound up with the recognition of the
   infinite value of the human soul, and is contained in what Jesus said
   about the kingdom of God. We may also assert that it is an essential
   part of what . he there said. But laws or ordinances or injunctions
   bidding us forcibly alter the conditions of the age in which we may
   happen to be living are not to be found in the Gospel.

   (3) The Gospel and the law, or the question of public order.

   The problem dealing with the relation of the Gospel to law embraces two
   leading questions: (I) the relation of the Gospel to constituted
   authority; (2) the relation of the Gospel to legal ordinances
   generally, in so far as they possess a wider range than is covered by
   the conception "constituted authority." It is not easy to mistake the
   answer to the first question, but the second is more complicated and
   beset with greater difficulties; and very diverse opinions are
   entertained in regard to it.

   As to Jesus' relation to the constituted authorities of his day, I need
   scarcely remind you again in express terms that he was no political
   revolutionary, and that he laid down no political programme. Although
   he is sure that his Father would send him twelve legions of angels were
   he to ask Him, he did not ask Him. When they wanted to make him a king,
   he disappeared. Ultimately, indeed, when he thought well to reveal
   himself to the whole nation as the Messiah--how he came to the decision
   and carried it out are points in which we are left in the dark--he made
   his entry into Jerusalem as a king; but of the modes of presenting
   himself which prophecy suggested, he chose that which was most remote
   from a political manifestation. The way in which he understood his
   Messianic duty is shown by his driving the buyers and sellers from the
   temple. In this cleansing of the temple it was not the constituted
   authorities whom he attacked, but those who had assumed to themselves
   rights of authority over the soul. In every nation, side by side with
   the constituted authorities, an unconstituted authority is established,
   or rather two unconstituted authorities. They are the political church
   and the political parties. What the political church wants, in the
   widest sense of the word and under very various guises, is to rule; to
   get hold of men's souls and bodies, consciences and worldly goods. What
   political parties want is the same; and when the heads of these parties
   set themselves up as popular leaders, a terrorism is developed which is
   often worse than the fear of royal despots. It was not otherwise in
   Palestine in Jesus' day. The priests and the Pharisees held the nation
   in bondage and murdered its soul. For this unconstituted "authority"
   Jesus showed a really emancipating and refreshing disrespect. He was
   never tired of attacking it--nay, in his struggle with it he roused
   himself to a state of holy indignation--of exposing its wolfish nature
   and hypocrisy, and of declaring that its day of judgment was at hand.
   In whatever domain it had any warrant to act, he accepted it: "Go and
   show yourselves unto the priests." So far as they really proclaimed
   God's law he recognised them: "Whatever they tell you to do, that do."
   But these were the people to whom he read the terrible lecture given in
   Matthew xxiii.: "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for
   ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
   outward, but are within full of dead men's bones and of all
   uncleanness." Towards these spiritual "authorities," then, he filled
   his disciples with a holy want of respect, and even of "King" Herod he
   spoke with bitter irony: "Go ye and tell that fox." On the other hand,
   so far as we can judge from the scanty evidence before us, his attitude
   towards the real authorities, those who wielded the sword, was
   different. He recognised that they had an actual right to be obeyed,
   and he never withdrew his own person from their jurisdiction. Nor are
   we to understand the commandment against swearing as including an oath
   taken before a magistrate. No one with a grain of salt, as Wellhausen
   has rightly said, can miss the inner meaning of this commandment. On
   the other hand, we must be careful not to rate Jesus' position in
   regard to constituted authority too high. People usually appeal to the
   often quoted saying: "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's
   and unto God the things that are God's." But this saying is often
   misunderstood. Wherever it is explained as meaning that Jesus
   recognised God and Caesar as the two powers which in some way or other
   exist side by side, or are even in secret alliance, it is taken in a
   wrong sense. Jesus had no such thought; on the contrary, he spoke of
   the two powers as separate and divorced from each other. God and Caesar
   are the lords of two quite different provinces. Jesus settled the
   question that was in dispute by pointing out this difference, which is
   so great that no conflict between the powers can arise. The penny is an
   earthly coin and bears Caesar's image; let it be given, then, to
   Caesar, but--this we may take as the complement--the soul and all its
   powers have nothing to do with Caesar; they belong to God. In a word,
   the all-important matter, in Jesus' view, is not to mix up the two
   provinces. When we are once quite clear about this, then we may go on
   to remark on the significance of the fact that Jesus enjoined
   compliance with the demand for payment of the imperial taxes. No doubt
   it is important to note that he himself respected the constituted
   authorities, and wished to see them respected; but in regard to the
   estimate which he formed of them, what he said is, at the least, of a
   neutral character.

   On the other hand, we possess another saying of Jesus in regard to
   constituted authority which is much less often quoted, and nevertheless
   affords us a deeper insight into the Lord's thoughts than the one which
   we have just discussed. Let us consider it for a moment. The fact that
   it forms a point of transition to the consideration of the attitude
   which Jesus took up in regard to legal regulations in general also
   makes it worth our attention. In Mark x. 42, we read:

   Jesus called them (i. e., his disciples) to him and saith unto them, Ye
   know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise
   lordship over them: and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
   But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever shall be great among
   you shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest
   shall be servant of all.

   Observe here, first of all, the "transvaluation of values." Jesus
   simply reverses the usual process: to be great and to occupy the
   foremost position means, in his view, to serve; his disciples are to
   aim, not at ruling, but at each being all other men's servant. Next
   observe the opinion which he has of authority as it was then
   constituted. Their functions are based on force, and this is the very
   reason which, in Jesus' view, puts them outside the moral sphere; nay,
   there is a fundamental opposition between it and them: "Thus do the
   earthly rulers." Jesus tells his disciples to act differently. Law and
   legal ordinance, as resting on force only, on actual power and its
   exercise, have no moral value. Nevertheless Jesus did not command men
   not to subject themselves to these authorities; they were to rate them
   according to their value, that is, according to their non-value, and
   they were to arrange their own lives on other principles, namely, on
   the opposite; they were not to use force, but to serve. Here we have
   already passed to the general ground of legal ordinance, for it seems
   to be an essential feature of all law to secure observance by force
   when called in question.

   When we approach the second point, the relation of the Gospel to legal
   ordinance generally, we again encounter two different views. One of
   them--in modern times more particularly maintained, in his treatise on
   Canon Law, by Professor Sohm of Leipzig, who presents points of contact
   with Tolstoi--lays down that in their respective natures law and the
   world of spiritual things are diametrically opposed; and that it is in
   contradiction with the character of the Gospel and the community
   founded thereon that the Church has developed any legal ordinances at
   all. In his survey of the earliest development of the Church Professor
   Sohm has gone so far as to see in the moment when Christendom gave a
   place in its midst to legal ordinances a second Fall. Nevertheless he
   is unwilling to impugn the law in its own province. But Tolstoi
   refuses, in the name of the Gospel, to allow the law any rights at all.
   He maintains that the leading principle of the Gospel is that a man is
   never to insist upon his rights, and that not even constituted
   authority is to offer any external resistance to evil. Authority and
   law are simply to cease. Opposed to Tolstoi there are others who more
   or less positively contend that the Gospel takes law and legal
   relations under its protection; that it sanctifies them and thereby
   raises them into a divine sphere. These are, briefly, the two leading
   points of view which are here in conflict.

   As regards the latter, there is little that need be said. It is a
   mockery of the Gospel to say that it protects and sanctifies everything
   that presents itself as law and legal relation at a given moment.
   Leaving a thing alone and bearing with it are not the same as
   sanctioning and preserving it. Nay, it is a serious question whether
   even bearing with it is not too much to say, and whether Tolstoi is not
   right. The difficulty of the matter makes it necessary that I should
   take you back a little way in Jewish history.

   For hundreds of years the poor and oppressed in the people of Israel
   had been crying out for justice. It was a cry which still affects us
   to-day as we hear it in the words of the prophets and out of the
   prayers of the Psalmists; but time after time it passed unheeded. None
   of the legal regulations in force was free from the power of tyrannical
   authorities, to be distorted and exploited by them just as they saw
   fit. In speaking of legal regulations and their exercise, and in
   examining Jesus' attitude towards them, we must not straightway think
   of our own legal relations, which have grown up partly on the basis of
   Christianity. Jesus was of a nation the greater part of which had for
   generations been in vain asking for their rights, and which was
   familiar with law only in the form of force. The necessary consequence
   was that in such a nation a feeling of despair arose in regard to the
   law; despair, as much of the possibility of ever getting justice on
   earth as, conversely, of the moral claim of law to have any validity at
   all. We can see something of this temper even in the Gospel. But there
   is a second consideration which is a standing corrective to this
   temper. Jesus, like all truly religious minds, was firmly convinced
   that in the end God will do justice. If He does not do it here, He will
   do it in the Beyond, and that is the main point. In this connexion
   there was, in Jesus' view, nothing objectionable in the idea of law in
   the sense of a just recompense; it was a lofty, nay, a dominating idea.
   Just recompense is the function of God's majesty; to what extent it is
   modified by His mercy is a question which we need not here consider.
   The contention that Jesus took a depreciatory view of law as such, and
   of the exercise of law, cannot be sustained for a moment. On the
   contrary, everyone is to get his rights; nay more, his disciples are
   one day to share in administering God's justice and themselves judge.
   It was only the justice which was exercised with violence and therefore
   unjustly, the justice which lay upon the nation like a tyrannical and
   bloody decree, that he set aside. He believed in true justice, and he
   was certain, too, that it would prevail; so certain, that he did not
   think it necessary for justice to use force in order to remain justice.

   This brings us to the last point. We possess a number of Jesus' sayings
   in which he directs his disciples to renounce all their lawful demands,
   and so forego their just rights. You all know those sayings. Let me
   remind you of one only: "But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil,
   but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
   other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
   coat, let him have thy cloak also." The demand here made seems to
   proscribe law and disorganise all the legal relations of life. Again
   and again these words have been appealed to with the object of showing
   either that Christianity is incompatible with life as it actually is,
   or that Christendom has fallen away from the principles of its Master.
   By way of reply to this argument the following observations may be
   made:--(i.) Jesus was, as we have seen, steeped in the conviction that
   God does justice; in the end, therefore, the oppressor will not
   prevail, but the oppressed will get his rights. (ii.) Earthly rights
   are in themselves of little account, and it does not much matter if we
   lose them. (iii.) The world is in such an unhappy state, injustice has
   got so much the upper hand in it, that the victim of oppression is
   incapable of making good his rights even if he tries. (iv.) As God
   --and this is the main point--mingles His justice with mercy, and lets
   His sun shine on the just and on the unjust, so Jesus' disciple is to
   show love to his enemies and disarm them by gentleness. Such are the
   thoughts which underlie those lofty sayings and at the same time set
   them their due limits. And is the demand which they contain really so
   supramundane, so impossible? Do we not in the circle of our family and
   friends advise those who belong to us to act in the same way, and not
   to return evil for evil and abuse for abuse? What family, what society,
   could continue to exist, if every member of it were anxious only to
   pursue his own rights, and did not learn to renounce them even when
   attacked? Jesus regards his disciples as a circle of friends, and he
   looks out beyond this circle to a league of brothers which will take
   shape in the future and extend. But, we are asked, are we in all cases
   to renounce the pursuit of our rights in the face of our enemies? are
   we to use no weapons but those of gentleness? To speak with Tolstoi,
   are the magistrates not to inflict punishment, and thereby to be
   effaced? are nations not to fight for house and home when they are
   wantonly attacked? I venture to maintain that, when Jesus spoke the
   words which I have quoted, he was not thinking of such cases, and that
   to interpret them in this direction involves a clumsy and dangerous
   misconception of their meaning. Jesus never had anyone but the
   individual in mind, and the abiding disposition of the heart in love.
   To say that this disposition cannot coexist with the pursuit of one's
   own rights, with the conscientious administration of justice, and with
   the stern punishment of crime, is a piece of prejudice, in support of
   which we may appeal in vain to the letter of those sayings, which did
   not aim at being laws or, therefore, at prescribing regulations. This
   much, however, must be added, in order that the loftiness of the demand
   which the Gospel makes may be in no way abated: Jesus' disciple ought
   to be able to renounce the pursuit of his rights, and ought to
   co-operate in forming a nation of brothers, in which justice is done,
   no longer by the aid of force, but by free obedience to the good, and
   which is united not by legal regulations but by the ministry of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE VII

   WE were occupied in the last lecture with the relation of the Gospel to
   law and legal ordinance. We saw that Jesus was convinced that God does,
   and will do, justice. We saw, further, that he demanded of his
   disciples that they should be able to renounce their rights. In giving
   expression to this demand, far from having all the circumstances of his
   own time in mind, still less the more complex conditions of a later
   age, he has one and one only present to his soul, namely, the relation
   of every man to the kingdom of God. Because a man is to sell all that
   he has in order to buy the pearl of great price, so he must also be
   able to abandon his earthly rights and subordinate everything to that
   highest relation. But in connexion with this message of his, Jesus
   opens up to us the prospect of a union among men, which is held
   together not by any legal ordinance, but by the rule of love, and where
   a man conquers his enemy by gentleness. It is a high and glorious
   ideal, and we have received it from the very foundation of our
   religion. It ought to float before our eyes as the goal and guiding
   star of our historical development. Whether mankind will ever attain to
   it, who can say? but we can and ought to approximate to it, and in
   these days--otherwise than two or three hundred years ago--we feel a
   moral obligation in this direction. Those of us who possess more
   delicate and therefore more prophetic perceptions no longer regard the
   kingdom of love and peace as a mere Utopia.

   But for this very reason there are many among us to-day upon whom a
   very serious and difficult question presses with redoubled force. We
   see a whole class struggling for its rights; or, rather, we see it
   struggling to extend and increase its rights. Is that compatible with
   the Christian temper? Does not the Gospel forbid such a struggle? Have
   we not been told that we are to renounce the rights we have, to say
   nothing of trying to get more? Must we, then, as Christians, recall the
   labouring classes from the struggle for their rights, and exhort them
   only to patience and submission?

   The problem with which we have here to do is also stated more or less
   in the form of an accusation against Christianity. Earnest men in
   political circles of a socialistic tendency, who would gladly be guided
   by Jesus Christ, complain that in this matter the Gospel leaves them in
   the lurch. They say that it imposes restraint upon aspirations which
   with a clear conscience they feel to be justified; that in requiring
   absolute meekness and submission it disarms everyone who wants to
   fight; that it narcotises, as it were, all real energy. Some say this
   with pain and regret, others with satisfaction. The latter assert that
   they always knew that the Gospel was not for the healthy and the
   strong, but for the broken-down; that it knows, and wants to know,
   nothing of the fact that life, and especially modern life, is a
   struggle, a struggle for one's own rights. What answer are we to give
   them?

   My own opinion is that these statements and complaints are made by
   people who have never yet clearly realised with what it is that the
   Gospel has to do, and who rashly and improperly connect it with earthly
   things. The Gospel makes its appeal to the inner man, who, whether he
   is well or wounded, in a happy position or a miserable, obliged to
   spend his earthly life fighting or quietly maintaining what he has won,
   always remains the same. "My kingdom is not of this world"; it is no
   earthly kingdom that the Gospel establishes. These words not only
   exclude such a political theocracy as the Pope aims at setting up, and
   all worldly dominion; they have a much wider range. Negatively they
   forbid all direct and formal interference of religion in worldly
   affairs. Positively what the Gospel says is this: Whoever you may be,
   and whatever your position, whether bondman or free, whether fighting
   or at rest--your real task in life is always the same. There is only
   one relation and one idea which you must not violate, and in the face
   of which all others are only transient wrappings and vain show: to be a
   child of God and a citizen of His kingdom, and to exercise love. How
   you are to maintain yourself in this life on earth, and in what way you
   are to serve your neighbour, is left to you and your own liberty of
   action. This is what the apostle Paul understood by the Gospel, and I
   do not believe that he misunderstood it. Then let us fight, let us
   struggle, let us get justice for the oppressed, let us order the
   circumstances of the world as we with a clear conscience can, and as we
   may think best for our neighbour; but do not let us expect the Gospel
   to afford us any direct help; let us make no selfish demands for
   ourselves; and let us not forget that the world passes away, not only
   with the lusts thereof, but also with its regulations and its goods!
   Once more be it said: the Gospel knows only one goal, one idea; and it
   demands of a man that he shall never put them aside. If the exhortation
   to renounce takes, in a harsh and one-sided way, a foremost place in
   Jesus' words, we must be careful to keep before our eyes the paramount
   and exclusive claims of the relation to God and the idea of love. The
   Gospel is above all questions of mundane development; it is concerned,
   not with material things but with the souls of men.

   With this we have already passed to the next question which was to
   occupy our attention, and we have half answered it.

   (4) The Gospel and work, or the question of civilisation.

   The points which we shall have to consider here are essentially the
   same as those which we emphasised in regard to the question just
   discussed; and we shall therefore be able to proceed more concisely.

   Jesus' teaching has been felt again and again, but above all in our own
   day, to exhibit no interest in any systematic work or calling, and no
   appreciation of those ideal possessions which go by the name of Art and
   Science. Nowhere, people say, does Jesus summon men to labour and to
   put their hands to the work of progress; in vain shall we look in his
   words for any expression of pleasure in vigorous activity; these ideal
   possessions lay far beyond his field of vision. In that last, unhappy
   book of his, The Old Faith and the New, David Friedrich Strauss gave
   particularly harsh expression to this feeling. He speaks of a
   fundamental defect in the Gospel, which he considers antiquated and
   useless because out of sympathy with the progress of civilisation. But
   long before Strauss the Pietistic movement exhibited the same sort of
   feeling. The Pietists tried to evade the difficulty in a way of their
   own. They started from the position that Jesus must be able to serve as
   a direct example for all men, whatever their calling; that he must have
   proved himself in all the situations in which a man can be placed. They
   admitted that a cursory examination of Jesus' life disclosed the fact
   that this requirement was not fulfilled; but they were of opinion that
   on a closer inspection it would be found that he was really the best
   bricklayer, the best tailor, the best judge, the best scholar, and so
   on, and that he had the best knowledge and understanding for
   everything. They turned and twisted what Jesus said and did until it
   was made to express and corroborate what they wanted. Although it was a
   childish attempt which they made, the problem of which they were
   sensible was nevertheless of some moment. They felt that their
   consciences and their callings bound them to a definite activity and a
   definite business; they were clear that they ought not to become monks;
   and yet they were anxious, to practise the imitation of Christ in the
   full sense. They felt, then, that he must have stood in the same
   situation as they themselves, and that his horizon must have been the
   same as theirs.

   Here we have the same case as we dealt with in the last section, only
   covering a wider. field. It is the ancient and constantly recurring
   error, that the Gospel has to do with the affairs of the world, and
   that it is its business to prescribe how they are to be carried on.
   Here, too, the old and almost ineradicable tendency of mankind to rid
   itself of its freedom and responsibility in higher things and subject
   itself to a law, comes into play. It is much easier, in fact, to resign
   oneself to any, even the sternest, kind of authority, than to live in
   the liberty of the good. But, apart from this, the question remains: Is
   it not a real defect in the Gospel that it betrays so little sympathy
   with the business of life, and is out of touch with the humaniora in
   the sense of science, art, and civilisation generally?

   I answer, in the first place: What would have been gained if it had not
   possessed this "defect"? Suppose that it had taken an active interest
   in all those efforts, would it not have become entangled in them, or,
   at any rate, have incurred the risk of appearing to be so entangled?
   Labour, art, science, the progress of civilisation--these are not
   things which exist in the abstract; they exist in the particular phase
   of an age. The Gospel, then, would have hafl to ally itself with them.
   But phases change. In the Roman Church of to-day we see how heavily
   religion is burdened by being connected with a particular epoch of
   civilisation. In the Middle Ages this Church, anxious to participate to
   the full in all questions of progress and civilisation, gave them form
   and shape, and laid down their laws. Insensibly, however, the Church
   identified its sacred inheritance and its peculiar mission with the
   knowledge, the maxims, and the interests which it then acquired; so
   that it is now, as it were, firmly pinned down to the philosophy, the
   political economy, in short, to the whole civilisation, of the Middle
   Ages. On the other hand, what a service the Gospel has rendered to
   mankind by having sounded the notes of religion in mighty chords and
   banished every other melody!

   In the second place, labour and the progress of civilisation are, no
   doubt, very precious, and summon us to strenuous exertion. But they do
   not comprise the highest ideal. They are incapable of filling the soul
   with real satisfaction. Although work may give pleasure, that is only
   one aspect of the matter. I have always found that the people who talk
   loudest about the pleasure which work affords make no very great
   efforts themselves; whilst those who are uninterruptedly engaged in
   heavy labour are hesitating in its praises. As a matter of fact, there
   is a great deal of hypocritical twaddle talked about work.
   Three-fourths of it and more is nothing but stupefying toil, and the
   man who really works hard shares the poet's aspirations as he looks
   forward to evening:

   Head, hands and feet rejoice: the work is done.

   And then, think of the results of all this labour! When a man has done
   a piece of work, he would like to do it over again, and the knowledge
   of its defects falls heavily on soul and conscience. No! it is not in
   so far as we work that we live, but in so far as we rejoice in the love
   of others, and ourselves exercise love. Faust is right: Labour which is
   labour and nothing else becomes an aversion. We long for the streams of
   living water, and for the spring itself from which those waters flow:

   Man sehnt sich nach des Lebens Bächen,
   Ach! nach des Lebens Quelle hin.

   Labour is a valuable safety-valve and useful in keeping off greater
   ills, but it is not in itself an absolute good, and we cannot include
   it amongst our ideals. The same may be said of the progress of
   civilisation. It is, of course, to be welcomed; but the piece of
   progress in which we delight to-day becomes something mechanical by
   to-morrow, and leaves us cold. The man of any deep feeling will
   thankfully receive anything that the development of progress may bring
   him; but he knows very well that his situation inwardly--the problems
   that agitate him and the fundamental position in which he stands--is
   not essentially, nay, is scarcely even unessentially, altered by it
   all. It is only for a moment that it seems as if something new were
   coming, and a man were being really relieved of his burden. Gentlemen,
   when a man grows older and sees more deeply into life, he does not
   find, if he possesses any inner world at all, that he is advanced by
   the external march of things, by "the progress of civilisation." Nay,
   he feels himself, rather, where he was before, and forced to seek the
   sources of strength which his forefathers also sought. He is forced to
   make himself a native of the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the
   Eternal, the kingdom of Love; and he comes to understand that it was
   only of this kingdom that Jesus Christ desired to speak and to testify,
   and he is grateful to him for it.

   But, in the third place, Jesus had a strong and positive conviction of
   the aggressive and forward character of his message. "I am come to send
   fire on the earth, and"--he added--"what will I if it be already
   kindled?" The fire of the judgment and the forces of love were what he
   wanted to summon up, so as to create a new humanity. If he spoke of
   these forces of love in the simple manner corresponding to the
   conditions nearest at hand--the feeding of the hungry, the clothing of
   the naked, the visiting of the sick and those in prison--it is
   nevertheless clear that a great inward transformation of the humanity
   which he saw in the mirror of the little nation in Palestine hovered
   before his eyes: "One is your master, and all ye are brethren." The
   last hour is come; but in the last hour from a small seed a tree is to
   grow up which shall spread its branches far and wide. Further, he was
   revealing the knowledge of God, and he was certain that it would ripen
   the young, strengthen the weak, and make them God's champions.
   Knowledge of God is the spring that is to fructify the barren field,
   and pour forth streams of living water. In this sense he spoke of it as
   the highest and the only necessary good, as the condition of all
   edification, and, we may also say, of all true growth and progress.
   Lastly, he saw on his horizon not only the judgment, but also a kingdom
   of justice, of love, and of peace, which, though it came from heaven,
   was nevertheless for this earth. When it is to come, he himself knows
   not--the hour is known to the Father only; but he knows how and by what
   means it will spread; and side by side with the highly coloured,
   dramatic pictures which pass through his soul there are quiet
   perceptions which are fixed and steady. He sees the vineyard of God on
   this earth and God calling His labourers into it--happy the man who
   receives a call! They labour in the vineyard, stand no longer idle in
   the marketplace, and at last receive their reward. Or take the parable
   of the talents distributed in order to be employed, and therefore not
   to be buried in a napkin. A day's work, labour, increase, progress--he
   sees it all, but placed at the service of God and neighbour, encircled
   by the light of the Eternal, and removed from the service of transient
   things.

   To sum up what we have here tried to indicate: Is the complaint from
   which we started at the beginning of this section justified? Ought we
   really to desire that the Gospel had adapted itself to "the progress of
   civilisation"? Here, too, I think, we have to learn from the Gospel and
   not to find fault with it. It tells us of the real work which humanity
   has to accomplish, and we ought not to meet its message by entrenching
   ourselves behind our miserable "work of civilisation." "The image of
   Christ," as a modern historian justly says, "remains the sole basis of
   all moral culture, and in the measure in which it succeeds in making
   its light penetrate is the moral culture of the nations increased or
   diminished."

   (5) The Gospel and the Son of God, or the
   Christological question.

   We now pass from the sphere of questions of which we have been treating
   hitherto. The four previous questions are all intimately connected with
   one another. Failure to answer them rightly always proceeds from not
   rating the Gospel high enough; from somehow or other dragging it down
   to the level of mundane questions and entangling it in them. Or, to put
   the matter differently: The forces of the Gospel appeal to the deepest
   foundations of human existence and to them only; it is there alone that
   their leverage is applied. If a man is unable, then, to go down to the
   root of humanity, and has no feeling for it and no knowledge of it, he
   will fail to understand the Gospel, and will then try to profane it or
   else complain that it is of no use.

   We now, however, approach quite a different problem: What position did
   Jesus himself take up towards the Gospel while he was proclaiming it,
   and how did he wish himself to be accepted? We are not yet dealing with
   the way in which his disciples accepted him, or the place which they
   gave him in their hearts, and the opinion which they formed of him; we
   are now speaking only of his own testimony of himself. But the question
   is one which lands us in the great sphere of controverted questions
   which cover the history of the Church from the first century up to our
   own time. In the course of this controversy men put an end to brotherly
   fellowship for the sake of a nuance; and thousands were cast out,
   condemned, loaded with chains and done to death. It is a gruesome
   story. On the question of "Christology" men beat their religious
   doctrines into terrible weapons, and spread fear and intimidation
   everywhere. This attitude still continues: Christology is treated as
   though the Gospel had no other problem to offer, and the accompanying
   fanaticism is still rampant in our own day. Who can wonder at the
   difficulty of the problem, weighed down as it is with such a burden of
   history and made the sport of parties? Yet anyone who will look at our
   Gospels with unprejudiced eyes will not find that the question of
   Jesus' own testimony is insoluble. So much of it, however, as remains
   obscure and mysterious to our minds ought to remain so; as Jesus meant
   it to be, and as, in the very nature of the problem, it is. It is only
   in pictures that we can give it expression. "There are phenomena which
   cannot, without the aid of symbols, be brought within the range of the
   understanding."

   Before we examine Jesus' own testimony about himself, two leading
   points must be established. In the first place, he desired no other
   belief in his `person and no other attachment to it than is contained
   in the keeping of his commandments Even in the fourth Gospel, in which
   Jesus' person often seems to be raised above the contents of the
   Gospel, the idea is still clearly formulated: "If ye love me, keep my
   commandments." He must himself have found, during his labours, that
   some people honoured, nay, even trusted him, without troubling
   themselves about the contents of his message. It was to them that he
   addressed the reprimand: "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
   shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven; but he that doeth the will of
   my Father." To lay down any "doctrine" about his person and his dignity
   independently of the Gospel was, then, quite outside his sphere of
   ideas. In the second place, he described the Lord of heaven and earth
   as his God and his Father; as the Greater, and as Him who is alone
   good. He is certain that everything which he has and everything which
   he is to accomplish comes from this Father. He prays to Him; he
   subjects himself to His will; he struggles hard to find out what it is
   and to fulfil it. Aim, strength, understanding, the issue, and the hard
   must, all come from the Father. This is what the Gospels say, and it
   cannot be turned and twisted. This feeling, praying, working,
   struggling, and suffering individual is a man who in the face of his
   God also associates himself with other men.

   These two facts mark out, as it were, the boundaries of the ground
   covered by Jesus' testimony of himself. They do not, it is true, give
   us any positive information as to what he said; but we shall understand
   what he really meant by his testimony if we look closely at the two
   descriptions which he gave of himself: the Son of God and the Messiah
   (the Son of David, the Son of Man).

   The description of himself as the Son of God, Messianic though it may
   have been in its original conception, lies very much nearer to our
   modern way of thinking than the other, for Jesus himself gave a meaning
   to this conception which almost takes it out of the class of Messianic
   ideas, or at all events does not make its inclusion in that class
   necessary to a proper understanding of it. On the other hand, if we do
   not desire to be put off with a lifeless word, the description of
   himself as the Messiah is at first blush one that is quite foreign to
   our ideas. Without some explanation we cannot understand, nay, unless
   we are Jews, we cannot understand at all, what this post of honour
   means and what rank and character it possesses. It is only when we have
   ascertained its meaning by historical research that we can ask whether
   the word has a significance which in any way survives the destruction
   of the husk in which it took shape in Jewish political life.

   Let us first of all consider the designation, "Son of God." Jesus in
   one of his discourses made it specially clear why and in what sense he
   gave himself this name. The saying is to be found in Matthew, and not,
   as might perhaps have been expected, in John: "No man knoweth the Son
   but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and
   he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him." It is "knowledge of God"
   that makes the sphere of the Divine Sonship. It is in this knowledge
   that he came. to know the sacred Being who rules heaven and earth as
   Father, as his Father. The consciousness which he possessed of being
   the Son of God is, therefore, nothing but the practical consequence of
   knowing God as the Father and as his Father. Rightly understood, the
   name of Son means nothing but the knowledge of God. Here, however, two
   observations are to be made: Jesus is convinced that he knows God in a
   way in which no one ever knew Him before, and he knows that it is his
   vocation to communicate this knowledge of God to others by word and by
   deed--and with it the knowledge that men are God's children. In this
   consciousness he knows himself to be the Son called and instituted of
   God, to be the Son of God, and hence he can say: My God and my Father,
   and into this invocation he puts something which belongs to no one but
   himself. How he came to this consciousness of the unique character of
   his relation to God as a Son; how he came to the consciousness of his
   power, and to the consciousness of the obligation and the mission which
   this power carries with it, is his secret, and no psychology will ever
   fathom it. The confidence with which John makes him address the Father:
   "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" is undoubtedly the
   direct reflection of the certainty with which Jesus himself spoke. Here
   all research must stop. We are not even able to say when it was that he
   first knew himself as the Son, and whether he at once completely
   identified himself with this idea and let his individuality be absorbed
   in it, or whether it formed an inner problem which kept him in constant
   suspense. No one could fathom this mystery who had not had a parallel
   experience. A prophet may, if he chooses, try to raise the veil, but,
   for our part, we must be content with the fact that this Jesus who
   preached humility and knowledge of self, nevertheless named himself and
   himself alone as the Son of God. He is certain that he knows the
   Father, that he is to bring this knowledge to all men, and that thereby
   he is doing the work of God. Among all the works of God this is the
   greatest; it is the aim and end of all creation. The work is given to
   him to do, and in God's strength he will accomplish it. It was out of
   this feeling of power and in the prospect of victory that he uttered
   the words: "The Father hath committed all things unto me." Again and
   again in the history of mankind men of God have come forward in the
   sure consciousness of possessing a divine message, and of being
   compelled, whether they will or not, to deliver it. But the message has
   always happened to be imperfect; in this spot or that, defective; bound
   up with political or particularistic elements; designed to meet the
   circumstances of the moment; and very often the prophet did not stand
   the test of being himself an example of his message. But in this case
   the message brought was of the profoundest and most comprehensive
   character; it went to the very root of mankind and, although set in the
   framework of the Jewish nation, it addressed itself to the whole of
   humanity--the message from God the Father. Defective it is not, and its
   real kernel may be readily freed from the inevitable husk of
   contemporary form. Antiquated nit is not, and in life and strength it
   still triumphs to-day over all the past. He who delivered it has as yet
   yielded his place to no man, and to human life he still to-day gives a
   meaning and an aim--he the Son of God.

   This already brings us to the other designation which Jesus gave of
   himself: the Messiah. Before I attempt briefly to explain it, I ought
   to mention that some scholars of note--and among them Wellhausen--have
   expressed a doubt whether Jesus described himself as the Messiah. In
   that doubt I cannot concur; nay, I think that it is only by wrenching
   what the evangelists tell us off its hinges that the opinion can be
   maintained. The very expression "Son of Man"--that Jesus used it is
   beyond question seems to me to be intelligible only in a Messianic
   sense. To say nothing of anything else, such a story as that of
   Christ's entry into Jerusalem would have to be simply expunged, if the
   theory is to be maintained that he did not consider himself the
   promised Messiah and also desire to be accepted as such. Moreover, the
   forms in which Jesus expressed what he felt about his own consciousness
   and his vocation become quite incomprehensible unless they are taken as
   the outcome of the Messianic idea. Finally, the positive arguments
   which are advanced in support of the theory are either so very weak, or
   else so highly questionable, that we may remain quite sure that Jesus
   called himself the Messiah.

   The idea of a Messiah and the Messianic notions generally, as they
   existed in Jesus' day, had been developed on two combined lines, on the
   line of the kings and on that of the prophets. Alien influences had
   also been at work, and the whole idea was transfigured by the ancient
   expectation that God Himself in visible form would take up the
   government of His people. The leading features of the Messianic idea
   were taken from the Israelitish kingdom in the ideal splendour in which
   it was invested after the kingdom itself had disappeared. Memories of
   Moses and of the great prophets also played a part in it. In the
   following lecture we shall briefly show what shapes the Messianic hopes
   had assumed up to Jesus' time, and in what way he took them up and
   transformed them.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE VIII

   ALTHOUGH the Messianic doctrines prevalent in the Jewish nation in
   Jesus' day were not a positive "dogma," and had no connexion with the
   legal precepts which were so rigidly cultivated, they formed an
   essential element of the hopes, religious and political, which the
   nation entertained for the future. They were of no very definite
   character, except in certain fundamental features; beyond these the
   greatest differences prevailed. The old prophets had looked forth to a
   glorious future in which God would Himself come down, destroy the
   enemies of Israel, and work justice, peace, and joy. At the same time,
   however, they had also promised that a wise and mighty king of the
   house of David would appear and bring this glorious state of things to
   pass. They had ended by indicating the people of Israel itself as the
   Son of God, chosen from amongst the nations of the world. These three
   views exercised a determining influence in the subsequent elaboration
   of the Messianic ideas. The hope of a glorious future for the people of
   Israel remained the frame into which all expectations were fitted, but
   in the two centuries before Christ the following factors were added:
   (i.) The extension of their historical horizon strengthened the
   interest of the Jews in the nations of the world, introduced the notion
   of "mankind" as a whole, and brought it within the sphere of the
   expected end, including, therefore, the operations of the Messiah. The
   day of judgment is regarded as extending to the whole world, and the
   Messiah not only as judging the world but as ruling it as well. (ii.)
   In early times, although the moral purification of the people had been
   thought of in connexion with the glorious future, the destruction of
   Israel's enemies seemed to be the main consideration; but now the
   feeling of moral responsibility and the knowledge of God as the Holy
   One became more active; the view prevails that the Messianic age
   demands a holy people, and that the judgment to come must of necessity
   also be a judgment upon a part of Israel itself. (iii.) As
   individualism became a stronger force, so the relation of God to the
   individual was prominently emphasised. The individual Israelite comes
   to feel that he is in the midst of his people, and he begins to look
   upon it as a sum of individuals; the individual belief in Providence
   appears side by side with the political belief, and combines with the
   feeling of personal worth and responsibility; and in connexion with the
   expectation of the end, we get the first dawn of the hope of an eternal
   life and the fear of eternal punishment. The products of this inner
   development are an interest in personal salvation, and a belief in the
   resurrection; and the roused conscience is no longer able to hope for a
   glorious future for all in view of the open profanity of the people and
   the power of sin; only a remnant will be saved. (iv.) The expectations
   for the future become more and more transcendent; they are increasingly
   shifted to the realm of the supernatural and the supramundane;
   something quite new comes down from heaven to earth, and the new course
   on which the world enters severs it from the old; nay, this earth,
   transfigured as it will be, is no longer the final goal; the idea of an
   absolute bliss arises, whose abode can only be heaven itself. (v.) The
   personality of the long-expected Messiah is sharply distinguished, as
   well from the idea of an earthly king as from the idea of the people as
   a whole, and from the idea of God. Although he appears as a man amongst
   men, the Messiah retains scarcely any Messianic traits. He is
   represented as with God from. the first beginnings of time; he comes
   down from heaven, and accomplishes his work by superhuman means; the
   moral traits in the picture formed of him come into prominence; he is
   the perfectly just man who fulfils all the commandments. Nay, the idea
   that others benefit by his merits forces its way in. The notion,
   however, of a suffering Messiah, which might seem to be suggested by
   Isaiah liii., is not reached.

   But none of these speculations succeeded in displacing the older and
   simpler conceptions, or in banishing that original, patriotic, and
   political interpretation of them with which the great majority of the
   people were familiar. God Himself assuming the sceptre, destroying His
   enemies, founding the Israelitish kingdom of the world, and availing
   Himself of a kingly champion for the purpose; every man sitting under
   his own fig-tree, in his own vineyard, enjoying the fruits of peace,
   with his foot upon the neck of his enemies--that was, after all, still
   the most popular conception of the coming of the Messiah, and it was
   fixed in the minds even of those who were at the same time attracted to
   higher views. But a portion of the people had undoubtedly awakened to
   the feeling that the kingdom of God presupposes a moral condition of a
   corresponding character, and that it could come only to a righteous
   people. Some looked to acquiring this righteousness by means of a
   punctilious observance of the law, and no zeal that they could show for
   it was enough; others, under the influences of a deeper self-knowledge,
   began to have a dim idea that the righteousness which they so ardently
   desired could itself come only from the hand of God, and that in order
   to shake off the burden of sin--for they had begun to be tortured by an
   inner sense of it--divine assistance, and divine grace and mercy, were
   needful.

   Thus in Christ's time there was a surging chaos of disparate feeling,
   as well as of contradictory theory, in regard to this one matter. At no
   other time, perhaps, in the history of religion, and in no other
   people, were the most extreme antitheses so closely associated under
   the binding influence of religion. At one moment the horizon seems as
   narrow as the circle of the hills which surround Jerusalem; at another
   it embraces all mankind. Here everything is put upon a high plane and
   regarded from the spiritual and moral point of view; and there, at but
   a stone's throw, the whole drama seems as though it must close with a
   political victory for the nation. In one group all the forces of divine
   trust and confidence are disengaged, and the upright man struggles
   through to a solemn "Nevertheless"; in another, every religious impulse
   is stifled by a morally obtuse, patriotic fanaticism.

   The idea which was formed of the Messiah must have been as
   contradictory as the hopes to which it was meant to respond. Not only
   were people's formal notions about him continually changing--questions
   were being raised, for instance, as to the sort of bodily nature which
   he would have; above all, his inmost character and the work to which he
   was to be called appeared in diverse lights. But wherever the moral and
   really religious elements had begun to get the upper hand, people were
   forced to abandon the image of the political and warlike ruler, and let
   that of the prophet, which had always to some extent helped to form the
   general notions about the Messiah, take its place. That he would bring
   God near; that somehow or other he would do justice; that he would
   deliver from the burden of torment within--this was what was hoped of
   him. The story of John the Baptist as related in our Gospels makes it
   clear that there were devout men in the Jewish nation at that time who
   were expecting a Messiah in this form, or at least did not absolutely
   reject the idea. We learn from that story that some were disposed to
   take John for the Messiah. What elasticity the Messianic ideas must
   have possessed, and how far, in certain circles, they must have
   travelled from the form which they originally assumed, when this very
   unkinglike preacher of repentance, clad in a garment of camel's hair,
   and with no message but that the nation had degenerated and its day of
   judgment was at hand, could be taken for the Messiah himself! And when
   the Gospels go on to tell us that not a few among the people took Jesus
   for the Messiah only because he taught as one with authority, and
   worked miraculous cures, how fundamentally the idea of the Messiah
   seems to be changed! They regarded this saving activity, it is true,
   only as the beginning of his mission; they expected that the
   wonder-worker would presently throw off his disguise and "set up the
   kingdom"; but all that we are concerned with here is that they were
   capable of welcoming as the promised one a man whose origin and
   previous life they knew, and who had as yet done nothing but preach
   repentance and proclaim that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. We
   shall never fathom the inward development by which Jesus passed from
   the assurance that he was the Son of God to the other assurance that he
   was the promised Messiah. But when we see that the idea which others as
   well had formed of the Messiah at that time had, by a slow process of
   change, developed entirely new features, and had passed from a
   political and religious idea into a spiritual and religious one--when
   we see this, the problem no longer wears a character of complete
   isolation. That John the Baptist and the twelve disciples acknowledged
   Jesus to be the Messiah; that the positive estimate which they formed
   of his person did not lead them to reject the shape in which he
   appeared, but, on the contrary, was fixed in this very shape, is a
   proof of the flexible character of the Messianic idea at the time, and
   also explains how it was that Jesus could himself adopt it. "Strength
   is made perfect in weakness." That there is a divine strength and glory
   which stands in no need of earthly power and earthly splendour, nay,
   excludes them; that there is a majesty of holiness and love which saves
   and blesses those upon whom it lays hold, was what he knew who in spite
   of his lowliness called himself the Messiah, and the same must have
   been felt by those who recognised him as the king of Israel anointed of
   God.

   How Jesus arrived at the consciousness of being the Messiah we cannot
   explain, but still there are some points connected with the question
   which can be established. An inner event which Jesus experienced at his
   baptism was, in the view of the oldest tradition, the foundation of his
   Messianic consciousness. It is not an experience which is subject to
   any criticism; still less are we in a position to contradict it. On the
   contrary, there is a strong probability that when he made his public
   appearance he had already settled accounts with himself. The
   evangelists preface their account of his public activity with a curious
   story of a temptation. This story assumes that he was already conscious
   of being the Son of God and the one who was intrusted with the
   all-important work for God's people, and that he had overcome the
   temptations which this consciousness brought with it. When John sent to
   him from prison to ask, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look
   for another?" the answer which he sent necessarily led his questioner
   to understand that he was the Messiah, but at the same time showed him
   how Jesus conceived the Messianic office. Then came the day at Caesarea
   Philippi, when Peter acknowledged him as the expected Messiah, and
   Jesus joyfully confirmed what he said. This was followed by the
   question to the Pharisees,--"What think ye of Christ, whose son is
   he?"--the scene which ended with the fresh question: "If David then
   call him Lord, how is he his son?" Lastly, there was the entry into
   Jerusalem before the whole people, together with the cleansing of the
   temple; actions which were equivalent to a public declaration that he
   was the Messiah. But his first unequivocal Messianic action was also
   his last. It was followed by the crown of thorns and the cross.

   I have said that it is probable that when Jesus made his public
   appearance he had already settled accounts with himself, and was
   therefore clear about his mission as well. By this, however, I do not
   mean that, so far as he himself was concerned,. he had nothing more to
   learn in the course of it. Not only had he to learn to suffer, and to
   look forward to the cross with confidence in God, but the consciousness
   of his Sonship was now for the first time to be brought to the test.
   The knowledge of the "work" which the Father had intrusted to him could
   not be developed except by labour and by victory over all opposition.
   What a moment it must have been for him when he recognised that he was
   the one of whom the prophets had spoken; when he saw the whole history
   of his nation from Abraham and Moses downwards in the light of his own
   mission; when he could no longer avoid the conviction that he was the
   promised Messiah! No longer avoid it; for how can we refuse to believe
   that at first he must have felt this knowledge to be a terrible burden?
   Yet in saying this we have gone too far; and there is nothing more that
   we can say. But in this connexion we can understand that the evangelist
   John was right in making Jesus testify over and over again: "I have not
   spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me; he gave me a
   commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak." And again:
   "For I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."

   But however we may conceive the "Messiah," it was an assumption that
   was simply necessary if the man who felt the inward call was to gain an
   absolute recognition within the lines of Jewish religious history the
   profoundest and maturest history that any nation ever possessed, nay,
   as the future was to show, the true religious history for all mankind.
   The idea of the Messiah became the means--in the first instance for the
   devout of his own nation--of effectively setting the man who knew that
   he was the Son of God, and was doing the work of God, on the throne of
   history. But when it had accomplished this, its mission was exhausted.
   Jesus was the "Messiah," and was not the Messiah; and he was not the
   Messiah, because he left the idea far behind him; because he put a
   meaning into it which was too much for it to bear. Although the idea
   may strike us as strange we can still feel some of its meaning; an idea
   which captivated a whole nation for centuries, and in which it
   deposited all its ideals, cannot be quite unintelligible. In the
   prospect of a Messianic period we see once more the old hope of a
   golden age; the hope which, when moralised, must necessarily be the
   goal of every vigorous movement in human life and forms an inalienable
   element in the religious view of history; in the expectation of a
   personal Messiah we see an expression of the fact that it is persons
   who form the saving element in history, and that if a union of mankind
   is ever to come about by their deepest forces and highest aims being
   brought into accord, this same mankind must agree to acknowledge one
   lord and master. But beyond this there is no other meaning and no other
   value to be attached to the Messianic idea; Jesus himself deprived it
   of them.

   With the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah the closest possible
   connexion was established, for every devout Jew, between Jesus' message
   and his person; for it is in the Messiah's activity that God Himself
   comes to His people, and the Messiah who does God's work and sits at
   the right hand of God in the clouds of heaven has a right to be
   worshipped. But what attitude did Jesus himself take up towards his
   Gospel? Does he assume a position in it? To this question there are two
   answers: one negative and one positive.

   In those leading features of it which we described in the earlier
   lectures the whole of the Gospel is contained, and we must keep it free
   from the intrusion of any alien element: God and the soul, the soul and
   its God. There was no doubt in Jesus' mind that God could be found, and
   had been found, in the law and the prophets. "He hath showed thee, O
   man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
   justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" He takes
   the publican in the temple, the widow and her mite, the lost son, as
   his examples; none of them know anything about "Christology," and yet
   by his humility the publican was justified. These are facts which
   cannot be turned and twisted without doing violence to the grandeur and
   simplicity of Jesus' message in one of its most important aspects.To
   contend that Jesus meant his whole message to be taken provisionally,
   and everything in it to receive a different interpretation after his
   death and resurrection, nay, parts of it to be put aside as of no
   account, is a desperate supposition. No! his message is simpler than
   the churches would like to think it; simpler, but for that very reason
   sterner and endowed with a greater claim to universality. A man cannot
   evade it by the subterfuge of saying that as he can make nothing of
   this "Christology" the message is not for him. Jesus directed men's
   attention to great questions; he promised them God's grace and mercy;
   he required them to decide whether they would have God or Mammon, an
   eternal or an earthly life, the soul or the body, humility or
   self-righteousness, love or selfishness, the truth or a lie. The sphere
   which these questions occupy is all-embracing; the individual is called
   upon to listen to the glad message of mercy and the Fatherhood of God,
   and to make up his mind whether he will be on God's side and the
   Eternal's, or on the side of the world and of time. The Gospel, as
   Jesus proclaimed it, has to do with the Father only and not with the
   Son. This is no paradox, nor, on the other hand, is it "rationalism,"
   but the simple expression of the actual fact as the evangelists give
   it.

   But no one had ever yet known the Father in the way in which Jesus knew
   Him, and to this knowledge of Him he draws other men's attention, and
   thereby does "the many" an incomparable service. He leads them to God,
   not only by what he says, but still more by what he is and does, and
   ultimately by what he suffers. It was in this sense that he spoke the
   words, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest"; as also, "The Son of Man came not to be ministered
   unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." He
   knows that through him a new epoch is beginning, in which, by their
   knowledge of God, the "least" shall be greater than the greatest of the
   ages before; he knows that in him thousands -- the very individuals who
   are weary and heavy laden--will find the Father and gain life; he knows
   that he is the sower who is scattering good seed; his is the field, his
   the seed, his the fruit. These things involve no dogmatic doctrines;
   still less any transformation of the Gospel itself, or any oppressive
   demands upon our faith. They are the expression of an actual fact which
   he perceives to be already happening, and which, with prophetic
   assurance, he beholds in advance. When, under the terrible burden of
   his calling and in the midst of the struggle, he comes to see that it
   is through him that the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the
   poor have the Gospel preached to them, he begins to comprehend the
   glory which the Father has given him. And he sees that what he now
   suffers in his person will, through his life crowned in death, remain a
   fact efficacious and of critical importance for all time: He is the way
   to the Father, and as he is the appointed of the Father, so he is the
   judge as well.

   Was he mistaken? Neither his immediate posterity, nor the course of
   subsequent history, has decided against him. It is not as a mere factor
   that he is connected with the Gospel; he was its personal realisation
   and its strength, and this he is felt to be still. Fire is kindled only
   by fire; personal life only by personal forces. Let us rid ourselves of
   all dogmatic sophistry, and leave others to pass verdicts of exclusion.
   The Gospel nowhere says that God's mercy is limited to Jesus' mission.
   But history shows us that he is the one who brings the weary and heavy
   laden to God; and, again, that he it was who raised mankind to the new
   level; and his teaching is still the touchstone, in that it brings men
   to bliss and brings them to judgment.

   The sentence "I am the Son of God" was not inserted in the Gospel by
   Jesus himself, and to put that sentence there side by side with the
   others is to make an addition to the Gospel. But no one who accepts the
   Gospel, and tries to understand him who gave it to us, can fail to
   affirm that here the divine appeared in as pure a form as it can appear
   on earth, and to feel that for those who followed him Jesus was himself
   the strength of the Gospel. What they experienced, however, and came to
   know in and through him, they have told the world; and their message is
   still a living force.

   (6) The Gospel and doctrine, or the question of creed.

   We need not dwell long on this question, as on the essential
   points--everything that it is necessary to say has already been said in
   the course of our previous observations.

   The Gospel is no theoretical system of doctrine or philosophy of the
   universe; it is doctrine only in so far as it proclaims the reality of
   God the Father. It is a glad message assuring us of life eternal, and
   telling us what the things and the forces with which we have to do are
   worth. By treating of life eternal it teaches us how to lead our lives
   aright. It tells us of the value of the human soul, of humility, of
   mercy, of purity, of the cross, and the worthlessness of worldly goods
   and anxiety for the things of which earthly life consists. And it gives
   the assurance that, in spite of every struggle, peace, certainty, and
   something within that can never be destroyed will be the crown of a
   life rightly led. What else can "the confession of a creed" mean under
   these conditions but to do the will of God, in the certainty that He is
   the Father and the one who will recompense? Jesus never spoke of any
   other kind of "creed." Even when he says, "Whosoever shall confess me
   before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
   heaven," he is thinking of people doing as he did; he means the
   confession which shows itself in feeling and action. How great a
   departure from what he thought and enjoined is involved in putting a
   Christological creed in the forefront of the Gospel, and in teaching
   that before a man can approach it he must learn to think rightly about
   Christ. That is putting the cart before the horse. A man can think and
   teach rightly about Christ only if, and in so far as, he has already
   begun to live according to Christ's Gospel.. There is no forecourt to
   his message through which a man must pass; no yoke which he must first
   of all take upon himself. The thoughts and assurances which the Gospel
   provides are the first thing and the last thing, and every soul is
   directly arraigned before them.

   Still less, however, does the Gospel presuppose any definite knowledge
   of nature, or stand in any connexion with such knowledge; not even in a
   negative sense can this contention be maintained. It is religion and
   the moral element that are concerned. The Gospel puts the living God
   before us. Here, too, the confession of Him in belief in Him and in the
   fulfilment of His will is the sole thing to be confessed; this is what
   Jesus Christ meant. So far as the knowledge is concerned--and it is
   vast--which may be based upon this belief, it always varies with the
   measure of a man's inner development and subjective intelligence. But
   to possess the Lord of heaven and earth as a Father is an experience to
   which nothing else approaches; and it is an experience which the
   poorest soul can have, and to the reality of which he can bear
   testimony.

   An experience--it is only the religion which a man has himself
   experienced that is to be confessed; every other creed or confession is
   in Jesus' view hypocritical and fatal. If there is no broad "theory of
   religion" to be found in the Gospel, still less is there any direction
   that a man is to begin by accepting and confessing any ready-made
   theory. Faith and creed are to proceed and grow up out of the
   all-important act of turning from the world and to God, and creed is to
   be nothing but faith reduced to practice. "All men have not faith,"
   says the apostle Paul, but all men ought to be veracious and be on
   their guard in religion against lip-service and light-hearted assent to
   creeds. "A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first and said,
   Son, go work to-day in my vineyard. He answered and said, I will not;
   but afterward he repented and went. And he came to the second, and said
   likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir; and went not."

   I might stop here, but I am impelled to answer one more objection. The
   Gospel, it is said, is a great and sublime thing, and it has certainly
   been a saving power in history, but it is indissolubly connected with
   an antiquated view of the world and history; and, therefore, although
   it be painful to say so, and we have nothing better to put in its
   place, it has lost its validity and can have no further significance
   for us. In view of this objection there are two things which I should
   like to say:--

   Firstly, no doubt it is true that the view of the world and history
   with which the Gospel is connected is quite different from ours, and
   that view we cannot recall to life, and would not if we could; but
   "indissoluble" the connexion is not. I have tried to show what the
   essential elements in the Gospel are, and these elements are
   "timeless." Not only are they so; but the man to whom the Gospel
   addresses itself is also "timeless," that is to say, he is the man who,
   in spite of all progress and development, never changes in his inmost
   constitution and in his fundamental relations with the external world.
   Since that is so, this Gospel remains in force, then, for us too.

   Secondly, the Gospel is based--and this is the all-important element in
   the view which it takes of the world and history--upon the antithesis
   between Spirit and flesh, God and the world, good and evil. Now, in
   spite of ardent efforts, thinkers have not yet succeeded in elaborating
   on a monistic basis any theory of ethics that is satisfactory and
   answers to the deepest needs of man. Nor will they succeed. In the end,
   then, it is essentially a matter of indifference what name we give to
   the opposition with which every man of ethical feeling is concerned:
   God and the world, the Here and the Beyond, the visible and the
   invisible, matter and spirit, the life of impulse and the life of
   freedom, physics and ethics. That there is a unity underlying this
   opposition is a conviction which can be gained by experience; the one
   realm can be subordinated to the other; but it is only by a struggle
   that this unity can be attained, and when it is attained it takes the
   form of a problem that is infinite and only approximately soluble. It
   cannot be attained by any refinement of a mechanical process. It is by
   self-conquest that a man is freed from the tyranny of matter

   Von der Gewalt die alle Wesen bindet
   Befreit der Mensch sich der sich überwindet.

   This saying of Goethe's excellently expresses the truth that is here in
   question. It is a truth which holds good for all time, and it forms the
   essential element in the dramatic pictures of contemporary life in
   which the Gospel exhibits the antithesis that is to be overcome. I do
   not know how our increased knowledge of nature is to hinder us from
   bearing witness to the truth of the creed that "The world passeth away,
   and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth
   forever." We have to do with a dualism which arose we know not how; but
   as moral beings we are convinced that, as it has been given us in order
   that we may overcome it in ourselves and bring it to a unity, so also
   it goes back to an original unity, and will at last find its
   reconciliation in the great far-off event, the realised dominion of the
   Good.

   Dreams, it may be said; for what we see before our eyes is something
   very different. No! not dreams--after all it is here that our true life
   has its root--but patchwork certainly, for we are unable to bring our
   knowledge in space and time, together with the contents of our inner
   life, into the unity of a philosophic theory of the world. It is only
   in the peace of God which passeth all understanding that this unity
   dawns upon us.

   But we have already passed beyond the limits of our immediate task. We
   proposed 1to acquaint ourselves with the Gospel in its fundamental
   features and in its most important bearings. I have tried to respond to
   this task; but the last point which we touched takes us beyond it. We
   now return to it, in order to follow, in the second part of these
   lectures, the course of the Christian religion through history.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE IX

   THE task before us in the second half of these lectures is to exhibit
   the history of the Christian religion in its leading phases, and to
   examine its development in the apostolic age, in Catholicism, and in
   Protestantism.

  THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN THE APOSTOLIC AGE

   The inner circle of the disciples, the band of twelve whom Jesus had
   gathered around him, formed itself into a community. He himself founded
   no community in the sense of an organised union for divine worship--he
   was only the teacher and the disciples were the pupils; but the fact
   that the band of pupils at once underwent this transformation became
   the ground upon which all subsequent developments rested. What were the
   characteristic features of this society? Unless I am mistaken there
   were three factors at work in it: (i.) The_ recognition of Jesus as the
   living Lord; (ii.) the fact that in every individual member of the new
   community--including the very slaves--religion was an actual
   experience, and involved the consciousness of a living union with God;
   (iii.) the leading of a holy life in purity and brotherly fellowship,
   and the expectation of the Christ's return in the near future.

   By keeping these three factors in view we can grasp the distinctive
   characters of the new community. Let us look at them more closely.

   1. Jesus Christ the Lord.--In thus confessing their belief in him his
   disciples took the first step in continuing their recognition of him as
   the authoritative teacher, of his word as their permanent standard of
   life, of their desire to keep "everything that he commanded them." But
   this does not express the full meaning attaching to the words "the
   Lord"; nay, it is far from touching their peculiar significance. The
   primitive community called Jesus its Lord because he had sacrificed his
   life for it, and because its members were convinced that he had been
   raised from the dead and was then sitting on the right hand of God.
   There is no historical fact more certain than that the apostle Paul was
   not, as we might perhaps expect, the first to emphasise so prominently
   the significance of Christ's death and resurrection, but that in
   recognising their meaning he stood exactly on the same ground as the
   primitive community. "I delivered unto you first of all," he wrote to
   the Corinthians, "that which I also received, how that Christ died for
   our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that
   he rose again the third day." Paul did, it is true, make Christ's death
   and resurrection the subject of a particular speculative idea, and, so
   to speak, reduced the whole of the Gospel to these events; but they
   were already accepted as fundamental facts by the circle of Jesus'
   personal disciples and by the primitive community. In these two facts
   it may be said that the permanent recognition of Jesus Christ, and the
   reverence and adoration which he received, obtained their first hold.
   They formed the ground on which the whole Christological theory rested.
   But within two generations from his death Jesus Christ was already put
   upon the highest plane upon which men can put him. As men were
   conscious of him as the living Lord, he was glorified as the one who
   had been raised to the right hand of God and had vanquished death; as
   the Prince of Life, as the strength of a new existence, as the way, the
   truth, and the life. The Messianic ideas permitted of his being placed
   upon God's throne, without endangering monotheism. But, above all, he
   was felt to be the active principle of individual life: "It is not I
   that live, but Christ that liveth in me"; he is "my" life, and to press
   onwards to him through death is great gain. Where can we find in the
   history of mankind any similar instance of men eating and drinking with
   their master, seeing him in the characteristic aspects of his humanity,
   and then proclaiming him not only as the great prophet and revealer of
   God, but as the divine disposer of history, as the "beginning" of God's
   creation, and as the inner strength of a new life! It was not thus that
   Mohammed's disciples spoke of their prophet. Neither is it sufficient
   to assert that the Messianic predicates were simply transferred to
   Jesus, and that everything may be explained by Jesus' expected return
   in glory throwing its radiance backwards. True, in the certain hope of
   Jesus' return, his "coming in lowliness" was overlooked; but that it
   was possible to conceive this certain hope and hold it fast; that in
   spite of suffering and death it was possible to see in him the promised
   Messiah; and that in and side by side with the vulgar Messianic image
   of him, men felt and opened their hearts to him as the present Lord and
   Saviour,---that is what is so astonishing! It was just the death "for
   our sins," and the resurrection, which confirmed the impression given
   by his person, and provided faith with a sure hold: he died as a
   sacrifice for us, and he now lives.

   There are many to-day who have come to regard both these positions as
   very strange; and their attitude towards them is one of
   indifference--towards the death, on the ground that no such
   significance can be attributed to a single event of this kind; towards
   the resurrection, because what is here affirmed to have happened is
   incredible.

   It is not our business to defend either the view which was taken of the
   death, or the idea that he had risen again; but it is certainly the
   historian's duty to make himself so fully acquainted with both
   positions as to be sensible of the significance which they possessed
   and still possess. That these positions were of capital importance for
   the primitive community has never been doubted; even Strauss did not
   dispute it; and the great critic, Ferdinand Christian Baur,
   acknowledged that it was on the belief in them that the earliest
   Christian communion was built up. It must be possible, then, for us in
   our turn to get a feeling and an understanding for what they were; nay,
   perhaps we may do more; if we probe the history of religion to the
   bottom, we shall find the truth and justice of ideas which on the
   surface seem so paradoxical and incredible lying at the very roots of
   the faith.

   Let us first consider the idea that Jesus' death on the cross was one
   of expiation. Now, if we were to consider the conception attaching to
   the words "expiatory death" in the alien realm of formal speculation,
   we should, it is true, soon find ourselves in a blind alley, and every
   chance of our understanding the idea would vanish. We should be
   absolutely at the end of our tether if we were to indulge in
   speculations as to the necessity which can have compelled God to
   require such a sacrificial death. Let us, in the first place, bear in
   mind a fact in the history of religion which is quite universal. Those
   who looked upon this death as a sacrifice soon ceased to offer God any
   blood-sacrifice at all. The value attaching to such sacrifices had, it
   is true, been in doubt for generations, and had been steadily
   diminishing; but it was only now that the sacrifices disappeared
   altogether. They did not disappear immediately or at one stroke,--this
   is a point with which we need not concern ourselves here,--but their
   disappearance took place within a very brief period and was not delayed
   until after the destruction of the temple. Further, wherever the
   Christian message subsequently penetrated, the sacrificial altars were
   deserted and dealers in sacrificial beasts found no more purchasers. If
   there is one thing that is certain in the history of religion, it is
   that the death of Christ put an end to all blood-sacrifices. But that
   they are based on a deep religious idea is proved by the extent to
   which they existed among so many nations, and they are not to be judged
   from the point of view of cold and blind rationalism, but from that of
   vivid emotion. If it is obvious that they respond to a religious need;
   if, further, it is certain that the instinct which led to them found
   its satisfaction and therefore its goal in Christ's death; if, lastly,
   there was the express declaration, as we read in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, that "by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified," we can no longer feel this idea of Christ's sacrifice to
   be so very strange; for history has decided in its favour, and we are
   beginning to get in touch with it. His death had the value of an
   expiatory sacrifice, for otherwise it would not have had strength to
   penetrate into that inner world in which the blood-sacrifices
   originated; but it was not a sacrifice in the same sense as the others,
   or else it could not have put an end to them; it suppressed them by
   settling accounts with them. Nay, we may go further; the validity of
   all material sacrifices was destroyed by Christ's death. Wherever
   individual Christians or whole churches have returned to them, it has
   been a relapse: the earliest Christians knew that the whole sacrificial
   system was thenceforth abolished, and if they asked for a reason, they
   pointed to Christ's death.

   In the second place: any one who will look into history will find that
   the sufferings of the pure and the just are its saving element; that is
   to say, that it is not words, but deeds, and not deeds only but
   self-sacrificing deeds, and not only self-sacrificing deeds, but the
   surrender of life itself, that forms the turning-point in every great
   advance in history. In this sense I believe that, however far we may
   stand from any theories about vicarious sacrifice, there are few of us
   after all who will mistake the truth and inner justice of such a
   description as we read in Isaiah liii.: "Surely he hath borne our
   griefs and carried our sorrows." "Greater love hath no man than this,
   that a man lay down his life for his friends"--it is in this light that
   Jesus' death was regarded from the beginning. Wherever any great deed
   has been accomplished in history, the finer a man's moral feelings are,
   the more sensible will he be of vicarious suffering; the more he will
   bring that suffering into relation to himself. Did Luther in the
   monastery strive only for himself?--was it not for us all that he
   inwardly bled when he fought with the religion that was handed down to
   him? But it was by the cross of Jesus Christ that mankind gained such
   an experience of the power of purity and love true to death that they
   can never forget it, and that it signifies a new epoch in their
   history.

   Finally, in the third place: no reflection of the "reason," no
   deliberation of the "intelligence," will ever be able to expunge from
   the moral ideas of mankind the conviction that injustice and sin
   deserve to be punished, and that everywhere that the just man suffers,
   an atonement is made which puts us to shame and purifies us. It is a
   conviction which is impenetrable, for it comes out of those depths in
   which we feel ourselves to be a unity, and out of the world which lies
   behind the world of phenomena. Mocked and denied as though it had long
   perished, this truth is indestructibly preserved in the moral
   experience of mankind. These are the ideas which from the beginning
   onwards have been roused by Christ's death, and have, as it were,
   played around it. Other ideas have been disengaged,--ideas of less
   importance but, nevertheless, very efficacious at times,--but these are
   the most powerful. They have taken shape in the firm conviction that by
   his death in suffering he did a definitive work; that he did it "for
   us." Were we to attempt to measure and register what he did, as was
   soon attempted, we should fall into dreadful paradoxes; but we can in
   our turn feel it for ourselves with the same freedom with which it was
   originally felt. If we also consider that Jesus himself described his
   death as a service which he was rendering to many, and that by a solemn
   act he instituted a lasting remembrance of it--I see no reason to doubt
   the fact--we can understand how this death and the shame of the cross
   were bound to take the central place.

   Jesus, however, was proclaimed as "the Lord" not only because he had
   died for sinners but because he was the risen and the living one. If
   the resurrection meant nothing but that a deceased body of flesh and
   blood came to life again, we should make short work of this tradition.
   But it is not so. The New Testament itself distinguishes between the
   Easter message of the empty grave and the appearances of Jesus on the
   one side, and the Easter faith on the other. Although the greatest
   value is attached to that message, we are to hold the Easter faith even
   in its absence. The story of Thomas is told for the exclusive purpose
   of impressing upon us that we must hold the Easter faith even without
   the Easter message: "Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have
   believed." The disciples on the road to Emmaus were blamed for not
   believing in the resurrection even though the Easter message had not
   yet reached them. The Lord is a Spirit, says Paul; and this carries
   with it the certainty of his resurrection. The Easter message tells us
   of that wonderful event in Joseph of Arimathaea's garden, which,
   however, no eye saw; it tells us of the empty grave into which a few
   women and disciples looked; of the appearance of the Lord in a
   transfigured form--so glorified that his own could not immediately
   recognise him; it soon begins to tell us, too, of what the risen one
   said and did. The reports became more and more complete, and more and
   more confident. But the Easter faith is the conviction that the
   crucified one gained a victory over death; that God is just and
   powerful; that he who is the firstborn among many brethren still lives.
   Paul based his Easter faith upon the certainty that "the second Adam"
   was from heaven, and upon his experience, on the way to Damascus, of
   God revealing His Son to him as still alive. God, he said, revealed him
   "in me"; but this inner revelation was coupled with "a vision"
   overwhelming as vision never was afterwards. Did the apostle know of
   the message about the empty grave? While there are theologians of note
   who doubt it, I think it probable; but we cannot be quite certain about
   it. Certain it is that what he and the disciples regarded as
   all-important was not the state in which the grave was found, but
   Christ's appearances. But who of us can maintain that a clear account
   of these appearances can be constructed out of the stories told by Paul
   and the evangelists; and if that be impossible, and there is no
   tradition of single events which is quite trustworthy, how is the
   Easter faith to be based on them? Either we must decide to rest our
   belief on a foundation unstable and always exposed to fresh doubts, or
   else we must abandon this foundation altogether, and with it the
   miraculous appeal to our senses. But here, too, the images of the faith
   have their roots in truth and reality. Whatever may have happened at
   the grave and in the matter of the appearances, one thing is certain:
   This grave was the birthplace of the indestructible belief that death
   is vanquished, and there is a life eternal. It is useless to cite
   Plato; it is useless to point to the Persian religion, and the ideas
   and the literature of later Judaism. All that would have perished and
   has perished; but the certainty of the resurrection and of a life
   eternal which is bound up with the grave in Joseph's garden has not
   perished, and on the conviction that Jesus lives we still base those
   hopes of citizenship in an Eternal City which make our earthly life
   worth living and tolerable. "He delivered them who through fear of
   death were all their lifetime subject to bondage," as the writer of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews confesses. That is the point. And although there
   be exceptions to its sway, wherever, despite all the weight of nature,
   there is a strong faith in the infinite value of the soul; wherever
   death has lost its terrors; wherever the sufferings of the present are
   measured against a future of glory, this feeling of life is bound up
   with the conviction that Jesus Christ has passed through death, that
   God has awakened him and raised him to life and glory. What else can we
   believe but that the earliest disciples also found the ultimate
   foundation of their faith in the living Lord to be the strength which
   had gone out from him? It was a life never to be destroyed which they
   felt to be going out from him; only for a brief span of time could his
   death stagger them; the strength of the Lord prevailed over everything;
   God did not give him over to death; he lives as the first-fruits of
   those who have fallen asleep. It is not by any speculative ideas of
   philosophy but by the vision of Jesus' life and death and by the
   feeling of his imperishable union with God that mankind, so far as it
   believes in these things, has attained to that certainty of eternal
   life for which it was meant, and which it dimly discerns--eternal life
   in time and beyond time. This feeling first established faith in the
   value of personal life. But of every attempt to demonstrate the
   certainty of "immortality" by logical process, we may say in the words
   of the poet:

   Believe and venture: as for pledges,
   The gods give none.

   Belief in the living Lord and in a life eternal is the act of the
   freedom which is born of God.

   As the crucified and risen one Jesus was the Lord. While this
   confession of belief in him expressed a man's whole relation to him, it
   also afforded endless matter for thought and speculation. This
   conception of the "Lord" came to embrace the many-sided image of the
   Messiah and all the Old Testament prophecies of a similar kind. But as
   yet no ecclesiastical "doctrines" about him had been elaborated;
   everyone who acknowledged him as the Lord belonged to the community.

   2. Religion as an actual experience.--The second characteristic feature
   of the primitive community is that every individual in it, even the
   very slaves, possess a living experience of God. This is sufficiently
   remarkable; for at first sight we might think that all this devotion to
   Christ, and this unconditional reverence for him, must necessarily have
   resulted in all religion becoming a punctilious subjection to his
   words, and so a kind of voluntary servitude. But the Pauline epistles
   and the Acts of the Apostles give us quite a different picture. While
   they do, indeed, attest the fact that Jesus' words were held in
   unqualified reverence, this fact is not the most prominent feature in
   the picture of earliest Christendom. What is much more characteristic
   is that individual Christians, moved by the Spirit of God, are placed
   in a living and entirely personal relation to God Himself. Dr. Weinel
   has lately presented us with a fine work on the Workings of the Spirit
   and the Spirits in the Post-Apostolic Age. It contains many passages
   which take us back to the apostolic age and treat in greater detail of
   the matters which Professor Gunkel has so impressively placed before us
   in his treatise on The Holy Ghost. The neglected problems of the extent
   to which, and the forms in which, the Spirit exercised an influence on
   the life of the early Christians, and of the view to be taken of the
   phenomena connected with this influence, are admirably discussed by Dr.
   Weinel. In substance, his conclusion is that the expressions
   "receiving" and "acting by" the Holy Ghost signify such an independence
   and immediacy of religious life and feeling, and such an inner union
   with God, perceived to be the mightiest reality, as could not have been
   expected from strict subjection to Jesus' authority. To be the child of
   God and to be gifted with the Spirit are simply the same as being a
   disciple of Christ. That a man is not truly a disciple unless he is
   pervaded by God's Spirit is a point which the Acts of the Apostles
   fully recognises. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit is placed in the
   forefront of the narrative. The author is conscious that the Christian
   religion would not be the highest and the ultimate religion unless it
   brought every individual into an immediate and living connexion with
   God. This mutual union of a full, obedient subjection to the Lord with
   freedom in the Spirit is the most important feature in the distinctive
   character of this religion, and the seal of its greatness. The workings
   of the Spirit were shown everywhere, in the entire domain of the five
   senses, in the sphere of will and action, in profound philosophical
   speculation, and in the most delicate appreciation of the facts of the
   moral life. The elementary forces of the religious temperament, long
   held in check by systems of doctrine and the ceremonies of public
   worship, were again set free. They showed themselves in ecstatic
   phenomena, in signs and wonders, in an enhancement of all the functions
   of life, down to conditions of a pathological and suspicious character.
   The fact, however, was not forgotten,--and where it threatened to be
   obscured it was strongly impressed on people's attention,--that those
   strange and violent phenomena were individual, but that side by side
   with them there are workings of the Spirit which are bestowed upon
   everyone and with which no one can dispense. But "The fruit of the
   Spirit," as the apostle Paul writes, "is love, joy, peace,
   long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." The
   other feature in the distinctive character and greatness of this
   religion is that it does not overestimate the elementary strength which
   gave it birth; that it makes its spiritual purport and its discipline
   triumph over all states of ecstasy; and that it holds immovably to its
   conviction that the Spirit of God, however it may reveal itself, is a
   Spirit of holiness and of love. But here we have already passed to the
   third feature which characterises early Christendom.

   3. The third feature is the leading of a holy life in purity and
   brotherly fellowship and in the expectation of Christ's speedy return.
   The course which the history of the Church followed resulted in the
   dogmatic details in the New Testament being selected for investigation,
   rather than those parts of it which depicted the life of the first
   Christians and exhorted men to morality. And yet not only are the New
   Testament epistles largely taken up with these moral exhortations, but
   not a few of the so-called dogmatic portions were also written solely
   for moral admonition. Jesus directed his disciples to give these
   exhortations the first place, and the earliest Christians were well
   aware that the first business of life was to do the will of God and
   present themselves as a holy community. Upon this their whole existence
   and their mission in the world were based. There were two points which,
   in accordance with Jesus' teaching, they put first and foremost, and
   they were points which at bottom embraced the whole range of moral
   action purity and brotherly fellowship. They took purity in the deepest
   and most comprehensive sense of the word, as the horror of everything
   that is unholy, and as the inner pleasure in everything that is upright
   and true, lovely and of good report. They also meant purity in regard
   to the body: "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
   Ghost which is in you? therefore glorify God in your body." In this
   sublime consciousness the earliest Christians took up the struggle
   against the sins of impurity, which in the heathen world were not
   accounted sins at all. As sons of God, "blameless and harmless in the
   midst of a crooked and perverse nation," they were to "shine as lights
   in the world." It was thus that they were to show of what they were
   made, and it was thus that they showed it: to be holy as God was holy,
   to be pure as disciples of Christ. Here, too, we get the measure of the
   renunciation of the world which this community imposed upon itself. "To
   keep oneself unspotted from the world" was the asceticism which it
   practised itself and required of its adherents. The other point is
   brotherly fellowship. In joining the love of God with the love of
   neighbour in his sayings, Jesus himself had a new union of men with one
   another in view. The earliest Christians understood him. From the very
   first they constituted themselves into a brotherly union, not in word
   only but in deed--a living realisation of what he meant. In calling
   themselves "brothers," they felt all the obligations which the name
   imposes and tried to come up to them, not by legal regulations but by
   voluntary service, each according to the measure of his own powers and
   gifts. The Acts of the Apostles tell us that in Jerusalem they went so
   far as to have a voluntary community of goods. Paul says nothing about
   it; and if we are to accept this obscure report as really trustworthy,
   then neither Paul nor the Christian communities among the Gentiles took
   pattern by the enterprise. They seem not to have been required, nor to
   have thought it desirable, to order their lives afresh in externals.
   The brotherly fellowship which "the holy" were to cultivate, and did
   cultivate, was distinguished by two principles: "Whether one member
   suffer, all the members suffer with it," and "Bear ye one another's
   burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ."

LECTURE X

   IT was as their Lord that the primitive community of Christians
   believed in Jesus. They thus expressed their absolute devotion to, and
   confidence in, him as the Prince of Life. As every individual Christian
   stood in an immediate relation to God through the Spirit, priests and
   mediations were no longer wanted. Finally, these "holy" people were
   drawn together into societies, which bound themselves to a strictly
   moral life in purity and brotherly fellowship. On the last point let me
   add a few words.

   It is a proof of the inwardness and moral power of the new message
   that, in spite of the enthusiasm arising from personal experience of
   religion, there were relatively seldom any extravagant outbursts and
   violent movements to be combated. Such movements may have been more
   frequent than the direct declarations of our authorities allow us to
   suppose, but they did not form the rule; and when they arose Paul was
   certainly not the only one who was concerned to put them down. He had
   certainly no wish to quench the "Spirit," but when enthusiasm
   threatened to lead to a repugnance to work, as in Thessalonica, or
   when, as in Corinth, there was a superabundance of ecstatic talk, he
   uttered some sober warnings: "If any would not work, neither should he
   eat," and "I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by
   my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an
   unknown tongue." Still more plainly are the concentrated repose and
   power of the leaders shown in the moral admonitions, such as we get not
   only in the Pauline epistles but also, for example, in the First
   Epistle of Peter and in the general Epistle of James. Christian
   character is to show itself in the essential circumstances of human
   life, and that life is to be invigrated, supported, and illumined by
   the Spirit. In the relation of husband to wife and of wife to husband,
   of parents to children, of masters to servants; further, in the
   individual's relation to constituted authority, to the surrounding
   heathen world, and, again, to the widow and the orphan, is "the service
   of God" to be proved and tested. Where have we another example in
   history of a religion intervening with such a robust supernatural
   consciousness, and at the same time laying the moral foundations of the
   earthly life of the community so firmly as this message? If a man fails
   to be inwardly affected by the faith proclaimed by the New Testament
   writers, he must certainly be stirred to the depths by the purity, the
   wealth, the power, and the delicacy of the moral knowledge which
   invests their exhortations with such incomparable value.

   There is another feature of the life of the earliest Christians which
   also deserves notice in this connexion. They lived in the expectation
   of Christ's near return. This hope supplied them with an
   extraordinarily strong motive for disregarding earthly things, and the
   joys and sufferings of this world. That they were mistaken in their
   expectation we must freely grant; but nevertheless it was a highly
   efficacious lever for raising them above the world, and teaching them
   to make little of small things and much of great things, and to
   distinguish between what is of time and what is of eternity. For a new
   and powerful religious impulse, which effects its own influence, to be
   associated with another factor which enhances and strengthens that
   influence, is what we see constantly happening in the history of
   religion. With every renewal of the religious experience of sin and
   grace since Augustine's day, what a lever has been supplied by the idea
   of predestination, and yet it is an idea which is in no way derived
   from that experience itself. How much enthusiasm was inspired in
   Cromwell's troops, and how greatly were the Puritans on both sides of
   the ocean strengthened by the consciousness of adoption, although this
   consciousness, too, was only an adjunct. When the religious experiences
   of St. Francis developed in the Middle Ages into a new form of
   devotion, how much assistance it received from the doctrine of poverty,
   and yet this doctrine was an independent force. The conviction which
   obtained in the apostolic age that the Lord had really appeared after
   his death on the cross may also be regarded in the same light. What we
   are thus taught is that the most inward of all possessions, namely,
   religion, does not struggle up into life free and isolated, but grows,
   so to speak, in coverings of bark and cannot grow without them. In
   studying the apostolic age, however, it is important to observe that,
   not only in spite of the religious enthusiasm but even in spite of the
   intense eschatological hopes which prevailed, the task of making
   earthly life holy was not neglected.

   The three principles which we have emphasised as contributing most to
   the characteristic features of primitive Christianity could also, if
   necessary, have been brought to bear within the framework of Judaism
   and in connexion with the synagogue. There, too, Jesus could have been
   acknowledged as the Lord, the new experience united with the ancestral
   religion, and the society of brothers developed in the form of a Jewish
   conventicle. In Palestine, as a matter of fact, this was the form which
   the earliest communities took. But the new principles displayed great
   vigour and pointed far beyond Judaism: Jesus Christ the Lord is not
   only Israel's Lord, but the Lord of history, the Lord of all men. The
   new experience of a direct union with God makes the old worship with
   its priests and mediations unnecessary. The society of brothers towers
   over all other associations, and deprives them of any value. The inner
   development which the new tendency virtually comprised began at once:
   Paul was not the first to start it; before and side by side with him
   there were obscure and nameless Christians in the Dispersion who took
   up Gentiles into the new society. They did away with the
   particularistic and statutory regulations of the law by declaring that
   they were to be understood in a purely spiritual sense and to be
   interpreted as symbols. There was a branch of the Jewish world outside
   Palestine where this declaration had long taken actual effect--it is
   true, on other grounds--and where the Jewish religion was being freed
   from its limitations by a process of philosophical interpretation which
   was bringing it to the level of a spiritual religion for the whole
   world. This development may be regarded in the light of a preliminary
   stage in the history of Christianity, and was in many respects really
   so. It was the stage on which those nameless Christians entered. It was
   the path upon which a deliverance from historical Judaism and its
   outworn religious ordinances was capable of gradual attainment. But one
   thing is certain: it was not the goal of the movement. So long as the
   words "the former religion is done away with" remained unspoken, there
   was always a fear that in the next generation the old precepts would be
   brought forward again in their literal meaning. How often and often in
   the history of religion has there been a tendency to do away with some
   traditional form of doctrine or ritual which has ceased to satisfy
   inwardly, but to do away with it by giving it a new interpretation. The
   endeavour seems to be succeeding; the temper and the knowledge
   prevailing at the moment are favourable to it--when, lo and behold! the
   old meaning suddenly comes back again. The actual words of the ritual,
   of the liturgy, of the official doctrine, prove stronger than anything
   else. If a new religious idea cannot manage to make a radical breach
   with the past at the critical point--the rest may remain as it is--and
   procure itself a new "body," it cannot last; it disappears again. There
   is no tougher or more conservative fabric than a properly constituted
   religion; it can only yield to a higher phase by being abolished. No
   permanent effect, then, could be expected in the apostolic age from the
   twisting and turning of the law so as to make room for the new faith
   side by side with it, or so as to approximate the old religion to that
   faith. Someone had to stand up and say, "The old one is done away
   with"; he had to brand any further pursuit of it as a sin; he had to
   show that all things were become new. The man who did that was the
   apostle Paul, and it is in having done it that his greatness in the
   history of the world consists.

   Paul is the most luminous personality in the history of primitive
   Christianity, and yet opinions differ widely as to his true
   significance. Only a few years ago we had a leading Protestant
   theologian asserting that Paul's rabbinical theology led him to corrupt
   the Christian religion. Others, conversely, have called him the real
   founder of that religion. But in the opinion of the great majority of
   those who have studied him the true view is that he was the one who
   understood the Master and continued his work. This opinion is borne out
   by the facts. Those who blame him for corrupting the Christian religion
   have never felt a single breath of his spirit, and judge him only by
   mere externals, such as clothes and book-learning; those who extol or
   criticise him as a founder of religion are forced to make him bear
   witness against himself on the main point, and acknowledge that the
   consciousness which bore him up and steeled him for his work was
   illusory and self-deceptive. As we cannot want to be wiser than
   history, which knows him only as Christ's missionary, and as his own
   words clearly attest what his aims were and what he was, we regard him
   as Christ's disciple, as the apostle who not only worked harder but
   also accomplished more than all the rest put together.

   It was Paul who delivered the Christian religion from Judaism. We shall
   see how he did that if we consider the following points:--

   It was Paul who definitely conceived the Gospel as the message of the
   redemption already effected and of salvation now present. He preached
   the crucified and risen Christ, who gave us access to God and therewith
   righteousness and peace.

   It was he who confidently regarded the Gospel as a new force abolishing
   the religion of the law.

   It was he who perceived that religion in its new phase pertains to the
   individual and therefore to all individuals; and in this conviction,
   and with a full consciousness of what he was doing, he carried the
   Gospel to the nations of the world and transferred it from Judaism to
   the ground occupied by Greece and Rome. Not only are Greeks and Jews to
   unite on the basis of the Gospel, but the Jewish dispensation itself is
   now at an end. That the Gospel was transplanted from the East, where in
   subsequent ages it was never able to thrive properly, to the West, is a
   fact which we owe to Paul.

   It was he who placed the Gospel in the great scheme of spirit and
   flesh, inner and outer existence, death and life; he, born a Jew and
   educated a Pharisee, gave it a language, so that it became
   intelligible, not only to the Greeks but to all men generally, and
   united with the whole of the intellectual capital which had been
   amassed in previous ages.

   These are the factors that go to make the apostle's greatness in the
   history of religion. On their inner connexion I cannot here enter into
   any detail. But, in regard to the first of them, I may remind you of
   the words of the most important historian of religion in our day.
   Wellhausen declares that "Paul's especial work was to transform the
   Gospel of the kingdom into the Gospel of Jesus Christ, so that the
   Gospel is no longer the prophecy of the coming of the kingdom, but its
   actual fulfilment by Jesus Christ. In his view, accordingly, redemption
   from something in the future has become something which has already
   happened and is now present. He lays far more emphasis on faith than on
   hope; he anticipates the sense of future bliss in the present feeling
   of being God's son; he vanquishes death and already leads the new life
   on earth. He extols the strength which is made perfect in weakness; the
   grace of God is sufficient for him, and he knows that no power, present
   or future, can take him from His love, and that all things work
   together for good to them that love God." What knowledge, what
   confidence, what strength, was necessary to tear the new religion from
   its mother earth and plant it in an entirely new one! Islam,
   originating in Arabia, has remained the Arabian religion, no matter
   where it may have penetrated. Buddhism has at all times been at its
   purest in India. But this religion, born in Palestine, and confined by
   its founder to Jewish ground, in only a few years after his death was
   severed from that connexion. Paul put it in competition with the
   Israelitish religion: "Christ is the end of the law." Not only did it
   bear being thus rooted up and transplanted, but it showed that it was
   meant to be thus transplanted. It gave stay and support to the Roman
   Empire and the whole world of Western civilisation. If, as Renan justly
   observes, anyone had told the Roman Emperor in the first century that
   the little Jew who had come from Antioch as a missionary was his best
   collaborator, and would put the empire upon a stable basis, he would
   have been regarded as a madman, and yet he would have spoken nothing
   but the truth. Paul brought new forces to the Roman Empire, and laid
   the foundations of Western and Christian civilisation. Alexander the
   Great's work has perished; Paul's has remained. But if we praise the
   man who, without being able to appeal to a single word of his Master's,
   ventured upon the boldest enterprise, by the help of the spirit and
   with the letter against him, we must none the less pay the meed of
   honour to those personal disciples of Jesus who after a bitter internal
   struggle ultimately associated themselves with Paul's principles. That
   Peter did so we know for certain; of others we hear that they at least
   acknowledged their validity. It was, indeed, no insignificant
   circumstance that men in whose ears every word of their Master's was
   still ringing, and in whose recollection the concrete features of his
   personality were still a vivid memory--that these faithful disciples
   should recognise a pronouncement to be true which in important points
   seemed to depart from the original message and portended the downfall
   of the religion of Israel. What was kernel here, and what was husk,
   history has itself showed with unmistakable plainness, and by the
   shortest process. Husk were the whole of the Jewish limitations
   attaching to Jesus' message; husk were also such definite statements as
   "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel." In the
   strength of Christ's spirit the disciples broke through these barriers.
   It was his personal disciples not, as we might expect, the second or
   third generation, when the immediate memory of the Lord had already
   paled--who stood the great test. That is the most remarkable fact of
   the apostolic age.

   Without doing violence to the inner and essential features of the
   Gospel--unconditional trust in God as the Father of Jesus Christ,
   confidence in the Lord, forgiveness of sins, certainty of eternal life,
   purity and brotherly fellowship--Paul transformed it into the universal
   religion, and laid the ground for the great Church. But whilst the
   original limitations fell away, new ones of necessity made their
   appearance; and they modified the simplicity and the power of a
   movement which was from within. Before concluding our survey of the
   apostolic age, we must direct attention to these modifications.

   In the first place: the breach with the Synagogue and the founding of
   entirely independent religious communities had well-marked results.
   Whilst the idea was firmly maintained that the community of Christ, the
   "Church," was something suprasensible and heavenly, because it came
   from within, there was also a conviction that the Church took visible
   shape in every separate community. As a complete breach had taken
   place, or no connexion been established, with the ancient communion,
   the formation of entirely new societies was logically invested with a
   special significance, and excited the liveliest interest. In his
   sayings and parables Jesus, careless of all externals, could devote
   himself solely to the all-important point; but how and in what forms
   the seed would grow was not a question which occupied his mind; he had
   the people of Israel with their historical ordinances before him and
   was not thinking of external changes. But the connexion with this
   people was now severed, and no religious movement can remain in a
   bodiless condition. It must elaborate forms for common life and common
   public worship. Such forms, however, cannot be improvised; some of them
   take shape slowly out of concrete necessities; others are derived from
   the environment and from existing circumstances. It was in this way
   that the "Gentile" communities procured themselves an organism, a body.
   The forms which they developed were in part independent and gradual,
   and in part based upon the facts with which they had to deal.

   But a special measure of value always attaches to forms. By being the
   means by which the community is kept together, the value of that to
   which they minister is insensibly transferred to them; or, at least,
   there is always a danger of this happening. One reason for this is that
   the observance of the forms can always be controlled or enforced, as
   the case may be; whilst for the inner life there is no control that
   cannot be evaded.

   When the breach with the Jewish national communion had once taken
   place, there could be no doubt about the necessity for setting up a new
   community in opposition to it. The self-consciousness and strength of
   the Christian movement was displayed in the creation of a Church which
   knew itself to be the true Israel. But the founding of churches and
   "the Church" on earth brought an entirely new interest into the field;
   what came from within was joined by something that came from without;
   law, discipline, regulations for ritual and doctrine, were developed,
   and began to assert a position by a logic of their own. The measure of
   value applicable to religion itself no longer remained the only
   measure, and with a hundred invisible threads religion was insensibly
   worked into the net of history.

   In the second place: we have already referred to the fact that it was,
   above all, in his Christology that Paul's significance as a teacher
   consisted. In his view--we see this as well by the way in which he
   illuminated the death on the cross and the resurrection as by his
   equation, "the Lord is a Spirit"--the Redemption is already
   accomplished and salvation a present power. "God hath reconciled us to
   himself through Jesus Christ"; "If any man be in Christ, he is a new
   creature"; "Who shall separate us from the love of God?" The absolute
   character of the Christian religion is thus made clear. But it may also
   be observed in this connexion that every attempt to formulate a theory
   has a logic of its own and dangers of its own. There was one danger
   which the apostle himself had to combat, that of men claiming to be
   redeemed without giving practical proof of the new life. In the case of
   Jesus' sayings no such danger could arise, but Paul's formulas were not
   similarly protected. That men are not to rely upon "redemption,"
   forgiveness of sin, and justification, if the hatred of sin and the
   imitation of Christ be lacking, inevitably became in subsequent ages a
   standing theme with all earnest teachers. Who can fail to recognise
   that the doctrines of "objective redemption" have been the occasion of
   grievous temptations in the history of the Church, and for whole
   generations concealed the true meaning of religion? The conception of
   "redemption," which cannot be inserted in Jesus' teaching in this free
   and easy way at all, became a snare. No doubt it is true that
   Christianity is the religion of redemption; but the conception is a
   delicate one, and must never be taken out of the sphere of personal
   experience and inner reformation.

   But here we are met by a second danger closely connected with the
   first. If redemption is to be traced to. Christ's person and work,
   everything would seem to depend upon a right understanding of this
   person together with what he accomplished. The formation of a correct
   theory of and about Christ threatens to assume the position of chief
   importance, and to pervert the majesty and simplicity of the Gospel.
   Here, again, the danger is of a kind such as cannot arise with Jesus'
   sayings. Even in John we read: "If ye love me, keep my commandments."
   But with the way in which Paul defined the theory of religion, the
   danger can certainly arise and did arise. No long period elapsed before
   it was taught in the Church that the all-important thing is to know how
   the person of Jesus was constituted, what sort of physical nature he
   had, and so on. Paul himself is far removed from this position,--"Whoso
   calleth Christ Lord speaketh by the Holy Ghost,"--but the way in which
   he ordered his religious conceptions, as the outcome of his speculative
   ideas, unmistakably exercised an influence in a wrong direction. That,
   however great the attraction which his way of ordering them may possess
   for the understanding, it is a perverse proceeding to make Christology
   the fundamental substance of the Gospel is shown by Christ's teaching,
   which is everywhere directed to the all-important point, and summarily
   confronts every man with his God. This does not affect Paul's right to
   epitomise the Gospel in the message of Christ crucified, thus
   exhibiting God's power and God's wisdom, and in the love of Christ
   kindling the love of God. There are thousands to-day in whom the
   Christian faith is still propagated in the same manner, namely, through
   Christ. But to demand assent to a series of propositions about Christ's
   person is a different thing altogether.

   There is, however, another point to be considered here. Under the
   influence of the Messianic dogmas, and led by the impression which
   Christ made, Paul became the author of the speculative idea that not
   only was God in Christ, but that Christ himself was possessed of a
   peculiar nature of a heavenly kind. With the Jews, this was not a
   notion that necessarily shattered the framework of the Messianic idea;
   but with the Greeks it inevitably set an entirely new theory in motion.
   Christ's appearance in itself, the entrance of a divine being into the
   world, came of necessity to rank as the chief fact, as itself the real
   redemption. Paul did not, indeed, himself look upon it in this light;
   for him the crucial facts are the death on the cross and the
   resurrection, and he regards Christ's entrance into the world from an
   ethical point of view and as an example for us to follow "For our sakes
   he became poor"; he humbled himself and renounced the world. But this
   state of things could not last. The fact of redemption could not
   permanently occupy the second place; it was too large. But when moved
   into the first place it threatened the very existence of the Gospel, by
   drawing away men's thoughts and interests in another direction. When we
   look at the history of dogma, who can deny that that was what happened?
   To what extent it happened we shall see in the following lectures.

   In the third place: the new Church possessed a sacred book, the Old
   Testament. Paul, although he taught that the law had become of no
   avail, found a means of preserving the whole of the Old Testament. What
   a blessing to the Church this book has proved! As a book of
   edification, of consolation, of wisdom, of counsel, as a book of
   history, what an incomparable importance it has had for Christian life
   and apologetics! Which of the religions that Christianity encountered
   on Greek or Roman ground could boast of a similar book? Yet the
   possession of this book has not been an unqualified advantage to the
   Church. To begin with, there are many of its pages which exhibit a
   religion and a morality other than Christian. No matter how resolutely
   people tried to spiritualise it and give it an inner meaning by
   construing it in some special way, their efforts did not avail to get
   rid of the original sense in its entirety. There was always a danger of
   an inferior and obsolete principle forcing its way into Christianity
   through the Old Testament. This, indeed, was what actually occurred.
   Nor was it only in individual aspects that it occurred: the whole aim
   was changed. Moreover, on the new ground religion was intimately
   connected with a political power, namely, with nationality. How if
   people were seduced into again seeking such a connexion, not, indeed,
   with Judaism, but with a new nation, and not with ancient national
   laws, but with something of an analogous character? And when even a
   Paul here and there declared Old Testament laws to be still
   authoritative in spite of their having undergone an allegorical
   transformation, how could anyone restrain his successors from also
   proclaiming other laws, remodelled to suit the circumstances of the
   time, as valid ordinances of God? This brings us to the second point.
   Although whatever was drawn from the Old Testament by way of
   authoritative precept may have been inoffensive in substance, it was a
   menace to Christian freedom of both kinds. It threatened the freedom
   which comes from within, and also the freedom to form church
   communities and to arrange for public worship and discipline.

   I have tried to show that the limitations which surrounded the Gospel
   did not cease with the severance of the tie binding it to Judaism, but
   that, on the contrary, new limits made their appearance. They arose,
   however, just at the very points upon which the necessary progress of
   things depended, or, as the case might be, where an inalienable
   possession like the Old Testament was in question. Here, again, then,
   we are reminded of the fact that, so far as history is concerned, as
   soon as we leave the sphere of pure inwardness there is no progress, no
   achievement, no advantage of any sort that has not its dark side and
   does not bring its disadvantages with it. The apostle Paul complained
   that "we know in part." To a much greater degree is the same thing true
   of our actions and of everything connected with them. We have always to
   "pay the penalty" of acting, and not only take the evil consequences,
   but also knowingly and with open eyes resolutely neglect one thing in
   order to gain another. Our purest and most sacred possessions, when
   they leave the inward realm and pass into the world of form and
   circumstance, are no exception to the rule that the very shape which
   they take in action also proves to be their limitation.

   When the great apostle ended his life under Nero's axe in the year 64,
   he could say of himself what a short time before he had written to a
   faithful comrade: "I have finished my course; I have kept the faith."
   What missionary is there, what preacher, what man entrusted with the
   cure of souls, who can be compared with him, whether in the greatness
   of the task which he accomplished or in the holy energy with which he
   carried it out? He worked with the most living of all messages, and
   kindled a fire; he cared for his people like a father and strove for
   the souls of others with all the forces of his own; at the same time he
   discharged the duties of the teacher, the schoolmaster, the organiser.
   When he sealed his work by his death, the Roman Empire from Antioch as
   far as Rome, nay, as far as Spain, was planted with Christian
   communities. There were to be found in them few that were "mighty after
   the flesh" or of noble degree, and yet they were as "lights in the
   world," and on them the progress of the world's history rested. They
   had little "illumination," but they had acquired the faith in the
   living God and in a life eternal; they knew that the value of the human
   soul is infinite, and that its value is determined by relation to the
   invisible; they led a life of purity and brotherly fellowship, or at
   least strove after such a life. Bound together into a new people in
   Jesus Christ, their head, they were filled with the high consciousness
   that Jews and Greeks, Greeks and barbarians, would through them become
   one, and that the last and highest stage in the history of humanity had
   then been reached.

LECTURE XI

   THE apostolic age now lies behind us. We have seen that in the course
   of it the Gospel was detached from the mother soil of Judaism and
   placed upon the broad field of the Graeco-Roman Empire. The apostle
   Paul was the chief agent in accomplishing this work, and in thereby
   giving Christianity its place in the history of the world. The new
   connexion which it thus received did not in itself denote any
   restricted activity; on the contrary, the Christian religion was
   intended to be realised in mankind, and mankind at that time meant the
   orbis Romanus. But the new connexion involved the development of new
   forms, and new forms also meant limitation and encumbrance. We shall
   see more closely how this was effected if we consider

  THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT INTO CATHOLICISM

   The Gospel did not come into the world as a statutory religion, and
   therefore none of the forms in which it assumed intellectual and social
   expression--not even the earliest can be regarded as possessing a
   classical and permanent character. The historian must always keep this
   guiding idea before him when he undertakes to trace the course of the
   Christian religion through the centuries from the apostolic age
   downwards. As Christianity rises above all antitheses of the Here and
   the Beyond, life and death, work and the shunning of the world, reason
   and ecstasy, Hebraism and Hellenism, it can also exist under the most
   diverse conditions; just as it was originally amid the wreck of the
   Jewish religion that it developed its power. Not only can it so
   exist--it must do so, if it is to be the religion of the living and is
   itself to live. As a Gospel it has only one aim--the finding of the
   living God, the finding of Him by every individual as his God, and as
   the source of strength and joy and peace. How this aim is progressively
   realised through the centuries--whether with the coefficients of
   Hebraism or Hellenism, of the shunning of the world or of civilisation,
   of Gnosticism or of Agnosticism, of ecclesiastical institution or of
   perfectly free union, or by whatever other kinds of bark the core may
   be protected, the sap allowed to rise--is a matter that is of secondary
   moment, that is exposed to change, that belongs to the centuries, that
   comes with them and with them perishes.

   Now the greatest transformation which the new religion ever
   experienced--almost greater even than that which gave rise to the
   Gentile Church and thrust the Palestinian communities into the
   background--falls in the second century of our era, and therefore in
   the period which we shall consider in the present lecture.

   If we place ourselves at about the year 200, about a hundred or a
   hundred and twenty years after the apostolic age, not more than three
   or four generations had gone by since that age came to an end,--what
   kind of spectacle does the Christian religion offer?

   We see a great ecclesiastical and political community, and side by side
   with it numerous "sects" calling themselves Christian, but denied the
   name and bitterly opposed. That great ecclesiastical and political
   community presents itself as a league of individual communities
   spanning the empire from end to end. Although independent they are all
   constituted essentially alike, and interconnected by one and the same
   law of doctrine, and by fixed rules for the purposes of intercommunion.
   The law of doctrine seems at first sight to be of small scope, but all
   its tenets are of the widest significance; and together they embrace a
   profusion of metaphysical, cosmological, and historical problems, give
   them definite answers, and supply particulars of mankind's development
   from the creation up to its future form of existence. Jesus'
   injunctions for the conduct of life are not included in this law of
   doctrine; as the "rule of discipline" they were sharply distinguished
   from the "rule of faith." Each Church, however, also presents itself as
   an institution for public worship, where God is honoured in conformity
   with a solemn ritual. The distinction between priests and laymen is
   already a well-marked characteristic of this institution; certain acts
   of divine worship can be performed only by the priest; his mediation is
   an absolute necessity. It is only by mediation that a man can approach
   God at all, by the mediation of right doctrine, right ordinance, and a
   sacred book. The living faith seems to be transformed into a creed to
   be believed; devotion to Christ, into Christology; the ardent hope for
   the coming of "the kingdom," into a doctrine of immortality and
   deification; prophecy, into technical exegesis and theological
   learning; the ministers of the Spirit, into clerics; the brothers, into
   laymen in a state of tutelage; miracles and miraculous cures disappear
   altogether, or else are priestly devices; fervent prayers become solemn
   hymns and litanies; the "Spirit" becomes law and compulsion. At the
   same time individual Christians are in full touch with the life of the
   world, and the burning question is, "In how much of this life may I
   take part without losing my position as a Christian?" This enormous
   transformation took place within a hundred and twenty years. The first
   thing which we have to determine is, How did that happen? next, Did the
   Gospel succeed in holding its own amid this change, and how did it do
   so?

   Before, however, we try to answer these two questions, we must call to
   mind a piece of advice which no historian ought ever to neglect. Anyone
   who wants to determine the real value and significance of any great
   phenomenon or mighty product of history must first and foremost inquire
   into the work which it accomplished, or, as the case may be, into the
   problem which it solved. As every individual has a right to be judged,
   not by this or that virtue or defect, not by his talents or by his
   frailties, but by what he has done, so the great edifices of history,
   the states and the churches, must be estimated, first and foremost, we
   may perhaps say exclusively, by what they have achieved. It is the work
   done that forms the decisive test. With any other test we are involved
   in judgments of the vaguest kind, now optimistic, now pessimistic and
   mere historical twaddle. So here, too, in considering the Church as
   developed into Catholicism, we must first of all ask, In what did its
   work consist? What problem did it solve? What did it achieve? I will
   answer the last question first. It achieved two things: it waged war
   with nature-worship, polytheism, and political religion, and beat them
   back with great energy; and it exploded the dualistic philosophy of
   religion. Had the Church at the beginning of the third century been
   asked in tones of reproach, "How could you recede so far from where you
   began? To what have you come?" it might have answered: "Yes, it is to
   this that I have come: I have been obliged to discard much and admit
   much; I have had to fight--my body is full of scars, and my clothes are
   covered with dust; but I have won my battles and built my house; I have
   beaten back polytheism; I have disabled and almost annihilated that
   monstrous abortion, political religion; I have resisted the enticements
   of a subtle religious philosophy, and victoriously encountered it with
   God, the almighty Creator of all things; lastly, I have reared a great
   building, a fortress with towers and bulwarks, where I guard my
   treasure and protect the weak." This is the answer which the Church
   might have given, and truthfully given. But, someone may object, it was
   no great achievement to wage war with nature-worship and polytheism,
   and to beat them back; they had already rotted and decayed, and had
   little strength left. The objection does not hold. Many of the forms in
   which that species of religion had taken shape were, no doubt,
   antiquated and approaching extinction, but the religion itself, the
   religion of nature, was a mighty foe. It even still avails to beguile
   our souls and touch our heart-strings with effect, when an inspired
   prophet voices its message; how much more so then! The hymn to the Sun,
   giving life to all that lives, produced a profound and lifelong
   religious impression even upon a Goethe, and made him into a
   Sun-worshipper. But how overpowering it was in the days before science
   had banished the gods from nature! Christianity exploded the religion
   of nature,--exploded it not for this or that individual; that was
   already done,--but exploded it in the sense that there was now a large
   and compact community refuting nature-worship and polytheism by its
   impressive doctrines, and affording the deeper religious temper stay
   and support. And then political religion! Behind the imperial cult
   there was the whole power of the state, and to come to terms with it
   looked so safe and easy--yet the Church did not yield a single inch; it
   abolished the imperial system of state-idols. It was to place an
   irremovable landmark between religion and politics, between God and
   Caesar, that the martyrs shed their blood. Lastly, in an age that was
   deeply moved by questions of religious philosophy, the Church
   maintained a firm front against all the speculative ideas of dualism;
   and, although these ideas often seemed to approximate closely to its
   own position, it passionately met them with the monotheistic view. The
   struggle here, however, was rendered all the harder by the fact that
   many Christians--and just the very prominent and gifted ones too--made
   common cause with the enemy, and themselves embraced the dualistic
   theory. The Church stood firm. If we recollect that, in spite of these
   counter-movements against the Graeco-Roman spirit, it also managed to
   attach this very spirit to itself--otherwise than Judaism, of whose
   dealings with the Greek world the saying holds, "You had power to draw
   but not to keep me"; if we recollect, further, that it was in the
   second century that the foundations of the whole of the ecclesiastical
   system prevailing up to the present day were laid, we can only be
   astonished at the greatness of the work which was then achieved.

   We now return to the two questions which we raised: How was this great
   transformation accomplished? and, Did the Gospel hold its own amid this
   change, or, if so, how?

   There were, if I am not mistaken, three leading forces engaged in
   bringing about this great revolution, and effecting the organisation of
   new forms. The first of these forces tallies with the universal law in
   the history of religion, for in every religious development we find it
   at work. When the second and third generations after the founding of a
   new religion have passed away; when hundreds, nay, thousands, have
   become its adherents, no longer through conversion but by the
   influences of tradition and of birth, despite Tertullian's saying:
   fiunt, non nascuntur Christiani; when those who have laid hold upon the
   faith as great spoil are joined by crowds of others who wrap it round
   them like an outer garment, a revolution always occurs. The religion of
   strong feeling and of the heart passes into the religion of custom and
   therefore of form and of law. A new religion may be instituted with the
   greatest vigour, the utmost enthusiasm, and a tremendous amount of
   inner emotion; it may at the same time lay ever so much stress on
   spiritual freedom--where was all this ever more powerfully expressed
   than in Paul's teaching?--and yet, even though believers be forced to
   be celibates and only adults be received, the process of solidifying
   and codifying the religion is bound to follow. Its forms then at once
   stiffen; in the very process of stiffening they receive for the first
   time a real significance, and new forms are added. Not only do they
   acquire the value of laws and regulations, but they come to be
   insensibly regarded as though they contained within them the very
   substance of religion; nay, as though they were themselves that
   substance. This is the way in which people who do not feel religion to
   be a reality are compelled to regard it, for otherwise they would have
   nothing at all; and this is the way in which those who continue really
   to live in it are compelled to handle it, or else they would be unable
   to exercise any influence upon others. The former are not by any means
   necessarily hypocrites. Real religion, of course, is a closed book to
   them; its most important element has evaporated. But there are various
   points of view from which a man may still be able to appreciate
   religion without living in it. He may appreciate it as discharging the
   functions of morality, or of police; above all he may appreciate it on
   aesthetic grounds. When the Romanticists re-introduced Catholicism into
   Germany and France at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
   Chateaubriand, more especially, was never tired of singing its praises
   and fancied that he had all the feelings of a Catholic. But an acute
   critic remarked that Monsieur Chateaubriand was mistaken in his
   feelings; he thought that he was a true Catholic, while as a matter of
   fact he was only standing before the ancient ruin of the Church and
   exclaiming: "How beautiful!" That is one of the ways in which a man can
   appreciate a religion without being an inward adherent of it; but there
   are many others, and, amongst them, some in which a nearer approach is
   made to its true substance. All of them, however, have this much in
   common, that any actual experience of religion is no longer felt, or
   felt only in an uncertain and intermittent way. Conversely, a high
   regard is paid to the outward shows and influences connected with it,
   and they are carefully maintained. Whatever finds expression in
   doctrines, regulations, ordinances, and forms of public worship comes
   to be treated as the thing itself. This, then, is the first force at
   work in the transformation: the original enthusiasm, in the large sense
   of the word, evaporates, and the religion of law and form at once
   arises.

   But not only did an original element evaporate in the course of the
   second century: another was introduced. Even had this youthful religion
   not severed the tie which bound it to Judaism, it would have been
   inevitably affected by the spirit and the civilisation of that
   Graeco-Roman world on whose soil it was permanently settled. But to how
   much greater an extent was it exposed to the influence of this spirit
   after being sharply severed from the Jewish religion and the Jewish
   nation. It hovered bodiless over the earth like a being of the air;
   bodiless and seeking a body. The spirit, no doubt, makes to itself its
   own body, but it does so by assimilating what is around it. The influx
   of Hellenism, of the Greek spirit, and the union of the Gospel with it,
   form the greatest fact in the history of the Church in the second
   century, and when the fact was once established as a foundation it
   continued through the following centuries. In the influence of
   Hellenism on the Christian religion three stages may be distinguished,
   and a preliminary stage as well. We have already mentioned the
   preliminary stage in a previous lecture. It is to be found in the
   circumstances in which the Gospel arose, and it formed a very condition
   of its appearance. Not until Alexander the Great had created an
   entirely new position of affairs, and the barriers separating the
   nations of the East from one another and from Hellenism had been
   destroyed, could Judaism free itself from its limitations and start
   upon its development into a religion for the world. The time was ripe
   when a man in the East could also breathe the air of Greece and see his
   spiritual horizon stretch beyond the limits of his own nation. Yet we
   cannot say that the earliest Christian writings, let alone the Gospel,
   show, to any considerable extent, the presence of a Greek element. If
   we are to look for it anywhere--apart from certain well-marked traces
   of it in Paul, Luke, and John--it must be in the possibility of the new
   religion appearing at all. We cannot enter further upon this question
   here. The first stage of any real influx of definitely Greek thought
   and Greek life is to be fixed at about the year 130. It was then that
   the religious philosophy of Greece began to effect an entrance, and it
   went straight to the centre of the new religion. It sought to get into
   inner touch with Christianity, and, conversely, Christianity itself
   held out a hand to this ally. We are speaking of Greek philosophy; as
   yet, there is no trace of mythology, Greek worship, and so on; all that
   was taken up into the Church, cautiously and under proper guarantees,
   was the great capital which philosophy had amassed since the days of
   Socrates. A century or so later, about the year 220 or 230, the second
   stage begins: Greek mysteries, and Greek civilisation in the whole
   range of its development, exercise their influence on the Church, but
   not mythology and polytheism; these were still to come. Another
   century, however, had in its turn to elapse before Hellenism as a whole
   and in every phase of its development was established in the Church.
   Guarantees, of course, are not lacking here either, but for the most
   part they consist only in a change of label; the thing itself is taken
   over without alteration, and in the worship of the saints we see a
   regular Christian religion of a lower order arising. We are here
   concerned, however, not with the second and third stages, but only with
   that influx of the Greek spirit which was marked by the absorption of
   Greek philosophy and, particularly, of Platonism. Who can deny that
   elements here came together which stood in elective affinity? So much
   depth and delicacy of feeling, so much earnestness and dignity,
   and--above all--so strong a monotheistic piety were displayed in the
   religious ethics of the Greeks, acquired as it had been by hard toil on
   a basis of inner experience and metaphysical speculation, that the
   Christian religion could not pass this treasure by with indifference.
   There was much in it, indeed, which was defective and repellent; there
   was no personality visibly embodying its ethics as a living power; it
   still kept up a strange connexion with "demon-worship" and polytheism;
   but both as a whole and in its individual parts it was felt to contain
   a kindred element, and it was absorbed.

   But besides the Greek ethics there was also a cosmological conception
   which the Church took over at this time, and which was destined in a
   few decades to attain a commanding position in its doctrinal
   system--the Logos. Starting from an examination of the world and the
   life within, Greek thought had arrived at the conception of an active
   central idea--by what stages we need not here mention. This central
   idea represented the unity of the supreme principle of the world, of
   thought, and of ethics; but it also represented, at the same time, the
   divinity itself as a creative and active, as distinguished from a
   quiescent, power. The most important step that was ever taken in the
   domain of Christian doc trine was when the Christian apologists at the
   beginning of the second century drew the equation: the Logos = Jesus
   Christ. Ancient teachers before them had also called Christ "the Logos"
   among the many predicates which they ascribed to him; nay, one of them,
   John, had already formulated the proposition: "The Logos is Jesus
   Christ." But with John this proposition had not become the basis of
   every speculative idea about Christ; with him, too, "the Logos" was
   only a predicate. But now teachers came forward who previous to their
   conversion had been adherents of the platonico-stoical philosophy, and
   with whom the conception "Logos" formed an inalienable part of a
   general philosophy of the world. They proclaimed that Jesus Christ was
   the Logos incarnate, which had hitherto been revealed only in the great
   effects which it exercised. In the place of the entirely unintelligible
   conception "Messiah," an intelligible one was acquired at a stroke;
   Christology, tottering under the exuberance of its own affirmations,
   received a stable basis; Christ's significance for the world was
   established; his mysterious relation to God was explained; the cosmos,
   reason, and ethics were comprehended as one. It was, indeed, a
   marvellous formula; and was not the way prepared for it, nay, hastened,
   by the speculative ideas about the Messiah propounded by Paul and other
   ancient teachers? The knowledge that the divine in Christ must be
   conceived as the Logos opened up a number of problems, and at the same
   time set them definite limits and gave them definite directives.
   Christ's unique character as opposed to all rivals appeared to be
   established in the simplest fashion, and yet the conception provided
   thought with so much liberty and free play that Christ could be
   regarded, as the need might arise, on the one side as operative deity
   itself, and on the other as still the first-born among many brethren
   and as the first created of God.

   What a proof it is of the impression which Christ's teaching created
   that Greek philosophers managed to identify him with the Logos! For the
   assertion that the incarnation of the Logos had taken place in an
   historical personage there had been no preparation. No philosophising
   Jew had ever thought of identifying the Messiah with the Logos; no
   Philo, for instance, ever entertained the idea of such an equation! It
   gave a metaphysical significance to an historical fact; it drew into
   the domain of cosmology and religious philosophy a person who had
   appeared in time and space; but by so distinguishing one person it
   raised all history to the plane of the cosmical movement.

   The identification of the Logos with Christ was the determining factor
   in the fusion of Greek philosophy with the apostolic inheritance and
   led the more thoughtful Greeks to adopt the latter. Most of us regard
   this identification as inadmissible, because the way in which we
   conceive the world and ethics does not point to the existence of any
   Logos at all. But a man must be blind not to see that for that age the
   appropriate formula for uniting the Christian religion with Greek
   thought was the Logos. Nor is it difficult even to-day to attach a
   valid meaning to the conception. An unmixed blessing it has not been.
   To a much larger extent than the earlier speculative ideas about Christ
   it absorbed men's interest; it withdrew their minds from the simplicity
   of the Gospel, and increasingly transformed it into a philosophy of
   religion. The proposition that the Logos had appeared among men had an
   intoxicating effect, but the enthusiasm and transport which it produced
   in the soul did not lead with any certainty to the God whom Jesus
   Christ proclaimed.

   The loss of an original element and the gain of a fresh one, namely,
   the Greek, are insufficient to explain the great change which the
   Christian religion experienced in the second century. We must bear in
   mind, thirdly, the great struggle which that religion was then carrying
   on within its own domain. Parallel with the slow influx of the element
   of Greek philosophy, experiments were being made all along the line in
   the direction of what may be briefly called "acute Hellenisation."
   While they offer us a most magnificent historical spectacle, in the
   period itself they were a terrible danger. More than any before it, the
   second century is the century of religious fusion, of "Theocrasia." The
   problem was to include Christianity in this religious fusion, as one
   element among others, although the chief. The "Hellenism" which made
   this endeavour had already attracted to itself all the mysteries, all
   the philosophy of Eastern worship, elements the most sublime and the
   most absurd, and by the never-failing aid of philosophical, that is to
   say, of allegorical interpretation, had spun them all into a glittering
   web. It now fell upon--I cannot help so expressing it--the Christian
   religion. It was impressed by the sublime character of this religion;
   it did reverence to Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world; it
   offered to give up everything that it possessed--all the treasures of
   its civilisation and its wisdom--to this message, if only the message
   would suffer them to stand. As though endowed with the right to rule,
   the message was to make its entry into a ready-made theory of the world
   and religion, and into mysteries already prepared for it. What a proof
   of the impression which this message made, and what a temptation! This
   "Gnosticism,"--such is the name which the movement has
   received,--strong and active in the plenitude of its religious
   experiments, established itself under Christ's name, developed a
   vigorous and abiding feeling for many Christian ideas, sought to give
   shape to what was still shapeless, to settle accounts with what was
   externally incomplete, and to bring the whole stream of the Christian
   movement into its own channel. The majority of the faithful, led by
   their bishops, so far from yielding to these enticements, took up the
   struggle with them in the conviction that they masked a demonic
   temptation. But struggle in this case meant definition, that is to say,
   drawing a sharp line of demarcation around what was Christian and
   declaring everything heathen that would not keep within it. The
   struggle with Gnosticism compelled the Church to put its teaching, its
   worship, and its discipline into fixed forms and ordinances, and to
   exclude everyone who would not yield them obedience. In the conviction
   that it was everywhere only conserving and honouring what had been
   handed down, it never for a moment doubted that the obedience which it
   demanded was anything more than subjection to the divine will itself,
   and that in the doctrines with which it encountered the enemy it was
   exhibiting the impress of religion itself.

   If by "Catholic" we mean the church of doctrine and of law, then the
   Catholic Church had its origin in the struggle with Gnosticism. It had
   to pay a heavy price for the victory which kept that tendency at bay;
   we may almost say that the vanquished imposed their terms upon the
   victor: Victi victoribus legem dederunt. It kept Dualism and the acute
   phase of Hellenism at bay; but by becoming a community with a fully
   worked-out scheme of doctrine, and a definite form of public worship,
   it was of necessity compelled to take on forms analogous to those which
   it combated in the Gnostics. To encounter our enemy's theses by setting
   up others one by one is to change over to his ground. How much of its
   original freedom the Church sacrificed! It was now forced to say: You
   are no Christian, you cannot come into any relation with God at all,
   unless you have first of all acknowledged these doctrines, yielded
   obedience to these ordinances, and followed out definite forms of
   mediation. Nor was anyone to think a religious experience legitimate
   that had not been sanctioned by sound doctrine and approved by the
   priests. The Church found no other way and no other means of
   maintaining itself against Gnosticism, and what was set up as a
   protection against enemies from without became the palladium, nay, the
   very foundation, within. This entire development, it is true, would
   probably have taken place apart from the struggle in question,--the two
   elements which we first discussed would have produced it; but that it
   took place so rapidly and assumed so positive, nay, so Draconian, a
   shape, was due to the fact that the struggle was one in which the very
   existence of the traditional religion was at stake. The superficial
   view that the personal ambition of certain individuals was at the
   bottom of the whole system of established ordinance and priesthood is
   absolutely untenable. The loss of the original, living element is by
   itself sufficient to explain the phenomena. La médiocrité fonde
   l'autorité. It is the man who knows religion only as usage and
   obedience that creates the priest, for the purpose of ridding himself
   of an essential part of the obligations which he feels by loading him
   with them. He also makes ordinances, for the semi-religious prefer an
   ordinance to a Gospel.

   We have endeavoured to indicate the tendencies by which the great
   change was effected. It remains to answer the second question: Did the
   Gospel hold its own amid the change, and, if so, how? That it entered
   upon an entirely new set of circumstances is already obvious; but we
   shall have to study them more closely.

LECTURE XII

   NO one can compare the internal state of Christendom at the beginning
   of the third century with the state in which it found itself a hundred
   and twenty years earlier without being moved by conflicting views and
   sentiments. Admiration for the vigorous achievement presented in the
   creation of the Catholic Church, and for the energy with which it
   extended its activity in all directions, is balanced by concern at the
   absence of those many elements of freedom and directness, united,
   however, by an inward bond, which the primitive age possessed. Although
   we are compelled gratefully to acknowledge that this Church repelled
   all attempts to let the Christian religion simply dissolve into
   contemporary thought, and protected itself against the acute phase of
   Hellenisation, still we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that it had to
   pay a high price for maintaining its position. Let us determine a
   little more precisely what the alteration was which was effected in it,
   and on which we have already touched.

   The first and most prominent change is the way in which freedom and
   independence in matters of religion are endangered. No one is to feel
   and count himself a Christian, that is to say, a child of God, who has
   not previously subjected his religious knowledge and experience to the
   controlling influence of the Church's creed. The "Spirit" is confined
   within the narrowest limits, and forbidden to work where and as it
   will. Nay, more; not only is the individual, except in special cases,
   to begin by being a minor and by obeying the Church; he is never to
   become of full age, that is to say, he is never to lose his dependence
   on doctrine, on the priest, on public worship, and on the "book." It
   was then that what we still specifically call the Catholic form of
   godliness, in contrast with Evangelicalism, originated. A blow was
   dealt to the direct and immediate element in religion; and for any
   individual to restore it afresh for himself became a matter of
   extraordinary difficulty.

   Secondly, although the acute phase of Hellenisation was avoided,
   Christendom became more and more penetrated by the Greek and
   philosophical idea that true religion is first and foremost "doctrine,"
   and doctrine, too, that is coextensive with the whole range of
   knowledge. That this faith of "slaves and old women" attracted to
   itself the entire philosophy of God and the world which the Greeks had
   formed, and undertook to recast that philosophy as though teaching it
   were part of its own substance and unite it with the teaching of Jesus
   Christ, was certainly a proof of the inner power of the Christian
   religion; but the process involved, as a necessary consequence, a
   displacement of the fundamental religious interest, and the addition of
   an enormous burden. The question, "What must I do to be saved?" which
   in Jesus Christ's and the apostles' day could still receive a very
   brief answer, now evoked a most diffuse one; and even though in view of
   the laymen shorter replies might still be provided, the laymen were in
   so far regarded as imperfect, and expected to observe a submissive
   attitude towards the learned. The Christian religion had already
   received that tendency to Intellectualism which has clung to it ever
   since. But when thus presented as a huge and complex fabric, as a vast
   and difficult system of doctrine, not only is it encumbered, but its
   earnest character threatens to disappear. This character depends upon
   the emotional and gladdening element in it being kept directly
   accessible. The Christian religion is assuredly informed with the
   desire to come to terms with all knowledge and with intellectual life
   as a whole; but when achievements in this field--even presuming that
   they always accord with truth and reality--are held to be equally
   binding with the evangelical message, or even to be a necessary
   preliminary to it, mischief is done to the cause of religion. This
   mischief is already unmistakably present at the beginning of the third
   century.

   Thirdly, the Church obtained a special, independent value as an
   institution; it became a religious power. Originally only a developed
   form of that community of brothers which furnished place and manner for
   God's common worship and a mysterious shadow of the heavenly Church, it
   now became, as an institution, an indispensable factor in religion.
   People were taught that in this institution Christ's Spirit had
   deposited everything that the individual man can need; that he is
   wholly bound to it, therefore, not only in love but also in faith; that
   it is there only that the Spirit works, and therefore there only that
   all its gifts of grace are to be found. That the individual Christian
   who did not subordinate himself to the ecclesiastical institution
   relapsed, as a rule, into heathenism, and fell into false and evil
   doctrines or an immoral life, was, indeed, an actual fact. The effect
   of this, combined with the struggle against the Gnostics, was that the
   institution, together with all its forms and arrangements, became more
   and more identified with the "bride of Christ," "the true Jerusalem,"
   and so on, and accordingly was even itself proclaimed as the inviolable
   creation of God, and the fixed and unalterable abode of the Holy Ghost.
   Consistently with this, it began to announce that all its ordinances
   were equally sacred. How greatly religious liberty was thus encumbered
   I need not show.

   Fourthly and lastly, the Gospel was not proclaimed as the glad message
   with the same vigour in the second century as it had been in the first.
   The reasons for this are manifold: on the one hand personal experience
   of religion was not felt so strongly as Paul, or as the author of the
   fourth Gospel, felt it; on the other, the prevalent eschatological
   expectations, which those teachers had restrained by their more
   profound teaching, remained in full sway. Fear and hope are more
   prominent in the Christianity of the second century than they are with
   Paul, and it is only in appearance that the former stands near to
   Jesus' sayings; for, as we saw, God's Fatherhood is the main article in
   Jesus' message. But, as Romans viii. proves, the knowledge of this
   truth is just what Paul embodied in his preaching of the faith. While
   the element of fear thus obtained a larger scope in the Christianity of
   the second century,--this scope increased in proportion as the original
   buoyancy died down and conformity to the world extended,--the ethical
   element became less free and more a matter of law and rigorism. In
   religion, rigorism always forms the obverse side of secularity. But as
   it appeared impossible to expect a rigoristic ethics of everyone, the
   distinction between a perfect and a sufficient morality already set in
   as an element in the growth of Catholicism. That the roots of this
   distinction go further back is a fact of which we need not here take
   account; it was only towards the end of the second century that the
   distinction became a fatal one. Born of necessity and erected into a
   virtue, it soon grew so important that the existence of Christianity as
   a Catholic Church came to depend upon it. The uniformity of the
   Christian ideal was thereby disturbed and a quantitative view of moral
   achievement suggested which is unknown to the Gospel. The Gospel does,
   no doubt, make a distinction between a strong and a weak faith, and
   greater and smaller moral achievements; but he that is least in the
   kingdom of God may be perfect in his kind.

   These various tendencies together denote the essential changes which
   the Christian religion experienced up to the beginning of the third
   century, and by which it was modified. Did the Gospel hold its own in
   spite of them, and how may that be shown? Well, we can cite a whole
   series of documents, which, so far as written words can attest inner
   and genuinely Christian life, bear very clear and impressive testimony
   that such life existed. Martyrdoms like those of Perpetua and
   Felicitas, or letters passing between communities, like those from
   Lyons to Asia Minor, exhibit the Christian faith and the strength and
   delicacy of moral sentiment with a splendour only paralleled in the
   days when the faith was founded; while of all that had been done in the
   external development of the Church they make no mention whatever. The
   way to God is found with certainty, and the simplicity of the life
   within does not appear to be disturbed or encumbered. Again, let us
   take a writer like the Christian religious philosopher, Clement of
   Alexandria, who flourished about the year 200. We can still feel from
   his writings that this scholar, although he was absolutely steeped in
   speculative ideas, and as a thinker reduced the Christian religion to a
   boundless sea of "doctrines,"--a Greek in every fibre of his
   being,--won peace and joy from the Gospel, and he can also express what
   he won and testify of the power of the living God. It is as a new man
   that he appears, one who has pressed on through the whole range of
   philosophy, through authority and speculation, through all the
   externals of religion, to the glorious liberty of the children of God.
   His faith in Providence, his faith in Christ, his doctrine of freedom,
   his ethics--everything is expressed in language that betrays the Greek,
   and yet everything is new and genuinely Christian. Further, if we
   compare him with a Christian of quite another stamp, namely, his
   contemporary, Tertullian, it is easy to show that what they have in
   common in religion is what they have learned from the Gospel, nay, is
   the Gospel itself. And in reading Tertullian's exposition of the Lord's
   Prayer, and turning it over in our minds, we see that this hot-blooded
   African, this stern foe of heretics, this resolute champion of
   auctoritas and ratio, this dogmatic advocate, this man at once
   Churchman and enthusiast, nevertheless possessed a deep feeling for the
   main substance of the Gospel and a good knowledge of it as well. In
   this Old-Catholic Church the Gospel, truly, was not as yet stifled!

   Further, this Church still kept up the all-important idea that the
   Christian community must present itself as a society of brothers active
   in work, and it gave expression to this idea in a way that puts
   subsequent generations to shame.

   Lastly, there can be no doubt--and while so truth-loving a man as
   Origen confirms the fact for us, heathen writers like Lucian also
   attest it--that the hope of an eternal life, the full confidence in
   Christ, a readiness to make sacrifices, and a purity of morals were
   still, in spite of all frailties--here, too, not lacking,--the real
   characteristics of this society. Origen can challenge his heathen
   opponents to compare any community whatever with the Christian
   community, and to say where the greater moral excellence lies. This
   religion had, no doubt, already developed a husk and integument; to
   penetrate through to it and grasp the kernel had become more difficult;
   it had also lost much of its original life. But the gifts and the tasks
   which the Gospel offered still remained in force, and the fabric which
   the Church had erected around them also served many a man as the means
   by which he attained to the thing itself.

   We now pass to the consideration of

  THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN GREEK CATHOLICISM

   I must invite you to descend several centuries with me and to look at
   the Greek Church as it is today, and as it has been preserved,
   essentially unaltered, for more than a thousand years. Between the
   third and the nineteenth century the history of the Church of the East
   nowhere presents any deep gulf. Hence we may take up our position in
   the present. Here, in turn, we ask the three following questions:

   What did this Greek Catholicism achieve?

   What are its characteristics?

   What modifications did the Gospel here undergo, and how did it hold its
   own?

   What did this Greek Catholicism achieve? Two facts may be cited on this
   point: firstly, in the great domain which it embraces, the countries of
   the eastern part of the Mediterranean and northwards to the Arctic
   Ocean, it made an end of heathenism and polytheism. The decisive
   victory was accomplished from the third to the sixth century, and so
   effectually accomplished that the gods of Greece really
   perished--perished unwept and unmourned. Not in any great battle did
   they die, but from sheer exhaustion, and without offering any
   resistance worth mention. I may just point out that before dying they
   transferred a considerable portion of their power to the Church's
   saints. But, what is more important, with the death of the gods
   Neoplatonism, the last great product of Greek philosophy, was also
   vanquished. The religious philosophy of the Church proved the stronger.
   The victory over Hellenism is an achievement of the Eastern Church on
   which it still subsists. Secondly, this Church managed to effect such a
   fusion with the individual nations which it drew into its bosom that
   religion and church became to them national palladia, nay, palladia
   pure and simple. Go amongst Greeks, Russians, Armenians, etc., and you
   will everywhere find that religion and nationality are inseparable, and
   the one element exists only in and alongside of the other. Men of these
   nationalities will, if need be, suffer themselves to be cut in pieces
   for their religion. This is no mere consequence of the pressure
   exercised by the hostile power of Mohammedanism; the Russians are not
   subject to this pressure. Nor is it only--shall I say?--in the Moscow
   press that we can see what a firm and intimate connexion exists between
   Church and nation in these peoples, in spite of "sects," which are not
   wanting here either; to convince ourselves of it we must read--to take
   an instance at random--Tolstoi's Village Tales. They bring before the
   reader a really touching picture of the deep influence of the Church,
   with its message of the Eternal, of self-sacrifice, of sympathy and
   fraternity, on the national mind. That the clergy stand low in the
   social scale, and frequently encounter contempt, must not delude us
   into supposing that as the representatives of the Church they do not
   occupy an incomparably high station. In Eastern Europe the monastic
   ideal is deeply rooted in the national soul.

   But the mention of these two points includes everything that can be
   said about the achievements of this Church. To add that it has
   disseminated a certain amount of culture would involve pitching our
   standard of culture very low. In comparison with Islam, too, it is no
   longer so successful in doing what it has done in the past and still
   does in regard to polytheism. The missions of the Russian Church are
   still overthrowing polytheism even today; but large territories have
   been lost to Islam, and the Church has not recovered them. Islam has
   extended its victories as far as the Adriatic and in the direction of
   Bosnia. It has won over numerous Albanian and Slav tribes which were
   once Christian. It shows itself to be at least a match for the Church,
   although we must not forget that in the heart of its dominions there
   are Christian nations who have maintained their creed.

   Our second question was, What are the characteristics of this Church?
   The answer is not easy; for as it presents itself to the spectator this
   Church is a highly complex structure. The feelings, the superstitions,
   the learning, and the devotional philosophy of hundreds, nay, of
   thousands of years, are built into it. But, further; no one can look at
   this Church from outside, with its forms of worship, its solemn ritual,
   the number of its ceremonies, its relics, pictures, priests, monks, and
   the philosophy of its mysteries, and then compare it on the one hand
   with the Church of the first century, and on the other with the
   Hellenic cults in the age of Neoplatonism, without arriving at the
   conclusion that it belongs not to the former but to the latter. It
   takes the form, not of a Christian product in Greek dress, but of a
   Greek product in Christian dress. It would have done battle with the
   Christians of the first century just as it did battle with the worship
   of Magna Mater and Zeus Soter. There are innumerable features of this
   Church which are counted as sacred as the Gospel, and towards which not
   even a tendency existed in primitive Christianity. Of the whole
   performance of the chief religious service, nay, even of many of the
   dogmas, the same thing may, in the last resort, be said: if certain
   words, like "Christ," etc., are omitted, there is nothing left to
   recall the original element. In its external form as a whole this
   Church is nothing more than a continuation of the history of Greek
   religion under the alien influence of Christianity, parallel to the
   many other alien influences which have affected it. We might also
   describe it as the natural product of the union between Hellenism,
   itself already in a state of oriental decay, and Christian teaching; it
   is the transformation which history effects in a religion by "natural"
   means, and, as was here the case, was bound to effect between the third
   and the sixth century. In this sense it is a natural religion. The
   conception admits of a double meaning. It is generally understood as an
   abstract term covering all the elementary feelings and processes
   traceable in every religion. Whether there are any such elements, or,
   on the other hand, whether they are sufficiently stable and articulate
   to be followed as a whole, admits, however, of a doubt. The conception
   "natural religion" may be better applied to the growth which a religion
   produces when the "natural" forces of history have ceased playing on
   it. At bottom these forces are everywhere the same, although differing
   in the way in which they are mounted. They mould religion until it
   answers their purpose; not by expelling what is sacred, venerable, and
   so on, but by assigning it the place and allowing it the scope which
   they consider right. They immerse everything in a uniform medium,--that
   medium which, like the air, is the first condition of their "natural"
   existence. In this sense, then, the Greek Church is a natural religion;
   no prophet, no reformer, no genius, has arisen in its history since the
   third century to disturb the ordinary process by which a religion
   becomes naturalised into common history. The process attained its
   completion in the sixth century and asserted itself victoriously
   against severe assaults in the eighth and ninth. The Church has since
   been at rest, and no further essential, nay, not even any unessential,
   change has taken place in the condition which it then reached. Since
   then, apparently, the nations belonging to this Church have undergone
   nothing to make it seem intolerable to them and to call for any reform
   in it. They still continue, then, in this "natural" religion of the
   sixth century.

   I have, however, advisedly spoken of the Church in its external form.
   Its complex character is partly due to the fact that we cannot arrive
   at its inner condition by simple deduction from its outer. It is not
   sufficient to observe, although the observation is correct, that this
   Church is part of the history of Greek religion. It exercises
   influences which from this point of view are not easily intelligible.
   We cannot form a correct estimate of it unless we dwell more closely on
   the factors which lend it its character.

   The first factor which we encounter is tradition, and the observance of
   it. The sacred and the divine do not exist in free action,--we shall
   see later to what reservations this statement is subject,--but are put,
   as it were, into a storehouse, in the form of an immense capital. The
   capital is to provide for all demands, and to be coined in the precise
   way in which the Fathers coined it. Here, it is true, we have an idea
   which can be traced to something already existing in the primitive age.
   We read in the Acts of the Apostles that "they continued steadfastly in
   the apostles' doctrine." But what became of this practice and this
   obligation? Firstly, everything was designated "apostolic" which was
   deposited in this Church in the course of the succeeding centuries; or,
   rather, what the Church considered necessary to possess in order to
   suit the historical position in which it was placed it called
   apostolic, because it fancied that otherwise it could not exist, and
   what is necessary for the Church's existence must be simply apostolic.
   Secondly, it has been established as an irrefragable fact that the
   "continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine" applies, first and
   foremost, to the punctilious observance of every direction as to
   ritual: the sacred element is bound up with text and form. Both are
   conceived in a thoroughly antique way. That the divine is, so to speak,
   stored up as though it were an actual commodity, and that the supreme
   demand which the Deity makes is the punctilious observance of a ritual,
   were ideas that in antiquity were perfectly familiar and admitted of no
   doubt. Tradition and ceremony are the conditions under which the Holy
   alone existed and was accessible. Obedience, respect, reverence, were
   the most important religious feelings. Whilst they are doubtless
   inalienable features of religion, it is only as accompaniments of an
   active feeling quite different in its character that they possess any
   value, and that further presumes that the object to which they are
   directed is a worthy one. Traditionalism and the ritualism so closely
   connected with it are prominent characteristics of the Greek Church,
   but this is just what shows how far it has departed from the Gospel.

   The second point that fixes the character of this Church is the value
   which it attaches to orthodoxy, to sound doctrine. It has stated and
   re-stated its doctrines with the greatest precision and often enough
   made them a terror to men of different creed. No one, it claims, can be
   saved who does not possess the correct doctrine; the man who does not
   possess it is to be expelled and must forfeit all his rights; if he be
   a fellow-countryman, he must be treated as a leper and lose all
   connexion with his nation. This fanaticism, which still flares up here
   and there in the Greek Church even to-day, and in principle has not
   been abandoned, is not Greek, although a certain inclination towards it
   was not lacking in the ancient Greeks; still less did it originate in
   Roman law; it is the result, rather, of an unfortunate combination of
   several factors. When the Roman Empire became Christian, the hard fight
   for existence which the Church had waged with the Gnostics was not yet
   forgotten; still less had the Church forgotten the last bloody
   persecutions which the State had inflicted upon it in a kind of
   despair. These two circumstances would in themselves be sufficient to
   explain how the Church came to feel that it had a right of reprisal,
   and was at the same time bound to suppress heretics. But, in addition,
   there had now appeared in the highest place, since the days of
   Diocletian and Constantine, the absolutist conception, derived from the
   East, of the unlimited right and the unlimited duty of the ruler in
   regard to his "subjects." The unfortunate factor in the great change
   was that the Roman Emperor was at once, and almost in the same moment,
   a Christian emperor and an Oriental despot. The more conscientious he
   was, the more intolerant he was bound to be; for the Deity had
   committed to his care not only men's bodies but their souls as well.
   Thus arose the aggressive and all-devouring orthodoxy of State and
   Church, or, rather, of the State-Church. Examples which were to hand
   from the Old Testament completed and sanctified the process.

   Intolerance is a new growth in the land of the Greeks and cannot be
   roundly laid to their charge; but the way in which doctrine developed,
   namely, as a philosophy of God and the world, was due to their
   influence; and the fact that religion and doctrine were directly
   identified is also a product of the Greek spirit. No mere reference to
   the significance which doctrine already possessed in the apostolic age,
   and to the tendencies operating in the direction of bringing it into a
   speculative form, is sufficient to explain the change. These are
   matters, as I hope that I have shown in the previous lectures, which
   are rather to be understood in a different sense. It is in the second
   century, and with the apologists, that Intellectualism commences; and,
   supported by the struggle with the Gnostics and by the Alexandrian
   school of religious philosophers in the Church, it manages to prevail.

   But it is not enough to assess the teaching of the Greek Church by its
   formal side alone, and ascertain in what way and to what extent it is
   exhibited, and what is the value to be placed upon it. We must also
   examine its substance; for it possesses two elements which are quite
   peculiar to it and separate it from the Greek philosophy of
   religion--the idea of the creation, and the doctrine of the God-Man
   nature of the Saviour. We shall treat of these two elements in our next
   lecture, and, further, of the two other elements which, side by side
   with tradition and doctrine, characterise the Greek Church, namely, the
   form of worship and the order of monk-hood.
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE XIII

   SO far we have established the fact that Greek Catholicism is
   characterised as a religion by two elements: by traditionalism and by
   intellectualism. According to traditionalism, the reverent preservation
   of the received inheritance, and the defence of it against all
   innovation, is not only an important duty, but is itself the practical
   proof of religion. That is an idea quite in harmony with antiquity and
   foreign to the Gospel; for the Gospel knows absolutely nothing of
   intercourse with God being bound up with reverence for tradition
   itself. But the second element, intellectualism, is also of Greek
   origin. The elaboration of the Gospel into a vast philosophy of God and
   the world, in which every conceivable kind of material is handled; the
   conviction that because Christianity is the absolute religion it must
   give information on all questions of metaphysics, cosmology, and
   history; the view of revelation as a countless multitude of doctrines
   and explanations, all equally holy and important--this is Greek
   intellectualism. According to it, Knowledge is the highest good, and
   spirit is spirit only in so far as it knows; everything that is of an
   aesthetical, ethical, and religious character must be converted into
   some form of knowledge, which human will and life will then with
   certainty obey. The development of the Christian faith into an
   all-embracing theosophy, and the identification of faith with
   theological knowledge, are proofs that the Christian religion on Greek
   soil entered the proscribed circle of the native religious philosophy
   and has remained there.

   But in this vast philosophy of God and the world, which possesses an
   absolute value as the "substance of what has been revealed" and as
   "orthodox doctrine," there are two elements which radically distinguish
   it from Greek religious philosophy and invest it with an entirely
   original character. I do not mean the appeal which it makes to
   revelation--for to that the Neoplatonists also appealed but the idea of
   creation and the doctrine of the God-Man nature of the Saviour. They
   traverse the scheme of Greek religious philosophy at two critical
   points, and have therefore always been felt to be alien and intolerable
   by its genuine representatives.

   The idea of creation we can deal with in a few words. It is undoubtedly
   an element which is as important as it is in thorough keeping with the
   Gospel. It abolishes all intertwining of God and world, and gives
   expression to the power and actuality of the living God. Attempts were
   not wanting, it is true, among Christian thinkers on Greek soil just
   because they were Greeks to conceive the Deity only as the uniform
   power operating in the fabric of the world, as the unity in diversity,
   and as its goal. Traces of this speculative idea are even still to be
   found in the Church doctrine; the idea of creation, however, triumphed,
   and therewith Christianity won a real victory.

   The subject of the God-Man nature of the Saviour is one on which it is
   much more difficult to arrive at a correct opinion. It is indubitably
   the central point in the whole dogmatic system of the Greek Church. It
   supplied the doctrine of the Trinity. In the Greek view these two
   doctrines together make up Christian teaching in nuce. When a Father of
   the Greek Church once said, as he did say, "The idea of the God-Man
   nature, the idea of God becoming a man, is what is new in the new, nay,
   is the only new thing under the sun," not only did he correctly
   represent the opinion of all his fellow-believers, but he also at the
   same time strikingly expressed their view that, while sound
   intelligence and earnest reflection yield all the other points of
   doctrine of themselves, this one lies beyond them. The theologians of
   the Greek Church are convinced that the only real distinction between
   the Christian creed and natural philosophy is that the former embraces
   the doctrine of the God-Man nature, including the Trinity. Side by side
   with this, the only other doctrine that can at most come in question is
   that of the idea of creation.

   If that be so, it is of radical importance to obtain a correct view of
   the origin, meaning, and value of this doctrine. In its completed form
   it must look strange to anyone who comes to it straight from the
   evangelists. While no historical reflection can rid us of the
   impression that the whole fabric of ecclesiastical Christology is a
   thing absolutely outside the concrete personality of Jesus Christ,
   historical considerations nevertheless enable us not only to explain
   its origin but also even to justify, in a certain degree, the way in
   which it is formulated. Let us try to get a clear idea of the leading
   points.

   We saw in a previous lecture how it came about that the Church teachers
   selected the conception of the Logos in order to define Christ's nature
   and majesty. They found the conception of the "Messiah" quite
   unintelligible; it conveyed no meaning to them. As conceptions cannot
   be improvised, they had to choose between representing Christ as a
   deified man, that is to say, as a hero, or conceiving his nature after
   the pattern of one of the Greek gods, or identifying it with the Logos.
   The first two possibilities had to be put aside, as they were
   "heathenish," or seemed to be so. There remained, therefore, the Logos.
   How well this formula served different purposes we have already pointed
   out. Did it not readily admit of being combined with the conception of
   the Sonship, without leading to any objectionable theogonies? It
   involved, too, no menace to monotheism. But the formula had a logic of
   its own, and this logic led to results which were not absolutely free
   from suspicion. The conception of the Logos was susceptible of very
   varied expression; in spite of its sublime meaning, it could be also so
   conceived as to permit of the bearer of the title not being by any
   means of a truly divine nature but possessing one that was only half
   divine.

   The question as to the more exact definition of the nature of the
   Logos-Christ could not have attained the enormous significance which it
   received in the Church, and might have been stilled by various
   speculative answers, if it had not been accompanied by the triumph of a
   very precise idea of the nature of redemption, which acted as a
   peremptory challenge. Among all the possible ideas on the subject of
   redemption--forgiveness of sins, release from the power of the demons,
   and so on--that idea came victoriously to the front in the Church in
   the third century which conceived of it as redemption from death and
   therewith as elevation to the divine life, that is to say, as
   deification. It is true that this conception found a safe
   starting-point in the Gospel, and support in the Pauline theology; but
   in the form in which it was now developed it was foreign to both of
   them and conceived on Greek lines; mortality is in itself reckoned as
   the greatest evil, and as the cause of all evil, while the greatest of
   blessings is to live forever. What a severely Greek idea this is we can
   see, in the first place, from the fact that redemption from death is
   presented, in a wholly realistic fashion, as a pharmacological
   process,--the divine nature has to flow in and transform the mortal
   nature,--and, in the second, from the way in which eternal life and
   deification were identified. But if actual interference in the
   constitution of human nature and its deification are involved, then the
   Redeemer must himself be God and must become man. It is only on this
   condition that so marvellous a process can be imagined as actually
   taking place. Word, doctrine, individual deeds, are here of no
   avail--how can life be given to a stone, or a mortal made immortal, by
   preaching at them? Only when the divine itself bodily enters into
   mortality can mortality be transformed. It is not, however, the hero,
   but God Himself alone, who possesses the divine, that is to say,
   eternal life, and so possesses it as to permit of His giving it to
   others. The Logos, then, must be God Himself, and He must have actually
   become man. With the satisfying of these two conditions, real, natural
   redemption, that is to say, the deification of humanity, is actually
   effected. These considerations enable us to understand the prodigious
   disputes over the nature of the Logos-Christ which filled several
   centuries. They explain why Athanasius strove for the formula that the
   Logos-Christ was of the same nature as the Father, as though the
   existence or non-existence of the Christian religion were at stake.
   They show clearly how it was that other teachers in the Greek Church
   regarded any menace to the complete unity of the divine and the human
   in the Redeemer, any notion of a merely moral connexion, as a
   death-blow to Christianity. These teachers secured their formulas,
   which for them were anything but scholastic conceptions; rather, they
   were the statement and establishment of a matter of fact, in the
   absence of which the Christian religion was as unsatisfactory as any
   other. The doctrines of the identical nature of the three persons of
   the Trinity--how the doctrine of the Holy Ghost came about I need not
   mention--and of the God-Man nature of the Redeemer are in strict
   accordance with the distinguishing notion of the redemption as a
   deification of man's nature by making him immortal. Without the help of
   the notion those formulas would never have been attained; but they also
   stand and fall with it. They prevailed, however, not because they were
   akin to the ideas of Greek philosophy, but because they were contrasted
   with them. Greek philosophy never ventured, and never aspired, to meet,
   in any similar way by "history" and speculative ideas, that wish for
   immortality which it so vividly entertained. To attribute any such
   interference with the Cosmos to an historical personality and the
   manner in which it appeared, and to ascribe to that personality a
   transformation in what, given once for all, was in a state of eternal
   flux, must necessarily have seemed, to Greek philosophy, pure mythology
   and superstition. The "only new thing under the sun" must necessarily
   have appeared to it, and did appear, to be the worst kind of fable.

   The Greek Church still entertains the conviction to-day that in these
   doctrines it possesses the essence of Christianity, regarded at once as
   a mystery, and as a mystery that has been revealed. Criticism of this
   contention is not difficult. We must acknowledge that those doctrines
   powerfully contributed to keeping the Christian religion from
   dissolving into Greek religious philosophy; further, that they
   profoundly impress us with the absolute character of this religion;
   again, that they are in actual accordance with the Greek notion of
   redemption; lastly, that this very notion has one of its roots in the
   Gospel. But beyond this we can acknowledge nothing; nay, it is to be
   observed: (i.) that the notion of the redemption as a deification of
   mortal nature is subchristian, because the moral element involved can
   at best be only tacked on to it; (ii.) that the whole doctrine is
   inadmissible, because it has scarcely any connexion with the Jesus
   Christ of the Gospel, and its formulas do not fit him,--it is,
   therefore, not founded in truth; and (iii.) that as it is connected
   with the real Christ only by uncertain threads it leads us away from
   him,--it does not keep his image alive, but, on the contrary, demands
   that this image should be apprehended solely in the light of alleged
   hypotheses about him expressed in theoretical propositions. That this
   substitution produces no very serious or destructive effects is
   principally owing to the fact that in spite of them the Church has not
   suppressed the Gospels, and that their own innate power makes itself
   felt. It may also be conceded that the notion of God having become man
   does not everywhere produce the effect only of a bewildering mystery,
   but, on the contrary, is capable of leading to the pure and definite
   conviction that God was in Christ. We may admit, lastly, that the
   egoistic desire for immortal existence will, within the Christian
   sphere, experience a moral purification through the longing to live
   with and in God, and to remain inseparably bound to His love. But all
   these admissions cannot do away with the palpable fact that in Greek
   dogma we have a fatal connexion established between the desire of the
   ancients for immortal life and the Christian message. Nor can anyone
   deny that this connexion, implanted in Greek religious philosophy and
   the intellectualism which characterised it, has led to formulas which
   are incorrect, introduce a supposititious Christ in the place of the
   real one, and, besides, encourage the delusion that, if only a man
   possesses the right formula, he has the thing itself. Even though the
   Christological formula were the theologically right one--what a
   departure from the Gospel is involved in maintaining that a man can
   have no relation with Jesus Christ, nay, that he is sinning against him
   and will be cast out, unless he first of all acknowledges that Christ
   was one person with two natures and two powers of will, one of them
   divine and one human. Such is the demand into which intellectualism has
   developed. Can such a system still find a place for the Gospel story of
   the Syrophcenician woman or the centurion at Capernaum?

   But with traditionalism and intellectualism a further element is
   associated, namely, ritualism. If religion is presented as a complex
   system of traditional doctrine, to which the few alone have any real
   access, the majority of believers cannot practise it at all except as
   ritual. Doctrine comes to be administered in stereotyped formulas
   accompanied by symbolic acts. Although no inner understanding of it is
   thus possible, it produces the feeling of something mysterious. The
   very deification which the future is expected to bring, and which in
   itself is something that can neither be described nor conceived, is now
   administered, as though it were an earnest of what is to come, by means
   of ritual acts. An imaginative mood is excited, and disposes to its
   reception; and this excitement, when enhanced, is its seal.

   Such are the feelings which move the members of the Greek Catholic
   Church. Intercourse with God is achieved through the cult of a mystery,
   and by means of hundreds of efficacious formulas small and great,
   signs, pictures, and consecrated acts, which, if punctiliously and
   submissively observed, communicate divine grace and prepare the
   Christian for eternal life. Doctrine, as such, is for the most part
   something unknown; if it appears at all, it is only in the form of
   liturgical aphorisms. For ninety-nine per cent. of these Christians,
   religion exists only as a ceremonious ritual, in which it is
   externalised. But even for Christians of advanced intelligence all
   these ritual acts are absolutely necessary, for it is only in them that
   doctrine receives its correct application and obtains its due result.

   There is no sadder spectacle than this transformation of the Christian
   religion from a worship of God in spirit and in truth into a worship of
   God in signs, formulas, and idols. To feel the whole pity of this
   development, we need not descend to such adherents of this form of
   Christendom as are religiously and intellectually in a state of
   complete abandonment, like the Copts and Abyssinians; the Syrians,
   Greeks, and Russians are, taken as a whole, only a little better.
   Where, however, can we find in Jesus' message even a trace of any
   injunction that a man is to submit to solemn ceremonies as though they
   were mysterious ministrations, to be punctilious in observing a ritual,
   to put up pictures, and to mumble maxims and formulas in a prescribed
   fashion? It was to destroy this sort of religion that Jesus Christ
   suffered himself to be nailed to the cross, and now we find it
   re-established under his name and authority! Not only has "mystagogy"
   stepped into a position side by side with the "mathesis," that is to
   say, the doctrine, which called it forth; but the truth is that
   "doctrine"--be its constitution what it may, it is still a spiritual
   principle--has disappeared, and ceremony dominates everything. This is
   what marks the relapse into the ancient form of the lowest class of
   religion. Over the vast area of Greek and Oriental Christendom religion
   has been almost stifled by ritualism. It is not that religion has
   sacrificed one of its essential elements. No! it has entered an
   entirely different plane; it has descended to the level where religion
   may be described as a cult and nothing but a cult.

   Nevertheless, Greek and Oriental Christianity contains within itself an
   element which for centuries has been capable of offering, and still
   offers here and there to-day, a certain resistance to the combined
   forces of traditionalism, intellectualism, and ritualism--I mean
   monasticism. To the question, Who is in the highest sense of the word
   Christian? the Greek Christian replies: the monk. The man who practises
   silence and purity, who shuns not only the world but also the Church of
   the world; who avoids not only false doctrine but any statement about
   the true; who fasts, gives himself up to contemplation, and steadily
   waits for God's glorious light to dawn upon his gaze; who attaches no
   value to anything but tranquillity and meditation on the Eternal; who
   asks nothing of life but death, and who from such utter unselfishness
   and purity makes mercy arise this is the Christian. To him not even the
   Church and the consecration which it bestows is an absolute necessity.
   For such a man the whole system of sanctified secularity has vanished.
   Over and over again in ascetics of this kind the Church has seen in its
   ranks figures of such strength and delicacy of religious feeling, so
   filled with the divine, so inwardly active in forming themselves after
   certain features of Christ's image, that we may, indeed, say, Here
   there is a living religion not unworthy of Christ's name. We
   Protestants must not take direct offence at the form of monasticism.
   The conditions under which our churches arose have made a harsh and
   one-sided opinion of it a kind of duty. And although for the present,
   and in view of the problems which press on us, we may be justified in
   retaining this opinion, we must not summarily apply it to other
   circumstances. Nothing but monasticism could provide a leaven and a
   counterpoise in that traditionalistic and ritualistic secular Church
   such as the Greek Church was and still is. Here there was freedom,
   independence, and vivid experience; here the truth that it is only what
   is experienced and comes from within that has any value in religion
   carried the day.

   And yet, the invaluable tension which in this part of Christendom
   existed between the secular Church and monasticism has unhappily almost
   disappeared, and of the blessing which it established there is scarcely
   a trace left. Not only has monasticism become subject to the Church and
   is everywhere bent under its yoke, but the secular spirit has in a
   special degree invaded the monasteries. Greek and Oriental monks are
   now, as a rule, the instruments of the lowest and worst functions of
   the Church, of the worship of pictures and relics, of the crassest
   superstition and the most imbecile sorcery. Exceptions are not wanting,
   and it is still to the monks that we must pin our hopes of a better
   future; but it is not easy to see how a Church is to be reformed which,
   teach what it will, is content with its adherents finding the Christian
   faith in the observance of certain ceremonies, and Christian morality
   in keeping fast-days correctly.

   As to our last question: What modifications did the Gospel undergo in
   this Church and how did it hold its own? Well, in the first place, I do
   not expect to be contradicted if I answer that this official
   ecclesiasticism with its priests and its cult, with all its vessels,
   saints, vestments, pictures, and amulets, with its ordinances of
   fasting and its festivals, has absolutely nothing to do with the
   religion of Christ. It is the religion of the ancient world tacked on
   to certain conceptions in the Gospel; or, rather, it is the ancient
   religion with the Gospel absorbed into it. The religious moods which
   are here produced or which turn towards this kind of religion are, in
   so far as they can still be called religious at all, of a class lower
   than Christian. But neither have its traditionalism and its "orthodoxy"
   much in common with the Gospel; they, too, were not derived from it and
   cannot be traced back to it. Correct doctrine, reverence, obedience,
   the shudderings of awe, may be valuable and edifying things; they may
   avail to bind and restrain the individual, especially when they draw
   him into the community of a stable society; but they have nothing to do
   with the Gospel, as long as they fail to touch the individual at the
   point where freedom lies, and inner decision for or against God. In
   contrast with this, monasticism, in its resolve to serve God by an
   ascetic and contemplative life, contains an incomparably more valuable
   element, because sayings of Christ, even though applied in a one-sided
   and limited way, are nevertheless taken as a standard, and the
   possibility of an independent inner life being kindled is not so far
   removed.

   Not so far removed--entirely lacking, thank God, it is not, even in the
   waste shrines of this ecclesiasticism, and Christ's sayings sound in
   the ear of any who visit its churches. On the Church as a Church,
   apparatus and all, there is nothing more favourable to be said than has
   been said already; the best thing about it is that it keeps up,
   although to a modest extent, the knowledge of the Gospel. Jesus' words,
   even though only mumbled by the priests, take the first place in this
   Church, too, and the quiet mission which they pursue is not suppressed.
   Side by side with the magical apparatus and the transports of feeling,
   of which the ceremony is only the caput mortuum, stand Jesus' sayings;
   they are read in private and in public, and no superstition avails to
   destroy their power. Nor can its fruits be mistaken by anyone who will
   look below the surface. Among these Christians, too, priests and laity,
   there are men who have come to know God as the Father of mercy and the
   leader of their lives, and who love Jesus Christ, not because they know
   him as the person with two natures, but because a ray of his being has
   shone from the Gospel into their hearts, and this ray has become light
   and warmth to their own lives. And although the idea of the fatherly
   providence of God more readily assumes an almost fatalistic form in the
   East, and produces too much quietism, it is certain that here, too, it
   endows men with strength and energy, unselfishness and love. I need
   only refer again to Tolstoi's Village Tales, which I have already
   quoted. The picture which they present is not artificial. But from much
   also that I have myself seen and experienced I can testify how even
   with the Russian peasant or the humbler priests, in spite of all the
   saint- and picture-worship, a power of simple trust in God is to be
   found, a delicacy of moral feeling, and an active brotherly love, which
   does not disclaim its origin in the Gospel. Where they exist, however,
   the entire ceremonial service of religion is capable of undergoing a
   spiritualisation, not by any "symbolical re-interpretation,"--that is
   much too artificial a process,--but because, if only the soul is
   touched by the living God at all, thought can rise to him even by the
   help of an idol.

   But it is truly no accidental circumstance that, in so far as any
   independent religious life is to be found among the members of this
   Church, it at once takes shape in trust in God, in humility, in
   unselfishness and mercy, and that Jesus Christ is at the same time laid
   hold of with reverence; for these are just the indications which show
   us that the Gospel is not as yet stifled, and that it is in these
   religious virtues that it has its real substance.

   As a whole and in its structure the system of the Oriental Churches is
   foreign to the Gospel; it means at once a veritable transformation of
   the Christian faith and the depression of religion to a much lower
   level, namely, that of the ancient world. But in its monasticism, in so
   far as this is not entirely subject to the secular Church and itself
   secularised, there is an element which reduces the whole ecclesiastical
   apparatus to a secondary position, and which opens up the possibility
   of attaining a state of Christian independence. Above all, however, by
   not having suppressed the Gospel, but by having kept it accessible,
   even though in a meagre fashion, the Church still possesses the
   corrective in its midst. Side by side with the Church the Gospel
   exercises its own influence on individuals. This influence, however,
   takes shape in a type of religion exhibiting the very characteristics
   which we have shown to be most distinctive of Jesus' message. Thus on
   the ground occupied by this Church the Gospel has not completely
   perished. Here, too, human souls find a dependence on God and a freedom
   in Him, and when they have found these, they speak the language which
   every Christian understands, and which goes to every Christian's heart.

LECTURE XIV

  THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN ROMAN CATHOLICISM

   THE Roman Church is the most comprehensive and the vastest, the most
   complicated and yet at the same time the most uniform structure which,
   as far as we know, history has produced. All the powers of the human
   mind and soul, and all the elemental forces at mankind's disposal, have
   had a hand in creating it. In its many-sided character and severe
   cohesion Roman Catholicism is far in advance of Greek. We ask, in turn:

   What did the Roman Catholic Church achieve?

   What are its characteristics?

   What modifications has the Gospel suffered in this Church, and how much
   of it has remained?

   What did the Roman Catholic Church achieve? Well, in the first place,
   it educated the Romano-Germanic nations, and educated them in a sense
   other than that in which the Eastern Church educated the Greeks, Slays,
   and Orientals. However much their original nature, or primitive and
   historical circumstances, may have favoured those nations and helped to
   promote their rise, the value of the services which the Church rendered
   is not thereby diminished. It brought Christian civilisation to young
   nations, and brought it, not once only,--so as to keep them at its
   first stage,--no! it gave them something which was capable of
   exercising a progressive educational influence, and for a period of
   almost a thousand years it itself led the advance. Up to the fourteenth
   century it was a leader and a mother; it supplied the ideas, set the
   aims, and disengaged the forces. Up to the fourteenth
   century--thenceforward, as we may see, those whom it educated became
   independent, and struck out paths which it did not indicate, and on
   which it is neither willing nor able to follow them. But even so,
   however, during the period covered by the last six hundred years it has
   not fallen so far behind as the Greek Church. With comparatively brief
   interruptions it has proved itself fully a match for the whole movement
   of politics,--we in Germany know that well enough!--and even in the
   movement of thought it still has an important share. The time, of
   course, is long past since it was a leader; on the contrary, it is now
   a drag; but, in view of the mistaken and precipitate elements in modern
   progress, the drag which it supplies is not always the reverse of a
   blessing.

   In the second place, however, this Church upheld the idea of religious
   and ecclesiastical independence in Western Europe in the face of the
   tendencies, not lacking here either, towards State-omnipotence in the
   spiritual domain. In the Greek Church, as we saw, religion has become
   so intimately allied with nationality and the State that, public
   worship and monasticism apart, it has no room left for independent
   action. On Western ground it is otherwise; the religious element and
   the moral element bound up with it occupy an independent sphere and
   jealously guard it. This we owe in the main to the Roman Church.

   These two facts embrace the most important piece of work which this
   Church achieved and in part still achieves. We have already indicated
   the bounds which must be set to the first. To the second also a
   sensible limitation attaches, and we shall see what it is as we
   proceed.

   What are the characteristics of the Roman Church? This was our second
   question. Unless I am mistaken, the Church, complicated as it is, may
   be resolved into three chief elements. The first, Catholicism, it
   shares with the Greek Church. The second is the Latin spirit and the
   Roman World-Empire continuing in the Roman Church. The third is the
   spirit and religious fervour of St. Augustine. So far as the inner life
   of this Church is religious life and religious thought, it follows the
   standard which St. Augustine authoritatively fixed. Not only has he
   arisen again and again in his many successors, but he has awakened and
   kindled numbers of men who, coming forward with independent religious
   and theological fervour, are nevertheless spirit of his spirit.

   These three elements, the Catholic, the Latin in the sense of the Roman
   World-Empire, and the Augustinian, constitute the peculiar character of
   the Roman Church.

   So far as the first is concerned, you may recognise its importance by
   the fact that the Roman Church to-day receives every Greek Christian,
   nay, at once effects a "union" with every Greek ecclesiastical
   community, without more ado, as soon as the Pope is acknowledged and
   submission is made to his apostolic supremacy. Any other condition that
   may be exacted from the Greek Christians is of absolutely no moment;
   they are even allowed to retain divine worship in their mother tongue,
   and married priests. If we consider what a "purification" Protestants
   have to undergo before they can be received into the bosom of the Roman
   Church, the difference is obvious. Now a Church cannot make so great a
   mistake about itself as to omit any essential condition in taking up
   new members, especially if they come from another confession. The
   element which the Roman Church shares with the Greek must, then, be of
   significant and critical importance, when it is sufficient to make
   union possible on the condition that the papal supremacy is recognised.
   As a matter of fact, the main points characteristic of Greek
   Catholicism are all to be found in Roman as well, and are, on occasion,
   just as energetically maintained here as they are there.
   Traditionalism, orthodoxy, and ritualism play just the same part here
   as they do there, so far as "higher considerations" do not step in; and
   the same is true of monasticism also.

   So far as "higher considerations" do not step in --here we have already
   passed to the examination of the second element, namely, the Latin
   spirit in the sense of the Roman World-dominion. In the Western half of
   Christendom the Latin spirit, the spirit of Rome, very soon effected
   certain distinct modifications in the general Catholic idea. As early
   as the beginning of the third century we see the thought emerging in
   the Latin Fathers that salvation, however effected and whatever its
   nature, is bestowed in the form of a contract under definite
   conditions, and only to the extent to which they are observed; it is
   salus legitima; in fixing these conditions the Deity manifested its
   mercy and indulgence, but it guards their observance all the more
   jealously. Further, the whole contents of revelation are lex, the Bible
   as well as tradition. Again, this tradition is attached to a class of
   officials and to their correct succession. The "mysteries," however,
   are "sacraments"; that is to say, on the one hand, they are binding
   acts; on the other, they contain definite gifts of grace in a carefully
   limited form and with a specific application. Again, the discipline of
   penance is a procedure laid down by law and akin to the process adopted
   in a civil action or a suit in defence of honour. Lastly, the Church is
   a legal institution; and it is so, not side by side with its function
   of preserving and distributing salvation, but it is a legal institution
   for the sake of this very function.

   But it is in its constitution as a Church that it is a legal
   establishment. We must briefly see how things stand in regard to this
   constitution, as its foundations are common to the Eastern and the
   Western Church. When the monarchical episcopate had developed, the
   Church began to approximate its constitution to State government. The
   system of uniting sees under a metropolitan who was, as a rule, the
   bishop of the provincial capital, corresponded with the distribution of
   the Empire into provinces. Above and beyond this, the ecclesiastical
   constitution in the East was developed a step further when it adapted
   itself to the division of the Empire introduced by Diocletian, by which
   large groups of provinces were united. Thus arose the constitution of
   the patriarchate, which was not, however, strictly enforced, and was in
   part counteracted by other considerations.

   In the West no division into patriarchates came about; but, on the
   other hand, something else happened: in the fifth century the Western
   Roman Empire perished of internal weakness and through the inroads of
   the barbarians. What was left of what was Roman took refuge in the
   Roman Church--civilisation, law, and orthodox faith as opposed to the
   Arian. The barbarian chiefs, however, did not venture to set themselves
   up as Roman Emperors, and enter the vacant shrine of the imperium; they
   founded empires of their own in the provinces. In these circumstances
   the Bishop of Rome appeared as the guardian of the past and the shield
   of the future. All over the provinces occupied by the barbarians, even
   in those which had previously maintained a defiant independence in the
   face of Rome, bishops and laity looked to him. Whatever Roman elements
   the barbarians and Arians left standing in the provinces--and they were
   not few--were ecclesiasticised and at the same time put under the
   protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after
   the Emperor's disappearance. But in Rome the episcopal throne was
   occupied in the fifth century by men who understood the signs of the
   times and utilised them to the full. The Roman Church in this way
   privily pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of
   which it is the actual continuation; the empire has not perished, but
   has only undergone a transformation. If we assert, and mean the
   assertion to hold good even of the present time, that the Roman Church
   is the old Roman Empire consecrated by the Gospel, that is no mere
   "clever remark," but the recognition of the true state of the matter
   historically, and the most appropriate and fruitful way of describing
   the character of this Church. It still governs the nations; its Popes
   rule like Trajan and Marcus Aurelius; Peter and .Paul have taken the
   place of Romulus and Remus; the bishops and archbishops, of the
   proconsuls; the troops of priests and monks correspond to the legions;
   the Jesuits, to the imperial body-guard. The continued influence of the
   old Empire and its institutions may be traced in detail, down to
   individual legal ordinances, nay, even in the very clothes. That is no
   Church like the evangelical communities, or the national Churches of
   the East; it is a political creation, and as imposing as a
   World-Empire, because the continuation of the Roman Empire. The Pope,
   who calls himself "King" and "Pontifex Maximus," is Caesar's successor.
   The Church, which as early as the third and fourth century was entirely
   filled with the Roman spirit, has re-established in itself the Roman
   Empire. Nor have patriotic Catholics in Rome and Italy in every century
   from the seventh and eighth onwards understood the matter otherwise.
   When Gregory VII. entered upon the struggle with the imperial power,
   this is the way in which an Italian prelate fired his ardour:


     Seize the first Apostle's sword,

     Peter's glowing sword, and smite!

     Scatter far the savage horde;

     Break their wild, impetuous might!

     Let them feel the yoke of yore,

     Let them bear it evermore!


     &gt;What with blood in Marius' day,

     Marius and his soldiers brave,

     Or, by Julius' mighty sway,

     Romans did their land to save,

     Thou canst do by simple word.

     Great the Church's holy sword!


     Rome made great again by thee

     Offers all thy weed of praise;

     Not for Scipio's victory

     Did it louder paeans raise,

     Nor entwine the laurel crown

     For a deed of more renown.

   Who is it that is thus addressed, a bishop or a Caesar? A Caesar, I
   imagine; it was felt to be so then, and it is still felt to be so
   to-day. It is an Empire that this priestly Caesar rules, and to attack
   it with the armament of dogmatic polemics alone is to beat the air.

   I cannot here show what immense results followfrom the fact that the
   Catholic Church is the Roman Empire. Let me mention only a few
   conclusions which the Church itself draws. It is just as essential to
   this Church to exercise governmental power as to proclaim the Gospel.
   The phrase "Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus triumphat," must
   be understood in a political sense. He rules on earth by the fact that
   his Rome-directed Church rules, and rules, too, by law and by force;
   that is to say, it employs all the means of which states avail
   themselves. Accordingly it recognises no form of religious fervour
   which does not first of all submit to this papal Church, is approved by
   it, and remains in constant dependence upon it. This Church, then,
   teaches its "subjects" to say: "Though I understand all mysteries, and
   though I have all faith, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the
   poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not unity in
   love, which alone floweth from unconditional obedience to the Church,
   it profiteth me nothing." Outside the pale of the Church, all faith,
   all love, all the virtues, even martyrdoms, are of no value whatever.
   Naturally; for even an earthly state appreciates only those services
   which a man has rendered for its sake. But here the state identifies
   itself with the kingdom of Heaven, in other respects proceeding just
   like other states. From this fact you can yourselves deduce all the
   Church's claims; they follow without difficulty. Even the most
   exorbitant demand appears quite natural as soon as you only admit the
   truth of the two leading propositions: "The Roman Church is the kingdom
   of God," and, "The Church must govern like an earthly state." It is not
   to be denied that Christian motives have also had a hand in this
   development: the desire to bring the Christian religion into a real
   connexion with life, and to make its influence felt in every situation
   that may arise, as well as anxiety for the salvation of individuals and
   of nations. How many earnest Catholic Christians there have been who
   had no other real desire than to establish Christ's rule on earth and
   build up his kingdom! But while there can be no doubt that their
   intention, and the energy with which they put their hands to the work,
   made them superior to the Greeks, there can be as little that it is a
   serious misunderstanding of Christ's and the apostles' injunctions to
   aim at establishing and building up the kingdom of God by political
   means. The only forces which this kingdom knows are religious and moral
   forces, and it rests on a basis of freedom. But when a church comes
   forward with the claims of an earthly state, it is bound to make use of
   all the means at the disposal of that state, including, therefore,
   crafty diplomacy and force; for the earthly state, even a state
   governed by law, must on occasion become a state that acts contrary to
   law. The course of development which this Church has followed as an
   earthly state was, then, bound to lead logically to the absolute
   monarchy of the Pope and his infallibility; for in an earthly theocracy
   infallibility means, at bottom, nothing more than full sovereignty
   means in a secular state. That the Church has not shrunk from drawing
   this last conclusion is a proof of the extent to which the sacred
   element in it has become secularised. ,

   That this second element was bound to produce a radical change in the
   characteristic features of Catholicism in Western Europe, in its
   traditionalism, its orthodoxy, its ritualism, and its monasticism, is
   obvious. Traditionalism holds the same position after the change as it
   did before; but when any element in it has become inconvenient, it is
   dropped and its place taken by the papal will. "La tradition, c'est
   moi" as Pius IX. is reported to have said. Further, "sound doctrine" is
   still a leading principle, but, as a matter of fact, it can be altered
   by the ecclesiastical policy of the Pope; subtle distinctions have
   given many a dogma a new meaning. New dogmas, too, are promulgated. In
   many respects doctrine has become more arbitrary, and a rigid formula
   in a matter of dogma may be set aside by a contrary injunction in a
   matter of ethics and in the confessional. The hard and fast lines of
   the past can be everywhere relaxed in favour of the needs of the
   present. The same holds good of ritualism, as also of monasticism. The
   extent to which the old monasticism has been altered, by no means
   always to its disadvantage alone, and has even in some important
   aspects been transformed into its flat opposite, I cannot here show. In
   its organisation this Church possesses a faculty of adapting itself to
   the course of history such as no other Church possesses; it always
   remains the same old Church, or seems to do so, and is always becoming
   a new one.

   The third element determining the character of the spirit prevalent in
   the Church is opposed to that which we have just discussed, and yet has
   held its own side by side with the second: it goes by the names of
   Augustine and Augustinianism. In the fifth century, at the very time
   when the Church was setting itself to acquire the inheritance of the
   Roman Empire, it came into possession of a religious genius of
   extraordinary depth and power, accepted his ideas and feelings, and up
   to the present day has been unable to get rid of them. That the Church
   became at one and the same time Caesarian and Augustinian is the most
   important and marvellous fact in its history. What kind of a spirit,
   however, and what kind of a tendency, did it receive from Augustine?

   Well, in the first place, Augustine's theology and his religious
   fervour denote a special resuscitation of the Pauline experience and
   doctrine of sin and grace, of guilt and justification, of divine
   predestination and human servitude. In the centuries that had elapsed
   since the apostle's day this experience and the doctrine embodying it
   had been lost, but Augustine went through the same inner experiences as
   Paul, gave them the same sort of expression, and clothed them in
   definite conceptions. There was no question here of mere imitation; the
   individual differences between the two cases are of the utmost
   importance, especially in the way in which the doctrine of
   justification is conceived. With Augustine, it was represented as a
   constant process, continuing until love and all the virtues completely
   filled the heart; but, as with Paul, it is all a matter of individual
   experience and inner life. If you read Augustine's Confessions you will
   acknowledge that in spite of all the rhetoric--and rhetoric there
   is--it is the work of a genius who has felt God, the God of the Spirit,
   to be the be-all and the end-all of his life; who thirsts after Him and
   desires nothing beside Him. Further, all the sad and terrible
   experiences which he had had in his own person, all the rupture with
   himself, all the service of transient things, the "crumbling away into
   the world bit by bit," and the egoism for which he had to pay in loss
   of strength and freedom, he reduces to the one root, sin; that is to
   say, lack of communion with God, godlessness. Again, what released him
   from the entanglements of the world, from selfishness and inner decay,
   and gave him strength, freedom, and a consciousness of the Eternal, he
   calls, with Paul, grace. With him he feels, too, that grace is wholly
   the work of God, but that it is obtained through and by Christ, and
   possessed as forgiveness of sins and as the spirit of love. He is much
   less free and more beset with scruples in his view of sin than the
   great apostle; and it is this which gives his religious language and
   everything that proceeded from him quite a peculiar colour. "Forgetting
   those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
   which are before"--the apostolic maxim is not Augustine's. Consolation
   for the misery of sin--this is the complexion of his entire
   Christianity. Only rarely was he capable of soaring to the sense of the
   glorious liberty of the children of God; and, where he was so capable,
   he could not testify to it in the same way as Paul. But he could
   express the sense of consolation for the misery of sin with a strength
   of feeling and in words of an overwhelming force such as no one before
   him ever displayed; nay, more: he has managed by what he has written to
   go so straight to the souls of millions, to describe so precisely their
   inner condition, and so impressively and overpoweringly to put the
   consolation before them, that what he felt has been felt again and
   again for fifteen hundred years. Up to the day in which we live, so far
   as Catholic Christians are concerned, inward and vivid religious
   fervour, and the expression which it takes, are in their whole
   character Augustinian. It is by what he felt that they are kindled, and
   it is his thoughts that they think. Nor is it otherwise with many
   Protestants, and those not of the worst kind. This juxtaposition of sin
   and grace, this interconnexion of feeling and doctrine, seems to
   possess an indestructible power which no lapse of time is able to
   touch; this feeling of mixed pain and bliss is an unforgettable
   possession with those who have once experienced it; and even though
   they may have subsequently emancipated themselves from religion it
   remains for them a sacred memory.

   The Western Church opened, and was compelled to open, its doors to this
   Augustine at the very moment when it was preparing to enter upon its
   dominion. It was defenceless in face of him; it had so little of any
   real value to offer from its immediate past that it weakly capitulated.
   Thus arose the astonishing "complexio oppositorum" which we see in
   Western Catholicism: the Church of rites, of law, of politics, of
   world-dominion, and the Church in which a highly individual, delicate,
   sublimated sense and doctrine of sin and grace is brought into play.
   The external and the internal elements are supposed to unite! To speak
   frankly, this has been impossible from the beginning; internal tension
   and conflict were bound to arise at once; the history of Western
   Catholicism is full of it. Up to a certain point, however, these
   antitheses admit of being reconciled; they admit of it at least so far
   as the same men are concerned. That is proved by no less a person than
   Augustine himself, who, in addition to his other characteristics, was
   also a staunch Churchman; nay, who in such matters as power and
   prestige promoted the external interests of the Church, and its
   equipment as a whole, with the greatest energy. I cannot here explain
   how he managed to accomplish this work, but that there could be no lack
   of internal contradictions in it is n obvious. Only let us be clear
   about two facts: firstly, that the outward Church is more and more
   forcing the inward Augustinianism into the background, and transforming
   and modifying it, without, however, being able wholly to destroy it;
   secondly, that all the great personalities who have continued to kindle
   religious fervour afresh in the Western Church, and to purify and
   deepen it, have directly or indirectly proceeded from Augustine and
   formed themselves on him. The long chain of Catholic reformers, from
   Agobard and Claudius of Turin in the ninth century down to the
   Jansenists in the seventeenth and eighteenth, and beyond them, is
   Augustinian. And if the Council of Trent may be in many respects
   rightly called a Council of Reform; if the doctrine of penance and
   grace was formulated then with much more depth and inwardness than
   could be expected from the state of Catholic theology in the fourteenth
   and fifteenth centuries, that is only owing to the continued influence
   of Augustine. With the doctrine of grace, taken from Augustine, the
   Church has, indeed, associated a practice of the confessional which
   threatens to make that doctrine absolutely ineffective. But, however
   far it may stretch its bounds so as to keep all those within its pale
   who do not revolt against its authority, it after all not only
   tolerates such as take the same view of sin and grace as Augustine, but
   it also desires that, wherever possible, everyone may feel as strongly
   as he the gravity of sin and the blessedness of belonging to God.

   Such are the essential elements of Roman Catholicism. There is much
   else that might be mentioned, but what has been said denotes the
   leading points.

   We pass to the last question: What modifications has the Gospel here
   undergone, and how much of it is left? Well,--this is not a matter that
   needs many words, the whole outward and visible institution of a Church
   claiming divine dignity has no foundation whatever in the Gospel. It is
   a case, not of distortion, but of total perversion. Religion has here
   strayed away in a direction that is not its own. As Eastern Catholicism
   may in many respects be more appropriately regarded as part of the
   history of Greek religion than of the history of the Gospel, so Roman
   Catholicism must be regarded as part of the history of the Roman
   World-Empire. To contend, as it does, that Christ founded a kingdom;
   that this kingdom is the Roman Church; that he equipped it with a
   sword, nay, with two swords, a spiritual and a temporal, is to
   secularise the Gospel; nor can this contention be sustained by
   appealing to the idea that Christ's spirit ought certainly to bear rule
   amongst mankind. The Gospel says, "Christ's kingdom is not of this
   world," but the Church has set up an earthly kingdom; Christ demands
   that his ministers shall not rule but serve, but here the priests
   govern the world; Christ leads his disciples away from political and
   ceremonious religion and places every man face to face with God--God
   and the soul, the soul and its God, but here, on the contrary, man is
   bound to an earthly institution with chains that cannot be broken, and
   he must obey; it is only when he obeys that he approaches God. There
   was a time when Roman Christians shed their blood because they refused
   to do worship to Caesar, and rejected religion of the political kind;
   to-day they do not, indeed, actually pray to an earthly ruler, but they
   have subjected their souls to the despotic orders of the Roman papal
   king.

LECTURE XV

   THE point to which we referred at the close of the last lecture was
   that, as an outward and visible church and a state founded on law and
   on force, Roman Catholicism has nothing to do with the Gospel, nay, is
   in fundamental contradiction with it. That this state has borrowed a
   divine lustre from the Gospel, and finds this lustre extraordinarily
   advantageous, cannot avail to upset the verdict. To mix the divine with
   the secular, and what is innermost in a man with a political element,
   is to work the greatest of mischiefs, because the conscience is thereby
   enslaved and religion robbed of its solemn character. It is inevitable
   that this character should be lost when every possible measure which
   serves to maintain the earthly empire of the Church--for example, the
   sovereignty of the Pope--is proclaimed as the divine will. We are
   reminded, however, that it is just this independent action on the part
   of the Church which saves religion in Western Europe from entirely
   degenerating into nationality, or the state, or police. The Church, it
   is urged, has maintained intact the high idea of the complete
   self-subsistence of religion and its independence of the state. We may
   admit the claim, but the price which Western Europe has had to pay for
   this service, and still pays, is much too great; by having to pay so
   heavy a tribute, the nations are threatened with bankruptcy within;
   and, as for the Church, the capital which it has amassed is truly a
   capital that consumes. With all the apparent increase in its power, a
   pauperising process is slowly being accomplished in the Church; slowly
   but surely. Let me here digress from our subject for a moment.

   No one who looks at the present political situation can have any ground
   for asserting that the power of the Roman Church is on the wane. What a
   growth it has experienced in the nineteenth century! And yet--any one
   with a keen eye sees that the Church is far from possessing now such a
   plenitude of power .as it enjoyed in the twelfth and thirteenth
   centuries, when all the material and spiritual forces available were at
   its disposal. Since that epoch its power has, in point of intensity,
   suffered an enormous decline, arrested by a few brief outbursts of
   enthusiasm between 1540 and 1620, and in the nineteenth century.
   Earnest Catholics, concerned at this fact, make no secret of it; they
   know and admit that an important portion of the spiritual possessions
   necessary to the dominion of the Church has been lost to it. And again:
   what is the position of the Latin nations which, when all is said, form
   the proper province of the Roman Church's rule? There is only one of
   them which can really be called a great Power, and what sort of
   spectacle will it present in another generation? As a state this Church
   lives to-day, to a not inconsiderable extent, on its history, its old
   Roman and mediaeval history;--and it lives as the Roman Empire of the
   Romans. But empires do not live for ever. Will the Church be capable of
   maintaining itself in the great changes to come? Will it bear the
   increasing tension between it and the intellectual life of the people?
   Will it survive the decline of the Latin nations?

   But let us leave this question to answer itself. Let us recollect,
   rather, that this Church, thanks above all to its Augustinianism,
   possesses in its orders of monkhood and its religious societies a deep
   element of life in its midst. In all ages it has produced saints, so
   far as men can be so called, and it still produces them to-day. Trust
   in God, unaffected humility, the assurance of redemption, the devotion
   of one's life to the service of one's brethren, are to be found in it;
   many brethren take up the cross of Christ and exercise at one and the
   same time that self-judgment and that joy in God which Paul and
   Augustine achieved. The Imitatio Christi kindles independent religious
   life, and a fire which burns with a flame of its own. Ecclesiasticism
   has not availed to suppress the power of the Gospel, which, in spite of
   the frightful weight that it has to carry, makes its way again and
   again. It still works like leaven, nor can we fail to see that this
   Church, side by side with a lax morality for which it has often enough
   been to blame, has, by the mouth of its great mediaeval theologians,
   fruitfully applied the Gospel to many circumstances of life and created
   a Christian ethics. Here and elsewhere it has proved that it not only
   carries, as it were, the thought of the Gospel with it as a river
   carries grains of gold, but that they are bound up with it and have
   been further developed in it. The infallible Pope, the
   "Apostolico-Roman polytheism," the veneration of the saints, blind
   obedience, and apathetic devotion--these things seem to have stifled
   all inwardness, and yet there are Christians still to be found in this
   Church, too, of the kind which the Gospel has awakened, earnest and
   loving, filled with joy and peace in God. Lastly, the mischief is not
   that the Gospel has been bound up with political forms at
   all,--Melanchthon was no traitor when he expressed his willingness to
   acknowledge the Pope if he would permit the Gospel to be preached in
   its purity,--but it lies in the sanctification of the political
   element, and in the inability of this Church to get rid of what was
   once of service in particular historical circumstances, but has now
   become an obstruction and a clog.

   We now pass to the last section in the exposition of our subject.

  THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN PROTESTANTISM

   Anyone who looks at the external condition of Protestantism, especially
   in Germany, may, at first sight, well exclaim: "What a miserable
   spectacle!" But no one can survey the history of Europe from the second
   century to the present time without being forced to the conclusion that
   in the whole course of this history the greatest movement and the one
   most pregnant with good was the Reformation in the sixteenth century;
   even the great change which took place at the transition to the
   nineteenth is inferior to it in importance. What do all our discoveries
   and inventions and our advances in outward civilisation signify in
   comparison with the fact that to-day there are thirty millions of
   Germans, and many more millions of Christians outside Germany, who
   possess a religion without priests, without sacrifices, without
   "fragments" of grace, without ceremonies--a spiritual religion!

   Protestantism must be understood, first and foremost, by the contrast
   which it offers to Catholicism, and here there is a double direction
   which any estimate of it must take, first as Reformation and secondly
   as Revolution. It was a reformation in regard to the doctrine of
   salvation; a revolution in regard to the Church, its authority, and its
   apparatus. Hence Protestantism is no spontaneous phenomenon, created as
   it were by a "generatio equivoca"; but, as its very name implies, it
   was called into being by the misdeeds of the Roman Church having become
   intolerable. It was the close of a long series of cognate but
   ineffectual attempts at reform in the Middle Ages. If the position
   which it thus holds in history proves its continuity with the past, the
   fact is still more strongly in evidence in its own and not
   inappropriate contention that it was not an innovation in regard to
   religion, but a restoration and renewal of it. But from the point of
   view of the Church and its authority Protestantism was undoubtedly a
   revolutionary phenomenon. We must, then, take account of it in both
   these relations.

   Protestantism was a Reformation, that is to say, a renewal, as regards
   the core of the matter, as regards religion, and consequently as
   regards the doctrine of salvation. That may be shown in the main in
   three points.

   In the first place, religion was here brought back again to itself, in
   so far as the Gospel and the corresponding religious experience were
   put into the foreground and freed of all alien accretions. Religion was
   taken out of the vast and monstrous fabric which had been previously
   called by its name--a fabric embracing the Gospel and holy water, the
   priesthood of all believers and the Pope on his throne, Christ the
   Redeemer and St. Anne--and was reduced to its essential factors, to the
   Word of God and to faith. This truth was imposed as a criterion on
   everything that also claimed to be "religion" and to unite on terms of
   equality with those great factors. In the history of religions every
   really important reformation is always, first and foremost, a critical
   reduction to principles; for, in the course of its historical
   development, religion, by adapting itself to circumstances, attracts to
   itself much alien matter, and produces, in conjunction with this, a
   number of hybrid and apocryphal elements, which it is necessarily
   compelled to place under the protection of what is sacred. If it is not
   to run wild from exuberance, or be choked by its own dry leaves, the
   reformer must come who purifies it and brings it back to itself. This
   critical reduction to principles Luther accomplished in the sixteenth
   century, by victoriously declaring that the Christian religion was
   given only in the Word of God and in the inward experience which
   accords with this Word.

   In the second place, there was the definite way in which the "Word of
   God" and the "experience" of it were grasped. For Luther the "Word" did
   not mean Church doctrine; it did not even mean the Bible; it meant the
   message of the free grace of God in Christ which makes guilty and
   despairing men happy and blessed; and the "experience" was just the
   certainty of this grace. In the sense in which Luther took them, both
   can be embraced in one phrase: the confident belief in a God of grace.
   They put an end--such was his own experience, and such was what he
   taught to all inner discord in a man; they overcome the burden of every
   ill; they destroy the sense of guilt; and, despite the imperfection of
   a man's own acts, they give him the certainty of being inseparably
   united with the holy God:


     Now I know and believe

     And give praise without end

     That God the Almighty

     Is Father and Friend,

     And that in all troubles,

     Whatever betide,

     He hushes the tempest

     And stands at my side.

   Nothing, he taught, is to be preached but the God of grace, with whom
   we are reconciled through Christ. Conversely, it is not a question of
   ecstasies and visions; no transports of feeling are necessary; it is
   faith that is to be aroused. Faith is to be the beginning, middle, and
   end of all religious fervour. In the correspondence of Word and faith
   "justification" is experienced, and hence justification holds the chief
   place in the Reformers' message; it means nothing less than the
   attainment of peace and freedom in God through Christ, dominion over
   the world, and an eternity within.

   Lastly, the third feature of this renewal was the great transformation
   which God's worship now inevitably underwent, God's worship by the
   individual and by the community. Such worship--this was obvious--can
   and ought to be nothing but putting faith to practical proof. As Luther
   declared over and over again, "All that God asks of us is faith, and it
   is through faith alone that He is willing to treat with us." To let God
   be God, and to pay Him honour by acknowledging and invoking Him as
   Father--it is thus alone that a man can serve Him. Every other path on
   which a man tries to approach Him and honour Him leads astray, and vain
   is the attempt to establish any other relation with Him. What an
   enormous mass of anxious, hopeful, and hopeless effort was now done
   away with, and what a revolution in worship was effected! But all that
   is true of God's worship by the individual is true in exactly the same
   way of public worship. Here, too, it is only the Word of God and prayer
   which have any place. All else is to be banished; the community
   assembled for God's worship is to proclaim the message of God with
   praise and thanksgiving, and call upon His name. Anything that goes be.
   yond this is not worship at all.

   These three points embrace the chief elements in the Reformation. What
   they involved was a renewal of religion; for not only do they denote,
   albeit in a fashion of their own, a return to Christianity as it
   originally was, but they also existed themselves in Western
   Catholicism, although buried in a heap of rubbish.

   But, before we go further, permit me two brief digressions. We were
   just saying that the community assembled for God's worship must not
   solemnise its worship in any other way than by proclaiming the Word and
   by prayer. To this, however, we must add, according to the Reformers'
   injunctions, that all that is to stamp this community as a Church is
   its existence as a community of the faith in which God's Word is
   preached aright. Here we may leave the sacraments out of account, as,
   according to Luther, they, too, derive their entire importance from the
   Word. But if Word and faith are the only characteristics of worship, it
   looks as if those who contend that the Reformation did away with the
   visible Church and put an invisible one in its place were right. But
   the contention does not tally with the facts. The distinction between a
   visible and an invisible Church dates back as far as the Middle Ages,
   or even, from one point of view, as far as Augustine. Those who defined
   the true Church as "the number of the predestined" were obliged to
   maintain that it was wholly invisible. But the German Reformers did not
   so define it. In declaring the Church to be a community of the faith in
   which God's Word is preached aright, they rejected all the coarser
   characteristics of a Church, and certainly excluded the visibility that
   appeals to the senses; but--to take an illustration--who would say that
   an intellectual community, for example, a band of young men all alike
   eagerly devoted to knowledge or the interests of their country, was
   "invisible," because it possesses no external characteristics, and
   cannot be counted on one's fingers? Just as little is the evangelical
   Church an "invisible" community. It is a community of the spirit, and
   therefore its "visibility" takes different phases and different degrees
   of strength. There are phases of it where it is absolutely
   unrecognisable, and others, again, where it stands forth with the
   energy of a power that appeals to the senses. It can never, indeed,
   take the sharp contours of a state like the Venetian republic or the
   kingdom of France,--such was the comparison which a great exponent of
   Catholic dogmatics declared to be applicable to his Church,--but as
   Protestants we ought to know that we belong, not to an "invisible"
   Church, but to a spiritual community which disposes of the forces
   pertaining to spiritual communities; a spiritual community resting on
   earth, but reaching to the Eternal.

   And now as to the other point: Protestantism maintains that,
   objectively, the Christian community is based upon the Gospel alone,
   but that the Gospel is contained in Holy Scripture. From the very
   beginning it has encountered the objection that, if that be so, and at
   the same time there be no recognised authority to decide what the
   purport and meaning of the Gospel is and how it is to be ascertained
   from the Scriptures, general confusion will be the result; that of this
   confusion the history of Protestantism affords. ample testimony; that
   if every man has a warrant to decide what the "true understanding" of
   the Gospel is, and in this respect is bound to no tradition, no
   council, and no pope, but exercises the free right of research, any
   unity, community, or Church is absolutely impossible; that the state,
   therefore, must interfere, or some arbitrary limit be fixed. That no
   Church possessing the Sacred Office of the Inquisition can arise in
   this way is certainly true; further, that to impose any external limits
   on a community from the inside is a simple impossibility. What has been
   done by the state or under pressure of historical necessities does not
   affect the question at all; the structures which have arisen in this
   way are, in the evangelical sense, only figuratively called "Churches."
   Protestantism reckons--this is the solution--upon the Gospel being
   something so simple, so divine, and therefore so truly human, as to be
   most certain of being understood when it is left entirely free, and
   also as to produce essentially the same experiences and convictions in
   individual souls. In this it may often enough make mistakes;
   differences of individuality and education may issue in very
   heterogeneous results; but still, in this its attitude, it has not up
   to now been put to shame. A real, spiritual community of evangelical
   Christians; a common conviction as to what is most important and as to
   its application to life in all its forms, has arisen and is in full
   force and vigour. This community embraces Protestants in and outside
   Germany, Lutherans, Calvinists, and adherents of other denominations.
   In all of them, so far as they are earnest Christians, there lives a
   common element, and this element is of infinitely greater importance
   and value than all their differences. It keeps us to the Gospel and it
   protects us from modern heathenism and from relapse into Catholicism.
   More than this we do not need; nay, any other fetter we reject. This,
   however, is no fetter, but the condition of our freedom. And when we
   are reproached with our divisions and told that Protestantism has as
   many doctrines as heads, we reply: "So it has, but we do not wish it
   otherwise; on the contrary, we want still more freedom, still greater
   individuality in utterance and in doctrine; the historical
   circumstances necessitating the formation of national and free churches
   have imposed only too many rules and limitations upon us, even though
   they be not proclaimed as divine ordinances; we want still more
   confidence in the inner strength and unifying power of the Gospel,
   which is more certain to prevail in free conflict than under
   guardianship; we want to be a spiritual realm and we have no desire to
   return to the fleshpots of Egypt; we are well aware that in the
   interests of order and instruction outward and visible communities must
   arise; we are ready to foster their growth, so far as they fulfil these
   aims and deserve to be fostered; but we do not hang our hearts upon
   them, for they may exist to-day and to-morrow give place, under other
   political or social conditions, to new organisations; let anyone who
   has such a Church have it as though he had it not; our Church is not
   the particular Church in which we are placed, but the societas fidei'
   which has its members everywhere, even among Greeks and Romans." That
   is the evangelical answer to the reproach that we are "divided," and
   that is the language which the liberty that has been given to us
   employs. Let us now return from these digressions to the exposition of
   the essential features of Protestantism.

   Protestantism was not only a Reformation but also a Revolution. From
   the legal point of view the whole Church system against which Luther
   revolted could lay claim to full obedience. It had just as much legal
   validity in Western Europe as the laws of the state themselves. When
   Luther burnt the papal bull he undoubtedly performed a revolutionary
   act--revolutionary, not in the bad sense of a revolt against legal
   ordinance which is also moral ordinance as well, but certainly in the
   sense of a violent breach with a given legal condition. It was against
   this state of things that the new movement was directed, and it was to
   the following chief points that its protest in word and deed extended.
   Firstly: It protested against the entire hierarchical and priestly
   system in the Church, demanded that it should be abolished, and
   abolished it in favour of a common priesthood and an established order
   formed on the basis of the congregation. What a range this demand had,
   and to what an extent it interfered with the previously existing state
   of things, cannot be told in a few sentences. To explain it all would
   take hours. Nor can we here show how the various arrangements actually
   took shape in the evangelical Churches. That is not a matter of
   fundamental importance, but what is of fundamental importance is that
   the "divine" rights of the Church were abolished.

   Secondly: It protested against all formal, external authority in
   religion; against the authority, therefore, of councils, priests, and
   the whole tradition of the Church. That alone is to be authority which
   shows itself to be such within and effects a deliverance; the thing
   itself, therefore, the Gospel. Thus Luther also protested against the
   authority of the letter of the Bible; but we shall see that this was a
   point on which neither he nor the rest of the Reformers were quite
   clear, and where they failed to draw the conclusions which their
   insight into fundamentals demanded.

   Thirdly: It protested against all the traditional arrangements for
   public worship, all ritualism, and every sort of "holy work." As it
   neither knows nor tolerates, as we have seen, any specific form of
   worship, any material sacrifice and service to God, any mass and any
   works done for God and with a view to salvation, the whole traditional
   system of public worship, with its pomp, its holy and semi-holy
   articles, its gestures and processions, came to the ground. How much
   could be retained in the way of form for aesthetic or educational
   reasons was, in comparison with this, a question of entirely secondary
   importance.

   Fourthly: It protested against sacramentalism. Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper it left standing, as institutions of the primitive Church, or,
   as it might be, of the Lord himself; but it desired that they should be
   regarded either as symbols and marks by which the Christian is known,
   or as acts deriving their value exclusively from that message of the
   forgiveness of sins which is bound up with them. All other sacraments
   it abolished, and with them the whole notion of God's grace and help
   being accessible in bits, and fused in some mysterious way with
   definite corporeal things. To sacramentalism it opposed the Word; and
   to the notion that grace was given by bits, the conviction that there
   is only one grace, namely, to possess God Himself as the source of
   grace. It was not because Luther was so very enlightened that in his
   tract "On the Babylonian Captivity" he rejected the whole system of
   sacramentalism,--he had enough superstition left in him to enable him
   to advance some very shocking contentions,--but because he had had
   inner experience of the fact that where "grace" does not endow the soul
   with the living God Himself it is an illusion. Hence for him the whole
   doctrine of sacramentalism was an infringement of God's majesty and an
   enslavement of the soul.

   Fifthly: It protested against the double form of morality, and
   accordingly against the higher form; against the contention that it is
   particularly well-pleasing to God to make no use of the powers and
   gifts which are part of creation. The Reformershad a strong sense of
   the fact that the world passes away with the lusts thereof; we must
   certainly not represent Luther as the modern man cheerfully standing
   with his feet firmly planted on the earth; on the contrary, like the
   men of the Middle Ages, he had a strong yearning to be rid of this
   world and to depart from the "vale of tears." But because he was
   convinced that we neither can nor ought to offer God anything but trust
   in Him, he arrived, in regard to the Christian's position in the world,
   at quite different theses from those which were advanced by the grave
   monks of previous centuries. As fastings and ascetic practices had no
   value before God, and were of no advantage to one's fellowmen, and as
   God is the Creator of all things, the most useful thing that a man can
   do is to remain in the position in which God has placed him. This
   conviction gave Luther a cheerful and confident view of earthly
   ordinances, which contrasts with, and actually got the upper hand of,
   his inclination to turn his back upon the world.

   He advanced the definite thesis that all positions in life--constituted
   authority, the married state, and so on, down to domestic
   service--existed by the will of God, and were therefore genuinely
   spiritual positions in which we are to serve God; a faithful
   maid-servant stands higher, with him, than a contemplative monk.
   Christians are not to be always devising how they may find some new
   paths of their own, but to show patience and love of neighbour within
   the sphere of their given vocation. Out of this there grew up in his
   mind the notion that all worldly laws and spheres of activity have an
   independent title. It is not that they are to be merely tolerated, and
   have no right to exist until they receive it from the Church. No! they
   have rights of their own, and they form the vast domain in which the
   Christian is to give proof of his faith and love; nay, they are even to
   be respected in places which are as yet ignorant of God's revelation in
   the Gospel.

   It was thus that the same man who asked nothing of the world, so far as
   his own personal feelings were concerned, and whose soul was troubled
   only by thought for the Eternal, delivered mankind from the ban of
   asceticism. He was thereby really and truly the life and origin of a
   new epoch, and he gave it back a simple and unconstrained attitude
   towards the world, and a good conscience in all earthly labour. This
   fruitful work fell to his share, not because he secularised religion,
   but because he took it so seriously and so profoundly that, while in
   his view it was to pervade all things, it was itself to be freed from
   everything external to it.

LECTURE XVI

   THE question has often been raised whether, and to what extent, the
   Reformation was a work of the German spirit. I cannot here go into this
   complicated problem. But this much seems to me to be certain, that
   while we cannot, indeed, connect Luther's momentous religious
   experiences with-his nationality, the results positive as well as
   negative with which he invested them display the German--the German man
   and German history. From the time that the Germans endeavoured to make
   themselves really at home in the religion handed down to them--this did
   not take place until the thirteenth century onwards--they were
   preparing the way for the Reformation. And just as Eastern Christianity
   is rightly called Greek, and the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of
   Western Europe is rightly called Roman, so the Christianity of the
   Reformation may be described as German, in spite of Calvin. For Calvin
   was Luther's pupil, and he made his influence most lastingly felt, not
   among the Latin nations but among the English, the Scotch, and the
   Dutch. Through the Reformation the Germans mark a stage in the history
   of the Universal Church. No similar statement can be made of the Slays.

   The recoil from asceticism, which as an ideal never penetrated the
   Germans to the same extent as other nations, and the protest against
   religion as external authority, are to be set down as well to the
   Pauline Gospel as to the German spirit. Luther's warmth and heartiness
   in preaching, and his frankness in polemical utterance, were felt by
   the German nation to be an opening out of its own soul.

   In the previous lecture we touched upon the chief provinces in which
   Luther raised an emphatic and still effective protest. There is much
   upon which I could also dwell: for example, upon the opposition which,
   especially at the commencement of his reforming activity, he offered to
   the whole terminology of dogmatics, its formulae and doctrinal
   utterances. To sum up: he protested, because his aim was to restore the
   Christian religion in its purity, without priests and sacrifices,
   without external authorities and ordinances, without solemn ceremonies,
   without all the chains with which the Beyond was to be bound to the
   Here. In its revising ardour the Reformation went back not only earlier
   than the eleventh century, not only earlier than the fourth or the
   second, but to the very beginnings of religion. Nay, without being
   aware of it, the Reformation even modified or entirely put aside forms
   which existed even in the apostolic age: thus in matters of discipline
   it abolished fasting; in matters of constitution it abolished bishops
   and deacons; in matters of doctrine it abolished, among other things,
   Chiliasm.

   But with the change effected by Reformation and Revolution, how does
   the new creation stand as a whole in regard to the Gospel? We may say
   that in the four leading points which we emphasised in the previous
   lecture--inwardness and spirituality, the fundamental thought of the
   God of grace, His worship in spirit and in truth, and the idea of the
   Church as a community of faith--the Gospel was in reality re-won. Need
   I prove this in detail, or are we to be shaken in our conviction
   because, as is surely the case, a Christian in the sixteenth and in the
   nineteenth century presents an appearance different from that which a
   Christian presented in the first? That the inwardness and individualism
   which the Reformation disengaged accord with the character of the
   Gospel is certain. Further, Luther's pronouncement on justification not
   only reflects in the main, and in spite of certain irreducible
   differences, Paul's train of thought, but is also, in point of aim, in
   exact correspondence with Jesus' teaching. To know God as one's Father,
   to possess a God of grace, to find comfort in His grace and providence,
   to believe in the forgiveness of sins--in both cases that is the point
   on which everything turns. And in the troubled times of Lutheran
   orthodoxy a Paul Gerhardt succeeded in giving such grand expression to
   this fundamental conviction of the Gospel in his hymns, "Is God for me,
   then let all," and "Commit thy ways," as to convince us how truly
   Protestantism was penetrated with it. Again, that the right worship of
   God ought to be nothing but the acknowledgment of God in praise and
   prayer, but that the love of neighbour is also worship, is taken direct
   from the Gospel and Paul's corresponding injunctions. Lastly, that the
   true Church is held together by the Holy Ghost and by faith; that it is
   a spiritual community of brothers and sisters, is a conviction which is
   in line with the Gospel, and was most clearly expressed by Paul. In so
   far as the Reformation restored all this, and also recognised Christ as
   the only Redeemer, it may in the strictest sense of the word be called
   evangelical; and in so far as these convictions, crippled and burdened
   though they may be, retain their ascendency in the Protestant Churches,
   they have every warrant for being so described.

   But what was here achieved had its dark side as well. If we ask what
   the Reformation cost us, and to what extent it made its principles
   prevail, we shall see this dark side very clearly.

   We get nothing from history without paying for it, and for a violent
   movement we have to pay double. What did the Reformation cost us? I
   will not speak of the fact that the unity of Western civilisation was
   destroyed, since it was, after all, only over a part of Western Europe
   that the Reformation prevailed, for the freedom and many-sided
   character of the resulting development brought us a greater gain. But
   the necessity of establishing the new Churches as State-Churches was
   attended by serious disadvantages. The system of an ecclesiastical
   state is, of course, worse, and its adherents have truly no cause to
   praise it in contrast with the State-Churches. But still the
   latter--which are not solely the outcome of the breach with
   ecclesiastical authority, but were already prepared for in the
   fifteenth century--have been the cause of much stunted growth. They
   have weakened the feeling of responsibility, and diminished the
   activity, of the evangelical communities; and, in addition, they have
   aroused the not unfounded suspicion that the Church is an institution
   set up by the state; and accordingly to be adjusted to the state. Much
   has happened, indeed, in the last few decades to check that suspicion
   by the greater independence which the Churches have obtained; but
   further progress in this direction is necessary, especially in regard
   to the freedom of individual communities. The connexion with the state
   must not be violently severed, for the Churches have derived much
   advantage from it; but steps must be taken to further the development
   upon which we have entered. If this results in multifarious
   organisations in the Church, it will do no harm; on the contrary, it
   will remind us, in a forcible way, that these forms are all arbitrary.

   Further, Protestantism was forced by its opposition to Catholicism to
   lay exclusive emphasis on the inward character of religion, and upon
   "faith alone"; but to formulate one doctrine in sharp opposition to
   another is always a dangerous process. The man in the street is not
   sorry to hear that "good works" are unnecessary, nay, that they
   constitute a danger to the soul. Although Luther is not responsible for
   the convenient misunderstanding that ensued, the inevitable result was
   that in the reformed Churches in Germany from the very start there were
   accusations of moral laxity and a want of serious purpose in the
   sanctification of life. The saying, "If ye love me, keep my
   commandments," was unwarrantably thrust into the background. Not until
   the Pietistic movement arose was its central importance once more
   recognised. Up till then the pendulum of the conduct of life took a
   suspicious swing in the contrary direction, out of opposition to the
   Catholic "justification by works." But religion is not only a state of
   the heart; it is a deed as well; it is faith active in love and in the
   sanctification of life. This is a truth with which evangelical
   Christians must become much better acquainted, if they are not to be
   put to shame.

   There is another point closely connected with what I have just
   mentioned. The Reformation abolished monasticism, and was bound to
   abolish it. It rightly affirmed that to take a vow of lifelong
   asceticism was a piece of presumption; and it rightly considered that
   any worldly vocation, conscientiously followed, in the sight of God was
   equal to, nay, was better than, being a monk. But something now
   happened which Luther neither foresaw nor desired: "monasticism," of
   the kind that is conceivable and necessary in the evangelical sense of
   the word, disappeared altogether. But every community stands in need of
   personalities living exclusively for its ends. The Church, for
   instance, needs volunteers who will abandon every other pursuit,
   renounce "the world," and devote themselves entirely to the service of
   their neighbour; not because such a vocation is "a higher one," but
   because it is a necessary one, and because no Church can live without
   also giving rise to this desire. But in the evangelical Churches the
   desire has been checked by the decided attitude which they have been
   compelled to adopt towards Catholicism. It is a high price that we have
   paid; nor can the price be reduced by considering, on the other hand,
   how much simple and unaffected religious fervour has been kindled in
   home and family life. We may rejoice, however, that in the past century
   a beginning has been made in the direction of recouping this loss. In
   the institution of deaconesses and many cognate phenomena the
   evangelical Churches are getting back what they once ejected through
   their inability to recognise it in the form which it then took. But it
   must undergo a much ampler and more varied development.

   Not only had the Reformation to pay a high price; it was also incapable
   of perceiving all the conclusions to which its new ideas led, and of
   giving them pure effect. It is not that the work which it did was not
   absolutely valid and permanent in every particular--how could that be,
   and who could desire it to have been so? No! it remained stationary in
   its development even at the point at which, to judge by the earnest
   foundation that was laid at the start, higher things might have been
   expected. Various causes combined to produce this result. From the year
   1526 onwards national Churches had to be founded at headlong speed on
   evangelical lines; they were forced to be "rounded and complete" at a
   time when much was still in a state of flux. Then again, a mistrust of
   the left wing, of the "enthusiasts," induced the Churches to offer an
   energetic resistance to tendencies which they could have accompanied
   for a good bit of their way. Luther's unwillingness to have anything to
   do with them, nay, the manner in which he became suspicious of his own
   ideas when they coincided with those of the "enthusiasts," was bitterly
   avenged and came home to the evangelical Churches in the Age of
   Enlightenment. Even at the risk of being reckoned among Luther's
   detractors, we must go further. This genius had a faith as robust as
   Paul's, and thereby an immense power over the minds and hearts of men;
   but he was not abreast of the knowledge accessible even in his own
   time. The naïve age had gone by; it was an age of deep feeling, of
   progress, an age in which religion could not avoid contact with all the
   powers of mind. In this age it was his destiny to be forced to be not
   only a reformer but also an intellectual and spiritual leader and
   teacher. The way of looking at the world and at history he had to plan
   afresh for generations; for there was no one there to help him, and to
   no one else would people listen. But he had not all the resources of
   clear knowledge at his command. Lastly, he was always anxious to go
   back to the original, to the Gospel itself, and, so far as it was
   possible to do it by intuition and inward experience, he did it;
   moreover, he made some admirable studies in history, and in many places
   broke victoriously through the serried lines of the traditional dogmas.
   But any trustworthy knowledge of the history of those dogmas was as yet
   an impossibility, and still less was any historical acquaintance with
   the New Testament and primitive Christianity attainable. It is
   marvellous how, in spite of all this, Luther possessed so much power of
   penetration and sound judgment. We have only to look at his
   introductions to the books of the New Testament, or at his treatise on
   "Churches and Councils." But there were countless problems of which he
   did not even know, to say nothing of being able to solve them; and so
   it was that he had no means of distinguishing between kernel and husk,
   between what was original and what was of alien growth. How can we be
   surprised, then, if in its doctrine, and in the view which it took of
   history, the Reformation was far from being a finished product; and
   that, where it perceived no problems, confusion in its own ideas was
   inevitable? It could not, like Pallas Athene, spring complete from
   Jupiter's head; as doctrine it could do no more than mark a beginning,
   and it had to reckon on future development. But by being rapidly formed
   into national Churches it came near to itself cutting short its further
   development for all time.

   As regards the confusion and the checks which it brought upon itself,
   we must content ourselves with referring to a few leading points.
   Firstly, Luther would admit nothing but the Gospel, nothing but what
   frees and binds the consciences of men, what everyone, down to the
   man-servant and the maidservant, can understand. But then he not only
   took the old dogmas of the Trinity and the two natures as part of the
   Gospel--he was not in a position to examine them historically--and even
   framed new ones, but he was absolutely incapable of making any sound
   distinction between "doctrine" and Gospel; in this respect falling far
   behind Paul. The necessary result was that intellectualism was still in
   the ascendant; that a scholastic doctrine was again set up as necessary
   to salvation; and that two classes of Christians once more arose: those
   who understand the doctrine, and the minors who are dependent on the
   others' understanding of it.

   Secondly, Luther was convinced that that alone is the "Word of God"
   whereby a man is inwardly born anew--the message of the free grace of
   God in Christ. At the highest levels to which he attained in his life
   he was free from every sort of bondage to the letter. What a capacity
   he had for distinguishing between law and Gospel, between Old and New
   Testament, nay, for distinguishing in the New Testament itself! All
   that he would recognise was the kernel of the matter, clearly revealed
   as it is in these books, and proving its power by its effect on the
   soul. But he did not make a clean sweep. In cases where he had found
   the letter important, he demanded submission to the "it is written";
   and he demanded it peremptorily, without recollecting that, where other
   sayings of the Scriptures were concerned, he himself had declared the
   "it is written" to be of no binding force.

   Thirdly, grace is the forgiveness of sins, and therefore the assurance
   of possessing a God of grace, and life, and salvation. How often Luther
   repeated this, always with the addition that what was efficacious here
   was the Word--that union of the soul with God in the trust and
   childlike reverence which God's Word inspires; it was a personal
   relation which was here involved. But the same man allowed himself to
   be inveigled into the most painful controversies about the means of
   grace, about communion and infant baptism. These were struggles in
   which he ran the risk of again exchanging his high conception of grace
   for the Catholic conception, as well as of sacrificing the fundamental
   idea that it is a purely spiritual possession that is in question, and
   that, compared with Word and faith, all else is of no importance. What
   he here bequeathed to his Church has become a legacy of woe.

   Fourthly, the counter-Church which, as was inevitable, rapidly arose in
   opposition to the Roman Church, and, under the pressure which that
   Church exercised, perceived, not without reason, that its truth and its
   title lay in the re-establishment of the Gospel. But whilst the
   counter-Church privily identified the sum and substance of its doctrine
   with the Gospel, the thought also stole in surreptitiously: We-that is
   to say, the particular Churches which had now sprung up--are the true
   Church. Luther, of course, was never able to forget that the true
   Church was the sacred community of the faithful; but still he had no
   clear ideas as to the relation between it and the visible new Church
   which had now arisen, and subsequent generations settled down more and
   more into the sad misunderstanding: We are the true Church because we
   have the right "doctrine." This misunderstanding, besides giving rise
   to evil results in self-infatuation and intolerance, still further
   strengthened that mischievous distinction between theologians and
   clergy on the one side, and the laity on the other, on which we have
   already dwelt. Not, perhaps, in theory, but certainly in practice, a
   double form of Christianity arose, just as in Catholicism; and in spite
   of the efforts of the Pietistic movement it still remains with us
   to-day. The theologian and the clergyman must defend the whole
   doctrine, and be orthodox: for the layman it suffices if he adheres to
   certain leading points and refrains from attacking the orthodox creed.
   A very well-known man, as I have been lately told, expressed the wish
   that a certain inconvenient theologian would go over to the
   philosophical faculty; "for then," he said, "instead of an unbelieving
   theologian we should have a believing philosopher." Here we have the
   logical outcome of the contention that in the evangelical Churches,
   too, doctrine is something laid down for all time, and that in spite of
   being generally binding it is a matter of so much difficulty that the
   laity need not be expected to defend it. But if we persist on this
   path, and other confusions become worse confounded and take firmer
   root, there is a risk of Protestantism becoming a sorry double of
   Catholicism. I say a sorry double, because there. are two things which
   Protestantism will never obtain, namely, a pope and monastic priests.
   Neither the letter of the Bible nor any belief embodied in creeds can
   ever produce the unconditional authority which Catholics possess in the
   Pope; and Protestantism cannot now return to the monastic priest. It
   retains .its national Churches and its married clergy, neither of which
   looks very stately by the side of Catholicism, if competition with
   Catholicism is what the evangelical Churches desire.

   Gentlemen, Protestantism is not yet, thank God, in such a bad way that
   the imperfections and confusions in which it began have got the upper
   hand and entirely stunted or stifled its true character. Even those
   among us who are convinced that the Reformation in the sixteenth
   century is something that is over and done with are by no means ready
   to abandon the momentous ideas on which it was based, and there is a
   large field in which all earnest evangelical Christians are in complete
   unanimity. But if those who think that the Reformation is done with
   cannot see that its continuance in the sense of a pure understanding of
   God's Word is a question of life and death for Protestantism--its
   continuance has already borne abundant fruit in associations like the
   Evangelical Union--let them at least promote the liberty for which
   Luther fought in his best days: "Let the minds of men rush one against
   another and strike; if some are meanwhile led astray--well! that is
   what we must expect in war; where there is battle and slaughter, some
   must fall and be wounded, but whoso fights honestly will receive the
   crown."

   The reason why the catholicising of the Protestant Churches--I do not
   mean that they are becoming papal; I mean that they are becoming
   Churches of ordinance, doctrine, and ceremony--is so burning a question
   is that three powerful forces are working together to further this
   development. First there is the indifference of the masses. The
   tendency of all indifference is to put religion on the same plane not
   only with authority and tradition, but also with priests, hierarchies,
   and the cult of ceremonies. It puts religion there, and then goes on to
   complain of the external character and stationary condition of
   religion, and of the "pretensions" of the clergy; nay, it is capable,
   apparently, at one and the same moment, of mingling those complaints
   with abuse, of contemptuously jeering at every active expression of
   religious feeling, and doing homage to every kind of ceremony. This
   kind of indifference has no understanding whatever for evangelical
   Christianity, instinctively tries to suppress it, and praises
   Catholicism at its expense. The second of the forces to be taken into
   consideration is what I may call "natural religion." Those who live by
   fear and hope; whose chief endeavour is to find some authority in
   matters of religion; who are eager to be rid of their own
   responsibility and want to be reassured; who are looking for some
   "adjunct" to life, whether in its solemn hours or in its worst
   distress, some aesthetic transfiguration, or some violent form of
   assistance till time itself assists--all these people are also, without
   being aware of it, putting religion on the Catholic plane; they want
   "something that they can lean upon," and a good deal else, too--all
   kinds of things to stir them up and help them; but they do not want the
   Christianity of the Gospel. But the Christianity of the Gospel in
   yielding to such demands becomes Catholic Christianity. The third force
   I mention unwillingly, and yet I cannot pass it over in silence; it is
   the State. We must not blame the state for setting chief store by the
   conservative influence which religion and the Churches exercise, and
   the subsidiary effects which they produce in respect of reverence,
   obedience, and public order. But this is just the reason why the state
   exercises pressure in this direction, protects all the elements of
   stability in the Churches, and seeks to keep them from every inner
   movement that would call their unity and their "public utility" in
   question; nay, it has tried often enough to approximate the Church to
   the police, and employ it as a means of maintaining order in the state.
   We can pardon this--let the state take the means of power wherever it
   can find them; but the Church must not allow itself to be made into a
   pliant instrument; for, side by side with all the desolating
   consequences to its vocation and prestige, it would thereby become an
   outward institution in which public order is of greater consequence
   than the spirit, form more important than matter, and obedience of
   higher value than truth.

   In the face of these three so different forces, what we have to do is
   to maintain Christian earnestness and liberty as presented in the
   Gospel. Theology alone is unavailing; what is wanted is firmness of
   Christian character. The evangelical Churches will be pushed into the
   background if they do not make a stand. It was out of such free
   creations as the Pauline communities were that the Catholic Church once
   arose. Who can guarantee that those Churches, too, will not become
   "Catholic" which had their origin in "the liberty of a Christian man"?

   That, however, would not involve the destruction of the Gospel: so
   much, at least, history proves. It would be still traceable, like a red
   thread in the centre of the web, and somewhere or other it would emerge
   afresh, and free itself from its entangling connexions. Even in the
   outwardly decorated but inwardly decayed temples of the Greek and Roman
   Churches it has not been effaced. "Venture onwards! deep down in a
   vault you will still find the altar and its sacred, ever-burning lamp!"
   This Gospel, associated as it was with the speculative ideas and the
   mystery-worship of the Greeks, yet did not perish in them; united with
   the Roman Empire, it held its own even in this fusion, nay, out of it
   gave birth to the Reformation. Its dogmatic doctrines, its ordinances
   of public worship, have changed; nay, what is much more, it has been
   embraced by the simplest and purest minds and by the greatest thinkers;
   it endeared itself to a St. Francis and to a Newton. It has outlived
   all the changing philosophies of the world; it has cast off like a
   garment forms and ideas which were once sacred; it has participated in
   the entire progress of civilisation; it has become spiritualised, and
   in the course of history it has learnt how to make a surer application
   of its ethical principles. In its original earnestness and in the
   consolation which it offers, it has come home to thousands in all ages;
   and in all ages, too, it has thrown off all its encumbrances, and
   broken down all barriers. If we were right in saying that the Gospel is
   the knowledge and recognition of God as the Father, the certainty of
   redemption, humility and joy in God, energy and brotherly love; if it
   is essential to this religion that the founder must not be forgotten
   over his message, nor the message over the founder, history shows us
   that the Gospel has, in point of fact, remained in force, struggling
   again and again to the surface.

   You will perhaps have felt that I have not entered into present
   questions, the relation, namely, of the Gospel to our present
   intellectual condition, our whole knowledge of the world, and our task
   therein. But to do this with any success in regard to the actual
   situation of affairs would require longer than a few fleeting hours. As
   regards the kernel of the matter, however, I have said all that is
   needful, for no new phase in the history of the Christian religion has
   occurred since the Reformation. Our knowledge of the world has
   undergone enormous changes--every century since the Reformation marks
   an advance, the most important being those in the last two; but, looked
   at from a religious and ethical point of view, the forces and
   principles of the Reformation have not been outrun or rendered
   obsolete. We need only grasp them in their purity and courageously
   apply them, modern ideas will not put any new difficulties in their
   way. The real difficulties in the way of the religion of the Gospel
   remain the old ones. In face of them we can "prove" nothing, for our
   proofs are only variations of our convictions. But the course which
   history has taken has surely opened up a wide province, in which the
   Christian sense of brotherhood must give practical proof of itself
   quite otherwise than it knew how, or was able, to do in the early
   centuries--I mean the social province. Here a tremendous task confronts
   us, and in the measure in which we accomplish it shall we be able to
   answer with a better heart the deepest of all questions--the question
   of the meaning of life.

   Gentlemen, it is religion, the love of God and neighbour, which gives
   life a meaning; knowledge cannot do it. Let me, if you please, speak of
   my own experience, as one who for thirty years has taken an earnest
   interest in these things. Pure knowledge is a glorious thing, and woe
   to the man who holds it light or blunts his sense for it! But to the
   question, Whence, whither, and to what purpose? it gives an answer
   to-day as little as it did two or three thousand years ago. It does,
   indeed, instruct us in facts; it detects inconsistencies; it links
   phenomena; it corrects the deceptions of sense and idea. But where and
   how the curve of the world and the curve of our own life begin,--that
   curve of which it shows us only a section, and whither this curve
   leads, knowledge does not tell us. But if with a steady will we affirm
   the forces and the standards which on the summits of our inner life
   shine out as our highest good, nay, as our real self; if we are earnest
   and courageous enough to accept them as the great Reality and direct
   our lives by them; and if we then look at the course of mankind's
   history, follow its upward development, and search, in strenuous and
   patient service, for the communion of minds in it, we shall not faint
   in weariness and despair, but become certain of God, of the God whom
   Jesus Christ called his Father, and who is also our Father.

  THE END.
