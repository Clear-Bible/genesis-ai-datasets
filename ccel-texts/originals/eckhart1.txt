   PREFACE

   The impossibility of completing my edition of Meister Eckhart as
   :][uickly as it has been at various times desired and as I should
   Tiyself have liked to do, as well as the wish no longer to withhold
   from scholars the writings of one of the deepest thinkers of all dme,
   has decided me to publish in the meantime the portion :?ontamcd in the
   text. The second part, with literary-historical introduction, notes,
   glossary, and various additions and appendices, will follow as soon as
   I can spare the time from my new duties.

   , This first instalment contains, with the exception of a few short )
   eees which I obtained only after it was printed, everything of

   ekhart's which, during eighteen years of tireless research, I have
   :&gt;een able to collect out of manuscripts and printed books. It is
   ittle enough compared with the works of Eckhart still known :o
   Tritheniius and of which he gives quite a long catalogue in his book De
   Scriptoribus Eedes, (s. Fabricii bibliotheca ccoles. llani- Durgh,
   1718, fol. pag. 130) ; but on the other hand what I offer rierc is at
   least three times the amount of what has hitherto been known, and the
   teaching, the philosojihie systern of this remarkable Trian can now be
   presented in a more definite and complete form ^haii it was possible to
   do from the scanty and untrustworthy lata possessed before.

   In order to give an account of the means within my reach and It the
   same time to give the reader some idea of the extent and lifTiculty of
   my work, I append a list of the jirinted matter and nanu scripts used,
   together with a statement of their contents irranged and numbered to
   correspond with my edition.

   I only know what the possessor has disclosed in his French mono- graph
   on Eckhart {Memoir es de Vacaddmie franc, mor, et polit. par savants
   Strangers, Paris, 1847. T. 2).

   With regard to the internal arrangement and ordering of my material I
   make the following observations. The broad division into Sermons,
   Tractates, Sayings was obvious. On the other hand it was diflicult to
   decide what sequence the sermons ought to follow. An arrangement which
   showed the changes in Eckhart's teaehi)]g in a logical manner was out
   of the question, and the same applies to putting them in order of age
   or time of delivery ; the data for this are wholly lacking. It is quite
   exceptional for Eckhart to make any reference to a previous sermon.
   Among the earliest of these sermons, belonging perhaps to the period of
   his Vicar-Generalship in Bohemia (about 1.307), I reckon those numbered
   105-110 from the Melk MS., L. 5. (No. 22.) In the superscription of
   these Eckhart is so called instead of Meistcr Eckhart, a designation
   which points to the time when the memory of his final years of study in
   Paris was still lively. These I have placed last, simply on the grounds
   that, like all the MSS. obtained from Austria, they seem to be much
   edited ; superheially, in diction, they certainly are and I think too
   their matter has been tampered with. As being the simplest arrangement,
   the liturgical order of the Gospels commended itself but here great
   diirieulties , were encountered the sermons being prefaced by texts
   chosen quite at random and as a rule all reference to the Sunday or
   festival is wanting. The titles of the old Basle edition arc for the
   most part arbitrary.

   I decided therefore to rely solely on my sources and the order in which
   their individual sermons were presented. With this end in view those
   manuscripts were chosen out which were specially distinguished for
   their age or authenticity, and from these again selection was made of
   those with superscriptions imputing them to Eckhart. In this way and in
   this way only I found it possible to enter into the genius and the
   method and the idiosyncrasy of Eckhart and gain a reliable standard
   whereby to determine those sermons which, though found among the
   authentic ones, were yet without his name. By this means I hope to have
   acquired the necessary ]&gt;ractice and familiarity with Eckhart's
   writings and I believe 1 need not fear that any important item of my
   collec- tion will ultimately prove to be wrongly attributed to Eckhart.

   The Sayings, with few exceptions, bear all the marks of authen- ticity
   and need no further verification. Only a couple of them are traceable
   to the complete sermons and tractates included, though most are
   fragments and portions of larger works. From this we can form some
   notion of the amount of Eckhart still lost to us.

   PREFACE

   IX

   With regard to the fourth section, which I have called Liher
   Positionum, I had no external evidence of Eckhart's authorship, but
   Eckhart's genius and characteristic outlook seem to me to be
   unmistakably shown in these arguments in which, in the form of
   dialogues between master and pupil, a series of weighty philo- sophical
   and theological questions are ventilated. Further, the separate items
   of this work which only loosely hang together, I have met with only
   among Eckhart's writings. The title I have borrowed from Trithemius'
   Catalogue (see above) ; it might have been made for it.

   Obviously my text is not all of equal value and correctness ; who could
   expect it ? With the numerous pieces preserved only in late and bad
   MSS. it was often impossible owing to the careless- ness of the scribe
   to unravel the manifold confusion of thought and connection ; how was I
   to restore and supply words and whole sentences which had been omitted
   ? I mean to comment in the Notes on the passages which seem to me to be
   corrupt and give the emendations and conjectures which I have found it
   inexpedient to publish with the text. Of another kind but no less great
   was my didiculty with those passages which certainly appeared in the
   best MSS. but showed considerable variations among themselves. How
   important these discrepancies often are the variants will show. In
   cases of this sort the recognition and isolation of the authentic* from
   the unauthentic later additions or distortions is rarely to be done
   with any certainty and for that reason I have sometimes adopted the
   expedient of putting the variants themselves in juxtaposition in the
   text.^

   As to the diction of the contents of this volume, which I have neither
   wished nor been able to give much order to, I have followed the oldest
   and best MSS. which, consistently with Eckhart's home and birthplace,
   Strassburg, are written almost entirely in the Alcmanic idiom : Middle
   German and the speech of Cologne do appear occasionally but
   notwithstanding Eckhart's long sojourn on the lower Rhine, only rarely
   and in late MSS.

   Stuttgart, ^th July 1857.

   The last two pages of Pfeiffer's Preface arc occupied with acknow-
   ledgments of the help and kindness received from professors,
   librarians, keepers of archives, etc. Among these appear the names of
   Wackernagel, P. Gall-Morel, Franz Hoffmann, and the Cardinal
   Prince-Bishop of Breslau, Melchior von Diepenbrock, ^ Many examples of
   this occur. See especially I, Ixxvi and II, xi.

   who never tired of lending me a helping hand.' He is especially
   grateful to the then Prefect of the Vatican Archives who enabled him to
   trace and placed at his disposal eight documents (s. Pertz. archiv 9,
   449) relating to Eckhart and of much importance as showing the
   relations of Eckhart with the Church, his position with regard to the
   Archbishop of Cologne and the justification of the latter for setting
   in motion the Inquisition against him, as well as for the history of
   the powerful spiritual movement which at the beginning of the
   fourteenth century took place on the Rhine.' All these documents he
   reserves for his projected volume of Notes, with the cxce])tiori of one
   short quotation from Eckliart's Declara- tion at Cologne, 13 Feb. 1327.
   This, together with other relevant documents, was afterwards published
   by Preger at the end of the first volume of his Geschichie der
   deutschen Mi/stik,

   Eckhart ^ (d. cir. 1327) has been ealled the lather of the German
   mystics,^ the philosophical creative genius of the German mystics ® and
   the father of German speculation.^ According to Dean Inge he is next to
   Plotinus the greatest j)hilosopher-mystic ' ^ and the most Plotinian of
   all Christian philosophers.^* lie was a learned ^ member of the
   Dominican or Preaching Order and sometime lector hihlicus at the
   University of Paris, then the Dominican College of St Jacob where he
   was given his title of Meister by Pope Honi- face VIII. But it was
   probably at Cologne that he graduated in the Scholasticism of Albertus
   Magnus (1205 -1281) and Thomas Aquinas (1226 -1274) whose system was at
   that time rapidly acquiring its hold. He held at different times
   important provincial posts and proved himself an able administrator and
   reformer of the numerous religious houses in his eare but it was
   principally at Strassburg and afterwards at Cologne that he established
   his great influence as a teacher and for an entire generation, with the
   boldest freedom, preached to the multitudes in the German tongue on
   topics bristling with difliculties for the orthodox faith.' For he had
   conceived the then novel idea of instructing the lait}^ and the many
   semi-religious communities and brotherhoods of that date--- Beguines,
   Beghards, Friends of God (Gottefifreunde), etc. -- no less than the
   religious of his Order, and for this purpose it was necessary to make
   the further innovation of using the vulgar tongue instead of Latin, the
   teaching medium of that day. Ilis success in expounding the abstruse
   tenets of the Scholastic philosophy in an undeveloped language which he
   had to supply with words and fashion to his needs, has earned for
   Eckhart the titles of father of the German language and the father of
   German philosophic ® prose. Ultimately the Church authorities became
   alarmed at the enthusiasm roused by his teaching and especially at its
   effect u))on the laity. He was accused of preaching to the people in
   their own language

   things that might lead to heresy ^ and this led to his excommunica-
   tion in 1329, after his death, on the general grounds of preaching to
   the laity the secrets of the Church, a list of seventeen specific
   heretical and eleven ohjectional doctrines being appended to the
   inditcment.2 T(^ the first accusation he replied : ^ If the ignorant
   are not taught they will never learn ' ; the business of the doctor is
   to heal.' The charge of heresy he strenuously denied and largely
   succeeded in rebutting while he lived. I protest in the presence of
   God,' he says, that I have always avoided with horror all error in
   matters of faith,' and he never made any recantation of his teaching
   although he publicly declared his willingness to retract any error that
   might be proved against him.'" TTis errors' appear to be the logical
   outcome of the system he taught. As Lasson says, lie taught what
   Dionysius and St Thomas taught . . . but he goes further than any of
   his predecessors and crosses the boundaries of Church dogma.'

   There is only the scantiest material for a biography of Eckhart. Of his
   birth neither date nor place is known. It is argued that he was born
   before 1200 either at Strassburg in Saxony, or at Hoclihcim in
   Thfiringia. The first known mention of his name is in a list of
   Professors at the University of Paris : /r. Echardus^ Tutonicus,
   licentiates per Bonifavium, 1302. In 1303 he was Provincial of the
   Order in Saxony, with its sixty convents, men's and women's. To this
   title he added in 1307 that of V^icar-General of Bohemia where he
   refonned the religious liouses. In 1311 he returned to Paris University
   and in 1312 began his long sojourn as head of the Order at Strassburg.
   Eight years later (1320) he is Prior of Frankfu rt. There is now some
   suspicion of his orthodoxy but the Order still supports him and he is
   given a Chair at the Dominican College in (Cologne where he enhances
   his reputation as a preacher. Here Tauler, Suso and Ruysbroeck probably
   heard him, and Tauler also at Strassburg. In 1325-6, suspicion of his
   teaching having revived, Nikolaus of Strassburg was appointed his
   special Inquisitor and his case came before the Inquisition in Venice.
   lie delivered his Protest before that body on 24 Jan. 1327, and on 13
   Feb. following made his public Declaration of orthodoxy in the
   Dominican Church at Cologne. This is the last date on which he is known
   to have been alive. The answer of the Inquisition to his appellation,
   refusing to accept it, is dated 22 Feb. 1327, and it is conjectured
   that he died soon after. He was excommunicated by the Bull of John
   XXII, 27 March 1329.

   After his excommunication in 1329 Eckliart gradually lost all but
   legendary fame and his writings survived mostly under other names. Five
   hundred years later, in 1829 , Gorres speaks of him as line figure
   chretienne presque mythique.' ^ But for at least two generations after
   his death his writings, secretly passed from hand to hand and
   frequently transcribed, fomied what Lasson calls the text-books of
   God-intoxicated piety.' To the preachers of his school, John Tauler (
   1300 - 1361 ), Suso ( 1300 - 1365 ), Ruysbrocck ( 1293 - 1381 ), all
   members of the Brotherhood of the Friends of God, and to others of less
   note, they were a veritable mine from which they drew not only
   inspiration but words, sayings, whole passages and even whole sermons.
   To the Basle 1521 edition of Tauler's sermons Adam Petri had appended a
   few pages of sermons under Eckliart 's own name and this led to his
   rediscovery by Schmidt in 1817 .- Taulcr's sermons were after- wards
   shown by Pfeiffer to be a valuable source of Eckhart's writings and
   tliis applies also to the works of Suso and Ruys- broeck to a less
   degree.

   Pfeiffer'^ collection of Eckhart's works is the earliest and still by
   lar the largest. He confined himself principally to writings in
   Alemanic, the High German dialect of Strassburg at that date, but there
   are a number of others in different dialects of German, a few in Latin,
   ^ and some in a mixture of the two.* Tlierc are often numerous variants
   of the same original, sometimes under Eckhart's^ name but often
   attributed toothers, e.g. Frankc von Koln, Hermann von Fritslar,
   Nikolaus von Landau, Johannes von Sterngassen, Kraft von Royberg, all
   belonging to the fourteenth century. The nauH's of David of Ausburg and
   Nikolaus of Strassburg might possibly be added but, as Pfeiffer points
   out, frequently the only test of authorship is the internal evidence of
   style and matter and this test has \ et to be, conclusively ajiplied. A
   few of Pfeiffer's attributions would seem to have been wrongly made and
   in some cases overworking has robbed the writing of its Eckhartian
   flavour. In the following translation the six last and doubtful sermons
   have been omitted and a few other numbers of Parts I and II hav^c been
   replaced by substitutes, either discoveries of Pfeiffer's or from
   independent sources.

   With regard to the authorship of these substitutes, I, Iviii, 11, xvii
   and xix, are attributed to Eckhart on the authority of Preger (see
   Geschichte, pp. 318 - 324 ) ; I, xii on that of Biittncr (sec M,
   EclxharVs Schriften, etc., vol. ii, p. 228 ). Tractate i (from the
   Jostes collection) is evidently by the same hand as II, xix and

   * Works of Suso, 1829. Quoted by Jundt.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   I, xliii by the same author as I, Ixxii. Sermon xlvi is found (sec
   Jostes, No. ;34) forming part of Pfeiffer's Tractate iv. Of the other
   substitutes, I, ix is a typical Eckhart fragment from Hermann von
   Fritslar's Das Jleiligenlehen (1349), a collection which must now be
   recognised as a source of Eckhart's writings (see also II, viii).
   Lastly, I, x and xv (from Spamer's Texie) appear to be compila- tions
   from Eckhart's works. This applies also to Greith's Second Book ^ from
   which I, Ixxxix is taken.

   NOTE ON SCHOLASTICISM

   The Scholastic movement originated in the schools founded by
   Charlemagne (742 -814). It aimed at reconciling the philosophies of
   Plato, Aristotle and the Neoplatonists - (Plotinus, Poq&gt;hyry,
   Proclus) with the doctrines of Christianity. The first and greatest
   period of Scholasticism, which culminated with Aquinas (d. 1274) and
   his Summa Theologica began with Scotus Erigcna (d. cir, 877) who
   translated into Latin the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius (sixth century)
   and in reviving his system popularised also the philosophy of Aristotle
   as known chiclly in the Latin translations of his works and of
   Porphyiy's which had been made by Boethius (d. 542). The tradition of
   Aristotle had also been handed down through the great Arabian
   Aristotelians represented later by Avicenna (d. 1037) and Avcrrocs (d.
   1193) the Latin translations of whose commen- tarics Aquinas appears to
   have used. Through the same Moliain- rnedan school came the so-called
   Theology of Aristotle^ really the Enneads (iv- vi) of Plotinus.
   Finally, Proclus exerted a profound influence on the Scholastic
   philosophy not only through the medium of Dionysius' writings but also
   directly through his own, for it was his Elements which, emanating from
   the Arabians under the name of the Liber de Cmisisy famous in the
   middle ages, was a favourite text-book in their schools.^

   ' Greith aitributea to »Suso, by a process of exclusion, the untitled
   work which forms his .SVeond Book. (See Die dculsche Mystiky pp. 81 and
   96.) The original of this is an early h f teen th -century MS. of 342
   small 4to pages from a Dominican Convent at St Gall, and roferonco to
   the various Eckhart collections shows it to be a Teaching System '
   mainly, if not wholly, com- piled from his writings.

   * Eckhart a New Philosophers' ? The Philosopher ' is Aristotle. Aquinas
   IS called J ho I )octor,' and * a heathen doctor ' is often, but by no
   means always, Averroes.

   THIS IS MEISTER ECKIIAllT FROM WHOM GOD NOTPIING HID

   Dum medium silentium tenerent omnia et nox in suo cursu medium Her
   haheret etc. {Sap. 18, 4). For wliilc all things were in

   quiet silenee and the night was in the midst of her (bourse, etc.' Here
   in time we make holiday because the eternal birth which God the Father
   bore and bears unceasingly in eternity is now born in time, in human
   nature. St Augustine says this birth is always happening. Hut if it
   happen not in me what does it profit me ? What matters is that it shall
   happen in me.

   ^Ve intend therefore to speak of this birth as taking place in us : as
   [)eing eonsum mated in tht \ irtuous soul : for it is in the ])erfect
   soul that God speaks his Word. What I shall say is true only of the
   [)erfceted man, of him who has walked and is still walking in the way
   of God : not ot the natural undisciplined man who is entirely remote
   from and unconscious of this birth.

   There is a saying of the wise man : When all things Jay in the midst of
   silence then leapt there down into me from on high, from the royal
   throne, a secret word.' This sermon is about this word.

   Concerning it three things arc to be noted. The first is, where- abouts
   in the soul God the Father speaks his Word, wliere she is receptive of
   this act, where this birth befalls. It is bound to be in the purest,
   loftiest, subtlest part of the soul. Verily, an God tlic Father in liis
   omnipotence had endowed tlie soul with a still nobler nature, had she
   receivad from him anything yet more exalted, then must the Fatlier have
   delayed this birth for the presence of this greater excellence, 'fhe
   soul in which this birth shall come to pass must be absolutely pure and
   must live in gentle fashion, quite peaceful and wholly introverted :
   not running out through the five senses into the manifoldness of
   creatures, but altogether within and harmonised in her summit. That is
   its place. Anything inferior is disdained by it.

   The second part of this discourse has to do with man's conduct

   3

   MEISTER ECKHART

   in relation to this act, this interior speaking, this birth : whether
   it is more profitable to co-opcrate in it -perhaps by creating in the
   mind an imaginary image and disciplining oneself thereon by reflecting
   that God is wise, omnipotent, eternal, or whatever else one is able to
   excogitate about God -- so that the birth may come to pass in us
   through our own exertion and merit ; or whether it is more profitable
   and conducive to this birth from the Father to shun all thoughts, words
   and deeds as well as all mental images and empty oneself, maintaining a
   wholly God-receptive attitude, such that one's own self is idle letting
   God work. Which conduct subserves this birth best ?

   The third point is the profit and how great it is, which accrues from
   this birth.

   Note in the first jilaee that in what I am about to say I intend to
   avail myself of natural proofs that ye yourselves can grasp, for though
   I put more faith in the scriptures than myself, nevertheless it is
   easier and better for you to learn by means of arguments that can be
   vc^rified.

   First we will take the words : In the midst of the silence there was
   spoken in me a secret word.'

   -- 13ut, Sir, where is the silence and where the place in which the
   word is spoken ?

   As I said just now, it is in the purest part of the soul, in the
   noblest, in her ground, aye in t he very essence of the soul. That is
   mid-silenee for thereinto no creature did ever get, nor any image, nor
   has the soul there either activity or understanding, therefore she is
   not aware of any image cither of herself or any creature. What- ever
   the soul effects she effects with her powers. When she under- stands
   she understands with her intellect. When she remembers she does so with
   her memory. When she loves she does so with her will. She works then
   with her powers and not with her essence. Now every exterior act is
   linked with some means. The power of seeing is brought into play only
   through the eyes ; elsewhere she can neither do nor liestow such a
   thing as seeing. And so with all the other senses : their operations
   arc always effected through some means or other, lint there is no
   activity in the essence of the soul ; the faculties she works with
   cTuanatc from the ground of the essence but in her actual ground there
   is mid-stillness ; here alone is rest and a habitation for this birth,
   this act, wherein God the Father speaks his Word, for it is
   intrinsically receptive of naught save the divine ess:*nce, without
   means. Here God enters the soul with his all, not merely with a part.
   God enters the ground of the soul. None can touch the ground of the
   soul but God only. No creature is admitted into her ground, it must
   stop outside in her powers. There it sees the image whereby it has been

   drawn in and found shelter. For when the soul-powers contact a creature
   they set to to make of the creature an image and likeness which they
   absorb. By it they know the creature. Creatures cannot go into the
   soul, nor can the soul know anything about a creature which she has not
   willingly taken the image of into herself. She approaches creatures
   through their present images ; an image being a thing that the soul
   creates with her powers. Be it a stone, a rose, a man, or anything else
   that she wants to know about, she gets out the image of it which she
   has already taken in and is thus enabled to unite herself with it. But
   an image rceeiv^cd in this way must of necessity enter from without
   through the senses. Consequently there is nothing so unknown to the
   soul as herself. The soul, says a philosoplier, can neither create nor
   absorb an image of herself. So she has nothing to know liersclf by.
   Iniages all enter through the senses, hence she can have no image of
   herself. She knows other things but not hcrsell'. Of nothing does she
   know so little as of herself, owing to this arrangement. Now thou must
   know that inwardly the soul is free from means and images, that is why
   God can freely unite with her without form or similitude. Thou caiist
   not but attribute to God without measure whatever power thou dost
   attribute to a master. The wiser and more powerful the master the more
   immediately is his work effected and the simpler it is. Man requires
   many instruments for his external works ; much preparation is needed
   (re he can bring them forth as he has imagined them. The sun and moon
   whose work is to give light, in their mastership perform this very
   swiftly : the instant their radiance is poured forth, all the ends of
   the world arc full of light. More exalted arc the angels, who need less
   means for their works and have fewer images. Tlie highest Seraph has
   but a single image. lie seizes as a unity all that his inferiors regard
   as manifold. Now God needs no image and has no image : witliout image,
   likeness or means does God work in the soul, aye, in Iier ground
   whereinto no image did ever get but only himself with his own essence.
   This no creature can do.

   -- How do(\s God the Father give birth to his Son in the soul ; like
   creatures, in image and likeness ?

   No, by my faith ! Imt just as he gives him birth in eternity and no
   otherwise.

   -- Well, but how docs he give him birth there ?

   See. God the Father has perfect insight into himself, profound and
   thorough knowledge of himself by means of himself, not by means of any
   image. And thus God the Father gives birth to his Son, in the very
   oneness of the divine nature. Mark, thus it is and in no other way that
   God the Father gives birth to his Son in the ground and essence of the
   soul and thus he unites himself

   with her. Were any image present there would not be real union and in
   real union lies thy whole beatitude.

   Now haply thou wilt say : But there is nothing innate in the soul save
   images.' No, not so ! If that were true the soul would never be happy,
   for God cannot make any creature wherein thou canst enjoy perfect
   happiness, else were God not the highest happiness and final goal,
   whereas it is his will and nature to be the alpha and omega of alk No
   creature can be happiness. And here indeed can Just as little be
   perfection, for perfection (perfect virtue that is to say) results from
   perfection of life. Therefore verily thou must sojourn and dwell in
   tliy essence, in thy ground, and there God shall mix thee with his
   simple essence without the medium of any image. No image represents and
   signifies itself: it stands for that of which it is the image. Now
   seeing that thou hast no image save of what is outside thee, therefore
   it is impossible for thee to be beatified by any image wliatsoevcr.

   The second point is, what it does behove a man to do in order to
   deserv'c and procure this birth to come to pass and be (*on- summated
   in him : is it better for him to do his part towards it, to imagine and
   think about (hxl, or should ho keep still in peace and quiet so that
   God can speak and act in him while he merety waits on God's operation ?
   At the same time I rep(at that this speaking, this act, is only for the
   good and perfect, those who have so absorbed and assimilated the
   essence of virtue that it emanates from them naturally, witliout their
   seeking ; and above all there must live in them the worthy life and
   lofty teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. Such are permitted to know
   that the very best and utmost of attainment in this life is to remain
   still and let God act and speak in thee. When the powars hav(' all been
   withdrawn from tJieir bodily forms and functions, then this \\ ord is
   spoken. Thus he says : ' in the midst of the silence the secret word
   was spoken to me.' The more completely thou art a})lc to in-draw thy
   faculties and forget those things and their images which thou has taken
   in, the more, that is to say, thou forgetlcst the creature, the nearer
   thou art to this and the more susceptible thou art to it. If only thou
   couldst suddenly be altogether unaware of things, aye, couldst thou but
   ])ass into oblivion of thine own existence as St Paul did when he said
   : Whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God
   knoweth ! ' Here the spirit had so entirely absorbed the faculties that
   it had forgotten the body : memory no longer functioned, nor
   understanding, nor the senses, nor even those powers whose duty it is
   to govern and grace the body ; vital warmth and energy w(re arrested so
   that the body failed not throughout the three days during which he
   neither ate nor drank. Even so fared Moses when he fasted forty days on
   the mount and

   was none the worse for it : on the last day he was as strong as on the
   first. Thus a man must abscond from his senses, invert his faculties
   and lapse into oblivion of things and of himself. Anent which a
   philosopher apostrophised the soul : Withdraw from the restlessness of
   external activities ! ' And again : Flee away and hide thee from the
   turmoil of outward occupations and inward thoughts for they create
   nothing but discord ! ' If God is to speak his Word in the soul she
   must be at rest and at peace ; then he speaks in the soul his Word and
   himself : not an image but himself. Dionysius says : God has no image
   nor likeness of himself seeing that he is intrinsically all good, truth
   and being.' God performs all his works, in himself and outside himself,
   simul- taneously. Do not fondly imagine that God, when he created the
   heavens and the earth and all creatures, lYiade one thing one day and
   another the next. Moses describes it thus it is true, never- theless he
   knew better : he did so merely on account of those who are incapable of
   understanding or conceiving otherwise. All God did was : he willed and
   they were. God works without instrument and without image. And the
   freer thou art from images the more receptive thou art to his interior
   operation ; and the more introverted and oblivious thou art the nigher
   thou art thereto. Dionysius exhorted his disciple Timothy in this sense
   saying ;

   Dear son Timothy, do thou with untroubled mind swing thyself up above
   thyself and above thy powers, above all modes and all existences, into
   the secret, still darkness, that thou mayest attain to the knowledge of
   the unknown super-divine God.' All things must be forsaken. God scorns
   to work among images.

   Now haply thou wilt say : What is it that God docs without images in
   the ground and essence ? ' That I am incapable of knowing, for my
   soul-powers can receive only in images ,* they have to recognise and
   lay hold of each thing in its appropriate image : they cannot recognise
   a bird in the image of a man. Now since images all enter from without,
   this is concealed from my soul, which is most salutary for her.
   Not-knowing makes her wonder and leads her to eager pursuit, for she
   knows clearly that it is but knows not how nor xvhat it is. No sooner
   docs a man know the reason of a thing than immediately he tires of it
   and goes casting about for something new. Always clamouring to know, he
   is ever inconstant. The soul is constant only to this unknowing knowing
   which keeps her pursuing.

   The wise man said concerning this : " In the middle of the night when
   all things were in quiet silence there was spoken to me a hidden word.'
   It came like a thief, by stealth. What does he mean by a word that was
   hidden ? The nature of a word is to reveal what is hidden. It appeared
   before me, shining out with

   intent to reveal and giving me knowledge of God. Hence it is called a
   word. But what it was remained hidden from me. That was its stealthy
   coming in a whispering stillness to reveal itself.' It is just because
   it is hidden that one is and must be always after it. It appears and
   disappears : we are meant to yearn and sigh for it.

   St Paul says we ought to pursue this until wc espy it and not stop
   until we grasp it. When he returned after having been caught up into
   the third heaven where God was made known to him and where he beheld
   all things, he had forgotten nothing, but it was so deep down in his
   ground that his intellect could not reach it : it was veiled from him.
   He was therefore obliged to pursue it and search for it in himself, not
   outside himself. It is not outside, it is inside : wholly within. And
   being convinced of this he said, I am sure that neither death nor any
   affliction can separate me from what I find within me.'

   There is a fine saying of one heathen philosopher to another about
   this, he says : I am aware of something in me which sparkles in my
   intelligence ; I clearly perceive that it is somewhat but xsihat I
   cannot grasp. Yet methinks if I could only seize it I should know all
   tnith.' To which the other philosopher replied : Follow it boldly ! for
   if thou eanst seize it thou wilt possess the sum-total of all good and
   have eternal life ! ' St x\ugustine expresses himself in the same sense
   : 1 am conscious of something within me that plays before my soul and
   is as a light dancing in front of it ; were this brought to steadiness
   and perfection in me it would surely be eternal life ! ' It hides yet
   it shows. It comes, but after the manner of a thief, with intent to
   take and to steal all things from the soul. 13y emerging and showing
   itself somewhat it purposes to decoy the soul and draw it towards
   itself to rob it and take itself from it. As saith the prophet : ^ Lord
   take from them their spirit and give them instead thy spirit.' This too
   the loving soul meant when she said : My soul dissolved and melted away
   when Love spoke his word ; when he entered I could not but fail.' And
   Christ signified it by his words : Whoso- ever shall leave aught for my
   sake shall be repaid an hundredfold, and whosoever will possess me must
   deny himself and all things and whosoever will serve me must follow me
   nor go any more after his own.'

   Now peradventure thou wilt say : But, Sir, you are wanting to change
   the natural course of the soul ! It is her nature to take in through
   the senses, in images. Would you upset this arrangement ? '

   No ! But how knowest thou what nobility God has bestowed on human
   nature, what perfections yet uncatalogued, aye yet

   undiscovered ? Those who have written of the soul's nobility have gone
   no further than their natural intelligence could carry them : they
   never entered her ground, so that much remained obscure and unknown to
   them. I will sit in silence and hearken to what God speaketh within
   me,' said the prophet. Into this retirement steals the Word in the
   darkness of the night. St John says, The light shines in the darkness :
   it ciime unto its own and as many as received it became in authority
   sons ol God : to them was given power to become God's sons.'

   Mark now tlie fruit and use of this mysterious Word and of this
   darkness. In this gloom which is his own the heavenly Father's Son is
   not born alone : thou too art born lliere a cliild of the same heavenly
   Father and no other, and to thee also he gives power. Observe how great
   the use. No truth harncd by any master by his own intellect and
   understanding, or ever to be learned this side the day of judgment, has
   twer been interpreted at all according to this knowh^dge, in this
   ground, ( all it an tliou wilt an ignorance, an unknowing, yet there is
   in it more than in all knowing and undc'rstanding without it, for this
   outward ignorance lures and attracts thee irom all understood things
   and from tliysclf. This is what Christ meant wlieii he said : '
   Whosoever denieth not him- self and Icaveth not father and mother and
   is not estranged from all these, he is not worthy of me.' As though to
   say : he who aliandons not creatunly externals can neither be conceived
   nor born in tiiis divine birth. Ihit divesting thysell'of thyself and
   of every- thing external thereto does indeed give it thee. And in ver}^
   truth I believe, nay 1 am sure, that the man who is established herein
   can in no wise be at any lime separated from (xod. I hold he can in no
   wise lapse into mortal sin. lie would rather suffer the most slianicful
   death, as the saints have done before him, than commit the l(*ast of
   mortal sins. 1 hold that he cannot willingly commit, nor yet consent
   to, even a venial sin, whether in himself or in another. So strongly is
   he drawn and attracted to this way, so much is he habituated to it,
   that he eoukl ne\ er turn to any other : to this way are directed all

   birth befalls in the soul exactly as it does in eternity, neither more
   nor less, for it is the same birth : this birth befalls in the ground
   and essence of the soul.

   Certain questions arise. Granting that God is in all things as
   intelligence (or mind) and is more instinct in things than they are in
   themselves and more natural ; and granting that God wherever he is is
   in operation, knowing himself and speaking his Word, then mark in what
   respects the soul is better fitted for this divine operation than other
   rational creatures God exists in.

   God is in all things as being, as activity, as power. But he is
   procreative in the soul alone for though every creature is a vestige of
   God, the soul is the natural image of God. This image is perfected and
   adorned in this birth. No creature but the soul is susceptible to this
   birth, this act. Such perfection as enters the soul, whether it be
   divine light, grace or bliss, must needs enter the soul in this liirth
   and no otherwise. Do but foster this birth in thee and thou shalt
   experience all good and all comfort, all happiness, all being and all
   tnith. \Vhat comes to thee therein brings thee true being and stability
   and whatsoever thou mayst seek or grasp, without it, perishes, take it
   Iioav thou wilt. This alone gives life ; all else eorru2)ts. Moreover,
   in this birth thou dost j)articipate in the divine inllux and its
   gifts. This is not received by creatures wherein God \s image is not
   found : the soul- idea belongs to the eternal birth alone and this
   happens only and solely in the soul, begotten of the Father in the
   ground and innermost recesses of the soul whercinto never image shone
   nor soul-power peeped.

   Another question is : If this birth befalls in the ground and essence
   of the soul, then it happens alike in sinner and in saint, so what use
   or good is it to me ? The ground of nature is the same in both, nay
   even in hell the nobility of nature persists eternally. -- It is
   characteristic of this birth that it always comes with fresh light. It
   always brings great (mlightcnment to the soul because it is the nature
   of good to diffuse itself. In this birth (iod pours into the soul in
   such abundance of light, the ground and essence of the soul arc so
   Hooded with it, that it nins over into her powers and into the outward
   man as well. Thus it befell Paul when iqion his journey God touched him
   with his light and spake to him : the reflection of this light showed
   outwardly so that his companions saw it surrounding Paul like the
   saints. The sujjerfluitv of light in the ground of the soul wells over
   into the body which is tilled with radiance. No sinner can receive this
   light nor is he worthy to, being full of sin and wickedness, or
   darkness. As he (John) says, The darkness neither receives nor
   comprehends the light.' Because the

   avenues by which the li^^ht would enter are choked and obstmeted with
   guile and darkness. Light and darkness are incompatible, like God and
   creatures. Enter God, exit creatures. Man is quite conscious of this
   light. Directly he turns to God this light begins to glint and sparkle
   in him, telling him what to do and what to leave undone, with many a
   shrewd hint to boot of things he hitherto ignored and knew nothing of.
   -- IIow dost thou know ? -- Suppose thy heart is vehemently moved to
   retire from the world. IJow could that be if not by this light ? It is
   so cEarming, so delightful, it makes other tbings so tiresome which are
   not God or God's. It attracts thee to God and thou art sensible of many
   a virtuous impulse all)cit uncertain whence it comes. This interior
   mood is in no wise due to creatures nor is it any of their bidding, for
   what creatures effect and direct comes in from without. But thy ground
   alone is stirred by this force and the freer thou dost keep the more
   truth and discernment are thine. No man w^as ever lost save for tbc
   reason that once having left his ground he has let himself become too
   permanently settled abroad. St Augustine says : Many there be that have
   sought light and truth but only abroad where they arc not. They linally
   go out so far that they never get back nor find their way in again.
   Neither have these found the truth for the truth is within in their
   ground, not without. So he who means to see this light and find out the
   whole truth must foster the awarciK^ss of this birth within himself, in
   his ground, so shall his powers all be lighted up and his outer man as
   well. I)ire(dly God inwardly stirs his ground with the truth its light
   darts into his powers, and lo, that man knows more than anyone could
   teach liim. As the prophet says, I know more than I was ever taught.'
   It is because this light cannot lighten and shine in sinners that this
   birth cannot occur in them. This birth is inconsistent with darkness
   and sin therefore it befalls not in the powers but in the ground and
   essence of the soul.

   Then conu'S the question : If God the Father labours only in the ground
   and essence of the soul, not in her powers, what have the powers got to
   do w ith it ? How do they help by being idle and taking holiday ? What
   is the use, seeing this birth befalls not in the powxrs ? -- It is w(ll
   asked. But consider. Every creature works towards some end. The end is
   ever the first in intention and the last in execution. And God too
   works for a wholly blessed end, to wit, himself : to bring the soul and
   all her powers into that end, into himself. For this God's w^orks are
   wrought, for this the Father brings his Son to birth in the soul, that
   all the powers of the soul may end in this. lie lies in wait for all
   the soul contains, all arc bidden to his royal feast. Here, the soul is
   scattered abroad among her powers and dissipated in the act of

   each : the power of seeing in the eye, the power of hearing in the ear,
   the power of tasting in the tongue, and her powers arc accord- ingly
   enfeebled for their interior work, scattered forces being imperfect. It
   follows that for her interior work to be effective, she must call ill
   all her powers, recollecting them out of extended things to one
   interior act. St Augustine says, The soul is where she loves rather
   than where she animates the body.' Once upon a time thci'c was a
   heathen philosopher who studied mathematics. He was sitting by the
   embers making (alculations in pursuance of his art when there came
   along a man brandishing a sword, who, not witting that it was the
   master, cried out, Quick, thy name, or I shall slay thee ! ' The master
   was too much absorbed to see or hear his enemy and failed to cat(h the
   threat. So after hailing him several times the enemy cut off his head.
   And tliis to acquire a mere natural science ! How much more does it
   behove us to withdraw from things in order to concentrate our powers on
   perceiving and knowing the one infinite and immortal truth ! To this
   end do thou assemble thy entire mind and memory ; turn them into the
   ground where thy treasure lies hid. Hut for this thou must drop all
   other activities ; thou must get to unknowing to find it.

   The question is, Were it not better for each power to go on with its
   own work, then none would hinder the otlu rs in their work nor yet God
   in his V Can there not be ercaturely knowledge in me that is no
   hindrance, as God knows all things without hindrance and so do the
   saints ? -- 1 answer : The saints behold God in a simple image and in
   that im.agc they discca'n all things ; and God himself secs himself
   thus, perceiving all things in himself. He need not turn, as wc do,
   from one thing to another. Supposing that in this life w(* were always
   confronted with a mirror wherein we see and recognise all things at a
   glance in one single image : neither act nor knowledge would be a
   hindrance then. At present we must turn from one thing to anotlua' : we
   can only mind one thing at the expense of all tlic others. And the soul
   is bound so straitly to her powers that where they How she must flow
   with them ; the soul must be present at everything they do, and
   attentive too, or nothing would &lt;?ome of their exertions. The drain
   of attending to external acts is bound to weaken her interior
   operation. For this nativity God wants, and he must have, a vacant,
   free and unencumbered soul wherein is nothing but himself alone, w^hich
   waits for naught and nobody but him. As Christ says : Whoso lovcth
   aught but me, whoso eleaveth to father or mother, or many other things,
   he is not worthy of me. I came not upon earth to bring peace but a
   sword ; to cut away all things, to part thee from brother, child,
   mother and friend, which are really thy foes.' For verily thy comforts

   thine eye see all things and thine ear hear all things and thy heart
   remember them all, then in these things thy soul is destroyed.

   A master says, To achieve the interior act one must assemble all one's
   powers as it were into one corner of one's soul, where, secreted from
   images and forms one is able to work. We must sink into oblivion and
   ignorance. In this silence, this quiet, the Word is heard. There is no
   better method of approaching this Word than in silence, in quiet : we
   hear it and know it aright in unknowing. To one who knows naught it is
   clearly revealed.

   Haply thou wilt object : You place our salvation in ignorance. Sir.
   That seems a mistake. God made man to know : " Lord make them to know,"
   says the prophet. Where there is ignorance there is defect and illusion
   : he is a brutish man, an ape, a fool, and so remains as long as he is
   ignorant.' But this is transformed knowledge, not ignorance which comes
   from lack of knowing ; it is by knowing that we get to this unknowing.
   Then we know with divine knowing, then our ignorance is ennobled and
   adorned with supernatural knowledge. Then in our passion we are more
   perfect than in action. According to one authority, the sense of
   hearing is much nobler than the sense of sight, for we learn wisdom
   more by car than eye and live this life more wisely. We read about a
   heathen philosopher who was lying at death's door while his pupils were
   discussing in his presence some noble science, that, lifting up his
   dying head and listening, he ex(;laimed, O teach me even now this art
   that I may practise it eternally ! ' Hearing draws in more, seeing
   leads out more, the very act of seeing. In eternal life we are far more
   ha})py in our ability to hear than in our power to see, because the act
   of hearing the eternal Word is in me, whereas the act of seeing goes
   forth from me : hearing, I am receptive ; seeing, I am active. But our
   bliss docs not consist in being active but in being receptive to God.
   As God excels creature, so is God's work more excellent than mine. It
   was out of love that God did set our happiness in suffering, for we
   undergo far more than we do and receive incomparably more than n return
   we give ; moreover, each divine gift is the preparation for some new
   and richer gift, each gift increasing our capacity and our desire to
   receive a greater still. Some theologians say that the soul is
   symmetrical with God in this respect. For as God is infinite in giving,
   so the soul is infinite in receiving or conceiving. And the soul is as
   profound to suffer as God is omnipotent to act, hence her
   transformation by God into God. God must act and the soul must suffer ;
   for him to know and love himself in her, for her to know with his
   knowledge, love with his love ; and since she is far happier in his
   than hers it follows that her happiness depends upon his work more than
   on her own.

   The pupils of St Dionysius asked him why Timothy outstripped them in

   THIS TOO IS MEISTER ECKHART WHO ALWAYS TAUGHT THE TRUTH

   In hisy quee patris rnei sunt, oportet me esse (l,nc, 2jy). I must

   be about my Father's business.' This text is opportune to what we have
   to say concerning the eternal birth which took place here in time and
   is still happening daily in the innermost recesses of the soul, in her
   ground, remote from all comers. To become aware of this interior birth
   it is above all necessary to be about our Father's business.

   What is pecxiliarly the Father's ? Power is ascribed to him beyond
   either of the other Persons. And I tell you, no one can experience this
   birth without a mighty effort. None can attain this birth unless he can
   withdraw his mind entirely from things. And it requires main force to
   drive back all the senses and inhibit them. Violence must be offered to
   them one and all or this cannot be done. As Christ said : The kingdom
   of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force.'

   Regarding this birth there arises the question, Does it happen
   continuously or only at intervals when one is disposed for it, what
   time one is exerting oneself to the utmost to forget things altogether
   and be conscious in this ?

   Here let us discriminate. Man possesses an active intellect, a passive
   intellect and a potential intellect. Active intellect is ever in act,
   ever doing something, be it in God or in creature, to the honour and
   glory of God. That is its province and hence its name active. But when
   God undertakes the work the mind must preserve a state of passivity.
   Potential intellect again has regard to both these, to the action of
   God and the passion of the soul, to its acting potentially. In the one
   case the mind is active, when it is function- ing, to wit ; in the
   other receptive, when God takes up the work and

   then the mind ought, nay must, remain still and allow God to aet. Now
   ere this is begun by the mind and linishcd by God, the spirit has
   prevision of it, potential knowledge of its happening. This is the
   meaning of potential intellect, which, however, is often neglected and
   does not bear fruit. When the mind is exerting itself in real earnest,
   God interests himself in the mind and its work, and then the soul secs
   and experiences God. But since the un- interrupted vision and passion
   of God is intolerable to the soul in this body, therefore God withdraws
   from the soul from time to time, as it is said, A little while ye sec
   me, and again a little while and ye do not see me.'

   When our liord took his three disciples with him up the mountain and
   showed them the trans figuration of his body by union with the Godhead,
   which also we shall have in our archetypal body, straightway Peter,
   beholding it, was fain to remain there always. Verily, where we And
   good we are loath to leave it, in so far as it is good. Where intuition
   finds, love follows and memory and all the soul to boot. And our l.ord
   knowing this hides himself sometimes ; for the soul is the impartible
   form of the body, so she turns as a whole to whatever she turns. Were
   she conscious of good, God to wit, immediately, unintermptedly, she
   would never be able to leave it to infiuence the body.

   Thus it befell Paul : had lie remained a hundred years there, where he
   knew the good, he would never have returned to his body, he would have
   forgotten it completely. Seeing then that it is wholly foreign to this
   life, and inconijiatible therewith, the good God veils it when he will
   and unveils it again when he chooses and when he knows, like a trusty
   physician, that it is best and most useful for thcc. This withdrawal is
   not thine, but his whose is also the work ; let him do it or not as he
   will, he knows what is good for thee. It is in his hands to show or not
   accordiiig as he knows thee able to endure it. God is not a destroyer
   of nature, he perfects it, and this God does ever more and more as thou
   art fitted for it.

   Haply thou wilt object : Alas, Sir, if this requires a mind quite free
   from images and without activity, albeit both are natural to its
   powers, then how about those outward works we must do sometimes, works
   of charity, external ones, such as teaching and comforting those in
   need thereof : are we debarred by these ? things which so occupied our
   Lord's disciples, notably St Paul, who endured a father's care on
   account of other people : are we to be deprived of this great good
   because we arc engaged in charities ?

   The answer is this. The one is perfect, the other very profitable. Mary
   was praised for choosing the best, but Martha's life was very useful,
   serving Christ and his disciples. 8t Thomas says the

   active life is better tlian the life of contemplation, so far as we
   actually spend in charity the income we derive from contemplation. It
   is all the same tiling ; wc have but to root ourselves in this same
   ground of contemplation to make it fruitful in works, and the object of
   contemplation is achieved. True, there is motion, but no more than one
   ; it conics from one end, God, and goes back to the same. As though I
   went from one end to th«^ other of this house ; that would in sooth be
   motion, but of one in the same. Even so in this activity wc are in the
   state of contemplation in God. I'he one is centred in the other and
   perfects the other. God's puqDose in the union of contemplation is
   fruitfulness in works ; for in contemplation thou servest thyself
   alone, but the many in good works.

   Hereto Christ admonisheth us by his whole life and the lives of all his
   saints, every one of whom he drove forth into the world to teach the
   multitude. St Paul said to Timothy, Beloved, preach the Word.' Did he
   mean the outward word that beats the air ? Nay, surely ! He meant the
   in-born, hidden Word that lies secreted in the soul ; it was this that
   he exhorted them to preach, to the end that it might be made known to
   and nourish the powers of such as spend themselves wholly in the
   exterior life. That what time thy fellow-man hath need of thee thou
   niayst be found ready to serve him to the best of thy ability. It must
   be within thee, in thought, in intellect and will, and shine forth in
   thy deeds. As Christ said, Let your light shine before men.' He was
   thinking of those people who (*are only for the contemplative life and
   neglect the virtuous uses of it, which, they say, do not concern them,
   they are passcxl that stage. Not these had Christ in mind when he
   observed : The seed fell upon good ground and yielded fmit an
   hundredfold,' but these he meant when he declared : The tree that
   bcareth not fruit shall be cut down.'

   Thou mayst object : Hut, Sir, what of that silence you said so much
   about ? This means images galore. Every one of these acts has its
   ayjpropriate image, be the act internal or external ; whether it be
   teaching one or comforting another or arranging this or that, so what
   quiet can I get withal ? If the mind sees and formulates and the will
   wills and memory holds it fast, does not all this necessitate ideas ? '

   Let me explain. We were speaking just now of the active intellect and
   the passive intelle(!t. Active intellect abstracts the images of
   outward things, stripping them of matter and of accidents, and
   introduces them to the passive intellect, begetting their mental
   prototypes therein. And the passive intellect made pregnant by the
   active in this way, knows and cherishes these things with the help of
   active intellect. Passive intellect cannot keep on

   knowing things unless the active intellect keeps on enlightening it.
   Now observe. What the active intellect does for the natural man that
   and far more does God do for the solitary soul : he turns out active
   intellect and installing himself in its stead he himself assumes the
   duties of the active intellect.

   When a man is quite idle, when his intellect is at rest within him,
   then God takes up the work : he himself is the agent who produces
   himself in the passive intellect. What happens is this. The active
   intellect cannot give what it has not got : it cannot have two ideas
   together, but first one and then the other. What though light and air
   sliow multitudes of forms and colours all at once, thou canst only
   observe them one after another. And so with thy active intellect, which
   resembles the eye. But when God acts in lieu of thy active intellect he
   engenders many images together in one point. Suppose God prompts thee
   to some one good deed, thy powers are all proffered for all virtuous
   things, thy mind being straightway set on good in general. All thy
   possibilities for good take shape and come into thy mind collectively,
   focussed to one point. Clearly this is not the work of thine own
   intellect which has in no wise the perfection nor plenitude for it ;
   rather is it the work and product of him who has all forms at once in
   himself. As Paul says : I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me
   ; in him I am undivided.' Know then, the ideas of these acts are not
   thine own : they belong to the author of thy nature who has planted
   therein both their energy and form. Lay no claim thereto, for it is his
   not thine. True, thou rcccivest it temporally, but it is gotten and
   born of God beyond time', in eternity above images.

   Thou wilt say, perhaps : From the moment my intellect is divested of
   its natural activity and no longer has either form or action of its
   own, what is preserving it ? It must have a hold somewhere ; the
   powers, whether memory, intellect or will, are bound to have some
   lodgment somewhere, some place to work in.

   The answer is this. Intellect's object and sustenance is essence, not
   accident, just pure unadulterated being in itself. On descrying
   something real the intellect forthwith relics upon it, comes to rest
   thereon, pronouncing its intellectual word concerning the object
   attained. As long as intellect fails to find the actual truth of
   things, does not touch bedrock in them, it stays in a condition of
   quest and expectation, it never settles down to rest, but labours
   incessantly to trace things to their cause, that is, it is seeking and
   waiting. It spends perhaps a year or more in research on some natural
   fact, finding out what it is, only to work as long again stripping off
   what it is not. All this time it has nothing to go by, it makes no
   pronouncement at all in the absence of experimental knowledge of the
   ground of truth. Intellect never rests in this

   life. However much God shows himself in this life it is nothing to what
   he really is. Truth lies in the ground, but veiled and concealed from
   the intellect. And meanwhile the mind has no support to rest on as on
   something permanent. It gets no rest at all, but goes on expecting and
   preparing for something still to come but so far hidden. There is no
   knowing what God is. Something we do know, namely, what God is not.
   This the dis- cerning soul rejects. Intellect, meantime, finding no
   satisfaction in any mortal thing, is waiting, as matter awaits form. As
   matter is insatiable for form, so is intellect unsatisfied except with
   the essential, all-embracing truth. Only the truth will do, and this
   God keeps withdrawing from it step by step, purposing to arouse its
   zeal and lure it on to seek and grasp the actual causeless good : that,
   not content with any mortal thing, she may clamour more and more for
   the highest good of all.

   But thou wilt say ; Alas, Sir, you laid so much stress on our quieting
   our faculties and now this calm resolves itself into yearn- ing and
   lamenting : to a muckle moan and clamour for something not possessed,
   which puts an end to peace and quiet. This may be desire or purpose or
   praise or thanksgiving or any of their brood, but it is not perfect
   peace and absolute stillness.'

   I answer that, when thou hast emptied thyself entirely of thine own
   self and all things and of every sort of selfishness and hast
   transferred, united and abandoned thyself to God in perfect faith and
   complete amity, then everything that is born in thee or that enters
   into thee, external or internal, joyful or sorrowful, sour or sweet, is
   no longer thine own at all, but is altogether thy God's to whom thou
   hast abandoned thyself. Tell me, whose is the spoken word ? His who
   speaks it or his who hears it ? Though it fall to the hearer it really
   belongs to the speaker, to him who gives it birth. The sun, for
   example, throws out light into the air and the air receives the light
   and transmits it to the earth. Now, although the light seems in the
   air, it is really in the sun : the light is actually from the sun,
   originating in the sun, not in the air : the air entertains it and
   passes it on to anything that can be lighted up. And so with the soul.
   God begets in the soul his ehild, his Word, and the soul conceiving it
   passes it on to her powers in varied guise, now as desire, now as good
   intent, now as eharit}^ now as gratitude, or as it may take thee : It
   is his, not thine at all. What is thus wrought by God take thou as his
   and not thine own, as it is written, The Holy Ghost asketh in us with
   unutterable yearnings.' He prays in us, not we ourselves. St Paul says,
   No one is able to say. Lord Jesus Christ, except in the Holy Ghost.*

   Above all, lay no claim to anything. Let go thyself and let

   God act for thee and in thee as he pleases. This work is his, this Word
   is his, this birth is his and all thou art to boot. For thou hast
   abandoned thyself and art gone out of thy faculties and thy personal
   nature. God installs himself in thy nature and powers when, self-bereft
   of all belongings, thou dost take to the desert, as it is written, A
   voice crying in the wilderness.' Let this eternal voice cry on in thee
   at its sweet will and do thou be a desert in resj^ect of self and
   creatures.

   Maybe thou wilt say : But, Sir, what must one do to become this desert,
   void of self and creatures ? Should one stay waiting for God all the
   time and do nothing oneself or should one do some- thing between
   whiles, such as praying or reading or some good occupation like going
   to church or studying the Bible ? Not, of course, taking things in from
   without, but everything from within, from one's God. Besides, is there
   not something we miss by neglecting these things ? '

   My answer is this : Outward works were instituted and appointed for the
   purpose of directing the outer man to God and training him to ghostly
   life and virtues lest haply he should stray out of himself into
   ineptitudes : to act as a curb upon his inclination to run aw''ay from
   self to things abroad ; so that when God shall choose to work in him he
   shall find him close at hand and not first have to fetch him back from
   things gross and alien. The greater is the ]3leasurc in external things
   the harder work it is to leave them ; the stronger the love the sharper
   the pain when it comes to parting.

   All pious practices - ])raying, reading, singing, watching, fasting,
   penance, or whatever discipline it be were contrived to catch and keep
   us from things alien and ungodly. Suppose one feels God's s]3irit is
   not working in one, but rather that one's inner man is God- forsaken,
   that is the proper moment for the outward man to exer- cise the
   practical virtues, and particularly such as arc most feasible and
   useful to him ; not for his o\vn selfish ends, but that, respect for
   truth preserving him from being led away by what is gross, he may stick
   straitly to God who will not need to seek him far afield, but will find
   liini there at hand when he chooses to return and carry on his own work
   in liis soul. But given that a man has genuine experience of the
   interior life, then let him boldly drop all outward disciplines, even
   those practices which thou art vowed to and from which neither p(3pe
   nor prelate can release thee. From vows made to God no man (Nan excuse
   thee : such vows are a bond between thyself and God. But supposing one
   has taken solemn vows of fasting, say, or prayer or pilgrimage, then on
   entering some order, one is released from them forthwith : in the
   order, obligation is to goodness as a whole, to God himself.

   Ami so I say here. Whatever one's vows to manifold things,

   initiation into the real interior life releases from them. While the
   interior expei'ieiicc lasts, maybe a week, a month, a year, no hours
   arc neglected by the monk or nun, for God who occupies them will also
   answer for them. On returning to himself the religious shall perform
   his vows for the time present, but the time elapsed and lost, as thou
   dost think, 'tis no business of thine to make good. God makes good any
   time he takes up. I'hink not to make it good by any act of creature,
   for the smallest act of God outweighs all the work of creatures put
   together. I am speak- ing here of clerks and those enlightened souls
   who are illumined by God and by the scriptures. But what about the poor
   profane who, ignorant of corporal discipline, has assumed some vow or
   other, praying or the like ? My view is this. Tf he finds it hampering
   and that he draws much nighcr God and much more easily without it, let
   him boldly give it up, for whatever brings nearest to God is the best.
   Paul implied this when he said : ' But when that which is perfect is
   come, that which is in part shall be done away.' Vows taken before
   priests, vows of marriage, for example, arc very different from these
   other obligations which amount to solemn promises of oneself to God.
   Vows taken with the laudable intention of binding oneself to God are
   for t he moment the best way. But supposing that we find a better way,
   a way we feel and know to be much better, then the first may be deemed
   null and void.

   THE ETERNAL BIRTH

   Et cum facUis esset Jesus annorum duodecim etc, {Luc, 2j,). We read in
   the gospel that when our Lord was twelve years old he went with Joseph
   and Mary to Jerusalem into the temple ; and when they went out, Jesus
   remained behind in the temple without their knowing it. And when they
   reached home and missed him, they sought him among aequaintan(es and
   among strangers, among their kindred, and among the multitude, and
   found him not ; they had lost him in the crowd. So there was nothing
   for it but to return whence they were come ; and when they got back to
   their starting-point, into the temple, there they found him.

   If thou wilt find this noble birth, verily thou must quit the multitude
   and return to the starting-point, into the ground out of which thou art
   come. The powers of the soul and their works, these are the multitude :
   memory, understanding and will, these all diversify thee, therefore
   thou must leave them all : sensible perception, imagination and
   everything wherein thou findcst

   thyself and hast thyself in view. Thereafter thou mayest find this
   birth, but, believe me, not otherwise. He has never been found among
   friends, nor among kindred nor acquaintances, there rather docs one
   lose him altogether.

   Now the question arises, whether this birth is to be found in anything
   which, albeit relating to God, is nevertheless taken in from without
   through the senses, in any presentment of God as good, wise, or
   compassionate, or whatever intellect can conceive of divinity : whether
   tJiis birth is to be found in any such-like things ? In truth, no !
   for, although good and godlike, they are neverthe- less introduced from
   without through the senses ; all must well up from within, out of God,
   if this birth is to shine with a really clear light, and thy own work
   must lie over, every faculty serving his ends not thine own. If this
   work is to be tlone, God alone must do it, and thou must undergo it.
   Where from tliy willing and knowing thou truly goest out, God with his
   knowing surely and willingly goes in and shines there clearly. Where
   (xod thus knows himself thy knowledge is of no avail and cannot stand.
   Do not fondly imagine that thy reason can grow to the knowledge of God
   ; that God shall shine in thee divinely no natural light can help to
   bring about ; it must be utterly extinguished and go out of itself
   altogether, then God can shine in with his light bringing back with him
   everything thou wentest out of and a thousandfold more, besides the new
   form containing it all.

   Of this we have an allegory in the gospel. When our Lord had talked so
   friendly with the Gentile woman at the well, she left her pitcher
   there, and running to the town announced to her people that the true
   Messiah was come. The people, not believing her report, went out with
   her to see him for themselves. Then said they unto her, Now we believe,
   not because of thy words, but because wc have seen him in person.'
   Verily, neither by any crcaturcly science nor by thine own wisdom canst
   thou be brought to know God divinely. To know God God-fashion, thy
   knowledge must change into downright unknowing, to a forgetting of
   thyself and every creature.

   Now haply thou wilt say : Prithee, Sir, what is the use of my intellect
   if it has to be inert and altogether idle ? Is it my best plan to raise
   my mind to the unknowing knowing which obviously cannot be anything ?
   For if I knew anything it would not be ignorance, nor should I be idle
   and destitute. Must I remain in total darkness ? '

   -- Aye, surely ! Thou canst do no better than take up thy abode in
   total darkness and ignorance.

   -- Alas, Sir ! must everything go then, and is there no return ? '

   -- No, truly ! By rights th^c is no return.

   -- But what is this darkness ? What does it mean, what is its name ? '

   -- It can only be called a potential receptivity, which, however, is
   not altogether wanting in nor indigent of (real) being : the merely
   potential conception wherein thou shalt be perfected. Hence there is no
   return from it. An thou rctiirnest it is not because of any truth ; it
   is cither the senses, the world or the devil. And pei\sisting in this
   turning back, thou dost inevitably lapse into sin and art liable to
   backslide so far as to have the eternal fall. Wherefore there is no
   turning back, only a pressing forward and following up this possibility
   to its fulfilment. It never rests until fulfilled with all being. As
   matter never rests until fulfilled with every possible form, so
   intellect never rests till it is filled to the full of its capacity.

   Concerning this a heathen master says : Nature has nothing swifter than
   the heavens which surpass all else in swiftness.' But surely the mind
   of man outstrips them. Given that it retains its vigour and stays
   undemeaned and undisinembered by what is base and gross, it can
   outstrip high heaven nor slacken till the summit, where it is fed and
   cherished by the Arch-Good, by God himself.

   How' profitable then to (.iisiie this possibility, for by keeping
   thyself empty and bare, merely tracking and following and giving up
   thyself to this darkness and ignorance without turning back, thou
   mayest well win that which is all things. And the more thou art barren
   of thyself and ignorant of things the nearer thou art thereto. Of this
   barrenness it is written in Ilosea : I will lead my friend into the
   desert and wall speak to her in her heart.' The genuine \Vord of
   eternily is vSpoken only in eternity, where man is a desert and alien
   to himself and multiplicity. For this desolate self-estrangement the
   prophet longed, saying : Who w^ill give me the wings of a dove that I
   may fly away and be at rest ! ' Where shall I find peace and rest ?
   Verily in rejection, in desola- tion and estrangement from all
   creatures. Wherefore David says : I had rather be an abject in the
   house of my God than have honour and riches in the tabernacles of
   sinners.'

   Now haply thou wilt say : Alas, Sir, after all, is it necessary to be
   barren and estranged from everything, outward and inward : the powers
   and their works, must all go ? It is a grievous matter for a man thus
   to be left by God without support ; for God to thus augment his misery,
   neither enlightening nor encouraging nor working in him, for that is
   what your teaching means. For a person in such downright nothingness
   would it not be better to be doing something to beguile the gloom and
   desolation ; to pray or read or go to church or else make shift by
   working at some useful occupation ? '

   No, be sure of this : absolute stillness, absolute idleness is best of
   all. Know that thou canst not without harm exchange this state for any
   other whatsoever. Fain wouldst thou partly fit thyself and let God
   partly fit thee, but that cannot be. Art never so quick to think of
   this fitness and desire it, God forestalls thee always. But granting,
   what is impossible, that it is shared : that the preparation for this
   working or infusion is jointly his and thine, know then, that God is
   bound to act, to pour himself out (into thee) as soon as ever he shall
   find thee ready. Think not it is with God as with a human carpenter,
   who works or works not as he chooses, who can do or leave undone at his
   good pleasure. It is not thus with God ; but finding thee ready he is
   obliged to act, to overflow into thee ; just as the sun must needs
   burst forth when the air is bright and clear, and is unable to contain
   itself. Forsooth, it were a very grave defect in God if, finding thee
   so empty and so bare, he wrought no excellent work in thee nor primed
   thee with glorious gifts.

   In the same sense philosophers declare that the instant the child-stuff
   is ready in the mother's womb, God pours into the body its living
   spirit, that is, the soul the form of the body. It is one flash, the
   being-ready and the pouring-in. Nature reaching her summit, God
   dispenses his grace : the instant the spirit is ready God enters
   without hesitation or delay. In the book of Mystery it is written that
   our Lord offers himself to men ; Behold I stand at the door and knock,
   waiting for someone to let me in, with him will I sup.' Thou needst not
   seek him here or there, he is no further off than at the door of thy
   heart ; there he stands lingering, awaiting whoever is ready to open
   and let him in. Thou needst not call to him afar, he waits much more
   impatiently than thou for thee to open to him. He longs for thee a
   thousandfold more urgently than thou for him : one point the opening
   and the entering.

   Thou wilt say, perhaps : How can that be ? I have no inkling of him.'
   -- Know, that to find him is not in thy power but in his. He discovers
   himself when he chooses and he hides himself too when he will. This is
   what Christ meant when he said to Nicodemus, The spirit breatheth where
   he will ; thou hearest his voice, but knowest not whence he corneth nor
   whither he goeth.' This is a contradiction : Thou hearest but knowest
   not.' By hearing we know. Christ meant that through hearing it is
   imbibed or absorbed ; as though to say : thou rcceivest it but
   unawares. For know, God cannot leave anything void and unfilled ; that
   aught should be empty or void is not to be endured by nature's God. An
   thou seemest, therefore, not to find him and to be wholly empty of him,
   yet that is not the case. For were there any

   in me, can I have any sign whereby to recognise that it has taken place

   Yes, surely ! There would be three signs. 1 will tell you one of them.
   I am often asked whether it is possible to reach the point of not being
   hindered by anything in time, cither by multiplicity or matter ? Indeed
   it is ! If this birth really happens no creature can hinder thee, all
   point thee to God and this birth. We find in lightning an analogy for
   this. Whatever it strikes, whether tree, beast or man, it turns towards
   itself with the shock. A man with his back to it instantly fiings round
   to face it ; all the thousand leaves of the tree turn over to front the
   stroke. So with all whom this birth befalls, they arc promptly turned
   towards this birth with everything present, be it never so earthly.
   Nay, even what was formerly a hindrance is now nothing but a help. Thy
   face is turned so full towards this birth, no matter what thou dost see
   and hear, thou rceeivest nothing save this birth in anything. All
   things are simply God to thee who seest only God in all things. Like
   one who looks long at the sun, he encounters the sun in whatever he
   afterwards looks at. If this is lacking, this looking for and seeing
   God in all and sundry, then thou lackest this birth.

   Thou mayest question : Ought anyone so placed to practise penance ?
   Does he lose anything by dropping penitential exercises ? '

   Penitential practices, among other things, were instituted for a
   special object. Fasting, watching, praying, kneeling, scourging,
   wearing of hair shirts, hard lying or whatever it may be, were all
   invented because body and flesh stand ever opposed to spirit. The body
   being far too strong for it, there is always battle joined between
   them, a never-ending conflict. Here the body is bold and strong for
   here it is at home ; the world helps it, the earth is its fatherland,
   it is helped by all its kindred : food, drink, ease -- all are opposed
   to spirit. The spirit is an alien here, in heaven are its kindred, its
   whole race ; there dwell its loved ones. To succour the spirit in its
   distress and to impede the flesh somewhat in this strife lest it
   conquer the spirit, we put upon it the bridle of penitential practices
   to curb it, so that the spirit can control it. This is done to bring it
   to subjection ; but to conquer and curb it

   a thousand times better, put thou upon it the bridle of love. With love
   thou overcomest it most surely, with love thou loadest it most heavily.
   God lies in wait for us therefore with nothing so much as with love.
   For love is like the fisherman's hook. To the fisher- man falls no fish
   that is not caught on his hook. Once it takes the hook the fish is
   forfeit to the fisherman ; in vain it twists hither and thither, the
   fisherman is certain of his catch. And so I say of love : he who is
   caught thereby has the strongest of all bonds and yet a pleasant
   burden. He who bears this sweet burden fares further, gel s nearer
   therewith than by using any harshness j)ossiblc to man. Moreover, he
   can cheerfully put up with whatever befalls, cheerfully suffer what God
   inflicts. Naught makes tlice so much God nor God so much thine own as
   this sweet bond. He who has found this way will seek no other. He who
   hangs on this hook is so fast caught that foot and hand, mouth, eyes
   and heart and all that is man's is bound to be God's.

   So then thou caiist not, better than by love, prevail over thy foe and
   stop him doing thee a mischief. Wherefore it is written : Love is
   strong as death and hard as hell.' Death separates soul from body, but
   love separates all things from the soul ; she will not tolerate at any
   cost what is not God nor God's. Who is caught in this net, who walks in
   this way, whatsoever he works is wrought by love, whose alone the work
   is : busy or idle it matters nothing. Such an one's most trivial action
   is more profitable, his meanest occupation is more fruitful to himself
   and other people and to God is better pleasing than the cumulative
   works of other men, who, though free from mortal sin, arc yet inferior
   to him in love. H(^ rests more usefully than others labour.

   Await thou therefore this liook, so thou be happily caught, and the
   more surely caught so much the more surely freed.

   That we may be tlius caught and freed, help us () thou who art love
   itself. Amen.

   DEUS CHARITAS EST

   Deus charitas est et qui manet in charitate in deo manet et deus in eo
   (J Joh, 4jq). God is love, and he who dwells in love dwells in

   God and God in him.' This is the epistle we read at Mass, and it is St
   John speaking.

   Take the opening words : GocL is love.' That is so, inasmuch as all
   that can love, all that does love, he compels by his love to love him.
   God is love, secondly, inasmuch as every God-created and loving thing
   compels him by its love to love it, willy-nilly.

   God is love, thirdly, inasmuch as his love drives all his lovers out of
   multiplicity. The love of God in multijDlicity pursues the love which
   is himself right out of multiplicity into his very unity. God is love,
   fourthly, who by his love provides all creatures with their life and
   being, preserving them in his love. The colour of the cloth is
   preserved in the cloth : even so creatures are preserved in existence
   by love, that is, God. Take the colour from cloth, its subsistence is
   gone : so do creatures all lose their subsistence if taken from love,
   to wit, God. God is love, and so lovely is he that lovers all love him,
   willy-nilly. No creature is so vile as to love what is bad. What we
   love must be good or must seem to be good. But creaturely good, all
   told, is rank evil as compared with God. St Augustine says, Love, that
   in meditating love thou mayst provide the wherewithal to satisfy thy
   soul.' God is love.

   My children, mark me, I pray you. Know ! God loves my soul so much that
   his very life and being depend upon his loving me, whether he would or
   no. To stop God loving me would be to rob him of his Godhood ; for God
   is love no less than he is truth ; as he is good, so is he love as
   well. It is the absolute truth, as God lives. There were certain
   theologians who maintained that the love which is within us is the Holy
   Ghost, but this is false. For the bodily food we take is changed into
   us, but the spiritual food we receive changes us into itself, hence
   love divine is not preserved in us, otherwise there would be two.
   Divine love preserves us in itself as one in the same.

   God is love, and he who dwells in love dwells in (iod and God in him.'
   There is a difference between ghostly things and bodily things. One
   ghostly thing dwells in another ; but nothing bodily dwells in another.
   There may be water in a tub, with the tub round it. But where the wood
   is the water is not. In this sense no material thing dwells in another.
   But spiritual things dwell in each other : each several angel with all
   his joy and happiness is in every other angel as well as in himself,
   and every angel with all his joy and happiness dwells in me, and God to
   boot with his entire beatitude, though I discern it not.

   If anyone should ask me what God is, I should answer : God is love, and
   so altogether lovely that creatures all with one accord essay to love
   his loveliness, whether they do so knowingly or unbeknownst, in joy or
   sorrow. Instance the lowest angel in his pure nature : the smallest
   spark or love-light that ever fell from him would light up the whole
   world with love and joy. See his innate perfection ! Moreover, as I
   have explained at various times, the angels are numerous beyond number.
   -- But to leave love and come to knowledge. If only we knew God it
   would be easy to forsake the world. All that God ever made or shall yet
   make.

   all this (I say), if God should give it to my soul without himself, he
   staying, so to speak, a hair's-breadth off, would not content my soul
   nor make me happy. I am happy when all things are in me and God, and
   where I am God is, and where God is I am.

   He who dwells in love dwells in God and God in him.' Suppose I am in
   God, then where he is I am ; and if God is in me, then, unless the
   scriptures lie, where I am God is. It is the absolute truth, as God is
   God.

   Faithful servant, I will set thee over all my goods,' ix. the manifold
   goodness of God in creatures will I set thee over. Secondly, I will set
   thee over all my goods ' means : at the source of creature happiness,
   in the pure unity of God himself wherein he has his own felicity. In
   other words : God being the good, in that sense will he set us above
   his manifold goodness. Thirdly, he will set us over all his goods,
   means : above all name- ables, all effables, all so-called good things
   and all intelligibles. Thus he sets us over all his goods.

   Father, I pray thee, make them one as I and thou arc one.' Where two
   grow one, one loses its nature. Ergo, for God and the soul to be one
   the soul has to lose her own liic and nature. They arc one as regards
   what is left. Hut for them to be one, one must lose its identity and
   the other must keep its identity. Then they arc the same. Now, the Holy
   Ghost says : I pray thee, let them be one as we are one. I pray thee,
   make them the same in us.'

   When I pray for aught my prayer goes for naught ; when I pray for
   naught I pray as I ought. When I am one with that wherein are all
   things, past, present and to come, all the same distance and all just
   the same, then they are all in God and all in me. There is no lliought
   of Henry or of Conrad. Praying for aught save God alone is idolatry and
   unrighteousness. They pray aright who pray in spirit and in truth. When
   praying for someone, for Henry or Conrad, I pray at my weakest. When
   praying for no one I pray at my strongest, and when I want nothing and
   make no request I am praying my best, for in God is no Henry nor no
   Conrad. To pray to God for aught save God is wrong and faithless, and,
   as it were, an imperfection.. For to set up something beside God is, as
   I lately said, but to make naught of God and God of naught. Whoso is
   far and foreign to himself as the chief angel of the Seraphim is far
   from him, that man owns that same angel just as God docs and is God,
   and that's the naked truth, as God is God. God is love, and he that is
   in love is in God and God in him.'

   May all of us attain this love whereof I speak. So help us our Lord
   Jesus Christ. Amen.

   JESUS WENT INTO THE TEMPLE

   Intravit Jesus in templum dei et ejiciehat omnes vendentes et emeyites
   etc. (Matt. 21 We read in the gospel that our Lord went into the temple
   and cast out all them that sold and bought and said to them that sold
   doves : Take these things hence ! ' It was his p\irpose to have the
   temple cleared, as though he said : This temple is by rights mine own
   and I want it to myself to be lord therein. This temple that God means
   to rule in is man's soul which he has made exactly like himself, as
   saith the Lord, We will make man in our image and likeness.' Which he
   did. So like himself God made man's soul that nothing else in earth or
   heaven resembles God so closely as the human soul. God wants this
   temple cleared of everything but himself. This is because this temple
   is so agreeable to him and he is so comfortable in this temple when he
   is there alone.

   Now consider who they were that sold and bought therein and who they
   are still. Mark me well : 1 name none but the virtuous. Yet, even so, I
   can point out who the merchants were, and still arc to this day, that
   thus buy and sell : those whom our Lord drove forth and cast out. He
   still does so to those that buy and sell in this temple : he would not
   leave a single one therein. Lo, they arc merchants all who, while
   avoiding niorhd sin and wishing to be virtuous, do good works to the
   glory of God, fasts, for example, vigils, prayers, etc., all of them
   excellent, but do them with a view to God's giving tliem somewhat,
   doing to thein somewhat, they wish for in return. All such arc
   merchants. This is plain to see, for they reckon on giving one thing
   for another and so to barter with our Lord, though they are mistook as
   to the bargain. For all they have and have the power to do, they have
   from God and do effect by means of God alone. God has no call to do to
   them or give to them anything unless he choose to. For what they arc
   they are from God and what they have they get from God, not from
   themselves. God is in no wise boimden to requite their acts or gifts,
   except he care to do so of his own free will, apart from what they do
   or give ; for they give not of their own nor do they act of their own
   selves, as God says, Without me ye can do nothing.' They be sorry fools
   who bargain with our Lord like this ; they know little or nothing of
   the truth. God cast them out of the temple and drove them forth. For
   light and darkness cannot dwell together. God is the truth, he is the
   light itself. When God enters the temple he drives out ignorance and
   darkness, revealing himself in the light of truth. Merchants go when
   the

   truth appears, for the truth needs no tnerchanting. God seeks not his
   own, he is perfectly free in all his acts, which he does in true love.
   So does the man who is at one with God : he is perfectly free in all
   his deeds ; he docs them out of love and without why, just to glorify
   God, not seeking his own therein, God energising in him.

   Moreover I maintain : as long as we work at all for gain, while we
   desire aught God may have given or may give, we rank with these
   merchants. Woiildst thou be free from any taint of trade ? then do what
   good thou canst and do it solely to God's glory, as exempt from it th 3
   ^self as though thou wert not. Ask nothing whatever in return. So done
   1 hy works are ghostly and godly ; the merchants are driven from the
   tem])le and God is there alone when one has no intention but God.
   Behold thy temple cleared of merchants. The man who is intent on God
   alone and on God's glory, verily he is free from any taint of commerce
   in his deeds, nor is he in any wise self-seeking.

   T have related further how Jesus said to them that sold doves :

   Take these things hen(*e ! ' These peoj3lc he did not drive forth nor
   rebuked them harshly : he said quite mildly : Take these things away !
   ' As though to say, it is not wrong albeit a hindrance to the pure and
   simple truth. These are virtuous folk, working for God impersonally
   though subject to personal limitations, to time and numljer, to before
   and after. Their activities keep them from the highest truth, from
   being absolutely free like our Lord Jesus Christ who is receiving
   himself afresh incessantly and a-temporally from his heavenly Father
   and in that same now is borne back again unceasingly with praise and
   thanksgiving into the Father, perfect, vicing with him in his majesty.
   Even so, to be receptive to the sovran truth, a man must be without
   before and after, without the hindrance of any acts or images that are
   wiihin his ken, but freely receiving the divine gift in the perennial
   now and bearing it back unhindered in th( liglit of the same with
   praise and thanksgiving in our Lord Jesus Christ. Then the doves arc
   gone, to wit, the obstacle of ownership in actions, good in themselves,
   wdicrcin one has any self-interest at all. Tak( these things hence ! '
   said our Lord, as though to say, they are blameless but tliey ar( in
   the way.

   When the tem])le is free from obstructions (possessions and strangers
   to wit), it looks right beautiful, shilling out bright and clear above
   cver^dJiing God has created and through everything (iod has created, so
   that none (*an compare with it but the uncreated God alone. In very
   truth, there is none like this tein]Jc but the uncreated God himself.
   Nothing below the angels is the least like this temple. The very
   highest angels arc the same as this

   temple of the human soul in many ways, but not entirely. This partial
   likeness with the soul they have in love and knowledge. But there is a
   limit set them which they cannot pass. The soul goes on beyond. Suppose
   the soul to be identical with the highest human being here in time,
   natheless that man has the potential freedom to soar to untold heights
   above the angels in the now of each, new without number, that is,
   without mode : above the angelic mode and every created intelligence.
   God who alone is uncreated is her sole peer in freedom, though not in
   uncrcated- ness, for the soul is created. Emerging into the unclouded
   light she in her naught leaps so far into his naught that she is
   helpless to regain the state of her created aught. God with his
   uncreatedness supports her nothing-at-all, preserving the soul in his
   all-in-all. The soul has dared to come to naught and, failing by
   herself to reach herself, she swoons away ere God comes to her rescue.
   It must needs be so. ^

   Jesus, as 1 said, went into the temple and east out them that bought
   and sold and he began to command the rest, Take these things hence ! '
   The words I have here read, ^ Jesus went in and began to say, " Take
   these things hence ! " ' Observe, there was no one there but Jesus when
   he began to speak in the tenij^lc of the soul. Be sure of this : while
   anyone else is speaking ii^ the temple {i,e, the soul) but Jesus, Jesus
   is silent, as thougli he were away, nor is he at home in the soul while
   she has strange guests to talk to. For Jesus to s])eak in the soul slic
   must be all alone, and she has to be quiet to hear what he says. VV(*11
   then, he comes in and starts speaking. What is it he says ? He says
   what he is. What is he, then ? lie is the Word of the Father. In this
   same Word the Father speaks himself, all his divine nature, all that
   God is, just as he knows it, and he knows it as it is, for he is
   perfect in knowledge and j)ower. It follows that he is ])crfcet in
   s])eeeh too. In pronouncing the Word he utters himself and all things
   in another Person to whom he gives the nature that he has himself, and
   speaks all intelligences in echo of the actual Word, accord- ing to the
   indwelling image ; like the sun-rays shining forth, so each
   (intelligence) is a word in itself, not the same in all respects as the
   Word, but : they have the power to receive by grace the same nature as
   the actual Word, and this Word as it is in itself the Father sj)oke
   entire by the Word and everything in that Word.

   If this is what the Father said, then what is Jesus saying in the soul
   ? As I have told : the Father speaks his Word ; he speaks in this Word
   and no otherwhere, and Jesus speaks in the soul. His manner of speaking
   is to reveal himself and what the Father said in him, so far as the
   soul is able to receive it. He reveals the

   Father in the soul in infinite power. Experiencing this power in the
   Son the soul waxes powerful in like emanation till she is the same in
   might and virtue and every perfection, so that neither joy nor sorrow
   nor aught that God has made in time avails to destroy that soul, she
   standing staunch as it were in this divine power against which all else
   is insignificant and futile.

   Secondly : Jesus reveals himself in the soul in infinite wisdom,
   himself to wit, the wisdom wherein the Father knows himself in full
   paternal power. The very Word, whieh is wisdom itself, and all that is
   therein, is, at the same time, one alone. When wisdom is in union with
   the soul, doubt, error and illusion arc entirely removed, she is set in
   the bright pure light of God himself, as saith the prophet, Lord in thy
   light shall we see light.' Then God is known by God in the soul ; she
   discerns with his wisdom both herself and all things. She knows not
   this same wisdom with herself, but with this widsom she discerns the
   Father fruitful in travail and his real being in impartible oneness
   void of all distinctions.

   Jesus manifests himself further in infinite suavity and fullness in all
   receptive hearts. When Jesus reveals himself in this plenitude of
   sweetness, uniting with the soul, then on this amiable tide the soul
   floats into herself and out of herself and beyond the things of grace,
   back in unmitigated power into her first source. Thus the outward man
   is obedient, even unto death, to the inner man now established in peace
   in the service of God for ever.

   May Jesus enter into us and clear out and east away all hindrances of
   soul and body to the end that we arc one with him here upon earth and
   there in heaven. So help us God. Amen.

   St John says : Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed
   upon us that we should be called and should be the sons of God.' lie
   says not only should be called ' but should be.' Now I maintain that we
   can no more be wise without wisdom than Son without the filial nature
   of God's Son : without having the very same nature as the Son of God
   himself. Wouldst thou be the Son of God ? Thou canst not, without
   having the same nature as the Son of God. But this is hidden from us
   hero, as it is written, Beloved, now we are God's sons (and it doth not
   yet appear what we shall he), but we know that he is our exemplar and
   we shall be like him.' That is, the same as he is : same life and
   enjoyment and understanding : exactly the same as he is, when wc see
   him as God. I say, God cannot make me the Son of God without I have the
   nature of God's Son, any more than God can make me wise without my
   havdng wisdom, "riiough we are God's sons, wc do not realize it yet :
   it doth not yet a]3pear ' to us, but this much wc do know, he says, we
   shall be like him.' Sundry things in our souls overlay this knowledge
   and conceal it from us.

   The soul has something in her, a spark of intellect, that never dies ;
   and in this spark, as at the apex of the mind, we place the paradigm of
   the soul ; and there is also in our souls knowledge of externals,
   sensible and rational ])erecption, present there as images and words
   which obscure it from us. ITow are we God's sons ? By having one nature
   with him. But any realization of this, of being God's sons, is
   subjective not objective knowledge. The inner consciousness strikes
   down to the very essence of the soul. Not that it is the soul itself,
   but it is rooted there and is in a measure the life of the soul, her
   intellectual life, the life, that is, wherein a man is born God's Son,
   born into tlu' eternal life, for this know- ledge is a- temporal, unex
   tended, without here and without now. In this life all things arc the
   same thing and all things common ; all things arc all in all and all
   atoned.

   I will give you an illustration. In the body the members are united so
   that eye belongs to foot and foot to eye. Could the foot speak, it
   would declare that the eye seems rather in the foot than in the head,
   and the eye would say the same the other way about. Accordingly, I trow
   that the grace which is in Maiy is really more an angel's and is more
   in him (yet being in Mary) than if it were in him or in the saints. For
   everything that Mary has belongs to every saint, so the grace in Mary
   is his own and he enjoys it more than if it really wore in him.

   But such a simile is too gross and carnal, depending as it does on
   bodily imagery. I will give you another, therefore, more subtle, less
   material. I assert that in heaven all is in all and all one

   and all ours. The grace our Lady has exists in me (when I am yonder),
   not as welling up in and flowing out of Mary, but as in me as my own
   and not of foreign origin. I contend that there what one has another
   has, not as from another nor as in another, but in its own self, so
   that the grace in one is simultaneously in another as his own grace.
   Thus spirit is in spirit. And that is why I say I cannot be the son of
   God unless I have the very nature the Son of God has there ; and that
   having this same nature makes us the same as he is, we seeing him as
   God. Hut it doth not yet appear what we shall be.' Meaning, I take it,
   that there is then no like nor different, but : wholly without
   distinction we are the same in essence and in substance and in nature
   as he is himself. This is not apparent now : it will be obvious when we
   see him as God.

   God makes us to know him, and his knowing is his being, and his making
   me know is the same as my knowing, so his knowing is mine : just as, in
   the master, what he teaehes is the same as, in the pupil, the thing
   that he is taught. And be(*ausc his knowing is mine, and his knowing is
   his substance and his nature and his essence, it follows that his
   substance and his nature and his essence are mine. And his substance,
   his nature and his essence being mine, therefore I am tjie Son of God.
   Behold, brethren, what manner of love God hath bestowed upon us that we
   should be called and should be the Son of God !

   Mark whereby we arc sons of God : by having the same nature as the Son
   of God.- -How can one be the Son of God, or know it, seeing that God is
   not like anybody? -- True, Isaias says, To whom will ye liken God or
   what likeness will ye compare unto him ?' Sitice it is God's nature to
   be not like anyone, we must needs not be so to be the same as he is.
   AVhen I contrive to see myself in naught and to scc naught in me ; when
   I succeed in rooting up and (tasting out everything in me, then 1 am
   free to pass into the naked being of the soul. Likes must be ousted ere
   I can be trans- planted into God and be the same as he is : same
   substance, same essence, same nature and the Son of God. Onc;c this
   happens, there is nothing hid in God that is not revealed, that is not
   mine. I am wise and mighty just as he is, and one and the same with
   him. Then Sion is a true beholder, true Israel, a seer : God, since
   nothing in the Godhead is (concealed from him. IMan is turned into God.
   Lilt that nothing may be concealed from me, everything revealed, there
   must appear in me no like, no image, for no image can show 'is God's
   nature nor his essence. While there abideth in thee any image or like
   thou art never the same as God. To be the same as ^od there must be
   nothing in thee, latent or defined, nothing Covered in thee that is not
   discovered and cast out.

   Mark wliat sin is. It is born of negation. Negation's brood must be
   exterminated in the soul ; while there is not in thee thou art not the
   Son of God. VVe weep and lament for want of some- thing. The minus
   quantity must go, be cancelled out, if man is to become tlie Son of God
   and \veep and wail no more. Man is not wood nor stone : impcrfeetioii
   and naught. We shall not be like him until this minus is made good and
   we are all in all as God is all in all.

   There are two births of man : one in the world, the other one out of
   the world and ghostly, in God. VVouldst know if thy child is born and
   if he is naked ? Whether, that is to say, thou hast been made God's Son
   ? If thy heart is heavy, except for sin, thy child is not born. In
   thine anguish thou art not yet mother ; thou art in labour and thine
   hour is nigh. Doubt not, if thou art travailing for thyself or for thy
   friend no birth has taken place though birth be close at hand, 'fhe
   birth is not over till thy heart is free from earc : then man has the
   essenee and nature and substance and wisdom and joy and all that God
   has. Then the very being of the Son of God is ours and in us and we
   attain to actual Deity.

   Christ says : If any will come after me, let him deny himself and take
   up his cross and follow me.' That is : east away care and let perpetual
   joy reign in your heart. Thus the (^hild is born. And when the child is
   born in me, the sight of friends, of father, dead there before my eyes
   will leave my heart untouched. Were my heart moved thereby the child
   would not be born in me, though peradventurc its nativity is nigh. I
   maintain that God and his angels lake such keen delight in every act a
   good man docs, that there is no joy like it. And accordingly, I say,
   the birth of this child in thee brings thee most keen delight in all
   good deeds done in this world, thy joy being so continuous as to be
   never- ending. Hence the words : ^'our joy no man taketh from you.'
   When I am transported into God, then God is mine and all he has.

   I am the Lord thy God,' he says. Then I have real delight which neither
   pain nor sorrow can take from me, for then I am installed in Ciod where
   sorrow^ has no place. We shall sec that in God is no anger nor sadness,
   but only love and joy. Though he seem sometimes to be wrathful with
   sinners it is not really wrath, it is his kindness, the effect of his
   great love : Whom he loveth he chasteneth,' for he is love, the Holy
   Ghost. God's anger springs from love ; he chides us with dispassion.
   When nothing is grievous or hard, when all is pure joy, then verily thy
   child is born. Strive that this child shall be not nascent merely but
   be born in thee, even as in God his Son is ever being born and is ever
   born. May this betide, So help us God. Amen.

   THE CASTLE OF THE SOUL

   Intravit Jesus in quoddam castellum et mulier qiuedam excepit ilium
   etc, {Luc, 10.^^). I quote first in Latin this text from the gospel.
   The translation reads : " Our I^ord Jesus Christ went up into a certain
   fastness and was receivTd by a oerlain virgin who was a wife.'

   Mark the term. Needs must it be a virgin by whom Jesus is received.
   Virgin is, in other words, a person void of alien images, free us he
   was when he existed not. It may be questioned ; Man born and launched
   on rational life, how can he be as free from images as he was when he
   was not, he knowing a variety of things, iinagt'S all of them : how can
   he possibly be void thereof ?

   I answer tliat, were I sulfieiently intelligent to have within me
   intellectually the sum of all the forms eoueeived by man aiid which
   subsist in C«od himself, I having no projxTty in them and no idea of
   ownership, positive or tiegative, past or to eome, but standing in the
   present fioro ])erfectly free in the will of (h.)d and doing it
   perpetually : then verily I were a virgin, unlumdleapped by forms, just
   as 1 was when J was not.

   Further, T hold that the fact of being virgin does not deprive a man at
   all of works that he has done : he is untrammelled, virgin- free of
   them in the sovran truths even as Jesus is absolutely free and virgin
   in himself. According to the masters, likeness, likeness only, is the
   cause of union, so man must be maiden, virgin, to rcceiv^e the virgin
   Jesus.

   Now lay this fact to heart : the ever virgin is never fruitful. To be
   fruitful the soul must be wife. Sj)ouse is the noblest title of the
   soul, nobler than virgin. For a man to rec(iv'e God within him is good
   and in receiving he is virgin. Ihit for God to be fruitful in him is
   still better : the fruits of his gift being gratitude therefor, and in
   this newborn thankfulness the spirit is the spouse bearing Jesus back
   into his Prather's heart.

   Many good gifts received in maidenhood are not brought forth in wifely
   fruitfulness, reborn in praise and thanks to God. Such gifts corrupt
   and come to naught, man being no better and no happier for them. In
   this case his virginity is useless because to his virginity he docs not
   add the perfe(*t fruitfulness of wife. That is the mischief. Hence my
   text, Jesus ascended to a certain fastness and was re(?eived by a
   certain maid who was a wife.' It must be so, as I have said.

   Wedded folks yield little more than one fruit yearly. But it is other
   wedded ones that I have now in mind : those whose hearts

   are wedded to praying, fasting, vigils or other outward discipline and
   mortilications of the i'esh. A predilection for this sort of thing,
   involving loss of freedom to wait instantly on God in the here and now,
   and follow him alone in the light wherein he would fain show thee what
   to do and what to leave undone, moment by moment, fresh and clearly, as
   though thou hadst naught else, nor would nor could not : any such
   proclivity or preoccupation which constantly deprives thee of this
   freedom I call here a year, and thy soul yields no fruit till she is
   done with this work of thy affection nor hast thou any trust in God or
   in thyself till thou hast finished with thy predilection ,* in other
   words, thou hast no peace. There is no fruit till thy own work is done.
   1 reckon this a year and one whose yield is poor ; the proceeds of
   affection not of freedom. And these folks I call wedded, yolked to
   their affections. Their crop is small and undersized at that, so I say,
   in God's sight.

   The virgin wife, free and unbound in her affections is ever as near God
   as to herself. She abounds in fruit and big withal, no more nor less
   than God is himself. This fruit, his birth, does that virgin bear who
   is a wife ; daily she yields her hundred and her thousandfold, nay,
   numberless her labours and her fruits in that most noble ground, the
   very ground, to speak more plainly, wherein the Father is begetting his
   eternal Word : there she is big with fruit. For Jesus, light and shine
   of the paternal heart (according to St Paul he is the light and
   splendour ' of the Father's heart), this Jesus is atoned with her and
   she with him, she is radiant with him and shining as the one alone, as
   one pure brilliant light in the paternal heart.

   Elsewhere I have declared, there is a power in the soul untouched by
   time and flesh, flowing from the Spirit, remaining in the Spirit,
   altogether spiritual. In this power is God, ever verdant, flowering in
   all the joy and glory of his actual self. Such dear delight, such
   incon- ceivable deep joy as none can fully tell, for in this power the
   eternal Father is procreating his eternal Son without a pause, the
   power being big with child, the Father's Son and its own self this
   self- same Son withal, in the unique power of the Father. Suppose a man
   absolute monarch, the sole ])osscssor of all earthly goods ; suppose he
   gave up all for God and was the poorest of the poor ; and that God laid
   on him to boot a burden big as ever he did lay on mortal man, all which
   he bare down to his death and then God granted him one fleeting vision
   of his being in this power : so vehement would be his joy that poverty
   and suffering would be wiped out. Aye, though God gave him never any
   taste of heaven but this, yet would he have the guerdon of his passion,
   for God himself is in this power as in the eternal now. If a man's
   spirit were always joined to God in this same power, he could not age

   For the now wherein God made the first man and the now wherein the last
   man disappears and the now I speak in, all arc the same in God where
   there is hut the now. Behold this man in ,thc same light as God having
   in hirii ho past nor yet to come, only one level of eternity. This man
   in truth has motion taken from him and all things stand intrinsic in
   liim. Nothing new conu'S to him from future things nor yet by accident
   for he dwells in the now, ever new and unceasingly renewed. So dominant
   is God in this same power.

   There is another power, immortal too : proceeding from the Spirit,
   remaining in the Spirit, altogether spiritual. In tliis power God is
   fiery, aglow with all his riches, with all his sweetness and with all
   his bliss. Aye, in tliis power is such poignant joy, such vehement,
   immoderate delight as none can tell nor yet in truth reveal. I say,
   moreover, if once a man in intellectual vision did really glimpse the
   bliss and joy therein, then all his sufferings, all God intends tliat
   he should suffer, would be a trille, a mere nolhing to him; nay, I say
   more, it would be pure joy and pleasure.

   Wouldst thou know for certain whether tliy sufferings are thine owp or
   God's? Tell by these tokens. Suffering for thyself, in whatever way,
   the suffering hurts thee and is hard to bear. But suffering for God and
   God alone thy suffering Inirts thee not nor docs it burden thee, for
   God bears the load. Believe me, if there were a man willing to suffer
   on account of God and of God alone, then though he fell a sudden prey
   to the collective sufferings of all the world it would not trouble liim
   nor bow him dowji, for God would be the bearer of his burden. If the
   burden they put upon my neck is forthwith shouldered by another I would
   as lief a hundred pounds as one, for not to me is it heavy and
   distressful. In brief : man's sufferings for God and God alone he makes
   both light and pleasant.

   I prefaced this sermon with the words : Jesus went up into a fastness
   and was received by a virgin who was wife.' Why ? She must needs be
   virgin and wife too. How Jesus was received I have explained. 1 have
   not told the meaning of this fastness and that I will now proceed to
   do.

   From time to time I tell of the one power in the soul which alone is
   free. Sometimes I have called it the tabernacle of the soul ; sometimes
   a spiritual light, anon I say it is a spark. But now I say : it is
   neither this nor that. Yet it is somewhat : somewhat more exalted over
   this and that than the heavens are above the earth. So now I name it in
   a nobler fashion than before as regard- ing rank and mode which it
   transcends. It is of all names free, of all forms void : exempt and
   free as God is in himself. It is one and simple as God is one and
   simple, and no man can in any wise

   behold it. This same power I am speaking of, herein God blooms and
   thrives in all his Godhood and the spirit in God ; in this very power
   the Father bears his only Son no less than in himself, for verily he
   liveth in this power, the spirit with the Father giving bii th therein
   to his very Son, itself this selfsame Son, for in this light wliich is
   the light of truth, it is the Son himself. Could ye see with iny heart
   yc would understand my words, but it is true, for truth itself has said
   it.

   So om' and simple is this fastness, frowning above all ways, of whieh 1
   mind me and am telling you, within tlic soul, that this high faculty I
   speak of is not Avorthy even of a fleeting glam^e therein; nor is tliat
   other power God glows and burns in, it durst not peer in either ; so
   one and indivisible this refuge is, so way- and powcr-transeeiiding
   tliis solitaiy one that never mode nor faculty has any insight there,
   not even (h)d himself. Never for an instant, as God lives, docs God see
   into this, nor did he ever look in his conditioned nature, in his
   gnis(. of Person. Note well, this ()7ie (done is lacking in every mode
   and quality. It follows that for God to see therein would cost him all
   Ins divine names and personal properties : all tliese he must forgo to
   look therein : only as one and indivisible, having no jot of mode or
   (piality, not Father nor Son nor Holy Ghost as sm^h, can he do this ;
   as some- what, yes, but not as tliis or that.

   As one and impartible behold him entering this one that here I call the
   fastness of the soul, but in no different guise can he get in : thus
   only does he enter and subsist in it. In part the soul is the same as
   God but not altogether. -- This that I tell you is true : truth is my
   witness and my soul the pledge. May we be as this fastness whereinto on
   ascending Jesus is received to abide eternally as I have said. So help
   us God. Amen.

   IX

   THE ETERNAL BIRTHS

   To return to the subject of the eternal birth. There is the ques- tion
   whether the soul brings forth the eternal Word in images or imagcless ?
   Remember this. When tlic soul resigns herself to God and is atoned with
   him and God undertakes her work, she is receptive merely and leaves God
   to act. Here the soul is pregnant without form or image, for anything
   conceived in form or image trenches upon time and place and is akin to
   creatures ; whence it follows that the more the work is of the soul the
   less it is of God.

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS 8d

   The soul conceives more truly without images than in them, for this
   birth is more by way of Godhood than of selfhood. But we may still
   enquire, in which image does the soul best succeed in giving birth to
   the eternal Word ? There are three kinds of images. The llrst the soul
   takes in from without through the senses. The second the soul conjures
   up from within by thinking on the childhood of our Lord or on his
   martyrdom ; but all images so gotten arc called divine births in the
   soul. The third kind of images is given to tlie soul by God direct. It
   is in these last that the soul conceives the best. According to another
   gloss : this happens when the mind engenders, feels and knows the
   eternal Word in its proper image as gotten by the Father in himself,
   supposing the soul able to attain thereto ; or, intellect failing her
   for this, when, faring forth in biith and love, he reaches out to this
   same image : for in this final image the eternal Word is born most
   perfectly of all.

   Another (juestion is, whether the birth of the eternal Word is fleeting
   or essential ? Now you must understand that it is this birth which
   unifies tlie soul, and in this respect it is intrinsic and passes not
   away unless a man should fall into mortal sin. But as happening in the
   sensible pen^eptions and in the discursive mind this birth is fugitive.

   Further, it is asked, in what particular place does the soul bring
   forth or seek the eternal Word ? Mark. It is in the Father as the
   intellectual image of his divine essence and is the reflection of his
   divine nature, so that it embodies both his essence and his nature. It
   is with the Father as the filial Person. It is in the Holy Ghost as the
   exuberance of their eternal satisfaction. It is in the soul as the
   likeness of God's equal forms (or Persons). It is in all creatures as
   the preserver of their being. It is here the soul must seek the eternal
   Word, here in these places, and Christ says : Seek and ye shall find.'
   May we so seek as to find eternally. So help us almighty God. I will
   say no more at this collation. Pray God to fit me for this blessed
   moment. Amen.

   St Dionysius says that beauty is good order with pre-eminent lucidity.
   Thus God is an arrangement of three Persons. And the soul's lower
   powers should be ordered to her higher and her higher ones to God ; her
   outward senses to her inward and her inward ones to reason ; thought to
   intuition and intuition to the will and all to unity, so that the soul
   may be alone with nothing flowing into her but sheer divinity, flowing
   here into itself. As St Dionysius says, By purity she has discovered
   her capacity and only her superior powers are in operation.

   It has been said by one philosopher that as soon as the chief power
   takes cominand the others all run into it, leaving their own work. Then
   the soul is in order and in her pure nature, in her supernal
   light-nature wherein all things are potential. A heathen doctor says,
   If the soul knew herself she would know all things. Deity flowed into
   the Father and into the Son and into the Holy Ghost: in eternity into
   itself and in time into creatures, to each as much as it can hold : to
   the stone its being, to the tree its growth, to beasts sensation, to
   the angels reason and to mankind all these four natures. When God was
   made man he took upon himself by grace, in time, the nature of all
   things, which in eternity was his by nature. As St Paul says, To me
   C'hrist is all things.' Here it was a matter of the light and
   reflection of his own nature. God's being is fontal : flowing and
   fixed, final as well as the first. From being power flows out into
   work. In this sense the three Persons are the storehouse of divinity
   and the three Persons are poured forth into the essence of the soul as
   grace, God's being in the essence of the soul is the imitation of the
   Persons and one being permeates the other. Her chief power flows from
   the essence of the soul just as the three Persons issue from the
   Godhead. And when God pours his grace into the soul it is into her
   essence that he pours it. For into the soul's essence no speck can ever
   fall, do her powers what they may. The chief power of the soul draws
   its virtue from the grace existing in the essence of the soul and this
   highest power goes out into the lower ones, into their essence. The
   crescent soul, the spirit receptive of God's nature, is the imitation
   of Christ's Person and man's nature. The soul when she reaches divine
   nature is deprived of all deficiency and imperfection ; she suffers
   death in divine nature, getting God's nature in herself as the Father
   does in him. She takes it not from her own nature, she receives it from
   God's nature into her nature ; she receives perfection and power
   according to the words of St Paul, I can do all things in him that
   strengtheneth me.' The wisdom thence arising in her mind begins in
   under- standing and is perfected in will and it has neither heart nor
   thought. St Dionysius says. As the soul takes the outgoing tide

   to journey in eternity and time and in her own intelligence, so on the
   ebb does she return ; as God the soul Hows back again, without
   exertion. God returns to himself as little mindful of his own as though
   they wore not. And the soul shall do the same. She shall grasp with her
   manhood the Person of the Son, and with the Person of the Son she shall
   apprehend the Father and the Holy Ghost in both, and them both in the
   Holy (ihost ; and with the Person of tlie Father she shall apprehend
   his simple essence, and with the essence the abyss, and shall sink into
   the void without matter and without form. Matter and form, being and
   knowledge, she loses ill this unity, for she herself has come to
   naught. God does all her work, he preserves her in his being and leads
   her in his power into his very (Godhead where she Hows with deity
   itself into all God Hows into. She is all things' place and has herself
   no place. This is the most eternal wisdom, which has neither heart nor
   thought. So nigh soul Ho\vs to God that many are deceived ; but wdiat
   she is she is by grace, and where she is she is by another's power. Yet
   she approaches near enough to (xod to be, in the power of the Father,
   invested with divinity by grace the same as the Father is by nature. St
   Paul says : In the same image we shall go from one glory to another,'
   meaning, we shall receive divinity in its perfection and all that is
   consequent thereon. Therein she shall conceive divinity as it conceives
   itself and her will and God's will shall be one : whatever God may be
   wc shall be with God. No one can attain it in this body, but when (Jod
   gives the soul his final gift, the vision of his Godhead, the soul is
   raised up in the Trinity. May wc attain to this, So help us God. Amen.

   Taking the opening words : The hour eometh and now is.' He who would
   worship the Father must betake himself into eternity in his desires and
   hopes. There is one, the loftiest, part of the soul which stands above
   time and knows nothing of time or of body. The happenings of a thousand

   backslide from truth T would fain cling to truth and let God go. Hut

   He says, they worship the Father.' Alas, how many worship crealurcs and

   dost pray to God for creatures thou prayest for thine own undoing, for
   no sooner is creature creature than hey for trouble and bitterness,
   Avrong and distress. They get tlieir deserts, do these lolk, with their
   wrongs and their bitterness. For why ? They prayed for it.

   I have sonudimes said, whoso gO('s seching God and seekiiig aught with

   not lind God alone ; all God affords he finds as well as God. Art tliou
   looking for God, sc'eking God with a view to thy jiersoual good, thy
   personal prolit ? Then in truth thou art not sething God. ' True
   Avorshippers Avorship the Father,' he saA^s, and he says right well. If
   a A irtuous man is asked, Why dost thou seek (xod V ' he ansAvers :
   Because he is God.'- AVhy dost thou s(ek truth? ' - ^ Beeause it is
   truth.' -- Why dost thou seek right ? ' Jh'cause it is right,' and

   such all is aa'cII. Things here in tinui have each tlieir cause. Ask a
   man why he eats ? For strength,' he says. Why he sleeps ?

   For tile very same reason.' And so Avith everything in time. But ask a
   good man, " hy dost thou lo\^e God ? ' -He says :

   I knoAv not ; for God's sake.' Why dost thou love the truth V -- For

   Philosophers say the soul is double-faeed, her upper face gazes at God
   all the time and her lower fac'e looks somewhat down, informing the
   senses ; and the upper face, whieli is the summit of the soul, is in
   eternity and has nothing to do with time : it kno\vs nothing of time or
   of body. Kls(wherc T have (xplaiiu'd how in this li(S hid llu* fount as
   it were of all good, as a shining light that is always shining, a
   burning brand that is always hairning, which brand is none other than
   the Jloiy Ghost.

   Philosophers say that out of the summit of the soul there tlow twin
   powers. The one is will, the oilier intiHeet, and her ])owers'
   jierfeetion lies in the sovran })ower of intellect. TJiis ne\'cr rests.

   kindness ; it wants liini as the miirrow dripping fatness ; it w^ants
   him as the root, the main of goodness : thus he is simply Father.

   Our Lord says : No man know^eih the Father but the Son, nor tlic Son

   on the son, and thendbre none can say : 1 am the Son ' unless he have
   the Fatlier and he is in truth Son whose every work is wrought for love
   therein. Secondly, that which most makes man Son is equaliility. lleing

   CONTEMPLATION, HINTS AND PROMISES'

   When a man delights to read or h(ar tell about, Ciod, that comes of
   divine grace and is lordly entertainment for the soul. To entertain God
   in one's thoughts is sweet(r than Jioney, but to be sensible of God is
   teeming consolation to the nol)le soul, and union with God in love is
   everlasting joy which we relish here as we arc fitted for it.

   Dionysius says, The soul shall follow God into the desert of his
   Godhead, so far as here the body follows Christ in outward willing
   poverty.' -- But that soul is idle.' To which St Bernard answers :
   Waiting upon God is not idleness but work which beats all other work to
   one unskilled in it.' In order to find God, we must seek him in his
   Godhead. Christ says, ' If father and mother or anything else be a
   hindrance, quit them for good and serve God unhindered.' The
   philosopher says, The soul which is mov^ed by the power of the Prime
   Cause need seek no counsel from any human wisdom ; he is obeying what
   transcends wisdom, for lie is niovx*d by the latent primitive truth.'

   thoughts are useless. And to cov'-et them is useless too, unless wc
   diligently seek how we may acquire them.

   We would fain be humble ; but not despised. To be despised and rejected
   is the heritage of virtue. Wc would be poor too, but without
   privatioti. And doubtless we are patient, except with hardslups and
   with disagreeables. And so with all the virtues.

   The willing poor, imsolaccd by corru[)tiblcs, descend into the valley
   of humility. They arc pursued by insult and adversity, the best school
   of self-knoAvledge. And self-knowledge gets God- kn owl edge.

   My children, ye who suffer insult, if the world reject you, do ye
   therewith likewise assail yourselves, helping to reject yourselves. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ said, The servant is not greater than his lord. If
   the world hate you, know ye it hated me before it hated you.'

   We ought to recompense our Lord for all that he has done. There are
   plenty to follow our Lord half-way, but not the other half. They will
   give up possessions, friends and honours, but it touches them too
   closely to disown themselves.

   Some there be, neither wanting nor looking for honours, yet, chancing
   to come their way, honours affect them.

   St Lernard says : When a soul comes to wanting what few desire : to be
   nam&lt;*lcss, outcast and disgraced, and makes all welcome equally,
   then she attains to peace and the true freedom needed for real vision
   in the mirror of divinity.'

   Perfect rest is absolute freedom from motion. Our Lord says, Continue
   in my word and the trutli shall make you free.* Freedom of soul
   consists in this : in finding in hcrs(*lf no sin ; in tolerating in
   herself no spiritual imperfection. She is more free lacking all hold on
   what possesses name and it on her. Freest of all when she transcends
   her selfhood and Hows with all she is into the bottoml(*ss abyss of her
   primordial mould, into God liimsclf.

   Our liord Jesus Christ exhorts us to renounce all things that we may be
   less hindered. St Bernard declares : All the time thou oceupiest not
   with God is accounted unto thee for lost.' And again, The most subtle
   temptalion that can beset us is to occupy ourselves too much in outward
   works.' Further he says, The best preparation 1 know for heaven is
   having no home among externals.'

   Our least interior act is higher and nobler than our grandest outward
   one, and yet our loftiest interior act halts in God's unveiled presence
   in the soul.

   The very best work that wc can do is to prepare for union with the
   present God and wait for this with fixed intention.

   St Paul says, Optimum esse unire deo : Best of all is to be one

   with God. In this union the soul is dead, not only to all outward but
   also to all inward ghostly acts. God operates unhindered, and the soul
   bears his godly operation to which she yields obediently enough for God
   to bring to birth his only Son in her no less than in himself. This is
   the atonement wherein, in the twinkling of an eye, the soul is made
   more one with God than by her doing any act, bodily or ghostly. The
   oftencr this birth happens in the soul the closer grows her union with
   God.

   God is born in the empty soul by discovering himself to her in a new
   guise without guise, without light in divine light.

   St Augustine says, The soul being aflame with divine love, God is born
   in the soul, the Holy Ghost being the enkindler of love.'

   God has vouchsafed divine light to the soul that he may blithely work
   in his own image.

   Now no creature can do what is not in its power. Hence the soul cannot
   act above herself, not even with the bridal gift that God has given her
   in tlie shape of her most exalted faculty. This light, albeit divine,
   is still created. The creator is one and the light another. So God
   comes to the soul in love, purposing that love shall raise her to a
   higher power, to a function superior to her own. But love fails to tell
   unless she meets or makes her match. As far as God finds his likeness
   in the soul, so far is God in operation. If her love is boundless, God
   acts as boundless love.

   A man might live a thousand years and go on growing all the time in
   love, just as fire will burn so long as there is wood. The bigger the
   fire and the stronger the wind, the more fiercely it ^ burns. Now put
   love for the fire and the Holy Ghost for the I wind : the greater the
   love and the stronger the inspiration of the I Holy Ghost in grace, the
   quicker the work of perfection is achieved. Yet not suddenly, but by
   the gradual growth of the soul. It would not be well for the whole man
   to be consumed at once.

   The soul becomes so one with God that grace confines her ; she is not
   satisfied with grace, for grace is creaturcly. The soul is so curiously
   glamoured, she does not realise that she exists : she fancies herself
   God, so utterly she has escaped from self. But be she never so far gone
   from self, she goes on being creature. Pouring a drop of water into a
   vat of wine does not destroy it. Seeing herself the soul sees spirit ;
   seeing the angels she again sees spirit ; but God is such pure spirit
   that soul and angel are nigh bodily compared with him. A portrait of
   the highest seraph limned in black would be a better likeness far than
   God portrayed as highest seraph : that were a pre-eminent unlikeness.

   Now in the contemplative state we are consumed by fiery love in the
   Holy Ghost. Sooner than knowingly commit a sin, venial or mortal, we
   shall prefer to suffer every imaginable martyrdom.

   If by one venial sin we were enabled to release from hell souls without
   number, we would not ransom them. Such love to God must a man have to
   be familiar with him in contemplation. Moreover, he must have a mind at
   ease ; and in preparing for it, an undisturbed retired spot is
   necessary. The body should be rested from bodily labour, not only of
   the hands but of the tongue as well and all five senses. The soul keeps
   clear best in the quiet, but in jaded body is often overpowered by
   inertia. Then by strenuous effort we travail in divine love for
   intellectual vision till, clearing a way through recollected senses, we
   rise past our own mind to the wonderful wisdom of God, though this is
   quite beyond the grasp of any creature. We rise to divine heights.
   David says : Accedat homo ad cor altum et exaltahitur deus, that is,
   Man rising to the summit of his mind is exalted God. From this divine
   eminence we see the lowness and insignificance of creatures. We feel an
   inkling of the perfection and stability of eternity, for there is
   neither time nor space, neither before nor after, but evcrytliihg
   present in one new, fresh-springing noiv where millenniums last no
   longer than the twinkling of an eye. And we win participation in the
   manifold delights of tlie heavenly host. So great the joy of Mary Queen
   in heaven, that having but a thousandth part of it, each member of the
   heavenly company would taste far more than ever they have earned. There
   every spirit rejoices in the joy of every other, relishing it each in
   his degree. Every celestial habitant is, knows and loves in God, in his
   own self and in every other spirit whether soul or angel. And the
   distinctive conscious-, ness of one Gpd in three Persons and the Three
   one God gives such ineffable, amazing satisfaction that all their
   passionate longing is fulfilled. And just what they are full of they
   crave unceasingly, and what they crave is all their own in new,
   fresh-springing joyful ecstasy, theirs to enjoy in all security from
   everlasting unto everlasting.

   Thereafter we press on into the truth, into the simplicity God is
   himself, not seeking what is his. So we fall into peculiar wonder. In
   this wonder let us remain, for human wit is powerless to fathom it.
   Plumbing the deeps of divine wonder but stirs facile doubt.

   in and through the Son.' Those that live not through the Son, verily
   they err.

   If a mighty king had a beautiful daughter and gave her to a poor man's
   son, every member of his family would rise in rank and become ennobled.
   Thus one learned doctor says : By God becoming man the whole human race
   has been ennobled and exalted ; wherefore it behoves us to rejoice
   greatly that Christ our brother has with peculiar power ascended up
   above the choir of angels and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.'
   This is well said, though I set but little store by it. What profit to
   me that my brother is rich if I am poor, or wise and I a fool ?

   I say something more and more significant : God not only became man, he
   assumed human nature. Doctors agree that all men are of equal rank by
   nature. But I make bold to say that every good thing possessed by the
   saints and by Mary, God's mother, and Christ in his human nature, is
   also mine in this same nature. Haply thou wilt ask me : If already I
   possess in this nature all that Christ does in his humanity, how come
   we to set Christ so high and honour him as our Lord and God ? ' --
   Because he was a messenger from God to us, bringing us our happiness.
   The happiness he brought us was our own. When the Father begets his Son
   in the innermost ground, what moves there has this nature. This same
   nature is one and indivisible. Anything distinct in it or connected
   with it is not this one.

   Another thing I say, still harder. To subsist immediately in this pure
   nature a man must be so wholly dead to person that he wills as well to
   one across the seas whom his eyes have never seen as to his own present
   and familiar friend. While thou still wishest better to thine own
   person than to that man whom thou hast never seen thou art beside the
   mark, nor hast thou even for an instant seen into this simple ground.
   Haply in some far-fetched symbol thou hast beheld the truth as in an
   image, but it was not the best. -- Secondly, thou must be pure in heart
   ; and only that heart is pure which has exterminated creaturehood. And
   thirdly, thou must be free from not.

   It is a question, what burns in hell ? Doctors reply with one accord :
   self-will.' But I maintain : not burns in hell. A simile 1 Suppose I
   take a burning coal and put it on my hand ; then if I say the coal is
   burning me, I do it great injustice. To define precisely what it is
   that bums me : not docs ; because the coal has in it something my hand
   has not. Observe, it is this very not that bums me. Did my hand contain
   what the coal is and can afford, it would possess the fire-nature
   altogether. In which case all the fire that ever burned might be taken
   and heaped upon my hand without its burning me. Likewise, I aver that

   because God and those who are in sight of God, have in them something
   pertaining to real happiness which those who are apart from God have
   not, therefore this not alone torments the souls in hell more than the
   personal will or any fire soever. In sooth I hold : as far as not
   inheres in thee, so far thou art imperfect. To be perfect, then, thou
   must be free from not.

   Further, my text says : God sent his only-begotten Son into the world,'
   by which ye are to understand not the external world : it must be taken
   of the inner world. As surely as the Father by his simple nature begets
   the Son innately, so surely he begets him in the innermost recesses of
   the mind, which is the inner world. Here God's ground is my ground and
   my ground God's ground. Here I live in my own as God lives in his own.
   To one who even for an instant has seen into this ground, a thousand
   ducats of red beaten gold are worth no more than a false farthing. Out
   of this innermost ground thy works should be wrought without why.
   Indeed, I hold that as long as thou doest thy works because of the
   kingdom of heaven, or God, or thine own eternal happiness, from without
   (that is to say), all is not well with thee. It may be tolerable but it
   is not the best. He who fondly imagines to get more of God in thoughts,
   prayers, pious offices and so forth, than by the fireside or in the
   stall : in sooth he does but take God, as it were, and swaddle his head
   in a cloak and hide him under the table. For he who seeks God under
   settled forms lays hold of the form while missing the God concealed in
   it. But he who seeks God in no speeial guise lays hold of him as he is
   in himself, and such an one lives with the Son ' and is the life
   itself. We might question life for a thousand years : Why dost thou
   live ! * It would only say, if it replied at all, I live because I
   live.' For life lives in a ground of its own, wells up out of its own.
   It lives without a cause for it lives itself. And if anyone asked a
   proper man, one who works his own ground, Why dost thou work ? ' he too
   would say, if he told the truth : I work because I work.'

   Where creature stops, there God begins. All God wants of thee is for
   thee to go out of thyself in respect of thy creatureliness and let God
   be God in thee. The smallest of creaturely images that ever takes shape
   in thee is as big as God. -- How so ? '

   -- It shuts out the whole of God. As soon as this image appears God
   disappears with all his Godhood. As this image fades out God comes in.
   [No temporal image is so godly but thrice harms the soul. First, it
   vexes spirituality ; next, it tarnishes her purity ; and thirdly, it
   disturbs detachment.

   -- What does God do to my mind ? '

   -- Transcend thyself and repress creatures : God does that to thy
   mind.]

   God longs as urgently for thee to go out of thyself in respect of thy
   creaturely nature as though his whole felicity depended on it. Why,
   man, what is the harm of letting God be God in thee ? Go clean out of
   thyself for God's sake, and God will go clean out of his for thy sake.
   Both being gone out, what remains is simply the one. In this one the
   Father gives birth to his Son, in his inner- most source. Thence
   blossoms forth the Holy Ghost and thence originates in God the will
   belonging to the soul. The while this will remains unmoved by creatures
   and by creaturehood, the will is free. Christ says : None goes to
   heaven but he who came from heaven.' Things are all made from nothing ;
   hence their true source is nothing. This noble Avill, as far as it
   inclines to creatures, with them elapses into nothing.

   The question is, Docs the will lapse so far that it is never able to
   return ? Doctors reply with one accord that it docs not return so far
   as it has lapsed with time. But I maintain that if this will turns
   back, even for an instant, from its oAvri self and things created and
   rallies to its source, there in its own free origin the will is free
   and in this instant time lost is all recovered.

   People often say to me : Pray for me.' And I think to my- self : Why
   ever do ye go out ? Why not stop at home and mine your own treasure ?
   For indeed the whole truth is native in you.

   May we be apt to stay thus in ourselves and to possess the entire truth
   immediately, impartibly, in real happiness. So help us God ! Amen.

   LIKE A VASE OF GOLD

   Quasi vas auri soliduni ornatuin omni lapide pretioso {EccL SO^q), My
   quotation will apply to St Augustine or to any virtuous soul, such
   being likened to a golden vessel, massive and lirm, adorned with every
   precious stone.' Because of the perfection of the saints we have no
   likeness to express them, and we therefore symbolise them by the trees,
   the sun, or moon. So here St Augustine is compared with a chalice of
   gold, solid and firm, all set with precious stones. Indeed I he same
   thing may be said of any saintly virtuous soul who, leaving all things
   here, enjoys them yonder where they are eternal. Whoso renounces things
   in their contingent sense possesses them as absolute and eternal.

   Every cup has two things : it receives and holds. The spiritual vessel
   differs from the physical. The wine is in the cup, not the cup in the
   wine, though the wine is not in the cup as it is in the body ; if it
   were in the cup as it is in the body we should not be able to drink it.
   It is different with the spiritual vessel. Every-

   thing received in this is in the eup and the cup in it and is the cup
   itself. All this ghostly cup receives is its own nature. It is God's
   nature to give himself to every virtuous soul, and it is the soul's
   nature to receive God, and this we say referring to the soul in her
   loftiest capacity. There the soul bears the image of God and is
   godlike. No image can be without likeness, but likeness can be without
   image. Two eggs may be both alike white, but one is not the image of
   the other : for one to be the image of the other it must proceed out of
   its nature and be born of it and be like it.

   An image has two properties. First, it rccciv es its being from the
   thing whose image it is, immediately and above will, for it is a
   natural product, sprouting out of its nature as a branch does out of a
   tree. Any face thrown on a mirror is, willy-nilly, imaged therein. But
   its nature does not appear in its looking-glass image : only the mouth,
   nose and eyes, just the features, are seen in the mirror. God reserves
   it to himself to display in his reflec- tions, at once his nature, all
   In^ is and all he can, and tliis above his will. His image is prior to
   his will, will following the image, for out of his nature there leaps
   first his image, focussing into itself the whole promise of his nature
   and liis essence, all his nature pouring out into his image the wliih'
   it abides intact within itself. Now the masters locate tliis iiiiage
   not in flir Holy Ghost but in the middle Person, for the Son, being the
   earliest issue of his nature, is therefore called his Father's express
   image, and not the Holy Ghost ; he is simply the flowering of the
   Father and the Son, and has one nature with them both. Will is not a
   mean between the nature and the image, nor, for that matter, can
   knowledge or per- ception, nay, nor wisdom, come betw'^een, for this
   image of God is the immediate product of his fecund nature. If there is
   means of wisdom here it is the image itself. Thus the Son in the
   Godhead is called the Wisdom of the Father.

   Know, this impartible image of God which is stamped in the soul is
   sealed direct in her innermost nature ; this most funda- mental, most
   noble part of her nature, is really what takes this soul-pattern, and
   that not by means cither of will or of wisdom. As I remarked just now,
   if wisdom comes in here at all it is (as) the pattern itself. God
   exists in this image without any means and the image subsists without
   means in God. But (iod is much more noble in the image than the image
   is in God. The image receives God not as being the creator ; it
   conceives him in the guise of understanding, the summit of her nature
   actually taking on his form. This is the innate divine image which God
   has stamped in every soul by nature. I durst not give more to this
   image ; to give it more would make it God himself, which it is not, or
   God would not be God.

   The second characteristic of an image we note in its likeness to its
   object. And here observe especially two things. First : an image is not
   itself, neither is it its own. So an image received into the eye is not
   the eye itself nor has it any real existence in the eye but is merely
   suspended from and tethered to the thing it is the image of, whereto it
   entirely belongs and wherefrom it gets its being and is being that same
   being. Note well my definition of an image. There are four points to
   bear in mind, and haply others will occur to you. An image is not
   itself, neither is it its own : it is solely that thing's whose
   reflection it is, and it is due to this alone that it exists at all.
   Things apart from the thing whose image it is, it is not and does not
   belong to. The image takes its being direct from the thing whose image
   it is, having one nature therewith and being the very same being. This
   is not a subject for discussion in the schools, though one may well
   propound it from the professorial chair.

   Ye are always asking how ye ought to live. Lay then to heart this
   answer: Just as the image is here said to do, even so it behoves thee
   to live. Be his and belonging to him, not thine own and belonging to
   thyself nor withal to anyone. Whoever has a well-beloved friend holds
   his belongings dear and anything against his friend he will object to.
   Take, for example, the dog, an irrational beast. So faithful is he to
   his master that he resents the things his master hates, while to his
   master's friends he is most friendly. No count takes he of poverty or
   wealth ; were some blind beggar his master's bosom friend, he would be
   more affectionate to him than to the king or emperor who was his
   master's enemy. I trow if it were possible the dog should be half
   faithless to his master, its other half were bound to hate itself. But
   then some folks complain of having no interior life, no devotion, no
   sweetness nor any suchlike godly consolation. Marry, these folk are all
   unrighteous still, and though they suffer it is not the best. Verily I
   say, as long as any image forms in thee which is not the eternal Word
   nor any shadowing forth of the eternal Word, be it never so good, in
   sooth it is wrong. That man alone is righteous who, having naughted all
   created things, stands facing straight along the unswerving line into
   the eternal Word, where, in the right, he is idealised and transformed.
   That man is gotten where the Son is gotten and is the Son himself. .

   According to the scriptures, No man knoweth the Father but the Son,'
   and hence, if ye desire to know God, ye have to be not merely like the
   Son, ye have to be the very Son himself. Some people think to see God
   with their eyes as they would see a cow, and they expect to love him as
   they would love a cow. This thou lovest for its milk and for its cheese
   : for its profit to thyself.

   Even so do they who love God with an eye to outward riches or interior
   consolation, not rightly loving God but their own i)ersonal advantage.
   I trow that any object thou shalt set before thy mind, except God in
   himself, how good soever it may be, is nothing but a barrier to the
   absolute truth. As I said just now that St Augustine is compared to a
   golden cup, closed on the underside and open to the sky, even so it
   behoves thee to be : if thou wouldst stand with St Augustine and in the
   communion of saints, then close thy heart to everything created and be
   open to God as he is in himself.

   Men are compared with the higher faculties because they always go
   bareheaded, and women with the lower because the head is always veiled.
   The superior powers transcend time and space, springing straight out of
   the essence of the soul, and they resemble men in always going
   uncovered. Accordingly, their working is eternal. The philosopher says
   that all the powers of the soul, inasmuch as time and space affect
   them, have lost their virgin purity and can never be so thoroughly
   abstracted nor so finely sifted as to pass into the higher faculties.
   Albeit they arc stamped with the same image.

   Do thou be firm and steady,' the same, that is to say, in weal and woe,
   in fortune and misfortune ; and set with all the precious stones,' a
   treasury, to wit, of all the virtues which come naturally pouring out
   of thee. Traverse all the virtues and, transcending them, tap virtue
   only at its source, where it is one with the divine nature. And in so
   far as thou art more atoned than are the angels with God's nature, to
   that extent they must receive through thee. May we be one, So help us
   God. Amen.

   THE DIVINE .BEING 1

   No man can tell of (iod exactly what he is. According to St Dionysius,
   God is not anything we can say or think. St Augustine cries : 1 who
   have ever been in God and ever more shall be, would sooner I had never
   been and never more should be than that we found a single word that we
   could say of God. Were we compelled to si)cak of God, in that case I
   should say : Verily, in no sense is God comprehensible nor yet
   attainable. God is what thought cannot better.' Nay, I declare God
   beggars human thought ; he transcends all human conception. No man
   knows what God is. Aught that a man could or would think of God, God is
   not aj^ll. It is the nature of the soul not to be satisfied except '
   Soe Spamer's Texte, B. 1.

   with God. But all that heart can desire is small, is insignificant
   compared with God. Yet man's thought may be never so rich or so rare
   but his desire outstrips it. So he transcends man's desire as well as
   transcending human thought.

   St Dionysius says, God i§^ naught. Meaning that God is as
   incomprehensible as naught. St Bernard says, I know not what ; God is ;
   but what I know not that he is that same is he. A heathen ^philosopher
   maintains that what we know of the First Cause is rather what we are
   ourselves than what the First Cause is. For that passes understanding.
   And in this strain the heathen doctor argues in his book, IVie Light of
   Lights, that God is super-essential, super-rational,
   super-intelligible, i,e. beyond the natural under- standing. I speak
   not of gracious understanding. By grace man may be carried to the
   length of understanding as St Paul understood who was caught up into
   the third heaven and saw unspeakable things. He saw, but was not able
   to express them. For what a man knows he knows in its cause or in its
   mode or in its effect. But in these respects God remains unknown, for
   he is the first. Further, he is modeless, i.e. undetermined. And he is
   without effect, tliat is, in his mysterious stillness. Here he abides
   apart from the names that are given him. Moses asked his name. God
   answered. He- who- is hath sent thee. Otherwise he could not tell it.
   God as simply being, in that sense he could never give himself to be
   known to creatures. Not that he could not do it, but creature could not
   understand it. -- I have often laid it down that God's lordship does
   not lie merely in his lordship over creature ; his lordship consists in
   his power to create a thousand W'orlds and dominate them all in his
   abstract essence. Therein lies his lord- ship. Dionysius and Gregory
   both teach that the divine being is not comprehensible in any sense :
   not to any wit nor any under- standing, pot even to angelic
   understanding. Its simplicity and triplicity is a thing not to be
   grasped by the human mind even at its best, nor by the angelic mind
   even at its clearest. It was said by a philosopher that w'^hoso knows
   of God that he is unknown, that man knows God. For it is the height of
   gnosis and perception to know and understand in agnosia and
   a-perception. To know him really is to know him as unknowable. As the
   master puts it : If I must speak of God, then I will say, God is
   something which is in no sense to be reached or grasped ; and I know
   nothing else about him. According to St Augustine, what we say about
   God is not true ; what we say that God is he is not ; what we say he is
   not that he is rather than what we say that he is. Nothing we can say
   of God is true. God's worth and God's perfection cannot be put into
   words. When I say inan, I have in my mind human nature. When I say
   grey^ I have in my mind

   the greyness of grey. When I say Gody I have in my mind neither God's
   majesty nor his perfection. Dionysius insists that the more we can
   abstract from God the better we shall sec him. God is such that we
   apprehend him better by negation than by affirma- tion. Hence the
   dictum of one master that to argue about God from likeness is to argue
   falsely about him, but to argue by denials is to argue about him
   correctly. Dionysius says, writing about God, He is super-essential,
   lie is super-luminous ; he attributes to him neither this nor that. For
   whatever he conceives, God far transcends it. There is no knowing him
   by likeness. Rather by attributing unlikeness may we make some approach
   to under- ; standing him. Take an illustration. Supposing I describe a
   ship \ to someone who has never seen one, then on looking at a stone he
   will plainly see that it is not a ship. And the plainer he sees that it
   is not ship-like, the more he will know about a ship. It is the j same
   with (iod. The more we can impute to him not-likeness, &gt; the nearer
   do we get to understanding him. Holy Scripture yields j us merely
   privatives. That we should credit God with matter, | form and work is
   due to our gross senses. We fail to find God one ' because we try to
   come at him by likeness. Dionysius cries,

   Friend Timothy, if thou wouldst catch the spirit of truth pursue it not
   with the human senses. It is so swift, it comes rushing.' God is to be
   sought in opposites ; in unknowing knowing shall we know God ; in
   forgetfulness of ourselves and all things even to the naked essence of
   the Godhead. Dionysius was exhorting one of his disciples. Friend,'
   quoth he, cease from all activity and empty thyself of self that thou
   mayst commune with the Sovran Good, God namely.' Pray God wc may seek
   him so that wc shall find him nevermore to lose him. Amen.

   THE SIXTH BEATITUDE

   Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt justitiaiii (Matt. 5g). Jesus went up a
   mountain to a valley, into a field, and power went out of him preaching
   to the multitude : Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness for they shall be filled.'

   Methinks this text is apt to my discourse. Blessed are they that hunger
   for righteousness and endure work and poverty here, for this is but a
   moment and will surely pass. They are blessed though not most blessed.
   Blessed are they that hunger not to be deprived of God, albeit the
   wonder is that man can be without him without whom he cannot be. St
   Augustine says it is amazing that anyone should live apart from him
   apart from whom he cannot

   live at all. They are blessed and yet not most blessed. More blessed
   those who so hunger that they cannot live without God ; that is a fiery
   affection which transforms their nature. The while a man yet finds in
   his desire or in his hope or his affection anything impermanent, he is
   not most blessed. He is blessed but not most blessed. Blessed,
   supremely blessed, are they who arc installed in the eternal now,
   transcending time and place and form and matter, unmoved by weal or woe
   or wealth or want, for in so far as things arc motionless they are like
   eternity.

   [The heaven adjoining the eternal now, wherein the angels are, is
   motionless, immoveable. But the heaven next to that which touches the
   eternal now, wherein the angels are, and betwixt (that and) the heaven
   where the sun is, is set in motion by angelic force, revolving once in
   every hundred years. The heaven the sun is in, moved by angelic force,
   goes round once a year. The heaven the moon is in, again, is driven by
   angelic force and goes round once a month. The nearer the eternal now
   the more immoveable they are, and the further off and more unlike to
   the eternal now the easier to move. The heaven of the sun and moon and
   stars is moved by the impulse of their angel, so that they arc spinning
   in this temporal now ; and the eternal now imparts their motion, that
   being so energetic that from the motion the eternal now imparts, all
   things derive their life and being. Now the lowest powers of the soul
   arc nobler than the highest part of heaven, where it adjoins the angels
   and the eternal now. Moreover, all things get their life and being from
   the motion there imparted by the eternal now ; and if that is so noble,
   then what would ye expect where the soul in her superior powers
   contacts the ground of God ? How exalted, think ye, that must be ? --
   Follow then after this now, and reach this now and possess this eternal
   now. May we stand next the eternal now and so be in possession of it.
   So help us O divine power.]

   [One master says : Grace springs from the heart of the Father and flows
   into his Son and in the oneness of them twain it proceeds from the
   Wisdom of the Son into the Gift of the Holy Ghost and in the Holy Ghost
   is sent into the soul. Grace is the face of God which is clearly
   stamped in the soul without any means by the Spirit of God, giving the
   soul the form of God. St Dionysius says : The angels are the divine
   mind. Moreover St Paul declares concerning those who live the angelic
   life here in the flesh, that into them there flows the mind of God as
   it does into the angels. He also says the intellectual light, God
   namely, has given likeness to the rational soul. Quoth St Paul : He who
   cleaves unto God with his whole being becomes one spirit with (iod. So

   IN PRINCIPIO ERAT VERBUM

   In 'principio erat verbum {Joh&gt; Ij). Theologians talk of the eternal
   Word. God never spoke but one word, and that is still unspoken. The
   explanation is this. The eternal Word is the logos of the Father which
   is his only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ. In him he pronounces
   all creatures without beginning and without end. This accounts for the
   Word remaining unborn, for it never came out of the Father. This Word
   is to be known in fourfold guise.

   First, on the altar in the priest's hands. There it is ours to know and
   love the eternal Word as we, in his eternal Word, appear to the
   heavenly Father. Secondly, we know the eternal Word as expounded by
   doctors from the chair. We receive it in their person ; like water
   flowing in a channel, so does the eternal Word flow through its
   teachers. We should pay no heed to any shortcomings in the doctor : we
   must fix our gaze on the eternal Word in him, as it comes pouring
   eternally out of the ground of itself. Thirdly, we can recognise the
   eternal Word in our Lord's friends who, having followed this eternal
   Word, have gotten proof of it in life eternal, and also those that
   follow it in time, such, namely, as arc quick in our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Fourthly, we have the eternal Word as spoken in the virgin soul by God
   himself ; wordlessly, to wit, since the soul is not able to express
   him.

   I would have you know that the eternal Word is being born within the
   soul, its very self, no less, unceasingly. I tell you, the soul knows
   the eternal Word better than all the doctors can ex- pound it. What we
   can express is all too little, so for the nonce she is bearing the
   eternal Word in mind. According to the masters we ought by rights to go
   to school where the Holy Ghost is teacher ; and know, where he is
   teacher and is bound to be, there he finds students properly equipped
   to profit by his lofty teaching which issues from out the Father's
   heart. So the soul has, if she will, the Father and the Son and Holy
   Ghost : she goes flowing into the one where naked in naked is revealed
   to her. Our masters say that no one can attain to this so long as he
   retains of nether things as much as a needle-point can carry. Into the
   naked Godhead none may get except he be as naked as he was when he was
   spilt from God.

   The masters say, giving us wise counsel, that leaving God his glory we
   ought to get all things direct from him and not from creatures. We
   shall leave God his glory by leaving him to work just how he will and
   when he will, we staying idle and free. For

   their prayer. Withal the masters do affirm that numbers go to heaven

   gloom. Desiring this supremely it rests with us to compass it by
   practice and by strength of will. Amen.

   I KNOW A MAN IN CHRIST

   Scio homwem in Christo ante annos quatuordecim etc. (2 Cor.

   St Paul declares : I know a man who fourteen years ago was caught up
   into the third heaven ; whether in the body or no I cannot tell : God
   knoweth.' Now granting Paul was there at any time, then either body and
   soul both turned to spirit or else his soul took wing out of his body.
   It is certain that his soul left not his body, for she was giving life
   unto his body; she must then have seen God in her and herself in him.

   The soul has three powers : mind, will and rage. These three powers are
   in league with deity. Will cleaving unto God can do all things. God
   seized of his divinity bestows upon her power and fecundity. Mind
   cleaving to the Son knows with the Son ; it knows with the Son when it
   is void of knowledge. The third power is the power of attack, which is
   connected with the Holy Ghost. This power is ever making for the source
   whence it ) proceeded forth and the Holy Ghost is its initiator into
   the eternal nature : it floods the secret chamber of the soul, and lo !
   she loses time and place in the eternal, in time transcending time. But
   for the soul this is not enough : had she enough she would have time in
   lieu of her eternity. Let us not flag. Not ours the blame if, being
   ready and atoned in will, God hides himself so that we cannot do all
   things with him although he plays his part just as the sun gives out
   its light and fire gives out its heat. Woodapples cannot check the
   letting of their gall, but God contrives from time to time to reach out
   to the longing soul if he is very near to her. So let her, never
   doubting, with hearty longing, hail God frequently : O Friend of me,
   how long am I to wait for thee ? '

   He says, to Christ w^as given a new name : one by the angel, another by
   St Paul, a third by his heavenly Father. The angel gave him the name
   Jesus Christ. Joseph and Mary called him by

   this name which signifies Weal of the World. The name is given to the
   wounded soul. Alas, we are too frail ! We should be well of our
   infirmities being raised up and gotten in ; we should be raised if we
   were destitute and unattached. For tlie exalted spark wherein we see
   the light divine, that never parts from God nor is there anything
   between. What matter then if good and ill and pain betide, they do but
   touch the lower faculties.

   St Paul gave him three names and called him the rclieetion of the
   Father. He says, the wounded soul is given the mystic

   heavenly bread. Whence comes her wound ? From longing.

   What is longing? -It is love. What is nobler than longing? What wc pray
   God for humbly and with longing he durst not refuse : desire ablush
   with modesty he leads into the triple chamber of the Holy Trinity.

   Paul called him also the fecundity of the Father and the image in the
   Father, working with the Father to brijig forth his Person. Verily I
   say, the soul will bring forth Person if God laughs into her and she
   laughs back to him. To speak in parable, the Father laughs into the Son
   and the Son laughs back to tlic Father ; and this laughter breeds
   liking, and liking breeds joy, and joy begets love, and love begets
   Person, and Person begets the Holy Ghost. In this wise docs he travail
   with his Father.

   The third name he gave was. The Majesty of the Substance of God.
   Majesty is the essence of his divine substance, this substance being
   the elemental matter of the three Persons. The soul is called majesty
   when she gives u]) mode : then she knows the Father and paternity, the
   Son and filiation, and the Persons of them twain she comprehends in
   unity. The Father gave him five names, ineffable. God keep us every
   whit in him. So help us God. Amen.

   Surrexit autem S aulas de terra apertisque occults nihil videbat {Act,

   narrative about St Paul. It records that Paul rose from the ground with
   open eyes and seeing nothing.' The words are open to four
   inter|&gt;retations. One is, that wdien he rose up from the ground he
   was gazing wide-eyed at naught, that naught being God, for the vision
   of God he would describe as the naught. Another explanation is that
   when he got up he saw nothing but God. The third, he saw naught but God
   in all things. I'hc fourth, that in the divine vision he beheld all
   things as a naught. He previously tells how light came suddenly from
   heaven and felled

   him to the ground. Mark you, he says that the light came from heaven.
   According to our doctors, though heaven is fraught with light it does
   not shine. The sun is full of light and shines withal. Our doctors
   teach that fire docs not give any light in the simple, natural
   perfection of its highest state. Its nature is too pure for eye in any
   wise to see. So subtle is it, so unlike the eye, that were it here
   below within our view it could not stimulate our eyes to sight. And
   yet, forsooth, we see it is absorbed by different things, such as a
   lump of coal, a piece of wood.

   By the light of heaven we see the light that is God whereto no mind of
   man is able to attain. As St Paul hath it : God dwells in a light that
   no man can approach unto.' He says, God is light inaccessible.' There
   is no admittance to God. No man still on the ascent, still on the
   increase in grace and in light, has ever yet got into God. God is no
   crescent light : we get to him by growing. In the growing procicss God
   is unseen. When God is seen it is in the light that is God himself. A
   master says, In God there is no more nor less nor this nor that. Whiles
   we are on the way we arc not there.

   He says, A light from heaven shone round about him.' Implying the
   capture of his entire soul. A master says that in this light all the
   soul-powers are exalted and raised to a higher power, the outward
   senses we see and hear with as well as the inner senses we call
   thoughts : the reach of these and their pro- fundity are most amazing.
   I can think as easily about things overseas as close at hand. Above
   thought comes the intellect, as seeker. She goes about looking, casting
   her net here and there, gaining and losing. Above intellect the seeker
   there is another intellect which does not seek but rests in its pure
   and simple essence in the realm of light. And I say it is in this light
   that all the soul -powers are exalted. Senses rise to thoughts. How
   high, how fathomless these are, that no one knows except God and the
   soul.

   Our theologians teach, and it is a knotty question, that angels know
   nothing about thoughts unless the thoughts take wing and rise up into
   intellect -- intellect the seeker ; and this intellect, the seeker,
   soars up into the intellect which does not seek, which is the pure
   light in itself. This light embraces all the powers of the soul.
   Accordingly he says, The heavenly light encircled him.'

   One master lays it down that anything which has an emanation is exempt
   from these lower things. God emanates into all creatures without being
   affected by any. He does not need them. God energises nature and her
   first work is the heart. Wherefore some doctors would pretend the soul
   is altogether in the heart and flows thereout as life into the other
   members. Not so. The

   soul is in each member, whole. True, her chief work is in the heart..
   The heart being in the middle gets protection on all sides, just as
   heaven is protected from outside influence and intrusion. It contains
   all things. It moves all things and itself remains unmoved. Not even
   fire, exalted though it be in its most high estate, can lick the
   heavens.

   In the encircling light he fell to earth, and his eyes being unsealed
   he, open-eyed, beheld all things as naught.' And beholding all things
   as naught he was beholding God. Mark here what the soul says in the
   Book of Love : By night in my bed I sought him my soul loveth : I
   sought him and I found him not.' She sought him in her bed : meaning to
   convey that any- one cleaving to aught below God has too narrow a lie.
   God's entire creation is all too confined. Quoth she, I sought him all
   night through.' There is no night without the light : only, it is
   veiled. The sun is shining in the night albeit screened from view. By
   day it shines, eclipsing all the other lights. So does the light of God
   ; it blinds and puts out any light. Our creaturely expecta- tions, all
   these are night. What I mean to say is, that nothing we find in a
   creature is more than a shadow and dark. Even the highest angel's
   light, exalted though it be, illumines not the soul. All but the first
   light is darkness, is night. By it she cannot find God. I rose and
   sought him all about, I scoured the broadways and the alleys. The
   watchmen (angels) found me, and I questioned them, " Saw ye not him
   whom my soul loveth ? " ' But they answered not ; peradventure they
   could not apprehend him. It was but a little that I passed and I found
   him my soul loveth.' The little, the trifle, that she missed him by has
   often been the burden of my teaching. He to whom mortal things are not
   all trivial and as naught withal, that man shall not find God.

   Having passed by a little,' she says, I found him whom I sought.' When
   God pours into and informs the soul and thou takes t him as a light or
   a state or a boon, whatsoever thou knowest about him, that God is not.
   We have to transcend the little, discard the adventitious and perceive
   God one. She says, When I had passed by a little I found him my soul
   loveth.'

   We are very fond of saying, him my soul loveth.' But he is far away
   above the soul, nor does she name her love. There are five reasons why
   she names him not. One is that God is nameless. Any name she gave him
   would have to be well chosen. God is beyond all name, none can express
   him. A second reason is that on swooning away into God for love, the
   soul is conscious of nothing but love. She fondly imagines that
   everyone knows him like that. She is amazed that any wight should find
   him aught but love alone. Thirdly, she has no time to name him. Love

   names. Quoth she, I rose up, I went through the broad streets and the
   alleys. And when I had passed a little I found him rny soul loveth.'

   Paul rose from the ground wide-eyed, beholding nothing.' I cannot see
   what is one. He saw nothing, to wit, God. God is naught and God is one.
   What aught is is naught as well. What God is is he altogether. As
   Dionysius says about the light : speaking of God he says. He is
   supernatural, supervital, super- luminous ; he will allow him neither
   this nor that, but makes him out to be I know not what that far
   transcends them. Aught seen, aught that may come within thy ken, that
   God is not ; for why, God is not this nor that. AVhocver says that God
   is here or there, credit him not. The light which God is shines in
   darkness. God is the true light : to sec it one has to be blind and
   strip God naked of things. A master says. To argue about God from any
   sort of likeness is to argue falsely about him. But to argue about God
   from naught is to argue soundly withal. \Vhen the soul is reduced to
   one and is gotten therein by discarding herself altogether, there she
   finds God, as it were, in a naught. It appeared to one soul as in a
   dream (it was a waking dream), to be big with naught like a woman with
   child, and in this naught God was born, the fruits of the naught. God
   was born in the naught. Therefore he says, He arose from the earth
   wide-eyed, gazing at naught.' He had a vision of God where there are no
   creatures. He beheld all creatures as naught for he had the whole
   essence of creatures in him. He is the all -containing essence.

   Another thing he means by saying, he saw naught.' Accord- ing to our
   masters, any perception of externals entails some inroad by them, an
   impression at the least. To get some idea of a thing, a stone, for
   instance, I do (not) take into my mind the grossest part of it ; that I
   leave outside. As it exists in the ground of my soul where it is at its
   noblest and best, it is merely a type (or idea). Things perceived by my
   soul from without contain an outside element : my ])creeplion of
   creature in God contains nothing but God alone, for in God there is
   nothing but God. When I sec all creatures T see not. He saw God where
   creatures are not.

   In the third place, why he saw naught. Naught was God. A master says.
   Creatures in God are as naught for he has in him the whole essence of
   creatures. He is the being that contains all beings. The master says.
   Nothing inferior to God, however nigh it might be to him, but has some
   alien taint. The master says an angel knows himself and God without
   means. Into other things he knows there comes an outside element, some
   interference still,

   however slights If we are to know God it must be without means, nothing
   foreign can come in between. When we do see God in his light it happens
   in private, safe from the slightest intrusion of creaturely things.
   Then we have immediate knowledge of eternal life.

   Seeing nothing, he saw God.' The light which is God is flowing and
   darkening every light. Concerning it Job says, He coiU' manded the sun
   not to shine and sealeih up the stars as it were with a seal.'
   Enveloped in this light he could see naught beside ; his whole soul was
   distraught, intent upon the light that is God to the exclusion of all
   else ; and this is a lesson to us, for what time we are busy with God
   we mind little what goes on without.

   Fourthly, he saw naught since the light which is God is un- mingled,
   free from admixture. It shows it ^vas the true light he beheld for
   there was nothing there. By light he simply means that he saw nothing
   with his open eyes. In that he saw not, he saw the divine naught. St
   Augustine says. When he saw nothing, he saw God. According to St Paul,
   Whoso only seeth being blind, he seeth God.' As St Augustine hath it,
   God is the true light, preserver of the soul, more nigh to her than she
   is to herself, and by the same token, when the soul turns her hac^k on
   things becoming, then God must needs shine into her. This soul knows
   neither love nor care, she is unmindful of th(*m. The soul that fares
   not forth to outside things comes home to stay in her im- partible pure
   light. She does not love nor does she fear nor care withal. Knowledge
   is the basis, the foundation of all being. Love has no hold except in
   knowledge. When the soul is blind and can see naught beside, then she
   sees God, it is inevitable. A master says, the eye at its clearest,
   without any colour, sees every colour ; not just as a colourless thing
   in itself, but in place in the body it has to be void of all colour for
   us to see colours. In colourless things all colours arc seen, aye,
   though it be down in one's feet. God is something all-embracing. For
   God to be seen by the soul she has to be blind. Accordingly he says, ^
   lie saw the naught whose light all lights are, whose being all beings
   are.' The bride says in the Book of Love : When I had passed by a
   little I found him my soul loveth.' The little she had passed all
   creatures were. Whoso putteth not these behind him shall not find God.
   And eke she would imply that however small, however pure a thing I know
   God by, yet it must go. Even the light that verily is God, if I take it
   where it plays upon my soul is foreign to him. I must take it at the
   source. I cannot really see the light that shines upon the wall unless
   I turn my gaze to w^here it comes from. But if I take it in its cause I
   am robbed of its effect. I ought to take it neither where it falls nor
   in its eruption nor yet

   AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A MAN . . . SIMEON

   Et ecce, homo erat in Jerusalem^ cui nomen Simeon etc, {Luc, 235). St
   Luke relates in his gospel that when the days were accom- plished
   Christ was brought to the temple. And behold there was a man in
   Jerusalem, Simeon by name, who was just and God- fearing, waiting for
   the consolation of the people of Israel and the Holy Ghost was in him.'

   * And behold.' This particle et in Latin signifies joining, binding or
   locking together. Things fast bound or locked together are described as
   in union. Here I refer to the soul being bound, knit, united to God.
   According to our doctors, union postulates likeness. There is no union
   without likeness. Binding or knitting together, that is the meaning of
   union. Nearness to me does not constitute likeness : my sitting by
   someone or in the same place, for example. As St Augustine says. Lord,
   when I found myself afar from thee it was not from the remoteness of
   the place, it came of thy unlikeness wherein I found myself. One master
   says, people living and working wholly in time never agree, they never
   come together. According to our doctors, a thing whose life and work is
   in eternity and a thing whose life and work is here in time require a
   go-between. Where there is knitting and binding together there must be
   some likeness. The union of God and the soul is a matter of likeness.
   Where no difference exists there must be identity ; not merely union in
   mutual embrace, but one ; not merely likeness, but the same. Wherefore
   we say that the Son is not like the Father but he is his image, he is
   one with the Father.

   One of our best doctors says that an image in stone or on the wall,
   with no foundation to it, taken simply as a form, is the same form as
   his whose form it is. For the soul passing into her exemplar wherein is
   no alien thing, only her form wherewith it is one, this doctrine holds
   good. Having gotten the form that is divine we behold God, we find God.
   In separation God is not found. On passing into her exemplar and
   finding herself in that image alone, in that same image the soul finds
   God and the finding of herself and God, which is all the same act and
   is timeless, is the finding of God. So far as she is therein so far she
   is one with God, He means :

   as far as a man is at the stage where his soul is the divine image.
   Then so far as he is he is divine. So far therein so far in God, not
   annexed, not united but one and the same.

   One master says, likeness means birth. Further he states that like is
   not met with in nature unless it is born. Doctors declare that fire,
   however fierce, would never burn had it no hope of propagation. However
   dry the wood supplied it would never catch (if fire) lacked power to
   generate its kind. What fire wants is to be born in wood, for all to be
   one fire, living and lasting. Extinguished and dead it were fire no
   more, so it wants to keep in. The nature of the soul would never have
   gotten its kind were it not for her wanting to have God begotten in her
   ; she would not have proceeded into her nature, would never have wanted
   to enter therein, except in the hope of this birth ; nor would God ever
   have brought it to pass had he not meant the soul to be born into him.
   God docs and the soul desires. God has the energy and the soul has the
   will and the power to have God born into her and her- self into God.
   This God contrives with intent that the soul shall be like him. She
   must needs wait for God to be gotten in her and for her treasure to
   grow into God, desiring union and the safe- keeping of God. God's
   nature pours into the light of the soul and therein she is preserved.
   God purposes thus to be born into her, united with her, contained in
   her.- -How can that be ? Do we not say that God contains himself ? --
   When he draws in the soul she finds that God is self-contained and
   there she stays abiding nowhere else. Augustine says : As thou lovest
   so thou art : loving earth thou art earthly, loving God thou shalt be
   divine.' If I love God then, shall I be God ? It is not I who say so ;
   search the scriptures. In the Prophets God says : Ye are gods and the
   children of the Most High.' I say that it is in his likes that God
   gives this birth. Had she no expectation of this the soul would not
   want to attain it. She wants to be preserved in him, he is her life.
   God has a preserve, a safe place in himself, which man can know nothing
   about until he pares off and is rid of all that belongs to the soul --
   her life, her powers, her nature, all must go. And that means standing
   in that perfect light where she and God are one form, where she finds
   herself God. It is characteristic of God to have nothing alien in him,
   nor on him nor added to him. And likewise it behoves the soul to have
   no outside impressions, nothing put on, nothing annexed. So much for
   the first (word).

   And behold ' : ecce. This word ecce has all the meaning of logos (or
   word) and it could be given no greater. Word, i.e, God. God is a word,
   God's Son is a word. It conveys the idea of our life nnd all our desire
   being centred in and dependent upon and odented to God. As St Paul

   that I am.' And again, I live, yet not I but God liveth in me.' What
   more ?

   Homo erat. He says, Behold, a man.' We use the word homo for women as
   well as for men, but the Latins refused it to woman because of her
   weakness. Homo denotes something whole, nothing lacking. Homo, a man, a
   mortal, means one pertaining to earth, implying humility. Earth is the
   basest of the elements and placed in the midst with the heavens all
   round, it lies open to every celestial emanation. All the work and
   waste of heaven is caught midway in the sink of earth. Homo in yet
   another sense means moisture ; as much as to say, one who is watered
   with grace ; referring to those humble souls who receive the immediate
   influx of grace. In this inflowing grace there forthwith arises that
   light of the mind into which God is sending a ray of his unclouded
   splendour. In this powerful light a mortal is as far above his fellows
   as a live man is above his shadow on the wall. This light is vastly
   potent, not merely being in itself exempt from time and place, but
   anything it falls upon it robs of time and place and bodily semblance
   and everything extraneous thereto. As I have often said before, were
   there no time nor place nor aught beside it would be all one being. The
   man who is in this sense one and casts himself into the ground of
   humility, there will be watered with grace.

   Concerning the third point : this light deprives of time and place.
   There was a man.' Who gave him this light ? The light did. This word
   erat belongs expressly to God. In the Latin tongue there is no word so
   proper to God as erat John in his gospel comes to using erat as a
   synonym for pure being. Things are all extras : but addition is
   possible only in thought ; not by mental addition but by mental
   abstraction. Goodness and truth are additions, in theory at least, but
   the abstract essence without anything to it is what is meant by erat
   Again, erat implies birth, an end of becoming. I was coming to-day, now
   I have come ; and if we eliminate time from my coming and having
   arrived, then coming and come close up into one. Where coming and come
   coincide, there we are born and re-made and re-formed into his
   primitive form. I have often said that all the while a thing's aught is
   a matter of concrete existence it never will be re-created ;
   refurbished it may be and coloured afresh, even as a seal that is old :
   that is restamped and renewed. A heathen doctor says, Things yonder no
   time can stale ; there is the blessed life in the evermore : faultless,
   care-free, unalloyed being. Solomon says : There is nothing new under
   the sun,' though this is seldom taken in its proper sense. Everything
   under the sun grows old and dies, but yonder is nothing but new. Time
   brings two things : age and

   In Jerusalem. Jerusalem meaning vision of peace ; it stands, in short,
   for man's peace and prosperity. It possibly signifies more. Paul says,
   The peace that passeth all understanding keep your hearts and minds.'
   Pray God we may be such as to enter into this peace, which is himself.
   So help us God. Amen.

   HE THAT HATETH HIS SOUL

   Qui odit animam suam in hoc mundo in vitam ceternum custodial earn
   (Joh» 1235). I quote in Latin the gospel saying of our Lord, He that
   hateth his soul in this world shall keep it in eternal life.' Now mark
   what it is our Lord means when he speaks of a man hating his soul. He
   that loveth his soul in this mortal life and as she exists in this
   world shall lose her in eternal life ; but he that hateth her mortal
   guise shall keep her unto life eternal.

   There are two reasons for his using here the word soul. Accord- ing to
   one authority soul is a name for the ground (or soil) and has nothing
   to do with the nature (or ground) of the soul. As a master has said,
   Whoso discourses of moveable things trenches not on the nature or
   ground of the soul. Try to name the soul as she is in herself, in her
   pure and abstract nature, and not a name can wc find. They call her
   soul as they call a carpenter, neither a human being nor after any
   being at all but after his work. What our Lord means is this : he that
   loveth his soul in her nakedness, her impartible soul-nature, to wit,
   will hate and despise her in this dress. She hates and detests and rues
   being so far from the pure light she is in herself.

   Our doctors say the soul is called fire because of the force and
   because of the heat and because of the light that is in her. Others
   declare she is a spark of the celestial nature. A third school calls
   her a light. A fourth calls her a breath. A fifth dubs her a number.
   They are trying to describe the soul by something pure and luminous.
   Number exists in the angels and in light there is number as well, but
   to name her after the highest and after fhe brightest is still to fall
   short of the ground of the soul. God is nameless is ineffable and in
   her ground the soul too is

   ineffable as he is ineffable. There is another reason for his saying
   that she hates. This term we apply to the soul is the name of the soul
   as she is in the prison of the body, so he means the soul in her
   individual state, still at the stage of taking thought, still in her
   prison-house. By taking thought for these nether things, by taking them
   in by her senses at all, she is confined : words cannot name any higher
   nature within her.

   There are three reasons why my soul should hate herself. The first,
   that in so far as she is mine she is not God's. The second, because my
   soul is not wholly imbedded and set and re-cast into God. Augustine
   says, To have God for one's own one must needs first be God's. The
   third reason is : the soul's enjoying herself as the soul while
   enjoying God with the soul, which is wrong. She should be enjoying God
   in herself since he is entirely hers. As Christ says, he that loveth
   his soul shall lose it.' What the soul is in this world or beholds in
   this world : things comprehended, apparent at all, she shall hate. A
   master declares that the soul at her highest and purest transcends the
   whole world, nothing attach- ing the soul to the world but affection.
   Sometimes she has a natural love of the body. Sometimes she has a will
   inclined towards creatures. Another says the soul has no natural
   concern with the things of this world any more than the ear has with
   colour or the eye has with song. Our natural philosophers teach that
   the body is much rather in the soul than the soul is in the body. Even
   as the cask contains the wine and not the wine the cask, so does the
   soul keep the body in her rather than the body the soul. What the soul
   loves in this world she is pure from by nature. According to one
   philosopher, it is the soul's nature and her natural end to achieve
   within herself a feat of understanding, God informing her with the
   general idea. He that can say he has attained his nature finds all
   things within himself, fashioned in light as they are in God ; not as
   they are in nature but as they are in God. Neither spirit nor angel
   touches the ground or nature of the soul. In it she comes into the
   first, into the beginning, whence God breaks out in goodness into all
   creatures. There she loves all things in God, not pure as they are in
   her uncompounded nature, but merely impartible as they are in God. God
   has made this whole world as it were out of coal. Its pattern in gold
   is more lasting than this one in coal. Likewise the things in the soul
   are purer and nobler than they are in this world. The material which
   God made things out of is (to its exemplar in God) baser than coal is
   to gold. For the purpose of making a crock a man takes a handful of
   clay ; that^is the medium he works in. He gives it a form he has in
   him, nobler than^^his material. And the moral of this is that the
   things in the intelligible world, the soul, to wit, ffxe
   in.fi;&gt;itely nobler

   than they are in this ; even as the image hewn and graven in gold so
   the types of all things are onefold in the soul. A master says, The
   soul has a natural gift for being impressed with the forms of all
   things. Another one says. Never did soul get to her virgin nature
   without finding all things imaged therein in the intelligible world
   which is incompreljensiblc, unthinkable. Gregory says : All reasoning
   in words about divine things is but a stammering.

   One word more about the soul and I have done. O ye daughters of
   Jerusalem, look not upon me because I am brown I The sun hath coloured
   me and the children of my mother have striven against me ' {Cant, I5).
   She refers to the children of this world, to them the soul speaks. The
   sun is the lust of this world : the visible, tangible things thereof do
   turn me swarthy and brown. Brown is not a pure colour : it is part
   light and part darkness. When the soul thinks or acts with her powers
   how enlightened soever these be, still, there is confusion. And
   therefore she says,

   ' My mother's children have striven against me.' These children being
   the lower powers of the soul, all clashing and at strife with her. The
   heavenly Father is our father and Christendom is our mother. What
   though she be fair and well-favoured and good at her work, yet this is
   not perfect. Wherefore he cries, O thou fairest among women go forth
   and depart.' This world is like a woman, weak. But why does he address
   her, O fairest among women ? ' The angels are fair and arc far above
   the soul. He says, fairest ' : in her light-nature. Go forth and depart
   ' ; go forth from this world and depart from such things as thy soul is
   still prone to. And anything grasped let her hate.

   When I preach it is my wont to speak about detachment, of the duty of
   ridding ourselves of self and of things. Or again, of return to the
   impartible good, God to wit. And thirdly, on the duty of remembering
   the high and noble nature God has put into the soul so that mortals may
   wonder about God. Fourthly, about the pure nature of God, the ineffable

   is saying this Word ; where he does not exist he says nothing. God is
   spoken and unspoken. The Father is the speaking energy and the Sun is
   the speech energising. What is in me goes forth of me ; I have but to
   think and my word goes forth, at the same time abiding within. Even so
   does the Father speak forth his Son who meanwhile remains in him
   unspoken. I have repeatedly said, God's exit is his entrance. In
   proportion to my nearness to God does he speak himself into me. In the
   case of rational creatures the more they go out of themselves in their
   works the more they get into themselves. Not so with corporal things :
   the more active these are the further they get from themselves. All
   creatures desire to speak God in their works : they all of them speak
   him as well as they can but they cannot really pronounce him.
   Willy-nilly, in weal or in woe they are all trying to utter God who yet
   remains unspoken.

   David said, The Lord is his name.' Lord means one set in authority ;
   knox)e means an underling. Some names are proper to God and forbidden
   to aught beside God. God is the name peculiar to God just as 7nan is
   the name for mankind. A man is a man be he foolish or wise. Seneca
   says, 'Tis a vile man that excels not humanity.' Anotlier name we
   associate with God is paternity. When wc call a man father y we take
   for granted a son. No father can be without having a son. True, they
   merge, beyond time, into eternal nature. The third name in its higher
   sense relates to God and in its lower one to time. God is called by
   many names in scripture. Now I say, anything wc can think of in God or
   put any name to, that God is not. God transcends name, transcends
   nature. Wc hear of one good man who in prayers besought God for his
   name. Then, Peace ! ' quoth a brother,

   thou art abasing God.' Wc can lind no name to give to God ; but we arc
   permitted to use the names his saints have called him by, those whose
   hearts inspired by God were Hooded with his divine light. Hence we
   learn, first, how to pray to God. Wc ought to say. Lord, in those very
   names which thou didst instil into the hearts of saints, suffusing them
   with thy light, wc praise thee and adore thee. And secondly we learn
   that in giving God no name at all we praise and honour him suflicicntly
   since God is above name and ineffable.

   Out of the fullness of his power the Father speaks the Son and in iiim
   all things. All creatures arc the utterance of God. Like as my lips
   proclaim and tell forth God so does a stone's existence, and we can
   glean more from the fact than from the telling of it. Work wrought by
   highest nature in its sovran power a lower nature cannot comprehend. If
   it did the selfsame work then would it not be lower, but the same.
   Creatures all want to copy

   God in all they do. But it is precious little they are able to reveal.
   Even the highest angels, inasmuch as they ascend and come in touch with
   God, are no more like than black and white to that which is in God. It
   is altogether different, what creatures have received, yet they all
   desire to speak as nearly as possible the same. The prophet says :
   Lord, thou sayest one and I understand two.' When God speaks into the
   soul, as it falls it divides. The higher we soar in our understanding
   the more we arc in him. In eternity, the Father is speaking his Son all
   the time and i^ouring forth all creatures in him. They all have a call
   to return whence they came forth. Their whole life and nature is a
   vocation, a flight back to what they came out of.

   The prophet says : The TiOrd sent forth his hand,' meaning the Holy
   Ghost. He says, he touched my mouth,' and straightway there follow the
   words, he spake unto me.' The mouth of the soul is the highest part of
   the soul and she has this in mind when she says, he hath put lus Word
   into my mouth,' this being the kiss of the soul ; mouth to mouth the
   Father conveys his Son into the soul, then he speaks to hi*r, saying,
   Lo, this day I have chosen thee to set thee over nations and over

   time is not, there is ever to-day. And 1 have set thee over nations,'
   i,e, above this world which thou must be rid of ; and over kingdoms,'
   meaning, that more than one thing is too much ; it behoves thee to die
   to all things and get back to the height where we dwell in the Holy
   Ghost. Amen.

   THE SFIHIT OF THE LOHD

   Spiritus dotnini replcvit orhem terrarum etc, {Saj). I 7 ). The

   spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world.'

   A philosopher says, All creatures bear witness to the divine ?iature
   whence they proceeded forth, in their will to emulate the Deity they
   came from.

   Creatures proceed forth in two ways. The first is a radical process,
   like I'oots coming out of a tree. The second emanation is by mode of
   will. Behold the twofold emanation of divinity. One the descent of the
   Son from the Father, this after tlie manner of a birth. The other, the
   outpouring of the love of Father and Son, the Holy Ghost, to wit, for
   in him they love one another. All creatures proclaim their origin,
   their divine descent betrays itself in their works. According to a
   Greek philosopher, God

   keeps all creatures in leash, as it were, and they must follow where he
   leads. Hence nature is aye making for the highest.

   The second emanation is the Holy Ghost, by mode of will. Nature would
   fain make nothing but the Son ; were she allowed she would do father's
   work, so nature would be ever giving sons did she not suffer accidental
   lapses. When nature is working in time and space then father and son
   are different. One master explains that a carpenter building a house
   will erect it first in his mind and, were the house subject enough to
   his will, then, materials apart, the only difference between them would
   be that of begetter and suddenly begotten. Lo, thus it is in God, for
   since there is no time nor place in him, therefore they are one God,
   there being no distinction save outpouring and outpoured.

   According to the scriptures, The spirit of the Lord hath filled the
   whole world.' Why is he called Lord ? Because he fills us. Why is he
   called spirit ? Because he unites us with himself. A lord is known by
   three signs. First, he is rich. Rich means possessing all things
   without stint. Hence none is really rich but God in whom all things are
   harboured indivisibly. So he can give all things and this is the second
   sign of riches. A philosopher says, God hawks himself to all creatures
   and each takes as much as it wants. I trow God offers himself to me as
   he docs to the highest angel and were I as apt as he is I should
   receive as he does. As I have often observed, God always behaves as
   though he was trying to please the soul. The third sign of riches is,
   giving for love ; whoso giveth for aught is not really rich. God's
   richness is shown by his giving all his gifts gratis. As saith the
   prophet,

   Thou art my God, thou needest not my possessions.' He alone is the Lord
   and the spirit. I say, he is spirit ; our happiness lies in union with
   him.

   The most excellent work of God in creature is being. My father gives me
   my nature but he does not give me my being : God does that, none
   beside. That is why everything that exists takes such a shrewd delight
   in being. The being of the soul receives the influx of God's light ;
   not pure and limpid as God sends it forth but in ambient undulations.
   We can see the sunlight where it falls upon a tree or any other object,
   but we fail to appre- hend the sun itself. And so with any gift of God
   : these arc all meted out according to the taker not according to the
   giver.

   A philosopher says, God is the standard of measure,' and so far as one
   mortal contains more God than another, to that extent he is wiser and
   nobler and better than the other. To have more of God simply means
   being more like him : the more God's likeness exists in us the more
   spiritual we are. A philosopher says, Where the lowest spirit ends the
   highest bodily thing begins.' All of

   which goes to prove that God being spirit, the least of spiritual
   things excels the best of corporal things. Soul is more excellent than
   anything bodily. Soul is contained in a place, as it were, betwixt time
   and eternity, touching them both. With her higher powers she is in
   touch with eternity ; in her inferior powers she is in contact with
   time. Thus, mark you, in time she does not function according to time
   but in her eternal nature which she has in common with the angels.
   Spirit is a subtle thing, bringing life to all the limbs in virtue of
   the close accord of soul with body. Albeit spirit is rational, and does
   the entire work, yet we do not say, my soul docs so and so, for both of
   them together are a man. This fact I may make bold to state : because
   of the intimate union of the body and the soul the soul is in the
   smallest member as much as in the body as a whole. St Augustine says,
   The union of body and soul may be close, but closer still is the union
   that spirit has with spirit.' Lo, he is Lord and spirit, may he beatify
   us by uniting us with him.

   It is a puzzling question how the soul survives when God imprints
   himself in her. Consider. Were God to give her any outward being she
   would scorn it ; but when he gives her himself in himself she receives
   and suffers in his and not in her own, his being hers : he has fetched
   her out of her own so his is now hers and hers really is his. So she
   suffers in union with God. This is the spirit of the Lord which has
   filled the whole world. Amen.

   ST JOHN SAW IN A VISION

   St John saw in a vision a lamb standing on Mount Sion and with l^m
   stood forty and four who were not of this world nor had they wifely
   names. These were all virgins who stood next the lamb, and when the
   lamb inclined they inclined with him, singing with the lamb a new song
   and having their names and the name of their Father written in their
   foreheads.

   John says, I looked and lo, a lamb stood on the mountain.' I say, John
   himself was that mountain whereon he saw the lamb, and whoso sees the
   Lamb of God must himself be the mountain, ascending to his highest,
   purest part.

   Again. He says he saw a lamb standing upon a mountain : when one thing
   stands upon another its lowest point touches the other's highest. God
   touches all things and remains untouched. God is above all things
   standing in himself and his instance sus- tains all creatures.
   Creatures have an uppermost and undermost, ^od has not. God is over
   everything and is not touched by

   anything. All creatures seek outside themselves, in one another, what
   they lack. God does not. God does not look outside him- self :
   everything that creatures have God has entire in him ; he is the floor,
   the roof of ereatures. True, one is prior to another down to the very
   last, one being born before another : though ereature gives not of her
   being to him, yet she keeps some of his. God is a simple presence, a
   stay-at-home in himself. With any creature, as regards her noble
   nature, the more she sits at home the more of herself she gives out. A
   common stone, like limestone, for example, gives itself out a stone and
   nothing more. But a precious stone, this has great power because of
   something in it, some interior fastness wherein it rears its head and,
   so to speak, peers out. According to the masters, no creature is so
   stay-at- home as body and soul, nor goes so far afield as the soul's
   highest part.

   He says, I saw a lamb standing.' From which we learn four things.
   First, the lamb is fed and clothed and that in goodly fashion, which to
   our mind looks as though we, having gotten so much from God and that so
   goodly, arc bound to seek in all we do only his honour and his glory.
   Again, the lamb stood. It is good for friend to stand by friend. God
   stands by us, is standing by us, steady and unmoved. He says : There
   stood with him a multi- tude, each having written in his forehead his
   name and the name of his Father.' liCt at least God's name be written
   in us. We must bear God's image in us and liis light must lighten us,
   if we would be John.

   THE LORD HATH SENT HIS ANGEL

   Nunc scio vere, quia misii doininus angelum swum {Act Freed from his
   prison bonds by the power of the supreme God, Peter exclaims, Now I
   know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered
   me out of the power of Herod, out of the hand of the enemy.'

   We will reverse the words and say, The Lord hath sent his angel,
   therefore I know of a surety.' Peter symbolises intuition. As I have
   often said, intuition and intellect do not unify the soul in God.
   Intellect is a matter of pure being. Intuition, its fore- runner, goes
   ahead and penetrates to what is born there : God's onc-begotten Son.
   Our Lord declares, in Matthew, that no one knows the Father but the
   Son. Now, philosophers say under- standing lies in likeness. Some of
   them say the soul is made of all things since she is capable of
   understanding all things. That sounds ridiculous, but it is true. They
   say that anything I know must

   be wholly present to me in the likeness of my understanding. But
   according to the saints, power is in the Father, likeness in the Son
   and union in the Holy Ghost. Hence, if the Father is all present to the
   Son and the Son is all-to like him, therefore no one knows the Father
   but the Son.

   Peter says, Now I know of a surety.' Why does he know of a surety ?
   Because it is divine light which does not deceive. And because we see
   in it quite clearly without anything to hide the view. Paul says
   concerning it : God dwells in light inacces- sible.' Doctors declare
   that the wisdom we learn here stays with us yonder. St Paul says it
   will go. A philosopher once said, Real knowledge, even in this body, is
   intrinsically so delightful that the sum-total of created things is
   nothing to the joys of pure perception.' Yet noble though it be, it is
   but contingent ; as one small word to all the world even thus
   insignificant is all the wisdom we learn here compared with the whole
   and perfect truth. Look you. Paul says it goes. And even if it stayed
   it would turn to foolishness and be as nothing to the actual truth we
   see. Thirdly, we surely know, for things seen here as changing we see
   as changeless there where we get them as a whole and indivisible,
   approximately one, things widely sundered here being close together
   there where all things are at hand : both the first day and the last
   arc happening at the present instant yonder.

   Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel.' When the
   Lord sends his angel to the soul she becomes sure- knowing. Not
   unjustly God ordained Peter should keep the key. For Peter stands for
   intuition, and it is intuition with the key that unlocks and goes in
   and finds God face to face, whereupon she notifies her find to her
   partner, will, she having had the will before, for what I will I seek.
   Perception leads the way. It is the princess seeking the prince upon
   the mountain- top, in virgin realms ; she proclaims him to the soul and
   soul to nature and nature to the passions of the body. So noble is the
   soul at her highest and her best, the doctors cannot find her any name.
   They call her anima because she animates the body.

   Theologians say that next to the first emanation of the Godhead, when
   the Son breaks out of the Father, his angel is most like to God. True,
   soul is like to God in her highest part, but this angel is even more
   like God. All that belongs to this angel is godlike. The angel was sent
   to the soul to bring her back to the very same form wherein he is
   formed, for knowledge comes by likeness. The soul is capable of knowing
   all things and she never rests till she attains her original form
   wherein all things are one ; it is there she rests, in God. In God one
   creature is no better than another. According to the masters, being and
   knowing are the same, for

   things that are not are not known and things that are most are most
   known. God has transcendent being, so he transcends all knowing, as I
   said in my first sermon two days back. The soul, informed with
   primitive light, sealed with the seal of pure being, smacking of God
   prior to truth and gnosis, with every named nature sloughed away : the
   soul (I say) at this stage of all-perfect know- ledge has gotten being
   to match. As St Paul says, God dwells in light inaccessible.' He hangs
   suspended in his own pure being whereto naught is attached. He is
   merely a presence in himself, where neither this nor that exists, for
   what is in God is God.

   A heathen says. They that hang under God arc hanging in God, and while
   having real subsistence in themselves do yet impend in him who has
   neither end nor beginning, for in God nothing alien betides. Heaven
   affords us an example. It never takes in aliens as aliens. And by the
   same token, what gets to God is changed : however vile it be, on
   bringing it to God it sheds its self. For in- stance, I may have wisdom
   but not be it. I can gain wisdom and can also lose it. But what is
   God's is God ,* it cannot leave him. It is implanted in God's nature ;
   God's nature being so stable that anything to do with it is settled in
   it once for all or always stops outside. Now reflect and marvel I If
   God converts vile things into himself, how ween ye he will treat the
   soul, which he has dignified with his own image ?

   THE FEAST OF THE VIRGIN

   JEmulor enim vos dei cemulatione etc, {2 Cor. llg). In the name of our
   Lord. We read on the Feast of the Virgin the words of St Paul, I have
   espoused you to one husband, Christ, rejuvenant.' The masters ask, Has
   the Son been born ? ' We say, no ! The masters ask, Is the Son going to
   be born ? ' We say, no I The masters are answered : the Son is fully
   born, he is being born anew unceasingly. St Paul says, Christ is the
   power of God and the wisdom of God.' His power is his wisdom and his
   wisdom is his power. Christ is the man whose youth is perennially
   renewed.

   Now St Paul says, To this man I have espoused you.' For as marriage
   between man and wife is binding, so there is eternal marriage between
   your souls and God. A maid is given to a man hoping to bear his child.
   And God did make the soul intending her to bear in her his one-begotten
   Son. The happening of this birth in Mafy ghostly was to God better
   pleasing than his being bom of her in flesh. And this same birth to-day
   in the God-loving soul delights God more than his creation of the
   heavens and earth.

   The philosophers say the soul is bigger than the heavens. St John says
   : He who sat upon the throne declared, " Behold, I make all things
   new." ' Now, according to St Augustine, God's speaking is his
   child-bearing and his child-birth is his Word.' God spake never a word
   but one and that he holds so dear that he will never say another. If
   God stopped saying his Word, but for an instant even, heaven and earth
   would disappear. Augustine says : As the marriage of man and woman is
   for good and all, so is the marriage of the soul.' The highest power of
   the soul, the one for ever straining up to God, is called the man. The
   lower power, the one that is condemned to wander among mortals, is the
   maid. The higher power, the man, goes all uncovered. But the lower
   power, the maid, is closely veiled and this lower power is taken to the
   higher. To this nature it belongs to be always active. It tries all the
   time, father-like, to beget ; and were it not prevented, a son would be
   always being born as with the heavenly Father. But what God does of his
   free gift (man's) nature hinders and a girl is born ; but were there
   neither time nor place nor matter, man would rejuvenate himself as the
   Son does the Father, always.

   God said : Behold I make all things fruitful.' Then why am I myself not
   fruitful ? God first bears his image in the God-loving soul and
   afterwards himself. If God gave himself to the soul here in time she
   would be vexed. So he gives her himself in eternity, in the perennial
   now, up-springing freshly without ceasing. She is too curious to rest
   until she finds her source. This is quite plain from Philip's words :
   Show us the Father and we shall be satisfied.' As the eternal Son of
   God comes welling up in his paternal heart, so he wells up in the
   God-loving soul. Mortal things work outwardly, ghostly things work
   inwardly. The soul this birth once happens in, that soul is nigh let
   into God ; if it happens twice she gets still more into God. The more
   frequent this birth the deeper in God and the closer knit into the
   Father's heart. This birth transcends here and now. Here^ that is,
   place ; noWy that is, time. It befalls in eternity. May we, being born
   in him, enable him to bear himself in us. So help us Father, Son and
   Holy Ghost. Amen.

   REJOICE IN THE LORD

   Rejoice in the Lord alway,' he says. Jerome declares that none receives
   knowledge nor wisdom nor honour from God

   except he be a virtuous man. No virtuous man is he who, changing not
   his ways, docs not receive from God knowledge and wisdom and joy. He
   says again : Rejoice in the Lord.' Not in our Lord but in the I^ord. I
   have repeatedly explained that God's lordship consists not alone in his
   being lord of all creatures : his lordship consists in having the power
   to create a thousand worlds and to transcend them every one in his pure
   essence : therein lies his lordship.

   Rejoice in the Lord (alway),' he says. And here we note two precepts.
   First, that we must remain all within in the Lord, not looking for him
   outside whether in knowledge or in love : simply rejoice within in the
   Lord. The other precept is : rejoice in his innermost in his first,
   whence all things get their joy and take their being. That is the
   meaning of Rejoice alway.' As St Augustine hath it, He rejoices all the
   time who is rejoicing above time and timelcssly.' Then he goes on to
   say: Have no more care. The Lord is present, is at hand.' The soul must
   needs cast off all care what time she is rejoicing in the Lord,
   leastwise on her union with God. And hence his words, Have no more care
   : the Lord is present, he is nigh.' In other words, God is with us in
   our inmost soul, provided he find us within and not gone out on
   business with our five senses. The soul must stop at home in her
   innermost, purest self ; be ever within and not flying out : there God
   is present, God is nigh.

   Another meaning of the particle by which he employs. He is in himself,
   not going far out but remaining all by himself. Quoth David ; Rejoice,
   my soul, O Lord, for unto thee have I lifted her up.' The soul must put
   forth all her strength to lift herself above herself and be translated
   beyond time and place into the void where God is in and by himself, not
   going out nor eke in touch with any outside thing. Jerome remarks that
   God can no more have recourse to time and temporal things than stones
   can have angelic wisdom.' He says: The Lord is nigh.' Quoth David: God
   is nigh unto all them that call upon him, that call upon him in truth
   and invoke him.' How to call upon him, to call upon him in truth, to
   invoke him, that I leave aside. But he uses the words in truth.' The
   Son alone is the truth and not the Father, save in the sense that they
   are one truth in their essence. That is truth which reveals what I have
   in my heart without likeness. This revelation is truth. The Son alone
   is the truth. The whole content of the Father's love he speaks at once
   in his Son. This utterance, this act, is the truth.

   He goes on to say : Your thoughts arc known unto him in the Lord,' i.e.
   in this truth with the Father. Faith inheres in in- tellectual light
   and sight in the combative faculty which is always

   aspiring to the highest and the purest : to the truth, where God is in

   THE ANGEL GABRIEL WAS SENT^

   Missus est Gabriel angelus etc. {Luc. Ige). St Luke says in his gospel,
   the angel was sent from God into a land called Galilee, into a town
   called Nazareth, to a virgin called Mary, who was of the house of
   David.' According to Bede, the theologian, this was the beginning of
   our salvation. I have said before and say again that everything our
   Lord has ever done he did simply to the end that God miglit be with us
   and that we might be one with him, and that is the reason why God was
   made man. The masters say that God was ever being born in our Lady
   ghostly ere ever he was born of her in flesh, and from the overflow of
   that begetting wherein the heavenly Father begat his one-begotten Son
   within her soul the eternal Word received its human nature in her and
   she became with carnal child.

   He says, the angel was sent from God.' The soul would scorn to have the
   angelic light were it not sent to her from God ; if there were not
   concealed in it the light of God to make the angel's light detectable,
   she would have none of it.

   He says, the angel.' What is an angel ? Three doctors give three
   different definitions of what an angel is. Dionysius says, An angel is
   a mirror without flaw and passing clear containing the reflection of
   God's light. Augustine says, An angel is nigh unto God and matter is
   nigh unto him. John Damascene says. An angel is a reflection of God and
   through all that is his there is shining the image of God. The soul has
   this image in her summit whereon the light of God for ever shines. This
   is his first definition of an angel. Later on he calls him a dividing
   sword, aflame with divine desire, and, he adds, angels are free and
   inimical to matter.'

   He says, the angel was sent from God.' What for ? Accord- ing to
   Dionysius, an angel has three functions. First, he purifies, next he
   enlightens, and lastly he perfects. He purifies the soul from stain,
   i.e. he purges her from matter and gathers her together to herself,
   cleansing her from foulness as one angel does another. Then he
   enlightens her in twofold fashion. Divine light is so overwhelming that
   the soul is unable to bear it unless it is tempered in the angel's
   light and so conveyed into the soul. He enlightens

   her therefore by reflection. The angel conveys his own knowledge to the
   soul and strengthens her in this way to bear the light of God.

   If I were in a wilderness alone and was afraid, the presence of a child
   would dissipate my dread and give me courage, so noble, so blithe a
   thing is life. Failing a child, a beast would comfort me. Hence
   necromancers use an animal, a dog (for instance), the animal's vitality
   invigorating them. Knowledge is power. The angel conveyed it to the
   soul in preparation for the light of God.

   He says, the angel was sent from God.' The soul must be like an angel
   in the ways that I have named if the Son is to be sent to her and born
   in her. But there remains the question of how the angel perfects her.
   May God send his angel to us. So help us God. Amen.

   THE ANGEL GABRIEL WAS SENT

   Missus est Gabriel angelus (Luc. Ige). In time the angel Gabriel was
   sent from God.' In what time ? In the sixth month, John being then
   quick within his mother's womb. When anyone asks me, Why do we pray or
   why do we fast or do our work withal, I say, So that God may be born in
   our souls. What were the scriptures written for and why did God create
   the world and the angelic nature ? Simply that God might be born in the
   soul. All cereal nature means wheat, all treasure nature means gold,
   all generation means man. As the philosopher says. No animal exists but
   has somewhat in common with mankind in time. First of all when a word
   is conceived in my mind it is a subtle, intangible thing ; it is true
   word when it takes shape in my thought. Later, as spoken aloud by my
   mouth, it is but an outward expression of the interior word. Even so
   the eternal Word is spoken in the inner- most and purest recesses of
   the soul, in the summit of her rational nature, and there befalls this
   birth. Whoso has nothing more than a firm belief in and lively
   conviction of this will be glad to know how this birth comes to pass
   and what conduces to it.

   St Paul says : In the fullness of time God sent his Son.' St Augustine
   was asked what it meant, this fullness of time. It is the fullness (or
   end) of the day when the day is done : then the day is over. Certain it
   is that there is no time where this birth befalls, for nothing hinders
   this birth so much as time and creature. It is an obvious fact that
   time affects neither God nor the soul. Did time touch the soul she
   would not be soul. If God were affected by time he would not be God.
   Further, if time could touch the soul, then God could not be bom in
   her. The soul wherein God is born must have escaped from time, and time
   must

   have dropped away from her ; she must be absolutely one in will and
   desire.

   Another fullness of time. If someone had the knowledge and the power to
   gather up the time and all the happenings of these six thousand years
   and all that is to come ere the world ends to boot, all this, summed up
   into one present now, would be the fullness of time. This is the now of
   eternity, when the soul knows all things in God, as new and fresh and
   lovely as I find them now at present. The narrowest of the powers of my
   soul is more than heaven wide. To say nothing of the intellect wherein
   there is measureless space, wherein I am as near a place a thousand
   miles away as the spot I am standing on this moment. Theologians teach
   that the angel hosts are countless, the number of them cannot be
   conceived. But to one who sees distinctions apart from multiplicity and
   number, to him, I say, a hundred is as one. Were there a hundred
   Persons in the Godhead he would still perceive them as one God.

   As regards the angels. The angels, of whatever rank, abet and assist at
   God's birth in the soul ; that is to say, they have satisfac- tion,
   they delight and rejoice in this birth. Nothing is wrought by the
   angels : the birth is due to God alone and anything that ministers
   thereto is work of service. May God be born in us, So help us God.
   Amen.

   VISION IS THE WHOLE REWARD'

   Beatus es, Simon Bariona, quia caro et sanguis non revelavit tibi^ sed
   pater meus, qui in coelis est {Matt, I617). Blessed art thou,

   Simon Peter,' says our Lord, for flesh and blood have not revealed it
   to thee, but my Father which is in heaven.' St Peter has four names :
   Peter and Barjona and Simon and Cephas. Our Lord says, Blessed (or
   happy) art thou.' Everyone desires happiness. As the philosopher hath
   it. All men desire to be. Hence St Augustine's dictum, The good man
   wants no praise, he wants to be praiseworthy. And our own doctors teach
   withal that virtue is so pure, so wholly abstract and detached from
   corporal things in the ground and summit of its nature that nothing
   what- ever can occur therein without defiling virtue and introducing
   vice. The least thought or suggestion of self-seeking and it is not
   virtue : it is turned to vice. Such is virtue by nature.

   A heathen philosopher says, Virtue, except for virtue's sake, is in uo
   wise a virtue.^ If its object is 'praise or aught else, that is.

   bartering virtue. Genuine virtuJ^s not to be sold for anything on
   earth. Wherefore the good man seeks no praise : he seeks to be
   praiseworthy. It is not the chiding that we ought to mind but the fact
   of deserving to be chidden.

   ^ Blessed art thou,' quoth our Lord. Beatitude lies in four things. To
   have all that has being and is lustily to be desired and brings delight
   ; to have it all at once and whole in the undivided soul and that in
   God, revealed in its perfection, in its flower, where it first burgeons
   forth in the ground of its existence, and all con- ceived where God is
   conceiving himself-- that is happiness. The name Peter means seer of
   God. Now, theologians question whether the kernel of external life lies
   more in intellect or will. Will has two operations : desire and love.
   Intellect, with its simple function, is therefore better ; its work is
   understanding, and it never stops till it gets a naked hold on what it
   sees. Withal it nins ahead of will and tells it what to love. We desire
   a thing while as yet we do not possess it. When we have it we love it :
   desire then falling away.

   What must a man be to see God ? He must be dead. No man can see me and
   live,' said our Lord. Now St Gregory says, That man is dead who is dead
   to the world.' Ye can judge for yourselves how dead one may be and how
   little can touch us the things of this world. By dying to this world we
   do not die to God. St Augustine prayed a variety of prayers. Grant me,
   Lord,' he said, to know both thee and me.' O Lord, have mercy upon me
   and show me thy face and grant me that I die not until I eternally
   behold thee.' This is the first point ; one must be dead to see God. So
   much for the first name, Peter.

   One philosopher says, were there no means we should sec the beloved in
   heaven. But another one says, were there no means we should see
   nothing. Both of them are right. The colour on the wall which is
   carried to my eye is filtered and refined in the air and in the light
   and transmitted in a pure state to my eye. Even so the soul must be
   strained by light and grace before it can see God. So rather is that
   master right who said that without means we should not see at all. But
   the other one is also right who said that without means we should see
   the beloved in heaven. For the soul would see God naked if there were
   nothing between.

   The second name, Barjona, signifies a son of grace, in whom the soul,
   clarified and sublimed, is meet for the vision of God.

   The third name is Simon. That is to say, one who listens, one who
   obeys. To hear God one must be divorced from the world. David says, I
   will be still and listen to what God is saying in me.' He pronounces
   peace in his Word, on his saints, on his people, on all such as commune
   with their heart. Happy the man who is

   busy attending to what God is saying in him. He is directly subject to
   the divine light-ray. The soul that stands with all her powers under
   the light of God is fired and inflamed with divine love. The divine
   light shines straight in from above, and a perpendicular sun on one's
   head is a thing that few can survive. Yet the highest power of the
   soul, her head, is held erect beneath this shaft of godly light so that
   there can shine in this light divine which I have oft described as
   being so bright, so overwhelming, so transcendent, that all lights are
   but darkness in comparison with this light. All creatures, as so being,
   are as naught ; dowsed in the light wherein they get their being they
   are aught. IIow noble soever the natural mind yet to reach, to grasp
   God without means the soul must possess these six qTialifications I
   speak of.

   First, she is dead to changing things. Next, she is well clarified in
   light and grace. Thirdly, she is without means. Fourthly, she hears
   God's Word in her heart. Fifth, she is under the divine light. The
   sixth is the heathen philosopher's definition of happiness : one
   perpetual ascension and vision of beatitude in God. Where the Son
   himself is understanding, in his first leaping forth, there in God's
   highest we too shall understand. Wherefore it behoves us to keep our
   head turned steadfastly that way.

   Cephas means a head. Understanding is the head of the soul. The
   superficial notion is that love stands first. Rut the soundest
   arguments expressly state (what is the truth) that the kernel of
   eternal life lies rather in knowledge than in love. This mark, for our
   best masters say, will no special thing, and lo ! intellect, under-
   standing, this flics straight up to God. Love turns to the loved : she
   finds there what is good. Intellect seizes the cause of the good. Honey
   is sweeter in itself than anything we make from it. Love takes God as
   being sweet, but intellect goes deeper and conceives God as being.
   Blessed art thou, Simon Peter,' quoth our Lord. To the righteous man
   God gives divine being, and calls him by the name which is appropriate
   to that being. Thus he goes on to speak of my Father which is in
   heaven.' Among names none is more appropriate than He-who-is. That one
   should recognise a thing and simply say, it is, would seem absurd ;
   call it a stone, a bit of wood, and we know what that means. But
   suppose every- thing detached, abstracted, pared away, and nothing left
   except the is ; that is the characteristic nature of his name. Our Lord
   promised his disciples, My followers shall sit at my table in my
   Father's kingdom, and shall eat my meat and drink my drink which my
   Father hath prepared for me.' Happy is the wight who has attained to
   receiving with the Son just where the Son receives. Right there we too
   shall find our happiness, and there in

   THE MAN IN THE SOUL

   Vir mens serous tuus mortuus est {4 Reg. 4j_7). The woman said to the
   prophet, My husband thy servant is dead and the creditors are come to
   take my two sons as bondsmen for the debt, for I have nothing but a
   drop of oil.' Then said the prophet, Go borrow empty vessels and pour a
   little in : it will increase and multiply and will pay thy debt and
   release thy sons. Thou and thy children can live on the rest.'

   The spark {i.e. the intellect, the head of the soul), the so-called
   husband of the soul, is none other than a spark of the divine nature, a
   divine light, a ray, an imprint of divinity. A woman begged our Lord
   for the water which he gives. Whoso drinks of this shall never thirst.
   Theologians say, the best gift of God is the Holy Ghost wherein God
   bestows all his grace and favour, his living water, namely. Whom I give
   this to shall never thirst.' This water is grace and light upspringing
   in the soul to everlasting life.

   The woman said, Sir, give me of this water.' And our Lord replied,
   Bring me thine husband.' She said, I have no husband.' Quoth our Lord,
   Tliou hast well said ; thou hast not one, thou hast had five, and he
   whom now thou hast is not thine husband.' St Augustine asks : Why docs
   our Lord reply, " Thou hast well said " ? ' What he means is this : thy
   five senses, these are the five husbands thou hadst in thy youth, after
   thine own heart ; now in thine age thou hast one, not thine own :
   intellect, namely, and this thou dost not obey. When the man in the
   soul, the intellect, is dead, unchecked evil prevails. To separate soul
   and body is bad enough, but for the soul to be divorced from God, that
   is a far worse matter. As the soul is the life of the body so God is
   the life of the soul. As the soul suffuses our members so God suffuses
   the powers of the soul and is passed on by them in goodness and love to
   everything round that they may be aware of him as flowing all the time,
   i.e. above time, in eternity and in the life they live.

   The woman said, Sir, my husband thy servant is dead.' Serous means one
   who receives, receiving another's ; one who keeps and keeps for
   another. To keep for himself would make

   him a thief. Intellect is a servant, more so than will is or love. Will
   and love fall on God as being good : were he not good they would ignore
   him. But intellect pierces right through into essence, reckless of
   goodness, of power, of wisdom, of things accidental whatever they be
   and added to God. Not looking for these she gets them in him when,
   merged into his essence, she knows God simply as existence. What though
   he be not good nor just, yet she enjoys him as pure being. Here
   intellect is like the highest rank of angels of which there are three
   choirs. The Thrones receive God into them and preserve God in
   themselves. In the Cherubim God rests; they sec God continually. The
   Seraphim are ardent (burning) : like to these is the God-bearing
   intellect. With these angels the intellect spies God, in his vestibule,
   naked, as one without difference.

   Quoth the woman, Sir, my husband thy servant is dead, and the creditors
   have come for my two sons.' What arc the two sons of the soul ? St
   Augustine, and with him a heathen doctor, speaks of the two faces of
   the soul. One is turned towards this world and towards the body, in
   this she works virtue and wisdom. The other face gazes straight into
   God ; the divine light is always in it, and this tells upon it unless,
   through being from home, she has it unawares. When the spark of the
   intellect carries right into God, then the man is alive. The birth
   lakes place. Not once a year it happens nor yet once a month nor once a
   day but all the time, beyond time, in the open, where there is neither
   here nor now nor thought nor nature. That is why we speak of sons, not
   daughters.

   Now, to speak of the two sons in another sense. As under- standing and
   will. Understanding leaps out of the intellect first and is afterwards
   followed by will, from them both. But no more of this. -- These two
   sons of intellect may be taken in yet another way. One as power, the
   other as actuality. One heatlicn doctor says that it is in this power
   the soul becomes all things, ideally. In her actuality she is, like the
   Father, making all things new. It pleased God to seal her in the nature
   of all creatures : before the world when she existed not. God wrought
   this whole world ghostly in every single angel before he made the world
   itself. An angel has two understandings. The one is morning light, the
   other is the evening light. In the morning light he sees everything in
   God. In the evening light he sees things in the light of his own
   nature. When he goes out into things it grows night. So long as he
   remains within he has the evening light. We say that the angels rejoice
   when a man becomes good. But, our best doctors ask, do the angels also
   repine when a man commits sin ? We say : No ; they see into the justice
   of God and enjoy all things therein

   as they are in God. Therefore they do not repine. Intellect in its
   potential power is like the angel's natural light, i,e. the evening
   light. With her actual power she raises all things up into God, where
   all things are bathed in the morning light.

   Quoth the woman, The creditors are come to seize my two sons for their
   slaves.' Then said the prophet, Go borrow empty vessels from thy
   neighbours.' These neighbours mean all creatures and the five senses
   and the powers of the soul with her interior faculties which work in
   secret and are angels. From all these neighbours borrow empty vessels.
   Let us borrow empty vessels ; these filled with heavenly wisdom will
   give us means to pay our debt and, on the rest, to live eternally. So
   help us God. Amen.

   THE SOUL SPARK

   Homo quidam fecit coenam magnum {Luc, St Luke relates

   in his gospel how a certain man gave a great supper or evening
   entertainment.' Who makes it ? A certain man. What does he mean by
   calling it a supper ? One master says this betokens great affection,
   seeing none arc bidden save the intimates of God. * When we give a
   morning party all and sundry are invited but to an evening meal wc
   invite important people, the people that we like and our own familiar
   friends.* Secondly, he has in mind how perfect are those souls who
   enjoy this evening meal. The evening never comes without a whole day
   having gone before. Were there no sun there were no day. Sunrise, that
   is morning light which goes on getting brighter up to middle-day. Just
   as the divine light rising in the soul gradually eclipses the powers of
   the soul until the advent of the noon. No day, no spiritual day, at all
   can dawn within the soul except she receive divine light. * Divine
   light breaks into the soul and makes her morning, and the soul mounts
   up in this light into space, to the zenith at high noon.* Thirdly, he
   implies that to take this supper worthily we have to come at evening.
   When the light of this world fails it is the evening. As King David
   sings, He riseth in the evening and His name it is the Lord I ' So
   Jacob at eventide did lay him down to sleep. This betokens peace of
   mind. Fourthly, he remembers, as St Gregory points out, that after
   supper there comes no other meal. * When the spark in the soul takes in
   divine light it needs no other sustenance but keeps ever to this divine
   light.*

   To whom God grants this provender, so fragrant, so delicious, that soul
   shall never relish any other fare.

   St Augustine says, God is of such a nature that once embracing him we
   can never rest elsewhere.' St Augustine says, Lord, so thou take from
   us thyself, grant us then another thee or we shall have no rest ; we
   have no mind for aught but thee.' One holy man says of the God-loving
   soul, that she gets out of God whatsoever she will, befooling him so
   thoroughly he can deny her not a thing there is. He took himself in one
   way and gave himself another way: he took himself God-and-man and gave
   himself God-and- Man, another self in a mystic vessel. Very precious
   hallows arc not wantonly exposed to public gaze and touch. So he clad
   him- self in the frock of the appearance of bread, even as my bodily
   food is altered in my soul, which is not in my nature for an instant
   without combining with it. For there is a power in nature which
   separates the base and throws it out, and the high invades the low to
   the last needle-point and is embodied in it. The things I ate a
   fortnight since are every bit as much united with my soul as what I did
   receive within my mother's womb. Whoso takes this food fasting becomes
   as truly one therewith as flesh and blood arc with my soul.

   There was a certain man ; the man had not a name because this man is
   God.

   The philosopher affirms concerning the first cause that it transcends
   speech. All words fail. Because of the surpassing pureness of its
   nature. We have but three ways of speaking about things : first, in
   terms of things above them ; second, of their likes ; and thirdly, of
   the works of the things. To give you an example. The power of the sun
   draws up the precious sap out of the roots into the shoots and brings
   it out in flower, here the solar power being above it. * As wc say of
   the tree, so we say of the things above the tree ; of the sun, for
   example, which is working in the tree.* Likewise I say the divine light
   is working in the soul. * The spark in the soul being drawn up in this
   light and in the Holy Ghost and borne aloft to its first source. But
   nothing true can be spoken of God, because there is nothing above him.*
   That the soul expresses God does not in anywise affect his real
   intrinsic being : no one can express what he actually is. Some- times
   we say one thing is like another. * We can say nothing of God because
   nothing is like him.* Creatures enclose a mere nothing of God wherefore
   they cannot disclose him. The painter who has painted a good portrait
   therein shows his art : it is not himself that it reveals to us.
   Creatures can no more give out God than they can take in exactly what
   he is.

   who is wordless. According to St Augustine, what we say about God is
   not true and the things that we say not are true. Things we say that
   God is he is not ; what we say he is not that he is rather than what we
   say that he is.

   Who has prepared this repast ? A man, the man who is God. King David
   says, O Lord, how great and manifold is thy enter- tainment, the sweets
   that are laid up for them that love thee ! ' (Not them that fear
   thee.') St Augustine meditating on this food, regarded it with loathing
   and distaste, when lo! he heard a voice from within, I am the food of
   the great, wax and grow great * eating me ; nor ween not that I shall
   be turned into thee : thou shalt be turned into me.* When God works in
   the fiery heat the diverse things within the soul sublime and burn
   away. By the absolute truth ! soul enters more into God than any food
   into us ; nay, the soul is changed into God. There is a power in the
   soul which splits off what is base and is absorbed into God. To wit,
   the spark of the soul. My soul becomes more one with God than food does
   with my soul.

   Who has prepared this evening meal ? A man. Dost know his name ? * Not
   I. His name is not spoken. He is more silence than speech. He is above
   name. What food has he prepared for this feast ? Himself, no less than
   himself.* (What does the servant mean ?) According to St Gregory the
   servant means preachers. And in another sense the servant means the
   angels, *thc angels ever calling us with interior voice.* Thirdly,
   methinks this servant is the spark of the soul, which is sent there by
   God and is his light striking down from above, the reflection (or
   image) of his divine nature and ever opposed to anything ungodly : not
   a power of the soul, as some theologians make it, but a permanent
   tendency to good ; aye, even in hell it is inclined to good. According
   to the masters, this light is of the nature of unceasing effort ; it is
   called syndcresis, that is to say, a joining to and turning from. It
   has two works. One is remorse for imperfection. The other work consists
   in ever more invoking good and bringing it direct into the soul, even
   though she be in hell. It is a great supper. He said to the servant, Go
   out and compel them to come in, those that are bidden, for all things
   are now ready.' All that he is the soul receives. What the soul desires
   is now prepared. The things God gives have always been. Behold them new
   and fresh and all at once in the eternal now.

   A gr^at philosopher declares that anything I see comes into my eyes
   purified and ghostly, and the light that comes into my eyes would never
   get into my soul but for a power above it. * There is a power in sight
   which is superior to the eyes set in the head

   and more far-reaching than the heavens and earth. This power seizes all
   the things that come into the eye^ and bears them up into the soul.* St
   Augustine says the spark comes nigher to the truth than any human
   knowledge, flight burns. They say that one is lighted from another. If
   so, the light is higher than the thing that burns. For instance, take a
   taper, extinguished but still glimmering and smoking, and hold it to
   the light ; this will glance down and light the other. They say one
   fire burns another. But I traverse that. Fire, I ween, does burn
   itself. For one thing to burn another it must needs be above it, like
   heaven, for example, which burns not and is cold ; natheless it sets on
   fire and that by dint of contact with the angels. For this the soul
   prepares by practice. Then she is fired from above. By the angelic
   light. He says to the servant, Go out and say to them that were bidden,
   Come, for all things arc now ready.* Then one said,

   I have bought a piece of ground, I cannot come.' These arc they who
   still have worldly cares ; they never taste this supper. A second said,
   I have bought five yoke of oxen.' These five yoke, I fancy, stand for
   the five senses, for each sense is self and other and the very tongue
   is double. So in my story yesterday, when God said to the woman, Bring
   me thy husband,' she replied,

   I have none.' Whereupon quoth he, Thou sayest truly : thou hast had
   five, and him whom now thou hast is not thine husband.' The moral is
   that those who live the life of the five senses never taste this food.
   The third one said, I have married a wife, therefore 1 cannot come.'
   The soul is all-to single when she turns to God. As glancing down in
   this direction she is woman ; but as seeing God in himself and visiting
   God at home she is the man. Of old it was forbidden to men to dress in
   woman's clothes or women man's. She is man when she penetrates into
   God, impartibly and without means. But when she peers forth at all she
   is woman. * As I have repeatedly said, the man in the soul is the
   intellect. When the soul looks straight up to God with her mind then
   the soul is the man, she is one and not two. But thinking and glancing
   down she dons female dress.* Quoth our liOrd, Verily, these shall not
   taste of my supper ' ; and he commanded the servant, Go out into the
   streets and the lanes, into the highways and hedges -- the narrower the
   wider and hedged about.' * For the more recollected the soul the less
   scattered she is and the more concentrated the wider her ken.* And some
   of her powers arc hedged into one sense. The power I see with I do not
   hear with, nor with my power of hearing can I see. So with the rest (of
   the five senses). But on the other hand, the soul exists entire in
   every member; there is some power, therefore, not confined to place at
   all.

   What is the servant ? Angels and preachers (so says St Gregory). But,

   APPENDIX 1 Synderesis

   Oxford MS.

   The meat and drink I took a fortnight since has turned into my blood,
   my flesh, my nature. That is due to the power of the soul which brings
   it into my nature ; it is as truly one with me as what was born with
   me.

   So does the power of the Holy Ghost take the purest and lightest and
   highest and the spark of the soul and carry it up in the fire of love.
   Just like the sun's power ; this lays hold in the roots of the tree of
   what is most pure and essential, drawing it up into the branches where
   it flowers. Even so is the spark of the soul being always drawn up in
   the light and in the Holy Ghost and conveyed into its source, becoming
   all-to one with God and searching him so throughly that it is more the
   same as God than food is with my life.

   I say it is the light up in the soul where the soul nature

   Mark first in St Andrew his singleness of life and spiritual
   attainments whereby his soul was enabled, in her intellect, to ascend

   For the power of the Holy Ghost seizes the very highest and purest, the
   spark of the soul, and carries it up in the flame of love. Just as the
   power of the sun takes what is purest and subtlest out of the roots of
   the tree and draws it into the branches where it is in flower. Likewise
   the soul-spark is conveyed aloft into its source and is absorbed into
   God and is identified with God and is the spiritual light of God.

   In this light the soul has intercourse with angels and ckc with those
   angels that are fallen into hell. There the spark subsists without any
   kind of suffering, turning straight up into God.

   And withal she is like the good angels in this power, who work
   unceasingly in God, be- holding God in God and return- ing all work
   into God.

   This light the soul carries within her. The masters call it a power in
   the soul, this synderesis. It is not. It means something hanging to God
   and is ever averse from evil.

   In hell it tends to God. It is

   soul at the point where the soul is by nature in contact with the
   angels' nature. The other light is what I speak of. This light pours
   into the soul from on high, above nature.

   Some call it a power of the soul. But it is not. It is called
   synderesis. To wit, the intellect which is a spark (or ray) of God the
   Father given by God out of his Godhead's God- nature, and is the form
   of God without any difference at all. In it she is in touch with the
   angelic nature.

   In this light the soul has community with angels also those cast into
   hell. There the spark is free from all suffering and faces straight up
   into God and has precisely his nature.

   And withal she has a some- what, mind, in common with good angels who
   are constantly working in God and emanat- ing from God and bearing back
   all their work into God and receiving God from God in God.

   The intellect is like to these good angels, drinking God in his eternal
   savour, his living sweetness and in his own ground. She is sent away
   from God and is ' a light that (re)turns : the reflection of the divine
   nature which the soul has cast into her. The masters call it synderesis
   which is as much as to say something suspended from God all the time
   and which never docs wrong.

   In hell, says St Augustine, it

   IF YE THEN BE RISEN WITH CHRIST

   lS'^ consurrexistis cum Christo, qum sursum sunt, qucerite, ubi
   Christus est in dexter a dei sedens etc. (Col. 3|). St Paul says : If
   ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above and set
   not your affections on the things on earth.' Then he goes on to say, ye
   are dead, and your life is hid in Christ with God in heaven.' Thirdly,
   there are the women seeking our Lord at the sepulchre. There they found
   an angel whose countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as
   snow,' and he asked the women, Whom seek ye ? If ye seek Jesus who was
   crucified, he is not here.' For God is not in any place. Of God's
   lowest all creatures are full and his highest is nowhere. They answered
   him not, for they were disappointed at finding the angel and not God.
   God is not here or there, not in time or place.

   St Paul says : If ye be risen w^ith Christ, seek those things that are
   above.' His first word expresses doubt. Some people rise by practising
   one virtue not another. Some, ignoble by nature, covet riches. Others,
   of a noble kind, care nothing for possessions but are bent on honour.
   One master says the virtues all hang upon each other. Though a person
   lean to the uses of one virtue rather than another they stand and fall
   together. Some people rise up all at once and yet rise not with Christ.
   That which is his rises once for all. On the other hand, we do find
   some who rise with Christ for good and all, but it will need a man of
   many parts to know in Christ the true resurrection. The masters say
   that with true resurrection there is no more death. Now there was never
   virtue so outstanding but someone might be found to have acquired it,
   and that by natural means, for natural powers work many signs and
   wonders, all the outward works found in the saints being found

   too in the heathen. And that is why he speaks of being risen with
   Christ,' because he is on high, above the reach of any creature. What
   we have to do is to make the whole ascent.

   There are three signs of our having risen altogether. The first : we
   seek those things that are above. The second : our affections are set
   on the things above. The third : we set not our affections on the
   things that are on earth. St Paul says : Seek those things that are
   above.' But where and in what way ? King David tells us to seek the
   face of God.' What is common to a number must needs come from above.
   Above the lire itself there are the fire-givers like the heavens and
   the sun. Our best doctors teach that heaven is the locus of all things,
   and though it has itself no place, no natural place, yet it makes room
   for all things. My soul is undivided ; also, it is entire in each
   member. Where my eye sees my ear does not hear ; where my ear hears my
   eye sees not. My bodily hearing and sight are engineered in the mind.
   Light gives my eye a sense of colour which is lacking to the soul by
   reason of its being a defect. All the outward senses are alive to, if
   the spirit is to take it in, must be raised up by the angel : he
   imprints it in the upper portion of the soul.

   The above designs and produces the below, so our doctors say. Even so
   St James asserts that Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down
   from above.' One who is risen to the full with Christ is known by his
   seeking for God above time. He seeks God above time who seeks him
   timeless. Seek those things that are above,' he says. Where shall we
   look ? Where Christ is sitting

   on the right hand of his Father.' Where is Christ sitting ? He is
   sitting nowhere ; he is nowhere. If ye seek him anywhere ye shall not
   find him. A master has said that he who sees anything does not see God.
   Now Christ means anointed ; the anointed of the Holy Ghost. Sitting,
   theologians say, symbolises rest and implies timelessness. Turning and
   changing lead nowhere : stop- ping we progress.

   I am God, I change not,' saith the Lord. Christ sitteth on the right
   hand of his Father.' The best gift of God, that is his right hand. With
   natural man, he starts his work with his right hand. Christ says, I am
   the door.' The first outburst and the first effusion God runs out in is
   his fusion into his Son, a process which in turn reduces him to Father.
   I said on one occasion that the door was the Holy Ghost : there he is
   poured out in blessings into all creatures. According to one master,
   the heavens receive from God direct. Another one says. No ; God is
   spirit, pure light, and anything receiving straight from God must
   itself be spirit and pure light. The master denies that it is possible,
   in the first eruption, the first escape of God, that any corporal thing
   should

   take it in : it must be either light or abstract mind. The heavens
   transcend time and are the cause of time. One philosopher maintains
   that the heavens are too lofty in their nature to stoop to be the cause
   of time. It is not in their nature that they are the cause of time : it
   is in their revolution that, timeless, they give rise to time, i.e. in
   the defection of the heavens. My looks are not my nature, they are
   accidents of nature ; our soul is far above them, out of sight in God.
   And hence I say, not only above time but hid in God. That is what
   heaven means. Everything mortal spells deficiency : rise and fall,
   growth and decay. King David sings, A thousand years in God's sight are
   as a day that is past ' : for all the future and the })ast yonder are
   in the now. May we find this now. So help us God. Amen.

   ST DIONYSIUS SPEAKS OF THREE KINDS OF LIGHT

   St Dionysius speaks of three kinds of light the soul has who attains to
   pure knowledge of God. The first is natural, the second ghostly and the
   third divine.

   Now consider what this natural light is and how far it helps her to
   know God. The soul innately knows that existing things are not of
   themselves. But there must be one thing that is of itself and from none
   but itself : whatever that is it created all things.

   Further, the soul innately understands that the good which is scattered
   among things is as a whole in the one cause of things. Also, it is
   natural to the soul to love each thing so far as it is good. And when
   her natural intellect stumbles on the cause of things, whose good,
   broadcast in things, is as a whole in their common cause, then this
   natural perception provokes in her a natural love towards this cause of
   all things.

   All creatures are infirm and changeful, not in reality (which is
   exempt) but in the first stages of perfection. St Augustine says, The
   soul cannot dwell for long upon one thought but lapses from it into
   others. Neither can she entertain several thoughts at once ; she must
   leave one and die to it to quicken in another. But God has no community
   with creatures, wherefore it is evident that there is no deficiency in
   him. He has no community with creatures ; but this applies alone to
   God, and in so far as the soul is like him she is without defect. By
   nature the soul knows and loves God above all things.

   The second light is ghostly ; it originates in faith. But the ' Jostes,
   No. 69.

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS

   whole content of faith is beyond the scope of the nature of the soul.
   The faith is, that three Persons are in the same nature and the same
   nature in three Persons. No natural light or intellect is adequate for
   this, for no natural light affords a likeness of it. What the three
   Persons do, or are capable of doing, is the product of their unity ;
   for though there are three Persons they do not act as three but they
   function as one God. That is a ghostly light whereby the soul in faith
   can actually see that this is so, (a light) such as her natural mind
   could never give her.

   The third light is the light of glory, divine light. This the soul
   receives into the chief power of the soul. In this light we see God
   with nothing between. So far as this light sinks into her chief power
   so far is God immediately perceived. In this light the soul divines the
   noble nature of all things in God, for all that ever issued forth or is
   issuing forth or ever shall, has in God eternal life and being ; not
   defective as it is in creatures but as his very being for it is his
   nature. God has his own being not from naught, he has it of his proper
   nature which in itself is truly aught though naught to the intelligence
   of creature.

   This nature is causeless, therefore it is unfathomable except to
   causeless understanding. Creaturely intelligence is finite, so it has a
   cause ; hence it cannot fathom causeless mind, not Christ nor his
   humanity. Where God is beholding his own nature, which is groundless,
   it is incomprehensible except to groundless understanding. This
   understanding is none other than his nature is itself : only God in his
   own nature can conceive himself. This conception is the understanding
   wherein, self- revealed, God manifests in light that no man can attain
   to. As St Paul says, God dwells in light unapproachable.'

   STAND IN THE GATE

   Dominus (licit : sta in porta domus dornini et prcedica verhum istud
   (Jer. Tg). The Lord says, Stand in the gate of God's house and proclaim
   his word, extol his word.' The heavenly Eather speaks one Word and that
   he speaks eternally and in this Word expends he all his might : his
   entire God-nature he utters in this Word and the whole of creatures.
   This Word lies hidden in the soul unnoticed and beyond our ken, and
   were it not for rumours in the ground of hearing we should never heed
   it ; but all sounds and voices have to cease and silence, perfect
   stillness, reign. This is a meaning I will not pursue.

   Stand in the gate. Who stands there, his limbs are orderly

   disposed. lie is about to speak ; the head of the soul is held stiffly
   up. The ordered is subject to an order which is higher than itself.
   Creatures are not of the order of God till the soul's natural light,
   wherein they get their being, overshadows them, and the angelic light
   overshadows the light of the soul preparing and adapting it for divine
   light to work in ; for God works not in corporal things, he works in
   the eternal. That is why the soul must be recollected and integrated to
   the spirit. It is there God works and there all works are agreeable to
   God. Never a thing is to God's liking unless it is wrought there.

   Stand in the gate in the house of God, that is, his unity of essence.
   One is best kept by itself. So the unity stands by God and keeps God
   together, adding nothing. There he sits in his own presence, in his is
   -ness, all in himself, nowhere out of himself. But as he melts he runs
   out. He melts and runs out in his good- ness which, as I have
   explained, consists of knowledge and love. Knowledge is the flux, for
   knowledge is hotter than love. But two are better than one. And this
   knowledge is laden with love. Love is fooled and caught by kindness ;
   in love I hang about the gate turning a blind eye to the authentic
   vision. Even stones have love, a love that seeks the ground. If I
   insist on goodness in the first effusion and seize this at the point
   where it is good, then I shall seize the gate, not God himself.
   Knowledge is the better, as being the head and front of love. Love is
   the will to, the intention. No single thought attaches to this know-
   ledge : wholly detached and self-forsaken it runs all bare into the
   arms of God and grasps him in himself.

   Lord it is meet that thy house be holy and a house of prayer. What is
   prayer ? It is the practice of pure being and glorying therein. What is
   the glory ? The arraying of man in the likeness of God in him. But
   while any image exists in the soul there is no glorifying God therein,
   as in a prayer-house, in the length of days. I do not mean days here :
   when I say length without length that means the length ; breadth
   without breadth means the breadth. When I speak of all time I mean
   above time and above it, as I have explained, there is no here or now.

   The woman asked our Lord when we ought to pray. Our Lord replied, The
   hour cometh but not yet, when true worshippers shall worship in spirit
   and in truth.' For God is a spirit and they must worship in spirit and
   in truth that which is truth itself. Which we are not ; true we may be,
   but there is false mixed with it. For ye do not exist in God in that
   first eruption where truth comes spouting from its source. In the gate
   of God's house the soul has to stand and trumpet forth his Word-
   Everything which is in the soul has to utter praise, standing,

   deaf to all the world, in silence and in peace, as I described the
   angels as sitting there with God. In that choir of wisdom and of
   burning God on a sudden declares himself to the soul plighting her his
   troth for good and all. It is the Father begetting his Son and in his
   Word he takes such huge delight, so fond he is of it, that he never
   stops but goes on pledging his Word the whole time : timelessly, that
   is to say. And here we must observe that the house God plights his
   troth in is deserted : bare spirit, above time. Meet for thine house
   are holiness and praise, there must be nothing there that does not
   praise thee.

   Our theologians ask, what praises God ? Likeness does. Any likeness to
   God that lives in the soul redounds to the glory of God. Things at all
   different from God do not glorify God. A portrait, for example,
   reflects credit on the painter who embodies in it his dearest
   conception of his art and makes it the image of himself. The likeness
   of the portrait praises the author without words. Of little worth is
   spoken praise or praying with the lips. Our Lord said on one occasion,
   Ye pray, not knowing what prayer is. There shall come again true
   prayers, praying to my Father not in words but in spirit and in tnith.*
   What is prayer ? Dionysius says, The mind's ascent to God, that is what
   prayer means.' It is a heathen who observes that where spirit is and
   unity and eternity there God will be at work. Where flesh is warring
   against spirit ; where disruption is warring against union ; where time
   is warring with eternity, there God works not : he can do nothing with
   it. Further, any pleasure we may have, or contentment or comfort, has
   to go. To worship God she must be holy, summed up to a whole, one
   spirit naught beside : all wrought up at once into the eternal eternity
   on high, transcending all. Not all creatures which have been created,
   it is not them I mean, but all he could do an he would. This soul must
   transcend. While there is anything above the soul ; while there is
   anything in front of and in God, she can never enter his ground in the
   length of days.

   Now, according to St Augustine, when the light of the soul eclipses
   creatures, it is dawn ; when the angelic light eclipses the light of
   the soul and devours it, then it is broad day. David says, The
   righteous man mounts up and up to the perfect day.' His path is fair
   and smooth and pleasant and familiar. And when the psychic and angelic
   lights are swallowed up in the light divine, he calls that high noon.
   Now day is at its longest, in its prime, when the sun at its zenith
   pours its light into the stars and the stars pour it into the moon.
   These are members of the solar system. And even so the light of God
   embraces the angelic light and that of the soul, an orderly array, an
   ascending scale steadily rising in the day, all praising God in chorus.

   YOUNG MAN, ARISE!

   Adolescens, tibi dico : surge {Luc, 7^^), Our Lord went to a city
   called Naim, and many of his disciples went with him and much people.
   And when they came under the gate there was a dead man carried out, a
   youth, the only son of a widow. And our Lord came and touched the bier
   whereon the body lay, and said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise ! '
   The life spake life into the dead. The youth arose and straightway took
   up his parable : his resurrection by the eternal Word.

   He went to a city. I say, that means the soul which is well ordered and
   fortified in the Holy Ghost and, having set a watch for sin and shut
   out multiplicity, is safe and sound in Jesus : en- compassed and walled
   round by the light of God. As the prophet hath it, God is the wall
   round Zion.' The eternal wisdom says, In the holy and in the sanctified
   city I shall have like repose.' Nothing is so restful, so unifying, as
   like ; hence same and in and near and by. That soul is holy in whom is
   God alone and wherein no creature finds rest. He says, I shall have
   like repose in the holy and in the sanctified city.' All sanctity is of
   the Holy Ghost. This nature nothing transcends : beginning with the
   lowest it works it up into the highest. Philosophers say air only turns
   to fire when it is rarefied and hot. The Holy Ghost seizes the soul and
   clarifying her in its light and grace draws her up to the supreme. He
   says, In the sanctified city I shall alike repose.' As the soul rests
   in God so God reposes fn her. If she rests partly in him then he rests
   partly in her ; if she rests wholly in him he rests wholly in her. That
   is why the eternal wisdom says, I shall repose alike (or equally).'

   According to philosophers, the green and yellow colours of the rainbow
   merge into one another too gradually for any eye to follow, however
   keen its sight. And nature works so gradually when it resolves itself
   into the first effusion, this is so homogeneous with the angels, that
   Moses durst not write thereof for fear of the faint- hearted, lest they
   should worship them : so much the same they are with the first
   emanation. One high authority definitely states that the topmost angel
   is so nigh the first eruption, he has in him so much of God's likeness
   and God's might, that he it is who cares

   for and looks, after this whole world as well as all the angels who are
   under him. The moral of which is, that God the high, the pure, and the
   impartible is operative in his highest creature who exerts his power,
   as a viceroy rules the land in the name of the king. He says, In the
   holy and in the sanctified city alike do I repose.'

   As I was saying lately, the gate or door that, melting, God flows out
   by, is goodness. Essence is self-absorbed : not an effusion but an
   inner fusion. And unity is one and self-contained : aloof from
   everything and free from outside intercourse. But goodness is the
   melting and running out of God : his diffusion to the whole of
   creatures. Essence is the Father, unity the Son, and goodness is the
   Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost seizes the soul (the sanctified city) at its
   purest, at its highest, and hales it up into its first source, which is
   the Son, and the Son bears it on into his source, his Father namely,
   into the ground, into the first, where the Son has his being ; where
   the eternal wisdom is in like repose in the holy and in the sanctified
   city, in the innermost.

   He says our Lord went to a city called Naim.' Naim means son of a dove,
   which suggests simplicity. The soul shall never rest in her potential
   power (or nature) till she is simplified to God. It also signifies a
   flow of water and implies passivity of soul towards sin and
   imperfection. The disciples symbolise the divine light which shall flow
   in and flood the soul. The much people ' are the virtues whereof I
   lately spoke. The soul shall ascend in fiery aspiration and pass above
   the manifold merit of the angels to the greater virtues. So she comes
   under the gate ' and enters into love and unity : the gate whence they
   bore out the youth, the widow's son. Our Lord came and touched the bier
   whereon the body lay.' How he came and how he touched I will not dwell
   upon but upon the words, Young man. Arise ! '

   He was the son of a widow : her man was dead. Ilcncc dead too was her
   son, the only son of the soul, the will and all the powers of the soul,
   for all these are one in the innermost mind, and mind {ix, intellect)
   is the man in the soul. Her husband was dead, therefore her son was
   dead also. Young man, I say unto thee. Arise ! ' When the Word
   addresses the soul and the soul replies in the living Word, then the
   Son is alive in the soul.

   Philosophers ask which is the better, the power of plants or the power
   of words or the power of stones ? Let us consider. Words derive their
   power from the original Word. But the abuse and multiplication of words
   impairs their force. Plants possess great power. I have heard that a
   serpent was fighting with a weasel when the weasel ran off and fetched
   a little plant which, wrapping in another plant, it launched upon the
   serpent and, breaking asunder, the serpent lay dead. What endowed the

   weasel with this wisdom ? The virtue of plant-lore. Therein lies much
   wisdom. Words, too, have prodigious power: with words we can do
   wonders. And stones again are very potent in virtue of the likeness
   wrought in them by the starry and celestial force. Like works in like
   most mightily, and that is why the soul, by raising herself up in the
   natural light, can get into angelic light and in the angelic light
   enter the light divine and so stand in the three lights, at the
   cross-ways, at the vertex, where the lights run into one. There the
   eternal Word is saying life in her, and there the soul is living and
   gainsaying in the Word. So may we be gainsay ers in the eternal Word,
   God helping us. Amen.

   YOUNG MAN, ARISE!

   AdolescenSj tibi dico : surge (Luc, 7^^), We read in the gospel that a
   woman came to our Lord Jesus Christ. She said, Sir, I am a widow, and
   had an only son who is dead.' Our Lord said, Young man, Arise ! '

   The widow, this woman whose husband was dead, and her only son. By this
   woman is meant the understanding, her husband is the man of the soul,
   and the youth the highest intelleet, for that is the young man. When
   the soul is dead in imperfection, the higher mind awakening into
   understanding cries to God for grace. Then God gives it divine light
   and it becomes self-knowing. Therein it sees God. I said, intellect
   alone can receive divine light. The other powers of the soul are
   instruments and agents for raising the intellect to its maximum
   lucidity.

   It is a question with the theologians, which ranks higher, under-
   standing or love ? One school says understanding, the other school,
   love. It is a lively subject of debate. Understanding says : How canst
   thou love a thing thou dost not know ? Love says : What avails thee thy
   knowledge without love ? Loveless, thou shalt never find eternal
   happiness. Understanding says : I am born in the clear light of
   self-knowledge. Love says : Great knowledge without love is vain.
   Understanding says : Give place, thou are only my slave : thou dost
   help me to rise and remainest. Love says : I am the good that God is
   himself. Knowledge says ; High is thy claim : without me thou dost fall
   to the ground. Love says : It would be well for thee to bear me more in
   mind. Understanding says : I can rise higher not fettered to thee ; my
   vision is clearer, nay, I want none of thee. I have what I will the
   while I know what hitherto I have descried and into which I now have
   flowed to abide for aye in perfect

   things direct from God, and says : I have conceived the sovran good
   wherein is naught save unity. Intuition says ; I shall cleave to thee,
   iny place is at thy side. Intellect says : Knowledge and love must
   remain behind. Intui- tion says : It is meet I should enjoy what I have
   divined. Highest intellect replies : What you have brought me to and
   which I hitherto have known, now knows itself in me. Wherefore I find I
   need none else. All created things must remain behind with all I ever
   was. I stand before my cause.

   To go back to the widow and our Lord's command, Young man, Arise ! ' we
   must bear in mind that anything not far from birth is young. Thus it is
   with intellect as standing in the presence of its cause ; oblivious of
   the aids to its ascent it fondly weens it has been there for aye and
   there shall eternally remain. That may not be.

   Then take the words : by the widow is meant the understand- by her son
   the intellect, and by her husband the man of the soul.' Now you must
   know, when the man of the soul begins to rise, the masters say it is
   another man. By which you must not understand it is another soul : it
   is another being of the soul ; the old mode is done, it is dead. The
   soul assuming her real mode stands in her virgin innocence. The man of
   the soul, transcending his angelic mode and guided by the intellect,
   pierces to the source whence flowed the soul. Intellect itself is left
   outside with all named things. So the soul is merged into pure unity.
   This we call the man of the soul, and, having reached this
   consummation, he has no need of any help. What he did here- tofore God
   now does in him. God knows him as he knew him, God loves him as he
   loved him. God is doing all the work and the man of the soul is
   absolutely idle.

   When a man has reached this point we may well say, this man is God and
   man. All Christ has by nature he has won by grace. His body is filled
   with the noble nature of the soul, which she receives from God, with
   divine light, wherefore we may truly ery, Behold, a man divine ! Pity
   them, my children, they are from home and no one knows them. Let those
   in quest of God be careful lest appearances deceive them in these
   people who are peculiar and hard to place ; no one rightly knows them
   but those in whom the

   same light shines. Namely, the light of truth. Yet it may well be that
   wayfarers to that same good, but who have not yet reached it, will come
   across these perfect of whom we have been speaking. Believe me, did I
   know one such, and had a convent-full of gold and precious stones, I
   would give the whole of it for a single fowl for him to eat. Further I
   declare, if all the things God ever made were mine, I would for with
   give them all for the enjoyment of that man, and rightly, for they are
   all his. Nay, more I say : his, too, is God in the fullness of his
   power, and if there stood before me all who in imperfection arc
   anhungered, I would not withhold from that man's need a single feather
   of the fowl, though I might feed that multitude. For, you must
   remember, with one in imperfec- tion, anything he eats or drinks will
   drag him down and make him prone to sin. But not the virtuous man :
   what he eats and drinks he raises up in Christ to the Father. So look
   well to yourselves.

   You are familiar with Christ's words, Where two arc gathered together
   in my name I will be with them.' Here Christ is referring to the
   harmonious union of the body and the soul, where body wants nothing
   except what the soul wills. God is with these : they are the people we
   have been speaking of. Here the man of the soul is in actual possession
   of his eternal happiness, and, being docked of all her powers, the soul
   encounters no sort of opposition. I warn you, you must keep a sharp
   look out, for they arc difficult to tell ; thus if they should need it,
   while other people fast they will be eating, while other people watch
   they will be sleeping, while other folks are pra&gt; ing they will hold
   their peace. In short, the things they say and do seem imaeeountable,
   for what God makes obvious to persons on the way to their eternal
   happiness is foreign to those that have arrived there. These have no
   wants whatever : they arc rich in the possession of a city of their
   own. I call that my own which is mine eternally and no one can take
   from me. These people, you must know, do most valuable work. They work
   within, you understand, in the man of the soul. Blessed is the kingdom
   wherein dwells one of them ; in an instant they will do more lasting
   good than all the outward actions ever done. See ye withhold not aught
   of theirs. May we recognise these people and loving God in them, with
   them possess the city they have won. So help us God. Amen.

   the week, at evening, when the doors were shut, came our Lord and stood
   in the midst of the disciples and said : Peace be unto you ! ' and
   again, Peace be unto you ! ' and a third time,

   Receive ye the Holy Ghost ! ' Now the evening never comes unless
   morning and midday have gone before. We say that the middle of the day
   is warmer than the evening. But in so far as evening takes in
   middle-day and stores up its heat, it is the warmer, when, too, before
   the evening there goes a whole bright day. Late in the year, again,
   after the summer solstice, when the sun is drawing nigh to earth, the
   evenings will grow warm. But midday never comes till morning goes nor
   evening until noon has passed away. The moral of which is, that when
   the divine light breaks forth in the soul, getting brighter and
   brighter unto the perfect day, then morning does not vanish before noon
   nor noon ere eventide : they close up to one. So the evening is warm.
   There is perfect day in the soul when all the soul is full of light
   divine. But it is evening in the soul, as I have said before, when the
   light of this world fades and the soul goes in to rest.

   God said, Peace ! ' and Peace 1 ' again, and Receive ye the Holy Ghost
   ! ' Jacob the patriarch came to a place, in the evening, and putting
   underneath his head some stones which lay about, he sank to rest. In
   his sleep he saw a ladder reaching up to heaven with angels ascending
   and descending and God leaning down over the top of the ladder. This
   place Jacob slept in had no name. Which is as much as to say : the God-
   head alone is the place of the soul, and is nameless. Concerning this
   our doctors say : a thing which is another's place must be above it ;
   as heaven is the place of all things and fire is the place of air and
   air the place of water and water, partially, the place of earth and
   earth is not a place. An angel is a heavenly place, and any angel who
   has got the least drop more of God than any other is the place, the
   habitation, of that other, the most exalted angel being the place, the
   room, the measure of the rest while he himself is without measure. But
   although he is without measure, natheless God is his measure.

   Jacob rested in the place which is nameless. By not naming it it is
   named. On getting to this nameless place the soul will rest : where all
   things are being God in God, there shall she rest. The abode of the
   soul, which God is, is unnamed. I say, God is unspoken. But St
   Augustine says that God is not unspoken ; were he unspoken, that even
   would be speech and he is more silence than speech. One of our most
   ancient philosophers who found the truth long, long before God's birth,
   ere ever there was Christian faith at all as it is now, to him (I say)
   it seemed that what he could manage to utter of things only conjured up
   within him

   something monstrous and unreal and therefore he refused to speak at
   all. Not even would he say, give me meat or give me drink. He declined
   to mention things because he could not say them as perfect as they
   sprang from their first cause : he chose rather to be dumb and to make
   known his wants by pointing with his finger. How much more does it
   beseem us, if he knew not the way to talk of things, to be absolutely
   mute concerning him who is the origin of all things.

   We say that God is a spirit. Not so. If God were really a spirit he
   would be spoken. According to St Gregory, we cannot rightly speak of
   God at all. Anything we say of him is bound to be a stammering. This
   place which is not named, wherein all creatures thrive and bloom in
   orderly array, this habitat of all creatures, is gotten suddenly out of
   the ground of this orderly place, the seat of the soul proceeding out
   of this ground.

   Jacob wanted to rest : mark you, he wanted to rest. Whoso resteth in
   God his rest is will-free. We say that will is without habit. Will is
   free, it takes nothing from matter. In this sense it is freer than
   intellect, and some rash people pouncing upon this would put it above
   knowledge. That is not so. Intellect also is free despite that
   intellect does take from matter and from corporal things in the
   locality of soul, for, as 1 pointed out on Easter Eve, various of the
   soul-powers are in link with the five senses, for in- stance, sight and
   hearing, which convey to them the things we know. A master says : God
   would never choose that eye or ear should sense what crowns the summit
   of the soul : none other than the nameless place, which is the place of
   all things.' It gives a fair reflection, and is useful in that way, but
   is marred by colour and by sound and corporal things. It is only by the
   senses that the soul is roused and the idea of wisdom naturally
   imprinted in her. Plato says, and with him St Augustine : The soul has
   all know- ledge within, and all wc can do from without is but an
   awakening of knowledge. -- Jacob rested in the evening. Let us pray
   ever for the now ; 'tis but a little thing wc ask, just for one
   evening. May it be granted us, So help us God. Amen.

   EVERY GOOD GIFT

   Omne datum optimum et omne donum perfectum descendit a patre luminum
   {Jac. Ij^). My Latin quotation is from the Epistle of St James. He
   says, Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above from
   the Father of lights. With him is no variableness nor shadow of time
   (or, temporal

   reflection).' These two terms he uses, good gift and perfect gift,
   refer to different things, so our masters say. Datum befalls in time ;
   donum has no thought of time. Datum is a matter of self-seeking, but
   donum is free and unconditioned and wholly without why. A perfect gift
   is one betokening nothing but good- will. The perfect gift is therefore
   free and unconditional. The perfect gift is a friendly offering,
   essentially a giving albeit not bestowed. According to our masters,
   gifts are perfect in so far as they are love-bearers ; but good gifts
   are like hucksters and have ever their price. In the words of one of
   the saints, Blood of the Holy Ghost and its glow is in one sense
   eternal and in another temporal.' If my face were eternal and were held
   before a mirror it would be received in the mirror as a temporal thing
   albeit eternal in itself. The Holy Ghost has its glow. The eternal glow
   of his eternal blood is the perfect gift ; when the soul is worthy and
   receives the same it turns to the good gift. Meaning to say that this
   gift which is temporal in us is in itself eternal. God would give us
   not only his good gift ; he is ready to bestow on us his perfect gift
   as well, to wit, the Holy Ghost itself. Hence his words, Every good
   gift and every perfect gift comes down from above from the Father of
   lights.'

   From another point of view he means, so it appears to me, that the Holy
   Ghost is the perfect gift only as working in the intellect. As
   proceeding forth in the practice of good works, albeit godly, or withal
   in thought, it becomes good gift. It is the perfect gift so far as the
   soul is living in God, immanent in the light and savour of God, hanging
   motionless in his perfect light-nature. As St Paul says, Ye shall taste
   the things that are above.' The Holy Ghost is the Gift wherein ye abide
   in the perfection of light. The soul suspended in pure intellectual
   light is enjoying the things that are above. Our masters teach that
   corporeal things arc called matter. We say, the light of intellect
   shuns matter, but albeit in itself wholly devoid of things it still has
   potentiality and that for matter. He says, Taste the things that are
   above,' not, that arc above the earth. We have a saying. So far from
   matter so far pure intelligence. When in the light the grey tint of the
   cloth assails my eye, I see it. If it were intellect I should see
   nothing. We recognise another power as being far removed from matter.
   How so? Suppose I saw a man twenty years ago, he may now be dead, but
   still I have a likeness of his form as though he stood before my eyes.
   This power needs no matter, but it has the imperfection of receiving
   from matter~in forms, that is to say. On the other hand, the light,
   intelligence, transcends what is already matter or is so potentially.
   While the soul abides in God, suspended in his

   intellectual light she has no material objectivity nor likeness nor
   potentiality. He says, Every good gift and every perfect gift comes
   down from above from the Father of lights.'

   What docs he mean by calling it good gift ? ' Betwixt those things
   whose being-and-doing is in eternity and the things whose being and
   doing are in time there needs must be some middle term. He means that
   it is God, this thing whose being-and-doing is the perfect gift ; so
   the being-and-doing of the perfect gift is in eternity. But the
   being-and-doing of the good gift are in time ; which of course must
   mean that the soul is on the way to eternal life. Why does he promise
   both good and perfect gifts ? When God bestows the Holy Ghost itself,
   whose being-and-activity is in eternity, that is his perfect gift
   which, peering forth in thought, is his good gift.

   St Augustine says, and the masters too, the soul has some capacity
   which is open towards God and into which he alone can speak, whereas
   creature speaks into another. Into this highest power, which is
   addressed by God alone, he utters wisdom, which is his perfect gift.
   But the other one that creature speaks to is satisfied with reason. The
   same gift is perfect, being timeless, and good as perfecting the things
   of time. What is temporal in us is eternal in God. Datum in us is donum
   in God. What is mixed and temporal and good in us becomes, if we follow
   it up, perfect in God. What we are able to receive of him is infinitely
   small compared to what he is. Whatever else one may know one docs not
   know God.

   He says, he comes down from on high from the Father of lights.' What
   docs he mean ? The Son and the Holy Ghost have one source in the
   Father, and the Holy Ghost and the Son arc one light and they arc both
   of them lights. God is the Father of lights. St Augustine tells what
   the soul is tasting in God. He explains that in that food the tongue is
   savouring the invisible light ; he says the soul is not a thing of
   sensible appetites and pleasures ; she has a hidden energy and
   luminosity.

   According to the masters, the angels are a light : God is the entire
   light, with whom is no change nor time nor turning. The nobler the
   creature the more akin to God. All creaturely being- and-doing is in
   time. But the angels, who are higher, are in essence timeless and
   without alteration in themselves. Their wonted activities in God are
   free from time, but in that they look down they have an aspect (or
   shadow) of time. But in none of his works has God any shadow of time
   nor of change. So far as there is no changing, no shadow in man, so far
   he compares with divinity. Creature has ever this and that, one thing
   and another ; but in God exists neither this nor that, neither one nor
   tother;

   EVERY GOOD GIFT

   Omne datum optimum et omne donum perfectum de sursum est descendens a
   patre luminum {Jac. l^^). St James says in his epistle, Every good gift
   and every perfect gift cometh down from above from the Father of
   lights.'

   Now yc must know that people who resign themselves to God and
   diligently seek to do his will, to these, I say, whatever God may send
   will be the best. As God lives, be sure it is the very best, and there
   can be no better way. Some other may seem better yet is not so good for
   thee; God wills this way and not that, therefore this way is bound to
   be the best. Sickness or poverty, hunger or thirst, what God does give
   thee or what he does not, that is the very best for thee, aye, though
   it be fervour or the interior life which, alas ! thou dost lack.
   Whatever thou hast or hast not, accept it all to the glory of God, and
   then whatever he sends thee will be for the best.

   Peradventure thou wilt say. How can I tell whether it is God's will or
   not ? If it were not God's will it would not be. Neither sickness nor
   anything else dost thou have excepting God wills. And therefore knowing
   it to be God's will thou oughtest to rejoice in it and to be so content
   therewith that any pain shall lose its sting for thee ; aye, even in
   extremity of pain to feel the least affliction or distress were
   altogether wrong : accept it from God as the best since it is bound to
   be the best thing for thee. It is of the essence of him to will what is
   best. Let me then will it too ; there is nothing that should please me
   better. Supposing there was someone I tried hard to please and whom I
   knew for certain liked me in a grey coat more than any other ;
   doubtless that coat would please me too, and I should prefer it to any
   of the rest however nice they were. Given then my wish to please a
   certain person, the things I know he wishes both of word and deed are
   the things that I would do and those alone. Judge for yourselves then
   of your love ! If ye do indeed love God ye will Uke nothing better than
   that which best enables him to work his will in us. However great may
   seem the pain or the privation.

   108 MEISTER ECKHART

   except thou take deliglit therein as great as in thine ease and plenty,
   it is wrong.

   One thing I am wont to say, and it is the fact, that daily we cry in
   our pater noster^ Lord, thy will be done ! and when his will is done we
   grumble and are discontented at it. Whatever he does let us deem that
   the best and like that best of all. Those who do take it as the best
   always remain tranquil. Sometimes ye will say, Alas ! 'twere better
   something else had happened, or, had that not been, things would have
   turned out better. As long as thou dost think so thou wilt never be at
   peace. Accept it all for the best. That is the first moral of our text.

   There is another meaning, mark it well. He says every gift.' The very
   best and the very highest, these are innate gifts and in him the most
   innate of all. God gives nothing so gladly as great gifts. Once in this
   very place I said, God likes forgiving big sins more than small ones.
   The bigger they arc the gladder he is and the quicker to forgive them.
   It is the same with graces, gifts, and virtues : the greater they arc
   the greater his pleasure in bestowing them, for the giving of largesse
   is his nature. The bigger the things and the better the more shall ye
   get. [The noblest creatures are the angels who are minds and nothing
   else ; they have no carnal nature and they are in number infinitely
   more than all the corporal things.]

   Once upon a time I laid it down that to be properly expressed a thing
   must proceed from within, moved by its form : it must come, not in from
   without but out from within. It really lives in the recesses of the
   soul. There all things arc present to thee, subjectively alive and
   active in their zenith, in their prime. Why art thou unaware of it ?
   Because thou art not at home. The more noble a thing the more common it
   is. Feeling I have in common with the beasts and life in common with
   the trees. Being is still more innate in me and that I have in common
   with all creatures. Heaven exceeds all neighbouring things, and it is
   nobler also. The nobler the thing the bigger it is and the more
   universal. Love is as noble as it is universal. It does indeed seem
   hard, as our Lord commands, to love our evenchristians as ourselves.
   The unenlightened say that we ought to love them just the same as they
   love themselves. Not so. We ought to love them no more than our own
   selves, which is not difficult. If you come to consider, it is matter
   for reward more than a behest. The command seems hard but the reward
   desirable. He who loves God as he ought and must (whether he would or
   not), and as all creatures love him, will love his evenchristian as
   himself, rejoicing in his joys and hoping for his honour as much as for
   his own and treating the other like himself. By this means he is always
   happy

   whether in honour or in need, just as though he were in heaven and
   withal has more enjoyments than the blessings of himself alone.

   The plain truth is that it is wrong for thee to hold thine honour
   dearer than another's. Remember, an thou seekest aught of thine thou
   never shalt find God, for thou art not seeking God merely. Thou art
   seeking for something with God, making a candle of God, as it were,
   with which to find something, and then, having found it, throwing the
   candle away. Thus shalt thou fare : aught that thou findest with God is
   naught, whatsoever it be, whether profit or wages or the interior life
   or anything else : naught dost thou seek and naught shalt thou find.
   Thou shalt find naught because it is naught thou dost seek ; that is
   all. All creatures are a mere naught. I say not they are small, are
   aught : they are absolutely naught. A thing without being is not (or is
   naught). Creatures have no real being, for their being consists in the
   presence of God. If God turned away for an instant they would all
   perish. I have sometimes said, and it is true, that he who has gotten
   the whole world plus God has gotten no more than God by himself. Having
   all creatures without God is no more than having one fly without God ;
   just the same, no more nor less.

   This is a true saying. The man who gives a thousand marks of gold for
   the making of convents or of churches is doing a great deed. But that
   man gives a great deal more who gives a thousand marks for naught ; he
   is doing far more than the other. When God created all creatures he
   could not move in them, they were so small and narrow. But the soul he
   made so like himself, so nearly his own peer, on purpose to give
   himself to her : nothing else that he could give her would she care for
   in the least. God must give me himself for my own as he is his own, or
   I shall get naught, nor is aught else to my taste. Whoso receives him
   thus outright must wholly have renounced himself and gone out of
   himself; he gets straight from God all that he has, as his own just as
   much as it is his, and our Lady and all the habitants of heaven. All
   this is meet and proper to this man. Those who have renounced
   themselves and are in this ' sense dead unto themselves receive the
   same, no less.

   Thirdly, the term Father of lights.' The word father implies to us a
   son. Father stands for abstract generation, and is an expression for
   the universal principle of life. The Father generates his Son in his
   eternal intellect and the Father generates his Son in the soul just as
   he does in, his own nature ; he bears his Son in \ the soul as her own,
   and his existence depends on his bringing his Son to birth in the soul,
   whether he would or no. On one occasion '

   MEISTER ECKHART

   I was asked what the Father is doing in heaven ? I said, He is
   begetting his Son, an act he so delights in and which pleases him so
   well that he does nothing else but generate his Son» and these .? twain
   are flowering with the Holy Ghost. When the Father gives birth to his
   Son in me I am his very Son and not another : we are another in
   manhood, true, but there I am the Son himself and no other. As sons we
   are lawful heirs. He who knows the truth wots this right well. The word
   father connotes just be- getting and having of sons. We are sons in his
   Son and are the Son himself.

   Now consider the words, they come from above.' I said, referring to
   this very thing. Whoso desires to receive from above must needs be
   below in true humility. Know in good sooth, if a thing is not right
   underneath it receives nothing nor conceives nothing : not a single
   thing however small. Hast thou an eye to thine own self or to any thing
   or person, then thou art not right under and thou receivest nothing ;
   but being brought right under thou receivest all at once and in
   perfection. It is God's nature to give, and his existence depends on
   his giving to us when we are under. If we are not, then we get nothing
   : we do him violence and kill him. Or if unable so to do to him, we do
   it to ourselves as far as in us lies. If thou wouldst really give him
   all, see to it thou dost put thyself right humbly under God, raising up
   God in thy heart and in thy understanding. The Father sent his son into
   the world in the fullness of time of the soul, when she had finished
   with time. Wheii the soul is free from time and place the Father sends
   his Son mto the soul. This is the explanation of the words, the best
   gifts come from above from the Father of lights.' Let us be ready to
   receive these same best gifts. So help ? i us God the Father of lights.

   ignorant and did not understand. They were sa3ring to each other, We
   know not what he means.' So St John relates, and he was there. Follows
   a parable which I will not dwell on. Then, knowing what was in their
   hearts he says quite plainly, I shall see you again and your joy shall
   be full.'

   Now, to my mind this saying will bear four interpretations.

   More or less the same in wording but widely different in meaning. The
   kernel of the prime conception and of eternal happiness is knowledge.
   One theologist who spoke at Paris insisted with loud fulminations that
   this is not so. Then up and said another one, better than the best they
   have at Paris : Sir, you are very positive, but in the gospel did not
   God declare the very thing that you denounce so roundly ? Our Lord's
   words are, This is eternal life, to know thee the only true God ' -- A
   little and ye shall see me.' Meaning to say, ye must get to look upon
   everything in you as little and of small account if ye are ever to see
   God. It follows that we must observe minutely what will help and hinder
   divine knowledge. However small what comes from God, if treated rightly
   it recurs, it comes again, for we have one divine thing of our own that
   we can work with as with our own soul ; not that I work and God looks
   on : I, as it were, co-operate with my own tool which is mine and in
   me. Thus man being lifted up in time shall sec God out of himself. I
   have sometimes said, the time St Paul saw nothing he saw God. Now I say
   something better : when St Paul saw all nothing he saw God : when he
   saw all things as nothing he saw God, and what God means to say is this
   : when things are all reduced to naught in you then ye shall see God.

   Again, he says, a little and ye shall not see me.' While time and
   world, which is little, is within you, ye shall not see me. The angel
   swore on his eternal life that when this life is done there shall be no
   more time. And in his gospel St John quite plainly states, the world
   was made by him and they knew him not.' In line then, to quote a
   heathen doctor, world -and -time is a little thing. It is out of
   world-and-time that we see God.

   Thirdly. He said, a little and ye see me not,' as though to say : the
   very smallest thing that is foreign to the soul will prevent her seeing
   God. For heaven is shut to strangers ; even an angel from another
   heaven would not succeed in getting in, for it is not his. Why has my
   mouth, my ear, no sense of heaven ? Because they are not like it. St
   Bernard says, My eye is like the heavens in being round and clear and
   placed high in the body, nor can it brook the entry of any foreign
   matter.' Before my eye can see the painting on the wall this must be
   filtered through the air and in a still more tenuous form be borne into
   my phantasy, to be assimilated by my understanding. These properties,
   both, the soul must needs possess ; and this likeness, how subtile
   soever it may be, with its suggestiveness, its hint of sin, the soul
   rejects as foreign to herself. If God himself were foreign to the soul
   she would have none of him. What the eye perceives has to be conveyed
   to it by means, in images. If there were no means we

   should see nothing. If an angel sees another angel or anything that God
   has made, he does so by some means. But himself and God he sees
   immediately. If my soul knows an angel she knows him by some means and
   in an image, an image imageless, not in an image such as they are here.
   Soul and angel are material things compared with God. Angelic
   knowledge, anything created, is a means. Which God wholly lacks : he is
   known without means, without little. For my soul to know God with
   nothing between thou must be with me and I with thee.

   I will now suggest a meaning quite other than these three. While ye are
   little ye do not see me. To see me ye have to grow great.' Intellect is
   great indeed, yet small compared with the light of God. Our Lord
   upbraided his apostles saying, There is still in you but a little
   light.' They were not devoid of light, but it was weak, the light of
   grace, the brightest thing God ever made or ever could have made. And
   after all the soul is small so long as she is still in grace. Sometime
   or other the soul must rise in grace. If grace is not yet overcome, the
   soul has still to ascend in grace and, being perfected, to transcend
   grace : then she sees God.

   Fourthly, and ye shall not see me ' : being poor in light and grace ye
   cannot see God. One must abound in light and grace before one can see
   God. Grace is a surpassing light, superangelic. In grace we can sec God
   but from afar. While grace exists in us as grace we are not able to see
   God. Ye do not sec me because I am going to my Father.' While the soul
   progresses God remains unseen. While we are on the way to God we have
   not gotten him. With finding God all progress ends, as our Lord said to
   St Mary Magdalene, Touch me not, I am not yet ascended in thee to my
   Father.' While God is ascending in the soul and has not reached the
   zenith, we are unable to see God. St Paul says, God dwells in light
   inaccessible.' And one saint declares, No man ever saw God.' St Paul
   tells us We shall know God as we are known.' As God knows himself so we
   shall know him ; as he sees all things in himself so we shall see all
   things in him. We shall know as we are known,' St Paul says. The little
   being cleared away, I shall see as I am seen, as he sees himself,
   without little, with nothing between ; all in himself and in him all
   things, nothing outside him ; and we too shall know without little and
   without means. We shall know in his Son. The Son is the image of the
   Godhead, not the Godhead itself : he is the idea of God the Father. The
   Father's reflection is his only Son. In that idea where nothing exists,
   in that image we shall be reflected in the Son and by the Son reflected
   back into the Father : in that image, all the same, where there is no
   this nor that, we shall know

   THE IMAGE AND ITS OBJECT

   Modicum etjam non videbitis (Joh, My Latin quota-

   tion is from the Gospel of St John which wc read on Sunday. It is what
   our Lord said to his disciples, A modicum, a little, and ye see me
   not.' Anything, however small, adhering to the soul prevents your
   seeing me. St Augustine being asked the meaning of eternal life
   answered and said : Dost thou ask me what is eternal life ? Ask eternal
   life, see what it says itself. None knows what heat is like the hot,
   nor wisdom like the wise, none knows the meaning of eternal life so
   well as the eternal life itself. Our Lord Jesus Christ says, This is
   eternal life, to know thee God, the one true God.'

   A modicum, a little, and lo ! ye see me not.' Now you must understand
   that if the soul saw God even from afar, or in some intervening thing,
   as in a cloud, an instant, she would not turn away from him, not for
   all the world. What think ye then would happen if she saw God in
   himself, as he is, face to face in his naked essence ? All creatures
   God has ever made or could make if he would amount to very little, a
   mere nothing as compared with God himself. The heavens are big, so vast
   indeed, were I to tell ye would not credit me. If you could take a
   needle and prick the heavens with it, that needle-point of heaven, as
   compared with the whole heavens plus this entire world, would be
   greater than this universe compared with God. Well and truly then it
   may be said, a trifle, a little, and ye shall not sec me.' Whilst thou
   seest aught of creature thou seest naught of God ; however little, it
   must go. Says the soul in the Book of Love, I ran about and sought him
   whom my soul loveth and I found him not.' She met with angels and many
   things besides, but she found not him whom her soul loved. Then she
   goes on to say, It was but a little I passed from them and I found him
   whom my soul loveth,' just as though to say : when I had gotten beyond
   creatures (little things and of small account) I came on him whom my
   soul loveth. The soul must pass beyond, she must transcend, all
   creatures before she can find God.

   Now you must know, God loves the soul so mightily, he who should rob
   God of loving the soul would rob him of his very life and being : would
   kill God, if one may so say ; for the very love wherewith God loves the
   soul is what his Holy Breath is blowing in.

   114 MEISTER ECKHART

   But if God loves the soul so much the soul must be a most important
   thing.

   The philosopher says in his book On the Soul : If there were no means
   the eye could see a gnat, an ant, in heaven. And he was right,
   referring to the air and fire, etc. that intervene between the eye and
   heaven. Another philosopher declares that without means no eye could
   see at all. Both are expressing the same truth.

   The first one says that if there were no means the eye could see an ant
   in heaven. And that is true. If nothing intervened between God and the
   soul she would see God every whit, for God himself is wholly free from
   means and brooks no sort of intervention. If the soul were stripped of
   all her sheaths, God would be discovered all naked to her view and
   would give himself to her, withholding nothing. As long as the soul has
   not thrown off all her veils, however thin, she is unable to see God.
   Any medium, but a hair's-breadth, in betwixt the body and the soul
   stops actual union. That is true of corporal things and how much more
   of ghostly. Boethius says, Wouldst know the naked truth ? Then cast off
   joy and fear and trust and hope and pain. Joy is a means, fear is a
   means, faith and hope and pain, they all are means. While thou
   regardest them and they have regard to thee thou canst not see God.

   The second doctor says : without means the eye would see nothing. If I
   cover my eyes with my hand I can see nothing of my hand. If I put it
   before me I sec it quite distinctly. This is due to the dense nature of
   the hand which must be rarefied and rendered volatile in air and light
   and in effigy be carried to my eye. The same thing with a mirror. If
   thou hast it facing thee thy image is reflected in the glass. The eye,
   like the soul, is a mirror, and things presented to it all appear
   therein. I do not see the hand, the stone, itself : I see the image of
   the stone, but I do not see this image in a second image or by any
   other means : I see it without means and without image. This image is
   itself the means : image without image like motion without motion
   although causing motion and size which has no size though the principle
   of size. Even so the image is in this sense imageless that it is not
   seen in another image. The eternal Word is the means and the image
   itself which is without means and without image, so that the soul in
   the eternal Word conceives of God and knows him without image and with
   nothing between.

   There is one power in the soul ; intellect, of prime importance to the
   soul for making her aware of, for detecting, God. It has five
   properties. First, it is detached from here and now. Next, it is like
   nothing. Thirdly, it is pure and uncompounded.

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS 115

   Fourthly, it is in itself active or self-searching. Fifthly, it is an
   image.

   First, it is detached from here and now. Here and now, that, in other
   words, is time and place. Now is the minimum of time ; not a fragment
   of time nor a fraction of time : a smack, a con- nection, an end of
   time. Small though it be it must go ; every- thing time touches has to
   go. Again, it is detached from here. And here means place. The spot I
   am standing on is small, but it must disappear before I can see God.

   Secondly, it has no like. A philosopher says, God is a thing that
   nothing is like and that nothing can become like. But according to St
   John, we shall be called God's children ' and if we are God's children
   we must resemble God. How then can this doctor say God is a thing that
   nothing is like ? The answer is that in being like nothing this power
   is like God. God is like nothing and this power is like nothing. You
   must understand that all creatures are by nature endeavouring to be
   like God. The heavens would not revolve unless they followed on the
   track of God or of his likeness. If God were not in all things, nature
   would stop dead, not working and not wanting ; for whether thou like it
   or no, whether thou know it or not, nature funda- mentally is seeking,
   though obscurely, and tending towards God. No man in his extremity of
   thirst but would refuse the proffered draught in which there was no
   God. Nature's quarry is not meat or drink nor clothes nor comfort nor
   any things at all wherein is naught of God, but covertly she seeks and
   ever more hotly she pursues the trail of God therein.

   Thirdly, it is pure and unmingled. By nature God can tolerate no
   mingling or admixture. Nor is there in this power any inter- mingling
   or admixture : it is free from impurity and nothing foreign can occur
   therein. To tell a comely person he is fair and dark would do him an
   injustice. The soul must be without admixture. If someone hangs
   something to my cloak or sticks something on it then anyone who wears
   the eloak will wear too its attachments. If I go out hence, there will
   then go with me the whole of my attachments. What the spirit rests on,
   is attached to, takes the spirit wdth it. The man who rests on nothing,
   is attached to nothing, though heaven and earth should fall, will
   remain unmoved.

   Fourthly, it is ever seeking, travailing, within. God is such that he
   ever abides in the innermost. And intellect is ever seeking him. But
   will goes out to what it loves in him. So at the coming of my friend,
   suddenly my heart goes out to him and he is glad. St Paul declares, we
   shall know God as we are known.' And according to St John, we shall see
   God as he is.*

   Now if I am coloured I must have something in me that will take the
   colour. I should never colour unless I had a colour nature. And I can
   only see God in what he sees himself in. St Paul declares that God
   dwells in light inaccessible.' It is not to be denied that keeping in
   the way, in the entry, though all well and good, is yet a long way from
   the truth, for it is not God.

   Fifthly, it is an image. Mark this, it is important : it gives you the
   whole sermon in a nutshell. Object and image are bound up with one
   another so that we cannot part them. We can think of fire apart from
   heat and heat without the fire. We can think of the sun apart from
   light and of light as independent of the sun. But we cannot part the
   object from its image. I say more : Almighty God himself cannot
   disentangle them : they are born together and they die together. 1 do
   not die because my Father does. Suppose you die, then we no longer say,
   he is his son, we say, he was his son. Cloth that is bleached is like
   all whiteness in its whiteness. But if you blacken it, it is dead to
   whiteness. And here it is the same. If the image, God's likeness,
   disappeared, there would perish also its exemplar, God. One thing I
   would say : ye arc become two, ye are become three. Now mark my words.
   Intellect peers in, it searches every corner of the Godhead and finding
   the Son in the heart of the Father, in his ground, it takes him and
   sets him in its own. Intellect presses in ; she is not content with
   good or wisdom, nor with trutli nor yet with God himself. She is no
   more content with God than with a tree, a stone. She never rests until
   she gets into the ground whence truth and good proceed and takes them
   in principio, in the beginning, the fount of truth and goodness, where
   they rise before their coming forth : a ground far higher than truth
   and goodness arc. Her sister (will) contents herself with God as being
   good. But intellect, leaving this behind, goes in and breaks through to
   the root whence shoots the Son and whence the Holy Spirit blossoms
   forth. May we discover this and be for ever blest. So help us Father,
   Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

   KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE

   Meistcr Eckhart said : Doctors debate which is the nobler, knowledge or
   love. Some say that love is better than knowledge. I say it is not. Our
   best authorities declare that knowledge is nobler than . love. Love and
   will take God as being good. If God were not good, will would have none
   of him ; if God were not

   lovely, love would scout him. But understanding would not. Knowledge is
   not confined either to good or to love or to wisdom or lordship. By
   putting names to God the soul is only dressing him up and making a
   figure of Gk)d ; nor is this the doing of knowledge. Though God were
   neither good nor wise, still under- standing would seize him ; it
   strips everything off, not stopping either at wisdom or good, nor
   majesty nor power. It pierces to naked being and grasps God bare, ere
   he is clothed in thought with wisdom and goodness. Where the Son has
   his beatitude, there in the Father, understanding finds hers.

   Now I am going to say something never read nor preached before.

   At the College yesterday they admitted that there is a ground within
   the soul corresponding to the Father-nature. Just as the Father is
   bringing forth his Son in the Holy Ghost and these three are one God,
   so this ground is bringing forth understanding and will, one power as
   God is one Word. Withal this ground is free from any taint of creature.
   All the things we attribute to the soul form a screen round this ground
   wherein God is looking at the soul and the soul is looking at God.
   According to St Paul, We beholding the vision of God's splendour arc
   changed in that same image from glory to glory.' This image is too
   closely joined to God for creatures to dissever and God himself will
   not divide it. Alas ! we reck so little of this image, we keep it not
   so bright as it was given us by God ! Whatever wc may do God is never
   satisfied unless we there abide in utter destitution and so enable God
   at all times without ceasing to bring his one -begotten Son to birth in
   this same ground. This birth befalls not once a year nor once a day nor
   once an hour, but all the time, above time, in the while which is
   neither here nor now. This is the ground I speak of. May we live in
   suchwise that God can energise in us. So help us God.

   I have sometimes said that the soul is an imitation of God ; now I say
   that she is his image, and in the very same form the Father has
   eternally formed, and the same that Christ is formed in.

   According to Meister Eckhart, All creatures contain one re- flection :
   one, that is the denial of its being the other ; the highest of the
   angels denies he is the lowest. Gk)d is the denial of denials : the one
   which is exclusive of all otherness. To call a tree a tree is not to
   name it, for all the species are con- fused. If we name it in its first
   eruption, in its perfection, we do not call it a tree, we call it pure
   divine nature. Another notion of it, rather better. The divine nature
   is the great divider. Meister Eckhart says, The Pharisee besought our
   Lord to eat with him. What is the Pharisee ? He stands for detachment ;
   a

   MEISTER ECKHART

   Pharisee is one who is detached from all and united into one. The
   prophet cries, Lord have mercy on the work which is in thee.' The
   highest work God ever wrought was done in mercy. Under- standing goes
   in deep enough to lay hold of being simply as being- in-itself, but
   where being is losing itself, drowned in itself, there understanding
   falls away.

   Friar John says : It is a question among the theologians whether it
   lies with the soul, or with God, for her to be God. I say the power
   lies in the soul. Suppose the soul ready to be God, then God must work
   in that power and draw the power into himself : the energy then is in
   God and the capacity is in the soul. Were I wholly that I am I should
   be God ; there would be for me neither time nor place nor change. There
   is nothing so easy to me, so possible, as to be God. To stay quiet
   requires no work, whereas if I change to another I must reduce myself
   to naught : but I remain as I am.

   I say, no creature is so vile but it can boast of being; in proportion
   to its being is its power of being God, for whatever is being is God.

   Bishop Albertus says, Man is divine above all as receiving unhindered
   the inflowing Deity. In the words of the saint, The light of my soul is
   never extinguished and my desire is ever in the beholding of God.

   XLIVi

   IN ALL THINGS I SEEK REST

   In omnibus requiem queesivi (EccL 24iji). things I

   seek rest.

   The masters tell us that God made the powers of the soul by nature
   receptive to their likes, thus the car is always hearing and the eye is
   always seeing. What my eye sees is one with it, just like the air with
   light. The nature of the eye is to see colour, otherwise it would not
   be an eye. And conversely with colour, by nature it affects the eye or
   it would not be colour. To think of it as colour yet incommunicable to
   the eye would be to deny that it is colour. I can see the minster. But
   no one sees it in me. For a thing to be visible in me, it must be so
   placed that its reflection can be seen in me. Standing in front of me
   and face to face a man could see his image in my eye. Stand over
   flowing water and you cannot see yourself. But supposing it is clear,
   then where it is collected and still enough for a reflection you can
   see your form in it. They say glass is transparent, like a crystal. But
   cover it with lead or wax and it reflects : it gives an image of
   whatever stands before it, perfect in every detail.

   God made the soul, her highest power, her best, in order to beget
   himself therein. There, says a philosopher, begetter and begotten are
   the same and there is neither time nor place nor matter. Matter means
   gross bodily things ; it is intractable and hinders. Hence it has been
   said that if the Father could he would make himself. But he cannot, so
   he makes his like.

   Our Lord said, I dwell in Jacob and I rest in Israel.' Jacob stands for
   riddance. God is gotten nowhere excepting in the soul that has put all
   creatures under her feet. St Augustine says, God is being born within
   the soul the whole time without ceasing, but not born to us to whom he
   is not manifest but hidden. As long as God is hidden in the soul by
   aught, he is not born to us, and you may be quite sure that God is
   never born to any soul excepting she has put all creatures under her
   feet : where there is no other there God begets himself, not his
   likeness, his own self : God and God. Well and truly then the Son may
   say, I dwell in Jacob and in Israel 1 rest. And said he : My Father
   sent me and he engendered in me that which is my nature : that I am
   being born all the time within the soul who is pure enough for him to
   see himself in.' There God is at rest and the soul reposes in God. To
   deprive God of resting in the soul would be to deprive him of his
   deity. To rob him of it even in one's thoughts is to rob him of his
   Godhood, since he is pleased to rest in all things. David says : My
   Lord said to my heart : thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee
   in the reflection of the Holy Ghost,' and again he said : I have
   begotten thee in my innermost heart, in the depths of my soul ; I have
   spread my roots, I have estab- lished myself in the city of Zion and my
   power in Jerusalem.' The soul in Zion, who has transcended things and
   is dwelling in her central depth, in her docs God give birth to his
   inmost self. The heavenly Father said to his only Son : As I begat thee
   in my inmost heart, even so I charge thee by thy divine nature that
   thou comest not to birth save in tl\c innermost recesses of the soul.
   -- ^Whosoever would deny to God that he should beget himself in this
   way in the soul would deny him his God-nature. May God thus beget
   himself in us, So help us God. Amen.

   conversation with the soul, saying, In all things I sought rest.' To
   which the soul replies, He who created me rested in my tent.' And
   Wisdom says again, My rest is in the holy city.' If I were asked to say
   to what end the creator has created creatures, I should answer : rest.
   And were I asked a second time, what are all creatures seeking so
   eagerly by nature ? I should answer : rest. And if a third time I were
   asked what the soul seeks in all her agitations, once more I should say
   : rest.

   Look how the face of divine nature turns foolish and demented all the
   powers of the soul with longing for it, so as to draw them to itself.
   God likes this so well, it pleases him so much that his entire
   God-nature is turned into this bent. He says, In the holy place
   likewise I repose.' As the soul rests in God so God reposes in her. If
   she rests partly in God he rests partly in her. If she rests wholly in
   him he rests altogether in her. In those limpid souls where God can see
   the reflection of himself, God is reposing in the soul and the soul is
   reposing in God. To deprive God of this, though but in thought, is to
   deprive him, to deny to him, his Godhood who is seeking rest in all
   things, for God's nature is rest.

   Fourthly, whether they know it or not, creatures are all in search of
   rest. No one can shut or open his eyes without seeking rest : he is
   ridding himself of some hindrance or finding some- where to rest. These
   arc the two motives of all human action. As I often say, my love is
   placed where I most clearly see God's likeness. But rest is more like
   God than any creature.

   Mark how the soul must be for God to rest in her. She must be pure.
   What makes the soul pure ? Keeping to spiritual things. She is exalted
   too by these. The more she is exalted the purer she becomes in her
   intention and the more efficient in her work. As the philosopher says
   about the stars : they become less potent as they near the earth, being
   out of their true course In their proper orbit, though they are
   invisible on earth, they have more pull upon it. St Anselm
   apostrophises the soul, Withdraw thyself a little from the tumult of
   external things.' And again,

   Flee away and hide thee from the rush of inner thoughts which cause
   such great disquiet to the soul.'

   We can ask of God no better thing than rest. All God wants of man is a
   peaceful heart ; then he performs within the sqpl an act too Godlike
   for creature to attain to or yet see. The divine Wisdom is discreetly
   fond and lets no creature watch. As our Lord says, I will lead my bride
   into the desert and will speak to her in her heart/ into a solitude,
   that is, away from creatures.

   Fourthly, he says the soul must rest in God. God cannot do divine work
   in the soul, for in the soul things are all ruled by

   measure. Measure means limit, within and without. There is none of this
   in God's operations, which are infinite : openly enclosed in God's
   revelation. David says, God sits above the Cherubim. He docs not say,
   above the Seraphim. Cherubim means wisdom, knowledge which brings God
   to the soul and leads the soul to God. But not into God. Not in her own
   intelligence does God perform his godly operation, because in her this
   is ruled by measure ; but he uses it as being God, divine. The highest
   power steps forth (that is, the will) and breaking into God, leads in
   the soul with her intelligence and all her powers and makes her one
   with God. Here God is acting above the power of the soul : not as in
   the soul but as in God. The soul now dowsed in God and in divine
   nature, receives divine life ; now she is subject to the law of God and
   is of the order of God. To take an illustration from natural
   philosophy. At the moment of conception the child in its mother's womb
   has neither limbs nor colour. But when the soul is poured into the body
   it takes form and colour and becomes an entity (in virtue of the soul),
   with the created nature of the soul and the appearance of a living
   being. And the soul, when perfectly atoned with God and dowsed in his
   divinity, loses all her hindrances, her feebleness and instability, and
   suddenly renewed with divine life grows orderly in all her ways and
   virtues. Look at a light, the nearer the wick the duller and denser the
   glow ; as the flame shoots up from the wick it gets brighter and
   brighter. The more exalted the soul the better God can do in her his
   divine work in his own likeness. Like a mountain rising up two leagues
   above the earth, graven with magic runes and sacred characters which
   defy the winds and rain. Even so the really holy soul is uplifted into
   perfect calm, absolute and changeless in divine activity. That
   religious has good cause for shame who is moved so readily to glo#m or
   anger or desire. He is no true religious.

   Lastly, creatures are all seeking rest whether they know it or not.
   Never is the stone bereft of motion while it is not lying on the
   ground. And similarly fire. All creatures also : they seek their
   natural place. The loving soul finds rest nowhere except in God. David
   says, God has ordained to everything its place : to fish the water,
   birds the air and beasts the earth and to the soul the Godhead.' And
   Job declares in the same strain, What is in God he gives us for our joy
   and bliss.' God grant us peace and rest in him, So help us the eternal
   truth, which is himself. Amen^

   XL VII POVERTY

   The really virtuous man does not want God. What I have I want not. He
   makes no plans, he sets no store by things. As God is higher than man
   so is he readier to give than man is to receive. Not by his fasts and
   vigils and his many outward works does a man prove his progress in the
   virtuous life, but it is a sure sign of his growth if he finds eternal
   things more and more attrac- tive than the things that pass. The man
   who has a thousand marks of gold and gives it all away for love of God
   is doing a fine thing ; yet I say, it were far finer and far better for
   him to despise it, setting it at naught on God's account.

   A man should orient his will and all his works to God and having only
   God in view go forward unafraid, not thinking, am I right or am I wrong
   ? One who worked out all the chances ere starting his first fight would
   never fight at all. And if, going to some place, we must think how to
   set the front foot down we shall never get there. It is our duty to do
   the next thing : go straight on, that is the right way.

   There are five kinds of poverty. The first is devilish poverty ; the
   second, golden poverty ; the third is willing poverty ; the fourth is
   spiritual poverty ; the fifth, divine poverty.

   The first, or devilish poverty, applies to all who have not what they
   fain would have, outward or inward. That is their hell.

   The second, golden poverty, is theirs who in the midst of goods and
   properties pass empty out and in. If everything they own was burnt the
   effect on them would be to leave them quite un- moved. Heaven must
   needs be theirs and they would have no less.

   The third is willing poverty and belongs to those who, renouncing goods
   and honours, body and soul, leave everything with right good grace.
   These give judgment with the twelve apostles and by pronouncing
   judgment it is their judgment day who, knowing what they leave, yet set
   another in their heart and mightily bestir themselves about their own
   departure. Such are the willing poor.

   The fourth are spiritual poor. These have forsaken friends and kindred,
   not merely goods and honour, body and soul ; further, they are quit of
   all good works : the eternal Word does all their work while they are
   idle and exempt from all activity. And since in the eternal Word is
   neither bad nor good, therefore they are absolutely empty.

   The fifth are godly poor, for God can find no place in them to ^
   Jostes, No. 34.

   work in. Theirs is riddance without and within for they are bare and
   free from all contingent form. This is the man : in this man all men
   are one man and that man is Christ. Of him one master says, Earth was
   never worthy of this man who looks on heaven and earth the same.' This
   man is object-free in time and in eternity.

   Now enough of those who have no object in eternity, but one thing more
   of those who are objectless in time. What is meant by object ? There
   are two objects : one is otherness (not I) ; the other is a man's own
   proper self (his 1).

   The first otherness is becomings all that has come into existence ;
   such things breed otherness and pass away. This applies to the passage
   of time.

   He who knows one matter in all things remains unmoved. For matter is
   the subject of form and there can be no matter without form nor form
   devoid of matter. Form without matter is nothing at all ; but matter
   ever cleaves to form and is one undivided whole in every single part of
   it. Now since form in itself is naught, therefore it moves nothing. And
   since matter is perfectly impartible, therefore it is unmoved. This man
   then is unmoved by form or matter and is therefore objectless in time.

   Man's other object is to possess his proper self, to identify himself
   with all perfection, with that most precious treasure his own aught :
   that is his quest. Now when a thing has gotten its own form, no more
   nor less, that thing is all its own and no one else's. He who conceives
   this really is perfect in the sense that he is wholly objectless to
   eternity, etc.

   XLVII

   THIS IS LIFE ETERNAL

   Hcec est vita ceterna ut cognoscant te solum deum verum etc, (Joh.
   173). Here beginneth a discourse on a gospel saying, Christ's dictum,
   This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God and thy Son whom
   thou hast sent.'

   Now no one knows the Father except his only Son, for he says himself,
   No man knows the Father save the Son and no man knows the Son save the
   Father.' Ergo, if man is to know God, and therein consists his eternal
   bliss, he must be, with Christ, the only Son of the Father. If ye would
   be blest ye must be the only Son ; not many sons ; one Son. True, ye
   are many in your carnal birth, but ye shall be one in the eternal
   birth, for in God there is no more than the one natural spring with its
   single natural outlet of the Son ; not twain but one. And hence if ye
   are one with Christ ye are the sole issue with the eternal Word.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   How does man come to be the only Son of the eternal Father ? I answer.
   The eternal Word did not take upon itself this man or that, it took
   upon itself one indivisible free nature, human nature, bare and
   formless, for the impartible form of manhood is wholly without form ;
   and since in this union the eternal Word took human nature formless,
   therefore the Father's image, his eternal Son, became the form of human
   nature. Here it is just as true to say that man became God as that God
   became man. For human nature was transformed by taking the divine form
   which is the image of the Father. It follows that to be the Son ye must
   depart from and discard whatever makes for division in you. Man is an
   accident of nature. Do away with accidents and take yourselves in the
   freedom of your impartible humanity. But this very nature wherein ye
   take yourselves is become the Son of the eternal Father by union with
   the eternal Word, and therefore ye with Christ become the Son of the
   eternal Father by reason of enjoying the same nature which was there
   made God. Beware lest ye take yourselves as either this or that :
   realize yourselves in the liberation of your undivided manhood. If ye
   would be one ye must be rid of not, for noVs pride is division. How so
   ? Well, suppose I say, Thou art not the man. This not puts a division
   between thee and this man. To be undivided ye must be free from not
   There is one power in the soul which is immune from not, which has not
   aught in common with any mortal thing : there is nothing in this power
   ; only God is seen there face to face.

   A man being thus the Son, his motion, his energy, whatever he enjoys,
   he has gotten of his own. Now the Son of the Father is the eternal Son
   as being descended from the Father. Further, all he has he has within
   himself since he is one in essence and in nature with the Father ; his
   essence and his quiddity, he has both in himself and in this sense he
   prays, Father, as I and thou are one even so I would they should be the
   same.' And just as the Son is one with the Father in his essence, so
   thou being one with him in essence and in nature, hast got it all in
   thee as the Father has in him. Thou hast it not on loan from God,
   because God is thine own : all thou hast gotten thou hast gotten of
   thine own and such works as are not produce of thine own are dead works
   in the sight of God. These thou art moved to by extraneous things and
   they are not living : they are dead, for anything alive is endowed with
   a motion of its own. If man's works are to live they must be indigenous
   : not foreign things nor outside but within him.

   Remember. If ye love right as God ye love not right as right, therefore
   ye neither take it nor love it as a whole but as divided.

   But God is right, so ye are not taking him nor loving him in his
   entirety. Take right as right and ye take it as God. Then where right
   is at work ye will be working too, seeing that ye do right all the
   time. Though hell stood in the way of right ye would still do right and
   that not as a hardship but a pleasure, because being right itself yc
   must do right. The more a thing participates in a common nature, the
   more it is one with the impartibility of the common nature, the more
   impartible it is itself. To the whole truth, God help us. Amen,

   XLVIII

   BEHOLD, I SEND MY ANGEL

   Ecce ego mitto angelum 7neum etc. {Matt, ll^o, Luc. 737 ). Behold, 1
   send my angel before my face to prepare my way before me. And he whom
   we seek shall suddenly come into his temple. Who knoweth the day of his
   coming ? For he is as a fire that blazes up.' Suddenly, he says, he
   shall come into his temple. The soul shall come with all of her
   possessions, be they sins or be they virtues, and offer them all up at
   once, lifting them up in the Son into the Father. As the love of the
   Father is the loveli- ness of the Son. The Father loves nothing at all
   but the Son and such things as he finds in the Son. Let the soul then
   rise up in her whole power and offer herself to the Father in his Son
   so that she with the Son may be loved by the Father.

   He says, Behold, I send my angel.' The word behold suggests three
   things. Something great or marvellous or rare. Behold, I send my angel
   to refine the soul and prepare her for divine light. Divine light is
   always in the angelic light and of the angelic light. The soul would be
   troubled and distressed if God's light were not shaded therein. God,
   clouded by angelic light is always waiting to come out and shine upon
   the soul. I am wont to say, when I am asked what God is doing, that he
   is begetting his Son, bearing him ever fresh and new and with such
   delight that he does nothing else besides this work with his Holy Ghost
   and all things in it. Hence his words, Behold I.' He who says I does
   the very best work. None but the Father can say this word right. The
   act is peculiar to him and there is no issue thereof but his Son. In
   this act God tells forth his all. When God does this work in the soul,
   that is his birth ; his birth is his work and his work is his Son. God
   performs this operation in the innermost depths of the soul so secretly
   that neither saint nor angel knows, nor is the soul herself a party to
   it save that she is the patient ; God does ^it by himself. It is really
   the Father who says, I send my angel.'

   MEISTER ECKHART

   Now I maintain we cannot be content with this and will have none of
   him. It was Origen who said, Mary Magdalene sought our Lord ; she
   sought for one dead man and was disappointed to find two living
   angels.' She was right, for she expected God. Dionysius says of the
   august principalities of angels, that divine order reigns there and
   divine activity and divine likeness or divine truth, as far as that is
   possible. What is divine order but divine power and from them both
   springs love which is ardour and wisdom and truth and power. For love
   is burning in the realm of essence : transcendental, actual being, free
   from nature. It is its nature to be natureless. To think of goodness or
   wisdom or power dissembles the essence and dims it in thought. The mere
   thought obscures essence. Such is divine rule. And where God finds its
   like within the soul there docs the Father give his Son birth. The
   soul's whole power bursts alight. Out of this power, out of this light,
   leaps the flame : love. The soul with all her might ascends to the
   order of God.

   Now to speak of the order of the soul. According to a heathen doctor,
   the supernal light of the soul is very bright and clear and dearly
   loves itself, whereas the soul dislikes herself and never sheds this
   natural light upon herself unless her lower powers are ordered to her
   highest ; her natural light being high enough to reach angelic nature,
   but all averse from her inferior powers, it will not pour therein nor
   will it drench the soul unless these lower powers will give way. When a
   lord rules over a peojfle the serf is under the knight and the knight
   is under the baron. They all desire peace and to that end they will all
   help each other. And even so each several power is subject to the
   others and helps to keep peace in the soul, perfect rest. Our doctors
   define perfect rest as absolute freedom from motion. In it the soul can
   rise above herself to the order of the gods. In this absolute rest the
   Father gives the soul his only Son. Now he ranks first in order of
   divinity.

   The other members take somewhat lower rank as I was saying of the
   angels who have God's likeness very strong in them and illumination. In
   this interior light they soar above themselves into the divine image,
   all face to face with God in his divine light and so much the same that
   they do God's work. Angels illumined like this and who are so like God,
   absorb and suck in God. I often say that were I void and had this fiery
   inner love and likeness I should absorb God altogether. Light streams
   out and lights up what it falls on. To call a man enlightened as we
   sometimes do, means little. Where it comes in it is far better ; where
   it breaks through into the soul and makes her Godlike, divine, as far
   as may be, and light inwardly. In this interior light she

   towers above herself in the light of God. Now she has come home and is
   at one with him and is his fellow-worker. Nothing is wrought by
   creature, the Father works alone. The soul shall never stop until she
   works as well as God. Then she and the Father shall do his work
   together : she shall work as one with him, wisely and lovingly. That we
   may be in unity with him, God help us. Amen.

   XLIX

   BEHOLD, I SEND MY ANGEL

   Ecce mitto angelum meum (Malach. 3j, Luc, 7^^), It is written in the
   gospel, Behold, I send my angel.* Angels are within our ken for the
   evangelists deelare, we shall be like the angels.' One authority says,
   an angel is an image of God. Another one says he is fashioned like God.
   A third one describes him as a clear mirror wherein is reflected the
   goodness of God, the absolute stillness and mystery of God, as far as
   that is possible. Angels, again, have been defined to be pure
   intellectual light free from material things. We shall be like the
   angels. Perception here means seeing in the light that is in time, for
   anything I think of I think of in the light that is in time and
   temporal. But angels perceive in the light that is beyond time and
   eternal. They know in the eternal now. Men know in the now of time. The
   now of time is infinitely short. Yet take away this now of time and
   thou art everywhere and hast the whole of time. This thing or that
   thing is not all things ; as long as I am this or that, have this or
   that, I am not all things nor I have not all things. Purify till thou
   nor art nor hast not either this or that, then thou art omni- present,
   and being neither this nor that thou art all things. An angel is and
   acts as an intelligence in his degree, beholding God without ceasing
   and his object is intelligible essence. Hence he is far removed from
   things. Remote from time and tempor- alities.

   Mark the prophet's words, he says, I send my angel.' The evangelist,
   however, omits the pronoun I. This points, in the first place, to God's
   elemental nature ; to the fact that God is uiinameable, transcending
   speech in the abstraction of his essence where, without word or
   utterance, God is ineffable to creatures. It shows next, that the soul
   is ineffable and wordless ; in her proper cause she is inarticulate,
   nameless and mute. The I is suppressed because there she has neither
   word nor utterance. Thirdly, it suggests that God and the soul are so
   entirely one that God has not a single thing to tell him from the soul,
   nor is he any

   [Picture 156]

   other than the soul. The I is silent because he and the soul are every
   whit the same ; he has no property apart from soul nor does any other
   nature come within his ken. In the other reference, the text says 1 to
   indicate God's is -ness : that God simply is. All things are in God ;
   out of him, without him, is naught. All creatures are infernal and of
   no account compared with God. What they are in truth that they are in
   God, for it is God alone who is the truth ; the word I stands for the
   actuality of divine truth for it is the glyph of one-existence. It
   proclaims that God alone is. Secondly, it means that God is inseparate
   from things ; that he is more innate in them than they are in
   themselves. And man should be inseparate from things : not as cleaving
   to self but as wholly detached from himself ; thus he is inseparate
   from all things, and he is all things. So far as thou art nothing to
   thy- self so far thou art all things and iriscparate from all things ;
   and so far as thou art not divorced from all things so far thou art God
   and all things, for God's deity consists in his being present in all
   things. Wherefore the man who is inseparate from all things enjoys
   divinity as God himself enjoys it. Thirdly, the word / is in a sense
   the end of name for it is no proper name : it signifies the perfection
   of name and means immutability, dispassion : that God is immoveable,
   intangible, eternal stability.

   Fourthly, it points to the absolute purity of the divine being which is
   entirely without admixture. Goodness, wisdom and anything else that we
   can attribute to God are impurities with God's abstract essence ;
   coexistence is foreign to essence, but the word I denotes God's pure
   essence, his being in itself without anything alien and strange. The
   angels arc the image, the mirror of God, which contains the reflection
   of the Godhead, of the glory, the stillness and the mystery of God. Let
   us like the angels imitate God. According to philosophers, to make a
   portrait of a man one must not copy Conrad nor yet Henry. For if it be
   like Conrad or like Henry it will not recall the man, but will remind
   one of Conrad or of Henry. Moreover, Conrad's portrait will not be like
   Henry for, given the knowledge and the art, one could do Conrad to the
   life, the very image of him. Now, God both will and can : he made thee
   like unto himself, the very image of himself. But like him argues
   something foreign and aloof. Now there is nothing foreign nor aloof
   betwixt God and the soul, therefore the soul is not like God : she is
   identical with him, the very same as he is.

   More I do not know and cannot tell, so here my argument must end. But I
   was thinking on the way, that we ought to be utterly detached in our
   intention, having no one, nothing, in view but the Godhead as such :
   not happiness nor this nor that.

   I CAME FORTH FROM THE FATHER

   Exivi a patre et veni in mundum (Joh. ICgg)- I quote from the Gospel of
   St John. Our Lord says, I came forth from the Father and am come into
   the world and again I leave the world and return to my Father.' Another
   of his sayings is, Amen, Verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask
   of the Father in my name the same shall be yours.' Scholars say the
   word amen is an expression for stability. Our Lord says, Heaven and
   earth shall pass away before my word shall pass away,' which never
   changes. The heavens which arc manifold and the unnumbered stars are
   all self-coloured. The moon alone is pied, thick and clear, dark and
   light. That is due to the neighbourhood of earth. And our doctors teach
   that in God there is no yesterday nor morrow, it is to-day and now all
   the time in God. Augustine observes that the architect who builds a
   house therein displays his art ; though it may fall to ruin the art
   within his soul neither ages nor decays. And again Augustine says, All
   things are immutable in the eternal Word, nor do they wear away albeit
   in themselves they are corruptible, apt to be in some sort or not to be
   at all.

   He says, Verily ' {i.e, without fail or invariably), whatsoever ye ask
   of my Father in my name the same shall be yours.' Accord- ing to St
   Augustine, To pray to God for aught save God is not to pray at all.'
   John Damascene declares that seeing herself the soul sees spirit ;
   seeing an angel she sees spirit, yet, beholding God, she and the angel
   arc but corporal things compared with him.' Their mind is as matter to
   God. Angelic light is darkness as compared with him. Our Lord says,
   Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye ask in my name the same shall be
   yours,' meaning, what is in man's name is man ; what is in light's name
   is light ; what is in God's name is fixed and immutable. The name of
   God belongs to none but him who stands in this light. No man can say
   Father except he be Son and none is called Son unless he be one with
   the one-begotten Word. Whoso asks in God's name may demand of the
   Father whatever he will. Words have enormous power and have gotten it
   from the emanation of the eternal Word.

   Our Lord says, I am come into the world.' The Father comes into his Son
   with all he is, he comes into his Son with all he has,

   he comes into his Son with all that he affords and, fourthly, he comes
   in an intellectual act. It is proper to the Son to dwell in the Father
   and it is proper to the Father to dwell in his Son and in the Holy
   Ghost. The full promise of the Father is brought forth in the Son to
   the end that the Son may transmit it to the soul. To use a favourite
   simile of mine. When a stone is thrown into a pond the impact starts a
   circle, small but energetic, which sets up other circles, the second
   being larger than the first albeit not so potent and the third one
   bigger still ; one is gotten from another without stopping ; and if the
   throw was hard enough the water's edge is reached before the ripples
   are exhausted. One unique throw with the world a sheet of water and the
   water would fail ere the circles died away.

   Now mark the application. First, out of the Father there leaps forth
   the Son, small, but so puissant in his godly strength that it is he who
   causes the whole emanation. The second sally is the premier angel,
   following hard upon the first event. It speeds apace, and though less
   energetic than the first and fully small, it is endowed with so much
   force that its superfluous energy supplies the lower angels while its
   successors, yet more widely flung, are bigger in circumference than the
   second or the first. They keep on brimming out the one behind the
   other, all busy pouring themselves forth from the highest to the lowest
   of the angels ; but however far it be from the initial sally of the
   eternal Word to the first angel, this latter is too high to be affected
   by any eori)oral thing. Further. Our master claims for the lowest of
   the angels that in view of his energy projecting into God, the very
   basest of the inferior angels has so much of God's might that the
   smallest fraction (a chip as it were from the carpenter's axe), the
   minutest trace, of his activity makes all things grow and flourish. If
   this chip does not fall from his work, everything instantly perishes.
   They spread far and wide, reproducing so far as they may the first
   welling out of the Son from the Father ; but this first emanation was
   so charged with power that given a thousand or more worlds they would
   be wanting in capacity ere the first issue had been spent, just as the
   water's edge was reached before the ripples were exhausted that arose
   from the impact of the stone.

   Boethius says the world of the soul is called pure because she is

   which has gotten her into the perfect image of the divine world and
   wholly there abides, not peering forth but, all aloof from the outside
   world, standing still in the light-world

   in God. Into this soul comes the Son, begotten there in all the panoply
   of God : Father, Son and Holy Ghost, all together in one perfect being.
   The soul that has gotten in her the Son, has in one perfect entity the
   entire promise of the Godhead. One thing more. Creatures communicate
   themselves so far as they are good. It is peculiar to God as being
   wholly good that into whomsoever does partake of him he empties himself
   wholly in his Son. Which is another argument for the soul who has
   gotten the Son receiving the Godhead altogether. Thirdly, the Father is
   performing, in his Son, an intellectual operation. According to the
   philosophers, man's highest happiness consists in the mental exercise
   of wisdom. And the Father's whole delight, his perfect bliss, is this
   intellectual wont which is the birth of his Son. This birth he so
   enjoys that he puts his whole might into it and his entire nature.
   Accordingly the soul having gotten the Son by a feat of understanding,
   in him possesses all that God can give, in one perfect joy and bliss.

   Our Lord says, I came forth from the Father and am come into this
   world,' into the light-world, that is. The soul, true reflection of the
   divine world, into her enters the Son ; just as he falls from the
   Father he is born in the soul. In this very same birth he is born in
   the world, in the soul, and bearing her up brings her to birth in the
   Father. As he says, again I leave the world,' the outer world, and
   rc-ascend to my Father,' with the light- world of the soul, copy of the
   world divine, made on the same last, in the same likeness. He carries
   her up to his Father, into the first, into the ground whence the Son
   comes out and strikes down from the Father.

   There is another meaning in his words, I came forth from the Father,'
   which is this : the Father goes into his Son in all his deity, for he
   is wholly intellectual. He goes clean into his Son. Had he more sons
   they would get naught ; he could never have but one Son for he is none
   other than his understanding. Had he a thousand sons they must needs be
   all the same Son.

   Our Lord says, I came forth from the Father and am come into the world.
   Again I leave the world and return to my Father.' He implies that his
   going out is his going into the soul. But her going in is her going
   out. The soul goes out of her outermost into her innermost, out of her
   own into the Son's. Her being caught up to the Father is his quitting
   the outer world and, with the soul, ascending once more to his Father.
   Mark tells of some- one addressing our Lord as Good Master.' He
   replied, There is none good but God,' for in coming forth he falls
   clean into the soul with all he is. No creature exists that can give
   itself whole ; it goes out in kindness and work but itself stays at
   home. His

   exit is his entrance. His passage out of the Father is his passage into
   the soul. Ilis emanation verily is God giving himself once for all in
   his Son. We say : the only-begotten Son who proceeds from the Father is
   the same as himself. From the moment the Father launches forth in all
   his might in the Son, he (the Father) reverts to pure essence. He has
   no other course seeing he has spent all his substance on his Son. Were
   there no time nor place nor matter, nothing left at all, the begetter
   would be as the begotten. It follows that the Son so called, must be
   the only Son and be one with the Father who utters in one single Word
   the whole of what he knows, the whole of what he can afford, in one
   single instant, and that instant is eternal.

   Now our doctors say : natural acts make for unity. God vouchsafes
   himself, gives himself, as a whole to the soul in order that she may be
   one with him. Moreover, his first issue is his only Son. Again, our
   doctors teach that the highest of the angels is pure yet he forms a
   part of nature. But the only Son never entered any nature, he remained
   superior to nature : in pure being he went into the Father. The second
   eruption into nature, so our masters say, the highest spirit, remained
   by nature simplex, one in proportion to the nearness of his nature (to
   its origin). He broke in to let us out : his exit thence is his
   entrance here. TIcncc his words, Let. . . .'

   HE SOUGHT TO SEE . . . WHO HE WAS

   that when our Lord walked upon earth in human nature there was a rich
   man who sought to see him, and eould not for the press for he was small
   of stature.' According to a holy man. Only he is rich who has plenty of
   God and virtue. To be well off for goods and stinted for God makes one
   poor and not rich, for things are as nothing to God. Hence the protest
   of that seigneur whom his retainers lauded for his power and his
   riches. Quoth he, I trow they laud not me one whit who have forgot my
   strongest claim to praise, my power over my body to demand of it what I
   will.' This man who sought to see .lesus did outrun the crowd and
   climbed up into a tree in order to see him. And Jesus said, Make haste
   and come down, for to-day I abide at thine house.' Whoso would see
   Jesus must outrun all things. What does it show when a man does not
   hasten past things ? It shows he has not tasted God. If he had tasted
   God he would hasten to pass by all things, and not pass by merely but
   break through all creatures. What his love is ready to leave he breaks

   through. If wc fail to see God that is due to our feeble desire no less
   than the concourse of creatures. Aim high, be high. To see God needs
   high aspiration. Know, ardent desire and abject humility work wonders.
   I vow God is omnipotent, but he is impotent to thwart the humble soul
   with towering aspiration. And where I cannot master God and bend him to
   my will it is because I fail either in will or meekness. I say, and I
   would stake my life upon it, that by will a man might pierce a wall of
   steel, and accordingly we read about St Peter that on catching sight of
   Jesus he walked upon the water in his eagerness to meet him.

   Look you : a thing that grows in the filling will never get full. Take
   a vessel, a stoup ; if you pour a stoup in and it stretches thereby
   then it will not be full. And so with the soul : the more she demands
   the more she is given ; the more she receives the bigger she grows. Who
   is Jesus ? lie has no name. Where do we sec God ? Where there is no
   yesterday nor morrow : where it is now and to-day, there we sec God.
   What is God ? One master says, If I were forced to tell of God then 1
   should say, God is a thing no mind can reach or grasp and that is all 1
   know about him. Another master says, lie who knows of God that he is
   unknown, that man knows God. Then comes St Augustine with his dictum,
   God is something sovran, supreme, which is common to all partakers. lie
   means that God is somewhat wherein every creature must be ; for if he
   fall out of the hand of the mercy of God he will fall back into the
   hand of the justice of God. lie must ever be in him. Needs must a man
   have his being in God and have enjoyment in God withal, aye in God
   himself, an he will. But he who docs not lind eternal satisfaction and
   enjoyment in God himself must get it out of things, things that arc
   base, far lower than his footstool ; yet creatures without exception
   get their being from God, even the damned in hell persist on somewhat
   of his being. Though they dwell not in God in felicity, still they must
   go on without him, against their will, in damnation. What folly it is
   to refuse to be with him wc cannot be without !

   St Augustine says, What is God ? lie is something we cannot conceive
   any better.' But I say, God is better than anything we can conceive ; 1
   say, God is somewhat, I know not what, verily I know not. He is all
   that is being rather than not- being, existent more than non-existent ;
   our highest aspirations arc but grovelling things falling hopelessly
   short of God. He transcends heart's desire. When I preached at Paris I
   declared, and I durst now repeat, that not a man at Paris can conceive
   with all his learning what God is in the very meanest creature, not
   even in a fly. More- over, I now say that the whole world is powerless

   LII

   THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE

   Consideravit domum etc. The good housewife looks well to the ways of
   her house, not eating the bread of idleness.' This house represents the
   soul as a whole, and the ways of the house are the powers of the soul.
   An ancient philosopher says the soul is made in between one and two.
   The one is eternity, ever alone and without variation. The two is time,
   changing and given to multiplication. He means to convey that the soul
   in her higher powers touches eternity, God to wit, while her lower
   powers being in contact with time make her subject to change and biased
   towards bodily things, which degrade her. Could the soul know God as
   well as the angels do she would never have come into body. If she could
   know God without the world the world would not have been made for her
   sake. The world was contrived on her account for training and bracing
   the eye of the soul to endure divine light. The sunshine falling on the
   earth is dimmed first in the air and diffused on various things, for no
   human eye can support the sun. And even so the light of God is over
   strong and bright for the soul's eye to bear, without being fixed and
   given up by matter and reflection which accustom it to dwelling in the
   light divine.

   In her superior powers the soul is in contact with God ; so she takes
   after God. God takes after himself ; he has gotten his form from
   himself and from no one beside. Ilis form is that of perfect
   self-knowledge, absolute light. When the soul comes in contact with him
   in real understanding, then she is like him in form. Suppose you press
   a seal into green wax or red, or into cloth, just enough for the seal,
   the seal being stamped right into the wax so that none of the wax is
   left over unsealed, then it is one and the same with the seal. In just
   the same way the soul is wholly united with God in image and form when
   she is in contact with him in actual gnosis. St Augustine says the soul
   is of more noble build than any other creature, and that is why no
   mortal thing, destined to perish at the latter day, can hold
   communication with

   or eke affect the soul save from a distance and by messengers. Such are
   the eyes and ears and the five senses : these are the soul's ways out
   into the world, and by these ways the world gets back into the soul.
   According to one master, the powers of the soul flow back into the soul
   laden with fruits ; they never go out but they bring something back. So
   beware lest thine eyes bring back aught to hurt thy soul. My firm
   conviction is that everything a good man sees must better him. On
   seeing evil he thanks God for saving him therefrom and prays God to
   convert him to what he is. On seeing good his great desire will be to
   have it perfected in him.

   This seeing serves two purposes : it scotches what is mischievous and
   makes us forthwith remedy our faults. Many a time I have laid it down
   that great workers, great fasters, great vigil-keepers, if they fail to
   mend their wicked ways, wherein true progress lies, do cheat themselves
   and are the devil's laughing-stock. A man once had an arrow he grew
   rich on. lie was neighbour to a sower. When the arrow was in use a
   breeze from any quarter would catch it by the head and turn its tail
   into the wind. So this man approached the sower and quoth he, What will
   you give me to tell you the way of the wind ? ' Thus he sold his arrow
   and waxed rich thereby. And so might we become right rich in virtue by
   finding out our frailties, and then, in rue, setting ourselves to cure
   them.

   This St Elizabeth did with much care. She looked well to the ways of
   her house. She had no fear for the winter for her house- hold was
   doubly clad. Probable ills she provided against. Any lack she worked
   hard to supply. So she ate not the bread of idleness. Withal her
   superior powers she kept oriented to God. The superior powers of the
   soul arc three. The first is intuition ; the second irascibilis, i,e,
   the power of attack ; the third is will. In the act of imbibing
   knowledge of the very truth into the impartible power whereby we
   apprehend God, the soul is a light. And God too is light, and when the
   divine light is flooding the soul, soul becomes merged into God just
   like a light into light. Then she is called the light of faith which is
   a divine virtue. And whither the soul is unable to go with her senses
   and powers thither faith takes her.

   The second is the attacking force whose special function it is to
   progress. As the eye is for seeing colour and shape and the ear is for
   hearing sweet voices and sounds, so the soul with this power is ever
   advancing ; if she glances aside to waver from him, that is sin. She
   cannot brook that aught should be above her. I trow she cannot brook
   God even being above her ; unless he be within her and she has gotten
   as good as God himself, she

   never rests. With this power God is apprehended by the soul, as far as
   that is feasible to creature and so it is called hope, whieh is a
   divine virtue also. Herein the soul has such a clear prospect of God
   that she fondly imagines God in his whole being has not a thing
   withholdcn from her. King Solomon says, Stolen waters are sweet.' And
   St Augustine tells us, The pears I stole were nicer than the ones my
   mother gave me, because they were forbidden and locked up.' So is that
   grace far sweeter to the soul which she has won by special work and
   wisdom than that which is our common property.

   The third power is interior will, turned ever face-like towards God in
   godly will, drawing from God his love into itself. God is drawn by the
   soul and the soul is drawn by God, and this is divine love, another
   divine virtue. Divine felicity lies in three things. In knowledge and
   in liberation from the bondage of creature : in having enough of,
   having finished with, self and all creatures. Further, the soul's
   perfection lies in gnosis, in conception, in conceiving God and in
   union of perfect love. Do we want to know what sin means ? Lapsing from
   felicity and virtue, that is the whole cause of sin. It behoves every
   soul to look to her ways. She had no fear for the winter with her
   household doubly clad,' as the scriptures tell of her. She was clothed
   with strength to withstand imperfection and was adorned with the truth.
   To all appearance this woman was rich and had the world at her feet,
   but in secret she knelt at the shrine of true poverty. And when her
   outward comforts failed she fled to him to whom all creatures flee,
   setting at naught the world and self. In this way she trans- cended
   self, despising men's despisery and not minding it, for all she had in
   mind was the tending of the sick and the cleansing of the foul, which
   she managed by dint of her pure heart. Even so let us look to the ways
   of our house and not cat the bread of idleness. So help us God. Amen.

   WHOSOEVER WOULD COME AFTER ME

   Dominus dicet : qui vult venire post me etc, {Matt, I624 ; Luc, 923).
   Our Lord says, Whosoever would come to me let him take up his cross and
   with willing martyrdom forsake himself and follow me.' Everything by
   nature is pursuing God after its own fashion. Fire draws upwards, earth
   falls downwards, and similarly every creature here is searching out the
   place God has ordained it for. Origen says a man forsakes himself when
   he by striving rids himself of customary sins and denies himself those
   things

   he is addicted to ; so doing he takes up his cross with willing pain
   and disciplines himself in virtuous uses. Basilius, the saint, once
   said that any man who leaves the things that are behind him and beneath
   him and which are not God, has left himself. And treating of this
   subject in the book wherein he speaks about the soul, St Augustine
   calls her nobler, mightier, grander than any other creature and in
   these respects most like to God of all, barring the angels, who arc
   nobler than her nature because they were the first to be poured forth
   and loosed from spirit although they keep a refuge in it. This the soul
   has not. She has to pour into the body.

   Various people comment sagely upon this : If God is quite impartible
   why did he not create all things simply like the angels ? That w^ould
   never do, theologians say. One sort of creature could not show forth
   God. He made many kinds of creatures for each one to show forth a
   modicum of God albeit no more of him that one drop of water reveals
   about the sea. Not but what a drop of water tells us more about the
   sea, and indeed the universe, than any creatures can reveal (of God).
   For out of drops we might get a sea, but not by means of any ercatures
   could we succeed in getting God. St (iregory observes that, The soul
   whom God shines into so that she sees him somewhat, to her creatures
   arc dwarfed or merely ciphers.

   Thirdly, the text refers to one who dies a martyr's death as forsaking
   self. Our Lord says, Moses, to me no man comes as himself.' Now
   according to St Chrysostom, To be an other than I am I must abandon
   that I am.' This is accom])lished by humility. * Nothing ', says St
   Gregory, gives more power than does lowliness.' We sec this well with
   Moses, who when he wanted to rest drove his flock of sheep into the
   valley. It was there he saw the bush burning but not consumed. I will
   go,' said Moses, and look at this great sight.' Then God called to him,
   Stay, Moses, go no further ! Doff thy shoes.' The feet arc symbols of
   desire. They must be bare : drawn out of everything temporal and mortal
   ; then the soul can offer her whole self to her Lord. One of the saints
   has said that if the soul should rise and, being unillumined, offer
   herself to our Lord she would be rebuffed and come to grief ; like an
   eye that likes trying to look at the sun finds it grows weaker and
   blinder.

   are said of the three Persons and the unity of their nature. From him
   applies to the Father, the origin of all things in eternity and in
   time. Through him applies to the Son, through whom all things proceeded
   forth. In him applies to the Holy Ghost, in whom all things are
   contained, made spirit and brought back to their end. From another
   point of view these words, again, betoken the three Persons by their
   from and through and in. As these words are distinct even so do they
   show the distinction of the Persons. Put from the word him (which is
   the same for all) we gather the oneness of their nature. He says, To
   him be glory and honour.' Proclaiming the three Persons as one God, to
   whom alone be all honour.

   Now we proceed to speak of the things of God, of Persons and of
   essence, which we hardly understand. Those that cannot follow this
   discourse can take refuge in the dogma I have ta ight before, that the
   three Persons arc in one essence and one essence in the three Persons.
   Remember we are speaking of Father and paternity, and you must
   understand that these two are not apart in two hypostases, but they are
   one hypostasis, and moreover they arc one and three rationally
   speaking. Consider the meaning of paternity. It means the power of
   father-kind. A father is known by the fact that he begets, but we
   recognise paternity in a potential father. Take, for example, the maid
   who is a virgin. By nature she is maternal though not actually mother.
   The same thing with a father ; in his power to beget he is paternal,
   but the fact of his begetting makes him father. Mark this difference
   between father and paternity when the Word is gotten ghostly in the
   soul. This we take to be the case when the soul, sublimed and in the
   proper state, grows pregnant with God's light and divine by nature : by
   the unique power of God grown big with Deity. You sec, in this immanent
   power, soul too is paternal. But radiant with revelation, she with the
   F'athcr begets and is then with the Father called father. This father
   and fatherhood differ as applied to the soul. Mark, too, that Son
   differs from filiation, remembering that these two are not separate in
   two hypostases : they arc the same hypostasis. We find filiation in
   potential father-nature, unborn. If he were not unborn in his potential
   nature the Father could not beget him, for a thing that comes out must
   first have been in. So much for filiation. But the Son we explain as
   the Father's begetting of his own Word, whereby the Father is Father.
   The Son, moreover, is God in himself, not God of himself but of the
   Father alone. Were he God of himself he would not be one with the
   Father so there would be two without any beginning. Which is
   impossible. We postulate three distinct properties, the Father's
   property is that

   he comes from none but himself. The Son's property is that he does not
   come from himself : he descends from the Father by way of nativity. The
   Holy Ghost's property is that he comes from the Father not as being
   born : he proceeds from them twain, both Father and Son, not as a birth
   but as love. For two who are sundered in Person cannot together bear
   one but they can bear mutual love. The Holy Ghost is not born because
   he proceeds out of two and not merely out of the Father, albeit certain
   doctors do maintain that the Holy Ghost comes from the Father alone and
   not from the Son at all. This is false ; for when the Father gat the
   Son he gave him his whole nature as well as all perfection, which goes
   with being of that nature, the Father withholding nothing from his Son.
   It follows that the Father cannot alone bring forth the Holy Ghost as
   he alone did get the Son. Had these doctors envisaged it aright, they
   would no doubt have said the same. They were speaking without
   understanding. So it is wrong to say the Son is God from himself and
   not from the Father. The Son may be said to bring forth the Spirit yet
   not from himself : from the Father whence he comes himself. Thus the
   Holy Ghost comes from them twain and not from one ; but not as being
   twain, as being one. So much for the Son and filiation.

   It may be asked concerning Spirit and spiration, Can we use these terms
   or not ? Is there some objection, which makes it inad- missible ?
   Filiation is found latent in the nature of the Father, that is plain,
   seeing he is not merely brought forth out of him. Herein lies the
   objection to speaking of Spirit and spiration. Let us see if we can
   find precisely the right meaning of Spirit and spiration. We have here
   two and one. That is the difference between Spirit and spiration. In
   the first, wlicn we predicate two we mean Father and Son. But by saying
   in one we refer to spiration. This same in one is formless : the mark
   of spiration. Again, when we say in another that signifies Spirit, who
   is another than Father and Son in his Person.

   I have lent him yet not trust in the man. So if a man believes in God
   why will he not trust him to repay what he lends his poor ? He who
   gives up all things gets back an hundredfold. If he expects his
   hundredfold he shall get nothing : he is not giving up the things but
   getting more, an hundredfold. Our Lord repays an hundredfold the man
   who leaves all things. Letting go all things he gets an hundredfold
   return and eternal life. If it happens to a man in the course of
   riddance to get again the very same he gave, then, not giving all, he
   shall get nothing. Anyone who looks to find anything in God, knowledge,
   understanding or devotion or whatever it may be, even if he find it
   will not be finding God but knowledge, understanding or devotion : all
   things I heartily commend ; but to him not lasting.

   Seek nothing at all, not understanding nor gnosis nor piety nor
   inwardness nor peace but only God's will. The soul who is as she by
   rights should be, would not be satisfied even if God gave her his whole
   Godhead ; it would no more console her than his giving her a fly.
   God-knowledge is vain apart from God-will. In God's will are all
   things, eternal and perfect and pleasant to God ; but out of God's will
   things are all of them naught and not pleasant to God and not perfect.
   Never pray for any mortal thing ; if thou must pray for anything at
   all, pray for God's will and nothing else for therein thou hast all. To
   ask for aught beside means getting nothing. In him is naught but one
   and one is indivisible and aught save one is part, not one. God is one
   and anything extra that is sought or found is not God but a fraction.
   Peace, intuition or anything else than simply God's will is for
   self-love and is naught ; but if he seeks God's naked will then
   whatever he may find or have revealed to him therein that man may take
   as a gift of God without ever thinking or looking to sec if it is of
   nature or of grace or from whence or in what wise it may be : he need
   have no anxiety whatever on that score ; he is going the right way and
   while following the broad lines of the Christian life there is no need
   to scrutinize each detail. He can just take each thing from God, and
   whatever comes accept it as the best for him, and have no fear of
   meeting on his lonely road with anything, do what he may, that hinders
   his awareness of the love of God, which to him is all that matters.

   People have a way of saying, when it falls to them to do or suffer
   something, If only I knew it was the will of God I would gladly suffer
   and put up with it.' Dear God I what a question for a sick man to ask,
   docs God intend me to be ill ? He ought to know it is the will of God
   by the very fact of being ill. And so with other things. Whatever comes
   accept it as God's will, pure and simple. Some, when things prosper
   with them, inwardly

   or outwardly, praise God and have faith in him. They will say, for
   instance, I have gotten four quarters of corn this year and as many of
   wine : I put my trust in God.' Nay, I say thou dost trust in the corn
   and the wine.

   The soul is created for good so great, so high, that she cannot rest in
   any mode ; all the time she is hastening past modes to the eternal
   good, to God who is her goal. This is not won in the heat of the
   assault, in the stress and strain of action or of passion, but by
   gentleness and true humility and self-abnegation in that and everything
   that may betide. A man should not dragoon himself :

   Thou shalt do this at whatever cost,' that would be wrong for so he
   lends importance to himself. If anything should chance to grieve or
   trouble or disquiet him, again he would be wrong for that means giving
   way to self. When out of the depths of humilia- tion he calls on God
   for counsel and bending low before him accepts with quiet faith
   whatever he may send, then he is right. It all depends, in teaching and
   advising, if a man will listen, disregarding everything but God. Many
   and various are the ways of putting this, but it promotes the proper
   play of conscience to refuse attention to casual happenings and for a
   man when he is by himself to make an offering of his will to God and
   then proceed to take each thing alike from God, grace or whatever
   comes, inward or outward.

   Whoso sees aught of God's secs naught of God. The righteous man does
   not need God. What I have I am not in need of. He serves for naught, he
   cares for naught, he has God and that is all he needs. As God is higher
   than man so is he readier to give than man is to receive. Not by
   fasting and good works can we gauge our progress in the virtuous life,
   but a sure sign of growth is a waxing love for the eternal and a waning
   interest in temporal things. The man who owns an hundred crowns and
   gives them all in the name of God to found a cloister is doing a good
   work. And yet I say, it were a better to despise and naught himself for
   love of God. It behoves a man in all he docs to turn his will in God's
   direction and keeping only God in view to forge ahead without a qualm,
   not wondering, am I right or am I doing something wrong ? If the
   painter had to plan out every brush-mark before he made his first he
   would not paint at all. And if, going to some place, we had first to
   settle how to put the front foot down, we should never get there.
   Follow your principles and keep straight on ; you will come to the
   right place, that is the way.

   This is a collation of Meister Eckhart's.

   THE EMANATION AND RETURN

   Nolite timere eos qui corpus occidunt, animuni autem occidere non
   possunt {Matt. lOgg). Fear not them which kill the body but are not
   able to kill the soul.' Spirit does not kill spirit ; spirit gives life
   to spirit. Them which kill you ' are flesh and blood which die by one
   another. Man's most precious possession is blood, when it is
   well-liking. The most mischievous thing in man is blood when it is
   ill-liking. When the blood rules the flesh, the person is humble and
   patient and chaste and has all the virtues. But where the flesh has the
   upper hand he is supercilious, hasty, and lascivious and has all the
   vices. Praised be St John the glorified of God himself.

   Now mark. I will say something I never said before. When God created
   the heavens and the earth and all creatures, God did no work ; he had
   no work to do ; there was no activity in him. God said: We will make a
   likeness.' To create is easy : we do it when and as we will. But what I
   make, I make myself, with myself and in myself, imprinting my image
   clearly in it. We will make a likeness ' : not the Father nor the Son
   nor the Holy Ghost: we, the holy Trinity in concert, we will make a
   likeness.

   When God made man he wrought in the soul his like work, his
   ever-cherished, his working work. This work was a great one, no less
   than the soul : she was the work of God. God's nature, his being and
   his godhood depend upon his working in the soul. God be praised, God be
   praised ! God works in the soul ; he is in love with his work. The work
   is love and the love is God. God loves himself and his nature, his
   essence and his Godhead. In the love wherein he loves himself therein
   God loves all creatures. With the love wherewith God loves himself
   therewith he loves all creatures, not as creatures : creatures as God.
   In the love wherein God loves himself therein he loves all things.

   Again I say what I have never said before. God enjoys him- self. In the
   joy wherein God enjoys himself therein he enjoys all creatures. With
   the joy wherewith God enjoys himself he enjoys all creatures, not as
   creatures : creatures as God. In the joy wherein God enjoys himself,
   therein he enjoys all things. And mark. All creatures tend towards
   their ultimate perfection. Apprehend me, I beseech you, by the eternal
   ever-valid truth and by my soul. For yet again I say a thing I never
   said before : God and Godhead are as different as earth is from heaven.
   More- over I declare : the outward and the inward man are as different,
   too, as earth and heaven. God is higher, many thousand miles.

   Yet God comes and goes. But to resume my argument : God enjoys himself
   in all things. The sun sheds his light upon all creatures, and anything
   he sheds his beams upon absorbs them, yet he loses nothing of his
   brightness. All creatures sacrifice their life for being. Creatures all
   come into my mind and are rational in me. I alone prepare all creatures
   to return to God. Beware, all of you, what ye do.

   To return to my inner and my outer man. I see the lilies in the field,
   their gaiety, their colour, all their leaves. But I do not see their
   fragrance. Why ? Because what I give out is in me. What I am saying is
   in me and I speak it forth of me. My outward man relishes creatures as
   creatures, as wine and bread and meat. But my inner man relishes things
   not as creature but as the gift of God. And again to my innermost man
   they savour not of God's gift but of ever and aye. I take a bowl of
   water and place a mirror in it and set it in the sun. The sun sends
   forth his light-rays both from his disc and also from the bottom of the
   bowl, suffering thereby no diminution. The reflection of the mirror in
   the sun is in the sun. The sun and it are thus what it is. And so with
   God. God is in the soul with his nature, his essence and his Godhood,
   but he is not on that account the soul. The soul's reflection is in
   God. God and she are thus what she is. There God is all creatures.
   There God's utterance is God.

   While I subsisted in the ground, in the bottom, in the river and fount
   of Godhead, no one asked me where I was going or what I was doing :
   there was no one to ask me. When I was flowing all creatures spake God.
   If I am asked. Brother Eckhart, when went ye out of your house ? Then I
   must have been in. Even so do all creatures speak God. And why do they
   not speak the Godhead ? Everything in the Godhead is one, and of that
   there is nothing to be said. God works, the Godhead does no work, there
   is nothing to do ; in it is no activity. It never envisaged any work.
   God and Godhead are as different as active and inactive. On my return
   to God, where I am formless, my breaking through will be far nobler
   than my emanation. I alone take all creatures out of their sense into
   my mind and make them one in me. When I go back into the ground, into
   the depths, into the well-spring of the Godhead, no one will ask me
   whence I came or whither I went. No one missed me : God passes away.

   All happiness to those who have listened to this sermon. Had there been
   no one here I must have preached it to the poor-box. Some poor souls
   will go back home and say, I shall settle down and eat my bread and
   serve God. Verily I say, they persist in error, and will never have the
   power to strive for or to win what those others do who follow Christ in
   poverty and exile. Amen.

   SUCH IS THE NATURE OF GOD

   A master cries, Dear God, how well for me did my love bear fruit !

   Our Lord says to every loving soul, I was made man for you, and if ye
   are not God for me ye wrong me. I in my God-nature did dwell in your
   man's nature, so that none guessed my godly might seeing me walk like
   any other man. And even so shall ye in your humanity hide you in my
   divinity, and none shall guess your human weakness : your life being
   all divine they shall see naught in you but God.' This does not mean
   soft words or pious mien or much parade of holiness, so that our name
   borne far and and wide is highly honoured by the friends of God ; nor
   that as cherished and elect of God we fondly think God has forgot all
   creatures but ourselves and anything we ask of God is straight- way
   done. No, not by any means ! That is not what God wants of us : all the
   other way.

   He would have us found wholly unmoved wheri people call us cheats and
   liars or whatever it may be whcrcl^y we are bereft of our fair name ;
   and not only evil speaking but evil deeds as well : denying us our
   animal necessities ; and not only temporal needs but bodily hurt. (He
   would that) our sickness, or whatever ill it be, should help us in our
   bodily work ; that we should always do our best despite that people
   turn it to the worst account ; further, that we should suffer in this
   sense not alone from people but from God as well, who, withholding from
   us his present con- solation, builds as it were a wall between us and
   when we bring our work to him seeking his help and comfort, he behaves
   towards us as if he shut his eyes and refused to sec or hear : he
   leaves us in our need to stand and fight alone, like Christ forsaken by
   his Father. Then hiding us in his divinity, behold us unbowed down by
   woe and with no other help than the words Christ uttered,

   Father, they will be done.'

   Such is the nature of God that we know it by nothing better than
   naught. -- How, by naught ? -- By getting rid of all means, not merely
   by spurning the world and the possession of virtue ; I must let virtue
   go if I would see God face to face ; not that I should flout virtue,
   but virtue being innate in me I transcend virtue. When a man's mind has
   lost touch with every thing then, not till then, it comes in touch with
   God. A heathen philo- sopher has said, nature cannot transcend nature.
   Ergo, no creature can see God. If he is seen it must be in light that
   is supernatural. Theologians have a question, When God uplifts

   the soul above himself and above all creatures and leads her home into
   himself, why does he not raise up the body too so that it has no
   earthly needs ? One of the masters -- I think St Augus- tine -- answers
   this as follows. When the soul attains to union with God then at last
   the body enjoys all things to God's glory. Through man all creatures
   have flowed forth and the body's rational use of creatures is not a
   drawback to the soul : it is an added dignity, for creatures can find
   no better way of returning to their source than in the righteous man
   who of his soul can say that even for an instant it has been absorbed
   in union with God. For then there is no obstacle between God and the
   soul, and as far as the soul follows God into the desert of his Godhead
   so far the body follows the bodily Christ into the desert of his
   willing poverty : as the soul is united with his deity so the body is
   atoned in Christ by the operation of true virtue. Well, then may the
   heavenly Father say, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,'
   for not only has he gotten in the soul his only Son : he has begotten
   her his only Son.

   From the very bottom of my heart I say, Man, how can aught afflict thee
   or be hard to bear when thou considerest that he who yonder subsisted
   in the form of God and in the day of his eternity and in the glory of
   the saints, and who before was born the splendour and substance of God,
   did enter the prison, the trap of thy sense- nature which is so unclean
   that aught, however pure, is besmirched and fouled by coming near it,
   yet notwithstanding this he abode there for thy sake ? What is there
   thou wouldst not gladly suffer, reading of the bitterness of thy Lord
   and God, pondering the afflictions, all the woes, that did befall him ?
   The scorn and contumely he bore from king and soldier, from knaves and
   passers by his cross ? How the glory of the eternal light was mocked
   and scorned and tortured ? Behold, what innocence, compassion and true
   love, and nowhere shown to me more clearly than where the love-power
   pierced his heart. Make thee then a bundle of the woes of thy Lord God
   and let it lie between thy breasts. Regard and realize his virtues, how
   all his works make for thy weal, and see thou pay him back in his own
   coin his infamous and shameful death and his pain-bearing nature
   wherein he, sinless, suffered for thy sin as if it had been his ; as he
   says in the Prophets concerning his afflictions, Lo, I suffer for my
   sins,' and speaking of *the fruits of all his labours, By your works
   shall ye possess this kingdom I ' calling our sins his sins and his
   works our works ; and he has answered for our sins as though he had
   committed them, whereas we profit by his works as though they were our
   own. And this should make our labour light, for the good knight laments
   not his own. wounds, seeing his king who is wounded with

   DIVINE UNDERSTANDING

   Lord God Almighty, all things are in thy power. Power and lordship lie
   in two things, in freedom and in the possession of many good things in
   peace. What is freedom ? A heathen philosopher says, That thing is free
   which cleaves to naught and to which naught cleaves.' So there is
   nothing free but the first cause, that is, the cause of all things.

   To lordship belongs the ])ossession of many good things and beautiful.
   God is all good in all ; hence he possesses himself in all. What God
   has, that is he in all. The love and will, the wisdom, the goodness we
   say that he has, these he is. If God is this, he is not naught, for God
   was prior to naught. God has no before nor after : but naught has a
   sequel ; its sequel is aught. Naught's foregocr was God, for lie was
   prior to naught. Naught's issue is aught. God then has no before nor
   after. Lo, the cause of all things, self-subsistcnt, discriminate light
   which is himself ! God is a light shining in itself in silent
   stillness. The one light, the one essence itself, which knows and
   understands itself. The understanding of this unique light is the light
   from the light, it is the eternal Person of the Son from the eternal
   Person of the Father. The Father spoke one Word, namely, his Son. In
   this only AVord he spoke all things. The Word of the Father is none
   other than his understanding of himself. The understanding of the
   Father understands that he understands, and that his under- standing
   understands is the same as that he is who is understanding. That is,
   the light from the light.

   Job says, God spake one Word ; this was his own conception of himself :
   it was his Son. In this one conception he conceives all things ; he
   sees them as issuing from nothing. They are that in themselves. But as
   subsisting eternally in him, they are without themselves. What they
   were (without) themselves, was he him- self : God is nothing but God,
   for God is without other. All creatures are a light, for they are
   conceived in the light of unity

   and eternity. Creatures flowing forth as light reveal the hidden light.
   As St James says, Every good gift and every perfeet gift come down from
   above from the Father of lights.' We may deduce from this that all
   things are one light radiated by the Father for the purpose of
   revealing his own hidden light. And as all things have been one liglit
   proceeding forth, so also they are all one light which is flowing back,
   if they turn not away there- from of their own free will. Those who are
   steadfast in the face of multiplicity, behold wliat light and grace are
   revealed to them ! For the sovran good is so ordered towards the soul
   that she receives it not except by means. As St Dionysius says, The
   means is light : grace that illumines understanding.' What is
   understanding ? Understanding means seeing a thing quite clearly and
   without mistake. St Dionysius says, Disengage thy- self entirely from
   things if thou wouldst understand the highest good, God namely.' VVliat
   are wc to understand by God ? That he is the one power. Let us
   therefore unify ourselves so that this one power may energise in us. He
   is also the good which moves things towards their good, namely himself,
   albeit he himself remains unmoved. And lie is perfect simplicity ; and
   the simpler the soul is the better she understands his simplicity. How
   can we be perfectly simple ? By departing from things and from our-
   selves, and knowing our own mind and all the working of the powers of
   the soul, except the chief one, understanding : leave that to God
   alone. The passive soul stands to lose all this and leave God to work
   without hindrance ; then he begets his perfect likeness in her and
   conforms her to himself. Then she understands with him and loves with
   him. This is perfection. It is sometimes asked. Do we love God with the
   love wherewith the Father and the Son love one another ? Let us
   consider.

   Two kinds of love belong to us. One is the virtue. In this love we go
   on growing and any good we do in this love wins us eternal merit. But
   the love of the Father and the Son knows no increase for it is the Holy
   Ghost. Thus our love is as nothing compared with the love of the Father
   and the Son : it is the virtue that we grow with. The other love which
   is in us is the love of the Father and the Son. As St Paul says, God's
   love is poured into our heart.' In giving us his love God has given us
   his Holy Ghost so that wc can love him with the love wherewith he loves
   himself. We love God with his own love ; awareness of it deifies us.

   Intuition of the Sovran Good, that is God ! To have that is to have the
   life most worth of any creature. God is willing his own clear
   conception and his own delight. What is willing in the Godhead ? It is
   the Father watching the play of his own nature.

   What is this play ? It is his eternal Son. There has always been this
   play going on in the Father-nature. Play and audience are the same. The
   Father's view of his own nature is his Son. The Father embraces his own
   nature in the quiet darkness of his eternal essence which is known to
   none except himself. The glance returned by his own nature is his
   eternal Son. So the Son embraces the Father in his nature for he is the
   same as his Father in his nature. Thus from the Father's embrace of his
   own nature there comes this eternal playing of the Son. This play was
   played eternally before all creatures. As it is written in the Book of
   Wisdom, Prior to creatures, in the eternal now, I have played before
   the Father in his eternal stillness.' The Son has eternally been
   playing before the Father as the Father has before his Son. The playing
   of the twain is the Holy Ghost in whom they both disport themselves and
   he disports himself in both. Sport and players are the same. Their
   nature proceeding in itself. God is a fountain flowing into itself,' as
   St Dionysius says. The Father has eternally been loving himself in his
   Son just as the Son has been loving himself in the Father eternally.
   Their mutual love is the Holy Ghost : the third Person, who proceeds
   from the other two as love. The essence of the Godhead begets not. The
   Father's Person begets the Person of the Son eternally and together
   they pour forth their Holy Ghost : their mutual love. Father and Son
   are the pouring-in and the Holy Breath is the thing inpoured, identical
   in nature Avith them both. Did the essence of the Deity beget there
   would be more than one essence ; but there is not. There is one essence
   which gives all things life and being, for the Son is born out of the
   heart of the Father eternally and shall bring back into it again all
   things which issued forth therefrom in him. As (Christ declares, When I
   am exalted I will draw all things to me.' The Floly Ghost proceeded
   forth as love to make our spirits one with him. The Son takes back with
   him all the things that issued forth in him and the Holy Ghost returns
   with all that he expired. St Dionysius says, Son and Holy Spirit are
   the light of the God-bearing Godhead.' St Philip cried, Lord, show us
   the Father and wc shall be satisfied.' Our Lord answered and said,
   Philip, he who seeth me seeth my lather.' The Son revealed the
   mysteries of the Father for he was like him in all things and of one
   nature with him. Nothing satisfies the soul except the Father who is
   altogether good and absolutely simple. The more simple the soul the
   more like God she is. God spake never a word but one : his simple
   understand- ing. If the soul is to be simple she must withdraAv from
   multi- plicity into his one conception. That can happen here only noAV
   and then.

   The soul has three understandings. First, the understanding of things
   that are above her. Next, the understanding of herself. From this
   knowledge she passes to the third : the one alone. Therein she loses
   herself speaking never a word but possessing herself in silence for God
   has rapt ht^r up above herself to him ; she is not and knows not by
   herself. What she understands she understands with him and even this
   she must forgo, must leave to that wherewith she understands it. As St
   Dionysius says, Make thyself passive, void of definition. One single
   glimpse of the abstraetion that God is, more unifies the soul with God
   than all the works of holy Christendom.'

   Try diligently, therefore, to get some grasp of truth : in the
   conception of it thine own wont is altogetlier lost and thou dost live
   in truth. Those exalted ones who stand therein can never be disjoined
   from God. They are the blessed who know God in himself eternally. God
   is unchangeable, so these can never more be separated from him. It
   behoves us therefore to depart from all unlikencss to our highest good.

   THE JUST LIVES IN EI'ERNITY

   Justua in perpetuum vivet apud dominum est mersce cjus {Sap, Sie). We
   read to-day in the epistle the wise man's words, The just lives in
   eternity.' I have defined elsewhere what a just man is, but here I say
   in another sense, that man is just {i.e, righteous) who is informed
   with and transformed into justice (righteousness). The just lives in
   God and God in him, for God is born in the just and the just in God :
   at every virtue of the just God is born and is rejoiced, and not only
   every virtue but every action of the just wrought out of the virtue of
   the just and in justice ; thereat God is glad, aye, thrilled with joy,
   there is nothing in his ground that docs not dance for joy. To unen-
   lightened people this is matter for belief but the illumined know The
   just seeks nothing in his work ; only thralls and hirelings ask
   anything for work, or work for any why. If thou wouldst be informed
   with, transformed into, righteousness, have no ulterior purpose in thy
   work ; form no idea in thee in time or in eternity, not reward nor
   happiness nor this nor that, for verily all such w^orks are dead.
   Believe me, the idea of God in thee, if thou dost work with that in
   view, means death to all thy works ; they are good works spoilt and
   thou dost sin to boot, for thou doest like the gardener who first
   plants the garden and then roots up the trees but still expects a crop.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   throw away good work. If thou wouldst live and have thy work live also
   thou must be dead to all things and reduced to naught. It belongs to
   creature to make aught from aught, but God's idiosyncrasy is making
   aught from naught, wherefore, if God is to make aught of thee or in
   thee, thou must first come to naught ; so enter thou into thine own
   ground and work ; works wrought by thee there arc all living.

   He says, his reward is with the Lord.' lie says with, meaning that the
   reward of the just is where God is himself ; that the happiness of the
   just and God's happiness arc one ; the righteous are in bliss where God
   is in bliss. St John says, The Word was with God.' He says xmth because
   God is righteousness and the righteous are like him. Whoever is in
   righteousness is in God and is God.

   Further, with regard to tlie word, just. lie does not say, the just man
   or just angel, he simply says, the just. The Father begets his Son the
   just and the just his Son ; every virtue of the just, every act done by
   the just, is nothing but the Son being begotten by the Father. The
   Father never stops, he is always trying to beget his Son in me,
   according to the scriptures : For Sion's sake will I not hold my peaee
   and for Jerusalem I will not rest till the righteous is revealed and
   shincth like the lightning.' Sion is the height of living, the
   contemplative life, and Jerusalem the profoundest calm. Not for the
   most exalted life nor for the deepest peace will God desist until the
   riglitcous is revealed. God and God alone works in the just. If thy
   works are prompted by anything external, then thy works are dead. For
   thy works to be living it must be God that prompts them in the
   innermost recesses of thy soul : that is thy life and that alone.

   Further I declare : if it seems to thee that one virtue is greater than
   another, if thou dost cultivate it more and value it above the rest,
   then thou art not loving it as it is in righteousness nor is it God who
   is working in thee. As long as a man prizes or leans to one virtue more
   than to another he neither takes nor feels it as it is by rights, and
   he is not righteous. The just man loves and practises virtue as a
   whole, in righteousness, as righteousness itself. It says in holy writ
   : Before the fabricated world, I am.' He says, I am before, above.
   Meaning that in eternity, exalted above time, man does one work with
   God. People sometimes ask how man can do the work that God was doing a
   thousand years ago and in a thousand years will be doing still. They
   cannot under- stand it. But in eternity is no before nor after ; the
   happenings of the past milleimium and the future one and now, in
   eternity arc all the same. God's doings of a thousand years ago and now
   and a thousand years to come are but one single act. It follows that

   the man who is exalted above time into eternity will do with God what
   he did in the past and also what he does in the next thousand years.
   This is matter of knowledge to the wise and of belief to fools.

   St Paul says, We are eternally chosen in the Son and we should never
   rest until we get to be what wc have been in him eternally.' The Father
   ceaselessly endeavours to get us born in his Son so that we may be the
   same as his Son is. The Father is begetting his Son, and in his
   begetting the Father finds so much peace and pleasure that his entire
   nature is expended in it. That which is in God moves him to beget ; by
   his ground, his nature and his essence the Father is moved to
   generation. And you must know, God is born in us as soon as all our
   soul-powers, which hitherto have been tied and bound, are absolutely
   free (and passive) and when the mind is stilled and sense troubles us
   no longer. Then the Father begets in us his Son. Then wc keep as free
   from forms and images as God, and find ourselves as free from likeness
   as God is void and free in his very self. When the Father bears his Son
   in us we shall know the Father with the Son and the Holy Ghost in both
   of them and the holy Trinity, and therein all things as a mere naught
   in God. Then time and number are no more. God's essence neither does
   nor suffers, nor does his nature suffer, but it works.

   Sometimes a light is apparent in the soul and she fondly thinks it is
   the Son, whereas it is nothing but a light. When the Son reveals
   himself within the soul the love of the Holy Ghost is revealed at the
   same time. It is the nature of the Father to beget his Son, and it is
   of the nature of the Son for me to be begotten in him and in his nature
   ; it is of the nature of the Holy Breath for me to be consumed therein
   and melted and reduced entirely to love. One who is thus in love and
   altogether love, will think that God loves none but him and knows no
   love for anyone nor yet from anyone but him alone.

   Some doctors hold that the spirit finds its beatitude in love. Some
   make him find it in behohling God. I say he finds it not in love nor in
   gnosis nor in vision. But, it may be asked, has the spirit in eternal
   life no vision of God ? Yes and no. Once born he neither sees nor pays
   heed to God. But in being born he does see God. The spirit is in bliss
   then, not in its begetting but as being begotten, for then it lives as
   the Father lives, impartible, in its abstract and essential nature.
   Wherefore do thou turn from things and realize thyself in thy naked
   essence, for outside essence all is accident and the accidental makes
   for why. Let us live in the eternal, So help us God. Amen.

   LIKES LOVE AND UNITE

   Meister Eckhart says, Likes love and unite with one another ; unlikes
   hate and shun each other. According to one master, no two things arc so
   unlike as earth and heaven. Earth knew itself by nature alien and
   unlike to heaven. Wherefore it fled from heaven to the lowest place and
   there bides still lest haply it draw night at all to heaven. And the
   celestial nature grew aware that earth had fled and had possessed
   itself of the lowest place. And that is how the heavens came to empty
   themselves out into the earth in fruitful wise, indeed the masters say
   the broad expanse of heaven does not withhold a needle-point in size,
   it brings itself forth every whit as fruitfulness on earth. So earth is
   the most fruitful of all mortal creatures.

   Likewise I say about the man who has brought himself to naught in
   himself, in God and in all creatures. That man assumes the lowest place
   and God is bound to empty himself whole into his soul, else would he
   not be God. I warrant you by God's eternal truth, that into any man who
   is brought low God pours out his whole self in all his might, so
   utterly that neither of his life, his being, nor his nature, nay, nor
   of his perfect Godhead, docs he keep aught back, he empties out the
   whole thereof as fruits into that wight who in abandonment to God
   assumes the lowest place.

   To-day as I pursued my way pondering my discourse and wondering how to
   make you understand, I hit on an analogy. If yc can follow this my
   meaning W'^ill be plain and eke the drift of all my teaching. The
   analogy is with my eye and wood. My eye when it is open is an eye. It
   is the same eye, shut ; and the wood is neither more or less by reason
   of its seeing. Now mark me well. Suppose my eye, being one and single
   in itself, falls on the w^ood in seeing, then though each thing stops
   as it is, yet in the actual seeing they are so far the same that we can
   argue : my eye is the wood and the wood my eye. Now if the wood were
   free from matter and wholly immaterial, as my eyesight is, then we
   could truly say that in my actual vision wood and eye are essen- tially
   the same. If this is so with corporal things, then how much more with
   ghostly. Remember, my eye is far more one with some transoceanic
   sheep's that I have never seen than with my ear, albeit with this it
   has organic union. The sheep's eye works like mine, and therefore I
   impute to it more unity of action than I can do to eye and ear which
   have their different functions.

   I have often spoken of the light within the soul, which is un- created
   and eke uncreaturely. It is this light I am so often hinting

   at in my discourses, it is the light which lays straight hold of God,
   bare and unveiled, as he is in himself ; that is to say, it catches him
   in the act of self-begetting. Hence I can truly say this light is
   rather one with God than with any of my powers wherewith it has organic
   union. For know, this light within my soul i^; no better in its essence
   than the humblest, the grossest of my powers ; my sight or my hearing,
   for example, or any other sense which is the sport of heat and cold,
   hunger or thirst, seeing that essence is impartible.

   Now I maintain, if thou dost turn from thine own self and from created
   things, then in what measure thou dost this thou dost attain to unity
   and happiness in thy soul-spark ; a thing which is immune from time and
   space. This spark is opposed to creatures. It has no want but just God,
   God as he is in himself. Not enough for it the Father or the Son or
   Holy Ghost, nor even all three Persons, so far as they preserve their
   several properties. I trow this light would not be satisfied with the
   alone-begotten fruit of Deity. Nay, more, and even stranger to relate,
   I warrant you this light is not content with the changeless impartible
   essence of God, which neither gives nor takes, but wants to find its
   source ; it wants to get into its simple ground, into the silent desert
   whcrcinto no distinct thing ever pryecl, not Father, Son nor Holy
   Ghost. At the centre, where no one abides, there this light is quenched
   in still stronger light, wherein it is more one than in itself, for
   this ground is the im[)artible stillness, motionless in itself, and by
   this immobility all things are moved and all those have their life who,
   rceollceted in themselves, do live the life of mind. May we too live
   this intellectual life, So help us God. Amen.

   THERE COMES FORTH A ROD OUT OF THE ROOT OF JESSE

   Egredietur virga de radice Jesse et jlos de radice ejus ascendet et
   requiescet super eum spiritus domini {Isaias Hi, g)- read to-day in the
   Mass that there comes forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and out of
   the root conies forth a flower, and on this flower there rests,
   reposes, the spirit of the Lord. Jesse means a brand, which is burning
   ; it signifies love in the abstract, where it is no more called love,
   where nothing adventitious exists, and in this ground where as yet
   nothing grows, it germinates just like, within the root, the coming
   shoot. The offshoot has three properties : likeness to what it shoots
   from, the nature of the same, and it is of exactly the same species ;
   thirdly, it is free from all attach- ments, simply an emanation. Thus
   the Son proceeded from the

   Father, as another Person with the Father, albeit in the Father
   essentially the same. Accordingly he says, Out of the root came a rod
   and on the rod came a llower.' My loving is a heavenly matter, for
   likes all end in same and the same is in the ground, and a thing that
   grows out of another is in every respect the same kind. An apple
   grafted on a pear-tree has the taste of both. It is not so here : this
   has the llavour of the one alone ; itself is not therein and yet it is
   therein. It could never come out were it not first within in the
   abstract, in brooding essence. The wine is in the vine : it is and it
   is not.

   I say concerning God's freedom that it yields no nature save one. God
   starts with the Son, and the Son is another than the Father who is
   power, and from them twain there blossoms forth the Holy Ghost. Our
   philosophers teach that the sun draws the flow'^ers out of the roots
   through the stem, tirnelcssly wellnigh and too subtly for any eye to
   follow. The soul, which lias no nature in her ground, the ground of
   love, where slie is love, emerges from this nature where she is stoied
   in God. VVhatcviH' enters this being has much the same being. At the
   coming of the bride he devotes himself to her and works with all his
   might within his ground, in his innermost, where naught exists, where
   activity stops altogether. The tree of the Godhead grows in this ground
   and the Holy Ghost sprouts from its root. The flower that blossoms,
   love, is the Holy Ghost. In this Holy Ghost the soul flowers with the
   Father and the Son, and on this flower there rests and reposes the
   spirit of the Lord. He could not repose had he not rested first upon
   the Spirit. The Father and the Son rest on the Spirit, and the Spirit
   reposes upon them as on its cause. What is rest ? St Augustine says,
   rest is complete lack of motion ; body and soul bereft of their own
   nature. One philosopher says, God's idiosyncrasy is im- mutability.
   That is, all creatures. Man as trans(;ending motion. Jesse means a fire
   and a burning ; it signifies the ground of divine love and also the
   ground of the soul. Out of this ground the rod grows, i,e, in the
   purest and highest ; it shoots up out of this virgin soil at the
   breaking forth of the Son. Upon the rod opens a flower, the flower of
   the Holy Ghost. We beseech the Lord our God that we may rest in him and
   he in us to his glory. So help us God. Amen.

   WHAT MANNER OF CHILD SHALL THIS BE?

   What manner of child shall this be ? The hand of the Lord is with him.'
   The hand of the Lord means the Holy Ghost, for two

   reasons. First, because work is wrought with the hand ; and next,
   because it is one with the arm and with the body. All human actions
   start in the heart, extend to the limbs, and are done by the hand ; so
   the seat of the soul being chiefly in the heart, in the heart is the
   mainspring of licr energies. Likewise it is the Father who is the fount
   and oi'igin of all divine activity, and the Son is represented by his
   arm ; as it says in the Magnificat, he hath shewed strength with his
   arm.' Divine power proceeds from the body via the arm to the hand,
   whereby is signified the Holy Ghost, even as the soul which courses
   through the body and in material things proelaims her ghostly
   properties. Wherefore we argue that the Holy Ghost is meant by the hand
   which wrought in this child.

   Now mark the state of the soul wherein God is apt to work. He speaks of
   a ehild, suggCvsting pure joy, an unblemished state. The soul God works
   in must be pure and clean. A master says, The eternal wisdom tarries in
   Zion, her rest is in that pure city ' ; Zion meaning a height and a
   watch-tower (or resting-place). Again, she must be withdrawn (rom
   mortal, impermanent things. And thirdly, she must be on the watch for
   coming hindrances. God comes out of kindness because of the love he
   bears to the soul. He has endowed her with a godly light, the
   reflection of himself, so that he may be able fri'cly to energise in
   her in his own likeness. Love cannot be without finding or making
   alike. Suppose I have bidden a man, unless he have gotten some liking
   for me, he will never willingly follow me. And so with the soul which
   follows God ; God's members must all do his bidding whether they want
   to or no. If they do it reluctantly, then it is painful to him ; no
   work is ever pleasant that is done without liking.

   No creature can do more than in her lies. The soul makes headway solely
   by the light that God has given her, that being her own, presented her
   by God as a bridal gift. God comes in love with intent that the soul
   may arise, that in love she may energise above herself. For love cannot
   be without finding her like or making alike, except in as far as God
   works in love passing soul. Soul does not ply the work of grace (since
   that is not her nature) till she is gotten yonder, where God is plying
   himself, where the work is as noble as the worker, his own nature, to
   wit. As with light, for example. In wood it produces its like : heat
   and fire, and the harder the wind blows the fiercer the flame. Now put
   love for the fire and the Holy Ghost for the wind : the stronger
   breathes the Holy Ghost the more all-consuming its fire, albeit not
   sudden ; it keeps pace with the growth of the soul. If the whole man
   were consumed at once it would not be well, for one niight live a
   thousand years and still go on waxing in love. Light

   acts upon flowers, making them grow and bear fruit ; in living

   ATONEMENT

   Manete in me {Joh. 15^); beatxis vir^ qui in sapientia morahitur (EccL
   1422)* Abide in me,' says our Lord Jesus Christ in the

   gospel ; and the other text from the epistle says, Blessed is the man
   that shall continue in wisdom.' Both mean exactly the same thing. Mark
   then what is required of a man to dwell in him, i.e, in God. He
   requires three things. First, to renounce himself and all things, not
   cleaving to aught that is grasped by the senses within nor abiding in
   any creature existing in time or in eternity. Again, he must love
   neither this good nor that good : he must love good for good's sake,
   since nothing is good or desirable except in so far as God is therein.
   Wc ought to love things no whit more than just as much as wc love God
   in them ; nor is it right to love God for his heaven's sake nor for the
   sake of anything at all except the good he is in his own self. Whoso
   loves him for aught abides not in him, but abides in the thing he is
   loving him for. If then ye desire to dwell in him, ye must love him for
   naught but himself. Thirdly, he must take God not as good nor as right,
   but he must apprehend him in his pure and virgin substance where he is
   apprehending himself. Goodness and right are the garment of God which
   is covering him. Do thou then strip God of all cover- ings : discover
   him in his vestibule bare, just in his naked self. So shall ye abide in
   him.

   Whoso abides in him thus has live things. First, betwixt him and God
   there is no difference at all, they are one. Angels arc many, beyond
   number, they can do nothing without number ; they arc numberless
   because of their simplicity. The three Persons in God, who counts as
   three, they, again, have number. But betwixt man and God is not alone
   no difference but no multi- plicity : nothing but one. The second is,
   that he is conceiving his happiness in that same virgin nature where
   God is conceiving himself and conserving himself. Thirdly, his
   knowledge is one with God-knowledge, and this knowing consists in
   co-operation and con-sciencc in God's operation and science, to wit,
   the actual energy and gnosis at work towards the end that God may be
   ever being born in man.

   How is God ever being born in man ? Look you. Suppose a

   man hews out and brings to light the divine form which God has wrought
   into his nature, then God's image in him stands revealed. Birth must be
   taken in the sense of revelation, the Son being said to be born of the
   Father because he reveals the Father as father. So the more and the
   more clearly God's image shows in man the more evidently God is born in
   him. And by God's eternal birth in him we understand that his image
   stands fully revealed. The fifth thing is that this man is ever being
   born in God. How can a man be ever being born in God ? Lo ! by
   revealing this form in a man the man grows like unto God, for the form
   of man is the same as the image of God whieh is God in every respect.
   The more he is like God the more he is one. So man's eternal birth in
   God we understand to mean ideal man refulgent in God's image, which is
   God in form and matter, wherewith man is the same. This oneness of man
   and God is a matter of likeness of form, man being Godlike in form. So
   when we talk of man being one with God and take him to be one with God
   by nature, we refer to the exemplary element in him which is on a par
   with God, and not to his created nature. When we look at him as God we
   are blind to him as creature ; remembering his deity we forget his
   creature-nature ; withal this same oblivion must not be construed to
   mean the negation of his created nature, rather the affirmation of God
   in him whom we are regarding as God. Christ, for example, who is both
   God and man : what time we arc considering his manhood we disregard his
   Godhead ; not that we are denying him his Godhood, we simply ignore it
   for the nonce. And hence the explanation of St Augustine's dictum, What
   a man loves a man is.' If he loves a stone he is that stone, if he
   loves a man he is that man, if he loves God -- nay, I durst not say
   more ; were I to say, he is God, ye might stone me. I do but teach you
   the scriptures. Man being all meet for God is conformed to, in- formed
   with and transformed into, the divine uniformity wherein he is one with
   God. All this man gets by abiding within.

   Now mark the fruits borne by a man when he is one with God : together
   with God he is V)earing all creatures and big with beatitude for every
   creature in virtue of being one with him.

   The other text from the epistle says, Blessed is the man that continues
   in wisdom.' He says, in wisdom,' wisdom being a feminine noun and
   feminine nouns denote passivity. Now in God we posit both action and
   passion, for the Father is doing and the Son is suffering, this being
   characteristic of born natures. Eternal born wisdom, wherein all things
   stand distinct, is the Son, and that is why he says, Blessed is the man
   that continues in wisdom.' Blessed is the man,' he says. Now as I have
   often told you, there are two powers in the soul : one is the man and
   the other is

   the woman. He says, Blessed is the man.' The faculty of soul we call
   the man is the chief power of the soul, wherein God is a naked light ;
   for nothing but God enters into this power and this power is ever in
   God : the man who has gotten all things in this power has gotten them
   not as being things, he has them as being in God. We ought to abide all
   the time in this power because in this power all things arc the same.
   Thus abiding in all things alike and knowing them all in God as the
   same, man possesses all things ; he has discarded their grossest part
   and has gotten them now in their good and desirable nature. In this
   wise he possesses them yonder for God in his own nature is unable to
   forbear, he is obliged to give thee everything he ever made and his own
   self to boot. Blessed is the man who abides all the time in this power,
   he is ever-abiding in God. May we abide at all times in God, So help us
   our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   THE SWIFT RIVER

   Fluminis impetus Iwtificat civitatern del : sanctijicavit tabernacu-
   turn suurn altissimus {Psalm 455). The sudden or swift river

   makes glad the city of God.' Here we must note three things. First, the
   swift stream ; next, the city it serves ; thirdly, the benefit it
   brings.

   The prophet knows not how to stem the torrent of the Holy Ghost. The
   Holy Ghost flows into the soul as fast as she is poured forth in
   humility and so far as she has gotten the capacity. He fills all the
   room he can find. Consider, next, what city it is it flows through. It
   is really the soul. A city is something enclosed and centred within.
   And so must the soul be whereinto God flows. She must be safe from
   outside alarms, her forces assembled within. According to St John, the
   twelve apostles were gathered together when they received the Holy
   Ghost. Even so the soul must be gathered and brought to herself in
   order to welcome this divine stream which fills to the full her cup of
   delight.

   I sometimes say, beginners of the virtuous life shoiild do as he does
   who describes a circle : the starting-point once fixed, he keeps it so
   and then the trace is good. In other words, learn first to fix the
   heart on God, on good and on good works. Great deeds performed with
   shifting heart profit but little if at all. There were once two
   doctors. One of them declared that the good man cannot be moved. The
   other disagreed. What I say is, the good man may forsooth be moved, but
   he cannot be

   changed for the worse. I trow the good man is not easily hindered. But
   if aught can worsen him he is not perfect.

   Thirdly, the good of it. Which is, the prophet says, that God is in the
   midst of her, she shall not be moved.' It is the soul he means. Soul
   would not that God wrought with her aught that is mixed with creature.
   Some things God does with help of creature and some unaided. If the
   grace which is a help and which is coming through my words could enter
   your heart without means, as though spoken by God, your soul would
   forthwith be converted and she could not help it. By pronouncing God's
   word I become a co-worker with God and grace is mingled in me, God
   speaking it through me, and since I am to you as the means, it is not
   received intact in your soul. But the grace which is uttered by the
   Holy Ghost itself is received direct and imprinted unaltered in the
   soul what time the soul is recollected into the single power which has
   intuition of God. Grace springs up in the heart of the Father and flows
   into his Son, and in their mutual love it proceeds from the wisdom of
   the Son into the gift of the Holy Ghost and in the Holy Ghost is sent
   into the soul ; and this grace is the face of God and is sealed in the
   soul by the Spirit of God, without means and unchanged, making the soul
   like God. This God does by himself unaided by creature.

   No creature is noble enough to help in this work ; God has not graced
   their nature with such excellence. But he can do it easily enough in
   his own perfect nature. God will not let a creature assist him in this
   work, so for the nonce he elevates the soul to a much higher level than
   lier natural habitat, where she is out of reach of any creature. It
   were well within the compass of an angel's noble nature, provided God
   would let an angel serve. But that would offend the soul for in that
   hour she disdains the slightest taint of creature ; even the light of
   grace wherein she is atoned would be flouted by the soul did she not
   know she cannot pass it by. After all, it is not natural to her, it is
   quite supernatural, her flouting at that moment everything that is not
   God, for God leads forth his bride out of creaturely values into
   hiinself and speaks with her in her heart, that is, he makes her like
   himself in grace. For this exalted act the soul must recollect herself.

   The powers of the soul arc filled full of delight by this pure infusion
   of grace. Grace is to God as the shine to the sun ; it is one with him
   and it carries the soul into God and makes her exactly the same as God
   and as such she enjoys God's perfection. I'o the soul that has gotten
   and enjoyed divine perfection all that is not God has a bitter,
   nauseous savour. Then again, the soul wants the highest of all, so she
   cannot abide aught above her. I say, aye, and I durst maintain, she
   cannot even bear God being

   above her and I can prove it thus. For if the soul were spirited away
   far beyond things to perfect freedom from them and came in touch with
   God in his abstract divinity, natheless she would never rest till,
   thrusting into that, he shall have drowned her in himself and drowned
   himself in her alone. What though God be far above her in nobility of
   nature, she cannot rest till she has gotten God, so far as it is
   possible to creature to conceive him. The greatest happiness in earth
   or heaven lies in likeness to God, which divine nature makes in the
   highest degree : to wit, the image of itself. And this is what the soul
   is striving for seeing no so^il can throughly follow God without having
   in her the image of God. It is for us to sec whether the grace we have
   received is every whit divine, whether it smacks of God's perfection,
   whether it is in common with and is emanating in his grace into
   whatever can receive it. Even so ought man to be flowing out into
   whatever can receive him. So help us God. Amen.

   THE JUST LIVE FOR EVER

   Jicsti autem in perpetuum vivent et apud dorninwn est merces eorum
   {Sap, 5 ^q), The just (or righteous) live for ever and their

   reward is with God.' Let us look at this carefully. It sounds quite
   trite and commonplace, whereas it is, in fact, a most remarkable and
   precious dictum. The just live.' Who arc the just ? One scripture says.
   That man is just who gives to each his own. So the just are they that
   give to God his due and to the saints and angels theirs and to his
   fellow what is his. God's is glory. Who are they that glorify God ?
   Those who having gone out of them- selves seek not their own in
   anything whatever it may be, or great or small ; who look for nothing
   over them nor under them nor yet beside them ; not mindful of
   possessions, of honours, comfort, pleasure, nor inwardness nor holiness
   nor of reward nor heaven. They have finished with all that is theirs.
   God glorifies them and they truly glorify God and render him what is
   his due.

   We ought to give the saints and angels joy. Wonder of wonders ! Can a
   man in this life give joy to those in life eternal ? Aye, surely.
   Marvellous, incredible to tell, every saint rejoices, takes ineffable
   delight in each virtuous deed, each good desire or inten- tion ; their
   joy no tongue is able to express nor any heart conceive, as I have
   said. And why ? Because their love to God is so immeasurably great,
   they hold him so right dear, that his glory is to them more than their
   happiness. Not alone the saints and angels, but very God himself is as
   much pleased thereat as though

   it touched his^pwn felicity and was vital to him, to his own delight
   and satisfaction. Remember then, even if we serve God for no other
   reason than for the exceeding joy of those in life eternal and of God
   himself, yet we ought to do so gladly and with all diligence. Also, we
   ought to help those that are in hell and succour those still living.

   A man of this sort is in one way just, but in another sense the just
   are they that take everything alike from God no matter what it is, big
   and little, good and bad, all the same, no more nor less, but one thing
   like another. If one thing is to thee of more moment than another then
   thou art unjust. Thou must be rid of own-will altogether.

   I was thinking just now : if God does not will what I do then I must
   will what he docs. Some folks always want their own way ; that is bad,
   that way lies sin. Those others are a trifle better who would like to
   do God's will and have no mind to go against it, yet when they are sick
   they wish God would choose to make them well. These people would have
   God, then, con- forming to their will rather than they to his. We
   condone this although it is wrong. The just have no will at all ;
   whatever God wills, it is all one to them, regardless of the hardship.

   The just are so set on justice that were God not just they would not
   care a fig for God ; they are so stauneh to right, so perfectly
   indifferent to self, they reck not of the pains of hell nor of the joys
   of heaven nor anything whatever. Were all the pangs of those in hell
   and all the pain borne or to bear on earth to be the fruits of justice,
   they would not mind one jot, so true they are to God and right. To the
   just man nothing gives more pain, there is no greater hardship, than
   what is contrary to just- ness, equipoise. -- How so ? --If one thing
   can cheer and another can depress, you are not equable ; to be cheerful
   one moment and less or not at all so in the next is uneven-tempered.
   But the devotee of right is so stable that what he loves is his very
   life, nothing can upset him, nor docs he care for aught beside. St
   Augustine says, Where the soul loves there she is, rather than where
   she gives life. -- Our text sounds plain and commonplace enough, but
   there are few who realize the actual meaning of it. One who grasps the
   import of justice and the just will understand all I have to say.

   The just live.' There is nothing in the world so dear as life or so
   desirable. No life so bad or hard but man would go on living. It is
   written, the nearer to death the greater the pain. But however
   distressful life is there is still the desire to live. Why dost thou
   eat ? Why sleep ? To live. Why long for good or glory ? That knowest
   thou right well. But wherefore

   live ? For the sake of living, albeit thou ignorest for what reason
   thou dost live. Life is so desirable in itself, we want it for its own
   sake. Those who are in hell in eternal pain have no desire to lose
   their life, whether fiend or soul ; their life is such a noble thing,
   llowing as it does straight from God to them. That is the reason why
   they want to live. What is life ? God's exist- ence is my life. If my
   life is God's existence then God's being is my being and God's is-ness
   is my is-ness, neither more nor less. They live eternally with God, on
   a par with him, not below him nor above. All their works are wrought
   with God and God's with them. St John says, the Word was with God.' It
   was exactly like and side by side with him, neither under nor over but
   equal.

   When God created man he took the woman out of the man's side that she
   might be his equal. Not out of his head nor out of his feet did he make
   her, ix, neither man nor woman, but his peer. So the just soul is like
   to God, by the side of God, on a level with him, not under nor yet
   over.

   Who are they that are his like ? They that are nothing like, they alone
   are Godlike. God's essence nothing is like, therein is no image nor
   form. Those souls who are his equals, to them the Father gives as
   equals withholding nothing from them. All the Father has to give he
   bestows upon this soul, provided she is just and no more to herself
   than to another. Her own honour, her own profit, aught of hers, she
   neither wants nor thinks of more than any stranger's. Personal
   belongings are repugnant to her, alien and remote, be they bad or good.
   All love of this world is based on love of self. Leave this and thou
   hast left the world.

   In eternity the Father is bringing forth his Son just like himself. The
   Word was with God and the Word was God ' : the same in the same nature.
   I say, moreover : he has brought him forth in my soul. Not merely is
   she with him and he equally with her but he is in her : the Father
   gives birth to his Son in the soul in the very same way as he gives him
   birth in eternity, and in none other. He must do, willy-nilly. The
   Father is begetting his Son un- ceasingly, and furthermore, I say, he
   begets me his Son, as his very own Son. Moreover I declare, not only
   does he beget me his Son, he begets me himself and himself me : me his
   essence and his nature. In his nethermost deep I come welling up in his
   holy Breath, where there is one life, one being and one act. God's
   activity is one ; he begets me his Son then without difference. My
   bodily father is not my real father except for one small portion of his
   nature and I am different from him : he may be dead and I alive. My
   heavenly Father is my real father ; I am his and all I have I get from
   him ; I airi the son of him and of none other. Since the Father
   performs a single act therefore he

   makes me his Son without any distinction. As St Paul says, We are
   wholly transformed into God and changed.'

   Take an illustration. In the sacrament the bread is changed into the
   body of our Lord, and however much bread there is it becomes no more
   than the one body. Likewise were the bread to be changed into my finger
   it would make no more than the one finger. But suppose my finger is
   changed back to the bread, then the one is as much as the other ; for
   when one thing changes to another it is identical therewith. Even so if
   I be changed into him and he makes me one and the same with himself,
   then by the living God it is also true that there is no distinction.
   The Father gives birth to his Son without ceasing. Once the Son is born
   he takes nothing from the Father, for he has it all ; but while in the
   act of being born he is receiving from the Father.

   The moral of this is that it is not right of us to ask from God as from
   a stranger. I call you not servants but friends,' said our Lord. The
   servant asks, tlie master pays. I was wondering lately whether I am
   willing to ask or to accept anything from God. I must take earnest
   counsel with myself, for by accepting anything from God I make myself
   inferior to God, like a servant to his master, in respect of giving.
   That is not the case with us in eternal life,

   I once said here, and it is very true : When a man goes out of himself
   to find or fetch God, he is wrong. I do not find God outside myself nor
   conceive him excepting as my own and in me. A man ought not to work for
   any why, not for God nor for his glory nor for anything at all that is
   outside him, but only for that which is his being, his very life within
   him.

   Some simple folk fondly imagine they are going to see God as it were
   standing there and they here. Not so. God and I are one in knowing.
   When I take God into me in loving I am going into God. Some say that
   happiness does not lie in knowledge but in will alone. They are wrong ;
   if it were merely a matter of will it would not be one. Working and
   becoming are the same. When the carpenter stops working the house will
   stop becoming. Still the axe and stoj) the growth. God and I are one in
   operation : he works and I become. Fire changes to itself the fuel cast
   upon it, which is converted to its nature. The wood does not assimilate
   the fire, the fire assimilates the wood. We shall be changed into God
   so that we shall know him as he is,' says St Paul. And the manner of
   our knowing shall be this, I him as he me, not more or less : just the
   same. The just live eternally, and their reward is with God ' :
   identity with him, as I have said. Let us love justice for its own sake
   and God without a why, So help us God. Amen.

   PUBLISH THE WORD

   Prccdica verhum (2 Tim. 42 ). St Dominic says, translating the words of
   St Paul, Publish, proclaim, bring forth and propagate the Word.' It is
   remarkable that anything should come forth and at the same time stay
   within. That the Word should come forth and still remain within is very
   wonderful ; that all creatures should come forth and remain within is
   very wonderful ; what God gives and promises to give is most wonderful,
   it is incomprehensible, incredible. That is as it should be ; if it
   were comprehensible and credible it would not be appropriate to him.
   God is in all things. The more he is in things the more he is out of
   things : the more he is within the more he is without. I have often
   said, God is creating the whole world now this instant. Everything God
   made six thousand years ago and more when he made the world, God makes
   now all at once. God is in all things ; but as God is divine and
   intelligible, therefore God is nowhere so much as in the soul, and the
   angels if you will, in tlie innermost soul, in the summit of the soul.
   And when I say the innermost 1 mean the highest and when I say the
   highest I mean the innermost. In the depths, at the summit of the soul,
   they arc both the same. Where time has never entered and no form was
   ever seen, at the centre, the summit, of the soul, there God is
   creating the whole world. All God's creation of six thousand years ago,
   all his creation of a thousand years to come, if the world lasts so
   long, is wrought by God in the innem\ost recesses, at the apex of the
   soul. All the past and future is con- trived by God at the summit of
   the soul. The Father bears his Son in the innermost recesses of the
   soul and begets thee with his only Son, no less. But if I am Son then I
   must be Son the same as he is Son, and in no other way. If I am a man I
   am a man man- fashion. If I am the Man I am the Man Man-fashion. As St
   John says, Ye are God's sons,'

   Speak the Word, tell it abroad, pronounce it, bring forth and propagate
   the Word.' Tell it forth ! ' What is spoken in from without is a gross,
   objective thing. Tell it forth ! ' That implies that thou hast it in
   thee. The prophet says, God spake one and I heard two.' True, God did
   speak but once. His utterance is but one. In his Word he speaks his Son
   and the Holy Ghost and the whole of creatures, all of which are but one
   utterance in God. But, I heard two,' the prophet says. Meaning, I
   understood it to be God and creature. Yonder where God speaks it it is
   God ; but here it is creature. People fondly think that God became man
   yonder. No ; Gk)d was made man here as well as there, and he

   was made man for one purpose only : to beget thee his one-begotten Son.

   Yesterday I quoted from the Paternoster the words, thy will be done.'
   Better his will than mine. That I should do it, is what the Paternoster
   means. First, by being (oblivious or) asleep to things, ignoring time
   and images and ereaiurcs. Philosophers will tell you that being in deep
   sleep a man might pass a hundred years oblivious of creatures, time and
   images and yet aware of God at work within him. As the soul says in the
   Book of Love, I sleep, but my heart waketh.' So when all creatures are
   asleep in thee thou durst be awake to God's doings in thee.

   Labour in all things ' says our text, and this is open to three
   interpretations. It means, turn all to good account, or, see God in
   everything, for God is everywhere. St Augustine says, God created all
   things not that he might leave them and go on his own way : no, he is
   still in them. People imagine they have more if they have' things plus
   God than if they have God without the things. They are mistaken. All
   things plus God amount to nothing more than God alone ; and he who
   fondly weens that if he has the Son and tJie Father wdth him he has
   more than if he had the Son without the Father, is mistaken too. The
   Father plus the Son is no more than the Son is by himself and the Son
   plus the Father is no more than the Father by himself. To find God in
   all things is a sign that he has begotten thee his only Son, no less.

   Again, turn everything to good account, means, love God the same in
   poverty as wealth, hold him as dear in sickness as in health ; as dear
   in trials and in sufferings as in immunity from sufferings. The heavier
   to bear the lighter to bear : like two buckets, the heavier the one the
   lighter tlie otJier, and so the more one gets rid the easier the
   riddance. The God-lovcr parts with the world as cheerfully as with an
   egg. The more he gives up the easier it grows.

   Thirdly, labour in all things ' means : where thou findest thyself
   about manifold things, at variance wdth pure and simple essence, let
   that be thy work : work in all things ' and fulfil thy destiny.' It
   also means, lift up thy head, and this is twofold in its implication.
   The first meaning is : part with all that is thine and appropriate God
   ; then God will be thine as he is his own ; he will be God to thee as
   he is God to his very self, no less. What is mine I get from no one. If
   1 get it from another it is not mine hut his from whom I got it. The
   other meaning is, dedicate all fhy acts to God. Many people cannot
   understand this, and I am not surprised ; to know the meaning of it the
   soul must be in

   THE POWERS OF HEAVEN SHALL BE MOVED

   Virtutes cadorum movebantur {Luc, 21 20 ). This is a gospel- saying of
   our Lord, and the translation runs, The powers of heaven shall be
   moved.' Heaven is suggestive of some mysterious or hidden thing, God
   being so mysteriously coneealed by the light of his divine splendour
   that no man may by dint of his own intellect attain to the beatific
   vision of his godly countenance. As Job exclaims, Who can by searching
   find out the things in heaven ? ' As though to say, no one in the
   world. The sage laments this, crying, Alas ! O Lord, thou art a hidden
   God ! ' According to St Augustine, God hides in the recesses of the
   soul, disguised in the workings of grace wherein he shows himself to
   the soul covertly, so that none may know except the soul wherein he is
   thus privily concealed.' And St Paul says, Everything, which is in the
   soul, is hidden.' The soul then is the godly heaven '^and ghostly where
   in unbroken stillness God does his perfect work. As God spake by the
   prophets, Behold, I create in you a new heaven.'

   It is the stirring of the powers of these incarnate heavens by the
   light of God's glory shining on them which Christ refers to when he
   says, The powers of heaven arc shaken.' These words betoken to us the
   good works of the soul whereto she is wont what time God being hid in
   her makes her the heaven of his incomprehensible divinity. For every
   act proceeds from power and power proceeds from essence. So from these
   words we learn three things about the noble nature of the soul. First,
   her transcendent being. |, (Thus he speaks of heaven,) Next, her
   powerful faculties. (Hence i j the word powers,) Thirdly, her fruitful
   operation. (Hence the ' word moved,)

   Now to begin with let us note that if the soul has got a heavenly being
   she must possess three heavenly properties. First, the innate eternity
   of heaven. Secondly, its motion in a circle... Thirdly, its overflowing
   into creatures underneath. These three! things I demonstrate as follows
   : The first, that heaven is eternal,

   I explain in this way. The heavens have an incorporeal, immaterial
   nature in corporeal guise. No outside semblance is admitted. Colour is
   excluded, and no variable force can ply therein, hence its state is one
   of fixed abiding. Then the circular motion of the ^ See also Spamer's
   Texte^ A. 6, for a longer version.

   heavens is argued thus. Anything that travels in a circle comes back to
   its start ; and anything that comes back to its start travels in a
   circle. Now the philosopher says the mover of the heavens is in the
   East where the sun rises. We see with our own eyes that every day the
   sun dawns in the East and sets into the West to rise again next day at
   the place where, the philosopher says, the mover resides. It returns
   each day to its start. Ergo, the sun goes round. This is not to be
   confused with the sun's own period of revolution. The starting-point of
   its own path is not reached in one day : it takes it a whole year,
   three hundred and sixty-five days, that is to say. Rather we must take
   this as referring to the heavens altogether, with the sun in their
   train. The sun doing yearly what they accomplish daily. Thirdly, the
   heavenly downpour into creatures I argue from the fact that everything
   subject to birth and decay is unstable and lacking in celestial power.
   As the philosopher observes in the book of The Celestial Nature, Heaven
   is to all inferior things the influx of being and of life.'

   Now for the soul to be this ghostly heaven she must return to her
   eternal being, to the circular motion of her cause and to her highest
   nature streaming down into her lower powers. First and foremost let me
   say that as she goes it does behove the soul to turn to her eternal
   being and diligently note how by God's grace she is immortal in her
   nature which he has rendered meet to share in his eternal bliss. She is
   an incorporeal nature in corporeal ' guise, spirit not following body
   in its fleshly birth, so no extrane- ous semblance can invade her,
   provided she is ever on her guard against the fading of her own
   exemplar wherein she is reflecting and manifesting God in his own
   proper nature. Nor may she brook the entrance of any naughtiness to
   oust her from her heavenly perfection and cast her into suffering, for
   she suffers without suffering in the power of God whereby she is
   fortified in suffering. Withal no other power can ply in her ; she is
   so secure in God who is immutable stability that neither death nor life
   nor depth nor height nor any creature can part her from his fixed and
   changeless deity. So with King David she may say, In cleaving to God
   lies the gift of immortal felicity.'

   Secondly, the soul progresses in a circle, for she rises with the
   rising sun, in her eternal nature, to wit, in her heavenly Father's
   heart, where there is ever dawning the true Son, his self-begotten Son,
   the light and shine of his eternal sufficiency. And she returns into
   the Father's mind where she is spoken in celestial wise, as the prophet
   hath it, God fashioned the heavens in his understanding.' This
   intelligible heaven means the soul returned intact to God as to her
   source. For he speaks into her his eternal

   Word, and confirms her in all heavenly perfection ; as the prophet
   cries on becoming the heaven of the Deity, By God's Word are the
   heavens, fixed and established.'

   Thirdly, this spiritual heaven of the soul drips divine grace and
   consolation. Just as the angel-mover rolls the heavens round and gives
   them energy, furnishing the heavens with the power of his might for
   heaven to pass on and thus supply all things with their being and
   activity and life, even so God dispenses to the soul his godly power
   with all its grace, which wells up in the Father's heart, so giving her
   the means of growing vigorous and strong in his own proper motion
   wherein she gives her being and activity and life to all her lower
   powers, to the members of her body and to all their operations, till
   they, grown living in God's eyes, do bring forth fruit of life eternal.
   This was the draught the prophet craved when, mindful that the Holy
   Ghost was troubling the deep waters of his heart and that his highest
   power was receiving and conceiving the dearest power of divinity,
   Isaias cried, Drop dew, ye heavens from above,' meaning to say, pour
   into all my powers, all my members, all my works, the sweet celestial
   dew which ye have gotten into you from God.'

   Further we must note how he has decked the natural heavens with seven
   planets, seven noble stars which arc nearer tq^ than the rest. I'lie
   first is SaMrn, then comes .Jiipiter, tfien Mars and then the Siiif ;
   after that comes Venus and then Mercury and then the Moon. Now when
   th&lt;i soul becomes a spiritual heaven our Lord will deck her with
   these same stars ghostly, as .John saw in his apocalypse when he espied
   the King of Kings seated upon the throne of the majesty of (Jod and hav
   ing seven stars in his hand. Know that the first star, Saturn, is the
   purger ; Jupiter, the second, the well-wisher ; the third one. Mars, is
   him of wrath ; the fourth, the Sun, the light-giver ; the lifth one,
   Venus, is the lover ; the sixth one. Mercury, the winner ; the seventh
   is the . Moon, the runner.

   In the heaven of the soul Saturn becomes angelic purity, bring- ing as
   reward the vision of God, as our Lord says, Blessed are the pure in
   heart for they shall sec God.^ After him comes Jupiter, the gracious,
   whose reward is the possession of the earth ; not the one we wear by
   way of body, nor that we tread on with our feet ; but the one we are in
   eager search of : that earth which ^is flowing with the milk of
   humanity and the honey of divinity. ^ Ht is of this our Lord declares,
   Blessed are the meek in heart for they shall inherit the earth.' Next
   follows Mars, of grim, determined nature and passionate suffering for
   God, bringing reward of the kingdom of heaven, as our Lord says,

   right-doing and of giving unto everyone his own ; and she being God's
   by creation and adoption docs therefore give herself to God withal.
   According to the words of our Lord, Blessed are they which do hunger
   and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled.' Then comes
   Venus, the lover, bringing reward of union with God ; as our Lord said,
   He that loveth me is beloved of my Father ; such conic unto him and
   abide with him.' From her, too, comes reward of consolation, since love
   sets the loving heart lamenting and mourning for her love. As our Lord
   says, Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted.' After
   her comes Mercury, the winner, directly the soul forgoes everything for
   God, bearing as his prize the palm of deity, including the kingdom of
   heaven. According to the words of our Lord, Blessed are the spiritual
   poor for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' Last comes the Moon, the
   runner, with her meed of happiness attained, as St Paul says, So run
   that ye may obtain.' Now the soul attains God best by running to him
   with a tranquil heart, for his abode is in peace. Our God chooses peace
   for his children, and his child is lieir to his eternal bliss, as our
   Lord says, Blessed are the peaceful for they shall be called the
   children of God.'

   Beyond these planetary stars there is the heaven where the fixed stars
   are which shine by night, the signals of the works wrought by the soul.
   In the night of the shadow of this world these shine before men,
   according to the words of our Lord, Let your light so shine before men
   that they may sec your good works and glorify your Father which is in
   heaven.' The other stars all get their light from the radiance of the
   sun. Venus as well, the love-star, which shines brightest of them all.
   Accordingly, the works we do arc pregnant most with power and brightest
   light when we have wholly gotten us the nalurc of the amiable Venus,
   star of love, whose nature is receptive to the sunshine of the true and
   intelligible Deity.

   which are heavenly inasmuch as they are capable of doing heavenly work,
   for every heavenly power is of the breath of the mouth of our God. ^ ^
   ^

   The first power receives, the second sees, the third love s. What time
   the soul is occupied in entertaining God, in seTfrecollection and
   intellectual contemplation, the love of her will transports her right
   into God. Then occurs that movement of the heavens, in the act of
   fecundation, which is latent in eternity. For the end of all motion is
   rest. As saith Isaiah the prophet, The heavens are moved and the earth
   withal and after the motion comes rest.' Now there is not perfect rest
   in intellectual vision, for in mental operations there is a certain
   motion of external things towards the soul, in virtue of which movement
   the forms of these same things are drawn into and pictured in the soul,
   starting a psychic motion in the isness of the soul and the real being
   of the things appearing in the picture ; and this motion extends to the
   will which is not at rest any more.

   Hence we see that in the starry heavens, the revolving heavens, God is
   none other than the mover, the starter, the source of energy whence the
   heavens get their power and their spin. And so too in this life he is
   present in the soul as the mover of our free will towards himself and
   towards good works, he being the fount of grace, which, from his godly
   heart, flows down into the soul.

   Beyond this heaven there is the motionless heaven, and this firmament
   is the abode of th(^ blest. In this heaven God is in all his felicity,
   engaged in the personal act of his eternal divinity. For the Father
   goes on begetting his Son in himself without ceasing, and Father and
   Son breathe forth with equal power their holy Breath, both Son and Holy
   Ghost abiding with the Father in the essence, and in the vision of this
   Trinity of Persons lies the whole happiness of creatures which are able
   to participate in his divine felicity. So the soul, having conquered
   the multiple heavens and possessed herself of their mysterious power,
   is plunged into the unity of the motionless heaven, called fire or the
   empyrean, not because it is burning but because it is enlightening, all
   who are in this heaven being ablaze with the cherubic light of divine
   love. The soul becomes the heavenly habitation of the eternal Deity,
   and he performs his godly work in her, whence she receives the nectar
   which is denied to such as have not reached this fiery celestial mind.
   For her heavenly Sire begets in her his Son whom she lures out of bis
   Father's heart, and Father and Son breathe into her their holy Breath,
   the Son never leaving his Father's heart but proceeding forth from his
   Father in such fashion that he ever abides in i^is Father's heart. Thus
   the Father dwells in the soul ; he clasps the soul to his breast, and
   in this embrace of

   the Father she conceives within her his Son as a proceeding Person and
   at the same time is aware of his presence with the Father in his
   essence. For thus saith the Father, I will lead her into the
   wilderness, into the solitude, and will speak into her heart.' His
   leading her into the desert, into the solitude, means making her void,
   deserted of creatures ; he empties her of corruptible things and says
   all he can to her heart. He can speak but one word, and that Word is
   eternal : it is his only-begotten Son. That is the Word he speaks to
   the soul, giving birth to his Son in her, and in this birth the Father
   and Son inspire her with their Holy Ghost which teaches her all things.

   Thus the soul gets all things from the Father and has gotten all things
   in the Son and knows all things in the Holy Ghost and so, possessed of
   all things, she is resting in God without end.

   THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND

   Sciiate, quia prope est regnum dei {Luc, ily^). Our Lord says. The
   kingdom of God is at hand. Yes, the kingdom of God is within us, and
   according to St Paul our salvation is nearer than we think. In what
   sense is the kingdom of God near at hand ? Let us consider this
   carefully. Supposing 1 were king all unbeknowest to me, then I should
   be no king. But suppose I have the firm con- viction that I am the king
   and everyone maintains and insists upon it with me and I know for
   certain that all the world is of the same opinion, in that case I am
   king and all the king's treasure is mine. Failing any one of these
   three things I can be no king. Even so our happiness depends on our
   knowledge, our awareness of the sovran good, which is God himself. I
   have one power in my soul fully sensible of God. I am as certain as I
   live that nothing is so close to me as God. God is nearer to me than I
   am to my own self ; my life depends upon God's being near me, present
   in me. So is he also in a stone, a log of wood, only they do not know
   it. If the wood knew of God and realized his nearness like the highest
   angel does, then the log would be as blessed as the chief of all the
   angels. Man is more happy than a log of wood in that he knows and is
   aware of God, how near at hand God is. The better he knows it the
   happier he is and the worse he knows it the more unhappy he is. He is
   not happy because of God's being in him and so near him or because of
   having God, but because he is aware of God, of his nearness to him ;
   because he is God-knowing and God-loving, and such an one knows that
   God's kingdom is at hand.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   Thinking upon God's kingdom, often I am dumbfounded at. its grandeur ;
   for God's kingdom is God's self in all his fullness. God's kingdom is
   no little thing : all imaginable worlds God might create, these make
   not up his kingdom. The soul God's kingdom dawns in, who is conscious
   of God's fullness, her none durst counsel nor instruct : she is by it
   instructed and assured of life eternal. He who knows, who is aware, how
   near God's king- dom is can say with Jacob, God is in this place and I
   knew it not.

   God is just as near in creatures. The wise man says, God has spread his
   nets and lines all over creatures, and we can find and know him in any
   one of them if only we will look.

   A philosopher says, That man knows God aright who is equally aware of
   him in all things ' ; and, To serve God in fear is good ; to serve him
   in love is better, but he who is apt to behold love in f( ar does best
   of all.' A life of rest and peace in God is good ; a life of pain in
   patience is still better ; but to have peace in a life of pain is best
   of all. One may go in the fields and say one's prayers and be conscious
   of God or go to church and be conscious of God ; if we arc more
   eonseious of God by being in a quiet place, that comes of our own
   imperfection and is not due to God, for God is the same in all things
   and all places and just as ready to vouchsafe himself so far as in him
   lies ; and that man knows God aright who ever finds him the same.

   St Bernard says, Why does my eye see sky, and not my foot ? Because my
   eye is like the sky, more than my foot.' For rny soul to see God then,
   she must be heavenly. What makes the soul alive to (lod in her, aware
   how close to her he is ? I answer : Heaven permits no alien intrusion,
   no mortal lack can pene- trate therein to do it outrage. And the soul
   that knows God is so firmly established in God that nothing can reach
   her, not hope nor fear nor joy nor grief nor good nor ill nor nothing
   that would bring her down to earth.

   Heaven is at all points equidistant from the earth. And likewise it
   behoves the soul to be equally remote from every earthly thing and no
   nearer to one than to another but equable

   i^y&gt; hi grief, in having and in wanting ; whatever it be she mUwSt
   be dead, dispassionate, superior to it. Heaven is clear and unsullied
   in its brightness, free from any taint of time and place. No corporal
   thing finds room therein. Not itself in time, incredible in swiftness
   is its revolution, its actual course being timeless though from its
   course comes time. Nothing hinders the soul from knowing God so much as
   time and place. Time and place are fractions, God is an integer. So if
   the soul knows God at all she must know him above time and space, for
   God is neither this nor that as these manifold things are : God is one.

   If the soul would see God she must not look at anything in time. While
   the soul is regarding time and place or any such idea she can never
   recognise God. Before the eye can see colour it has to be rid of all
   colour. Before the soul can see God it must have nothing in common with
   naught. The seer of God knows that creatures are naught. Comparing one
   with another, creature looks fair and is aught, but compare it with
   God, it is naught.

   Further I declare : any soul that sees God must have forgotten herself
   and have lost her own self ; while she secs and remembers herself she
   nor sees nor is conscious of God. But when for God's sake she loses
   herself and abandons all things then in God does she re-find herself,
   for knowing God she is knowing herself and all things (which she rid
   herself of) in God in perfection. To know the sovran good and the
   eternal goodness, really, 1 must know them in the good itself, not in
   partial goodness. To know real being I must know it as subsisting in
   itself, that is, in God, not parcelled out in creatures.

   In God alone exists the whole of godhood. Not in one man exists the
   whole of manhood, for in a single man exists not all mankind. But in
   God the soul finds perfect manhood and all things in their prime, for
   she knows them in their essential nature. The dweller in a richly
   furnished house must know far more about it than another person who,
   though full of information, has never been within. And by this same
   token I am as certain as I live, and as God lives, that the soul who
   knows God knows him above time and place. In this God -conscious state
   the soul perceives how near God's kingdom is, namely, God in all his
   fullness. There is much discussion among doctors at the School as to
   the possibility of the soul knowing God. Not by reason of his harshness
   docs God exact so much from man but out of his great kindness, wanting
   the soul to be more capacious, big enough to hold the largesse he is
   anxious to bestow.

   Let no one deem it difficult to arrive at this however hard may seem,
   and be, indeed, to start with, the parting from and dying to all
   things. Having once got into it no life is more easy, more delightful
   or more lovely. God is so very careful to be always with a man to guide
   him to himself in case of his taking the wrong way. No man ever wanted
   anything so much as God wants to make the soul aware of him. God is
   ever ready, but we are so unready. God is near to us, but we are far
   from him. God is in, we are out ; God is at home, we are strangers. The
   prophet says, God leads the just by a narrow path to the high road out
   into the open,' that is, to the true freedom of the spirit become one
   spirit with God. Ours to follow his lead and let him bring us to
   himself. So help us God. Amen.

   THIS IS A SERMON ABOUT OUR LORD'S BODY

   This is a sermon on our Lord's body by Brother Eckhart. He says that
   the bread of our Lord's body has many names, but three special ones are
   ^iven it in holy writ. In the first place it is called the heavenly
   bread, in the second it is called the bread of anprels, and thirdly the
   bread of lamentation. And whoso would worthily receive this bread of
   our Lord's body must have these three things. First, none can enjoy the
   heavenly bread who is not a heavenly man. This means that as the
   heavens with the sun and moon and the entire system arc above all
   earthly, temy)oral things, so man iti his desires, his senses and his
   thoughts must be lifted up to celestial things. Secondly, no man can
   enjoy the bread of heaven except he be an angelic man, for no creature
   was ever so perfect as an angel. This man must be at all times
   perfectly pure in heart and body. Thirdly, it is called the bread of
   lamentation ; this no man enjoys except he be a man of sorrow, one,
   that is to say, who pondering our Lord's martyrdom shall rue the
   treatment meted out to our Lord on earth. Whoso has not this rue shall
   not enjoy the bread of sorrow. So, then, a man must have three things
   before he can approach this bread. First, having gotten to the
   excellent condition of knowing good and ill, he must choose the good
   and worthy and reject the foul and evil. Next, with his heart divorced
   from worldly loves, this man must go in godly love and all godly
   things. Thirdly, he must order all his activities.

   inaccessible. Anything approaching this light the light consumes and
   turns to its own divine nature, even as I said of the divine essence ;
   what is taken into the essence is changed into essence. Speaking of
   understanding : as it is characteristic of God to subsist unmoved in
   his pure and virgin essence, his own being, so is this property imputed
   to understand- J^ing, which is so noble as to be selLsubsistent.

   I have told how understanding has to break through the image of the Son
   ; as he himself declares, I am the light of the world ; no man cometh
   to the Father but through me.' As the wise man explains in the Book of
   Wisdom, when the soul is borne into God by his divine wisdom, she is
   clarified and sublimed in light and in grace, all that is foreign to
   the soul being detached and shelled away together with a portion of
   herself. Further, I related how the soul, now throughly purged of soul
   accretions, is carried up and flows back into the Son as pure as she
   flowed out in him. The Father created the soul in the Son, so if wc are
   ever to get into the ground of God, into his innermost heart, we must
   take the lowest place in our own ground, in our own innermost self, in
   abject lowliness. When the soul enters into her ground, into the
   innej;: most recesses of her being, divine power suddenly pours into
   her, producing much activity, both' manifest and secret, and the soul s
   grows big and high in fiiydur with God. This is and must be in the soul
   who, rightly disposed in the ground of humility, ascends, borne aloft
   in the divine power : she never stops until she gets right into God and
   coming to absolute rest in him, abides wholly within without looking
   out, subsistent in his pure essence ; for even therein is the soul. God
   is pure being. The philosopher says that nothing at all can get into
   God, who is pure being, but what is also pure being. Ergo, the soul is
   pure being who has gotten therein, soaring right up into God. Amen.

   THE PROPHET SAYS: LORD BE MERCIFUL

   The prophet said, Lord be merciful to the people that is in thee.' The
   Lord replied, All that enter in will I make whole and love much.'

   I take the words of the Pharisee who besought our Lord to dine with him
   and our Lord's injunction to the woman, vade in pace ! It is good to
   pass from restlessness to calm : praiseworthy but imperfect. Go in
   peace,' be not disquieted : God implies that we ought to enter into
   peace and continue in peace and end in peace. God said, In me ye have
   peace.' So far in God so far in peace. Is aught in God, it is in peace
   ; is aught out of God, it is without peace. St John says, Whatever is
   born of God over- cometh the world.' What is born of God seeks peace
   and ensues it. He that pursues the even tenor of his way and is at
   peace is a heavenly man. Heaven constantly rotates, in its motion
   seeking rest.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   The Pharisee besought our Lord that he would dine with him. The food a
   man eats is changed in him into his body, like the body by the soul.
   Body and soul are one in being, not in act, thus my soul is united with
   my eye in one mode, that of seeing. Even so the food a man consumes
   mingles with his nature as regards its essence but not its activity ;
   and the great atonement we are destined to with God shall be of essence
   not of operation. Hence the Pharisee's request that God would eat with
   him.

   Pharisee signifies a solitary, one who knows no end to detach- ment of
   soul. The more noble the powers the more they liberate. Some powers are
   far higher than the body and sufficiently aloof to shell off and detach
   completely. As the philosopher well says, What once moves mortal things
   never enters into them. Again, by being free and unattached the
   unlettered man may in love and longing receive wisdom and impart it.
   And thirdly, having no end means having no finality, no ultimate
   security until one is at rest and all unwitting of disquiet : until the
   soul-powers being fixed on God are wholly unattached. As the prophet
   cries, Lord be merciful to the people that are in thee.'

   One master says, Of all the exalted works God has ever wrought in
   creatures mercy is the most familiar and the most mysterious, his work
   in the angels not excepted.' In it the work of mercy is exalted to
   mercy as it is in itself and as it is in God. Of God's activity the
   first outcome is mercy ; not in the sense of his for- giving man's sins
   nor of one man's forgiving another ; his highest work is mercy in the
   sense that he initiates the soul into the highest and most perfect
   thing she can conceive in this world. In his bottomless ocean God is
   productive of mercy.

   The prophet said, Lord be merciful to the people that is in thee.' What
   people is in God ? St John says, ' He that dwellcth in love dwellcth in
   God and God in him.' St John says, Love unites, love initiates into
   God.' Haply it is accessory. Love does not unite, not in any wise.
   Satisfaction (or, enough) is not what holds together, binds together.
   Love unites iq act uud^not in es§&lt;?n.Qe.. The best authorities aver
   that intellect strips every- thing off and grasps God bare as pure
   being in itself. Intellect penetrates goodness and truth, and, lighting
   6n virgin essence, it seizes God in the abstract as,.
   being..&gt;.without n^^ Neither *'knowledge nor love unites aught. Love
   takes God only as being good and God escapes from name. Good, love goes
   no further than that. Love takes God under a veil, under a garment. Not
   so understanding : understanding takes God as he is known in itself; it
   can never comprehend him in the sea of his own un- fathomable nature,
   Above biQtb jWiese pereeptwns^ ia^f^^ God energises as mercy at the
   summit and perfection of his activity.

   ST BENEDICT'S DAY

   IHlectus deo et hominibus etc. ( Eccl. 45i). In this passage from the
   Book of Wisdom the wise man speaks of (Moses), the beloved of God and
   men, whose memory is in benediction. God made him like the saints in
   glory.' And this may well be said of the saint whose festival wc keep
   to-day. Ilis name is Benedictus, blessed, so that to him are especially
   appropriate the words used here, cujus rnemoria in benedictione esty
   i.e. whose memory is in benediction, the more so as of him also we read
   that a glory was revealed to him wherein he saw the whole world
   gathered up as it were into a ball, and our text says, God made him
   like the saints in glory.'

   As to this glory. St Gregory says that to a soul who is in this glory
   all things seem small and narrow. The natural light that God has poured
   into the soul is so splendid and so strong that God's bodily creation
   is all poor and meagre to it. This light is more glorious than any
   corporal thing God ever made, withal the meanest, vilest corporal thing
   illumined by this light, which is intelligence, becomes exalted above
   mortal things. It is clearer and brighter than the sun and purifies
   things from both time and matter. This light' is so far-flung it vaults
   the boundaries of space. Wider than space, it transcends the great and
   good as God transcends wisdom and goodness ; for God is not either
   wisdom or good, but from God come wisdom and goodness. Intel- lect
   comes not of wisdom, nor intellect is not the outcome of truth nor is
   not gotten thereof as will is of goodness. Will wants what is good and
   is engendered thereby an(d (truth) is the issue of intellect not
   intellect of the truth. This light which flows out of the intellect is
   intelligence, which is like an outburst, an outflow

   or a stream as compared to what intellect is in itself. And this
   outburst is as far removed therefrom as heaven is from earth.

   There is another light, the light of grace, compared to which this
   natural light illumines a mere pin-point of the earth, nay rather a
   mere pin-point compared with the whole heavens which are incredibly
   more vast than all the earth. God's presence in the soul by grace is
   instinct with more light than any intellect can give : the light of
   intellect is but a drop in the ocean of this light, nay less a
   thousandfold. Hence to the soul who is in God's grace all things, and
   whatever her mind can grasp, will appear small and mean.

   I was asked the reason why virtuous folk who are in the good graces of
   God are so zealous to serve him. I said it was because they had tasted
   God, and it were strange indeed if, onee tasting and enjoying God, the
   soul could stomach aught beside. As the saint hath it. Once the soul
   tries God she finds the things that are not God repugnant and
   distasteful.

   Take the wise man's words in another sense : Beloved of God and men.'
   The verb is does not appear. He does not say : he is beloved of God and
   men, for he is not thinking of his changing and unstable temporal
   nature which the essence so far transcends. Essence is all-embracing
   and withal too transcendent ever to be touched by anything created.
   They that fondly think to have some knowledge of it know nothing
   whatsoever. As St Dionysius says, anything we know that we are able to
   impart or that we can define, that is not God ; for in God is neither
   this nor that which we can abstract nor has he limitation. In him there
   is only one thing and that is himself. Hence for theologians there is
   the burn- ing question : how comes this motionless, this intangible,
   solitary essence to be common to the soul, to be within the purview of
   the soul ? and they are greatly exercised as to how the soul receives
   it. I can only say that his divinity consists in the communication of
   himself to whatever is receptive of his goodness, and did he not
   communicate himself he would not be God.

   The soul God loves and to whom he does communicate himself must be so
   wholly free from time and from all taint of creature that God in her
   smacks only of himself. In the middle of the night, when all things
   were asleep,' the Scriptures say, thy word, O Lord, came down from thy
   royal throne.' In the night ' means when no creature peers into,
   appears in, the soul, and it is in this quiet, this inarticulateness of
   the soul that the word is spoken in her intellectual nature. This word
   is that of her own understanding : the expression of the Word as it is
   and abides in the intellect.

   Often I feel afraid, in discoursing about God, at how utterly

   detached the soul must be to attain to union with him. We durst not
   deem this unattainable : nothing is unattainable to the soul that
   possesses God's grace. To none were things ever more easy to leave : to
   the soul that has gotten God's grace things are all (easy) to eschew.
   Further I say, none ever had pleasanter task to perform : to the soul
   with God's grace all things are (pleasant) to leave because creature
   can cause her no pain. St Paul says, I am persuaded that no creature
   can separate us from God ; not fate nor life nor death.'

   Look you. Nowhere is God so really God as in the soul. In every
   creature is somewhat of God, but in the soul God is divine, for she is
   his rest. According to one master, God loves nothing but himself : all
   his love is lavished on himself. Marry, a fool were he only to take a
   penny who at one stroke could seize an hundred pounds ! God's love in
   us is the blossoming forth of the Holy Ghost. One word more of this :
   God loves nothing in us but the good he does in us himself. In the
   words of the saint, Nothing is crowned by God excepting his own work
   that is wrought by him in us.' Let no one be affrighted at my saying
   that God loves none beside himself ; it is all to our advantage, for
   therein he has in view our highest happiness. He purposes to lure us to
   himself, to get us purged and take us to himself, so that with himself
   he may love himself in us and us in him. So he must needs, so far as
   our love goes, attract us to himself by every means he can, pleasant or
   disagreeable. God, despite himself, is ever hanging over us some bait
   to lure us into him. I never give God thanks for loving me, because he
   cannot help it ; whether he would or no it is his nature to. What I do
   thank him for is for not being able of his goodness to leave off loving
   me. To know ourselves, to be installed in God, this is not hard, seeing
   that God himself must be working in us ; for it is godly work, man
   acquiescing and making no resistance : he is passive while allowing God
   to act in him. Let us, waiting upon God, enable him to take us into
   him, so that becoming one with him he may be able to love us with
   himself. So help us God. Amen.

   promise of the Father which they had heard from his mouth for they
   should be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.'

   He speaks of the promise or pledge of the Father. To us as well was
   given this pledge of baptism in the Holy Ghost and of being received
   thereby to dwell above time in eternity. Not in the things of time is
   the Holy Ghost bestowed. When a man turns from temporal things and goes
   into himself he notices a heavenly light, a light that comes from
   heaven. Though heaven- descended it is under heaven. There is no
   satisfaction in this light, for it is mortal, they say that it is
   matter. Now iron, which by nature falls, will rise, against its nature,
   and hang suspended to a loadstone in virtue of the master-force the
   stone receives from heaven. Wherever the stone turns there the iron
   goes with it. Even so the mind, unsatisfied witli this infernal light,
   will scale the firmament and search the heavens to find the breath that
   spins them, the heavens by their revolution causing all things on earth
   to grow and flourish. Its spirit never rests content until it pierces
   to the coil, into the primal origin where the breath has its source.
   This spirit knows no time nor number : number does not exist apart from
   the malady of time. Other root has none save in eternity, where there
   is no number except one. This spirit, transcending number, breaks
   through multiplicity and is trans- fixed by God, and by the fact of his
   piercing me I pierce him in return : God leads this spirit into the
   desert, into the solitude of its own self, where it is simply one and
   is welling up in itself. This spirit has no why, for if it had a why
   the unity would also have its why. This spirit is in unity and freedom.

   Doctors declare this will is free in the sense that none can bind it
   excepting God alone. God docs not bind the will, he sets it free, free
   to choose naught but God himself, and this is real freedom. For the
   spirit to be incapable of willing aught other than God's will is not
   its bondage but its true liberation. Some people say. If I have God and
   tlie love of God then I am at liberty to follow my own will. They
   labour under a mistake. So long as thou art capable of anything against
   the will of God and against his law thou hast no love of God though
   thou cozen the world that thou hast it. One who is in God's will and in
   God's love is fain to do the things God likes and leave undone the
   things God hates, and he can no more leave undone a thing that God
   wants done than he can do a thing that God abhors ; just like a man
   whose legs are tied together, he cannot stray and neither can he err
   who is in the will of God. Someone once said, God may command me to do
   evil and shun virtue, but I am incapable of sin.' No one loves virtue
   without being virtue. He who abandons himself and everything, who seeks
   not his own in any wise but does all he does

   for love and without why, that man being dead to all the world is alive
   in God and God in him.

   Here someone may object, It is all very well for you to tell us these
   things, but we ourselves know nothing of them. -- That I also rue. This
   knowledge is so noble and so common, it is not to be purchased . for a
   farthing or a penny. A just mind and a free will, have but these, and
   it is thine. To abandon all things on this lower plane where they exist
   in mortal guise is to recapture them in God where they are reality.
   Everything that is dead here is life yonder and all that is dense
   matter here is spirit there in God. If you pour fresh water into a
   clean basin and, all being clear and bright, stand it in a quiet place,
   then, holding your face over it you see it at the bottom as it really
   is. That is V&gt;ecause the water is free from impurity and still. It
   is the same with people who in a state of freedom and interior calm
   envisage God in peace and quiet, and when they are able to see him just
   as well in turmoil and disquiet there is perfect equanimity ; but if a
   man enjoys him less in trouble and unrest, that argues him not equable
   (unjust). St Augustine says, When the days arc weary and the time is
   long a man should turn to God, where no such thing as long exists and
   things are all at rest.' The lover of justice is possessed with
   justice, and he is this virtue.

   Our Lord said, I have called you not servants, I liave called you
   friends, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.' And so may
   my friend know something that I ignore, yet have no mind to tell me.
   But our Lord says, All that I have heard of my Father I have made known
   unto you.' I marvel how some priests, and these with pretensions to
   eminence and learning, allow themselves to be misled into interpreting
   these words to mean that he shows us of the path only the bare minimum
   needful to our happiness. That is not what 1 hold ; there is no truth
   in it. Why was God born man ? That I might be born God himself. God
   died that I might die to the whole world and all created things. And it
   is in this sense that w^e must understand the saying of our Lord, All
   that I have heard of my Father I have revealed unto you.' What does the
   Son hear of his Father ? The Father can only beget ; the Son can only
   be gotten. All the Father has and that he is, the whole basis of God's
   essence and God's nature, he brings forth once for all in his
   one-begotten Son. This the Son hears from his Father, this he makes
   known unto us, we being this same Son. All the Son has he has from his
   Father : essence and nature, we are this only Son. No one has the Holy
   Ghost except he be the only Son. Father and Son expire their holy
   Breath, and once this sacred breath inspires a man it remains iiv him,
   for he is essential and pneumatic.

   True, thou mayst receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the likeness of
   the Holy Ghost, but it abides not with thee ; it is impermanent. Just
   as a man may blush for shame, or blench, it is an accident and passes.
   But one by nature fair and ruddy is so always. So with this man, as
   being the only Son his holy Breath is of the nature of him. As it is
   written in the Book of Wisdom, This day have I begotten thee in the
   reflection of my eternal light, in the fullness of the Godhead and the
   glory of all saints.' He is begetting him now, to-day. There is
   childbed in the Godhead, there are they baptized in the Holy Ghost
   according to the promise of the Father. After these days which are not
   many,' or a few, then comes the fullness of the Godhead,' where there
   is neither day nor night ; where things a thousand leagues away are as
   near me as the ground whereon I stand ; that is the fulfilment, the
   full enjoyment of Godhood ; that is oneness. While the soul secs any
   difference she is unjust ; as long as aught looks out, looks in, there
   is no unanimity. Mary Magdalene sought our Lord within the tomb ;
   seeking one dead man she found two living angels, but still was
   unconsolcd. Said the angel, Why art thou cast down ? Whom seekest thou,
   woman ? ' As though to say, Thou dost seek one dead and hast found two
   living.' Whereto she might have answered, That is the burden of my
   discontent, that I find two where 1 sought one alone.'

   While anything created can make a clear impression on the soul she is
   disconsolate. I say, as I have often said before, so far as the soul's
   created nature goes there is no such thing as truth. I declare that
   there is something beyond the soul's created nature. But certain
   priests cannot understand how there can be anything so nearly kin to
   God, so much the same as he is. It has naught in common with naught.
   Anything made or created is naught, but this is alien and remote from
   the made and the created. It is something self-contained, taking
   nothing from outside. Our Lord departed to heaven, beyond all light,
   beyond all understanding, beyond all human ken. He who is thus
   translated beyond light of any kind dwells in the unity. As St Paul
   says, God dwells in the light that no man can approach unto,' which is
   in itself the perfect one. A man then must be dead, must be dead
   indeed, devoid of any being of his own, wholly without likeness, like
   to none, to be really Godlike. For it is God's character, his nature,
   to be peerless, incomparable. May we be the same in the oneness of God
   himself. So help us God. Amen.

   ASCENSION DAY

   Expedit vobis etc. vado parare vobis locum etc. (Joh. I67, 142). When
   he was about to depart from this world to his heavenly Father, Christ
   said to his disciples, It is expedient for you, it is for your good,
   that I should go, for while I am with you the Holy Ghost the Comforter
   will not come unto you.' With these words our Lord consoled his
   disciples knowing full well that they were troubled because he had
   warned them of his ascension. Our Lord will not suffer his lovers to be
   troubled, for fear is painful. And St John says, Love casteth out
   fear.' Love is incompatible with fear and pain, for the waxing of love
   is the waning of fear, and when love is perfect all fear is gone. But
   at the beginning of the virtuous life fear is of use to man, providing
   him a thoroughfare for love. As the bodkin or the awl makes a passage
   for the thread and the shoe is stitched with thread, not with the iron
   ; and as the bristle's part towards the thread is to put it in as
   fastening while the bristle is withdrawn ; so, to begin with, fear
   makes room for love and love binds to God, whereas fear passes out.

   Leaving now this argument we turn to the words of my Latin quotation,
   the words of our Lord, I go to prepare a place for you.' Here we notice
   two things taught and proved by our Lord in his ascension. The first
   one is that the soul is by nature heir to heaven. God is her lawful
   heritage, for no one generates the soul but God. God made her without
   any intervention. Some doctors will maintain, perhaps, that the divine
   light pouring into the angels, the whole creaturely idea that God
   reflects into the angels before it is exemplified in divers creatures,
   that this divine light, this image in the angels, is what makes the
   soul. Not so. The soul does not permit of any meddling, any
   interference in God's activity towards her, but fresh and pure as this
   flows out of God in one unbroken stream, so docs the soul proceed from
   God. Most privily has God embarked and launched forth the soul, so that
   no one knows for certain what she is. One philosopher calls her a
   light, and that is well said ; for like the light streaming out of the
   sun and shining into all creatures so is the soul sent straight from
   God. St Augustine says, Since the soul is emitted from God she is
   nowhere at rest except in God. Another master says she is a spirit, and
   this is true in a certain sense ; God is a spirit, and the soul is made
   like to God, so she may well be called spirit, being to God as spirit
   to spirit. A third master dubs her a fire, speaking the truth in
   symbol, for fire is most lofty in its nature, ^ See also Wackemagel,
   No. 65.

   most theurgic in its operation, and it never rests until it licks the
   heavens. It envelops all the elements for being much wider and higher
   than the air, or than water or the earth, it must be sur- rounding all
   the rest. It comes next of all to heaven and revolves therewith. The
   air goes with it, partially, because of being dense, while water, which
   is altogether grosser, is unable to keep pace and runs behind. The soul
   is called a fire because, in her desire, she does keep pace with God,
   like fire with the heavens, for the soul cannot rest except in God.
   Some souls which are rather dense follow haltingly, as air lags after
   fire. And some, again, being downright gross, are, like water,
   earth-bound and incapable ojf keeping up with God but run behind ; for
   seeing or hearing some- thing good will stir them with desire to be
   good, so they do follow after ; like water drifting to and fro without
   a change of level, so are these people moved while abiding of the same
   mind as before. A fourth doctor calls her a spark of God's celestial
   nature, and this jumps with our theory of her heavenly origin. Where
   one clod falls, there, generally speaking, all earth would fall as well
   ; a single clod reveals the ground to be its rcsting-placc. And whither
   one spark flics to from the fire, that place is revealed as the
   resting-place of fire.

   Now we have sent one spark to heaven, the soul to wit of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, which shows the common resting-place of souls is nowhere but in
   heaven ; and herein we have proof of the entire soul being heavenly.
   The body, on the other hand, is made of the four elements, so its
   habitat is naturally earth. But the soul is in intimate union with the
   body, and they must ever stay together despite that the body is of
   earth and the soul a denizen of heaven. God found a wise solution of
   this problem, himself becoming man and going in his proper power to
   heaven, so that in him wc have already sent one clod of earth to
   heaven. And the whole earth likewise must belong to heaven, for
   Christ's resting- place is nowhere but in union with his Father ; and
   as God is three in Person so is he one in nature, they having one being
   and one life. Thus our Lord Christ shows us that our being and our life
   are eternal in divine union.

   The second thing oUr Lord has taught and proved by his ascen- sion is
   how we must prepare ourselves to follow after him in pursuance of his
   words, I go to prepare a place for you.' Just as, on those four
   grounds, the soul is called light, spirit, fire or a spark of God's
   celestial nature, even so man is lifted up or gotten ready also by four
   things finely symbolised of old in the prophet Moses, of whom we read
   that he gathered his flock together and drove it into the wilderness,
   into the backside of the desert,' and there upon the mount of God he
   saw a bush burning but unconsumed.

   Moses wished to turn aside and see this wonder, the burning bush which
   would not burn away. But the Lord called to him out of the bush, and
   said, Draw not nigh ; put off thy shoes,' under which figure we are
   taught four precious lessons.

   First, in the name Moses, for Moses being interpreted means, one taken
   from the water. So shall a man be rescued from instability, from out
   the tempests of this world.

   Next, that man's animal passions and desires must all be herded up into
   the highest power of his soul. Unless the soul is gathered up and
   lifted out of created things the Holy Ghost cannot enter in nor
   energise in her. All divine work done by God is wrought by him in
   spirit, above time and place, for mortal things arc fatal to the flow
   of God. Divine light shed on spiritual creature will engender life, but
   if it falls on mortal things it fades, either dimmed or extinguished
   altogether. That is why our Lord declared, It is expedient for you, it
   is for your good, that I should go away.' For his disciples loved him
   as a man and mortal. Now there can be no doubt that our Lord was nobler
   than anything God ever made. If he then was a hindrance to his
   followers it is unquestionably true that other things we love, which
   are inferior to God, will hinder us much more. Ergo, the soul must
   transcend the world if she wants God to ply his godly work in her. And
   St Augustine says explicitly, we can transcend the world in love and
   knowledge, and that lacking love and knowledge we are nothing, i.e, in
   the world.

   In the third place we learn, that man can see and know God's work, but
   that while in this body he must needs stop short of actual attainment,
   just as Moses saw the burning bush but could not go right up to it ; he
   wanted to, however : a case of the love which docs not consume the body
   and has no spiritual potency.

   Fourthly, putting off the shoes signifies the freeing of the soul's
   desire, its withdrawal from all mortal and perishable things. To this
   and things still higher, O God help us. Amen.

   Expedit vobis ut ego vordam etc. {Joh. I67). We read in the gospel how
   our Lord said to his disciples, It is expedient for you that I go away.
   For if I go not away ye cannot receive the Holy Ghost.' And this by
   reason of three hindrances which beset three kinds of people. First,
   sinners who let creatures hinder them, using them

   [Picture 214]

   ungodly for their pleasure. These people are wandering in God's way,
   for creatures are a way of God. Hence St Augustine's dictum, Cursed be
   they that wander in the way of God.' I will say no more of these ;
   following their animal passions they are divorced from God. Also, there
   are good people who are over- busy with their material wants and take
   too much pleasure in externals. Concerning them God said, He that
   loveth his soul shall lose it ' (loveth carnally, that is :
   over-fondness, for it will lose a man his soul) and he that hateth his
   soul shall keep it unto life eternal.' Meaning those that follow not
   their inordinate pleasures and desires.

   A second hindrance blocks the path of other good and truly pious
   people. Namely, the seven sacraments. Sacr amentum means a sign. That
   man never gets to the underlying truth who stops at the enjoyment of
   its symbol ; and the seven sacraments all point us to the same reality.
   Marriage (for example) is a symbol of divine and human nature and also
   of the union of the soul with God. To rest in the illusion means delay
   in the attain- ment of real oneness. Ye durst not think of marriage as
   the mating of a man and a woman with each other for the indulgence of
   their outward passions and for the leading of a life of pleasure. That
   is not real marriage. Marriage means obedience to the marriage rule
   with its seven times and its works of mercy. Again, some pious souls
   are hampered with scrupulosity in the matter of repentance and
   confession ; they boggle at the symbol and neglect the thing itself.
   Our Lord says of these, He that has bathed needs but to wash his feet.'
   Which is as good as saying, Once purged by heartfelt rue and throughly
   shriven, a man needs not to re-confess old sins though he must wash his
   feet,' that is, his will and conscience : them let him cleanse by
   confessing daily faults.

   Also, some of the devout hinder themselves by over-occupation,
   outwardly, with the blessed sacrament of God's body, to the detri- ment
   of their receiving it ; these cultivate the rites at the cost of the
   reality, for the thing itself is inside not in its outward show.
   Wherefore they receive not God's body worthily. The sacra- ments all
   point us to the one and only truth, so we ought not to dally with the
   symbols but penetrate to the actuality. Those who follow the spirit of
   God's truth will worship him in spirit and in truth. So said Christ
   himself to the woman drawing at the well at Samaria when she asked him
   where to pray, whether on the mountains where her fathers used to pray
   or where the Jews then worshipped. Quoth our Lord, The hour cometh and
   is now, when true worshippers shall worship not only on the mountains
   and in the Temple but in spirit, in the place of God.' The moral of

   which is that we ought to pray to God not only on the hill-tops and in
   churches, but we ought always to be praying, at all times and
   everywhere. St Paul says, Rejoice evermore ; in everything give thanks
   ; pray without ceasing.' Even so pray they whose every deed is done
   like-mindedly for the love of God ; who, careless of their personal
   pleasure, bow themselves humbly before God and leave him alone to act.
   The prayer of the lips was enjoined by holy Christendom for the
   recalling of the soul from her outward senses wherein she dissipates
   herself in a multiplicity of perishable things. Being recollected
   thence into her highest power {i.e, know- ledge and memory and will)
   she is turned to spirit, and when the spirit is joined to God in
   perfect unity of will, it is turned to God. Then, not till then, he is
   in true prayer, when he has reached the goal of his creation ; for wc
   were created solely to be God, and that is the reason why we were
   fashioned like him. Whoso does not attain to being one with God in
   spirit is not a really spiritual man.

   Good, pious souls are hindered too from their proper object by
   lingering with holy joy over the human form of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
   and by the same token, over-reliance upon visions is a pitfall to some
   people ; they see things pictured in the mind, it may be man or angel
   or the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and give credence to their
   ghostly messages. They hear, perhaps, that they are best-beloved or
   about the faults or virtues of another ; or they may hear that God is
   doing something for them. In this they are deceived. God never does a
   single thing for creature but only by reason of his kindness, for he is
   the end of every Christian prayer: Do this, O Lord, for the sake of thy
   only Son Christ Jesus.' He himself said to his disciples, It is
   expedient for you that I should go away.' Here he was addressing not
   alone his then disciples but all his disciples of the future who
   purpose to follow him to high achievement. To them his manhood is a
   hindrance so long as they still cling to it with mortal pleasure ; they
   ought to follow God in all his ways and not keep solely to his way of
   manhood who reveals to us the way of Godhood ; for verily Christ said,
   I am the way, the truth and the life. No man cometh to the Father but
   by me, and he who would enter by any other door the same is a murderer
   and deserves eternal death.' Such are those who claim that they
   themselves arc capable of good or that God docs things for them,
   whereas Christ even, stated he was not from himself : the Eternal
   Wisdom said about itself, He that created me reposes in my tent,' who
   withal is uncreated for God is unborn wisdom. We may take this as
   referring to eternal wisdom's birth, for the Son proceeded forth by way
   of birth, where birth is the same thing as creation. The eternal wisdom
   was born of the power of the Father. He and the

   Son, his wisdom, and the Holy Ghost, his goodness and their mutual
   love, these (three) are one in nature and distinct in Person. And what
   is this tent that Wisdom talks of ? That is the manhood of Christ
   Jesus, wherein the Father reposes with his Son, they being of one
   nature, God in their Person as well as God by nature. This tent of
   humanity let us adore only in its oneness with the Godhead : for man is
   truly God and God is truly man. Let us not encumber ourselves with any
   creature excepting Jesus Christ, who only is our help and the way to
   his Father. When, taking leave of creatures, we enter the true path,
   which is .Jesus Christ, we are not wholly blest albeit within sight of
   the divine reality ; for while we are in sight of, we are not yet one
   with, what we see. While we notice any thing we are not one with it.
   Where there is no more than one no more than one is seen : God is not
   seen except by blindness, nor known except by ignorance, nor understood
   except by fools. According to St Augustine, no soul can get to God who
   goes not without creature and seeks not God without likeness. And that
   is the meaning of Christ's words, Cast out first the beam out of thine
   own eye and then wash the mote out of another's eye.' For you must
   understand that anything created is likened to a beam in the eye of the
   soul, preventing divine oneness by the fact of being creature. And
   because the soul is creature she has to cast herself out of herself;
   she must east out all the saints and eke our Lady, for all of them are
   creatures. She must be quite naked and wholly unnecessitous. Thus the
   soul enters the union of the Holy Trinity. She is further blest by
   becoming one with the naked Godhead whereof the blessed Trinity is the
   self-revelation. In the abstract Godhead there is no activity : the
   soul is not perfectly beatified until she casts herself into the
   desolate Deity where neither act nor form exists and there, merged in
   the void, loses herself : as self she perishes, and has no more to do
   with things than she had when she was not. Now, dead to self, she is
   alive in God and the dead perish (in the tomb). Even so is naughted the
   soul entombed in God.

   Some people fondly ween that they have gotten into the Holy Trinity who
   have never got beyond themselves. Loath to leave themselves, they keep
   their selfish interests and pleasures and interior sweetness, all of
   which they have forsworn, just the same in thought and will. These are
   no disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ who never looked for sweetness in
   anything he did ; on the contrary, he said, My soul is sorrowful even
   unto death.' Meaning his most -lofty soul, and he was thinking also of
   his bodily life. This was sorrowful even unto death,' until a term was
   put to the conditions of our exile, until our death was dead. And our
   soul too is troubled even unto death,' until there dies within us

   whatever is alive there of own will, own interests and multitudi- nous
   will. When the soul is dead as to the life of her desires and selfish
   interests and is buried in God, then, hidden and unknown to any
   creature, she can never be troubled any more.

   Now mark the signs whereby a soul is known to have been taken into the
   Holy Trinity. First, it is vouchsafed to her that at the sight of the
   Holy Ghost her sins are blotted out and she forgets herself and things.
   In the next place, she has gotten a conception of the Godhead, namely
   the eternal wisdom of the Father, the knowledge and discernment of all
   things ; and she is bereft of opinion, hypothesis, belief, for now she
   knows the truth ; and whereas hitherto she has taken things on trust
   and learnt by wordy arguments and hearsay, now things presented to her,
   whether by men or angels, she need ask none about, like those with no
   notion of reality, who, when an abstract truth is revealed to them,
   will try to grasp it with their finite mind : a thing that is beyond
   angelic understanding. Whereupon they question others on the subject,
   propounding it in the material form in which they have conceived it,
   and these take it as they hear it, in a concrete sense, and so
   pronounce it wrong and contrary to the Christian faith. It is false to
   them, because they accept it at face-value, which they arc unable to
   see through. In this they are mistaken. Furthermore, the soul who is in
   truth translated into the Holy Trinity is immediately endowed by the
   Father's power and strength with the ability to do all things. As St
   Paul says, I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.' Now the
   soul works not, knows not, loves not ; but God is working in her,
   perceiving himself in her. According to the words of Jeremiah, Verily
   ye are God's in divine knowing and loving.' God help us to this truth.
   Amen.

   I GO TO HIM THAT SENT ME

   Vado ad eum qui misit me {J oh, IG^). I go to him that sent me.' These
   words have a threefold meaning. In the first place, Christ went to his
   Father in his manhood. In the second place, the soul of Christ went in
   the light of grace. In the third place, the soul of Christ went in his
   Godhead.

   About this saying, Thomas, Origen, Damascenus and Richardus hold the
   same opinion, and I hold it with them. What we say is, that Christ in
   his manhood went first through our manhood ; he has known all the wants
   that flesh is heir to, for he has been through every creature and set
   creature lower than mankind : the humanity of Christ has carried our
   humanity beyond the realm of creature, exalting our nature above the
   angelic nature in the unity of God

   and man. The manhood of Christ went also by itself without impediment
   of creature, for he alone was ever perfect in virtue at every point of
   time.

   In the second place, the soul of Christ went without means in the light
   of grace. In the light of grace the soul of Christ received four gifts
   which Mary his mother never did receive nor did any of the saints. The
   first gift of Christ's soul was wisdom, the knowledge of his end. The
   second gift was understanding, which his soul received on achieving
   virtue as distinct from means. The third gift Christ's soul received
   was that in all she did she remained unchanged. The fourth gift was
   that of doing nothing except in virtue of the love of God.

   In the third place, the soul of Christ went in his godhood ; he went,
   that is to say, in the personality of the eternal Word, for this
   eternal Person is essentially the vehicle of human nature. He also went
   the way of the three Persons of whom he is one Person. He went in his
   own nature to the Father-nature in the understanding of them both. And
   he went in the work of the Person of the Holy Ghost, who effects the
   union of human nature and divine Person. Touching Christ's words, I go
   to him that sent me,' Lincolniensis and Master Henry Augus- tiniensis
   tell us what he means by go.' I hold with Thomas and Gilbertus that by
   this word he meant to say, I go to release you from the straits whereto
   ye have been brought by Adam's transgression ; I go to set you free
   from the bonds of creature ; I go to him that sent me, in my
   understanding wherein I take you straight to him ; I go the way of my
   own nature, the way of my lordship, wherein alone I keep unto myself
   what creature has no part nor lot in. He went in essence and in nature
   ; he went to reveal in his own Person the essence and the life to
   creatures in separation ; for the Persons are God in their personal
   divinity according to their nature's unity.

   Here arises the question. Is the Person of the nature or the nature of
   the Person ? In answering this it must be borne in mind that it is the
   nature of the Persons to manifest the fruits of their own nature.

   The soul too goes to the Father. First, in the fixed intention to
   cumber herself no more with creature unless with the objective form of
   Christ. Secondly, she goes in responding to whatever calls God may make
   upon her. Thirdly, she goes in the sweet savour of divine love wherein
   suffering is no suffering to her. Christ ascended into heaven ; he
   ennobled his humanity by withdrawing it from time and establishing it
   in eternity. Lifting up his soul he gave her his essential self, the
   essence he is ever making manifest in his personal works. Further, the
   soul ascends flying with the feathers of the virtues, wisdom, prudence,
   strength

   and justice namely, for on these four virtues the soul is able to wing
   her way past time and past all creatures which exist in time. And she
   flies as well in the three godly virtues of faith, hope and charity,
   resting in the love that is God, wherein we behold the Father, Son and
   Holy Ghost.

   Now it must be remembered that three kinds of men see God. The first
   see him in faith ; they know no more of him than what they can make out
   through a partition. The second behold God in the light of grace but
   only as the answer to their longings, as giving them sweetness,
   devotion, inwardness and other such-like things which are issuing from
   his gift. The third kind see him in the divine light. Christ's
   disciples beheld God as the satisfaction of their longings, but they
   did not see him as one who longs to love. Philip said to Jesus, Lord,
   show us the Father and satisfy us,' as though to say. Lord, show us
   thyself as transcending creature, as the immediate entry to the soul
   which thou dost nature in her proper nature. Jesus answered, He that
   seeth me seeth my Father,' as though to say, Whoso seeth me unchanging,
   as well disposed towards them that would wound as towards them that
   show the wish to please me ; whoso seeth me apart from my humanity as
   the door into the soul, the same beholds my Father as energising in his
   personal power and I in personal wisdom and the Holy Ghost in personal
   goodness : having God means having all these three in the one essence
   of their nature.

   THE soul's place *

   Our Lord said to his disciples, It is expedient for you that I should
   go away, for while I am with you the Holy Ghost will not come unto
   you.' With these words our I^ord comforted his disciples after supper
   on the eve of his departure, knowing full well that they were sorrowful
   at finding he was going to leave them. Our Lord will not long suffer
   his lovers to be troubled. Fear is cruel and therefore incompatible
   with love. As a man gains in love he loses his fear. But at the
   beginning of conversion fear goes through the soul as the awl goes
   through the shoe in making a passage for the thread ; and even so the
   heart is pierced with fear of sin which is then followed and chased out
   by love. Our Lord's words to his disciples, I go to prepare a place for
   you,' teach us two valuable lessons of which we have the proofs in his
   ascension.

   The first one is, that the soul is by nature made for heaven and God is
   her lawful heritage. For God brought forth the soul ' A variant of

   alone in lineal descent and no man knoweth what she is. They say she is
   a light, for as the sunlight is poured forth in beams upon all
   creatures, even so the soul is the immediate product of the light of
   God. St Augustine says, the soul proceeds from God and returns to God,
   so she is not at rest except in him. The soul is a spirit formed in the
   likeness of God and agreeable to him as one spirit is to another.
   Philosophers, again, compare the soul with fire, a thing most lofty in
   its nature, most theurgic in its operation, which never stops until it
   licks the heavens. Fire encircles all the elements ; spreading much
   wider and higher than the air or than water or the earth it envelops
   all of them. It comes next to heaven and revolves therewith ; the air
   goes rather slower because it is more dense, and water being denser
   still is unable to keep pace and runs behind. The soul is called a fire
   because in her desire she can keep up with God like fire with the
   heavens, nor has she any rest except in him. Also, the soul is called a
   spark of God's celestial nature, and this jumps with our theory that
   the soul is intrinsically heavenly. For where one clod falls there
   earth in general would fall as well ; and thus a single clod of earth
   will betray the resting-place of the earth itself ; so too the spark
   which shoots out of the fire will indicate the resting-place of fire.
   Now we have scut a spark to heaven, namely the soul of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, which shows the resting-place of souls is nowhere else than
   heaven ; yonder they belong. But the resting-place of body, made up as
   it is of the four elements, is by nature upon earth, and yet God joins
   these twain to one another and fates them to remain together : soul and
   body for their mutual uses. Of this God found a wise solution, himself
   becoming man and going in his proper power to heaven, the resting-place
   of Jesus Christ being in union with his Father. And since God is
   threefold in his Persons and simple in his nature, they having one
   common life and being, it follows that the place our Lord Jesus Christ
   prepares for our life and being is that of eternal union with God.

   The other thing Christ taught by his ascension is what prepara- tions
   we must make for following him, pursuant to his words, I go to prepare
   a place for you.' Just as it is upon four grounds that soul is called
   light, spirit, fire and a spark of God's celestial nature, so wc must
   be prepared in four particulars. When Moses would have gone and looked
   at the burning bush upon Mt. Sinai God told him to put off his shoes,
   which teaches us four lessons.

   The first is in the name Moses, which means, taken from the water, and
   so shall we be taken out of instability, rescued from the storm of the
   world-flow. Next, all our animal passions, with their agitations, must
   be herded up into the very topmost, the ghostly

   power of the soul. Unless the soul is raised to a higher power, from
   temporal to celestial things, the Holy Ghost cannot enter in to do its
   work in her. The work God docs is wrought by him in spirit, and any
   temporal or mundane thing obstniets the flow of God. On this account
   Christ said to his disciples, It is expe- dient for you that I should
   go away,' for his discipic's loved him as a man and mortal, so that
   despite his being the most perfect good God ever sent or that could
   become, yet he was a hindrance to his followers by his bodily })resencc
   ; how much more then must gross temporal things be hindrances to us ?
   The soul must rise above herself and above this time if she wants God
   to do his work in her. However well we see and understand the act of
   divine love wc cannot in this body perfectly attain thereto any more
   than Moses could reach the burning bush. But wc must regulate our lives
   so as to get to Christ our Lord when time is done.

   HINDRANCES

   When the disciples knew their Lord was leaving them he said,

   It is expedient for you that I should go away, for unless I go away ye
   will not receive the Holy Ghost.' Three kinds of pco))le are hindered
   from so doing.

   First, sinners who by using creatures at their godless pleasure hinder
   their soul's beatitude. These are wanderers in the way of God.
   Concerning them St Augustine says, Accursed are they that wander in
   God's way.' I will not here discuss them further ; following their
   animal passions they turn their hack on God. Also, there are some who
   arc over- fond of ministering to their outward wants. Touching these
   our Lord .Jesus said, He that loveth his soul shall lose it ' (or, in
   other words, to pander to the body is to lose the soul), and he that
   hateth his soul shall keep it ' (meaning those that follow not their
   own inordinate desires).

   Secondly, a number of good people arc hindered by the seven sacraments.
   Sacramentum means a sign, and anyone who rests content merely with the
   sign will never get to the interior truth. But the seven sacred rites
   all point us to the unique reality. Marriage, for example, is a symbol
   of divine and human nature, an earnest of the union of the soul with
   God. And anyone who lingers in the mere illusion is kept from the
   eternal fact. It is no true marriage when a man and woman indulge their
   sensual passions and live according to their fleshly lusts ; married
   life involves keeping the marriage rule with its seven times and its
   works of mercy.

   Thirdly, mauy pious souls are hindered by scrupulosity in

   confession and repentance, the outward forms thereof, but they take no
   trouble about the truth itself. Jesus says of these, He that has bathed
   needs but to wash his feet ' ; once cleansed, that is, by genuine
   sorrow and confession, no man has need to re-confess old sins ; but he
   should wash the feet of his desire and purify his conscience by
   shriving from new faults. And devout souls are hindered too from
   spiritual attainment by indulgence in sheer physical enjoyment of the
   humanity of Christ. When our Lord said to his disciples, It is
   expedient for you that I should go away,' he was addressing not them
   only but all who in the days to come should try to follow him to high
   achievement. For these there is a hindrance in his manhood if,
   regardless of his Godhood, they content themselves with that. We ought
   to follow God in all his ways, not kec^p to his humanity as distinct
   from his divinity.

   The Lord Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life, no man
   cometh to the Father but by me, and whoso shall enter by any other door
   the same is a thief and a robber.' He also said he was not from
   himself. The Eternal Wisdom said, He that created me is resting in my
   tent ' and witlial is uncreated. Christ is the born wisdom and power of
   the Father. His wisdom is the Son and his goodness is the Holy Ghost,
   they being of one nature and distinct in Person. And this tent that
   Wisdom speaks of is the humanity of Christ wherein the Father reposes
   with his Son and with the Holy (rhost who are alike in nature and are
   God in Person. Wherefore let us worship this tent of his humanity
   solely in its oneness with his deity. For man is truly God and God is
   truly man. Nor ought we to encumber ourselves with any creature
   excepting Jesus Christ, who is our saving way to his heavenly Father
   and apart from whom there is no other way. But albeit we have taken
   leave of creature and entered the true path, which is Jesus Christ, we
   are not wholly blest. Though wc are in sight of the divine reality wc
   are not yet the same as what we see. St Augustine says. No soul can get
   to God who goes not minus creature to find God minus likeness. And this
   finds warrant in Christ's words, Cast out first the beam out of thine
   own eye then thou canst take the mote out of thy brother's eye.' Whence
   we draw the moral that any temporal thing is a beam in the eye of the
   soul and prevents divine oneness. It follows that the soul will have to
   cast herself out of herself and stand all bare of creature and wholly
   unncccssitous, for so she puts herself upon a par with God who, naked
   and unindigent of things, goes absolutely free from matter. Thus at
   length the soul enters the union of the Holy Trinity to be wholly blest
   when, casting herself into the desert of the Godhead where neither act
   nor form exists, she is

   lost to self in the rapture of reunion : as self she comes to naught
   and has no more to do with things than she had when she was not. Now
   dead to self she is alive in God. But the dead perish in the tomb. So
   perishes the soul as such, entombed in the desert of the Godhead. Of
   such St Paul declares, Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
   God.' According to Dionysius, burial in God is nothing but the crossing
   over into uncreated life. This crossing is beyond the ken of
   multitudinous knowledge.

   Such is the nature of the soul that where she is she is entire : where
   this nature exists it exists as a whole in each member ; and by the
   same token, God is in all places and in every creature, for what lives
   in the soul is none other than God. So leaving every- thing to him let
   her dcj)art from all that is not God nor rest until she grasps the
   uncreated God. So help ns our Lord Jesus Christ who, as though to-day,
   ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of the Father with
   whom and with the Holy Ghost he is the working of the Deity. Amen.

   THE IMAGE IN THE SOUL

   said, Let us make man in our image.' What

   is God's speaking ? The Father observing himself with impartible
   perception perceives the impartible purity of his own essence. There he
   sees the image of creatures as a whole, there he speaks himself. His
   Word is his clear perception and that is his Son. God's speaking is his
   begetting.

   God said, Let us make.' Theologians ask : Why did not God say, Let us
   do ' or I.et us work ? ' Doing is an outward act beseeming not the
   inward man. Work (*omcs from the outward and from the inward man, but
   the innermost man takes no part in it. In making a thing the very
   innermost self of a man comes into outwardness.

   When God made man the innermost heart of the Godhead was concerned in
   his making. A heathen philosopher says, God made* all things with
   wisdom. The Doctor says, The Son is the wisdom or love of the Father
   wherewith he made all things.'

   God said, Let us make man.' Why did God not say, Let us make manhood,'
   for it was manhood that Christ took ? Man and manhood differ. Talking
   of man we mean a person ; talking of manhood we mean human nature.
   Philosophers define what nature is. It is the thing that essence can
   receive. Hence God assumed manhood and not man. It is written in the
   book of ' See also Greith, pp. 99-104, etc.

   Moses, Adam was the first man that God ever made. And I say that Christ
   was the lirst man God made. How so ? The philosopher says, what is
   first in intention is last in execution. When a carpenter builds a
   house his first intention is the roof and that is tJic finish of the
   house.

   God said, Let us make man.' Whereby he gave it to be understood that he
   is more than one : three in Person, one in essence. St Augustine
   relates that when he was looking for the image in the soul he sought it
   in the outward man, and there he found four likenesses and three links
   and two faces. He found nothing of the image. Then he hunted for it in
   the inner man, and there he found one thing which answered to the
   simple essence in its simplicity and to the various Persons in its
   trinity of powers. He found two faces to it. One working downwards and
   the other upwards. With the lower face she knows herself and outward
   things. The upper face has two activities ; with one she knows God and
   his goodness and his emanation ; with this she loves and knows him
   to-day and not to-morrow. I love God to-day and not to-morrow. Now the
   image will not lie in her three powers, by reason of their instability.
   Another power is in the highest face, which is concealed ,* in this
   concealment lies the image.

   The image has five properties. First, it is made by another. Secondly,
   it answers to that same. Thirdly, it has emanated from it ; not that it
   is the divine nature but it is a substance subsisting in itself ; it is
   the pure light that emanates from God and only differs from him in
   understanding God. Fifthly, it tends towards what it came from. Two
   things adorn this image. One is, it is according to him ; the other,
   there is somewhat of eternity therein. The soul has three powers : the
   image does not lie in them ; but she has one power : the actual (or
   active) intellect.

   Now St Augustine and the New Philosophers declare that in this lies
   impartible memory, intellect and will, and these three are inseparatc,
   i.e. the hidden image answers to God's essence. The divine being ((xod)
   is shining straight into this image, and the image shines straight into
   God with nothing between.

   May God come into us and we into him and be united with him, So help us
   God. Amen.

   THE SPECULATIVE INTELLECT

   St Paul reminds us that we being planted in the likeness of God may
   attain to higher and truer vision. For this St Dionysius says we
   require three things. The first is, possession of one's

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS 197

   mind. The second is, a mind that is free. The third is, a mind that can
   see. How can we acquire this speculative mind ? By a habit of mental
   concentration.

   The soul has a ghostly spot in her where she has all things
   rnattcr-free just as the first cause harbours in itself all things
   immaterially. The soul has also a light in her with which she creates
   all things. When this light and this spot coincide so that each is the
   seat of the other, then, only then, one is in full posses- sion of
   one's mind. VVliat more is there to tell ? It means our outAvard man's
   farewell to all satisfaction in creatures and the inner man's being so
   meet for God that nothing arises within him that he would have changed
   : then, not till then, a man is self-possessed. This cannot happen here
   for, as tlic Doctor says, when this that wc are siicaking of befalls,
   the highest power of the soul secs God in her own power. As St
   Dionysius puts it. Then the soul is not called soul, she is the sovran
   power of God.

   The second thing is a free mind. Freedom means not being in any way
   bound ; our being as free and clear and unalloyed as we were in our
   first emanation when wc were loosed in the Holy Ghost.

   The third is the speculative mind. Herein the soul sees God. What does
   the soul see when she sees God ? Dionysius says she sees the one power.
   This unique power makes her one with it. She sees in him also the good
   passing good, embraeing all good things. He wants to entice us out of
   ourselves, to make us unwilling to stay in ourselves. As the heathen
   philosopher says. The arch delight, all delights excelling, attracts
   the soul out of all enjoyments into the sovran truth where all things
   end. And the same master says, Why arc we unaware of this ? B(*causc wc
   are bent on louver things. Supposing that we find ourselves desirous of
   God before all else, tlien God has touched this highest power. By this
   touch she is moved out of herself and into him ; not that she is moved
   by grace as one thing moves another, for she has no body to her deity.
   St Dionysius says that the motion of the soul is as in a circle, since
   she never varies from her centre.

   He says too, God is splendid, and this by reason of three things. He is
   clear, he is a mutual illumination, he is one and the same. What docs
   clear mean ? Free from admixture of body ; persisting in his purity or
   light-nature. According to the scriptures, the soul is sevenfold
   clearer than the sun. The sun is clear albeit a corporal thing. But I
   declare the soul to be an hundredfold clearer than the sun, for the sun
   is bodily whereas the soul is ghostly. And her surpassing clarity is
   due to the ascendency of spirit over matter. Now if the soul is clear
   like this then God must be infinitely

   clearer, for he created her, and the cause is more than its creature
   has.

   lie is also a mutual illumination, for all that is in God is God. And
   St Augustine says the Father and the Son shine into each other in the
   Holy Ghost, who is the tie between them. And the three hypostases,
   which arc the three Persons, have one nature, like three lights with
   one shine. So too with us there should be unanimity, all multiplicity
   focussed to the highest power and this sovran power cast into God there
   to abide without reflection.

   Thirdly, he is one and the same, this being characteristic of divinity,
   which is the same as unity. This is not said of creature, for it cannot
   be maintained of any creatures that it is from them- selves they have
   their being. St Paul says, What we have we have received from the
   unique good, God namely, from whom are all good things.' Things are not
   from themselves. That which is from itself and from which all things
   are, is God. It is expressly taught that God is one and the same. And
   it is for us to be like him. When we have parted from ourselves then we
   are not-being rather than being. May we, being planted in the likeness
   of God, attain to higher and truer vision, So help us God. Amen.

   THE SON OF THE WIDOW

   Adolescens, tihi dico : surge {Luc, 7^^). To-day we read in the gospel
   about the widow with an only son who had died. And our Lord came to him
   and said, Young man, arise ! ' And he sat up.

   By the widow we understand the soul ; her husband was dead, so her son
   was dead also. Her son we take to mean her intellectual nature. Our
   I^ord, sitting by the well, said to the woman, Go home and fetch me
   thine husband.' Not hers that living water which is the Holy Ghost ;
   that is vouchsafed alone to those who are quickened in their
   understanding. Intellect is the summit of the soul. It has fellowship
   and intercourse with the angels in angelic nature. Angelic nature no
   time can touch, nor can time touch the intellec^tual nature. Unless she
   lives in this her son will die. She was a widow. No creature lives but
   has some good and some shortcomings. She was a widow in this sense :
   intellect was dead in her, and with it perished also the fruit of it,
   the Son.

   Widow, in another sense, suggests abandonment, one who is forsaken.
   Even so must we abandon creatures and forsake them utterly. The prophet
   says, The woman who is barren, more in number are her children than
   hers who is fruitful.' So with the

   soul who travails ghostly : manifold are her offspring, instantly does
   she bear fruit. The soul that has gotten God is bringing forth fruit
   all the time. God must needs accomplish his work. God is ever at work
   in the eternal now, and his work is the beget- ting of his Son ; he is
   bringing him forth all the while. In his birth all things have
   proceeded forth, and so great is his pleasure in this birth that he
   spends his whole energy upon it. God bears himself out of himself into
   himself ; the more perfect this birth is the more docs it bear. I say
   that God is all one, he knows nothing but himself alone. God cannot
   know himself without knowing all creaturcis. God gives himself birth
   all at once in his Son ; he says all things in him. He says, Young man,
   arise I '

   God exerts all his power in his Son so as to quicken the soul back to
   God. And hell-torment really means the frequent lapsing of the soul
   fiorn the purpose of God's effort, which is, to bring the soul to life
   again. God makes all creatures in a word, but in order to vivify the
   soul the whole of his power is expended in his Son with intent for the
   soul to be brought back therein. In his birth she comes to life, and
   God bears his Son into the soul so as to quicken her. God speaks
   himself in his Son. In the word wherein he speaks himself in himself he
   speaks himself into the soul. It belongs to all creatures to be born. A
   creature without birth would not be at all. According to one master, it
   is a sign of the divine birth that all creatures are wrought in it.
   Hence his words, Young man, arise ! '

   The soul has nothing God can speak into excepting her intelli- gence.
   Some powers are too vile for God to speak to. He could of course
   address them, only they would not hear. Will as will is not receptive,
   not in any wise ; will consists in aspiratioji. So he says, Young man,
   arise ! ' The powers of the soul age not, they say. Not so the corporal
   faculties, which How ])ast and decay. The more a man knows the better
   he knows, and this ennobles the soul. But the corporal powers do not
   have this result, so his words, Young man, arise ! ' have reference to
   the noble powers of the soul.

   Philosophers define as young things which are near to their beginning.
   Man has perennial youth in his intellectual nature ; the more he is in
   his active (intellect) the nearer he is to his birth, and a thing near
   its birth is young. The first issue of the soul is her intellectual
   nature, next follows will and then all the rest of her powers. Now he
   says, Young man, arise ! ' The soul herself is one indivisible work ;
   what is wrought by God in the impartible light of the soul is more
   lovely and fair than the whole of his work in creatures. Yet foolish
   folk take bad for good and good for bad. To him who understands aright
   the unitiue work.

   of God in the soul is better and nobler and higher than the whole
   world.

   Above this light comes grace. Grace enters neither into intellect nor
   will. For grace to enter into intellect and will, intellect and will
   must transcend themselves. A master says, There is I know not what,
   wholly mysterious, above them,' meaning the spark of the soul, the only
   part of her which is God- receptive. Here in this minute spark, called
   the spirit of the soul, there occurs true union between the soul and
   God. Grace never did any virtuous work : it has never done any work at
   all albeit good works are the outcome of it. Grace does not unify by
   works. Grace is the inhabiting and co-habiting of the soul in God. Work
   of whatever kind, external or internal, is beneath it. All creatures
   are searching for the Godlike. The more vile they are the more they
   search outside. Air and water, for example, flow away, but heaven
   steadily goes round and in its course is bringing forth all creatures ;
   therein being godlike so far as in it lies. Moreover, in its motion it
   is seeking rest. Heaven never condescends to serve inferior creatures.
   And in this it is very much like God. God's birth of himself in his Son
   is denied to creatures. But heaven is striving after this act which God
   performs in himself. And if heaven does this, and also other creatures
   much baser than the soul, then it is thankless and shameful of her to
   make such scant effort to compass such things as resemble the works God
   does in eternity.

   According to philosophers, the soul can give birth to herself in
   herself and bear herself out of herself back into herself. In her
   natural light she works wonders ; she is able to separate one. Fire and
   heat are one ; in her intellect she divides them. Wisdom and goodness
   arc one in God : in her intellect wisdom is never envisaged as
   goodness. Why ? Because wisdom enters more into God. The soul brings
   forth in her God out of God into God ; she is with young in her very
   self, and this by dint of her nearness to God, of her being the image
   of God.

   As I have often said, image as image, ix. as a reflection, is an
   inseparable thing. Soul as living in the reflection of God has real
   union no creature can sever. Not God himself, not angels, nor any sort
   of creature is able to disjoin the soul who is in the image of God.
   That is true union, and therein lies true happiness. Various
   philosophers are in search of happiness. My verdict is, that happiness
   lies neither in intellect nor will : happiness lies above them both,
   and it is there as happiness and not as intellection, and God is there
   as God and soul as the image of God. May he unite us to him in this
   sense. So help us God. Amen.

   THERE IS ONE POWER IN THE SOUL

   Adolescens, tihi dico : surge {Luc. 7^4). We read in St Luke's gospel
   about a youth who was dead. And our Lord came and took compassion on
   him and touched him and said, Young man, I say unto thee, I command
   thee. Arise ! '

   Now you must know that in all good people God is present all at once
   and there is something in the soul wherein God lives and something in
   the soul where the soul lives in God, and if the soul turns outwards
   towards external things she dies and God dies also in the soul. But he
   does not die in himself at all and he is alive to himself. Just as,
   when the soul leaves the body the body dies and the soul lives on in
   herself, so (iod may be dead to the soul and be alive to himself.
   Andknow, there is one power in the soul wider than wide heaven, which
   is so incredibly extensive that we are unable to define it, and yet
   this power is much vaster still.

   Mark now. In this exalted power the Father is saying to his
   one-begotten Son, Young man, arise ! ' It is God, and the closeness of
   its union with the soul is past belief, for God is so lofty in himself
   that nothing whatsoever can attain thereto by under- standing. It is
   wider than the heavens, aye than all the angels, albeit one angelic
   spark is the cause of all the life on earth. Desire is far-reaching,
   limitless. All that mind can conceive, all that heart can desire, that
   is not God. Where desire and understanding end, in the darkness, there
   shines God.

   Quoth our Lord, Young man, I say unto thee. Arise ! ' If I am to hear
   God speaking in me I must be wholly estranged from all that is mine, as
   strange as I am to things under the sea, and especially from time. The
   soul is as young in herself as when she was made, for age as relating
   to her is an affair of the body, affecting iier use of its senses. As
   one philosopher observes, an old man with the eyes of youth would sec
   just as well as a boy. I made a statement yesterday which seems almost
   incredible, I said that Jerusalem is as near my soul as the ground I
   stand on now. Aye, in good sooth, a thousand leagues beyond Jerusalem
   is every whit as nigh my soul as my own body is, of that I am as sure
   as of my being a man, and to any learned clerk it is not hard to
   understand.' Know then that my soul is as young as when I was created,
   aye, much younger. And I tell you, I should be ashamed were she not
   younger to-morrow than to-day.

   The soul has two powers which have nothing whatever to do with the
   body, namely intellect and will, which function above time. Oh, if only
   the soul's eyes were opened so that her under-

   standing might behold the truth ! Then it would be as easy to a man to
   give up everything as to give up peas and lentils, aye upon my soul, to
   him all things would be but vanity. There are some who give up things
   for love albeit greatly prizing what they leave. But to this man who
   knows in truth, it matters not one whit that he should leave himself
   and everything, for anyone who takes this course has all things for his
   own in truth.

   There is one power in the soul to which all things are alike sweet ;
   the very worst and the very best arc all the same in this power which
   takes things above here and now. Now meaning time and here meaning
   place. This place I arn in now, suppose 1 went out of myself and were
   entirely empty, why then I ween the heavenly Sire would bear his only
   Son within my mind so clearly that my spirit would bear him back again.
   Verily, were my spirit as ready as the wsoul of our Lord .Jesus Christ
   then would the Father energise in me as perfectly as in his
   onc-begotten Son, no less, seeing that he loves me with the selfsame
   love wherewith he loves himself.

   St John said, In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God
   and the Word was God.' Now to luar this Word in the Father (where it is
   absolutely silent), a man must be quite quiet and wholly free from
   images, aye, and forms as well. A man must be so true to God that
   nothing whatever can gladden him or sadden him. lie must sec all things
   in God, as they are there.

   He says, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise ! ' Meaning to effect this
   thing himself. If someone tells me to carry one stone he may as well
   tell me a hundred if he is going to do it himself. If he orders a
   hundredweight load he may just as well make it a thousand if it is for
   his own back. And God will do this work himself if onl}^ we will wait
   and not resist. If the soul would but stay within, she would have
   everything there. There is one power in the soul and that not merely
   power but being ; and not merely being : it radiates life, and is so
   pure, so high and so innately noble that creatures cannot live in it ;
   none but God can abide therein. Nay, even God himself is forbidden
   there so far as he is subject to condition. God cannot enter there in
   any guise : God is only there in his absolute divinity.

   Then, the fact of his speaking the words, Young man, I say unto thee.'
   What is God's speaking? It is his working, and God's work is so noble,
   so sublime, that God alone can do it. You must understand then, that
   our whole perfection, our entire happiness, will lie in traversing and
   transcending all creatureliness, all time and all limitation and
   getting into the cause which is causeless. We pray thee O Lord, that we
   may be one and indwelling. So help us God. Amen.

   I HAVE CHOSEN YOU

   Ego elegi vos de mundo (Joh. 15^^). These words wliich I quote in the
   Latin are from the gospel of to-day, the feast of one of the saints,
   Barnabas by naTiic, who is commonly referred to in the scriptures as
   being an apostle. Our Lord says, I have elected you, selected you,
   chosen you out of the world, from all created things, that ye should
   bring forth much fruit and that your fruit should remain,' for it is
   very good to bring forth fruit and for the fruit to remain, and the
   fruit does remain if we dwell in love. At the end of this gospel our
   Lord says, Love one another as I have ever loved you ; my Father hath
   loved me eternally and so have I loved you ; keep my commandments, so
   shall ye remain in my love.'

   All God's commandments come from love, from the kindness of his nature
   ; did they not come from love they would not be God's law, for God's
   law is the goodness of his nature and his nature his benignant law.
   Whoso dwells in love dwells in the goodness of his nature : he dwells
   in God's love, and love is without why. Suppose I had a friend and
   loved him for benefits received and because of getting my own way, I
   should not love my friend, 1 should be loving my own self. I ought to
   love my friend on his own account, for his virtues, for his own
   intrinsic worth : 1 love my friend aright loving him like this. And so
   with the man abiding in God's love, seeking not his own in God nor in
   himself nor in any thing but loving God sim})ly for his kindness, for
   the goodness of his nature, for what he is in himself : tliat is true
   love. Love of virtue is the flower, the ornament of virtue, aye, the
   motJier of all virtue, all perfection and all happiness : it is God,
   for God is the fruit of virtue, and it is this fruit wliich remains to
   man. When a man works for fruit and the fruit remains to him he
   rejoices greatly. Sup])osc he has a vineyard or a field and makes it
   over to his man to work while keeping all the produce ; he may give
   into the bargain all the things thereto belonging and still be much
   rejoiced to have the fruits remain in pa)unent. Even so a man rejoices
   in the fruit of virtue ; he has no worries, no vexations, because he
   has made over himself and everything.

   Our Lord says, Whoso shall leave anything for me and for my name's
   sake, to him will I restore an hundredfold and eternal life to boot.'
   But if thou leave it for that hundredfold and for the sake of eternal
   life, thou art leaving nothing ; nay, so thou leave it for a
   thousandfold reward thou art leaving nothing : leave thyself, give up
   self altogether, that is real riddance. A man once came

   to me (it was not long ago), and told me he had given up a quantity of
   land and goods to save his soul. Alack ! I thought, how paltry, how
   inadequate, the things thou hast resigned. It is blindness and folly so
   long as thou dost care a jot for what thou hast forsworn. Forswear
   thyself, that is true resignation.

   The man who has resigned himself is so impartial, this world will have
   none of him, as I said here not long ago. The devotee of justice is
   given up to justice, seized of justice, identified with justice. I once
   wrote in my book : The just man serves neither God nor creature : he is
   free ; and the more he is just the more he is free and the more he is
   freedom itself. Nothing created is free. While tlierc is aught above
   me, excepting God himself, it must constrain me, however small it be or
   however (great) ; even love and knowledge, so far as it is creature and
   not actually God, confines me with its limits. The unjust man, whether
   he would or no, is the servant of illusion : serving the world and
   creature he is the bondman of sin.

   1 was thinking lately ; that I am a man belongs to other men in common
   with myself ; I see and hear and eat and drink like any other animal ;
   but that 1 am belongs to no one but myself, not to man nor angel, no,
   nor yet to God excepting in so far as I am one with him. All God's work
   he puts into his one replica of him- self, and though radically
   differing in their operation, (creatures) all tend to reproduce
   themselves. In my father nature took its normal course. In the course
   of nature I should be a father like himself. The tendency is ever
   towards self-repetition, towards the preservation of the species : it
   is every man's intention that his work should be himself. Any shifting
   or hindering of his nature and the result is woman : thus where nature
   stops God begins to work and to create ; for without woman there would
   be no men. The child as conceived within its mother's womb has shape
   and colour and material being ; so much is wrought by nature. That
   lasts for forty days and forty nights, and on the fortieth day God
   creates the soul in much less than the twinkling of an eye. Now ends
   the work of nature, all nature can contrive in colour, form and matter.
   The activity of nature goes out altogether, and as the natural energy
   is finally withdrawn it is restored intact in the rational soul. This
   then is the work of nature and the creation of God. In created things
   (as I have said repeatedly) there is no truth.

   There is something, transcending the soul's created nature, not
   accessible to creature, non-existent ; no angel has gotten it, for his
   is a clear (intelligible) nature, and clear and overt things have no
   concern with this. It is akin to Deity, intrinsically one, having
   naught in common with naught. Many a priest finds

   it a baffling thing. It is one ; rather unnamed than named, rather
   unknown than known. If thou couldst naught thyself an instant, less
   than an instant, I should say, all that this is in itself would belong
   to thcc. But while thou dost mind thyself at all thou knowest no more
   of God than my mouth docs of colour or my eye of taste : so little thou
   knowest, thou discernest, what God is.

   Plato, that great priest, who occupied himself with lofty matters,
   makes reference to this thing. He speaks about a light which is not in
   this world; not in the world and not out of the world; not in time nor
   in eternity : it lias neither in nor out. God the eternal Father, the
   fullness and the sink of all his deity does he give birth to here in
   his one-begotten Son, so that we are that very Son, and his birth is
   his presence within and his abiding within is his bringing forth. That
   remains ever the same which comes welling up in itself. Ego, the word
   /, is proper to none but to God himself in his sameness. Vos, the word
   implies your collective unity, so that ego and vos, I and you, stand
   for unity. May we be the unity itself, unity abiding. So help us God.

   THE FEAST OF MARTYRS

   In occasione gladii mortal stmt {Hehr. II37). read of the blessed
   martyrs, whom we commemorate to-day, that they were slain with the
   sword. Quoth our Lord to his disciples, Blessed are ye when ye suffer
   for my name's sake.' And according to the scriptures these martyrs
   suffered death for Christ's name, being put to the sword.

   Here we learn three things. First, that they are dead. Man's sufferings
   in this world have an end. St Augustine says pain and the work of pain
   is finite and the reward is infinite. Secondly, that, seeing this life
   is mortal, we have no need to fear all the pain and travail falling to
   our lot, for it will end. Thirdly, that it behoves us to emulate the
   dead in dispassion towards good and ill and pain of every kind. The
   i)hilosophcr says heaven is immoveable. Referring to the soul as being
   the heavenly man who is imperturbable. One master enquires. If
   creatures are so vile, how comes it they so easily distract the soul
   from God ; is not the soul at her vilest better than heaven and all
   creatures ? The Doctor says it comes of minding too little about God.
   Were we to pay due heed to God it would be nigh impossible to lapse.
   From which we draw the moral that we ought in this world

   to emulate the dead. According to St Gregory, no one gets so much of
   God as the man who is throughly dead.

   The fourth point is the weightiest. He speaks of their being dead.
   Death gives them being. A philosopher says, Nature never breaks but to
   mend.' Air to fire, for instance, is a change for the better ; but air
   to water were destruction and untowardness. If this is nature's way
   much more is it God's : he never destroys without providing something
   better. The martyrs died : they lost their life and found their being.
   The philosopher says, Most precious is being and life, and knowledge is
   higher than life and nobler than being, for in knowing we have life and
   being.' Yet life is nobler than being in the sense that a tree has life
   whereas a stone has being. Again, take being pure and simple, as it is
   in itself, and being transcends both knowledge and life, for in that it
   is being it is both knowledge and life. They have, I say, lost their
   natural life and have acquired being. The philosopher says there is
   nothing so like God as being : in so far as it is real being it is the
   same thing as God. The philosopher says, Being is pure, exalted : all
   that God is is being. God knows nothing but being, he is conscious of
   nothing but being ; being is his ring. God loves naught save his being,
   he thinks of naught save his being. I say, all creatures are being. One
   master says some creatures are so nigh to God and so instinct with
   divine light that they give being to other creatures. Tliat is not the
   case : being is too pure, too high, too much the same as God, for
   anyone but God to be able to give being. God's idiosyncrasy is being.
   The philo- sopher says one creature is able to give another life. For
   in being, mere being, lies all that is at all. Being is the first name.
   Defect means lack of being. Our whole life ought to be being. So far as
   our life is being, so far it is in God. So far as our life is akin
   thereto, so far it is kin to God. There is no life so feeble but taking
   it as being it excels anything life can ever boast. I have no doubt of
   this, that if the soul had the remotest notion of what being means she
   would never waver from it for an instant. The most trivial thing
   perceived in God, a flower for example as espied in God, would be a
   thing more perfect than the universe. The vilest thing present in God
   as being is better than angelic knowledge.

   When angels turn to creaturely knowledge, then it grows dark. St
   Augustine says. When angels know ereatures in God, twilight falls ;
   when the soul knows God in creatures it is eventide. But knowledge of
   creatures in God is the dawn. And when she knows God in himself as pure
   essence, that is high noon. It should be the soul's desire to see, as
   though in non-sense, this most noble being. We advocate dying in God,
   to the end that he may raise

   us up to being which is better than life : the being our life subsists
   in, wherein our life is quickened into actuality. We ought to face ^
   death willingly and die in order to obtain a better resurrection.

   I said on one occasion that a bit of wood is more precious than gold, a
   surprising statement. But a stone is nobler (having being) than God and
   his Godhead without being, if such a thing is possible as to abstract
   his being. That must be a vigorous life in which dead things revive, in
   which even death is changed to life. To God naught dies : all things
   are living in him. They being dead (as the scriptures say about the
   martyrs) are quickened into life eternal, into the life where living is
   real being. We must be so tliroughly dead as to be moved by neither
   good nor ill. What we know we must knoAv in its cause. We never really
   know anything in itself till we know it in its cause. There is no
   understanding it until wc^ apj^rehend it in its origin. Just as life is
   never perfected till it returns to its original source, wherein life is
   real being. The thing that k(ieps us from remaining there is, as the
   philosopher explains, our being in contact with time. What time can
   touch is temporal and mortal. The philosopher states that the heavenly
   progression is eternal ; true, it gives rise to time, and that makes it
   mortal. In its course it is eternal, all unwitting of time ; in other
   words, the soul obeys the laws of abstract being. Another thing is its
   being full of opposites. What are opposites ? Good and bad, white and
   black are in opposition, a thing which has no j)lace in real being.

   The philosopher says the soul is given to the body for her perfecting.
   Soul apart from body possesses neither intellect nor will : she is one
   with no attendant power of speech ; true, she has it in her ground, in
   its root as it were, but not in fact. The soul \ is purified in body by
   collecting things scattered and dispersed. The resultant of the five
   senses, when these are recollected, gives her a common sense wherein
   everything sums up to one. In the second place, she is purified by a
   saving habit, that namely of ascending into the unitive life. The
   soul's perfection consists in liberation from the life which is in part
   and admission to the life which is whole. All that is scattered in
   nether things is gathered together when the soul climbs up into the
   life where there are no opposites. The soul knows no opposition when
   she enters the light of intellect. Anything short of this light falls
   into death and dies. Perfection of soul consists, thirdly, in absence
   of sensible affection. What is prone to aught other shall die, it
   cannot last. We beseech thee Lord God to help us escape from the life
   that is divided into the life that is united. So help us God. Amen.

   LXXXIII

   ST GERMANUS' DAY

   In diebus suis placuit deo et inventus est Justus {Eccl. In

   these words which I quote in Latin we celebrate the saint, Ger- manus
   by name, whose virtuous life so much is written of and whose festival
   is kept to-day in holy Christendom.

   In his days,' that means there is more than one day. There is the
   soul's day and God's day. Days here, all that have passed for seven
   thousand years, are as near God's day, to-day, as is yesterday. Why ?
   Because time yonder is in the present now. The heavens revolve, hence
   time ; day started when the heavens began to spin. Yonder the soul's
   day is passing in the present, in her natural light where all things
   are, where there is perfect day, God's day, day and night in one.
   Yonder in the day of eternity the soul is in the essential now ; there
   the Father is be- getting his (one-begotten Son) in the here and now,
   there the soul is being reborn in God. As often as this birth takes
   place she is giving birth to the only Son. Full many arc the sons of
   virgins born who travail in eternity, superior to time. But however
   many sons the soul gives birth to in eternity she has no more than the
   one Son, for it is supcrtemporal ; it comes to pass in the eternal day.

   Just indeed is he who lives in virtue and in virtuous deeds ; who
   seeketh not his own in any thing, iicithcr in God nor creature. That
   man dwells in God and (iod in him. He takes delight in flouting and
   getting rid of things, in being done with things as far as that is
   possible. St John says, God is love and love is God and he who dwells
   in love dwells in God.' Doubtless he is well lodged as heir to God, and
   he in whom God dwells has a good lodger. One of the masters says, God
   gives the soul a gift which moves her lo interior things. And it has
   been explained that the soul is moved directly by the Holy Ghost, for
   in the love wherein God loves himself, in that same love he is loving
   me, and the soul loves God in the same love wherein he loves himself;
   and were there not this love wherein God loves himself there would be
   no Holy Ghost at all. It is the heat, the blowing of his holy Breath
   that the soul loves God in.

   In one of the Evangelists we read, This is my beloved Son in whom I am
   well pleased.' In another we read, This is my beloved Son in whom all
   things please me.' And in a third we find, This is my beloved Son in
   whom I am well-pleasing to myself.' Whatever pleases God is pleasing to
   him in his only Son : whatever God loves he is loving in his only Son.
   So it

   behoves a man to live so that he is one with his only Son, so that he
   is his only Son. Between the only Son and the soul there is no
   difference. Between the servant and his lord there is no like love. As
   long as I am servant I remain unlike, remote from his only Son. If T
   could see God with my eyes the same as I see colours, that would not be
   right, for that which is visible is temporal. The temporal taken
   according to time is taken at its lowest value. Noxv is time and place
   in itself. While man has time and place, number and quantity, he is not
   as he should be, is not just, and God is remote and not his own. Our
   Lord says, Whosoever would be my disciple let him forsake himself,' as
   though to say, no one can hearken to my teaching till he is rid of his
   own self. All creatures in themselves are naught, ami that is why I
   counsel you to abandon naught and enjoy the perfect state where the
   will is just. His own will once relinquished man relishes my doctrine
   and can listen to my word. One master says, All creatures have their
   being straight from God, therefore by nature God must love them better
   than they do themselves. Did the soul know its own detachment it would
   not stoop to any thing.

   We say about this bishop, He was well-])leasing to him in his days.'
   The soul's day and God's day arc different. In her natural day the soul
   knows all things above time and place ; nothing is far or near. And
   that is why 1 say, this day all things are of equal rank. To talk about
   the world as being made by God to-morrow, yesterday, would be talking
   nonsense. God makes the world and all things in this present now. Time
   gone a thousand years ago is now as present and as near to God as this
   very instant. The soul who is in the here and now, in her the Father
   bears his one-begotten Son and in that same birth the soul is born back
   into God. It is one birth ; as fast as she is reborn into God the
   Father is begetting his only Son in her.

   I have spoken about one power in the soul ; in her first issue she lays
   hold of God not as being good nor yet as truth : delving deeper still
   she grasps him in his loneliness, in his solitude ; she finds him in
   his desert, in his actual ground. But being still unsatisfied, on she
   goes in quest of what it is that is in his Godhead, of the special
   property of his peculiar nature. They say no property (or, union) is
   closer than that of the three Persons being one God. And next they put
   the union of the soul with God. When the soul, being kissed by God, is
   in absolute perfection and in bliss, then at last she knows the embrace
   of unity, then at the touch of God she is made uncreaturely, then, with
   God's motion, the soul is as noble as God is himself. God moves the
   soul afte his own fashion. God contemplating creature gives it life ;
   crea- ture finds life in contemplating God. The soul has intelligent,

   LIKE THE MORNING STAR

   Quasi Stella matutina in medio nehulce etc, {EccL 50^), Like

   the morning star in the midst of a cloud and as the moon at the full
   and as the sun in his glory, so did he shine in the temple of God.'
   These words are commonly applied to aJl the saints and teachers who in
   their virtuous lives and knowledge of God have been a shining light to
   worldly hearts which, caught with creatures in the fog and cloud of
   darkness or ignorance, are straying like blind men from the way of
   eternal liberation, but more especially do they apply to the holy
   father we celebrate to-day, St Dominic by name, a mainstay of
   Christendom and founder of the Preaching Order which he started and
   established to propagate God's word and to help poor sinners.

   He shone like the morning star in the temple of God. What is God and
   what is the temple of God ? Four and twenty doctors met together to
   settle what God is, and they could not do it. Thereafter at a time
   appointed again they came together bringing each his verdict. Of these
   I will pick out two or three. One says : God is something to which all
   changing, temporal things are nothing ; all that has being is from him
   and is insignificant compared with him. Another says : God is somewhat
   that transcends being, that in itself needs none and that all things
   need. A third says : God is the intelligence wliich occupies itself
   solely in understanding itself.

   Passing over the first and the third I will speak of the second ; God
   transcends being. Nothing that has being, time or place is proper to
   God, he is above them ; his being in all creatures shows him superior
   to them, for that which is the same in many things . must be prior to
   them. According to some doctors, the soul is in the heart alone. Not so
   ; it is an error some eminent Scholas- tics make. The soul is whole and
   undivided at once in foot and eye and in each member of the body.
   Again, I take a span of ^ Sermon on St Dominic's Day. See also Jostes,
   No^ 31.

   time, which need not be to-day ov yesterday. But if I take the now that
   includes all time. The now wherein God made the world is as near this
   time as the now I am speaking in this moment, and the last day is as
   near this now as was yesterday.

   One of the doctors says : God is impartible, eternally energising in
   himself, immanent, uriindigent of instrument or aid, in need of none
   but what all things need and to which all things tend as to their final
   goal.' To this goal there is no way, it is beyond all ways, debouching
   in the open. St Bernard says, Divine love is a wont without a way.'
   I'he physi(ian wlio sets out to make a sick man whole has no particular
   mode of lu'altJi in view ; he has a mode whereby he hoj)cs to make him
   well, but how well he hopes to make him is not sjiccilied : he will
   make him as well as he can. How shall wc love God then ? As well as we
   can ; without measure. Each thing works after its own fashion ; things
   do not work in natures superior to their own ; fire, for examjde, only
   works in wood. God works above all natures, in the uncondi- tioned ;
   wherever he can stir he is at work in modeless mode. Before ever there
   was being God was working : he wrought in non-existent being. Advamted
   theology lays down that God is abstract being : he is as mucli above
   being as an angel is above a fly. I hold it is as wrong for me to say
   that God is being as to say the sun is black or white. God is neither
   this nor that. As St Dionysius says, * He who thinks that he sees (iod,
   if he sees aught sees naught of God.' But when I say God is not being,
   is superior to being, I do not witli that deny him being : I dignify
   and exalt it in him. If I find some copper in the gold, as existing
   there it is in a nobler being than itself. St Augustine says : God is
   mode-free mode, power-free power, good-free good.

   In the elements of the Scholastic teaching, wc find being divided into
   ten modes (or categories), all ol' which arc denied to God. God is
   subject to none of these mod(s nor is he deficient in any. The first,
   which has most being of them all, wherein all things have being, is
   substance ; and the last, which has least being, is called relatio, and
   in God it is the same as the first one is, which has most being. In God
   all things have the same form (idea), though this is the form of very
   different things. The most exalted angel, the soul, the fly, have all
   the same prototype in God. God is not being nor yet goodness. Goodness
   cleaves to being and does not go beyond it : if there were no being
   there would be no goodness. Being is purer than good. In God is no good
   nor better nor best. To say that God is good is to do him wrong ; as
   well say that the sun is black. But our Lord himself declares, None is
   good but God alone.' What is good ? That which communicates itself. Him
   we call a good man who

   gives himself and is of use to people. And hence the dictum of a
   heathen doctor, * A hermit is neither good nor bad, in the sense of
   giving himself and helping other people.' God par excellence
   communicates himself. No thing gives of its own being, for creatures
   arc not of themselves. What they give they have gotten from another.
   Nor do they give themselves. The sun gives light, no more ; the fire
   gives heat, the fire itself remains ; but God does give his own, for it
   is from himself he is and in all the gifts he gives he first and
   foremost gives himself. In all his gifts he gives himself: God, as he
   is, so far as the recipient will allow. St James says, Ev^ery good gift
   comes down from above from the Father ol lights.'

   When we take God in his being we take him in the forecourt of his
   habitation, for quiddity or mode is the way into his temple. Then where
   is God in his temple ? Intellect is the temple of God wherein he is
   shining in his glory. Nowhere does God dwell more really than in the
   temple of his intellectual nature, where he is in his stillness by
   himself, all undisturbed. As one of the doctors says, God in his
   self-perception is perceiving himself in himself.

   Now turning to the soul, she has a drop of intellectual nature, a
   spark, a ray, and she has sundry powers which function in the body. One
   is the power of digestion, more active by night than in the day,
   whereby man grows and thrives. And the soul has a power in the eyes
   which makes the eye so sensitive and delicate and too fastidious to
   accept things in the coarse-grained mode they have themselves, but they
   must first be filtered and refined by light and air, owing to the
   presence in it of the soul. Another power in the soul is that wherewith
   she thinks. This power is able to picture in itself things which are
   not there, so that I can see the things as well as I see them with my
   eyes, or even better. I can see a rose in winter when there are no
   roses, there- fore with this power the soul produces things from the
   non-existent, like God who creates things out of nothing.

   A heathen philosopher observes that the soul who loves God takes him
   under the veil of goodness ; and so far 1 have quoted mainly from the
   heathen doctors who know in the light of nature merely. I have yet to
   come to the sayings of the saints who see in a light far more exalted.
   He says then, that the soul in loving God is taking him under the veil
   of goodness. Intellect draws this veil from God and takes him bare,
   stripped of goodness, of being and of every name.

   At the School [the College of St Jacob] I used to teach that intellect
   is higher than the will, both as belonging to this light. Another
   theologian at the other School put will before the intellect on the
   ground that will enjoys things as they are in themselves,

   whereas intellect enjoys them as they are in it. That is quite true.
   The eye in itself is a better thing than the eye as painted on the
   wall. Nevertheless, 1 still maintain that intellect is higher than the
   will. Will takes God under the garment of good. Intel- lect seizes him
   naked, divested of good and of being. Goodness is a garnxent under
   which God is concealed and will takes God in this garment of goodness.
   If God had no goodness my will would repudiate God. It would be
   unseemly to robe a king in drab on his coronation day. I am not hap])y
   by reason of God's goodness. Never should I think of asking God to
   beatify me with his goodness, for he could not do it. Goodness is his
   vesture. My beatitude lies wholly and solely in the fact that God is
   knowable and in my knowing him. A philosopher says, The intellecit of
   God is what angelic being is suspended from.

   It is a question where the image really has its being : in the mirror
   or the object it proceeds from ? My image is in me, of me, mine. While
   the mirror faces me, it is my image in it; if the mirror falls it is my
   image which has been destroyed. Angelic being likewise depends upon the
   presence of God's intellectual nature wherein he secs himself like a
   morning star enveloped in the mist. I always have before my mind this
   little word quasi, like : indeed, it is the burden of my entire
   teaching. What at school the children call a mock, a by-word.

   The truest thing that man can predicate of God is word-and- truth. God
   calls himself a word. And St John says, In the beginning was the Word,'
   meaning that man is a word with the eternal Word. Like Venus, Fria's
   star, which Friday is named after and which has many names. When it is
   earlier than the sun and is uj) before it then it is called the morning
   star ; when it rises later than the sun and the sun sets lirst then it
   is called the evening star. Now it is above and now IxJow the sun, hut
   of all the stars it best keeps its distance from the sun, never going
   far away, and the moral of this is that any man who would attain to God
   must stay by, in the presence of, God the whole time and refuse to let
   God be put out of his mind by fortune or misfortune or by any creature
   whatsoever.

   And he says, like the moon at the full in his days.' The moon is the
   ruler of moist nature. The moon is never nearer to the sun than at the
   full, and then it gets its light at first-hand from the sun, but owing
   to the fact that of all the stars it is the nearest to the earth, it
   suffers from two drawbacks : being pale and mottled and also being
   liable to lose its light. It is never so potent as when it is furthest
   from the earth, and in that position it tells most upon the sea ; when
   it is on the wane its effect gets less and less. And the higher the
   soul rises above earthly things the

   more powerful she grows. Merely creature-lore will place a man beyond
   the need of sermons. For every single creature is a book. But anyone
   who means to get to that whereof we speak, to where my arguments all
   tend, must be as the morning star : a man in the presence of God,
   always with him, equally near him and exalted above mundane things : a
   word by the Word.

   There is one word both thought and spoken : angels, the soul and all
   creatures. Another Word, thought but unspoken, I can conceive. And
   there is still another Word unthought of and unspoken which never
   proceeds forth but is eternally in him who speaks it : in the Fatlier,
   for it is he who speaks it, it is eternally proceeding and abiding.
   Intellect is intrinsically active and more and more outwardly effective
   in proportion as it is directed inwards. God's ha])piness consists in
   its operation. And here again the soul should be an ad -verb. As the
   intellect of the soul turns more inwards, the more closely, more
   minutely is it identified with what it knows. The more powerful it is
   the more clearly it reflects and is atoned with God. That is not the
   case with corporal things : the stronger they arc tlic more external is
   their action. God's happiness lies in the subjective working of the
   intellect wherein his Word abides. It is this eternal Word the soul
   should be a word with and, doing one work with God, she will find her
   happiness in self-perception : in the very thing that God is happy in.
   May we ever be a word with this Word, So help us the Father and this
   same Word and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

   his goodness with him. And among all his creatures he bears no more
   love to one than to another : as each is able to receive he pours his
   love therein. Were my soul as capacious, as roomy, as a Seraph's, who
   has nothing in him, God would pour out into me the same as he does into
   that angel. If you describe a circle, a ring of dots with one point in
   the middle, from this point all the dots will be equidistant ; for one
   dot to get nearer it will have to be displaced, for the middle point is
   constant at the centre. So with divine being : it is not questing round
   about but abiding altogether in itself. In order to receive from it a
   creature must infallibly be moved out of itself. And when wx talk of
   man we arc talking of all creatures ; Christ himself exhorted his dis-
   ciples, Go forth and preach the gospel to all creatures,' for crea-
   tures all culminate in man. Not but what, as being, God is pouring
   himself out into all creatures, to each as much as it can take. Which
   is a lessoix to us to love all creatures equally with what we have
   received from God (though some are nearer to us by kinship or by
   natural friendship), as wc are favoured equally with the boon of divine
   love. I sometimes seem to like one better than another, and yet I have
   the same goodwill towards that other person whom I have never seen,
   only, by asking more of me, this one enables me to give him myself
   more. God loves crea- tures all alike and fills them with his being.
   And we too should pour forth ourselves in love upon all creatures. Wc
   often find the heathen arriving at this amiable state in virtue of
   their natural understanding. As the heathen philosopher observes, man
   is by nature a kindly animal.

   The second love of God, the spiritual, he is llowing with into the soul
   and into the angels, and it is by this light which is super- natural
   that, as I was saying, creature is rapt away out of itself. Creatures
   are so enamoured of their own natural light, it needs a strong
   inducement to take them out of it into the light of grace. In his
   natural light man enjoys himself, but the light of grace, which is
   unspeakably more ]&gt;owerful, robs him of his self-enjoy- ment and
   draws him into itself. As the soul says in the Book of Love, Draw me
   after thee in thy sweet savour.'

   Now we cannot love God without first knowing him, but the essential
   point of God is in the centre, equally far from and near to all
   creatures, and the only way of getting closer to it is for my natural
   intellect to be displaced by a light more intense than itself.
   Supposing, for example, that my eye were a light and strong enough to
   bear the sunlight in its glory and unite therewith, its interior state
   would then be due not to itself alone but to the sunlight as well. So
   with the mind. The intellect is a light, and if I turn it right away
   from things and in the direction

   of God then, since God is perennially flowing with grace, my mind is
   illumined and united with love and therein knows and loves God as he is
   in himself. Here we have the explanation of how God is flowing out into
   rational creatures in his light of grace and how we with our intellect
   approaching this gracious light are rapt out of ourselves and ascend
   into the light of God himself.

   The third love of God : in this it is granted us to learn how God has
   been begetting his one-begotten Son and is giving birth to him, as the
   Doctor says, now and eternally, he, like any woman, being brought to
   bed in every virtuous soul who has embarked on the interior life. This
   birth is his understanding, perennially up-springing in his paternal
   heart, wherein he has gotten all his bliss. All he has to give he
   expends on understanding : it is his progeny, his only pride. His
   entire happiness is centred in his Son ; he loves nothing but his Son
   and all he finds in him ; his Son is the light that has been for ever
   burning in his paternal heart.

   To enter there we shall have to climb by way of natural light into the
   light of grace and therein wax into the light that is the Son himself.
   There in the Son we are loved by the Father with his love (his Holy
   Spirit) which has its eternal source in him and having blossomed forth
   to his eternal birth (namely the second Person) is wafted by the Son
   back to the Father as the love of both. The Doctor says, I sometimes
   think of what the angel said to Mary, Hail, full of grace ! ' what is
   the good to me of Mary's being full of grace if I am not full also ?
   What does it profit me the F ather's giving his Son birth unless I bear
   him too ? God begets his Son in the perfect soul and is brought to bed
   therein that she may bring him forth in all her works. Thus we, by the
   love of the Holy Ghost, being unified into his Son, shall know the
   Father with the Son and love ourselves in him and him in us with their
   mutual love.

   Whoever would achieve this triple love must needs have four things. The
   first is, real dispassion towards creatures. The second, the true life
   of Leah, that is to say, the active life which is set in motion in the
   ground of the soul by the action of the Holy Spirit. The third thing
   is, the true life of Rachel, the contempla- tive life. The fourth is,
   an aspiring soul. A master was once questioned by his pupil about the
   angelic order. He answered him and said, Go hence and withdraw into
   thyself until thou understandest : give thy whole self up to it, then
   look, refusing to see anything but what thou findcst there. It will
   seem to thee at first as though thou art the angels with them and as
   thou dost surrender to their collective being thou shalt think thyself
   the angels as a whole with the whole company of angels. The pupil

   went away and withdrew into himself until he found all this in truth in
   his own ground. Then returning to his master he gave him thanks and
   said : It was as you foretold. On giving my whole mind to the subject
   of the angels and aspiring to their estate, at first it seemed to me
   that I was all the angels with the angels. You see then, said his
   master, that as you draw a little nearer to the source, wonder after
   wonder is wrought upon the soul ; for while a man is still on the
   ascent and receiving through the medium of creatures, he has not come
   to rest. But once he has climbed up into God, there in the Son he will
   be receiving with the Son the whole of what God has to give. May wc,
   ascend- ing in this way from one love to another, be united into God
   and there in bliss abide eternally. So help us God. Amen.

   DETACHMENT HAS FOUR STEPS

   Detachment has four steps. The first breaks in and makes away with all
   a man's })crishable things. The second one deprives him of them
   altogether. The third not only takes them but makes them all forgotten
   as though they had not been, and all about them. The fourth degree is
   right in (k)d and is God himself. When wc get to this stage the King is

   THE POOR IN SPIRIT

   Beati pauper es spiritu quia ipsorum est regnuui coelorum (Matt, 53).
   Beatitude itself opened its mouth of wisdom and said, Blessed are the
   poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' Angels and saints
   and everything that was ever born, all must keep silence when the
   eternal wisdom of the Father speaks ; for the wisdom of the angels and
   all creatures is mere naught compared with the wisdom of God which is
   unfathomable. This wisdom has declared that the poor are blessed.

   There are two kinds of poverty. One is outward poverty, and this is
   good and much to be commended in him who makes a voluntary practice of
   it for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose wont it was on earth.
   About this poverty I shall say no more. But there is another poverty,
   an interior poverty, whereto refers this saying of our Lord, Blessed
   arc the poor in spirit or poor of spirit.' And I would urge you now to
   be this same if ye

   MEISTER ECKHART

   would understand my argument, for I do assure you by the eternal truth,
   excepting yc are like this truth we speak of it is not possible for you
   to follow me. Several people have asked me what poverty is ? This we
   will now try to answer.

   Bishop Albcrtus says, By a poor man is meant one who is not satisfied
   with anything God ever made,' and this is well said. But, taking
   poverty in a higher sense, we say better still, a poor man is one who
   wills nothing, knows nothing, has nothing. It is on these three heads
   that 1 propose to speak.

   Jn the first place, a poor man wills nothing. Some folks mistake the
   sense of this ; those, for example, who win personal repute by penanees
   and outward disei})lincs (arul arc highly esteemed, God 'a merey,
   though knowing so little of God's truth !), To all outward ap})earanee
   these are holy, but they arc fools within and ignorant of the divine
   reality. These peo])Ie define a poor man to be one who wills nothing.
   Explaining this to mean that he never follows his own will at all, but
   is bent on carrying out the will of God. In this thej^ are not bad ;
   their intention is good, and we commend them for it : (iod keep them in
   his mercy. But 1 trow that these are not poor men nor are they the
   least like them. They arc much admired by those' who know no better,
   but I say they are fools with no understanding of God's truth.
   Peradventure heaven is theirs by good intention, but of the poverty in
   question they have no idea.

   Supposing someone asked nu\ What then is a poor man who wills nothing ?
   I should answer this. As long as it can be said of a man that it is in
   his will, that it is his will, to do the will of God, that man has not
   the poverty that I am speaking of, because he has a will, to satisfy
   the will of God, which is not as it should be. If he is genuinely poor
   a man is as free from his created will as he was when he was not. I
   tell you by the eternal truth, as long as yc possess the will to do the
   will of God and have the least desire for eternity and God, ye are not
   really poor : the poor man wills nothing, knows nothing, wants nothing.

   While 1 yet stood in my first cause I had no God and I was my own ; I
   willed not, I wanted not, for I was conditionless being, the knower of
   myself in divine truth ; then I wanted myself and wanted nothing else ;
   what I willed I was and what I was I willed. I was free from God and
   all things. But when I escaped from my free will to take on my created
   nature, then I got me a God ; for before creatures were, God was not
   God : he was that he was. When creatures became and started
   ereaturehood, God was not God in himself but he was Gk)d in creatures.
   Now we contend that God as God is not the final goal of creature nor
   such great riches as the least creature has in God. If a flea had
   intellect and could

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS 219

   intellectually plumb the eternal abysm of God's bein^r out of which it
   came, then, so wc maintain, not God and all God is could fulfil and
   satisfy that flea. Wherefore we pray we may be quit of God and get the
   truth and enjoy eternity, for tJie highest angel and the soul are all
   the same yonder where I was and willed that I was and was that I
   willed. Thus sliall a man be poor of will, as little willing and
   desiring as he willed and wanted when he was not. And in this wise a
   man is poor who wills nothing.

   Secondly, a poor man is one who knows notliing. Wc have sometimes laid
   it doAvn that a man ought to live as though he lived not, Avhether for
   himself, or truth, or God. But now we change our ground and declare
   withal, that a person in this poverty has gotten all he was when he
   lived not in any wise, not to himself, nor truth, nor (iod : he is so
   quit, so free of any kind of knowledge that no idea of God is alive in
   him ; for while man stood in the eternal species (iod, there lived none
   other in him : what lived there was himself. And so wc say this man is
   as free from his own knowledge as he was when he was not ; he Jets God
   travail as he will while he himself stands idle as ^vhen he came from
   God.

   Now the question is. Wherein does ha])piness lie most of all ? Some
   masters say it lies in love. Others, it lies in knowledge and in love,
   and these come nearer to the im^rk. We, again, contend it neither lies
   in knowledge nor in love, hut there is in the soul one thing from which
   both knowledge and love flow and which itself does neither know nor
   love like the powers of the soul. Who knows this knows the scat of
   happiness. This has no before nor after nor is it expecting anything to
   come, for it can neither gain nor lose. It is wanting, in the sense
   that it knows nothing about working in itself; but, it just is itself,
   enjoying itself God- fashion. And in this sense I say man ought to be
   idle and free, all unwitting, unaware, of what God is doing in him,
   that is the way to be poor. According to the masters, God is being,
   intel- lectual being which knows all things. But 1 say, (iod is not
   being nor yet intellect nor knows not this nor that. God is exempt from
   all things and he is all things. Being ])oor in spirit means being poor
   of all particular knowledge, even as one who wots not anything, not God
   nor creature nor himself. Here there is no question of a man desiring
   to know or recognise the way of God. In this wise may a man be poor in
   knowledge of himself.

   Thirdly, the poor man has nothing. It has been often said that
   perfection means not having the mortal things of earth, and haply this
   is true in one particular case, namely, when it is volun- tary. But
   this is not the sense I mean it in. I have already

   said, the poor man is not he who wants to do the will of God but he who
   lives in such a way as to be free from his own will and from the will
   of God, even as he was when he was not. Of this poverty we say, it is
   the deepest poverty. Secondly, we say, that man is poor who has no
   knowledge of God's work in him. Being as free of knowing and perceiving
   as God is of all things is the barest poverty. But the third poverty,
   the straitest I am about to tell of, ix, having nothing.

   Here I would remind you how I have often said, and eminent authorities
   have said the same, that one must be devoid of things and of
   activities, both inwardly and outwardly, if one would be a fitting
   place for God to work in. Now we say something else. Granting a man is
   bare of everything, of creatures, of himself, of God, yet if it is
   still in him to provide God with the room to work in, then we do affirm
   : as long as this is in the man he is not poor with the strictest
   poverty. God does not purpose in his work that man should have in him
   the place God does his work in ; poverty of spirit means freedom from
   God and all his works, so that if God chooses to travail in the soul
   lie must be his own workshop, as he likes to be. Finding so poor a man,
   then God is his own patient and he is his own operating room, since God
   is in himself the operation. Here in this indigence man is obeying his
   eternal nature, that he has been and that he is now and that he shall
   be for ever.

   There is the question of those words of St Paul, All that I am I am by
   the grace of God.' Here the argument soars above grace, above
   understanding and above desire. The answer is that St Paul's words are
   true ; not that grace was in him ; the grace of God wrought in him
   perfecting him to unity and then the work of grace was done. Grace hav
   ing done its work there re- mained Paul as he was. As we should say, he
   was a man too poor to have or be a place for God to work in. To
   preserve place is to preserve distinction. Why I pray God to rid me of
   God is because conditionless being is above God and above distinction :
   it was therein I was myself, therein I willed myself and knew myself to
   make this* man and in this sense I am my own cause, both of my nature
   which is eternal and of my nature which is temporal. For this am I
   born, and as to my birth which is eternal I can never die. In my
   eternal mode of birth I have always been, am now, and shall eternally
   remain. That which I am in time shall die and come to naught, for it is
   of the day and passes with the day. In my birth all things were born,
   and I was the cause of mine own self and all things, and had I willed
   it I had never been, nor any thing, and if I had not been then God had
   not been either. To understand this is not necessary.

   One learned doctor says, his breaking- through is nobler than his
   emanation. When I flowed out of God then all things said. There is a
   God. Withal this eaufiot make me blest, for in it I acknowledge myself
   creature ; hut in my breaking-through, 1 hen as standing passive in the
   will of God, free of the will of God and all his works and eke of God
   himself, I transcend all creatures and am neither God nor creature : I
   am that I was and that I shall remain now and for ever. Then I receive
   an impulse which carries me above all angels. In this impulse I
   conceive such passing riches that I am not content with God as being
   God, as being all his godly works, for in this breaking- through I find
   that God and I are both the same. Then I am what I was, I neither wax
   nor wane, for I am the motionless cause that is moving all things. Now
   God can find no place in man, for man has gotten by his poverty that he
   has been eternally and ever shall abide. Here in the spirit God is one,
   that is tlic straitest poverty a man can know.

   Whoso is unable to follow this discourse, let him never mind. While he
   is not like this truth he shall not see my argument, for it is the

   THE VIRGIN BIRTH

   Ave, gratia plena ^ dorninus tecum / {Luc, log)- Hail, full of grace,
   the I.ord is with thee ! The Holy Ghost shall descend into thee from
   above, from the lofty light-throne of the eternal Father.' Here there
   are three things to be understood. First, the radiant nature of the
   angel ; secondly, that he knew himself unworthy to behold God's motlicr
   ; thirdly, that he was speaking not alone to her but to a goodly
   multitude, to every virtuous soul desiring God.

   I say : had Mary not borne God in ghostly fashion first, he never had
   been born of her in flesh. The woman said to Christ, Blessed is the
   womb which bare thee.' To which Christ replied, Blessed not alone the
   womb which bare me : blessed are they that hear the word of God and
   keep it.' It is more worth to God his being brought forth ghostly in
   the individual virgin or good soul than that he was born of Mary
   bodily.

   This involves the notion of our being the only Son whom the Father has
   eternally begotten. When the Father begat all creatures he was
   begetting me ; I flowed out with all creatures while remaining within
   in the Father. Like what I am now saying ;

   it springs up within me, then I pause in the idea, and thirdly I speak
   it out, and all of you receive it : but really it is in me all the
   while. So am I abiding in the Father. In the Father is the exemplar of
   all creatures. This exalted nature has its intellectual prototype in
   God. And not merely intellectual but intellect itself. The best God
   ever did for man w'^as to be man himself. I will tell you a story to
   illustrate my point. Once upon a time there was a rich man and his
   wife. The lady by mischance did lose an eye whereat she grieved
   excessively. Then came her lord to her and said, O wife, why so
   distressed ? ' Quoth she, My lord, 'tis not my eye I mourne ; I monrne
   for fear lest you should love me less.' -- Nay wife, I love thee,' he
   replied. After- wards, not over long, he put out one of his own eyes,
   and going to his wife he said, Lady, so you may know I love you I have
   made myself like you : now I too have only one eye.'

   According to the philosophers, creatures arc all striving to bring
   forth and emulate the Father. Another doctor says that every active
   cause works solely for the sake of its result, to find rest and peace
   in its end. This is mankind, who scarce could credit God's great love
   for him till God did put out one of his own eyes by taking human
   nature. This was made flesh.

   Said our Lady, How shall this be ? ' The angel replied, The Holy Ghost
   shall come down into ihcc from on high, from the lofty throne of the
   Father of eternal light.' In 'principio. Unto us a Child is born, unto
   us a Son is given.' Child in his frail humanity. Son in his eternal
   deity. One philosopher declares that creatures are all striving after
   their ])rimitivc pure nature, after their supreme perfection. Fire as
   lire docs not burn : it is too intangible, too pure to burn at all ; it
   is tlie firc-nature which will burn, infusing into the dry wood its
   nature and its light according to its own most high perfection. God has
   done the same. He has made the soul according to his own most perfect
   nature, pouring into her the whole of his own light in all its pristine
   purity, while he himself remains all undefiled.

   Now you must know that I lately said : When God created all creatures
   he had surely gotten first something uncreated setting forth the
   general idea of creatures : to wit, the spark, which is so nearly God
   that it is a single, impartible one, bearing the form of all creatures,
   formless and above form.

   Yesterday in the schools there was a theological discussion. I said I
   was astonished at no one being able to give the solution of my question
   : If I am the only Son whom the Father has eternally begotten, have I
   eternally been Son ? I say, yea and nay. Son, yes, inasmuch as the
   Father has eternally begotten me ; not Son in my unbegotten nature. In
   principio. We are given to

   understand that we arc the only Son whom the Father has been bringing
   forth for aye out of liis arcane understanding of the eternal mystery
   of the first beginning of his primitive light-nature which is the end
   of all perfection. There I have been at rest for aye, asleep in the
   dormant understanding of the eternal Father, immanent, unspoken. I
   trow, seen in that light, any bit of stick would be an angel and would
   be intelligent, and not alone intel- ligent : it would be pure
   intellect in that first pure nature which is the perfection of
   enlightenment. Out of his light-nature he has been eternally begetting
   me his one ])egotten Son in the express image of his eternal Fatherhood
   to the c-nd that I may be the Father and beget him of whom I am
   begotten. liike one who stands before some lofty peak hailing, Art
   there ? ' And echo answers back, Art there ? ' He (*ries, Come forth 1
   ' -- Come forth ! ' the voice replies. This is what God does : he
   begets his Son into the summit of the soul. By the fact of his bearing
   his Son into me I bear him back into the Father. It was nothing else,
   God's virgin birth, than his getting his Son back again.

   I used to wonder (it is many years ago) whether I should be asked why
   one blade of grass is so unlike another ; and as it happened I was
   asked why they are so different. 1 said, it is more marvellous they are
   so mucli alike. One philosopher says that the blades of grass arc all
   different owing to the superfluity of the goodness of God which he
   pours out abundantly into all crea- tures the more to show his majesty.
   1 said it is move wonderful how much the grass-blades are alike,
   ex[)laining that just as all the angels are the sanu^ in their original
   pure nature so all the grasses arc the same and all things arc
   identical.

   I was thinking as I came along that one might here in time succeed in
   mastering God. Supposing I were up on high and told him, Come up
   hither,' that would be diflieult. Rut if I said, Bide down below,' that
   would be very easy. That is what God does. If a man is lowly God is
   unable to withhold his goodness ; he is obliged to sink himself, to
   pour himself, into that lowly soul, on the lowest of the lowly
   bestowing himself most of all and bestowing himself wholly. What God
   bestows is his nature, and his nature is his goodness and his goodness
   is his love. All joy and sorrow come from love.

   I was thinking on the way as I was walking licre, T should not have
   come were I not prepared to get wet for friendship's sake. If you have
   all got wet let me get wet too. Good and ill both come from love. Man
   should not be afraid of God. Some fear is harmful. The right sort of
   fear is the fear of losing God. It behoves man to love God since God
   loves man consummately. The masters say that all things arc in travail,
   labouring to beget

   themselves in the image of the Father. They talk of earth as fleeing
   from the heavens ; of her fleeing down and reaching heaven downwards ;
   of her escaping upwards to encounter the lowest of the heavens. Earth
   has no escape from heaven : flee she up or flee she down heaven still
   invades her, energising her, fructi- fying her whether for her weal or
   for her woe. God treats man the same : weening to escape him we run
   into his arms, for all corners are exposed to him. God will give birth
   to his Son in thee whether thou like it or loathe it ; whether thou
   sleepest or wakest God goes on with his work. That we have no sense of
   it is because our tongue is furred with the slime of creatures and
   possesses not the salt of divine affection. If we had godly love we
   should savour God and all the works God ever wrought and receive all
   things from God and be doing the same work as he docs. In this sameness
   we are all his only Son.

   God created the soul according to his own most perfect nature that she
   might be the bride of his only- begotten Son. He know- ing this full
   well decided to go fortJi out of the private chamber of his eternal
   Fatherhood where he has slept for aye and be proclaimed abroad while
   inwardly abiding in the lirst beginning of his primitive light-nature.
   So lifting up the tent of his eternal glory the Son proceeded out of
   the Most High to go and fetch his lady whom his Father had eternally
   given him to wife and restore her to her former high estate. For this
   reason he went forth and comes leaping like a love-impassioned swain.
   He came forth only to return again into his chamber, into the silent
   darkness of his mysterious Fatherhood. He proceeded out of the supreme
   in order to go in again accompanied by his bride and show her the
   hidden mystery of his secret Godhead, where he is at peace with himself
   and with all creatures.

   /n yrincipio signifies, in the beginning of all things. It also means
   the end of all things, since the first beginning is because of the last
   end. I trow that God himself is not at rest as being the first
   beginning : he is at rest where he is the end and cessation of
   existence, not that existence is then brought to naught : it is brought
   to its ultimate perfection. What is the last end ? It is the mystery of
   the darkness of the eternal Godhead which is unknown and never has been
   known and never shall be known. Therein God abides to himvSelf unknown,
   and the light of the eternal Father has been shining there for aye, and
   the darkness docs not comprehend the light. May we find this truth, So
   help us the truth whereof we speak. Amen.

   LXXXIXi

   1. THE WORD OF GOD

   Christ said, Blessed is the man who hears God's Word and keeps it.' The
   Father himself hears nothing, sees nothing, says nothing, begets
   nothing excepting his own Word, and in this Word the Father sees and
   hears and brings forth himself, even this Word and all things, his
   godhood in principle and himself in nature ; this Word with the same
   nature in another Person. Observe his mode of speech. The Father,
   fructifying, brings forth his own nature all at once, as understanding,
   in his eternal Word ; not at will nor as an act of will. That which is
   done or spoken by the power of his will he can in that same power
   refrain from if he will. Not so with the Father and his eternal Word ;
   whether he would or no he is obliged to speak his Word, to procreate
   unceas- ingly : this is rooted, so to say, in the Father-nature as
   deeply as the Father is himself. The Father speaks his Word then,
   willingly but not from will, naturally, not from nature. In this Word
   the Father speaks my and thy and every individual human soul as this
   same Word. In this utterance thou and I are the natural Son of God like
   the Word itself. As I have already said, the Father knows nothing but
   this Word and himself and all divine nature and all things in this
   Word, and everything he knows therein is like the Word and is the Word
   itself in nature and in truth.

   When the Father gives thee, reveals to thee, this gnosis, he is giving
   thee his life, his being and his deity, really and truly, all together.
   The human father shares his nature with his son but not his life or
   being. You can prove this by the fact that if the father dies the son
   may go on living or the son may die and the father go on living. With a
   common life and being they would live or die together. They are
   separate individuals as regards their life and being, and in this they
   differ from the heavenly Father and his Son. If I take a light from one
   place and put it in another these lights, as lights, are separate
   things, for one may go on burning while the other has gone out, and
   vice versa. Thus they are neither one nor yet eternal.

   But, as I was saying, the heavenly Father gives thee his eternal Word,
   and in that Word he gives thee his own life, his being and his godhood,
   all at once ; for the Father and the Word are two Persons and one life,
   one being, undivided. When the Father finds thee mentally seeing into
   this same light, this light itself in its own proper nature, as he sees
   himself and all things in his paternal power in his Word this very Word
   in utterance and in

   truth, then he gives to thee the power of begetting, with himself,
   thyself and all things and his own power in the shape of this same
   Word. Then with the Father thou art ever giving birth to thyself and
   all things in the here and now. In this light, as I have said, the
   Fatlier sees no difference between thee and him ; no more inequality,
   whether more or less, than between himself and his own Word. For in
   this light the Father and the soul and all things and the Word itself
   are one.

   2. THE WORD OF THE SOUL i

   -- Which of the words my soul speaks is most like the eternal Word ?

   -- There are two words which most fully reveal the eternal Word as well
   as the love that flows therefrom, so St Augustine says. One word is the
   Word of (iod and the other is the word of herself which the soul
   speaks.

   -- How does she speak the Word of God ?

   -- See, God is in all things, therefore God is also in thy memory ; and
   when the soul in her understanding gives birth to the image of God, as
   it lies in her memory, then God is the word of thy soul, and when' this
   word proceeds into the will it becomes love therein. Thus God Father is
   in thy memory and God Word in thy intellect and (iod Spirit in thy
   love, though but one God.

   -- May we say then, generally, that God speaks his own Word in the soul
   ?

   -- Ves, for when God speaks his Word in himself the Word acquires true
   distinction of Person ; but when our heart speaks the Word of God from
   memory, the word spoken by God does not acquire true distinction of
   real Persons, it is only a likeness and reflection of the eternal Word.

   -- When the Word of God is born in him and his memory speaks this Word,
   how can it be said : God speaks his Word in the soul ?

   -- To say, God speaks his Word in the soul is true ; and to say the
   soul speaks this Word in her intellect is also true, for God and man
   speak the Word of God together in our life. As a woman cannot bear her
   child before she has conceived it, so memory must first be big with the
   child she bears.

   she brought forth a son and called him John. Then said the people, What
   manner of child shall this be, for the hand of the Lord is with him.'
   One scripture says, The greatest gift is that we are God's child ' :
   that he begets his Son in us. The soul who is God's child, in whom the
   Son of God is born, in her shall nothing else be brought to birth.
   God's ultimate purpose is birth. He is not content until he brings his
   Son to birth in us. Nor is the soul content until the Son of God is
   born in her. It is thence grace springs. Grace is infused therein,
   grace doing nothing : its work is its becoming. It flows out of the
   essence of God and into the essence of the soul, not into her powers.

   When the time was fully come grace was born. Time is ful- filled when
   time is done. He who in time has his heart established in eternity and
   in whom all temporal things are dead, in him is the fullness of time.
   Rejoice in God all the time,' says St Paul. He rejoices all the time
   who rejoices above time and apart from time. Three things prevent a man
   from knowing God at all. The first is time, the second body, and the
   third is multiplicity or number. As long as these three things are in
   me God is not in me nor is he working in me really. St Augustine says,
   Because the soul is greedy, because she wants to have and hold so much,
   therefore she reaches into time and, snatching at the things of time
   and number, loses what she already has.' While there is more and less
   in thee God cannot dwell nor work in thee. These things must go out for
   God to come in ; except thou have them in a higher, better way :
   multitude summed up to one in thee. Then the more of multiplicity the
   more there is of unity, for the one is changed into the other.

   I said on one occasion, unity unifies multiplicity but multi- plicity
   unites not unity. Once having gotten over things, every- thing in us
   raised up to a higher power, we sliall never be cast down. If I minded
   God and God alone, had nothing over me but God, then nothing would be
   hard and surely nothing troublesome. St Augustine says, Lord, when I
   turn to thee, all hardship, suffer- ing and toil are taken from me.*
   Once gotten beyond time and temporalities we are free and joyous all
   the time ; then is the fullness of time, then the Son of God is born in
   thee. I once said that in the fullness of time God sent his Son. If
   aught is born in thee except the Son thou hast gotten nothing of the
   Holy Ghost and neither is grace working in thee. The origin of the Holy
   Ghost is the Son. Were there no Son there would be no Holy Ghost. The
   Holy Ghost does not proceed, it cannot blossom forth, except where the
   Father is in travail with his Son. Then he gives him all he has,
   natural and essential. It is in this giving that the holy Breath wells
   out. And it is God's intention to give

   himself entirely to us. As fire, to consume the wood must pene- trate
   the wood, finding the wood unlike. That is a matter of time. First it
   makes it warm, then hot, then it smokes and crackles, on account of its
   unlikencss ; and the hotter the wood grows the quieter and stiller it
   becomes, and the liker to the fire the more peaceful it becomes till at
   last it turns to fire altogether. For fire to consume the wood there
   must be no unlikeness.

   In truth, which is God, if thou intendest aught but God or seekest
   aught but God alone, the work thou doest is not thine nor is it God's.
   Thy intention in thy work that also is thy work. That which energises
   in me is my father and I am subordinate to him. It is impossible in
   nature that one should have two fathers : in nature one father is the
   rule. When other things are all ful- filled and done with, then there
   is this birth. A thing that fills is everywhere in contact with its
   boundary, nowhere falling short ; it has length, breadth, height and
   depth. If it had height and no length, breadth or depth it would not
   fill. St Paul says, Pray that ye may be able to comprehend with all
   saints what is the height, breadth, length and depth.*

   These three things stand for three kinds of knowledge. The first is
   sensible. The eye sees from afar what is outside it. The second is
   rational and is a great deal higher. The third corre- sponds to an
   exalted power of the soul, a power so high and noble it is able to see
   God face to face in his own self. This power has naught in common with
   naught, it knows no yesterday or day before, no morrow or day after
   (for in eternity there is no yester- day or morrow) : therein it is the
   present now ; the happenings of a thousand years ago, a thousand years
   to come, are there in the present and the antipodes the same as here.
   This power descries God in his vestibule. In him, over him, through
   him,' says the scripture. In means, in the Father ; over him is in the
   Son ; through him, in the Holy Ghost. There is no truth but contains
   the whole of truth, as St Augustine says. This power knows all things
   in the truth. From this power nothing is veiled. According to the
   scriptures, men's heads should be bare, the women's covered. The women
   are the lower powers, which are veiled. The man is the power which is
   bare and face to face.

   What wonders shall come from this child ? ' Speaking lately to some
   people who are very likely here to-day, I said, nothing is so hidden
   but it shall be revealed. All that is naught shall be done away, hidden
   and not thought of any more. We shall know nothing of naught, shall
   have nothing in common with naught. All creatures are a mere naught.
   That which is not here or there, which is an oblivion of all creatures,
   that is fullness of being. I told them how nothing that is in us shall
   be hid, that we shall

   disclose and give up to God everything we find within ourselves,
   willing or unwilling, good or bad, whatever we are prone to we shall
   die to in the truth. If we discover everything to God he shall discover
   to us in return everything he has : he shall hide from us in truth
   absolutely nothing of all that he has gotten, not wisdom, truth nor
   holiness nor deity nor nothing whatsoever. As God lives this is in
   truth the ease. If we disclose nothing to him, no wonder if he reveals
   nothing to us : we must both do the same, as we to him so he to us.

   It is lamentable how some people think themselves so far advanced, so
   one with God, although they have not yet abandoned self at all but hug
   themselves, like trivial things, in fortune and misfortune. They are
   precious far from what they think. They are full of notions and
   intentions. I sometimes say, if a man who seeks nothing finds nothing,
   what right htus he to con\plain ? After all, he has found what he
   sought. To seek or purpose aught is to seek or purpose naught and to
   pray for aught is to get nothing. But a man with no ulterior motive,
   who sets his mind on God and God alone, to that man God unbosoms
   himself wholly and gives him all the things concealed within his heart
   and for his very own as they arc God's own, no more nor less, provided
   he is after God and not things in between. What wonder if a sick man
   does not relish meat and wine ? He cannot taste the meat and wine ; his
   tongue wherewith he tastes is covered with a coating which is nasty and
   bitter by reason of the sickness of the man : he does not taste the
   proper flavour, everything tastes bitter. He is right ; things are
   rendered bitter by means and hindrances. When the hindrance is removed
   he tastes things properly. As long as there is anything between, God
   will never taste like himself to us and life will seem very hard and
   bitter.

   I once said that virgins follow the lamb wherever it goes, close
   behind. Some are virgins, some arc not, whatever they appear. Wherever
   this lamb goes the virgins follow, some only while it leads them in the
   pleasant places that they like. When it takes them into suffering,
   travail and discomfort they turn back and refuse to follow, and these
   are not virgins for all they seem to be. Some say. Lord, I want to go
   in honour, riches, comfort. Well, if the lamb has led you by that way I
   wish you well in following his footsteps. True virgins will follow the
   lamb through the highways and byways, whithersoever it may lead, and
   have no pity on themselves, befall what may. In the fullness of time
   there was born John,* that is, grace, as I have explained. May all
   things be fulfilled in us and grace be born in us, So help us God.
   Amen.

   REJOICE O HEAVENS

   Laudate coeli et exultet terra {Is. Ego sum lux mundi

   {Joh. 8^2)- I quote two Latin texts : one from the lesson, the words of
   Isaiah the prophet, Rejoice, O heavens and earth, God hath comforted
   his people and will have mercy on his poor ones.' The other comes out
   of the gospel. Our Lord's saying, * I am the light of the world : he
   that followeth me walketh not in darkness ; he shall find and have the
   light of life.'

   First take the words of the prophet, Rejoice, O heavens and earth.'
   Verily, verily, by God, by God and as God liveth, at the least good
   deed, the least good will, the least good desire, all the saints in
   heaven as well as all the angels rejoice with such great joy as all the
   joys of this world cannot equal. With the saints, the higher the more
   joyful, and all their joy combined is but a speck to the delight that
   God takes in this act. God plays and laughs in this good work, whereas
   all other works, those which redound not to God's glory, are dust and
   ashes in God's sight. Therefore he cries, Ye heavens, rejoice ! God has
   comforted his people.'

   Consider the words, God has comforted his ])eople and will have mercy
   on his poor.' His poor,' he says. The poor arc left to God alone, for
   no one troubles about them. Anyone who has a friend, a poor one, if he
   docs not forget him and if he has posses- sions and is wise, will say
   Thou art my servant,' and he is soon forgot; but to the beggar he will
   fliiig, God guard thee,' and be ashamed of him. The poor are left to
   God : wherever they go they may come upon God and have God in all
   places ; God takes them in charge, for they are abandoned to him.
   Wherefore he says in the gospel, Blessed are the poor.'

   Now take the words, I am the light of the world.' I am,' that touches
   the essence. According to philosophers, all creatures can say I,' for
   the word is common property ; but the word sum, am, none can really say
   but God alone. Smn signifies one thing which is big with good things as
   a whole, and it is denied to creatures that any one of them should have
   all human consolation. If I had my heart's desire but my finger hurt
   me, then I should have it not, for with a wounded finger, while it
   hurts me, I lack entire comfort. Bread comforts a man when he is
   hungry, whereas if he is thirsty bread wifi give him no more comfort
   than a stone ; and the same with clothes, when he is cold, but being
   hot no clothes will comfort him ; and this applies to creatures, hence
   all creatures have a certain bitterness of heart. True, creatures have
   this

   comfort for their souls, that none can deprive them of their rights.
   Their property is all in God whatever possessions they may have in
   creatures. As it is written in the Book of Wisdom, In thee all good
   belongs to my soul.' Creature comfort is imperfect, it has innate
   defect. But God's comfort is complete, with no shortcoming ; it is
   whole and perfect and he needs must give it thee, for he cannot work
   unless he gives thee himself first. God is foolishly in love with us,
   it seems he has forgotten heaven and earth and all his happiness and
   deity, his entire business seems with me alone, to give me everything
   to comfort me ; he gives it to me suddenly, he gives it to me wholly,
   he gives it to me perfect, he gives it all the time and he gives it to
   all creatures.

   He that folio weth me walketh not in darkness.' Philosophers attribute
   three powers to the soul. The first power ever seeks the sweetest. The
   second ever seeks the highest. The third one ever seeks the best, and
   the soul is too noble ever to rest anywhere but in her source whence
   drops what goodness is made out of. Behold, so sweet God's consolation,
   all creatures go in quest of him, hunting after him. Nay, I say more :
   it is creature's life and being, this searching after God, this hunting
   for him.

   Peradventure ye will say. Where is this God all ereatures are in quest
   of and whence they get their being and their life ? (Fain would I speak
   of the Godhead whence comes all our happiness.) The Father says, Son,
   this day do I beget thee in the reflection of the saints.' Where is
   this God ? Where the saints leave off there I begin. Where is this God
   ? In the Father. Where is this God ? In eternity. No man ever found
   God. As the wise man says, Lord, thou art a liidden God.' Where is this
   God ? Su))pose a man in liiding and he stirs, he shows his whereabouts
   thereby and God does the same. No one could ever have found God ; he
   gave himself away. One of the saints has said, I sometimes experience
   such sweetness in me that, forgetting creatures altogether, I dissolve
   right into thee. But when I try to embrace thee Lord, lo, thou art
   fled. What wouldst thou then ? Why draw me on only to run away ? If
   thou dost love me wherefore dost thou shun me ? Nay, Lord, it is to
   make me more eager to obtain.' The prophet says, my God.' -- Who told
   thee that I am thy God ? ' -- Lord, I cannot rest except in thee, I
   have no well-being but in thee.' May we thus seek God and also find
   him, So help us God. Amen.

   GOD-PARENTS AND GOD-CHILDREN

   Posui VOS ut eatis et fructum afferatis (Joh. Christ said to

   his disciples, I have set you to go and bring forth fruit.' God spake
   to them and to us all who are in darkness. Being in the dark we need a
   light to walk by. But Christ says : I am the light of the world.' If we
   keep in the true love of our head we shall be lighted by Christ. For a
   taper goes on burning at the tip in virtue of its contact with the
   flame which consumes the matter it supplies and changes it into itself.

   Observe. When Christ said to his disciples, I have set you to go,' he
   referred to our being taken up into the light of grace. The prophet
   says, I was sitting when he took me up into himself.' Sitting, we stop
   groping and, in the light, can see our way. To wit, the way of virtue.
   That is the meaning of Christ's words, I have set you to go.' Sitting
   is not going. We cannot go the right way without first sitting in the
   light of contemplation and making out the way to take ; all our works
   must be a light to lighten our neighbour's darkness.

   Now Dionysius says : These, who have thus gone out of

   themselves and are living in the light of truth, these (I say) are the
   christened, they arc god-children and godfathers.' Bishop Albertus
   expounds this as follows : God-children are they who, reading or
   hearing the holy scriptures read, take them to heart and show them
   forth in good works whereby they ultimately find the truth in God. The
   christened again arc dead in God, there is no longer anything alive in
   them but God. As St Paul says, We are dead and our life is hid with
   Christ in God.' But the most perfect of all are the godfathers, who are
   drowned in the unfathomableness of God ; not only does God live in them
   but they are alive in God and there is now in them the beginning of
   eternal life.

   Consider now those who arc god-children. Comprehending the scriptures
   in the light of faith they come into the dew of grace and in this
   gracious dew inhale the fragrance of the path of life eternal. As saith
   the Bride in the Book of Love, Take me along with thee, out in thy
   desert, within in thy fastness.' Out in the desert means detached from
   creatures ; the inner fastness is the subjective certainty of truth
   which tieither life nor death can alter. Such are these god-children,
   sons of power and wisdom and goodness. To them our Lord cries in the
   Book of Love, How beautiful arc thy feet with shoes, O prince's
   daughter ! ' The shoes being the holy life put on the feet of love and
   knowledge in the desire to walk

   therein. But the christened are in mystical union with God and are
   actually leading the life of God. What shall I say of these ? In their
   eating and drinking, their sleeping and their entire wont there is
   nothing found but God, did we but know it. Burn them, they yield but
   the test of divinity, the sweetness of the Holy Ghost, wherein they are
   gotten full of sap. But this none knoweth save the children of true
   light and him they dwell in, namely God. The children of darkness know
   it not, whose hearts are filled with the poison of everlasting death.
   Wherefore the light is turned to darkness in them and the eternal sweet
   to bitterness. God light us with the light we used to bask in in his
   Son eternally, so shall we escape from darkness into the true light !

   But the third class, yclept godfathers, these climbing hill and
   mountain have followed the track of the true sons with will and
   knowledge, and the flaming heat of the Holy Ghost having burnt up all
   their matter, they show now only the one light in God. In this light
   they have come to rest, at peace after their labours, the peace of
   absolute eonseiousness, a j)ea(?e which is never dis- turbed. Thought
   fails in speaking of these fathers, for they have received all good and
   perfect gifts from the Father of lights and have reached the goal of
   virtue. This goal set John, the soaring eagle, wondering in the
   Apocalypse. And Christ answered him, saying, I am the first without
   beginning and the last that has no end.' Amen.

   THE CROSSING

   Ejchibite membra vestra servire justituv iti sanctificationem (Rom,
   619). St Paul says, Yield your members servants to righteousness unto
   holiness, for the wages of sin is death but the reward of virtue is
   eternal life.' The soul has but two members to offer for service of the
   sort acceptable to God, these are will and understanding.

   One master says, God exerts the whole force of his will in loving the
   soul. But my point is that God's sole object in loving the soul is to
   make her love him in return. Again, I contend that God devotes his
   divine nature to pleasing the soul, to making her like him and enjoy
   his society and be friendly with him and love him. Thirdly, I hold that
   this love which comes up in the ground of the soul, sprouting out of
   the ground of the Godhead, that this (I say) is the self-same love
   wherewith God loves his one-begotten Son, and nothing less. And
   fourthly, if so be that man is planted in God as he is in creature,
   then I maintain it is in the very ground

   of the Holy Ghost's being and becoming, the very ground where the Holy
   Ghost is coming out in blossom.

   St Paul does well to say, Yield your members.' For intellect, albeit
   natural, is too exalted to be moved by mundane things. Yet, rendered to
   the source whence it proceeded forth it is absorbed in God, and that
   which absorbs it it becomes. Will, that is will proper, is as such
   omnipotent. But thousands die without acquiring this genuine will.
   Doubtless they had desires and inclinations like other animals. One man
   does something trifling, does it just once and sends it on the wings of
   praise and thank- fulness up to its source. Another one does some
   important work which occupies him long and constantly, and yet this
   little thing done once is more acceptable to God than the other man's
   great work which cost him so much time and trouble. Why ? I will tell
   you. Because the trivial act was carried up past time into the now of
   eternity, therefore it was to God's entire satisfaction. Though one
   should live through all the time from Adam and all the time to come
   before the judgment day doing good works, yet he who, energising in his
   highest, purest part, crosses from time into eternity, verily in the
   sight of God this man conceives and does far more than anyone who lives
   throughout all past and future time, because this now includes the
   whole of time.

   One master says that in this crossing over time into the now, each
   power of the soul will sur{&gt;ass itself. The five powers must pass
   into her collective power (or common sense), and common sense will
   vanish into the formless power wherein nothing forms. Intellect and
   will are transcended. True, grace is a creature, but by no means
   altogether. The soul has no inherent grace excepting in her ground, and
   above this ground of the soul grace is indigenous. Therein grace docs
   nothing, although it is effective in the uses of her powers ,* but in
   the ground of the soul grace, happiness and God's ground are one and
   the same life wherein God is living. There the power behind the eye is
   as noble as the understanding ; there foot and eye rank equal. What the
   soul is in her ground has never been determined. But Paul says, The
   grace of God is eternal life.' Paul also says, The wages of sin is
   death.' The deaths men die arc all of them as nothing to the death of
   the soul who is divorced from God, from which may God preserve us.
   Amen.

   initiate Christ and holiness and happiness and are ennobled.

   The prophet marvelled at two things. First, at God's doings with the
   sun and moon and stars. And secondly he marvelled at the soul, at the
   prodigious things God does and has done with her and for her sake, yet
   do what prodigies he may she still preserves the absolute dispassion
   which befits one of her noble lineage. Mark the nobility of her
   descent. I make a letter of the alphabet like the image of that letter
   in my mind, not like my mind itself. And so with God. God makes things
   in general like the universal image of them in himself, not like
   himself. Certain things he has speeially made like emanations of his
   own, such as goodness, wisdom and other so-called attributes of God.
   lint the soul he has made not merely like the image in himself nor like
   anything proceeding from himself that is predicated of him, but he made
   her like himself, nay, like he is, all told : like his nature, his
   essence, his emanating-immanent activity, his ground wherein he is
   subsisting in himself, wherein he is begetting his alone -begotten Son
   and where the Holy Ghost comes into flower : in the likeness of his
   in-dwelling out-going w^ork did God make the soul.

   It is a law of nature that fluids nm downhill into anything adapted to
   receive them ; the higher not receiving from the lower but the lower
   from the higher. Now God is higher than the soul, and hence there is a
   constant flow of God into the soul, which cannot miss her. The soul may
   well miss it, but as long as a man keeps right under God he immediately
   catches this divine influence straight out of God. Nor is he subject to
   aught else, not fear nor pain nor pleasure nor anything that is not
   God. Put thyself therefore right under God and thou shalt receive his
   inflowing divinity wholly and solely. The soul does not receive from
   God as from a stranger, as the air docs the light of the sun, which it
   takes as a foreign intrusion. The soul receives her God not as a
   stranger nor as inferior to God, for inferior is both different and
   distant.

   Philosophers say the soul receives as a light from the light, wherein
   is nothing foreign or remote. There is something in the soul wherein
   God simply is, and according to philosophers this is a nameless thing
   and has no proper name. It neither has nor is a definite entity, for it
   is not this or that nor here nor there ; what it is it is from another
   wherewith it is the same ; the one streams into it and it into the one.
   Hence the exhortation Enter into God in holiness,' for here is the
   source of the soul's whole life and being. This (light) is wholly in
   God and her other without him, so in this one the soul is ever in God,
   provided she smother it not and extinguish it in her.

   Philosophers say this (light) is present in God and never goes out in
   him and God is ever in it. I say, God has ever been in it

   and of it eternally. The union of man and God is not a matter of grace
   (for grace is creature and creature has nothing to do with it), except
   in the ground of divinity, where the three Persons are one in nature
   and it (grace) is that nature itself. Wherefore an thou wilt, God and
   the universe are thine. That is, if thou wilt put off self and things :
   doff the habit of thy personality and take thyself in thy divinity.

   The philosophers say that human nature has nothing to do with time ;
   that it is deeper-seated and more firmly rooted in a man than he is in
   himself. God took on human nature and united it with his own Person.
   Thus human nature was God who donned man's nature only, not any
   individual man. Would 'st thou be very Christ and God ? Put off, then,
   whatever the eternal Word did not put on. The eternal Word never put on
   a person. So do thou strip thyself of everything personal and selfish
   and keep just thy bare humanity ; thus thou shalt be to the eternal
   Word exactly what his human nature is to him. Thy human nature is no
   different from his : they are identical : what it is in him it is in
   thee. And hence 1 said at Paris that every prophecy of holy scripture
   is fulfilled in the just man ; for being perfect, the whole promise of
   the old and new testaments is accomplished in thee.

   How to be perfect ? There are two aspects of the question. The prophet
   says, In the fullness of time the Son was sent.' Now fullness of time
   is of two kinds. In the first place a thing is ful- filled when it is
   done, as day is done at eventide. So when time drops from thee thy time
   is fulfilled. Again, time is fulfilled when it is finished, that is, in
   eternity. Time ends when there is no before and after : when all that

   BUT NOW THE LIGHT IN GOD

   Eratis enim. aliquando tenebrWy nunc autem Ixlk in domino {Ephes* 5g).
   St Paul says, For ye were sometimes darkness but now the light in God.'
   The prophets walking in the light perceived and knew the truth umbraged
   in the procession of the Holy Ghost. Sometimes they were moved to
   return to the world and speak of things they knew to be conducive to
   our happiness, thinking

   to teach us to know God. Whereupon they would fall dumb, becoming
   tongue-tied and for three reasons.

   First, because the good they knew by sight in God was too immense and
   too mysterious to take definite shape in their under- standing. Such
   ideas as formed were so unlike what they had seen in God, were such a
   travesty of the reality, that they held their peace for fear of lying.
   Another reason was, that what they had gotten in God rivalled God's
   very self in its immensity and sublimity and yielded no idea nor any
   form for them to express. Thirdly, they were dumb because the hidden
   truth they saw in God, the mystery they found there, was ineffable. So
   it befell from time to time that, coming back and speaking of these
   things, they slipped, through lapses from the tnith, into gross matter
   and tried to teach us to know God by means of infernal creature things.

   Paul says, but now the light in God.' Aliquando, to those who are
   instructed, is the same as tvhen and expresses time, which is what
   keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God
   than time. He means not time alone but temporali- ties ; not only
   temporal things but temporal affections ; not only temporal affections
   but the very taint and aroma of time ; for as, where an apple has lain
   the smell lingers, so with the contact of time. According to our best
   authorities the visible heavens and the sun and stars have nothing to
   do with time beyond bare contact with it. This I cite as showing that
   the soul, which towers high above the heavens, has, at her very summit,
   no connection with time at all. Many times I have explained about the
   act in God, the birth wherein the Father bears his one-begotten Son
   whose proeession causes the interior blossoming of the Holy Ghost, that
   the Spirit proceeds from both and that in this pro- cession the soul
   comes leaping forth, the image of the Godhead being sealed into the
   soul in this procession ; and that in the return of the three Persons
   the soul goes back, re-informed into her primitive and formless form.
   Or as Paul puts it, now the light in God.' He does not say, Ye are the
   light ' but now the light.' Meaning, as I have often said, that to know
   things (really) we must know them in their cause. The philosophers tell
   us that things are suspended in their birth as in a look-out over their
   existence. The Father gives birth to his Son now. In this eternal birth
   wherein the Father generates his Son, the soul comes into her existence
   which is the image of the Godhead imprinted in her soul.

   It was mooted in the schools and maintained by some of the professors,
   that God imprints his image in the soul as a picture is painted upon
   canvas, and it fades. This was refuted. Others suggested with more
   truth, that God leaves in the soul a permanent

   impression of the nature of an abiding intention, as thus ; my wish of
   to-day is my purpose of to-morrow, the idea of which is kept alive by
   my actual thinking of it, just as, they said, God's works are done. For
   if the carpenter were perfect at his work he would not need materials :
   he would no sooner think a house than, lo, it would be made. And so
   with works in God : he thinks them and behold they are.

   Then came a third professor who spoke most truly of them all. He
   pointed out that yonder no work is done at all : it is the now, being
   without becoming, newness without renewing, and this existence is his
   essence. God's content is too subtile for renewal. And also in the soul
   there is a subtile nature too fine and rare to be renewed. In God it is
   all the here and now ; unrenewable.

   There are four points I had intended to discuss ; the subtile nature of
   God, the subtile nature of the soul, the work of God and the work of
   the soul. These I must leave over for the present.

   RIDDANCE

   Qui audit me non confundetur (Eccl, 2430). The eternal wisdom of the
   Father says, He that heareth me is not ashamed. (If he is ashamed he is
   ashamed of his shame.) He that worketh in me does not sin. He that
   reveals me and fears me shall have everlasting life.' I will consider
   first these words of the eternal wisdom, He that heareth me is not
   ashamed (or, confounded).' To hear the eternal wisdom of the Father he
   must be within, at home and by himself.

   Three things prevent our hearing the eternal Word. The first is body,
   the second number, and the third is time. If wc were rid of these three
   things we should be living in eternity and in the spirit, solitaries in
   the desert listening to the eternal Word. But our Lord says, No man
   heareth my word or my teaching till he be free from self.' ,To hear
   God's Word demands absolute self- surrender. Hearer and heard are one
   in the eternal Word. The subject the eternal Father teaches is his
   essence, his nature, his whole godhood, w^hich he divulges to us
   altogether in his Son, teaching us to be the Son himself.

   A man who has gone out of himself and is the only-begotten Son owns
   what is proper to the only Son. God's work and teach- ing are all done
   in his Son. God works with the sole object of getting us to be his only
   Son. As soon as he perceives that we are his only Son, God makes for us
   impetuously ; he comes well- nigh to shattering his essence, naughting
   his very self, in his

   rash haste to show us the whole abysm of his Godhead, the fullness of
   his essential nature. God flies to make this ours as it is his. Here
   God enjoys and delights in his plenitude. And this man who is within
   God's love and ken is none other than what God is him- self. Loving
   thyself thou lovest all men as thyself. While thou lovest anyone less
   than thine own self thou dost not love thyself in truth : not till thou
   lovest all men as thyself, all men in one man who is both God and man.
   The man who loves himself and all men as himself is righteous,
   absolutely just.

   Sometimes people say, I like my friends and benefactors better than
   other people.' But I say that is wrong, imperfect. True, we must make
   shift with it as we have to do with a side wind to cross the sea : it
   will take us over. Like our preference for one man above another, it is
   natural. To love another as myself means that I would as lief his fate
   for good and ill, for life and death, happened to me as him, which
   would amount to perfect understanding.

   As bearing on this subject St Paul says, I would I were divorced from
   God for ever, for God and for my friends' sake.' And as you know, to
   leave God for an instant is to leave God eternally and to leave God at
   all is hell torment. What does St Paul mean then by wishing to be
   divorced from God ? Doctors debate whether St Paul was upon the way to
   his perfection or whether he was perfect ? I say he was perfect,
   otherwise he could not have said this.

   I will put into plain words what St Paul means by wishing to depart
   from God. Man's last and highest leave-taking is leaving God for God.
   St Paul left God for Gixl : he left everything he could give or take of
   God, every concept of God. In leaving these he left God for God since
   God remained to him in his essential self ; not as a concept of
   himself, nor yet as an acquired thing, but God in his essential
   actuality. This is no case of give and take between himself and God :
   it is the one and perfect union. Here man is the true man whom
   suffering can no more befall than it can befall the divine essence,
   for, as I have said before, there is something in the soul so nearly
   kin to God that it is one and not united. It is one ; it has naught in
   common with naught and is naught to aught. Anything created is naught.
   It is remote and alien from creature. If man were wholly this he would
   be wholly uncreated and uncreaturely ; if everything temporal were so,
   were comprehended in this one, it would be nothing else than the unity
   itself. Were I to find myself but for a single instant in this case, I
   should esteem myself of no more moment than a worm.

   God gives to everything alike, and as flowing forth from God

   things are all equal ; angels, man and creatures all proceed from God
   alike in their first emanation. To take things in their primal
   emanation is to take them all alike. If here in time they are alike, in
   God in eternity they are much more so. Any flea as it is in God is
   nobler than the highest of the angels in himself. Things are all the
   same in God : they are God himself.

   God delights so in this likeness that he pours out his whole nature,
   his whole substance into it, in his own self. The joy and satisfaction
   of it are ineffable. It is like a horse turned loose in a lush meadow
   giving vent to his horse-nature by galloping full- tilt about the field
   : he enjoys it, and it is his nature. And just in the same way God's
   joy and satisfaction in his likes finds vent in his pouring out his
   entire nature and his being into this likeness, for he is this likeness
   himself.

   It is a question whether those angels who are dwelling here with us to
   serve and guard us have less likeness in their joys than the ones
   abiding in eternity : is it in any sense a drawback to them to be
   serving and protecting us ? No, not at all. Their joy is undiminished,
   so is too their likeness ; for the work of the angels is the will of
   God and the will of God is the work of the angels. Neither in their
   joy, their likeness nor their work arc these angels handicapped. If God
   should bid an angel go pick the cater- pillars off a tree, the angel
   would obey him readily, nay, since it is God's will it would be his
   happiness.

   Being established in God's will, a man will want what is God and what
   is God's will and nothing else. If he is sick he will not be wanting to
   be well. To him all pain is pleasure, multitude is pure and single,
   provided he is really in the will of God. Aye, though it were the pains
   of hell it would be joy and happiness to him. He has left himself and
   he is free, passive to all impressions. My eye can see colour because
   it is free to be coloured. When I see blue or white, my eye which is
   seeing the colour is taking the colour that it sees. The eye wherein I
   see God is the same eye wherein God sees me ; my eye and God's eye are
   one eye, one vision, one knowing, one love.

   Man being thus in the love of God is dead to self and all created
   things, and no more mindful of himself than one a thousand miles away.
   This man abides in likeness, in unity, and there is no unlikeness in
   him. This man has left the world and himself as well. Supposing some
   man owned the world and for God's sake gave it up just as he had gotten
   it ; then God would give him back the world and eternal life to boot.
   And if there were a second man possessing merely the good will, who
   thought ; Lord were this whole world mine, nay two of them (or any
   number he may choose), I would resign it and myself as well, entire as
   I received it from

   self, to him shall all be given. To leave himself for twenty years and
   then to have self back again, an instant, is never to have left himself
   at all. He who both has and is resigned, nor ever casts one glance at
   what he has resigned but remains firm and unshaken and motionless in
   himself, that man is free. May we remain steadfast and immoveable, like
   the eternal Father, So help us God and his eternal Wisdom. Amen.

   DIVES

   Homo quidam erat dives etc, (Ltic, IC^^). There was a certain

   rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously
   every day and he had no name.'

   This will equally apply to the causeless Deity and to the loving soul.
   There was a rich man.' Man means a rational entity. A heathen
   philosopher says, By man in the scriptures we mean God.' And St Gregory
   says, if there were in God one thing nobler than another we should say
   it is his understanding ; for in under- standing God is manifested to
   himself ; in understanding God is proceeding in himself ; in
   understanding God is proceeding forth into all things. Were there no
   understanding in God there would be no Trinity and no emanation of
   creatures.

   He had no name. And so is the threefold nature of God name- less ; such
   names as the soul gives him are gotten of her own understanding. As the
   heathen philosopher says in his book, The Light of Lights, God is
   superessential and super- rational and unintelligible,' that is, to the
   natural understanding. I speak not of gracious understanding, for by
   grace we may be brought to know as much as St Paul did, who was caught
   up into the third heaven where he saw those things that he neither
   would nor could express. He could not express them as he saw them, for
   when we know a thing we know it either in its cause or in its mode or
   by its activity. God remains unknown because he is the first {i,e, he
   has no cause), he is unconditioned (i,e, unknowable) and he is inactive
   (in his hidden stillness). He is without the names that are applied to
   him. Moses enquired his name. God answered and said, He who is hath
   sent thee.' He could not understand it in any other form. God as he is
   in himself he cannot give creatures to understand, not that he cannot
   do it but creature cannot understand. As

   the heathen philosopher says, God is beyond nature, beyond praise,
   beyond reason and beyond understanding.'

   This man was rich.' And so is God rich in himself and in all things.
   Mark the plenitude of God. It is fivefold. First, he is the prime
   cause, so he pervades all things. -- Next, he is essentially one, so he
   is universal. -- Thirdly, he is the fountain-head, so he is flowing
   into all things. -- Fourthly, he is unchangeable, so he is most
   desirable. -- Fifthly, he is perfect, so he is most incomprehensible.

   Being the first cause he imparts himself. As tlie heathen philosopher
   observes, The First Cause pours into causes in general more than these
   secondary causes pour into their causes.' Again, he is indivisible.
   Bishop Albcrtus says a thing is impartible which is intrinsically one
   without a second. And the sum of all partiblcs amounts to what he is.
   In him creatures are one in the same, they are God in God. In
   themselves they are naught. -- Thirdly, being the fountain-head he is
   overflowing into all things. Bishop Albertus says : Into things in
   general he flows in three ways : in being, in life and in light ; and
   into the rational soul in particular as the potentiality of all things,
   the bringing back of creatures to their original source.' To wit, the
   light of lights : All gifts and perfections flow from the Father of
   lights,' as St James says. -- Fourthly, being unchangeable he is most
   comfortable. Here note that God unites with things while keeping his
   intrinsic oneness, and all things are one in him. Hence Christ's words,
   Ye shall be turned into me and I into you.' Owing to his
   unchangeableness and the littleness of creatures. For as the prophet
   says, all things arc to God as a drop to the ocean. And as the drop
   becomes the ocean not the ocean the drop so the soul imbibing God turns
   into God, not God into the soul. There the sold loses her name, her
   power and lier activity but not her existence. The soul abides in God
   as God is abiding in himself. Anent which Bishop Albertus declares that
   the will a man dies in he abides in eternally. -- Fifthly, being
   perfect he is most incom- prehensible. God is self-perfect and
   omni-perfect. What is perfection in God ? It means that he is brim-full
   of himself and is the sole good of all things. And because he is good
   he is the desired of all things.

   HE WENT UP INTO A MOUNTAIN

   Videus Jesus turbas ascendit in montem etc, (Matt. 5^). We read in the
   gospel that our Lord departed from the multitude and ascended into the
   mountain. There he opened his mouth and taught them about the kingdom
   of God.

   St Augustine says, The student of this subject sets his stool in
   heaven.' The student of God must rise above things scattered : these he
   must eschew. To take in God's instruction he must gather himself
   together and withdraw into himself, turning his back on care and the
   pursuit of nether things and on his powers so many and so various. He
   must leave all these behind, even as existing in his thought, not but
   what thought works wonders in itself. These thoughts must be
   transcended if God is to speak into the powers which are inseparate.

   Again : He went up into the mountain ' implies that God is imparting
   the sublimity and sweetness of his nature. In this intuition wherein
   there must needs fall away everything that is creature, he is aware of
   nothing but God and himself as the image of God.

   Tliirdly : his asegnt into the mountain betokens his exaltation (what
   is high is near to God) and concerns the powers trenching on divinity.
   Upon one occasion our Lord took three of his dis- ciples and led them
   up into a mountain where he appeared before them in that same
   light-body wherein we shall see him in eternal life. Our Lord said to
   the children of Israel, Remember what I told you about heaven : ye see
   there neither image nor form nor any likeness.' When a man does leave
   the multitude God comes into his soul without image or likeness.

   St Augustine teaches about three kinds of knowledge. The first is
   bodily : the eye, for instance, is sensible of images. The second is
   mental but still admits of images of bodily things. The third is in the
   interior mind, which knows without image or likeness, and this
   knowledge is like unto the angels.

   The higher angels are divided into three. One philosopher says ; The
   soul knows only in effigy. Things are all known in image and likeness,
   but angels know themselves without likeness, and God.' What he means to
   say is : God imparts himself to the soul at her summit without image or
   likeness.

   He went up into the mountain and was transfigured before them. The soul
   must be transfigured or re-formed and sealed and re-cast in his form. I
   maintain that the soul transcends form, she being east in the form of
   God's Son. According to the masters, the Son is the image of God and
   the soul is formed in his image. I agree. But the Son is the image of
   God above form : the form of his concealed Godhead : the Son as the
   idea, as the conception of God, that is the form of the soul. By the
   fact that the Son loves the soul loves also. Where the Son is
   proceeding is not where the soul is suspended : she is above form.
   I'^ire and heat are one and yet far from the same. Taste and hue in an
   apple are one but by no means identical. The tongue can

   taste things which are lost on the eye ; the eye perceives colours the
   tongue knows not of. The soul knows one only ; she is above form.

   The prophet says : God will lead his sheep into green pastures. Sheep
   is in the singular ; and so are they singular who are simplified to
   one. A philosopher says, that nowhere is the heavenly course so plain
   as in the simple hearts who guilelessly accept the heavenly influence
   and in children with no mind of their own. The clever and active-minded
   people are carried away into multitudinous things. Our Lord promises to
   feed his sheep in the primitive mountain pastures, on green grass. In
   God all creatures are in embryo. First, all creatures sally forth from
   God and then the angels. To have the nature of one particular creature
   is to bear the stamp of creatures as a whole. An angel's nature bears
   the impress of all creatures.. All that angelic nature can receive is
   summed up in him. Whatever God chooses to create his angels entertain
   on penalty of missing the perfection which belongs to other creatures.

   St Augustine says : What God creates has a channel through the angels
   on high, where on the hill -tops everything is flourishing, where
   creatures are all fresh and green. Falling into time they droop and
   fade. Among the young green of all creatures there our Lord pastures
   his sheep. Creatures which flourish on these verdant heights are, as
   existing in the angels, more grateful to che soul than all the things
   of this world. The vilest of creatures as it is there, is to this world
   as day to night.

   Whoever would be taught by God has to ascend this mountain ; there God
   will perfect them in the day of eternity when the light is full. What I
   perceive in God is light ; what touches creatures is darkness. The true
   light has no contact with creatures. Spirit- ual perception is light.
   St John says, God is the true light that shineth in the darkness.' What
   is the darkness ? In the first place ; independence, detachment : being
   blind and unaware of creatures. As I have frequently said ; to see God
   we have to be blind. Again, God is the light which shines in the
   darkness. He is the blinding light. That is, light incomprehensible,
   illimit- able, that knows no end. Its blinding the soul means that she
   knows nothing, is aware of nothing. The third darkness is best^ of all
   : there is no light. A master says, Heaven has no light, it is too high
   up for that ; it does not shine and in itself is neither hot nor cold.'
   In this darkness the soul has lost all light, she has outgrown what we
   call light and colour.

   A philosopher says : Light is the Supreme, God's promised land.' A
   philosopher says ; The realization of every desire is brought to the
   soul in this light.' A philosopher says : There never was anything
   subtile enough to enter the ground of the soul

   but God only.' Meaning to say : God shines in that darkness where the
   soul transcends all light. For what though her powers are open to
   sweetness and light and grace yet into the ground of the soul she lets
   nothing but absolute God. Whatever besides of sweetness and light
   proceeds from him she receives merely into her powers.

   According to our best authorities the powers of the soul and she
   herself are one : fire and fire-light arc one, and where it (light)
   changes to reason it changes to anotlier nature. Where intellect issues
   from the soul it invents another nature. Thirdly, the light of lights
   where soul transcends all light is on the mountain sum- mit where no
   light exists. Where Gotl breaks out into his Son is not where the soul
   hangs from. Where God is proceeding, we knowing God somewhat, is not
   where the soul is suspended, it is infinitely higher up than that ; she
   transcends light and knowledge completely. He says, I will deliver them
   and will gather them together and bring them into their own land where
   I will lead them into green pastures (upon the mountain of Israel).'
   Upon this mountain he opened his mouth. One doctor says : Our Lord
   opens his mouth here below leading us by the scriptures and by means of
   creatures.' But St Paul says, Now hath God spoken to us in his
   only-begotten Son in whom 1 know from the least to the greatest all at
   once in God.' May we out-grow whatever is not God, So help us God.

   BE YE RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF YOUR MIND

   Renovamini spiriiu mentis vestree (Kphes- 423 ). Be ye renewed

   in the spirit,' here called mens or mind. Thus speaks St Paul. Now St
   Augustine says that in the highest part of the soul, there known as mem
   or the mind, there was created along with the soul a capacity called by
   philosophers the casket or shrine of niind-forrns or formless images.
   This power makes the Father com- parable with the soul in his emanating
   deity whereof he has poured forth the whole hoard of divine being into
   the Son and into the Holy Ghost in distinction of Persons, just as the
   memory of the soul pours out treasure of ideas into the soul -powers.
   Now if with this faculty the soul sees form, whether she sec the form
   of an angel or her own form, it is an imperfection in her. But when all
   forms are detached from the soul and she sees nothing but the one
   alone, then the naked essence of the soul finds the naked, formless
   essence of the divine unity, the superessential being, passive,
   reposing in itself. O surpassing wonder, what

   lofty suffering is that, when the soul suffers nothing but the absolute
   unity of Gk)d !

   Ye shall be renewed in the spirit, says St Paul. Renewal befalls all
   creatures under God ; but for God there is no renewal, only all
   eternity. What is eternity ? -- It is characteristic of eternity that
   in it youth and being are the same, for eternity would not be eternal
   could it newly become and were not always. Now I maintain that renewal
   befalls the angels, that is, in their knowledge of the future, for an
   angel knows of future things only so much as God reveals to him. And
   renewal befalls the soul in so far as she is soul, and she is soul in
   so far as she gives life to the body and is the form of the body. And
   renewal befalls her too inasmuch as she is spirit. She is spirit in so
   far as she is detached from here and now and from cv^cry thing that
   belongs to matter. But so far as she is the image of God and nameless
   as God is, no renewal befalls her but only eternity, as in God. Now
   mark ! God is nameless ; no one can know or say anything of him. A
   heathen philosopher says that what we know or predicate about the first
   cause is what we are ourselves rather than what the first cause is, for
   this transcends speech and knowledge. If I say God is good, it is not
   true : I am good, God is not good. I say more : I am better than God
   is, for what is good can be better and what is better can be best. But
   God is not good, therefore he cannot be better ; and since he cannot be
   better therefore he cannot be best. These three : good, better, best
   are remote from God who is above all. And if, again, I say that God is
   wise, it is not tme : I am wiser than he. Or if I say, God is a being,
   it is not true : he is a trans- cendental essence, a superessential
   nothing. St Augustine says, The finest thing a man can say of God is
   that he is silent from consciousness of interior fullness.' Wherefore
   hold thy peace and prate not about God, for prating of him thou dost
   lie, committing sin. If thou wouldst be free from sin and perfect,
   babble not of God. Neither know anything of God, for God is beyond
   knowing. One' philosopher says. Had I a God that I could know I would
   have him for my God no longer. Know'st thou of him anything ? He is no
   such thing, and in that thou dost know of him anything at all thou arc
   in ignorance, and ignor- ance leads to the condition of the brute ; for
   in creatures what is ignorant is brutish. If thou wouldst not be
   brutish then, know nothing of the unuttered God. -- What then shall I
   do ? ' -- Thou shalt lose thy thy-ness and dissolve in his his-ness ;
   thy thine shall be his mine, so utterly one mine that thou in him shalt
   know eternalwise his is-ncss, free from becoming : his nameless
   nothingness.

   to be renewed in spirit, then those six powers of the soul, the higher
   and the lower, must each wear a golden finger-ring all gilded over with
   the gold of divine love. Consider the lower powers, which are three.
   The first is called reason, rationale ; on this thou shalt wear a
   golden finger-ring : light, so that thy reason may be all the time
   timclessly irradiated with divine light. The second power is rage,
   irascihilis ; on it thou shalt wear the finger-ring, thy peace. And why
   ? Because, in peace, in God ; without peace, out of God. The third
   power is desire, concupis' cihilis ; and on it thou shalt wear, enough,
   so that thou mayst have done with all creatures under God ; but with
   God thou shalt never have done, for of God thou eanst never have enough
   : the more thou hast of God the more thou wantest of him couldst thou
   have enough of him, could enough ever be applied to God, God were not
   God.

   Also on each higher power thou shalt wear a golden finger- ring. Of
   these higher powers there are likewise three. The first is the
   retentive faculty, memoria. This power is likened to the Father in the
   Trinity. On it thou shalt wear the golden fmger- ring, remembrance,
   that all eternal things may be stored up in thee. The second one is
   understanding, intellectns. This power is likened to the Sou. On this,
   too, thou shalt wear a golden finger-ring, perception, that thou mayst
   be ever apprehending

   God. In what way ? ' -- Thou shalt know him witliout image,

   without semblance and without means. But for me to know God thus, with
   nothing between, I must be all but he, he all but me.' - I say, God
   must be very I, 1 very (iod, so consummately one that this he and this
   I arc one is, in this is -ness working one work eternally ; but so long
   as this he and this I, to wit, God and the soul, are not one single
   here, one single now, the I cannot work with nor be one with that he.
   The third power is will, voluntas. This power is likened to the Holy
   Ghost. On it thou shalt wear the golden finger-ring, love, that thou
   mayst love God. But thou shalt love God apart from loveworthiness : not
   because he is worthy of love, for God is unloveworthy : he is superior
   to love and loveworthincss. -- How then shall I love him ? ' -- Thou
   shalt love God non-spiritually, thy soul must be de-spiritualised :
   stripped of spirituality. For while thy soul is specifically spirit,
   she has form ; the while she has form she has neither unity nor union ;
   the while she lacks union she has never really loved God, for actual
   love lies in union. Wherefore let thy soul be de-spirited of all spirit
   ; let it be spiritless ; if thou lovest God as God, as spirit, as
   Person or as image, that must all go. -- Then how shall I love him ? '
   -- Love him as he is ; a not-God, a not-spirit, a not- Ferson, a
   not-image ; as sheer, pure, limpid unity, alien from all

   to nothingness. So help us God. Amen.

   C

   ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL

   Unus deus et pater omnium^ qui est super omnes et per omnia et in
   omnibus nobis {Ephes, 4g). I am quoting St Paul's words, One God and
   Father of all who is above all and through all and in us all.' From the
   gospel I will take another saying, the saying of our Lord, Friend, go
   up higher.'

   To begin with, when St Paul speaks of one God and Father of all ' the
   omission of the particle suggests some variation from his one God.' God
   is one in himself and apart from all. God belongs to none and none
   belongs to him, God is one. Boethius says, God is one and changes not.
   God's whole creation he created without changing. All things, once
   created, progress in changing. The moral of which is that we ought to
   be one in ourselves and wholly free from attachment. Firm and unshaken
   in God does it behove us to be. Out of God there is notliing but
   naught. No change nor movement can get into God. What seeks another
   place outside him, that changes. God has all things in him in one
   omnipotentiality ; God seeks not anything outside himself, for he has
   got it in him in its perfection. No creature can conceive it as it is
   in God.

   Another teacher says, Father of all, blessed art thou.' This too is big
   with change, for calling him Father he makes us his children. And if he
   is our Father then we as his children shall have his honour at heart.
   Our Lord says, Blessed arc the pure in heart for they shall see God.'
   Purity of heart means separation, cleansing, from all bodily things,
   the isolation of the self and in this abstraction the plunging into God
   and being atoned with him.

   David says, Those works are pure and guileless which arc pursued and
   perfected in the light of the soul ' ; and those are yet more guileless
   which abide therein in the depths of the spirit and proceed not forth.
   One God and Father of all.'

   The other saying, Friend, come up higher, take the higher seat.' I will
   make of twain one. Friend, come up higher, draw up,' is the friendly
   conversation of the soul with God. He says, Friend, draw up, come up
   higher,' and, answering her : one God and Father of all. A certain
   philosopher says. Friend- ship resides in the will. But so far as
   friendship resides in the will it does not unify. Love does not unify ;
   true, it unites in act but not in essence. It merely says, One God,
   come up higher.

   draw nigh.' Into the ground of the soul nothing enters but God himself.
   Even the highest angel, although he is so nigh to God and is endowed so
   largely with God's love (his works are estab- lished in God in one
   essence not one operation ; he has in God an immanence, a settled
   habitation), this angel, strange to say, exalted though he be, is not
   allowed into the soul. One master lays it down that all creatures
   individually merit that God himself should work in them. Soul as
   transcending body is too virgin- exquisite to set her heart on aught
   save pure Deity himself. But nothing enters there until it has been
   shorn of all additions. That is why she was answered, one God.'

   St Paul says, one God.' One is something more simple than good- ness
   and truth. Goodness and truth are constants, they are added to (only)
   in thought ; thinking attributes things to them. There is no addition
   to the one as proceeding in himself into the Son and into the Holy
   (ihost. He said, F riend, go up higluir.' A master says. One is the
   denial of denials. If I say God is good, that is an anirmation. One is
   tlie denial of denials, t he grave of expecta- tions. What does one
   mean ? That to which nothing is added. The soul receives Godhead as
   told forth in her, unadded to, unthought. One is the denial of denials.
   Every creature makes innate denial ; the one denies it is the othir ;
   an angel denies being any other creature. But (iod makes the denial of
   denials ; he is one and denies all other, for th(r( is notliing without
   God. All creatures are in God ; they are his very Godhead, that is to
   say, the fullness. He is the Father of all deity. One God, not
   proceeding, unmoved, unmindful of the Word. By the fact of denying God
   something -- and by denying God goodness I am not denying God, -- (I
   say), by denying God something 1 conceive something about him, that he
   is not ; even this has to go. God is one, he is the negation of
   negations. According to one master, the angelic nature secretes no
   power nor work, it has no know- ledge save of God alone. Everything
   else it ignores. As he says, one God and Father of all.'

   Some of the powers of the soul take in from without, as, for example,
   the eye. Though it lets in but little, rejecting the great bulk, yet it
   is dependent on and does receive something from outside in the mode of
   here and now. But intelligence and intellect, paring to the core, seize
   what is neither here nor now. In her unconditioned state she is right
   in touch with nature, but she still receives from the senses ; what the
   senses bring in from outside the intellect uses. Not so the will ; in
   this respect will ranks above the intellect. Will accepts nothing save
   in abstract understanding, where there is neither here nor now. God
   intends to convey what a pure and exalted thing will is. It rises to

   familiar colloquy with God, and God says, Friend, come up higher,
   honour waits thee.'

   The will wills happiness. It has been asked, what is the differ- ence
   between grace and happiness. Grace, as we are now in this life, and
   happiness as ours to be hereafter in eternal life, are to one another
   as the flower to its fruit. When the soul is brimming with grace and
   nothing is left her, then grace works to perfect all that exists in the
   soul ; not that it comes to actual work, but by its mere presence in
   the soul what the soul does grace makes perfect. Grace docs no work
   but, all-pouring, pours all at once into the soul. The third grace
   atones the soul with God. Its consumma- tion, its effect, is to bring
   back the soul to God ; hers, after the blossom, the fruit. Will, as the
   will to happiness, as the will to be with God and the actual ascent, in
   this singleness (of heart) God slips into the will, and the single mind
   seeing God as the truth, God slips into the intellect, llut his
   entering into the will raises it up. As he says, one God. Friend, come
   up higher.' One God : God's unity is the crown of God's divinity. God
   could never bear his one- begotten Son were he not one. The fact of
   being one determines all he docs crcaturcly and godly. Oneness belongs
   to God alone ; God's idiosyiu^rasy is oneness ; God must be one God or
   not be God at all. llivinc riches or wisdom or truth, it is all the
   same thing in God ; it is not one, it is unity. God has all he has in
   him ; it is one with him. Theo- logians say that heaven revolves with
   the object of gathering all things in ; hence its rapid motion. lie
   said, Friend, come up higher, thou art honoured.' It is the honour and
   adornment of the soul that God is one. God behaves as though he existed
   for no purpose but to please the soul ; as though he did adorn himself
   solely in order to attract the soul. And man desires now one thing now
   another ; he cultivates now wisdom and now art. If she has nothing of
   the one she will never rest ; (she will never rest) till she is all the
   same in God. God is one ; that is the soul's beati- tude, her ornament,
   her rest. A philosopher says, God orders all things in his operation.
   The soul is all things, and in all respects the noblest and highest and
   God pours in all at once ; God is one.

   IN ALL THINGS I SEEK REST Part I

   she finds thee. In all created things, which I search

   in understanding, there is no refuge for my soul, but in thee, God,
   alone. In the love-spring of thy substance are gathered up to one the
   perfections of all creatures, which in them are scattered and divided.'
   Were there any single creature with all creaturely perfections both in
   quality and number then God would not have made more than that one
   alone, as I have pointed out in my discourse, Whosoever would follow me
   let him take up his cross.' Now the whole happiness of creatures
   depends on resting in the sovran good which is the fount of all good
   things, and hence our Lady Mary says these words about herself wherein
   she counsels our interior man to cultivate in lowliness the habit of
   divine repose in which the soul is most of all united, and without it
   not. She says, In all things have I sought rest for my inner man.'

   In this connection mark how the divine esseiu^c carries pent up in
   itself all creaturely perfection, creaturely existence being the
   reflection of God's essence. St .John says, Quod factum esty in ijjso
   vita erat : that which was made, in God was life. Creatures in their
   pre-existing form in God have been divine life for ever. Hence the
   opening words of our quotation from the Book of Wisdom, all things,'
   mean that our Lady sf)ught [)eaee for her inner man iu the eternal good
   of the divine nature wherein as in a magic mirror creature-nature as a
   whole is one in God eternally. Referring to the paradigm of all things
   in God, they being one divinity.

   Theologians put three fundamental questions about these pre- existing
   forms in God, whereto attach some admirable doctrines and stimulating
   facts. The first question is, whether ideas of all the creatures exist
   in God eternally or not ? The second question is, whether these ideas
   arc one or more in number ? The third question is, whether the divine
   mind has ideas of all the things it knows or does it know at all
   without ideas ?

   To the first question Doctor Thomas answers that, it is necessary to
   suppose in the divine being ideas of all the creatures. And his
   argument is this. The three terms, form, idea and semblance are
   identical in meaning. Now the form, idea or semblance of a thing, a
   rose for instance, is present in my soul and must be for two reasons.
   One is, because from the appearance of its mental form I can paint the
   rose in corporal matter, so there must be an image of the rose-form in
   my soul. The second reason is, because from the subjective rose-idea I
   recognise the objective rose although I do not copy it. Just as I can
   carry in my head the notion of a house I never mean to build. In both
   these ways [Le. as types and principles of knowledge] ideas exist in
   God, for with all natural things it is the rule for the natural form or
   char- acter of the progeny or fruit to exemplify the type belonging to

   its species ; as with mankind, for instance, the generative power of
   the father's manhood is repeated in the son's born manhood so that a
   man breeds men, a lion lions and a falcon falcons. The rose grows on a
   rose-bush not a cabbage-stalk ; fire engenders fire.

   And sometimes the idea of the work is in the practical power not as a
   natural species but theoretically, as the house of wood and stone is
   designed in the architect's practical mind, who makes the outward house
   as much like his ideal as he can. Now since God created this whole
   world (not that all creatures are by natural birth descended from God's
   nature like the eternal Word of the Father, for in that case all
   creatures would be God, which no sane mind allows : creature-nature
   rejects it as an impossible, false thing), therefore God created all
   creatures by practical understanding of divine nature. So there must be
   eternally in the divine understanding the pre-existing form or idea to
   the likeness of which God created this creature and not another whereof
   God had no pattern in his mind.

   The second question is, whether the idea is one or more in number ? To
   this the Doctor answers that, the ultimate end of the work is ever the
   real intention of the work's first cause. Now the ultimate end of the
   world is its good, i.e. the divine ordering of all creatures, as
   Aristotle says. Hence this ordering of the world must be eternally
   foreknown and foreordained in God, who is its first cause. Ergo, he has
   in him the particular ideas appropriate to that order, whence it
   follows that he must carry in him ideas of individual creatures. For
   just as no architect can carry in his head the plan of a whole house
   without the plans of all its details, so there must be in God as many
   forms as there are natural grades of created things emanating from him
   ; the rose, for instance, has one special form, the violet another; man
   has one distinctive type, an angel has another, and so with other
   things.

   The astonishing thing is that this multiplicity of forms should consist
   with the simplicity of God in whom all essential things arc one. We can
   explain it thus. The idea of the work exists in the worker's practical
   mind as an object of his understanding which regards it as expressing
   his idea to which he forms the material work, and is not in the mind of
   the worker as a form of under- standing informing his mind and setting
   up active intellection. The plan of the house in the architect's mind
   is (something under- stood by him). It is not repugnant to the
   simplicity of divine understanding to see and understand more than one
   thing as object. But it would be repugnant to his simple nature if by a
   plurality of objective forms it were stimulated and reduced to the
   subjective act of understanding as opposed to the mirror of God's

   essence. Countless ideas exist in God in the sense that he sees and
   understands them, not in the sense that his intellect sees in them. To
   resume. God knows his essence perfectly so far as it is knowable both
   in itself and so far as all creatures in their natural mode are
   exemplified in divine essence ; and this express image of all creatures
   in the divine essence is their prototype, their idea. It follows that
   there are as many types as there are grades of nature to be typified.

   With regard to this question of how the countless forms in the divine
   essence consist with their being the essence of God, they being many in
   number and the essence of God only one, it may be looked at in this
   way. We call these ideas the essence of God, not as such but inasmuch
   as the essence of God is a mirror reflecting all creatures. And since
   in the impartible essence of God we have the exemplar of all things,
   which we call their idea, therefore the form is many and the essence
   only one. Even as in a mirror there are many forms reflected, but an
   eye placed in the mirror would see all these forms as one object of its
   vision ; they would not be innate in it nor would they form the eye's
   intrinsic faculty of active present or passive and potential sight, for
   in that case the image would be no more than one.

   The third question was, whether God has in him ideas of all the things
   he knows or does he know at all without ideas ? Doctor Thomas answers
   this as follows : These pre-existing forms are the origin or principle
   of the creation of all creatures, and in this sense they are types and
   pertain to practical knowledge. These forms, again, are the principle
   of all knowledge of creatures and as such they are really essential
   images of creatures ; wherefore of everything he knows and his
   conception of it he must have ideas.

   This fact prompts the question. How does God know evil, which has no
   being in itself but is a privation of being ? The answer is this. As I
   said above, all creaturely existence has its idea in God, but since
   evil or sin has no being that is aught (as Dionysius says), but
   deprives good of good or virtuous being, as blindness of eye has no
   positive existence but it deprives the eye of sight, even so God's mind
   perceives all sin and evil in the idea of the corresponding good, not
   in the form of sin ; for instance, he knows lying in the idea of truth.

   Consider next how God knows virtue. In the eternal mirror of his works
   God knows all creaturely perfections both natural and ghostly,
   perceiving in their pre-existing forms all accidents as substantial
   being. But accidents are various. Basic character- istics of the
   abiding nature of their subject God has no ideas of apart from the
   ideas which are proper to their subject : the whiteness of the daisy,
   for example, not its whiteness as a separate

   254

   MEISTER ECKHART

   idea. But accidents subsequently added to the abiding nature he knows
   in particular ideas apart from the idea of any host. Whence it follows
   that all noble human attributes like acquired virtues and spiritual
   wisdom, God knows in separate eternal forms reflecting the wisdom and
   virtue of souls in general.

   Moreover, since grace is not natural to creature therefore grace is
   communicated to the soul in the guise of accident, and by the same
   token, faith and other godly virtues are inspired super- naturally in
   the soul, and love and sometimes divine wisdom as with the prophets and
   apostles. Again, the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are supernaturally
   instilled into the soul. And spiritual sweetness too is an inspired
   accident. Wherefore of all the graces in mere creatures God has ideas
   wherein he knows the contingencies of grace.

   In the divine essence there exist then also particular ideas reflecting
   the certainty or hope and divine charity of the soul, albeit she is but
   a creature. In their own ideas there exist as well all the gifts of the
   Holy Ghost, which have an adventitious character. This I affirm because
   the prime gift of love wherein he gives all gifts, this love he is
   himself in Person and in essence. And because, again, all the sacred
   rites of the seven sacraments, wherein the soul is sanctified and
   initiated into godly life, because all these were instituted to show
   forth the workings of grace in the soul, therefore God must know all
   the seven sacraments in eternal pre-existing forms and each in a
   distinct one. The cathartic virtue of baptism by natural water comes
   springing out of the eternal formal baptism of the mirror of God's
   nature. So, too, the primordial perfect conception of that nature
   survives in marriage, wherein the mutable nature of the father is
   reborn into the immortal and impersonal nature of the soul of his
   child, where nature, no longer ridden by the race-instinct governing
   creatures, is in that sense performing the work of all creation.
   Marriage is true to its exemplar as long as we preserve it in its
   natural purity and free from animal intention which is all opposed to
   its divine ideal. And the same I say about the other sacraments. God
   then has ideas of every longing, love and godly intuition, whether of
   sweetness or of inwardness, wherein he feels and knows at once all thy
   desires when thou dost call on him in prayer ; and in these same ideas
   the soul of any saint whom we invoke sees all our prayerful longings
   from the beginning of the world down to the very end in one flash of
   God's essence, just as an angel sees creatures and their prototype in
   God all at once in the vision of God, in the dawn, not in the evening
   light, or else they would not know our longing for them. Here ends the
   first part of this sermon.

   Part II'

   Now it must be remembered that this rest of the inner man in the divine
   wonder born of vision and divine love, transcends in its perfection and
   its sweetness any activity of the outward man, and for nine reasons.

   The first reason is, because in this passivity of the interior man,
   which is one of knowing and loving, the highest of the faculties in man
   are engaged in their noblest and most proper occupation and are thus
   detached and free from everything temporal and mor- tal, and these
   powers are knowledge and love. The life of the exterior man, on the
   other hand, is one of varying sensation. St Gregory says that Rachel,
   meaning the interior life, signifies a vision of the source, but Leah,
   the other sister, means the life of the exterior man, for she had weak
   eyes.

   The second reason is, that man's interior wont of love and con-
   templation is more lasting, though not at the culminating point of
   actual vision, for the moment of supreme illumination is short- lived,
   and passes like a flash of lightning. According to St Augus- tine, the
   common use of love and knowledge lasts longer with the inner man than
   with the outer.

   The third reason is, because man's inner life of rest and spiritual
   leisure is somewhat like the peace of the divine eternal essence ; for
   albeit the Father is ever in the act of engendering his Word that does
   not disturb his rest ; as our Lord says, My Father worketh until now.'
   The life of outward man, on the other hand, is one of perpetual
   physical unrest. Mary sat still and Martha kept about the house.

   The fourth reason is, that the interior life is more self-sufficient
   than that of outward man. The inner man needs nothing for his work but
   the freedom from bodily affairs which comes with detachment of the
   soul-powers, together with knowledge and love. The freer and less
   occupied with mortal tilings the better adapted to God is the life of
   the inner man. But the life of outward man has need of many things
   which are disturbing : of working and talking and giving and taking and
   eating and drinking. St Luke tells us how Martha, meaning the outward
   man, was cum- bered with overmuch serving ; aye, though it be all on
   God's account, like works of mercy, natheless it entails a deal of
   trouble.

   The fifth reason is, that the interior life is infinitely more
   enjoyable than that of outward man. As the philosopher says,
   Intellectual delights are free from drawbacks, but every mortal

   pleasure has its other side. St Augustine says that while Martha was
   distraught Mary was in company with her interior man. Hence the comment
   of one teacher, Mary taxed Martha before the eternal Word Christ
   Jesus.' Why did not Mary answer ? She did not hear, because she was not
   at home by herself. Where was she then ? She was with her inner man in
   the Word whose word she was attending to. For the soul is where she
   loves rather than where she is giving natural life.

   The sixth reason is, because the interior life, apart from know- ledge
   and apart from love, is desirable in itself. But the outward life is
   desirable only in so far as it makes for the greater good of the soul.
   The prophet cries, One thing have I desired of the Lord and that same
   will I seek : to see God's will and behold his godly habitation.'

   The seventh reason is, because the inner life is concerned with things
   divine and the outer with things human. St Augustine says, Mary heard
   the Word in the beginning, whereas it was the human word that Martha
   served.

   The eighth reason is, because the inner life is that of the powers most
   proper to the soul. But the powers used for outward purposes we have in
   common with the brutes, the senses, namely. David says, Lord thou dost
   nourish man and beast.' And later on he adds, but I^ord, we men shall
   sec thy light in the light of thine own self,' that is, in the light of
   understanding whereby man is distinguished from the brutes.

   The ninth reason is given by our Lord himself, who says, Mary has
   chosen the better part.' St Augustine says, Martha had no bad one ;
   hers was a good one too, though Mary had the best.' Hers the uses of
   the inner man, which starting here go on eternally. But the outward
   life of works of mercy ends where there is no poverty nor woe, that is,
   in eternity. Now though the inner life is intrinsically best, the
   outward life is sometimes better, as in cases of bodily necessity ; to
   feed the hungry, for example, were better than to spend the time in
   contemplation. According to one teacher, to see a man in any need and
   fail to help would make me guilty towards him, and St Augustine says I
   ought to lend him aid. In cases then of real necessity, to use the
   works of the outward man for the relief of one's own self or neighbour
   is better than to settle down to the interior man's spiritual idleness
   of mind and will. -- It is now explained how our Lady rested in the
   eternal good. Let us too seek rest for the inner man as well as for the
   outer. So help us God. Amen.

   HONOUR THY FATHER

   Hcec dicit dominus : honora patrem tuum etc, {Matt I54). This Latin
   quotation is taken from the gospel. The words were spoken by our Lord,
   and the translation runs, Honour thy father and mother.' And another
   commandment is given by God our Lord,

   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods nor his house nor anything
   that is his.' The third point is that the people went to Moses and
   said, Do thou speak to us, for we cannot hear God.* The fourth, that
   God said to Moses, An altar of earth and in earth shalt thou make unto
   me and all that is offered thereon thou shalt burn away.' The fifth is
   that Moses went into the cloud and ascending into the mountain there he
   found God : it was in the darkness that he found the true light.

   There is a saying of St Augustine's, Where the lamb sinks there swims
   the ox and the cow and where the cow swims the elephant runs and forges
   ahead.' Which is a pretty parable to draw a moral from. The scriptures
   arc the deep sea, St Augustine says, and the little lamb the humble,
   simple soul which is able to fathom Holy Writ. By the ox that swims we
   understand ill- tutored folk : each choosing out of them the things
   that suit himself. But in the elephant that goes ahead we recognise
   wise souls searching the scriptures and making progress in them. I am
   amazed how full the scriptures are withal the masters say they are not
   to be taken merely as they stand ; the material things in them, they
   say, must be translated to a higher plane, for which we must have
   symbols. -- First it reached to the ankles, next it came up to the
   knee, thirdly it rose to the girdle, and fourthly it covered his head
   and he was submerged altogether.

   Now what does this mean ? St Augustine says, at first the scriptures
   will amuse and attract the child, and in the end, when he tries to
   understand them, they make fools of the wise, for none is so
   simple-minded but can find his level there nor none so wise but when he
   tries to fathom them will find they are beyond his depth and discover
   more therein. All the stories and quotations taken from them have
   another, esoteric, meaning. Our under- standing of them is as totally
   unlike the thing as it is in itself and as it is in God, as though it
   did not exist.

   To return to our text. Honour thy father and mother,' and in a general
   sense it does mean father and mother, that we ought to honour them, and
   all who have spiritual power are to be honoured and preferred as well
   as the authors of thy temporal weal. Herein we wade, herein do we touch
   bottom ; but it is precious little we

   get out of it. It is a woman who says, If we ought to honour the
   authors of our outward good much more are we behoven to magnify the
   author of it all.' What we have here outwardly in multiplicity is all
   within and one. Yours to make this likeness like unto the Father. I was
   thinking this evening that all likeness ends in sameness with the
   Father. In the second place, thou oughtest to honour thy father,
   meaning thy heavenly Father, the source of thy being. Who honours the
   Father ? None but the Son : he alone does him honour. And none honours
   the Son save only the Father. The Father's whole love, his fondness,
   his favours, are for the Son and him only. The Father knows nothing at
   all but the Son. Such delight does he take in his Son that he wants
   nothing else but to be getting his Son, for he is his exact likeness,
   the perfect image of his Father.

   The teaching of our school is that anything known or born is an image.
   They say that in begetting his only-begotten Son the Father is
   producing his own image abiding in himself, in the ground of the image,
   as it has ever been in him, {formce illius) ix, his immanent form. It
   is contrary to nature and seems to me irrational, the doctrine that God
   is known by likeness, by this thing or by that. For he, after all, is
   neither this nor that, and father is not satisfied till he returns to
   his first nature, to the innermost, to the ground and core of
   fatherhood, where he has been for ever in himself, in his father-nature
   : to where he enjoys him- self in the Father as the Father does himself
   in the one alone. Here wood, stone, grass-blades, all things are the
   same. This is the best of all, and I have fooled myself therein. All
   the natural powers being gathered to a head are plunged into the
   Father- nature, so that they are one, one Son, transcending all the
   rest and subsisting alone in the paternal nature, or if not the one
   they are at least the image of the one. This nature, being of God,
   seeks not what is outside her, nay, this nature, existing in itself,
   has naught to do with ornament : nature which is of God seeks none
   other than God's likeness.

   I was thinking this evening that a likeness is an outwork (preamble). I
   cannot see a thing unless it has some likeness, some relation to me,
   neither can I know a thing excepting it is like me. God has all things
   hidden in himself ; not this and that distinct but one in the same
   nature. The eye is coloured and also receives colour, the ear not. The
   ear senses tone and the tongue has taste. It is a case of like to like.
   The form of the soul and God's image have the same nature : we being
   sons. If I had neither eyes nor ears still I might have being. Who robs
   me of my eyes robs me not therefore of my being nor yet of my life, for
   my life is seated in the heart. A blow aimed at my eye I parry by a
   lifting of the

   hand. A blow at my heart I should stop with any portion of my body. But
   if someone attempted to cut off my head I should hit out straight from
   the shoulder in order to preserve my life and being.

   I am fond of saying, You must break the outside to let out the inside :
   to get at the kernel means breaking the shell. Even so to find nature
   herself all her likenesses have to be shattered and the further in the
   nearer the actual thing. On coming to one, where it is all one, she is
   the same. Who honours God ? He who is ever seeking God's glory.

   Many years ago I was not ; not long after that my father and my mother
   eating bread and meat and the vegetables growing in the garden, I
   became a man. In this my father and my mother were unable to assist,
   but God made my body without aid and created my soul after the supreme.
   Thus I became possessed of life {possecli me). This grain of rye has it
   in its nature to develop into wheat, and it never rests until it has
   that nature. This corn seed has it in its nature to be all things and
   pays the penalty of death in order to be all things. And this metal,
   copper, has it in its nature to be gold, and it will never rest till it
   has gotten that same nature. Aye, this wood has in its nature the power
   of turning into stone ; I say more than that : it may indeed become all
   things if put into the fire and allowed to burn away and be transmuted
   to the firc-nature ; then same comes to same and has eternally one
   being. I trow that wood and stone and bone and all the grasses have
   collectively one being in the first nature. And if so with this nature
   then how about the nature which is so intrinsically pure that it seeks
   not either this or that but transcending all the others is simply
   making for its primitive perfection ?

   I was thinking this evening, there arc many heavens. There are some
   incredulous who will not believe that this bread upon the altar may be
   changed, that God can do it. (How unworthy, to deny that God is capable
   of this.) If God has given to nature the power to be all things, how
   much easier to him must be the changing to his body of this altar
   bread. If this frail nature from a drop of blood can contrive a man,
   how much more possible for God to make his body from a bit of bread.
   Who honours God ? He who is ever seeking God's glory. This meaning is
   more obvious albeit the former is the better one.

   the dark : in suffering and travail this light is nearest to us, Let
   God do his best or his worst he is bound to give himself to us whether
   in travail or distress. There was once a pious dame with many sons,
   whom they sought to slay. Smiling she said, * Grieve not, be of good
   cheer and remember your heavenly Father, for from me ye have gotten
   nothing whatsoever.* As though to say, Ye have your being straight from
   God. This applies to us. Our Lord said, Thy darkness {ix. thy
   suffering) shall be turned into bright light.' But I must not love nor
   covet it. It was said by a master in another place, The mysterious
   darkness of the invisible light of the eternal Deity is unknown and
   never shall be known.* And the light of the eternal Father has ever
   ^been shining in this darkness and the darkness comprehends not the
   light. May we arrive at this eternal light. So help us God. Amen.

   OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH

   Ex oro altissimi prodivi (EccL 24^). These words, which I have quoted
   in Latin, we may speak in the Person of the eternal Word. He says, I
   proceeded forth out of the mouth of the Most High.' This is the exalted
   source which uttered from the Father's heart the eternal Word which
   took on human nature in our Lady's womb. Not of this carnal birth am I
   going to tell, for much is told you of it. It is on the eternal birth
   that I propose to speak, and I will broach the subject by answering two
   questions.

   The first one is. Whether the eternal Word can be called the perfect
   Word seeing it is still in the throes of birth ? -- Yes, for the
   eternal Word is gotten in the essential light and abides therein,
   untold to anything outside it, and is withal infallibly uttered by the
   Father. Hence it may well be called the perfect Word.

   The second question is. Whether our intelligence can at all conceive
   the perfect Word ? for it is proper to every under- standing that it
   should understand. Is it not the same as our understanding in itself?
   -- I say no, because our word is gotten in a fitful light. Our
   understanding is a changing thing, so it cannot conceive a perfect
   word. The word you hear from me is not infallible, it is a sign of the
   Word within me.

   Now mark the way of the eternal birth. The Personal under- standing as
   confined to its unity of nature is one with the under- standing whereby
   the Father understands himself in his char- acteristic nature. Were
   this not the case there would be two intelligible essences. But there
   are not : there is but one intelli- gible essence wherein the Father
   sees himself in his characteristic

   261

   nature. The object of his thought is the eternal Word. Where this is
   confined to the natural understanding of the Father it is none other
   than the Father- nature. Where this same Word is directed to itself
   there is ever distinction of Person and withal one simple essence
   divine in nature. Here I will put four questions the better for you to
   understand the mode of the eternal birth, though, let me say at once,
   that this is inconceivable to the multi- tudinous mind. However, I will
   tell you as much as it is possible for your minds to grasp.

   The first question is, Why is the Person of the Son called born and the
   Person of the Father not ? The answer is, that it is the personal
   understanding of the Father wherewith he understands himself in his
   characteristic nature, but the product of this con- ception is the
   eternal Word. Hence the eternal Word is said to be begotten and the
   Person of the Father not. -- Question two : Is the work of the eternal
   birth wrought by his personal power or by his natural power ? Some
   theologians say it is due to the personal power of the Father since it
   is proper to all begotten things to receive the same nature they arc
   gotten by. Where saw ye the father that imparted not his own nature to
   his son ? So runs the argument for the eternal birth being due to
   personal power. This is not my view. Where the personal understanding
   keeps to its unity of nature there is this nature Person. Now the
   eternal Word originates in the essential thought wherein the Father
   understands himself in his characteristic nature. It follows that the
   work of the eternal birth must be due to his natural power, for if the
   eternal Word sprang from the personal understanding of the Father then
   this eternal Word would be the cause of its own self, for this
   conception is the Word.

   The third question is. Where does the Father-nature have maternal names
   ? Where it does maternal work. Where personal understanding keeps to
   its unity of nature and has intercourse therewith, there the
   Father-nature has maternal names and is doing mother's work, for it is
   exclusively a mother's work to receive the seed of the eternal Word. In
   essential thought the mother- nature has paternal names and docs
   paternal work.

   The fourth question is. Whether this work is essential or does the
   Father play a casual part therein ? I say, no. If he stopped a single
   instant he would negate himself. For the eternal Word is the image of
   the Father as he conceives himself in his character of Person, with the
   added dignity which the eternal Word receives in its own Person, all
   the perfection which the Father has and all the omnipotence peculiar to
   his nature. The heretical doctor Arius observes concerning this ; It
   appears to me to be untrue that the eternal Word receives all the
   perfection that the Father

   262

   MEISTER ECKHART

   has and all the omnipotence peculiar to his nature, for it cannot do
   what the Father does ; he cannot beget another Son. But as St Augustine
   says, That he does not beget another Son is not due to impotence, but
   it behoves him not to. A statement which some doctors misconstrue,
   giving to understand that the Son an he would could beget another Son.
   Which is erroneous, for in that case the Person of the Son would be the
   Person of the Father. The reason for not doing it is this. Each Person
   receives the same nature albeit variously : the Father as fatherhood,
   the Son as sonship and the Holy Ghost as the common product of them
   both. Here the Persons are an hypostasis of the nature, each Person
   receiving the one nature all at once as essence. Where (the Word)
   receives its dignity the three shine with one light, they having this
   light as their common being. The dignity the eternal Word receives by
   birth is that of being equal with the Father, for it springs from the
   essential conception of the Father. As con- fined to this conception it
   is none other than divine nature ; in its aspect of the Word it is
   distinct in Person and withal in nature one impartible essence.

   Here arises the question. How can the eternal Word be at once discrete
   and one simple essence divine in nature ? The best answer theologians
   have to this is that it is due to the imparti- bility and simplicity of
   that nature. The entire content of divine nature is one impartible
   essence which operates by divine nature. May we attain this oneness so
   far as it is possible to us. So help us God. Amen.

   CIV

   SUFFERING

   I say that next to God there is no nobler thing than suffering. Were
   there anything more noble than suffering the heavenly Father would have
   given it to his Son Jesus Christ, in exemplary fashion, for all things.
   We find in Christ, as regards his manhood, nothing so much as
   suffering. Suffering was with him at his birth, and it never left him
   while he was here on earth. I say, moreover, that had Christ been a man
   upon this earth without his deity, yet would he have been noble beyond
   all human ken by reason of his suffering; for granting that suffering
   is noble, he who has most suffering is the noblest. But no human
   suffering was equal to Christ's passion. And he is the more noble in
   proportion to it. Again I hold, if anything were nobler than suffering,
   God would have saved mankind therewith, for we might well accuse him of
   being unfriendly to his Son if he knew of something superior to
   suffering. And I say, were not suffering

   268

   SERMONS AND COLLATIONS

   always noble, the heavenly Father would have left his Son some few
   hours on earth that were free from suffering. But we do not find that
   Christ on earth spent one single hour without suffering. Suffering then
   must be superior to all else. I ween that our Lady, God's mother,
   rather than that she should be deprived of the reward attached to the
   least instant of her suffering at sight of her child's martyrdom, would
   choose to have remained here upon earth and not behold God till the
   judgment day, provided that would win back this reward. So great the
   guerdon won in that short hour.

   I declare, all the humility and virtue we attribute to our Lady brought
   her no such great reward or love of God as the least of all the
   sufferings that God sent her. I say that if our Lady, God's mother, and
   suffering stood together in the street and with our Lady all her earned
   reward for chastity, humility and her other virtues except suffering :
   to our Lady suffering would appear as lovely as sunshine in a burrow,
   for in that case she would be out- side God. And again, I say : suppose
   a man committed a sin beyond all sins, it might involve a suffering
   wherein by virtuous conduct he could cancel all his sin and win greater
   merit in God's eyes than any of his saints. Further, I maintain, no man
   apart from God has ever been so holy or so good as to deserve the least
   nobility such as the smallest suffering would give. Given one man
   endowed with the collective humility and virtues of all the people who
   have lived since God created the first man, he, for all his virtues,
   would not merit the reward a man wins by a little suffering. I tell
   you, right suffering is the mother of all virtues, for right suffering
   so subdues the heart, it cannot rise to pride but perforce is lowly.
   And suffering makes for chastity ; for in right suffering vice is burnt
   away. And to one who has mastered all the virtues, suffering is the
   mother of virtue as a whole. Noth- ing makes a man so like God as
   suffering. For he who has least vices is the most like God. But nothing
   is like suffering for killing a man's vices. Ergo, it makes man
   Godlike. Finally I say, not all the theologists together could describe
   what profit, what glory lies in suffering. Suffering alone is
   sufficient prepara- tion for God's dwelling in man's heart. God dwells
   only with the sinless. But suffering exorcises sin. Hence God is always
   with a man in suffering ; as he himself declared by the mouth of the
   prophet, Whosoever is sorrowful, I will myself be with him.'

   [Peradventure thou wilt say, If it be a fact that suffering is so noble
   and profits one so much, why are not the Jews and heathens saved ? I
   see and hear a great deal of their sufferings, for as captives they are
   ever subject to the Christians and that

   causes them much suffering.' I answer. Baptism is the basis of the
   welfare, the salvation, of mankind. In the absence of it, virtues and
   good works are not rewarded with eternal grace. And since the Jews are
   not baptized, they have no guerdon of eternal grace, but are accursed
   on earth as well as in the other world.] ^ But thou mayst object, Why
   is it that all Christians are not saved ; they are all God's, and there
   is nobody on earth but is bound to suffer in some fashion ? My answer
   is, There are two kinds of sufferers. Some, when suffering befalls,
   take it not as if it came from God ; they resist it to the utmost,
   saying in their hearts. What have I done to God that he should visit me
   with such misfortune ? and are moved to tears. Not that in this thought
   they are to blame, but in other cases they chide God vehemently,
   whereas God sends the suffering to rid them of their sins and by not
   accepting it in the proper spirit they make it useless to them ; and to
   such as these there is no reward for suffering though they are always
   having it ; they scorn God's gift and thrust it from them. And they
   chase away God too, albeit they fain would have him. On the other hand,
   some people take it as from God, when their suffering comes, and send
   it back to God. They take it from God, saying in their hearts ; God, T
   accept this suffering from no one else but thee, for my sins have
   thoroughly deserved it. And they send their suffering back to God,
   saying in their hearts. Lord God, I willingly contribute all the
   suffering thou hast suffered from the hour of thy birth down to the
   very end ; for thou wert a pure and sinless soul, yet wert in great
   affliction ; it is more fit that I should be afflicted, I who am a man
   in sin. Accepting suffering thus, a man will merit the eternal kingdom.
   God help us to attain it. Amen.

   ^ This is probably a gloss which has become incorporated in the text.

   THE KINGDOM OF GOD

   Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and
   all things shall be added unto you.' Since Christ bids us seek the
   kingdom of God it is our duty to know what this kingdom is. Know then
   that God's kingdom is himself and his perfect nature. Secondly, there
   is God's kingdom in the soul. He himself says :

   The kingdom of God is within you.'

   Consider this first kingdom. Thcologists say that God's kingdom is
   unity of essence in a trinity of Persons. The question is, where is God
   happiest ? I answer that God's happiness is all alike in him according
   to his unity but according to our under- standing God is far happier in
   his unity of essence than in his trinity of Persons, as we will prove.
   According to some theolo- gists there arc three kinds of distinctions
   in the Godhead. First, rational distinctions ; secondly, formal
   distinctions ; and thirdly real distinctions, to wit, the mutual
   relations of the Persons. Others say the Godhead has no more than two
   kinds of distinc- tions, rational and real.

   Take first the distinction of Persons. St John says ; In the beginning
   was the Word.' This beginning or origin is the Father, as St Augustine
   says. The question is, has the Father a begin- ning ? The answer is ;
   yes, his beginning is primary not pro- ceeding, as I will show.
   Thcologists teach that we must distin- guish in the Godhead between
   essence and being (i.e, nature). Being in the Godhead is deity itself
   and is the first thing we apprehend about God. Deity is the whole basis
   of divine per- fection. The Godhead in itself is motionless unity and
   balanced stillness and is the source of all emanations. Hence I assume
   a passive welling-up. We call this first utterance heing^ for the most
   intrinsic utterance, the first formal assumption in the Godhead is
   being : being as essential word. God is being, but being is not God.

   Now the origin of the Father is necessarily involved in this assumption
   of a passive welling-up. In other words, the deity being in itself
   intelligence, therefore the divine nature steps forth

   ^ Jostes, No. 82.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   into relation of otherness : other but not another, for this distinc-
   tion is rational not real. Thus the first Person arises in the Godhead
   passively, not from any active beginning. Hence its beginning is
   without property (or, Person).

   The question is, what is the Person of the Father ? I answer that it is
   being in the Godhead, not according to essence but according to
   paternity which is the formal notion specifically determining the
   Father. The Father is the beginning of the God- head. Hence, some
   theologists assert that if there were neither Son nor Holy Ghost in the
   Godhead there would still be the Person of the Father. When, therefore,
   St John says ; In the beginning was the Word,' we must not understand
   this beginning to be God's essence or his nature, for the Father alone
   is the active origin of the Son.

   Mark how the Son is in the Father. Theologists say that the Father
   looking into himself actually conceives in himself his own impartible
   exuberant nature. There follows the characteristic of that nature. The
   same nature which in the Father is active is receptive in the Son, for
   they participate it according to their properties.

   Ancnt this divine birth theologists teach that this word is to be taken
   in a two-fold sense : essential and j^ersonal. The first or essential
   word every Person possesses visually, but the Father possesses it both
   visually and really. And this same Word in Person is the Son. The same
   power which is active in the Father is passive in the Son, the Son
   receiving his divinity from the Father. Wc must understand the
   passivity begotten of passivity, divinity of divinity, as properties of
   the Persons by which the essence is determined. For saints and doctors
   teach that the Persons proceed from the essence as origin, the essence
   being determined by the Persons and the Persons by their properties. As
   paternity is the formal notion which specifically determines the Person
   of the Father, so filiation is the formal notion which distinguishes
   the Person of the Son. These formal notions signify the relationship of
   the Persons. And this property, this formal relationship of paternity
   and filiation, is the final attribute of divinity. Paternity and
   filiation are divine accidents and dependent properties.

   Mark how in this birth from the Father the Word remains within as
   essence and goes forth as Person. Philosophers teach that to every
   rational concept there succeeds an intelligible word. Now when the
   Father conceives himself in himself, his own nature is the object of
   his understanding. The Father observes himself and his nature has
   another property, that of being observed. Accordingly the Son remains
   within as essence and goes forth as

   Person. Corresponding with the divided nature of this act the Son is
   born and proceeds out of the paternal heart. Thus saith the Eternal
   Wisdom : I proceeded out of the mouth of the Most High,' to wit, out of
   the natural conception of the essential word of the divine Father. Not
   that there are in the Godhead two words really but only logically.

   The Word was with God.' That means, as a Person distinct from the
   Father, as here demonstrated.

   Observe further concerning these two how they bring forth the Holy
   Ghost. Theologists teach that the Father, pouring himself out as love
   into the Son, there his love is as it were reflected, the Son pouring
   himself back into the Father. This mutual outpour- ing of love is the
   common spiration of the Father and the Son. It might be thought that
   this spiration is identical in the two Persons but it is not. For
   according to its formal origin this spirative force is different in
   Father and Son, the Father being formally something other than the Son.
   But taking it, this spiration, both formally and really, it is the
   formal notion and the property which distinguishes the Person of the
   Holy Ghost. Hence the Holy Ghost proceeds from two formal sources as
   from one active origin.

   Then comes the question whether this property (Person) of the Holy
   Ghost results from the (divine) nature in the same way as the property
   of the Son does ? The answer is : no, for were that so the Holy Ghost
   must proceed by an act of nature, like the Son ; which is not the case,
   l^or then there would be two Sons in the Godhead. But the divine nature
   is posterior to the property of the Holy Ghost which proceeds by
   spiration of the free-will. Hence were it possible to separate the
   nature from the Person of the Holy Ghost in the Godhead, the Holy Ghost
   would never- theless continue to subsist in itself apart from the
   nature. With the Son this would not be possible seeing that the Son
   emanates from the Father as an intelligible word proceeding from the
   act of the exuberant nature of the Father ; hence he could not exist
   apart from that nature. And as the nature is posterior to the Person of
   the Holy Ghost and as the Holy Ghost docs not subsist apart from that
   nature, so on the other hand it is true that the Person of the Son is
   posterior to the nature. The nature does not exist apart from the Son,
   for the Son is the image of the Father from whom he emanates naturally
   ; which the Holy Ghost does not, seeing that it emanates from his
   free-will. It follows that there is reciprocity only between paternity
   and flliation ; not the Holy Ghost. Howbeit the reciprocity of the
   spirative power common to the paternity and filiation is rational not
   real. Herein, noble soul, seek with understanding the kingdom of God.

   St John says : * And God was the word,' signifying unity of nature. Up,
   noble soul, arise in divine wonder at this exalted fellowship : the
   three Persons united in one impartible nature ! The prophet says : The
   Lord shall reign for ever and beyond.' God reigns (for ever) in
   distinetion of Persons, but his reign in the beyond is in unity of
   nature. There God is the kingdom of himself, being super-essential.

   Then comes the question : Can the divine essence as essence, apart from
   those formal distinctions which philosophers call the eternal
   eternities, be God's happiness or that of creatures ? We answer : No !
   Essence as essence is the same in God and crea- tures, but God's
   happiness and the soul's also lies in the divine nature. For the divine
   nature subsists in itself with all its per- fections, to wit, the
   eternal eternities which are intrinsic in it. Some teach that it is
   possible for the soul to attain happiness in the knowledge of one of
   these formal relations regardless of the rest. But that is not true ;
   if it were, each of these formal relations must be established in
   itself apart from the others and detached from its divine nature, which
   is impossible ; hence this opinion is false. But the soul's beatitude
   consists in compre- hending all together, in one property, these
   eternal eternities which are the formal expression of the divine
   nature. For here is no division ; God is the superessential one, his
   own beatitude and that of all creatures in the actuality of his
   Godhead. Be sure that in this unity God knows distinctions but as one
   impartible property.

   In this unity God is idle. The Godhead effects neither this nor that ;
   it is God who effects all things. God in activity is manifold and knows
   multiplicity. God as one is absolutely free from activity. In this
   unity God knows nothing save that he superessentially is in his own
   self.

   Hence we understand : God was the word ' to refer to the unity of the
   essence. The same was in the beginning with God,' his equal in wisdom,
   in truth, in goodness and in all the essential perfections, to wit, the
   eternal eternities, the formal modes, the fullness of the divine
   essence. This superessential unity is what is meant by the divine
   kingdom which the spirit seeks with know- ledge and with love.

   Secondly, by this kingdom of God we understand the soul, for the soul
   is of like nature with the Godhead. Hence all that has been said here
   about the kingdom of God, how God is himself the kingdom, may be said
   with equal truth about the soul.

   St John says : All things were made by him.' This refers to the soul,
   for the soul is all things. The soul is all things in that she is an
   image of God and as such she is also the kingdom of

   God ; as God is essentially in himself without beginning so in the
   kingdom of the soul he is, as essence, without end. God,' says one
   philosopher, is in the soul in such a fashion that his whole Godhead
   hangs upon her.' It is far better for God to be in the soul than for
   the soul to be in God. The soul is not happy because she is in God, she
   is happy because God is in her. Rely upon it, God himself is happy in
   the soul, for God, when he broke out and wrought the soul, so far
   maintained his ground in her as to conceal in her his divine treasure,
   his heavenly kingdom. Hence Christ says : The kingdom of heaven is like
   a treasure hid in a field.' This field is the soul, wherein lies hidden
   the treasure of the divine kingdom. Accordingly God and all creatures
   are happy in the soul. What we say of the soul applies to her as being
   an image of God.

   Let us sec therefore wherein this image lies. One theologist says it
   lies in her powers, and this is commonly held to be true. And it is
   true when rightly understood. If it is taken to mean that her powers
   are diverse there is no ultimate truth in it, but if the powers are
   understood to be one at the summit of her activity then it is true. In
   this divine activity the soul looks back immedi- ately, intellectually,
   in the divine nature. In this divine act she conceives her own nature
   superessentially in God. In this act all is divine to the highest
   image, which in its proper activity it is very God and happy --
   formally, not objectively. For gazing into itself it simultaneously
   conceives God in himself, without means. Hence it is happy in him
   formally, and objectively owing to the divine nature. One doctor says
   that this supernal light flows immediately out of God and at the same
   instant by an act of intellection is gotten without means into God.
   Hence its going out of and persistence in God are one intellectual
   conception, the impartible nature of the same intelligent act. In God,
   be sure, the soul in its highest prototype has never known creature as
   creature nor has she ever therein possessed cither time or space. For
   in this image everything is God : sour and sweet, good and bad, small
   and great, all are one in this image. This image is no more changed by
   anything in time than the divine nature is changed by anything that is
   creature ; for it apprehends and uses all things according to the law
   of godhood.

   Now it may be asked : If this kingdom is in us why is it unknown to us
   ? To which I answer that, owing to the soul's natural disposition
   towards creatures, all her acts are bound to originate in creaturely
   images ; hence these acts are thought by some to be the seat of this
   image in the soul, though this is not the case. These persons little
   know the nobility of the soul, whose activity in her ordinary
   understanding originates in an intelligible image

   in highest thought (or, memory), begotten there as to form by
   phantasmal images and as to essence by the supernal, God-behold- ing
   image whence the soul receives power to understand all truth. In the
   train of this understanding comes the ordinary will, which is nothing
   but the bias of the mind. Now since the ordinary understanding takes
   things for true and the will takes them for good, things are the object
   of both these activities which are alien and remote from God. For God
   is neither good nor true. And as God is detached and free from all that
   creatures can understand, so also is the highest image of the Godhead.

   It is a question whether there is mutual regard between God and
   creatures ? I answer that, God has no regard to creatures, for God has
   no regard except towards himself ; but creatures have regard to God,
   for everything that ever issued from him is ever gazing back towards
   him. Apply this to the highest image. The instant it glanced out from
   God this highest image looked back again, with countenance unveiled
   conceiving the divine nature without means. From this act is gotten its
   whole existence. In this act this prototype is God and is called the
   image of God ; in its breaking forth it is a creature and is called the
   image of the soul.

   Consider then thyself, O noble soul, and the nobility within thee, for
   thou are honoured above all creatures in that thou art an image of God
   ; and despise what is mean for thou art destined to greatness !

   That is what is meant by the soul being the kingdom of God.

   Seek first the kingdom of God.' It should be our only care, our only
   quest, to know the nobility of God and the nobility of the soul. Let us
   see then how to seek the kingdom of God.

   In the Book of Love it is written : Knowest thou not thyself, O fairest
   among women ? Then go forth and follow after the footsteps of thy
   flocks ! ' These words refer to the soul ; she is the fairest of all
   creatures and she shall go forth in perceiving her own beauty. Now
   observe in the soul three sorts of going-forth out of three sorts of
   nature which she has. The first is her crea- turely nature. The second
   is the nature she has in the personal Word of the Trinity. The third is
   that which belongs to her in the exuberant nature functioning in the
   Father, the beginning of all creatures.

   Taking this first exodus, note how she has got to go out of her
   creaturely nature. Christ says ; If any man will come after me let him
   deny himself and follow me.' As surely as God lives, no man will ever
   go forth into the negation of himself until he is as free from his own
   self as he was when he was not. Doctors declare that man is to be
   knoA?m in two ways : as outward man and

   [Picture 301]

   TRACTATES

   278

   as inward man. The outward whose works are bodily and the inward whose
   works are ghostly. By the inner man God is sought in the contemplative
   life, by the outer man God is sought in the active life. Now mark my
   words. I say again what I have said before : outward disciplines arc of
   little worth ; they are useful only in subduing natures that are still
   uncontrolled. Know that the discipline of outward acts, though it
   subdue nature, cannot kill it. Nature dies by ghostly acts. There are
   many to be found who, with the best intentions, cling on to themselves,
   not denying themselves. Verily I say, these persons are mistaken, for
   it is contrary to human reason, contrary to the habit of grace and
   against the nature of the Holy Ghost. As for those who see their
   salvation in outward practices, I do not say they will be lost, but
   they will get to God only through hot cleansing fires ; for they follow
   not God who quit not themselves ; keeping hold of them- selves they
   follow their own darkness. God is no more to be found in any bodily
   exercise than in sin. Nevertheless those who make much practice of
   outward disciplines are greatly regarded by the eyes of the world ;
   which follows by analogy, for those who understand only that which is
   bodily esteem highly the life they can grasp with the senses. None but
   a fool would prize any other !

   Secondly, the work of the inner man is vision in knowing and loving. In
   this work lies the beginning of the holy life. These two activities
   define the nature of the soul. Doctors declare that every nature exists
   for the sake of its proper activity. Now since this nature (the soul)
   can be apprehended only in these two activities, therefore they are the
   noblest activities in man. I have said before that virtue is a mean
   between vice and perfection ; now love is the form of virtue without
   which no virtue is virtue. Whensoever a person practises a virtue the
   works of the virtue are works of love, not of the person ; each work of
   virtue having power in love to bring the person to God. St Dionysius
   says, it is the nature of love to change a man into that which he
   loves. Wherefore we ought so to live that our whole life is love. In
   this disposition all practices are praiseworthy, outward or inward.
   David says : They shall go from virtue to virtue, then shall the God of
   Gods be seen in Sion.' The vision of God transcends virtues. Virtue, as
   I said, is a mean between vice and perfection and the fruit of virtue
   -- the end and object of virtue, that is to say -- will never be
   obtained until the soul is caught up above the virtues. Be sure that as
   long as a man holds fast himself as thrall to virtue he will never
   taste the fruit of virtue, which is nothing else than seeing the God of
   Gods in Sion. God is not seen in Jacob, the practice of virtue, but God
   is seen in Sion. Sion

   is as it were a polished mirror and stands for unveiled vision with the
   single eye of the divine nature. Rely upon it, virtue has never seen
   this sight.

   Now it may be asked, are we to abandon virtue altogether ? To which I
   answer : no, we are to practise virtue, not possess it. The perfection
   of virtue is freedom from virtues. Thus Christ says : When ye have done
   all that is possible to you, say : we are unprofitable servants.'

   That is what is meant by the soul dying to her own works. The question
   we must now consider is how she loses her own nature. Doctors declare
   that everything made by God is ordered in such an excellent way that
   nothing can wish it did not exist. Yet the soul is to relinquish her
   existence. This means the death of the spirit. And in order to
   accomplish this death the soul must let go of herself and all things,
   retaining of herself and things no more than when she was not. Christ
   says : Except a corn of wheat die it abideth alone.' To die is to be
   wholly deprived of life, so that while a man lives, as long as there is
   life in him, be sure that he knows nothing of this death. St Paul says
   : I no longer live.' Some people interpret this death to mean that one
   must live neither in God nor in oneself nor yet in any creature. And so
   it does, for death is the loss of all life. But I say more : a man may
   be dead to everything, to God and crea- tures, yet if God still finds
   in his soul a place that he can live in, then the soul is not yet dead
   and gone out into that which follows created existence. For to die is,
   properly speaking, to lose everythfng. I do not say the soul is brought
   so utterly to naught as it was before it was created ; this naughting
   applies to holding and possessing. In this respect the soul suffers
   total loss -- God as well as creatures.

   It sounds strange to say the soul must lose her God, yet I affirm that
   in a way it is more necessary to perfection that the soul lose God than
   that she lose creatures. Everything must go. The soul must subsist in
   absolute nothingness. It is the full intention of God that the soul
   shall lose her God, for as long as the soul possesses God, is aware of
   God, knows God, she is aloof from God. God desires to annihilate
   himself in the soul in order that the soul may lose herself. For that
   God is God he gets from creatures. When the soul became a creature she
   obtained a God. When she lets slip her creaturehood, God remains to
   himself that he is, and the soul honours God most in being quit of God
   and leaving him to himself.

   This is the lowest death of the soul on her way to divinity. Such souls
   are hardly to be recognised for, as St Paul says : Ye are dead and your
   life is hid with Christ in God.' If it be ques-

   tioned whether the unique virtue of these souls finds no outward
   expression, I answer : Yes, just as Christ, the pattern of perfection,
   was unindigent and a shining light to all mankind, so these men are
   turned towards humanity by reason of their selfless wisdom and godlike
   frame of mind.

   So much for the first exodus in which the soul goes out of her
   creaturely nature seeking the kingdom of God.

   Secondly, she must go out of the nature she has in her eternal
   prototype. Theologists teach that the prototype of the soul is the
   divine understanding. The divine understanding is the Person of the
   Son. Hence the Son is the exemplar of all creatures and the image of
   the Father in which image broods the nature of all creatures. Now when
   the soul strips off her created nature there flashes out its uncreated
   prototype wherein the soul discovers herself in uncreatedness, for
   things arc all one in this prototype according to the property of the
   (eternal) image.

   And now the soul fares forth out of this same prototype wherein she
   discovers her nature according to the uncreatedness of the image and
   this she does in the divine death. The soul is conscious that what she
   seeks is neither her exemplar nor its nature, wherein she perceives
   herself to be in multiplicity and separation. For this final attribute
   of divinity is multiplicity. And since the eternal nature wherein the
   soul now finds herself in her exemplar is characterised by multiplicity
   -- the Persons being in separation -- therefore the soul breaks through
   her eternal exemplar to get to where God is a kingdom in unity. One
   philosopher declares that the soul's breaking-through is more noble
   than her emanation. Now Christ says : No man cometh to the Father but
   through me.' Christ is the eternal exemplar. Though the soul's abiding-
   place is not in him yet she must, as he says, go through him. This
   breaking-through is the second death of the soul and is far more
   momentous than the first. Of it St John says : Blessed are the dead
   that die in the Lord,' that is, in God.

   O surpassing wonder ! How can there be death in him who says of himself
   that he is the life ? To which we answer : In the birth of the Son all
   creatures went forth receiving life and being, hence all things are
   lively imaged in the Son. Now when the soul returns again within she
   loses the Son. Theologists declare that when the Son returns to unity
   of nature he is neither Person nor its property : the Son is lost in
   the unity of the essence. Likewise I say concerning the soul : when the
   soul breaks through and loses herself in her eternal prototype that is
   the death the soul dies in God. St Dionysius says ; When God exists not
   for the soul there exists not for her either the eternal prototype, her
   source.' Equality belongs to the soul in her exemplar, for the Son is
   equal

   276

   MEISTER ECKHART

   with the Father. But in that they are one in nature they are not equal,
   for equality resides in separation. Accordingly I say con- cerning the
   soul : if she is to enter the divine unity she must lose the equality
   she has in her eternal exemplar. Dionysius declares that the soul's
   supreme delight is the nothingness of her prototype. And a heathen
   philosopher says : God's naught fills everywhere and his aught is
   nowhere.' God's aught, then, is not discovered by the soul till she has
   come to naught as regards finding or being able to find herself,
   created or uncreated as we have shown her eternal prototype to be.

   This is the second death and second exodus, the soul going forth out of
   the nature which is hers in her eternal prototype to seek the kingdom
   of God. He who desires to come to God,' says one philosopher, let him
   come with naught.'

   The third nature out of which the soul goes is the exuberant divine
   nature energising in the Father. According to some theologists the
   Father always perceived within himself tokens of emanation before he
   brought forth the Word. They all agree that God the Father conceived
   his own nature in originating the eternal Word and all creatures.
   Doctors distinguish between nature and essence. Essence, in as far as
   it is active in the Father, is nature. The distinction is therefore a
   logical one. From God in activity all creatures look forth potentially.
   But this is not the summit of divine union so it is not the soul's
   abiding place.

   It must be clearly understood that the soul has got to die to all the
   activity connoted by the divine nature if she is to enter the divine
   essence where God is altogether idle ; this highest prototype of soul
   beholds without means the essence of the Godhead abso- lutely free from
   activity. This supernal image is the paradigm whereto the soul is
   brought by her dying.

   Now mark ! The Godhead, self-poised, is self-sufiicient. God as Godhead
   transcends all that creature as creature ever compre- hended or can
   ever comprehend. As St Paul says : God dwells in light inaccessible.'
   Now when the soul has gone out of her created nature and out of her
   uncreated nature wherein she dis- covers herself in her eternal
   prototype and, entering into the divine nature, still fails to grasp
   the kingdom of God, then, recognising that thereinto no creature can
   ever get, she forfeits her very self and going her own way seeks God no
   more ; thus she dies her highest death. In this death the soul loses
   every desire and image and all understanding and form and is bereft of
   any nature. And as God lives it is true that the soul, being
   spiritually dead, can no more manifest to any man any mode or image
   than the dead can stir being bodily dead. This spirit is dead and
   buried in the Godhead and the Godhead lives for none other than itself.

   Ah, noble soul, prove thy nobility ! But while it is the case with thee
   that thou lettest not go thine own self altogether to drown in the
   bottomless sea of the Godhead, verily thou canst not know this divine
   death. The wise man says : The Lord possessed me in the beginning in
   his own way.' God possesses all things in his Godhead's way, not in the
   soul's way, for God never received creature nor can creature ever get
   to him, as creature.

   Now when the soul has lost herself in every way, as here set forth, she
   finds herself to be the very thing she vainly sought. Herself the soul
   finds in the supernal image wherein God really is in all his Godhead,
   where he is the kingdom in himself. There the soul recognises her own
   beauty. Thence she must go out to get into her very self and realise
   that she and God are one felicity ; the kingdom which, without seeking,
   she has found. As saith the prophet : I poured out my soul into
   myself.' That is the meaning of : Knowest thou not thyself thou fairest
   among women ? Then go forth,' The soul has to go forth, as we have
   seen, in order to enter into herself, where she finds, without seeking,
   the kingdom of God. St Paul says : I reckon as worth- less temporal
   suffering in comparison with the future glory which shall be revealed
   to us.'

   Look you. I said of old, and say again, that I have now all that I
   shall possess eternally, for God in his felicity and in the fullness of
   his Godhead is enjoyed by my supernal prototype though this is hidden
   from the soul. As the prophet says : Indeed Lord, thou art a hidden God
   ! ' This treasure of God's kingdom is hidden by time and multiplicity
   by the soul's own activity and by her creaturehood. The more the soul
   departs from all this multiplicity the more God's kingdom is revealed
   in her. But the soul is not able for this without the help of grace. An
   she find it,, it is grace that has aided her thereto, for grace is
   innate in her highest prototype. There the soul is God, using and
   enjoying all things God-fashion. There the soul no more receives either
   from God or creatures, for she is what she contains and takes all
   things from her own. Soul and Godhead are one : there the soul finds
   that she is the kingdom of God.

   It may be asked what discipline best enables the soul to reach this end
   ? I answer : This, that the soul remain in death, not shrinking from
   death. St Paul says : Christ was obedient to the Father even unto the
   death of the cross. Therefore he hath exalted him and hath given him a
   name above every name.' And I say about the soul : if she remain
   obedient to God in death he will exalt her likewise and will give her a
   new name above every name. For as the Godhead is apart from name and
   nameless

   278

   MEISTER ECKHART

   so also the soul, like God, is nameless, for she is the very same as he
   is. Christ said : Henceforth I call you not servants but friends, for
   all that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.' A
   friend,' says a heathen, is a second self.' God became my seeond self
   that I might become his second self. And St Augustine declares : God
   became man that man might become God.' In God the soul receives a new
   life. In him she arises out of death into the life of the Godhead ;
   here God pours into her his divine fullness, here she receives a new
   name which is above every name. For as St John says, we have passed
   from death unto life because wc love.'

   Such is the interpretation of Christ's words : Seek first the kingdom
   of God and his righteousness.'

   Now let us sec how all things shall be added unto us.' We can take this
   in two ways : first, as meaning that whatever of perfection there is in
   tilings wc shall lind in that first kingdom. Secondly, that we must
   hold fast to perrection in all we do : a man's works should be wrought
   according to the law of God's kingdom. If any man acts in such a way
   that his deeds are able to demean him, be sure he is not acting
   according to the law of God's kingdom. When works are wrought according
   to humanity weeds and discord soon fall among them, but he whose work
   is wrought in the kingdom of heaven remains tranquil in every
   undertaking. And God saw all that he had made and behold it was very
   good,' say the scriptures. And I say concerning the soul, that all her
   acts are perfect as seen in the kingdom of heaven, for there all works
   are equal, my least is my greatest, and my greatest least. Humanly
   speaking they are imperfect, for works in themselves are manifold and
   lead to multiplicity, wherefore in respect of such one is nigh on the
   brink of discord. Hence Christ's words : Martha, Martha, thou troublest
   thyself about many things ; one thing is needful.'

   Of this be sure : to win perfection our activity must be of a nature so
   exalted that all our works arc wrought as one act ; and this must take
   place in the kingdom of heaven where man is God. There all things make
   divine response, there man is lord of all his works. Verily I say unto
   you : works wrought out of the kingdom of God arc dead works but works
   wrought in the kingdom of God are living works. The prophet says : God
   as little loves his works as he is disturbed and changed by them.' And
   so with the soul when she works in accordance with the law of God's
   kingdom. People of this sort are always the same whether they work or
   whether they work not, for works give nothing to them and take nothing
   from them.

   That is the meaning of : ^ All things shall be added unto you.'

   THE NOBILITY OF THE SOUL

   Whosoever would attain to the summit of his noble nature and to the
   vision of the sovran good, which is God himself, must have profoundest
   knowledge of himself and of things above himself. Thus he reaches the
   supreme. Beloved, learn to know thyself, it shall profit thee more than
   any craft of creatures. How to know thyself, of this now learn two
   ways.

   First, see that thy outward senses are properly controlled. Reflect, as
   regards these outward senses, that to the eye evil presents itself no
   less than good. The ear is importuned by one as well as the other and
   so with the other senses. Wherefore it behoves thee strictly to confine
   thyself and with all diligence to those things which are good. So much
   for the outward senses.

   Now turn to the inward senses or noble powers of the soul, lower and
   higher. Take the lower powers first. These are intermediate between the
   higher powers and the outward senses. They are excited by the outward
   senses : what the eye sees, what the ear hears, they offer forthwith to
   desire. This offers it again, in the ordinary course, to the second
   power, called judgment, which considers it and once more passes it on
   to the thiffl power, reckoning or reason. In this way it is clarified
   before it arrives at the higher faculties. So exalted is the power of
   the soul that she can seize it minus form or image and carry it in this
   state up into her higher powers. Here it is stored in the memory,
   mastered in the intellect and consummated in the will. These are the
   superior powers of the soul and they are one in nature. What the soul
   does is done by this simple nature in her powers.

   Now it may be asked, What is this nature of the soul ? -- It is the
   consciousness (the spark or synteresis) in the soul, that is the impar-
   tible nature of the soul. So subtile is this nature of the soul that
   space might not exist at all for all it troubles her. For instance, if
   one has a friend a thousand leagues away, thither flows the soul with
   the best part of her powers, loving her friend there. St Augustine
   testifies to this. He says, * The soul is where she loves rather than
   where she is giving life.' The simple nature of the soul is in no way
   hampered by place. So much for the nature of the soul.

   Next consider her higher powers, so orderly appointed, so ^ See also
   Greith, p. 114, etc. ; and Spamer, Texte, B. 2.

   admirably adapted to their several functions albeit of one nature.
   Memory is the power of storing up what the other powers bring in, that
   is its function. -- The second power is understanding. This is so
   exalted that in its understanding of the highest good, God namely, all
   the other powers must subserve it to the best of their ability. -- The
   third faculty is will. It is lordly enough to bid what it will and
   forbid what it will not ; from things it does not will it is altogether
   free. So much for the superior powers of the soul and the role assigned
   to each.

   Doctors dispute as to whether understanding is the nobler or the will.
   The position is this. Understanding secs things beyond this mundane
   level, that is its prerogative. But to will alone are all things
   possible. As St Paul declares, I can do all things in God who
   strengtheneth me.' When understanding comes to the end of its tether,
   up soars the will transcendent in the light and power of faith. Here
   will surpasses understanding. This is the prerogative of will. But mind
   you, though the will is free to do and leave undone exactly as it will,
   this upward flight is not achieved by its own power alone : help comes
   from the other powers and from faith as well. What help we shall now
   see. The powers have in common their impartible nature, and to this is
   due the transcension of the will. The other powers are the cause of
   this transcension in virtue of identity of nature. That is one help.

   Then comes the qucsticrti, which is the power in the psychic trinity
   wherein faith first appears ? -- The middle one : it springs from
   uriSerstanding but it is fortified in will and will is fortified by
   faith. Thus the light of faith contributes to this ascent of will. That
   is the second help. And of still another it remains to tell. Intellect
   projects itself to hear and understand. It analyses, orders,
   synthesises. But even when working to per- fection, always there is
   something on beyond which it cannot penetrate and which it recognises
   as belonging to a higher order. This it communicates to will, in their
   common nature, not in its individual capacity. This communication gives
   will an upward swing which displaces it into that higher order --
   always in their common nature. Here understanding is superior to will.
   But to will as individual a certain superiority belongs at the summit
   of its nature where it receives from the highest good, from very God.
   -- What does it receive ? -- It receives grace and in grace the highest
   good itself. What soul receives she receives willingly or not at all.
   Not that will as such receives this light : to receive is not its part
   ; but by the grace of the sovran good the other powers are strengthened
   in their common nature. This light is kindled in that second power, in
   the Holy Ghost. It is in this

   light that all works are wrought in the soul. As Isaias says, * All our
   works are wrought by* God.' This light is gracious light, and any light
   outside this light is the light of nature. It is a sure sign of this
   light when of his own free will a person turns from mortal things to
   the highest good, God namely. We are in duty bound to love him for
   conferring on the soul such great perfection. When she has reached her
   limit of endeavour then will as such is free to leap over to that
   gnosis which is God himself. A somersault which lands the soul at the
   summit of her power. A marvel, truly, God has made from naught in the
   image of himself !

   See now how the soul rises to sovran rank and to the zenith of her
   power. One master says, God is conveyed into the soul and there
   implanted. Whence there arises in the soul a divine love-spring which
   bears the soul back into God. Mark how. According to one holy man,
   Whatever we can say of God, that God is not.' According to another,
   Whatever we can say of God, God is.' And an eminent authority declares
   that both are right. With these three holy men even so I say, that when
   with her own understanding the soul receives divine understanding it is
   offered forthwith to her will. Will accepting it grows one with what it
   has accepted and finally takes it and puts it away in the memory. Thus
   God is conveyed and implanted in the soul. Then as to the divine
   love-spring. This overflowing in the soul causes her higher powers to
   flood the lower ones and the lower ones flood the outward man who,
   borne above all nether things, is incapable save of what is spiritual.
   As the spirit works Tjy divine energy even so the outward man is driven
   by the spirit.

   Oh wonder of wonders ! When I think of the union of the soul with God !
   lie makes the soul to flow out of herself in joyful ecstasy, for no
   named things content her. And since she is herself a nature named
   therefore she fails to content herself. The divine love-spring surges
   over the soul sweeping her out of herself into the unnamed being in her
   original source, for that is all God is. Creatures have given him
   names, but in himself he is nameless essence. Thus the soul arrives at
   the height of her perfection.

   Further as concerns the noble nature of the soul. St Augustine says ,
   As with God so with the soul.' Had God not made the soul in the
   likeness of himself, to be God by grace, she could never be God above
   grace. Her likeness to the pattern of the blessed Trinity we see by
   comparing her with God.

   God is threefold in Person and onefold in his nature. God is in all
   places and in each place whole. In other words, all places are the
   place of God. And the same with her. God has prevision

   of all things and everything is pictured in his providence. This is
   natural to God. And also to the soul. She too is threefold in her
   powers and simple in her nature. She too exists in all her members and
   in each member whole. So that all her members are the place of the
   soul. She too has foresight and imagines such things as she is able. To
   anything that we can predicate of God, soul has a certain likeness. Or,
   in the words of St Augustine, Like God like the soul.' God has endowed
   the soul with his own likeness which did she not possess she could not
   be God by grace nor above grace either ; whereas in this likeness she
   is able to attain to being God by grace and also above grace. And she
   must equal him in divine love and divine activity. So much for the soul
   as being God by grace.

   The soul who abides in this perfect likeness and in this noble nature
   God has given her, and at the same time rises to higher rank and
   higher, to her, what time she leaves the body, and at that very point,
   eternal life is open and in the opening she is encompassed with divine
   light, and enveloped in this divine light she is absorbed and
   transformed into God. Now each of the powers of the soul is endowed
   with the likeness of a divine Person : will receives the likeness of
   the Holy Ghost ; understanding receives the likeness of the Son ;
   memory the likeness of the Father and (her nature the likeness of the)
   divine nature withal remaining undivided. -- That is as far as I can
   understand it.

   In the third place let us see how the soul becomes God above grace.
   What God has given her is changeless for she has reached a heighrwhere
   she has no further need of grace. In this exalted state she has lost
   her proper self and is flowing full-flood into the unity of the divine
   nature. But what, you may ask, is the fate of this lost soul : does she
   find herself or not ? My answer is, it seems to me that she docs find
   herself and that at the point where every intelligence sees itself with
   itself. For though she sink all sinking in the oneness of divinity she
   never touches bottom. Wherefore God has left her one little point from
   which to get back to herself and find herself and know herself as
   creature. For it is of the very essence of the soul that she is
   powerless to plumb the depths of her creator. Henceforth I shall not
   speak about the soul, for she has lost her name yonder in the oneness
   of divine essence. There she is no more called soul : she is called
   infinite being.

   Now I go on to speak about abstract knowledge of God. And I address
   myself to you, my brethren and my sisters, beloved Friends of God who
   are familiar with him and know something of the matter. I will start
   with the nomenclature of the holy Trinity. And here you will be called
   upon to follow an abstruse,

   technical discussion. When we speak of the Father or the Son or the
   Holy Ghost we are speaking of the Persons. When we speak of the Godhead
   we arc speaking of their nature. The three Persons, as Person and
   essence, flow with their essence into the essence wherein they are
   Godhead. Not that the Godhead is other than what they are themselves :
   they are the Godhead in their unity of nature. They flow in essence
   into the essence, both Person and essence, because essence is
   comprehended by nothing but itself. It is fast locked in stillness,
   comprehending itself with itself. This influx is, in the Godhead, the
   oneness of the three inseparate Persons. In this same Ilux the Father
   flows into the Son and the Son again into the Father (as our Lord
   .Tesus Christ declares, He that sceth me secth my Father. My Father is
   in me and I in him '), and they both flow into the Holy Ghost and the
   Holy Ghost back to them again. (As our Lord Jesus Christ says, I and my
   Father arc one Spirit.') The Father utters his Son and in liis Son
   tells forth himself to creatures as a whole, all in this flow. And the
   Father returning to himself speaks himself to himself : The fountain
   flows into itself,' as St Dionysius says. This proceeding in the
   Godhead is a speaking without words and without sound; a hearing
   without ears; a seeing without eyes. In this proceeding each Person
   wordlessly utters himself in the others. It is a flow where nothing
   flows. Compare with this the noble soul, which provides a striking
   likeness of this flow ; for where her higher powers and her simple
   nature have the same property (hyparxis) they are flowing into each
   other, speaking themselves without word and without sound. Happy ftle
   soul who thus attains to the vision of eternal light !

   But it may be questioned, what about their power ? Is their power that
   of Person or of essence ? -- I answer that, the three are one God, no
   one is before or after the other : all three Persons are one first in
   the unity of their essential nature. Hence we speak of the activity of
   the blessed Trinity not of their essence. This is silence. Now speech,
   remember, beats into silence. In this sense the Persons are the
   hypostasis of essence. -- ^But why call it a beat ? -- Because it is
   neither a coming nor a going. In this impulse the Trinity has equal
   power to act and has wrought its work entirely unmoved and undisturbed.

   Examine, again, the statement, the Persons are the hypostasis.' This
   reveals two things. From the word are we gather that each Person is
   distinct in the Personality. But saying the hypostasis ' argues the
   three Persons and one nature to possess one property. The Persons are
   the hypostasis of the essence since their unity and personality have
   like power to act. This power the holy Trinity possesses in the unity
   of its natural essence. There you

   have the argument in full for the blessed Trinity having power in the
   unity of its divine nature.

   Two things we attribute to God, essence and nature. -- I should much
   like to know the difference.' -- Essence attracts and nature is common
   to the Persons : they are one. -- For God's sake, Sir, explain.' --
   Then follow with enlightenment, with mind attuned to the highest pitch.
   You see, God, whatever he is, has essence and essence is absolute
   stillness ; it is immoveable. It speaks not, loves not, gets not ; but
   it moves moveable things like creatures. Immoveability and motion do
   not represent (the divine nature) and the divine Persons : Persons and
   nature have one property. (Immoveability) distinguishes the essence.
   But what the divine nature is, of that no single drop did ever fall
   within the ken of any creature. According to one philosopher, God's
   nature is God's beauty.' And to this I add that in this same beauty
   there is play of light and its reflection, each Person radiant to the
   rest as to itself. This illumination is the perfection of beauty. --
   Good. I am quite satisfied with that. But now I want to ask about the
   eternal Word of the Father : is it to be taken as abiding within in his
   essence ? ' -- No. -- Is it to be taken in his Person ? ' -- No. --
   Then is it to be taken as being in the abstract nature of the Father ?
   '-- St Augustine, speaking as it were in the person of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, gives for it five analogies : I am come as a word from the
   heart that is spoken therefrom ; I am come as the light from the sun ;
   I am come as the heat from the fire ; I am come like the fragrance of a
   flower ; I am come like the streanT'from its perennial spring.' Even so
   is the eternal Word uttered in the Person of the Son while remaining
   God by nature in his nature. That is the answer.

   -- Now another question. Theologians say God is in every- thing. Is God
   in everything in his nature ? ' -- No. -- Is God in everything in
   Person ? ' -- No. -- Then how is he in everything ? ' -- As preserving
   their unity of nature. Persons and nature have but one property and
   this property is the divine essence as a whole. As such God is in all
   places and in each place God is all at once. For since God is
   impartible, all things and all places are the place of God. So
   everything is full of God, of his divine essence, continually.

   Three things are to be noted about the divine essence. First and
   foremost, it is the principle preserving all things ; in his divine
   essence God is in all things upholding them. But he is in the soul
   innately. Witness our Lord Jesus Christ : he was God and man. He has
   given us his sacred body : whoso receives it worthily receives at once
   the Person of the Son and divine nature ; he receives human nature
   joined with divine nature. For he is

   [Picture 313]

   Image of page 0309 #seq_0309 w {

   TRACTATES 285

   really present where he is worthily received. This accounts for God's
   loving himself in the soul.

   It may be asked, how does God love himself ? -- God is in all things,
   for he is with himself. God is with himself for love of himself. Hence
   God loves himself with himself in all things. -- Secondly, God is one
   alone ; hence it is from itself not from another. Were it from another
   it would reveal the thing from whence it came. Not so : it is by itself
   in stillness so profound it cannot of itself reveal anything at all.
   And here it may be noted that although God is potent for good yet it
   may be main- tained that his greatest power is his impotence. The
   argument runs thus. The impartible essence of divine nature is unity.
   Now unity cannot reveal itself to itself. That is its impotence and
   this impotence is the unity itself : the unity which is God's chief
   potentiality. Whence also the deduction that the three Persons have
   like power in their natural essence. And since this cannot manifest
   itself therefore the three Persons have manifested it and to none more
   than to themselves, for it is their own essential nature. -- ^Thirdly,
   it unifies and embraces all things in itself and in this embrace the
   Father loses his name although he preserves his paternity of Person.
   That is one Person. And the same with the other Persons. In this
   embrace all is dissolved in all for all encloses all. But in itself it
   is self-disclosed.

   Here arises the question how the first embraces all ? The answer is
   this. Things flowed forth finite into time while abiding infinite in
   eternity. There they arc God in God. Take an illus- tration. Suppose
   some master of the arts. If he pfb&uce a work of art he none the less
   preserves his arts within himself : the arts arc the artist in the
   artist. Even so tJie first contains the idea of all things, which is
   God in God.

   Then there is the question of how all things return into their first
   source ? The answer is this. Creatures all change their names in human
   nature and become ennobled ; in human nature they lose their own
   particular nature and find their way back into their cause. There are
   two ways of doing this. First, it is feasible for human nature to scale
   the heights by ghostly toil, for in spiritual travail the soul ascends
   to whence it came. That is one way. But there is another. The meat and
   drink a man consumes turns into flesh and blood. Now it is the
   Christian \ faith that this actual body will rise at the last day. Then
   things shall all arise, not as themselves but in him who has changed
   them into himself. He, spiritualised and turned to spirit, shall flow
   in spirit back to his first cause. From this it may be argued that
   every single creature has, in human nature, a stake in the eternal.
   Furthermore it argues the faithfulness and kindness and perfect

   MEISTER ECKHART

   love of God who refuses to shut out any belonging of his faithful
   servant : he takes him all together to himself. All embraces all, for
   all is one and one is all in all.

   Then there is the question how the Person of the Son was sent into
   Mary's virgin body and took on human nature without his ever quitting
   the shelter of his Father's bosom ? The answer is as follows : The
   bosom of the Father is the throne of God. The Father has given birth to
   his Son, is now giving him birth and shall go on giving him birth
   without stopping. This birth has been taking place in him for ever. At
   the very instant when the Son was donning human nature the Father was
   bringing him to birth. That is one explanation. Or take it in another
   way : the Son is the understanding of the Father and the architect^ of
   all things in his Father. Had this architect not wrought in his Father
   without ceasing the Father had not wrought at that particular point. So
   God's Son while taking on man's nature in Mary's body was the architect
   of all things in his Father. That is another explanation. Or take it,
   thirdly, in yet another sense. The Son has no less of the essence than
   the Father or the Holy Ghost, with whom he possesses it in common. And
   in the com- munity of their essential nature the Son himself is the
   encloser. Unity is the close, the Persons what the one encloses. Each
   Person in the utterance keeps his individual nature. But within this
   close the three Persons have one nature. The Son has his nature in
   common with the Father and with the Holy Ghost so that as therein
   contained he has with them one common property. It follo^^ that the Son
   has never for one instant left the Father. And herewith I conclude this
   threefold argument. It demon- strates conclusively that God has never
   waxed or waned in divine glory. -- So much of theology and of the noble
   lineage of the soul.

   Now we will speak about the union of the soul with God. There are those
   who say, nothing unites the soul so much as knowledge. Others again
   aver the same of love. And yet a third school teaches that nothing
   unites like use {Le, actual enjoyment). Now I put one question
   regarding these three things. What is the property of each ? Each is
   its own peculiar property. But at the summit of its property (its
   nature) each of them approaches so closely to the rest that they are
   virtually the same : threefold yet one in nature. This, to be sure, is
   not strictly true, but in the higher reaches of their nature, where
   they are verging on each other, knowledge enhances love and love
   enjoyment. Each one, however, does its own appropriate work. Knowledge
   raises the soul to the rank of God ; love unites the soul with God ;
   use perfects the soul to God. These three transport the soul right out
   of time into eternity. There the spirit in perfect freedom

   enjoys in its origin the height of bliss. Love and the sweetness of its
   uses have lured forth the soul to its naked spark. What is her fortune
   there ? All I can say is this ; the glance, out of the spirit, which
   pierces without stop into naked Godhead ; the flow, out of the Godhead,
   into the naked spirit, these are but one form which conforms and unites
   the spirit to God in form and oneness so that it receives as like from
   like. How spirit fares in this exalted state I know not, nor can I tell
   at all more than to say that the spirit is then at the summit of its
   power and its welfare is supreme.

   Peradventure you will say, It is all very well to talk, my friend, but
   how do I arrive at this exalted state you have described ? ' -- See.
   God is what he is and what he is is mine and what is mine I love and
   what I love loves me and absorbs me and what absorbs me that I am
   rather than my own self. By loving God therefore ye may become God with
   God. But I will not pursue this subject further.

   Now I want to say a little about the virtuous life so that you may have
   some guide to its attainment. Whosoever would attain to God must make
   him some return for all his godly works. He who would atone to God must
   needs possess one virtue : righteous- ness (or justice). This is the
   epitome of all the virtues. He must be bare and free within and
   without. What is the freedom of a godly man ? Being absolutely nothing
   to and wanting abso- lutely nothing for himself but only the glory of
   God in all his works. Mark two degrees of freedom in the willing poor.
   First they abandon friends and worldly goods and honours and^ descend
   into the valley of humility. There the willing poor find outward
   freedom and dwell unsolaced by perishable things. Follow the scorn and
   bitterness of the world. Courage, my children, establish yourselves in
   the valley into which ye have gone down. If the sons of the world
   revile you waver not ; stand fast in Christ remembering and acting on
   his words, The servant is not greater than his lord ; if the world hate
   you, know, it hated me before it hated you ! ' Accept it all from God
   with hearty thanks and deem yourselves all unworthy of it ; then, only
   then, have ye renounced yourselves.

   Then again there is ghostly freedom. He is in this^ sense free who
   finds within himself no sort of sin or imperfection. More free is he
   who cleaves to nothing that has name nor it to him. Still freer is the
   man who works not for reward from God but solely for God's glory. And
   most free of all, one who forgets himself and flows with all he is into
   the bottomless abyss of his first cause. This is the case of those
   willing poor who have descended into Humble Valley. They verily obey
   the precept of

   MEISTER ECKHART

   our Lord, If any man will come after me let him take up his cross and
   follow me/ From such as have denied themselves to follow after God in
   genuine poverty how can God refrain ? he must pour out his grace into
   those souls who thus in love have undone themselves. He pours his grace
   into them filling them full and in his favours he bestows himself. With
   his own self does God adorn the soul like gold adorned with a precious
   stone. There- after he leads on the soul to the beholding of his
   Godhead. In eternity this happens, not in time. Although in time she
   has a fore- taste of it in what is here described of the virtuous life.
   This I have told so ye may know that none achieves the crown and sum-
   mit of his nature, knowing and loving, excepting by the path of willing
   poverty, of being like these poor. That is for all the best.

   Now praising God for his eternal goodness we pray him to receive us at
   the last. So help us Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

   THE RANK AND NATURE OF THE SOUL

   When God created the soul he fell back upon himself and made her after
   his own likeness. Meister Eckhart of Paris says, God made nothing like
   himself besides the soul. Thus we can give no shape to God nor can we
   to the soul, and as God is immortal so did he make the soul. The soul
   is not dependent upon temporal things but in the exaltation of her mind
   is in communication with the things of God, hence her prodigious
   capabilities, and it amazes me that, being so like God and of such
   perfection and with such a powerful word of her own, the soul is still
   unable to speak the same as God. Some say it is because what is innate
   in God is not so in the soul : God is his own being and gets this from
   himself, but what the soul is that she gets from God and when she
   issues forth from him she does not keep his nature : she takes another
   nature, a descendent of divinity. So she does not behave the same as
   God : God moves all things in heaven and earth and gives life to all,
   and the soul moves the body, giving life to every limb so that it sees,
   hears, feels and walks and talks although the mind may be else- where.
   St Gregory observes, We cannot see the visible except with the
   invisible ' : the eye sees nothing corporal, lacking the a-corporal
   thing which quickens it to sight. Subtract the mind, Le, the soul which
   is invisible, and the eye is open to no purpose, which before did see.
   God has formed the soul to himself and with himself and in himself ; of
   time and in time and timely, and no soul can get into God without first
   being God as she was before she was made into God. Nothing but God
   finds its way into

   God, and once the soul is in God she is God, borne into God on his
   eternal Word. Soul is the mean 'twixt God and creature ; she is placed
   at the beginning and end of the supreme, in touch with common knowledge
   and with the consolation the angels bring to her from God. If she
   prefers the inferior powers of her live senses to her higher ones
   whence comes her knowledge of celestial things, then she grows ignoble
   and base. The creature pleasures of the soul God has no stomach for,
   and when she realizes this she discards the joys in which God has no
   share.

   While the soul is still here, in sleep, she drives away the angels, and
   refusing any longer to serve creature she conceives herself all one
   with God. St Augustine says the soul is nobler, mightier, grander than
   any creature, but the angels are by nature of still higher rank, for
   they are the first issue of the breath of God which gives life to them.
   Gregory, again, observes that The soul God has appeared to, who has
   some inkling of him, hnds creatures all so narrow and so vain.' --
   While the higher powers of the soul are holding fast to God she
   actuates her lower powers so that what occurs in these comes to the
   knowledge of the higher ones. The highest power of the soul is called
   an inextinguishable light because of the vision the soul has in this
   power. However far away her power is from God she can discern God
   always. Her power is never so much out but that it still burns
   somewhat, enough to be a danger-signal to the soul and, even were she
   spiritually dead in sin, a beacon showing her the way to come alive
   again and arise in true sorrow and repentance.

   Here comes the question. Can the soul with her owff powers comprehend
   her highest happiness ? The answer given to this question by the four
   doctors, Thomas, Egidius, Henricus and Albertus is, that if the soul
   had her knowledge of herself, as she has her being, image-free, then
   she would be able to take in her highest happiness, she being an
   infinite capacity which God cannot fill excepting with himself. St
   Augustine says. If her own perfect nature were immediately present to
   the soul she would be her proper self rather than creature in her
   nature, as she is classified. For God is spirit and he en-spirits the
   soul who, in her spiritual nature, belongs to an order above creatures;
   she finishes with creature in the perfect image of the eternal birth
   which is directly formed in her.

   Another question is. How does God enter the soul ? Is he innate in her,
   sustaining her with his intrinsic energy and pro- viding her with life
   and being ? One theory is that God enters the soul in three ways. First
   in his grace whereby a man being gratified is filled with the desire of
   perfecting virtue as a whole, mingled with alarm lest any creature ever
   filch it from him.

   Secondly, God enters the soul in pure perception wherein a man beholds
   himself and learns to know himself and answer any call God may make
   upon him, be it suffering or trials, bodily or mental. Thirdly, God
   enters the soul in true freedom, liberating man from all the cares of
   life. Let the soul bid him welcome, refusing to be satisfied save with
   him alone. At the highest point of his inner self, his soul, man is
   more God than creature : however much he is the same as creature in his
   nature, in mind he is like God more than any creature. To the soul at
   rest in God in her potential, her essential, intellectual nature,
   everything comes natural as though she were created not at the will of
   something else but solely at her own. In this point creatures are her
   subjects, all submitting to her as though they were her handiwork. It
   was in this power the birds obeyed St Francis and listened to his
   preaching. And Daniel took refuge in this power, trusting himself to
   God alone, when he sat among the lions. Moreover, in this power it has
   been the custom of the saints to offer up their suffer- ings which, in
   the greatness of their love, arc to them no suffering.

   Dionysius says the soul has got to purify herself till in her perfect
   clarity she is like the angels and receives by grace what the angels
   have by nature. For the soul will not be able to fulfil her destiny
   till she is like the angels in whom is no sin. But the soul is from
   heaven (that is to say, from God who is the heaven of the soul) and
   body from the earth, s© they are ever opposed to one another. And that
   is why the soul, wanting to get back to God whence she issued forth,
   absconds and leaves behind her all the thfli^s which are not God and do
   not lead to God. All form and likeness, Dionysius says, God in the
   first instance imprinted in the lesser angels so that they should
   inform the soul with divine light and consolation and enable her to
   enter into her own solitude, God namely, wherein no creature can ever
   look and sec.

   Theologians say the soul is more greatly blest when God begets himself
   in her without corporal union than the body of Christ is without his
   Godhood and without his soul. But any beatific soul is a nobler thing
   than Christ's mortal body, for the interior birth of God within the
   soul is the final consummation of her happiness, a happiness more real
   to her than Christ's becoming man since this profits the soul nothing
   without union with God. As Dionysius says, Beatitude means an
   in-dwelling with God such that he is more present to the soul than she
   is to herself, and the soul can apprehend him best when she approaches
   him with a tranquil mind.' For in peace is his habitation and in peace
   he elected us his children. But as God is the mover in the starry and
   revolving heavens so here in the soul he is the mover of the freedom of
   our will towards himself and towards all good things :

   it is in his light that she sees the light and in his light she will be
   united with the light. Theologians say that in their own nature the
   angels in heaven are nobler than the soul of Christ or Mary because
   they are in essence nearer than the soul to God. But by merit Christ's
   soul has more joy than all the angels and is nearer God than any angel.
   And the same with Mary's soul. Not by nature though, for by nature
   Christ's soul, and Mary's too, is the same as mine or any other human
   soul. Further, theologians teach that the soul in man is more than
   thousandfold, for it is whole in every limb : in the fingers, in the
   eyes and in the heart and in every several portion of each member large
   and small. Just as in the eighth heaven, where there are so many stars,
   there is one angel who revolves that heaven and exists entire in each
   star. When God created man he safeguarded him against all ills ; the
   golden (ihain of destiny coming from the Trinity to the highest power
   of the soul and running also through her lower powers subordinates them
   to the higher so that no fell disorder can attack either the body or
   the soul excepting he transgress this law. In her higher powers the
   soul is spirit and in her lower, soul ; and betwixt soul and spirit is
   the bond of one common being.

   Also you must know that in the soul there exists one power which rests
   not day or night ; it is flowing from the Spirit and is altogether
   ghostly, and in this power God comes out in the full flower of his joy
   and glory, as he is in himself. Such intense delight, such supreme
   exaltation as no mind can conceive nor tongue express. Were he always
   recollected in this power a man would never age. Nay more I say :
   should he in this power catch but one fleeting glance of the joy and
   bliss therein, it would be happiness enough to make amends though he
   suffered all things.

   The soul receives four things from God in her power of under- standing.
   First, the entire certainty of freedom, of riddance, from all
   creatures, which God object^ to in her. Next, the full enjoyment of God
   while she abides in the power of love. Third, the. complete protection
   of God against all harm from creatures. Fourthly, victory in this power
   over all her foes. For as the Son of God, so also is the soul, and the
   promise of the Son is the promise of the soul, only she is not
   suspended from where the Son issues from the Father. Fire and heat are
   one ; taste and tasted are one, albeit far asunder. The Word God speaks
   eternally lies hidden in the soul so that one neither knows of it nor
   hears it. Dionysius says the soul resembles the procession in the
   Godhead since the higher powers of the soul have her nature common to
   them and each power flows into the rest. For the soul to rise

   to spirit she must betake herself to her eternal part, never failing to
   remember that, by the grace of Gk)d, hers is an imperishable nature and
   capable of eternal bliss. Her spirit is suspended from the unchanging
   God, so neither life nor death nor height nor depth nor angel nor man
   nor any creature can loose her steadfast hold on God : the soul who
   dies in God is also buried in him and beyond the ken of creatures just
   as much as God is beyond their ken. As Dionysius says, when the soul
   considers the greatness of God's might beside her littleness she casts
   herself out of herself and out of every creature and thus reduced to
   naked nothingness, God keeping her in his power, she persists simply in
   the grace of God. God is concerned solely with himself ; he is to each
   thing absolutely whole. And the soul should be the same : what God is
   by nature she must be by grace : detached and free from creatures,
   abandoning all things to God as though they were not. In a soul like
   this all that survives is God : his uncreated Breath is what the soul
   draws in inspiration, and she is spirit to all things and all things
   spirit to her, the eternal spiration of the Holy Ghost. Vicentius the
   philosopher observes, The spirit detached is of such perfection that
   what it sees is real, what it wills comes true and its commands must be
   obeyed.'

   It must be remembered that when the free spirit stands in perfect
   isolation it constrains God to itself, and if it could subsist as form
   devoid of accident it would have all the character of God. But this God
   grants to none beside himself ; the utmost God can do is to^gjyc
   himself to him, and such an one is so far raised up to eternity that
   nothing temporal can move him, nothing material affect him ; he is dead
   to the world, as St Paul says, I live not ; Christ Hveth in me.'

   According to Dionysius, death in God is nothing but the un- created
   life, that is, God himself, not now called the soul but the sovran
   power of God, because with it he performs his will. What the five
   senses get from such a soul she gives the whole of to her inner man
   whenever he embarks upon some high adventure, and such an one is then
   nonsensical (or senseless), his object being the rational, a-sensible
   idea. Dionysius comments on the dictum of St Paul, There be many that
   run for the crown but it falls to none but the wise.' This race, he
   says, is nothing else than the flight from creatures to union with
   their uncreated God. The soul, in hot pursuit of God, becomes absorbed
   in him, and she herself is reduced to naught, just as the sun will
   swallow up and put out the dawn. St Augustine says, The soul has a
   private door into divine nature, where for her all things amount to
   naught.' And, The flavour of the spirit spoils the taste for flesh ' ;
   and, The soul at her summit is ignorant with knowing, j5pj .tjb^
   .oneness of

   the spirit those that have abandoned everything to God are as he had
   them when we existed not.' The Lord Jesus stands before the soul as the
   perfect pattern for our human conduct. But the subjective aspect of the
   three Persons -- Godhead, mind -- no crea- ture ever saw, not soul nor
   angel nor the humanity of Christ, in its own nature. Yet it is held by
   some, and Meister E(rkhart of Paris notably, maintains in the teeth of
   all objections : As surely as you know me for a man so surely God gives
   birth to his own nature in the ground of my soul as in his heaven, and
   I am not happy till I return to God discarding every means of sin and
   all its brood together with all creatures. For in th(^ selfsame ground
   wherein the Father bears his Son in his own nature therein am I born.
   In the soul that has trodden underfoot all the ills of time the Father
   naturally will beget his Son as surely as my father gat me a living
   man. In the very ground wherein the Father gets his Son therein does he
   get me and all whom the Fatlier draws to him by grace. And as God in
   himself is absolutely free from things so I am there by gratae what God
   is by nature. God destines all of us to such a glorious lot as few
   indeed can credit who have not gone out of themselves. If God gave the
   soul his whole creation she would not be lillcd thereby but only with
   himself : he is the very highest uncreated heaven of all the heavens in
   God's nature. That the soul in us is deathless is not our doing but
   God's : it is the nature of her. But union comes by grace, the highest
   stooping down to inform the lowest, and therein lies our hope of future
   sight.

   The soul ascends from corporal things and, being caught up above
   herself, abides within herself, lirst, for the sake of the delights she
   finds in God. For the divine perfection invests her in him with his
   likeness. His fullness is i)oured forth without stint : angels more in
   number than the sands and grass and water- drops and every single angel
   with his own distinctive nature, not one the same as any other,-
   Secondly, the soul ascends for the sake of the purity she finds in God
   ; things in him arc all quite pure and noble, but once they issue forth
   from him into the nearest creatures there is all the difference between
   aught and naught. -- Thirdly, the soul ascends for the recollection she
   enjoys in God. In order to grasp God she must have a wont that is
   higher than herself ; though God had made a thousand earths and a
   thousand heavens the soul could comprehend them all in her one power,
   the active power's reflection. But she cannot conceive God in the act
   of making her in his own image. -- Fourthly, the soul ascends for the
   sake of the infinite good things she enjoys in God : all things in him
   are ever new in his Son who to-day is being born the same as though his
   Father had never given him

   birth. And as God is flowing into the soul she is flowing back into
   God.

   The soul takes four steps into God. On turning to God, at first she
   feels afraid of his magnificence. Her next step is to overcome this
   fear and conceive the hope of God's affection. Her third step brings
   the vehement desire, she hails it as the promise, of the infinite
   embrace wherein she is embraced by God. -- At the fourth step she falls
   into such deep oblivion she never thinks of leaving what she has found
   in God. God made the soul for his only Son to be born in her. And when
   and where soever there befalls this birth it gives God greater jdcasure
   than the creation of the heavens and earth because the soul is nobler
   and bigger than the heavens. As there is wedlock between a man and wife
   so there is wedlock between God and the soul. The head power in the
   soul is the man and the lowest is his wife. The man in the soul always
   stands Ijareheadcd and the woman veiled, the lower power being caught
   up to the highest of the soul. First God begets his likeness in the
   soul and afterwards himself as he is in eternity. God's Son is the
   soul's Son : in him God and the soul have the same Son, that is, God.
   Once this birth has happened in the soul she is fit for (iod, and the
   oftener this birth befalls the more at home the soul will be in God, in
   his paternal heart.

   The soul has two feet, understanding and love. And the more she knows
   the more she loves. Who shall catise her to fall, she bdng uphold by
   the sustaincr of all creatures ? Grace lending wings to desire^he is
   borne out of herself, and by grace and in grace she is borne into grace
   and past grace into (iod her first cause where in blissful union her
   lot is good beyond compare. There every sense is dumb; the soul's will
   and God's will are confused with one another, the two wills love-locked
   in the true atonement. Now the soul does neither more nor less than the
   work of God, for there no longer lives in her anything but God. As the
   soul cries in the Book of Love, I have nni the whole world round and
   have found no end to it. Wherefore I have east myself into the solitary
   point of my one God who has wounded me with his glance.' Whom this
   glance did never wound, his soul was never pierced with the love of
   God. St Bernard says, To the spirit that feels this glance it is
   ineffable ; to him that fe(;ls it not it is incredible.' 'Tis an arrow
   sped without anger and received without pain ; thence starts the pure
   and limpid stream of healing grace which opens the inner eye to
   perceive in blissful beholding the delights of this divine affliction
   wherein we enjoy unheard-of spiritual favours, things never told nor
   preached of nor yet described in any book.

   The soul must give up idle thoughts and worldly cares and corporal
   pleasures and find her way into his hiding-place whom the

   heaven of heavens is not able to contain. Gk&gt;d's comfort is only for
   that soul who scorns all temporal consolations ; and the more she runs
   from creatures the faster their creator comes and makes her one with
   him. Dionysius says, love takes the soul out of herself and identifies
   her with the object of her love, making her insensible and reckless of
   herself so long as she can do the will of her best-beloved. The powers
   of the soul, those of her spiritual mind, are celestial in the sense
   that they do celestial work ; thus the first power receives, the second
   one perceives and the third one loves. When the soul, conceiving God,
   is using in recollection her mnemonic power and, in beholding, her
   intelligence, then love transports her into the midst of God, the point
   at which there is eternal rest. The Father abiding in the soul clasps
   her to his heart, and in this fatherly embrace she conceives the Son in
   his personal procession and hence divines his presence with the Father
   in his essence ; as saith the Lord, 1 will lead her into the desert,'
   meaning, he will lead the soul away from vanity and say his say, his
   only Son, in her. And in this same begetting of his Son they pour their
   holy Breath into the soul, informing her of all things. Any act of soul
   that is to share in the eternal meed must be wrought in God. However
   good an act is in itself, excepting it be wrought in God, it meets with
   no reward from hini who docs not pay by length or size or multitude of
   works but for their being done in God, soul being the material God
   works in. In this divine alliance she is highly honoured, for what God
   is by nature she is made by grace. But if a soul presents herself
   before her bridegroom Jesus Christ without the ordinary virtues,
   forgetting to prepare herself in this resja.'ct for heaven, her shall
   he cast out into the pit of hell, there to realize his justice just as
   much in suffering as St Peter did in heaven liis eternal joy. Her true
   bridegroom Jesus Christ comes to the soul and shows her in his visible
   humanity his divine affection in order that all creatures may do homage
   to our nature which has been exalted higher than the angels. We cannot
   imagine him creating any creature nobler than ourselves. His manhood
   satis lies our sense as his Godhood does our soul. As St Augustine
   says, we shall end with our soul in the Godhead, and our bodily senses
   in the humanity of Christ which is exalted above the saints and angels
   to where, in its unchanging nature, no (creature can attain. When the
   watching soul is warned by various signs of the coming of her king,
   everything in her rejoices, and it is his royal right to use his sovran
   power to fulfil the expectation of the soul who longs for him to
   buttress her against her outward senses lest by yielding to them in the
   least she should bring about in any creature something counter to the
   will of God. The surest way to friendship with the king is for the soul
   blindly to

   follow where God leads. If the soul, which rather than the body
   constitutes us man, if the soul, I say, would only obey all God's
   intimations she would overcome every obstacle with ease and rejoice in
   the burdens borne for him. And when she finds herself with nothing to
   correct she will be free with perfect freedom from opinion. It is the
   mark of the God-loving soul that from the moment she goes into his
   service she never follows her own will as distinct from his. God is the
   one thing that needs nothing and that all things need. And when the
   soul, beholding herself from within, perceives herself by grace
   omnipotent she stays in her own ideal nature.

   The soul observes concerning God, first, that she has intuition of him
   who is to come to her. Next, she is in essential union with him who is
   operating in her. Thirdly, she enjoys him who so richly entertains her
   at his table. Fourthly, he provides her with a refuge where she is at
   peace. Dionysius says, When the soul returns to God her idea of herself
   in God is that, except for self- awareness, nothing survives in her but
   God.* When the soul does this she still keeps in touch with her outward
   man whom she supplies with his natural life. By speaking himself into
   the soul God unites himself with her and makes the soul into himself,
   giving her such great ability, it seems to her that being hen; in time
   is her only obstacle to good. In the virtuous uses of her exaniplar
   mind, all things being present to the soul in this interior Word of
   God, her spirit converses with God freely in proportion to the
   clearness of the Father's inspiration. It is important then for the
   soul to* Kliow what behaviour to adopt towards God so that she may
   discover the practices that draw from God his intimations. For this the
   loving soul must love God more than anything, who, descending into her
   and energising in her with his spirit, gives her to understand that the
   interior love she has from him she ought to have and show towards all
   mankind ; and the soul should submit herself to God as though he
   suffered death for her alone. So doing she will wax in truth and fit
   herself to receive the universal gift of God whereby she will arrive at
   the truth of the humanity of Christ. But if she does not do her best
   she puts herself on a material level with the brutes, that must be
   spurred to great exertion ; yet the sorriest of men, who are always
   bound to fall short of God, Christ wrought more deeds of love for than
   all the saints have ever done for love of him. Though all creatures
   were to speak they could never tell the perfection God confers on man,
   especially the soul, than which he neither could nor would make any
   nobler creature. 1'his he proves in his own Person, with its common
   boundary bi;twcen his divine and human natures. It follows that the
   soul ought to shun all creatures as things unworthy

   of her whereby she may be lured from the things she is destined to by
   God, and she ought to be ashamed if, being within reach of his eternal
   good, she should fail to grasp it.

   Here there is the question, If the soul is of such high estate that
   time and place and nature arc powerless to move or even touch her in
   her essential self, does God then work in her without any image of
   himself ? To this theologists reply, Granting the soul is creature and
   has a spiritual nature it follows of neeessity that what God does in
   her is wrought essentially and free from all contingency ; for his
   works arc all essential and eternal as they are in himself, and the
   soul participates them in her nature above grace. Grace is the
   outflowing light designed for the service of the spirit ; grace would
   not be a light had it no recognised spiritual mission. At the point
   where God enters the soul in love she is no more known than the highest
   angel is to her and loves all things God -fashion without any natural
   idiosyjH*rasy. God is abstract intellectual essence, eternal in itself,
   whereas the soul is made eternal. The soul is no more to be grasped in
   images and forms than God in words and names. The soul is one in nature
   with and subject to the laws of the authentic intellect of God, a monad
   so perfectly balanced in itself no creature can And room there.

   The Lord Jesus said to his disciples, 1 go to prepare a place for you.'
   These words teach us two important facts. First, that the soul is by
   nature made for heaven and God is her lawful heritage. For God brought
   forth the soul alone in unbroken line and no man knoweth what she is.
   Every man has got a soul, but what she actually is there is no telling
   here in time. St Augustine says, the soul is sent from God and returns
   to God and she cannot rest except in him ; for God is spirit and soul
   is also spirit and germane to God as one spirit to another. And they
   compare the soul with fire, most lofty in its nature, most mighty in
   its ojjcration, which never rests until it licks the skies. Fire
   envelops all the elements, spreading further and wider and higher than
   the air, than water or the earth, so that it surrounds the rest and
   coming next the heavens turns round with them. The soul is called a
   lire because in her desire she keeps up with God, like fire with the
   heavens and can find no rest except in him. Again, the soul is dubbed a
   spark of celestial nature because one has already ascended into heaven,
   the soul, to wit, of Jesus Christ, which shows the common resting-
   place of souls is nowhere else than heaven. But unless the soul has
   turned from temporal to celestial things the Holy Ghost cannot enter in
   to do its work in her. All God's work is wrought in spirit. God is high
   and man is low : to rise to him in prayer he has to hoist himself by
   putting under him God's creatures, all of them, including the powers of
   the soul which end in the functions

   of the body, then she will have the love and knowledge to carry her
   above the world. For to know God I want no eyes or ears ; for union
   with God in love I want no hands or feet ; I want to withdraw myself
   from all created things and let my spirit swoon into God's spirit and
   be one spirit with Gk)d ; withal it was the love God bears my soul that
   prevailed with him to create all creatures and therein reveal to her
   his glory. And albeit he made creatures glad, he mixed therewith some
   sorrow, that anyone careless of his honour might be whipped and spurred
   with pain. Marvellous as the mind of man are the ways of God, drawing
   one to him with pleasure and another with the buffets of ill-fortune ;
   witness the amazing conversion of St Paul on his way to persecute the
   Chris- tians, notwithstanding which his soul was caught up into the
   third heaven. And the very day St Augustine was converted he refused to
   be appeased with the extraordinary pleasure he felt in the security God
   sent into his soul to turn her to him.

   Three things keep the soul from being content with creatures. In the
   first place they are partial. In the second, they arc cor- poral :
   emblems of stagnation and corruption and unprogressive- ness. Thirdly,
   the gift of creatures is no largesse of him from whom she first came
   forth {Le, from God), so they are not relished by souls who have been
   caught up into bliss ; but God the Jiord lures souls to him just as the
   lambs are lured from one spot to another by green pasture. Though all
   psychic powers lay in a single soul she could not here receive the very
   least reward of the smallest act decreed by God in his eternal love
   without the soul melting and dying to the body. Not so, however, when
   she gets the whole reward, namely God himself. But for this the soul
   must transcend herself and creatures and enter into the divine estate,
   into her divine exemjdar nature ; for the soul contacts eternity with
   her higher powers and with her lower, creatures, whicli often lead her
   into evil. Could the soul see God as clearly as the angels do she would
   never have come into the body. God is formed in the image of himself,
   after a pattern of his own, and when she mingles with him in actual
   intuition, the soul resembles him in form, for he conforms her to him :
   divine light streams into the soul confusing her with God like one
   light with another and this is called the light of faith, the divine
   virtue. Where the soul with her powers and her passions is forbidden to
   go, there faith can take her ; and when in this power God is
   apprehended in the soul she acquires the virtue of hope wherein the
   soul becomes so intimate with God she fancies there is nothing in God
   beyond her reach. St Augustine says, The pears I stole, these were to
   me far sweeter than the ones my mother bought, because they were
   private and forbidden fruit.' And so is that grace sweeter to the

   soul which she conceives in wisdom than that which is common to
   mankind. The soul must serve God here with her lower powers and in
   eternity with her higher ones, for she is not made of time nor of
   eternity : she is made from naught of the nature of them both. Leaning
   to the temporal she is unstable ; keeping to the eternal she is strong
   and stable and superior to change.

   The bridegroom of the soul is the Lord Jesus of sevenfold like- ness.
   First, in his beauty with which the sun is nothing to compare, for it
   is not self-luminous : God provides the light wherewith it lights the
   air. And his bride should be the same in thought and word and deed. For
   this God lias to brighten all her tarnishes of sin, making luminous the
   place of her abode.- Secondly, her Lord is of noble lineage : in heaven
   he has a F ather but no mother and on earth a mother but no father,
   parentage too strange for any mind to grasp. And his bride, the soul,
   by birth adorns a rank higher than anything inferior to God. --
   Thirdly, her Lord is immensely rich : heaven and (arth belong to him
   with all the creatures in it. Accordingly his bride, the soul, may
   freely confide her every care to him and have no doubt of his
   providing, for lui is readier to give than we are to receive. --
   Fourthly, his wisdom is so lucid, it lights the ground of every heart
   and nothing is hidden from his eyes. Wherefore his bride, the soul,
   must be very cartTul not to do anything she thinks may be displeasing
   in his sight,- "F'ifthly, his power is prodigious ; by it all things
   have come to be and arv preserved in being. And his bride, the soul,
   has corresponding ho])(i in times of trouble or in any kind of suffer-
   ing or struggle. For what she cannot do he can to wllom all things arc
   possible.- Sixthly, he is sweet-tem[)ercd. He is called in the
   scriptures a lamb without blemish, for he is free from anger and bears
   no resentment. Likewise the soul, his bride, must be gentle, kind and
   patient in whatever he shall send her to his glory. -- Lastly, her
   Lord, Jesus Christ, has eternal health and dcatlilessncss. And the
   soul, his bride, should be cheerfully indifferent to disease, not
   caring for anything so much but she would always be as glad to do
   without as keep it, just as her bridegroom pleases, and finding no pain
   so hard to bear but she would suffer it as lief as not. God's justice
   to her is as precious as his mercy. This soul is just as pleased with
   God's gifts to others as herself.

   It is written, The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God ' who
   keeps them too tightly to his sides to be gotten out. Also he made them
   separate as his handiwork ; their guerdon in eternal life, himself ;
   for God alone did make the soul, unhelped by any crea- ture ; in power
   according to his might ; in intellect according to his wisdom and
   according to his goodness in her will, as he from

   eternity knew how to make her mighty in his power and blessed in his
   infinite good. The soul is not made of the nature of God but in the
   image of the Holy Trinity, and being bound to God by love alone she,
   seeking perfect rest in him, proclaims her fitness to be his pleasant
   temple. He went into his temple and drove out the buyers and the
   sellers, commanding them. Take these things hence. So he made it known
   that he would have the temple of the soul swept clean, with nothing in
   it but himself alone. The soul should take example by the angels who
   disregard all outward things and are without intention except to do the
   perfect will of God. So bent are they upon the will of God, upon its
   being done in them, that were it to pick nettles or anything like that,
   they would do it with a will, as though their whole happiness depended
   on it.

   Any soul devoted thus to the will of God and seeking not her own Jesus
   takes delight and will work wonders in. When she goes out of her own
   will all things go in with .Jesus and she becomes so full of light that
   God alone rivals her in splendour. For though the angels do to some
   extent resemble the soul in the joys of the hereafter, they have a
   limit set which they cannot pass beyond. The soul can transcend it in
   good works, and having once, in grace, drawn level here with the
   highest angel, her will, free now from all good works, carries her
   incalculably higher than the angels, provided she can leave her body.

   The uncreated God alone is free and the soul's virgin nature is the
   same but not her creature nature : it was she who chose to come to
   naught, but it is left to God to fetch her back. For Jesus to be in the
   soul she has to recollect herself and be quiet and listen to his Word.
   When her spirit is receiving power in the Son her every word is
   pregnant of purity and virtue and perfection. Such a soul nothing can
   disturb : she stands firm and unshaken as in the power of God.

   And Jesus reveals himself in the soul in his infinite wisdom wherein
   the Father knows himself in all his fatherly authority, to- gether with
   his Word which is wisdom's self and all that therein is and the oneness
   of it. When this same wisdom is embodied in the soul, doubt, error,
   obstacles of all sorts fade away and leave her in the clear, pure light
   which is God himself. God in this soul is seen with God : she knows
   herself and all things with his wisdom. -- Also Jesus manifests himself
   with passing sweetness in the power of the Holy Ghost, and with him the
   soul flows into herself and beyond herself and transcending all things
   in grace, plunges directly into her first cause.

   Richardus says, commenting upon the Book of Virtue ; When the divine
   light strikes into the soul she finds her own activities

   exceedingly insipid, and unable to tolerate herself in her own powers
   she confines herself to enjoying God. Now St Augustine says, My soul is
   where she loves rather than where she is giving life.* At this rate God
   is nearer me than I am to myself ; and any loving soul who follows God
   so far as to rise above herself, nor rests with pleasure in herself or
   any creature, such a soul, I say, will have no pleasure either in God's
   gifts : what she desires is God himself. When the soul is rid of things
   she has certain knowledge of and is nothing lacking in the image of
   God, her mind is wide open to the eternal truth. The eternal sun sheds
   its light into this soul and permeates her powers, each separate
   faculty feeling the physical contingency of the visitation according to
   its individual nature. And the light of the eternal sun raises all the
   soul-powers to the power of itself in the wholly intelligible image.
   When the soul undergoes this operation, as it is per- formed by God, in
   essential understanding, then the soul's under- standing becomes the
   light (or knowledge) of all God is bringing about in her by grace. And
   her mind being enhanced, as we have said, her faculties are raised
   above the things of time, so that come what may her powers arc
   unhindered by anything infernal and are always being augmented, never
   getting less. For divine understanding we depend upon God's bounty ;
   but it is his nature to give himself to us and the soul's nature is to
   give herself to him who gives himself to her, thus giver and gift, doer
   and deed are one. The Lord Jesus said, I go to him that sent me.* And
   the soul too may say in her ascent to God, I go to him I came from.*

   She goes to the Father, first, in her fixed intention no longer to
   disobey his will by cumbering herself with untoward creatures.
   Secondly, she goes the perfect way of answering every call God makes
   upon her ; and thirdly, she goes in the sweet savour of God's love
   wherein her suffering is no suffering. Fourthly, she goes in the four
   cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, fortitude and justice, over
   time and creatures. And she goes in the three virtues of faith, hope
   and charity, without which no one gets to God. Who knows to what
   wonders the soul may not attain by committing herself into the hands of
   God ? Every blessed soul keeps open heart to God's consolation, and
   such as she receives from him she passes on to her inferior powers
   wherewith she knows not God else were he dishonoured in the weak
   intelligence of these lower faculties. And because all souls have not
   the same aptitude for God, the vision of God is not enjoyed the same by
   all any more than the sunshine affects all eyes alike.

   It is written, There shall come forth a stem out of the root of Jesse.*
   Here let us consider three things : what this root is out of which God
   is born in the soul, and what and what measure

   of profit does it bring ? Root of Jesse ' is a term for the fiery

   nature whieh attracts and transmutes all comers to itself. It is the
   fiery nature of God : drawing the soul it converts her into itself and
   she is spiritually born in understanding ; for the soul has in common
   with the angels a light wherein she can see God, and this light she is
   provided with is her intellect which is cease- lessly conveying God's
   wisdom to the soul. But it darkens when poured into the body.

   We read of three kings bringing Christ their offerings. These we take
   to mean the three inferior powers of the soul, things by rights at the
   disposal of her superior powers. I am going now to speak of these
   superior powers, showing how they are the kings and what gifts of lower
   powers it is they bring.

   The first king is memory, bearing the produce of his kingdom. When the
   soul calls to mind how noble God has made her there flows from this
   perception a passionate desire which ascends to God, flinging behind it
   all the things of tiiiK*. Then indeed King Memory conies offering the
   gold of love to God, together with surrender of all else. The second
   king of the soul is understanding. This corresponds with her other
   power, reason or judgment. When the soul sees that by grace she is
   enabled to fulfil the will of God, she is never weary of subjugating
   creatures to please God and each one the more in proportion to the
   merit she acquires from God. Understanding then, comes rich with
   patience and grateful acceptance of whatever lot God destines for her
   in the body here and with this she has the fruit of incense, the union
   of all virtues, so that what would otherwise be hard and difficult her
   love makes feasible and easy. -- The soid's third king is will. When in
   the flower of his strength he brings the soul the fire of love, which
   tries her through and through and consumes away all the sinful
   affections of her nature, then she is fixed, and neither life nor death
   nor any creature can separate her from the love of God. So they bring
   her myrrh to keep her from the rot of temiwral things which to the soul
   arc a fertile source of evil. St Ambrose says, Gk)d pours forth the
   soul creating and pouring forth he creates her.' And when she is in
   love with him, immediately he comes to her, as his spiritual bride
   admits where she says in the Book of Love, While I was at rest upon my
   bed my love came tapping at my window and he put in his hand and
   touched me.' This suggests that when the soul comes to know herself she
   withdraws from all the things which are present to her here, for she
   herself is of greater worth and higher status than any of the other
   things in time. When now the loving soul has gone out of all creatures
   and herself, then the eternal truth comes forth as well to meet the
   loving soul and touch her understanding and exalt it with his

   light which more enriches her than all the knowledge of material things
   hitherto amassed by her own nature. St Augustine says,

   As the sun shines through glass and makes its contents plain, so is the
   soul's intelligence illumined by the light of God with the recog-
   nition of her divine abilities.* Then the soul is seen in her poverty
   and God in his purity. Indeed Dionysius says as much when he speaks of
   the naked soul, one with her naked God, resting in the desert of the
   Godhead.' It may well be called a desert, for crea- ture never looked
   therein by grace. Ignorance of these matters is just cause for shame.
   Yet if one of the chief angels should descend and, with creatures all
   as w^ise as he, discourse of human happiness, they might talk till
   doomsday and not tell the tale of all God has in store for every loving
   soul in life eternal. But the soul must not seek God for any reason
   except God himself. The emptier she keeps the more God fills her and
   the more ])erfectly he does his work in her ; besides, it is the safest
   way, for then at any moment she will be prepared to quit the body at
   God's instance rather than remain there at her own. And being so poor
   of self she will find naught but God both here and yonder. There is no
   call for such a soul to look outside herself : the Holy Ghost will
   teach her the elements of bliss in the school of her own heart. She
   cherishes the gift wherewith God has endowed his best beloved. And the
   better to fulfil God's will in everything she does she trains herself
   never to be without pure consciousness so that the heavenly Father can
   go on ever giving birth in her to his eternal Word, Jesus Christ his
   Son. For at her highest point my soul is not in time and does not work
   in time and is just as neaf td things a thousand miles away as to this
   spot I stand on.

   J^hcorctically speaking, nothing that takes shape or is touched by time
   can get into the soul, and not only time but likeness. The head of the
   soul is her highest power, and from the moment she was made she has
   never for an instant been without the boon of this divine light, this
   power in which the time God made the world in and the judgment day are
   just as present to the soul as this time wherein I speak. Being in the
   power of her head the soul enjoys the benefit of participation in the
   grace and happiness common to all saints as though they were her own.
   It is certainly the fact that anyone actually in this head never
   commits sin and knows so much about eternal bliss and is so well
   informed that he needs no sermons. Wherefore erecting the head of the
   soul let us gather ourselves up into the breadth and freedom of a power
   like this and depart from temporal to eternal things when, in this same
   power, God suddenly gives birth to all he is in might and truth and
   wisdom in the soul. Verily the soul in whom this grace is found is
   absolutely pure and every whit like God. For anything

   well-pleasing to the Father or which makes for our profit or our weal,
   must be well-pleasing to him in his Son, because apart from him he has
   no likes whatever. This then is the nobility which God has implanted in
   the soul, her beatific nature which is receptive to the grace of God,
   so that in this grace the light of God's pure nature can shine into the
   soul and the Word of the Trinity be spoken in her mind and the life of
   eternity energise in her.

   Theologians say the soul is a suspended force in the power of the
   Father and a reflected light in the wisdom of the Son and a circulation
   in the sweetness of the Holy Ghost. According to St Augustine, the soul
   comes from the heavenly land, out of the paternal heart ; the offspring
   of God's love and scion of the noble house of the holy Trinity, she is
   the heir to heaven, the mistress of all creatures and the proprietor of
   all the joys God gives in his eternity. She is the image of God and the
   noblest creature that ever God conceived. For God gripped in between
   his divine nature and his Godhood, into his eternal essence, and
   produced the soul from nothing, just as he made from nothing heaven and
   earth and all things. If you ask how big the soul is, know, she is too
   big for heaven and earth to fill, or even God himself whom the heavens
   cannot comprehend. To measure the soul you must gauge her with God. And
   she is so beautiful as long as she is in the grace of God and not
   deformed by sin, the highest angels, Seraphim and Cherubim and all the
   saints try in vain to copy her in form and likeness, for she is God's
   image. As to her life in time, she is flowing back to her natural
   source whence she issued forth ; and the freer she has kept herself
   from temporal forms and creatures the kinder her return to God, for God
   is absolutely free from matter, mode and form. For the soul to compare
   with the abstract spirit of God she must be free from the smallest
   trace of sensible affection and quite without attachment to anything
   not God. That such perfect freedom is not known to every spirit is due
   solely to our undiscovered life and our untaught senses. All the
   potential good in creatures the soul will find in God together with
   inestimable joy. St Augustine says, When everything was still that
   existed in me God spake a silent Word within my soul, which no one
   understood but me.' And to whatever soul this Word is said she will
   forget all modes and forms and become an in-dweller with God. Thus St
   Paul relates, From the moment the eternal Word was revealed within my
   soul I no linger lived for flesh and blood.' Inasmuch as she is
   selfless she is self-possessed and strong. The faithful, loving soul is
   like the bee, sipping from all kinds of flowers the sweets to make its
   honey. And even so the soul culls from the flowers of virtue somewhat
   of each one to heal and fortify her. It is a crying need for she has
   three mortal

   foes : the world, the flesh and the devil, hanging all together like
   three cherries on one stem. Of these three foes the deadliest is the
   body, wherein the soul is clapt as into prison : not that she may
   pander to its vicious appetites but to say them nay and by this
   resistance daily to augment her reward in heaven and here the love
   inpoured. It was Seneca, the heathen philosopher, who said, Man is his
   own worst enemy.' Death stands at the door of evil appetites, and the
   pursuit of vice leads into paths which seem all right to us but
   sometimes they debouch in the pit of hell. If the soul, the mistress of
   the body, indulges its base appetites and fails to check its sins she
   has herself to blame when either here or yonder she must pay for it to
   God. And that there may be no escaping from God's justice for them that
   kill the soul with sin and end in fleshly lusts, he says in the prophet
   Amos, My wrath shall drive over you like a chariot, cracking with its
   weight ; my anger the swift shall not outrun nor the valiant turn aside
   nor yet the strong man conquer with his strength. Not one shall escape
   me, how fair or strong or mighty soever he may be.' And seeing that the
   soul has such a high and heavenly destiny, therefore Meister Elckhart
   of Paris, at the end of the aforesaid things, which are taken from his
   writings, sets the following prayer :

   O Sovran Riches of Divine Nature, show me thy way which thou in thy
   wisdom hast ordained and open to me thy most precious treasure whereto
   thou hast called me : to know with supercreaturely intelligence, to
   love with the angels, to enjoy with thy only Son our Lord Jesus Christ
   and to be thine heir to Sternal wisdom and by thy help to be preserved
   from evil. For thou hast exalted me above all creatures and hast sealed
   me with the seal of thine eternal image and put my soul beyond the
   grasp of creatures and hast made nothing liker to thyself than man is
   in his soul. Teach me to live so that I never want thee ; so as never
   to hinder the working of thy love-stream in me ; so as never to lend
   myself to any outward pleasure without thee nor occupy my mind more
   with any creature than with thee. Lord thou art spirit and
   incomprehensible to creature ; thou dost inspire the soul and raise her
   to an order above creature so that she can do thy will, O Eternal
   Wisdom, and in grace be free from inroad of unbidden images. Thou hast
   made the soul to suit thyself in her nature and her laws and she
   maintains she has no room for anyone but thee. O Almighty and Most
   Merciful Creator and dear Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner and help me
   to overcome all pitfalls with their lures to idle pleasure ; to shun in
   thought and act what thou forbiddest and both to do and keep all thy
   commands ; help me to believe, to hope, to love ; to live and feel
   exactly as

   toward thee. Grant me a clear and sober and genuinely prayerful mind
   with real intuition of thy will, together with the love and joy which
   make it easy to perform. Lord, vouchsafe me always modest progress
   towards better things and never to backslide. And, O my Lord, condemn
   me not, as I deserve, to rely on my own powers or on human weak- ness
   and unwisdom but on thy good providence alone. Direct me Lord to The
   Good itself, my every thought and act to thine own liking, so that on

   THE SOUL'S PERFECTION!

   Speaking of the final perfection of the soul theologians ask. What is
   meant by saying that the spirit in its understanding has become the
   intellectual existence of the eternal essence in the perennial now with
   nothing between ? That is the first question. The second question is.
   How can the spirit make good its intellectual return into the
   unchanging, and have the eternal image in perfect clearness and
   essential intimacy and in the interior freedom of the spirit ? The
   third question is about the highest flight of the spirit, its nearest
   approach of all to the divine presence and whether its own powers are
   equal to the task ?

   First, we must remember how the divine being proceeded forth in the
   present now, with falling man, the gist of it, immediate in his
   spiritual prototype in virtue of its nearness and also by reason of the
   inherent now of its light of glory and intellectual image from which
   the intellect sees back quite clearly to the un-proceeded splendour of
   its eternally immanent spiritual exemplar wherein it is nameless and
   beyond all words which are creaturely. The word is in the eternal Word
   and one presence with it and God with his whole nature and the full
   range of his power can make out of his essence nothing more resembling
   the divine species in the ground divine nature and reflecting him so
   well. He who receives the light of the spirit as it is the image of
   God, wherein is no part, that is the medium of perfection, for therein
   his spirit is one with divine nature.

   As to the second question, you must understand that although the
   intelligible image of God in the spirit partakes in its nature and
   purity more of the perfection of the content of its immanent essence
   than of the emanation of itself, nevertheless it is therein essence
   that has become. Take the spirit in its nearest ground, abiding within
   in its endless image and eternal image. As the endless image it is
   always within and in its eternal image it presents itself as an eternal
   question. As Christ asks, Whose is this image and this superscription ?
   ' Mark the difference between this image and its superscription. In the
   image exists God, and all his output in spirit and in nature -- the
   human mind (or spirit) with all it is able to afford, -- these are in
   uniformity so exact and close that the image of divine glory shines in
   all its detail in the spirit and this image in the spirit is perfectly
   reflected back into its indwelling essence. So much for the image of
   God. And what of the superscription ? That is the unspeakable species
   of the divine nature, which in its whole ground, actual and essential,
   is a naked and immediate presence in the spirit, in virtue of which the
   spirit in its free nature and intellectual image suffers all God's
   super-rational operation. The limit comes where the divine freedom
   seizes the spirit's freedom and turns it into foolishness and at this
   point all scientific knowledge fails ; there is no further progress to
   be made by natural creature-knowledge but only in spirit by
   experiencing God.

   Now to answer the third question. Philosophers say that one's own is
   ever innate and can be had at will. It follows .thfit the spirit can
   rise to the supreme perfection of its divine nature for it can stand in
   its first now, in that wherein it was not. And that is the answer to
   the third query.

   Then there is the question, can God leave man's spirit to itself or not
   ? I say, No, it would be against the justice of his nature and against
   his truth and would make a travesty of God's whole creation. God must
   cither let the spirit be God extra to himself or else he must merge it
   in himself, when it has left all things. This will not outrage God, for
   the spirit is too haughty and touches too closely the honour of God for
   him to be able to make aught but himself the end of its perfection. It
   has this unique property : its ground can overleap all spirits into his
   super-intelligible spirit, namely, the indwelling essence of divine
   nature.

   A man was asked, What dost thou lack ? He said. Nothing, except poverty
   of spirit. -- And though I have a will no bigger than a grain of
   mustard seed I am no poor man, and if God were to ask me. Art thou a
   poor man ? I should reply that, be my will as good as God's yet am I
   not poor, not even if with that same will I do as much as God, And why
   ? Because God and God's will

   are one, I and my will are two, for I am a man and not God and if I
   mean to do real work entirely without or free from will then I must
   emulate the stone which lies in the water and the water Hows over it
   but enters not into the stone. Even so if I were a poor man I should do
   my works in such a way that they entered not into my will any more than
   the water does into the stone : I should do them simply at the will of
   God. And if again God asked me, whether I was poor and if I replied, I
   have abandoned my own will and did I know the will of God that would I
   do,' I might be assuming something not my own, for no one knoweth who
   we are, though we are not the truth for God can change^^our knowledge,
   not his knowledge, because he is the truth and we are not.

   Perhaps someone will say, How can I do my work like this, will -free ?
   The answer is, I ought to do my work as though no one existed, no one
   lived, no one had ever come upon the earth. Then if God asked me once
   again. Art thou a poor man ? and if I replied, I am unworthy of that
   knowing,' that were the barest poverty that ever I heard tell of or
   went through : the deepest, direst poverty. Yet all the while I have
   within enough of place for God to do his work in me, to give his gift
   to me, all that while I am not a poor man for all that while 1 am
   expecting God. -- What more can I do ? -- Thus shalt thou do : thou
   shalt leave all willing and knowing and receiving of things and at the
   very point where thou hast left all things there God has given thee all
   things ; he durst, not give thee more nor any more work with thee nor
   canst thou take in more, but thou shalt simply leave thyself. That is
   poverty of spirit the most near of all, for none is downright poor but
   he who wills not, knows not, has not, whether within or without. To the
   eternal truth, God help us. Amen.

   That great teacher St Paul says in his epistle, Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of
   all comfort, who cornforteth us in all our tribulation.' Three kinds of
   tribulation may fall upon a man and plunge him in distress. First,
   misfortune to exterior belongings. Next, to our dearest friends.
   Lastly, to ourselves : shame, hardship, pain of body and distress of
   mind.

   So 1 purpose in this book to impart some teachings apt to console a man
   in all adversity, unhappiness and suffering. And

   having therein and therefrom culled sundry general truths to com- fort
   him in any trouble, he will find thereafter thirty rules or maxims each
   of which alone is sufficient for his solace ; and after that again, in
   the third part of the book, he will find precepts and examples,
   theoretical and practical, the sayings and doings of the wise in times
   of tribulation.^

   1

   In the first place we must bear in mind that the wise and wisdom, true
   and truth, good and goodness, righteousness and righteous are closely
   related to each other. Goodness is not made nor created nor begotten :
   it is procreative and begets the good and the good man, so far as he is
   good, is the unmade, un- created but withal begotten child and son of
   goodness. Goodness reproduces itself and all it is in good things :
   knowledge, love, energy, it pours forth all of them into the good man,
   and the good man receives all his being, kiiowing, love and energy from
   the central depth of goodness and from that alone. Good and good- ness
   are no more than goodness by itself, except as unborn parent and horn
   child of goodness therefrom. In the good is but one being and one life.
   All that belongs to a good man he gets both from the good and in the
   good. Therein he is and lives and dwells and there he knows himself,
   and all he knows and loves he wills and works with goodness and in
   goodness and the good does all its work with him and in him, iis it is
   written. The Son said, My Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
   works. , AJl that belongs to the Father is mine ; all that is mine is
   my Father's : his giving is my taking.'

   Further we must remember that the Name or Word stands for nothing else,
   nothing more or less than the good, pure and simple. But when we call
   him good we understand his goodness to be given him, infused and
   engendered by the unborn goodness ; in the words of the gospel, As the
   Father hath life in himself so hath he given to the Son to have the
   same life in himself also.' In himself, he says, not from himself for
   the Father gave it to him.

   Now all that I have said of good and goodness equally applies to true
   and truth, to right (or just) and righteousness (or justice), to wise
   and wisdom, to God's Son and to God the Father, to every God-begotten
   thing that has no father upon earth and wherein is gotten no created
   thing : nothing not God, and wherein exists not any form at all but
   that of God alone. St John says in his gospel, to them gave he power to
   become the sons of (iod, which were born not of blood nor of the will
   of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God alone.'

   ^ Only Part I is givon here.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   By blood he means everything in man not subject to the human will. By
   fleshly will he means everything in man which is subject to his will,
   albeit with reluctance and with an inclination to fleshly appetites : a
   thing which is common to the body and the soul and not confined to the
   soul alone, which accounts for the weakness and exhaustion of their
   powers. By the will of man St John means the highest power of the soul,
   whose nature and energy, unmixed with flesh, resides in the pure nature
   of the soul, detached from time and place and from everything that
   smacks of time and place relation ; that has naught in common with
   naught ; wherein man is formed in the image of God ; wherein he is of
   the lineage of God, and God's kindred. Yet since these are not God
   himself but are products of the soul and arc in the soul, therefore
   they have to lose their form and be transformed into God alone : born
   into God and out of God with only God for father. Then they are Son
   indeed, God's only Son.

   I am his Son forasmuch as he begets me in his nature and forms me in
   his image. Such an one is the Son of God, good son of goodness, right
   son of righteousness. So far as he is simply good he is unborn parent
   and as born Son he has the same nature as righteousness has, and is and
   is possessed of all the characiter oT justice and truth. In all this
   teaehing which is found in holy gospel and confirmed in the natural
   light of the wise soul there is solace for every human sorrow.

   St Augustine says, God is not far nor long. If thou wouldst- find him,
   neither far nor long betake thyself to God, for there a thousand years
   are as one day, to-day.' And withal I say, in God there is no pain or
   sorrow or distress. And if thou wouldst be free from all adversity and
   pain, turn thee and cleave to God and to God alone. Doubtless all thy
   ills arc due to thy non- conversion into God and to God alone. If thou
   wert formed and gotten in righteousness alone, things could no more
   pain thee than righteousness, than God himself.

   Solomon says, The righteous will not grieve for aught that may befall
   him.' He does not say the righteous man or the righteous angel, not
   this or that right thing ; just righteous, being right, for the
   righteous man is son with a father upon earth, he is creature, made or
   created as his father is creature made or created. He says righteous,
   pure and simple, and that has no made or created father, for
   righteousness is the same as God. So pain and sorrow can molest him no
   more than they do God. Justice will not grieve him, for love and joy
   and bliss arc justice, and if justice made sorrowful the just it would
   be causing sorrow to itself. Injustice, inequality, can in no wise
   grieve the just, for anything created being far beneath him has no
   influence and

   TRACTATES 811

   makes no impression on the righteous nor is it gotten into him whose
   only father is God.

   A man then ought to set to work and de-form himself of him- self and
   creatures and know no father except God alone. Then nothing will be
   able to afflict or cast him down, neither God nor creature, uncreated
   or created, and his entire being, life, know- ledge, love and wisdom
   will be from God and in God and God.

   There is another thing which is wont to comfort us in any tribulation.
   It is the certainty that the just and virtuous man delights
   unspeakably, incomparably more in doing right than he or even the chief
   angel delights and rejoices in his natural economy or life. The saints
   will gladly sacrifice their lives for right.

   Supposing now that when outward ills befall the good and righteous man
   he keeps his even temper and his peace of mind, this only proves my
   argument that the righteous man is proof against external happenings.
   But suppose he is perturbed by these mishaps then it stands to reason
   that God is only just in sending trials to a person who while
   pretending to be righteous and fondly thinking himself so is yet upset
   by so small a thing. Since it is fair of God, he has no cause to mind
   but rather to rejoice, far more than he does at his own life, at what
   rejoices man and is of more good to him than this world all told ; for
   what profits a man the whole world when he is no more ?

   The third important thing for us to understand is the elemental truth
   that the fount and living artery of universal good, essential tnith and
   perfect consolation is God, God only, and everything not God has in
   itself a natural bitterness, discomfort and unhappiness and docs not
   make for good which is of God and is the same as Ciod, but lessens,
   dims and hides the sweetness, joy and comfort that God gives.

   And further I maintain, all sorrow comes from love of that whereof 1 am
   deprived by loss. If I mind the loss of outward things it is a certain
   sign that I am fond of outward things and really love sorrow and
   discomfort. Is it to be wondered at that I am unhappy when I like
   discomfort and unhappiness ; when my heart seeks and my mind gives to
   creature the good that is God's own ? I turn towards creature, whence
   there comes by nature all discomfort, and turn my back on that which is
   the natural source of happiness and comfort; what wonder I am woebegone
   and wretched ! The fact is, it is quite impossible for God or anyone to
   bring true solace to a man who looks for it in creatures. But he who
   loves only God in creatures and creatures in God only, that man finds
   real and true and equal comfort everywhere.

   SISTER KATREl

   MEISTER ECKHART's STRASBURG DAIJCHITER

   Blessed and praised be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
   provided for us an image of the truth, himself namely, wherein is no
   possibility of error !

   We read in the gospel that our Lord fed the multitude with five loaves
   and two roast fishes. The first loaf we interpret to mean the knowledge
   of what we have always been in God and what we are in God now. The
   second loaf is the scrutiny of our life in time : seeing how our time
   has been spent. And for this we need help in the shape of a trusty
   confessor. A confessor we judge of in this way. If he has what is tnie
   we may safely confide in him. There arc three signs of this. First, he
   is a true priest. Secondly, he is confirmed in the perfect life. And
   thirdly, he has the authority which stamps the true priest. Him seek
   where- soever thou shalt find him. It is well worth any trouble. Go to
   him and solemnly kneeling before him as Mary Magdalene knelt at the
   feet of our Lord Jesus CJirist, earnestly entreat him for God's sake to
   hear thee. Then open thy heart to him as thou shalt appear in the eyes
   of our Lord Jesus Christ at the day of judgment when all things arc
   revealed in truth. Discard shame in the kndwledgc that God has seen and
   heard all thy sins, and so too have those who are reflected into God
   from the face of the mirror of truth ; they know thy shortcomings
   better than thou dost thyself. Be not ashamed before thy confessor, be
   ashamed before God and the friends of God, acquiring godly fear in the
   realization that God's divine glance has seen thy every will, word and
   act ; and opening thy heart pour out thy sins till, the whole tale
   being told, thou dost fervently pray him : Sir, ghostly father, I
   entreat thee by the love that bound Christ on the cross, show me the
   nearest way to my eternal happiness.'

   Upon this it is open to thy confessor to indicate three ways with which
   it behoves thee to be quite familiar. Setting thee thy penance,
   instructs thee to repair wrongs done ; he bids thee restore goods not
   thine own ; he enjoins thee to make amends for aught thou hast done to
   another that thou wouldst not he should do unto thee. Word, will, and
   act ; what was willed without effect must be willed to more purpose,
   thy will being such that thou wouldst sooner die a thousand deaths than
   plan a mischief to thine evenchristian. Thy wicked will, which is
   toward evil

   deeds, endeavour to correct. Where thou wast haughty now walk humbly
   for all the world to see thou repentest thee of thy pride. Pride I
   single out, knowing it for a temporal fault most fatal to our eternal
   happiness. False pride robs spiritual no less than worldly folks of
   their eternal bliss. Dost know what pride is ? Flattery of yourself or
   other people is false pride which cheats you of eternal happiness.

   Next, examine yourselves for sloth in God's service. Not doing thy best
   is sloth in God's service. To meet this, set to and do good, showing by
   diligence thy sorrow for thine egregious dereliction ; yet remaining
   detached withal and regardless of aught but God and the friends of God.

   Thereafter it behoves tliee to check thy third sin. Where thou wast
   greedy now be liberal and let thy bounty attest thy whole- hearted
   abhorrence of greed. Dost know what greed is ? Desire of anything not
   God is evil greed.

   The fourth sin is envy and hate : bearing malice and hatred towards any
   with intent to do unto him what thou wouldst not he should do unto
   thee. Hast injured any man by act of thine, repair the injury at any
   cost. Hast tarnished his fair name by word of thine, thy words must
   brighten it again : abasing thyself before him, entreat him humbly for
   God's sake to forgive thee and reiterate thy rueful supplieation till
   he grant thee his free pardon. Call people's attention to this, withal
   speaking so well of the man that thou dost win him back honour no less
   than thou didst filch from him. Know forsooth, ere thou canst find
   favour with God thou must needs pay in full for wrongs done *to thine
   cvenchristians. Disparagement is mischievous. Worldly goods we can
   replace but stolen honour cannot be restored save by the payment of our
   own. So weigh thy words well, friend.

   The fifth sin is anger. Reckon up words and deeds done in anger and
   cancel them with kindness. Pe rad venture thou hast spoken in anger
   words which, if adhered to, shall doom thee to eternal death. A word
   said here may reach to Rome, and from Rome to overseas : how^ then
   recall it ? Thus : man pays his debts through God. Saying, Shall 1 not
   tell the truth ? folks canvass the failings of their cvenchristians and
   forget their own. I say, though thou seest and hearest the faults of
   thine even- christians, betray them not. If so be that thou canst not
   for- bear the mention of them, then go and see the person privately,
   just you and he together ; point out his faults to him in a friendly
   manner and invite him by thine own excellent precept and example to
   eschew his vicious habits. If he will not forswear them, acquaint the
   right authorities and leave it at that, allowing nothing of it to
   escape thy lips however much he vex thee. For know, to rebuke

   him for sin in thine anger is to commit mortal sin : raising him out of
   sin thou dost fall in thyself. The sinner of to-day is the saint of
   to-morrow. Wherefore, unmindful of the sins and short- comings of our
   evenchristians, let us look to our own imper- fections, surely
   forgetting what God has forgotten : sins truly repented, which God has
   forgotten, 'tis no business of ours to remember.

   The sixth sin is eating and drinking to excess : eating, perhaps, two
   regular meals or three while thine evcnchristian goes hungry and
   thirsty, who is nigher to God than thou art, and liker to boot ; for he
   is poor while thou art rich in temporal things. Christ said, Blessed
   are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' These frailties it
   behoves thee to amend so thoroughly that God must needs forgive them
   thee.

   The seventh sin in unehastity. Concerning this a heathen master says :
   All superfluity, anything unnecessary in word or deed, is unehastity.'
   The traverner sets his hoop to a mark when he goes to sell wine. When
   the wine is sold, he takes off the hooj). So let them do who are minded
   to cure the sin of unehastity : let them avoid excess in word and deed
   and walk right humbly and soberly before the world, so all shall say
   that anything to be called excess offends them.

   Thy next care, daughter, is whether thou hast kept the ten commandments
   ail thy days. To take one that Christ mentions,

   Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and
   with all thy strength,' thou canst be shown to have broken this
   frequently. And breaking this commandment thou dost break them all. It
   behoves thee to tell thy confessor how often thou hast broken it from
   childhood up. It would take too long to go through all the ten
   commandments and say what thou must tell to thy confessor. Thou wilt
   see that for thyself better than we can tell thee.

   Then, the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost : how often thou hast resisted
   them and hast failed to practise the seven works of mercy, wherefor God
   shall arrantly upbraid thee at the day of judgment. Make a fresh start,
   my daughter, so mending thy ways that God is obliged to forget thy
   shortcomings.

   Such is the first counsel of the worthy confessor and the first way. To
   the question : Sir, is it the best way ? ' he will answer,

   No, but what I am telling thee is indispensable.' Says she,

   Then, sir, tell me the best way.' He answers, Bide till thou hast made
   thine own this counsel I have given thee ; bide till thou hast cast thy
   sins ; and meanwhile come often to see me.'

   Obedient to her revered confessor, the daughter does this. She often
   comes back to him and says, Sir, I will obey you to

   the death if you will help me so to live that I am bold to die.' --
   Hast cast thy sins ? ' he asked. Aye,' she replied, so far as I shall
   ever do it here in time ; and will do till I die.' -- Then 1 will
   redirect thee, and give thee fresh instructions. Keep a truthful
   tongue, a pure body and a loving soul. A code that may be construed
   thus : A truthful tongue means that the lips utter only the intentions
   of the heart. Thus thou shalt speak the truth, daughter. God is truth,
   so thy whole conversation shall be of God ; not praying nor thinking of
   God thou thus speakest of God, and art ever receiving from God.

   A pure body means that, pierced with godly fear, thou sufferest naught
   save God to dwell in thee.

   A loving soul is one that loves her likes, God namely. Unite thyself
   with him until thee thinks thy heart is fit to burst with too much
   love.' Whereat the daughter cried, And 1 an utter stranger to it !
   Sir,' she said, shall I ever come acquainted with it ? ' He said, Yes.
   Do as 1 bid you : discard the things that are darkening thy soul, and
   let the light of truth in. Then thy soul can retrace the road she
   came.'

   Hy the third loaf wc understand God's mercy. Consider, daughter, the
   plenteous comptission that God has shown thee. When, having endowed
   thee with frci; will, thou didst of thy free will incur eternal death,
   he ransomed thee with his own self and washing thee in his own blood
   did cleanse thee from original sin. Observe further God's mercy in
   being ready to forgive thy sins as often as thou scekest grace in time.
   To enumerate God's mercies time would fail us though we lived till
   doomsda/. Folks talk of God's providence. Know, what God has provided
   for us is his eternal felicity, in token whereof he has given us free
   will to do good and eschew evil.

   At this point it behoves us to determine whether wc truly repent us of
   our sins. Wouldst know the quality of true repentance ? It has to be so
   strong in thee that thou wouldst sooner die a thousand deaths than sin
   one sin. There be many that say I truly repent me of my sins ' who yet
   remain in sin. Speaking falsely they augment their sin. Thou virtuous
   soul who wouldst enjoy God's mercy and be baptized in the Holy Ghost,
   repent thee thrice : (first) for the sins thou hast committed against
   the Lord thy God by word and deed. Repent thee next of sins against
   thine even Christians. If thou wouldst taste God's clemency and have
   him to forgive thy sins and dowse thee with his Holy Ghost in grace,
   then show the mercy due to all mankind made in Christ's image as they
   are, whether or not they shall have sinned against thee : needs must if
   thou art ever to find grace. The third repentance is heartfelt pity for
   thyself, bred from a survey of the

   happy days that God has granted thee for finding thy eternal happiness,
   he having made all creatures for signposts to thy highest good. As St
   Augustine says : All creatures point me to my good ; Lord, I deeply rue
   that if I ever get to thee 'tis by thy mercy. The time goes by that
   thou hast given me and thou art still unknown to me and unbeloved :
   hence my regret. And yet I fear me, Lord, I never felt the true rue
   that I ought.'

   By the fourth loaf we understand God's justice. Innately, he is as just
   as he is merciful. Yet know, were I to tell you of God's jus- tice,
   'twould be too hard for you : precious few would look for grace. Hence
   we emphasise God's mercy, who throws souls into purgatory to find grace
   at the judgment day if not before. Know that in itself God's justice is
   of a sternness that must make all tremble. Well knowing this, Christ
   said to his disciples : Having done all that is possible to you, say.
   We arc unprofitable servants.' We learn this from St John also, who,
   though he did no sin to separate him from Ck)d yet likened himself to
   the beasts of the forest. Surely he knew God's truth. I say, moreover,
   God's justice is so harsh that, though a man should do all the good
   works wrought by the company of saints now in eternal life, yet, being
   found in any mortal sin (the first is pride ; the second, slothfulness
   in God's service ; the third, hate ; the fourth, anger ; the fifth,
   greed ; the sixth, overeating and drinking ; the seventh, unchastity ;
   these are the seven deadly sins), being found, I say, in one of these,
   he would be lost eternally. I hold it would avail him nothing for all
   the saints in heaven to intercede for him. I affirm, moreover, were
   Christ to supplfcate his Father, and Mary his mother, 'twould not avail
   to save his soul. Further, concerning this I say that I would sooner
   have the man who sins a thousand mortal sins and knows it, than him who
   sins but one in ignorance : that man is lost. I hold he may have
   practised every virtue of Holy Christendom and it will not avail him,
   he is damned with the lost, while he of a thousand conscious sins is
   saved, provided that, renouncing them heartily in true repentance,
   never to do them more, he mends his ways, steadfast in love till death.
   That man ranks with the saints. Ah, daughter, mark those souls who, all
   their days exempt from mortal sins, can say with the young man, I have
   kept thy com- mandments all my life.' Would to God I knew one person
   who could even say, All my days have I kept the first of Christ's
   commandments, Thou shalt love thy God with all thy soul-powers,' and
   who has been preserved the while from spiritual pride.

   The fifth loaf signifies true faith. It means absolute trust in God. He
   who believes in God trusts God and knows God and therefore loves God.
   Observe, woman, having true faith means believing in God's omnipotence.

   has true faith as much as a grain of mustard seed, can remove
   mountains/ Wherefore it behoves us assiduously to free our- selves from
   things corruptible, which dim the light wherein we see the true faith,
   which is God. To be able to say, I am a true Christian,' a man must
   subsist in Christ in the sense that Christ is his exemplar whereto he
   is conformed in word and deed. Know, that whatever Christ did he did to
   edify us in eternal truth, for he is the truth itself ; he (»an
   initiate thee into the true faith. What I say is, that to get to the
   Father we must go to him in Christ ; to know the Father we must know
   him in Christ. And so Christ taught. When Philip asked him, Show us the
   Father,' Christ answered, He who seeth me seeth the Father, and where
   the Father is there I am.' Plainly then, we must follow the lead of the
   Beloved if we would be saved. People say, How can I do as Christ did ?
   ' Christ tells us how. He said, Take up your (^ross and follow me.'
   Which do not understand to mean he bids you die the death he died upon
   the cross. His words were,

   Follow me,' meaning wc arc to imitate his perfect life. Our temporal
   failure to imitate his life in word and deed is our eternal failure.
   Concerning this he said, In my Father's house arc many mansions.' For
   you must know that many a man who goes to heaven no more enjoys the
   light of God's countenance than sunshine in forest gloom. Nay, friend,
   mark what Christ said to the kinswoman who besought him for her son. He
   said, He who drinks of the cup I wot of shall be joint heir with me in
   my Father's kingdom.' Which being interpreted means : by our measure
   here it shall be meted to us again by our heavenly Father in his
   eternal kingdom. As St Augustine says : So far as we know and love here
   we profit eternally.'

   Theologians speak of hell. I will tell you what hell is. It is merely a
   state. Your state here is your eternal state. This is hell. Take an
   illustration. A thief who has incurred the penalty of death on being
   caught : picture his state of mind seeing others happy ! So do we feel,
   and worse. And so with those in hell who see God and his friends : the
   height of torment, so the masters say.

   This learnt, the aforementioned daughter goes to her revered confessor.
   She says, Sir, tell me the best way to my eternal happiness.' Quoth he,
   Daughter, let be.' -- I shall never let be,' she said, so long as my
   eternal happiness is not assured.' He said, Thou art sure of eternal
   life, daughter.' -- But, sir,' she persisted, have you told me the
   nearest way to it ? ' -- Any creature will tell you that,' he said.
   With one accord they all exclaim : Pass on, wc are not God. 'Tis
   direction enough, daughter.' -- Not for me, sir,' she said. Said he, An

   not believe me, at least thou wilt credit the words of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who said : Take up thy cross and follow me. He did not say,
   Take up my cross and follow me. What he meant was : be content to do
   thy best, knowing that therewith God too is satisfied.' -- Would I had
   done my best,' she cried. -- What wouldst thou do ? ' he asked. She
   answered, I would leave honour and possessions and friends and kindred
   and the outward solace I get from creatures.' -- Wouldst leave me too ?
   ' asked her confessor. She answered, Aye, sir ; leaving all things, I
   must leave you also.' -- Essay it not,' he said, 'tis not for a woman.'
   Quoth she, Full well I wot no woman can enter heaven till she loe man.
   That means she must do man's work and have the strength of mind to
   withstand him and all imper- fections.' -- Thou deemst thyself mighty
   strong ! I wonder now, how thou wouldst like to bear more than thou
   hast already.' She said, I can bear all, sir, that Christ has borne for
   me.' He said, These are words ! ' She said, It is true.' -- Canst prove
   it ? ' said he. With ease,' said she. I have heard tell that in none of
   Christ's sufferings did his Godhead come to the help of his manhood.'
   He said, That is true. The Godhead is impassible ; it never has
   suffered and never can suffer, seeing that nothing affects it.' Quoth
   she, What Christ bore, I can bear.' He said, Tell me how.' -- I will,'
   she replied. Right well I ween Christ was the noblest man that ever was
   born : from threescore kings and twelve he was descended ; and I say,
   moreover, he was the best heart's-blood of Mary. See now my proof that
   I am fit to bear all he boVe for me. Taking the test of breeding, the
   best bred are the tenderest. It follows that I can bear more than
   Christ can.' Said he, Were I to tell you all I know of the perfection
   of his life in time in right willing poverty, 'twere like to break my
   heart. Bethink thee well ! ' She said, I have bethought me. This very
   day I mean to follow the dictates of the Holy Ghost.' -- What does the
   Holy Ghost dictate ? ' he asked. She answered, He counsels me to leave
   myself in the mighty hands of God and to sever my ties with creatures.'
   -- Thou art wrong,' he said. How so ? ' said she. He said, In not
   taking advice. Obedience is a virtue, as thou knowest.'~ " I am
   obedient unto death,' she said.

   To whom ? ' he queried. To Christ and his heavenly Father to whom John
   was obedient in the wilderness, and Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt
   and Mary Salome.' Quoth he, It seems thou wilt no longer mind me.' --
   You are right,' she cried ; I am heartily sorry I listened so long to
   the counsels of men and was deaf to the counsel of the Holy Ghost.' --
   Now listen to me, my daughter. What thinkst thou I have done to thee ?
   ' -- You have kept me from eternal bliss,' she said. How so ? ' he
   asked. She answered,

   By not telling me outright the quickest way to it.' -- It is obedience
   to the Holy Ghost,' he said. I should never counsel thee other- wise
   than I have counselled thee.' -- If you had not discouraged me,' she
   said, and other spiritual folks to boot, I should have spent my time
   more virtuously. I weened, forsooth, it were the gospel that priests
   propagated.' -- The gospel is begotten in the Holy Ghost of the perfect
   life of our Lord Jesus Christ and according to his noble teachings. We
   read and preach the gospel openly : he who would follow it let him
   follow it to the utmost.' -- God forgive me for not doing so all my
   days,' said she. Quoth he, I grieve thou shouldst accuse me of
   preventing thee.'- Aye,' she replied, I accuse you and all creatures.'
   -- Thou art mistook,' he said. No one can hinder thee but thine own
   self. Know, whom God impels none can resist : not all the saints in
   heaven nor all the preaching friars and barefoot monks on earth can
   stand against one man moved by the truth. He is impelled by that same
   word which Christ spoke, answering the youth who sought the perfect
   life. Christ said ; Keep the ten commandments. The young man replied,
   All these have I kept from my youth up. Then said Christ, If thou wilt
   be perfect, sell all thou hast and give to the poor and follow me.
   Christ made known this same truth to us by Peter and others of his
   disciples whom he called to live with him in willing poverty. Thou
   knowest, daughter, that what Christ said and did is true, for he is
   truth itself ; and know more- over, that to reach the Father wc must
   walk in Christ's footsteps all the way.' Quoth she, Well then, good
   father, why be so discouraging ? ' -- 'Tis such a flawless life,' he
   said, anyone leading it God must needs come and help.'-- God docs not
   come and go,' she said ; that I do know. I wot right well when we
   resign our- selves to him he does not fail to succour us at need.'
   Quoth he, What if all creatures despise thee ? ' She said, I want to be
   the least of creatures in our Lord Jesus Christ, the lowest of his
   creatures ; then I can say with Paul, Rejoice, all creatures are my
   cross and I the cross of creatures.' He said, Daughter, thou art too
   young.' -- " Mary was younger than I,' she said, when she set forth
   into the desert and exile, driven by robbery and murder.' -- God was
   with her,' said he. And well I wot God is with me.' said she. He was
   there present in her.' he replied. He is ever present in my soul,' she
   said. Quoth he, But Mary had a solemn pledge of his presence, which
   thou hast not, my daughter.' Quoth she, Since I dispense with outward
   consolations, I am without his outward presence. I would that he were
   ever being bom within my soul.' -- Think twice,' he said, " before
   adventuring that.' -- Peace, let me speak I ' she cried, 'tis by your
   too much admonition that you have hindered me.' He said, Know, did

   the truth move thee, thou hadst not done nor yet forborne because of
   me. I am but creature, as thou knowest. As long as any creature has
   power to give and take thou livest not unto truth. Truth has virtue
   sufficient to raise man to the summit without help from creatures. Thou
   durst not cast the blame on me, for know, whom the truth moves has the
   Holy Ghost to his master, who educates his pupils in the high(!st
   school of all. There we learn more in the twinkling of an eye than all
   the doctors can express.' You speak the truth,' she said.

   The second article of faith is trust in God. He can say he trusts God
   who keeps not overnight so much as a pen'orth of possessions. I say
   more : he keeps nothing at all ; but he who withholds but a pennyworth
   of worldly goods from his even- christian, knowing him to be in need of
   it, is a robber in the sight of God. 1 warn you, l)y Christ who
   suffered so for love of men, allow no want in any man, he being made in
   tlie likeness of Christ for whose sake God created all things ; and
   impair not his condition by withholding from him his father's goods,
   which it behoves him to restore to God.

   Further I declare, who spares a penny for himself to put it by against
   a rainy day, thinking, I may need that for to-morrow, is a murderer
   before God. And I will prove it. For if he trust God he will leave
   himself in God's hands ; if God give him the morrow, he will give him
   also the wherewithal for it. Hence I affirm there be few who have faith
   enough to trust God blindly. Know that the man who sets more store by
   worldly goods than by his powers of knowing and loving God, is justly
   termed a murderer. This I call Christ to witness, who said, When I am
   ascended I will draw all things after me.' In the same way the virtuous
   man takes all things up to God, to their first source. The masters
   teach that creatures were made for man. They prove it from the fact
   that creatures all need each other : cattle need grass, fish water,
   birds the air, and beasts the forest. By the same token all creatures
   come in useful to the good and are carried, one creature in the other,
   by the good soul to God. Lived there a man who trusted God, God would
   do unto him better than ever he could do unto himself.

   Take the third article of faith, that is, knowledge of God. I say, no
   man knows God who knows not himself first. Mark how to know yourselves.
   To know himself a man must be for ever on the watch over himself,
   holding his outer faculties, breaking them in by vigorous training to
   obey the higher powers of his soul. This discipline must be continued
   till he reach a state of conscious- ness so pure that nothing short of
   God can form in it. Then thou dost come acquainted with thyself and
   God.

   The fourth property of faith is love. To be able to say, I love thee,
   Lord,' a man must suffer without why what without why Christ suffered,
   and suffer it gladly without suffering. Though God shall tell him mouth
   to mouth, Thou shalt be lost for ever with the damned,' he only loves
   God all the more, and says, Lord, an thou wilt that I be damned, damned
   I will be, eternally.' Thus he identifies his will with what God wills,
   willing that same in earth and heaven. Of this he deems himself
   unworthy. That man can say, I love thee.'

   We have explained now what faith means. To carry out in practice these
   articles of faith as enumerated from the start entitles us to say, I
   believe in God.'

   By the two roast fishes (one fish is will, the other its fulfilment) we
   understand thorough subjection, the downright death of thy whole nature
   -- the marrow of thy bones, blood in thy veins and whole concomitants
   of natural vigour -- so that albeit having the will to sin, thou hast
   no power to. Doctors debate whether a man can reach the stage at which
   he is incapable of sinning in his body. The best authorities say Yes '
   ; alluding to souls so perfectly disciplined outwardly and inwanily
   that they have no propensity to sin.

   The second fish we take to signify achievement of the virtues ; virtue
   consummated to the pitch where it becomes instinctive ; where virtue is
   our very being ; where our knowledge and love transcend virtue. A man
   at this stage gives pure light.

   Doctors describe four kinds of light. The first is natural, the light
   of natural man apt in affairs, which is less a help ihan a hindrance.
   The second is the light of grace. Whom this en- lightens has his
   natural light put out. It lights him on the road to his salvation,
   preserving him in grace so he follow it closely. The third light
   lightens the angels and man in his primitive innocence. For know, the
   man who with the angels receives all things from God is void of mundane
   things and creaturehood and naked as he was when he came out of God.
   Man can what angels cannot : in this light he can transcend the angels
   and receive all things from the source of divine truth. Then he is
   given divine light, the fourth light, and about this I am dumb. I keep
   that to myself.

   Here the daughter comes to her revered confessor and says,

   Sir, I fear I shall never do it.' -- Why not ? ' said he. Said she,

   I still have all the virtues to cultivate. I ween I never brought one
   single virtue to the pitch required.' Quoth he, Be satisfied to do thy
   best.' -- I have never done my best,' she said, albeit I am well aware
   that I am thrice behoven unto God. My first behoof is to repair my
   faults.'-- None can repair a fault if God

   forgive it not in love,' said he. I wot of that,' she said, but I must
   do my share and live in hopes of grace until I die.'

   Quoth he, What is thy second accusation ? ' She answered,

   That, while fain to be in the joy of our Lord, I have not lived
   accordingly, albeit well aware that to enter there one has to live the
   perfect life in our Lord Jesus Christ.' -- That is so,' he said.

   Tell me, what is thy third behoof ? ' She said, Though there were
   neither hell nor heaven, to follow him for true love all the same, as
   he prevented me : to follow him to the end without a why. 1 know my
   duty but mend not my ways as in duty bound.' -- What more wouldst thou
   do ? ' he asked. 'Fhou hast given up honour and possessions, and kith
   and kin and every comfort thou didst get from creatures.' -- True, sir,
   in letter,' she said, but giving up all God ever created to leave it
   for God's sake is giving up nothing ; it is not mine to give. It is
   God's. Anything in the shape of possessions is God's. Wherefore I ween
   there is still something more for me to leave.' -- What must thou leave
   ? ' he asked.- - Myself,' she answered. If I leave myself wherever 1
   find myself I can say, I have left myself.' -- Thou art right,' he
   cried, ^but I marvel, being so sensitive, thou canst brook the insults
   heaped upon thee.' She said, God knows I feel none.' Quoth he, Does it
   not touch thee that thy friends, spiritual as well as worldly, are so
   distressed on thy account, thinking thee most mistook in thy behaviour
   ? ' -- What is that to me ? ' she said. For well I ween Christ knew,
   when he was sitting in the temple, that Joseph and his mother sought
   him sorrowing. The doctors told Christ : Thy father and thy mother are
   seeking thee. Christ answered : He who is kind to me, the same is my
   father and mother and sister and brother.' -- True,' he said. I
   prithee, though, accept life's necessaries when they are offered thee
   in the name of God.' -- Tell me,' she queried, what are necessaries ?
   Wouldst

   have me specify the bare necessities of life ? ' he asked. Aye,' she
   replied. Bread, water, and a cloak,' he said. These arc bare bodily
   necessities.' Quoth she, Now tell me what is neces- sary ? ' And he
   made answer, To dwell in utter ignominy in Christ who alone lives.' --
   Now God reward you ! ' she exclaimed. Pray God on my behalf to give all
   creatures licence to cry me down and persecute me to their topmost
   bent.' Quoth he, Thou 'It get a plenty in thy vocation. A holy man has
   said, Did God know anyone willing to suffer the sum of human suffering,
   he would give it him to bear that his worth might be so much the
   greater in eternity. God will db this out of pure love to anyone he
   calls to him.' Quoth she, A master says, He alone deserves suffering
   who dearly desires it.' -- True, daughter,' he said. Prithee, an thou
   wilt, remain in these parts and busy thyself among us.' --

   That will I not,' she answered, I must be about my own business. I mean
   to live in exile, anywhere where I am persecuted. For you must know I
   have found more of God in the least desi)iscry than ever I did in the
   sweetness of ereatures.' -- I'll not quarrel with that for it is true,'
   he said. Christ proves it by those words to his disciples. Go ye into
   all places where they shall persecute you.' Quoth she, God bless you
   for it, who have my homage betwixt me and God.' -- Come to me
   wheresoever thou shalt find me,' he said. That will I gladly.'

   St Paul affirms of the holy martyrs and friends of our Lord, They are
   dead.' From this we argue that we have to be dead too. I hold that
   anyone who is not really dead has not the faintest notion of the sacred
   things revealed by God to his beloved. As long as thou still knowest
   wlio thy father and thy mother have been in time, thou art not dead
   with the real death. Further 1 hold : as long as it affects thee that
   no one will shrive tliee nor give thee God's body nor sh(lter thee from
   the world's scorn, as long as it is in thee to be moved by this, know
   that thou art a stranger to the true death. When thou art aware of
   nothing within thee : when, having escaped from earthly species and
   forgot thy honourable estate and all temporal happenings, thou hast
   emtered oblivion so deep that nothing formulates itself in thee and
   thou art sensible of naught save the sheer ascension of Ihy soul, then
   thou canst say that thou art really dead. lie who is dead thus is
   always the same ; nothing affects him. Anent this St John says, Blessed
   are the dead that die in God.' See then, my friends, how^ood it is to
   die in God. We can die gladly il' (iod will live and work in ns while
   we arc idle. We die, 'tis true, but 'tis a gentle death. Folks tell ns
   of the holy life, how they have suffered. To tell the tale of what our
   Lord's friends suffered time would be all too short. T say : they did
   not suffer. The least suspi(*ion of God-eonseious- ness and sufferings
   would be all forgot. This may well liappcn while the soul is in the
   body. I say more ; while yet in the body a soul may reach oblivion of
   its trav^ail not to remember it again. Further 1 hold : to him who
   suffers not for love, to suffer is suffering and is hard to bear. But
   he who suffers for love does not suffer, and this suffering is fruitful
   in God's sight. It follows, friends, that by contriving to die in (iod
   gladly, we go scot-free from suffering. To practise this is to be
   really dead. So to die in God, help us O Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
   Amen.

   token you have never known yourself.' -- True,' he replied, for well I
   ween that if I knew myself as intimately as I ought, I should have
   perfect knowledge of all creatures.' -- You are right,' she said ; but
   a truce to this talk, sir. Hear me, in God's name.' -- Willingly,' he
   said. Say on.'

   The daughter made confession to her revered confessor, as it was now in
   her to do, in a manner to rejoice his heart. Quoth he, Return ere long,
   daughter.' -- Gladly, God willing,' quoth she.

   Going off to his brethren he announces, I have just shriven someone,
   whether woman or angel I misdoubt, nay, I wot not. If woman, her soul
   powers dwell with tlic angels in heaven and her soul has received
   angelic nature. She knows and loves beyond anyone I ever met.' Glory be
   to God,' the brethren cry.

   Seeking his daughter where he knows her to be, in the chapel, namely,
   her confessor earnestly entreats her to converse with him. -- Do you
   not know me yet ? ' she asks, lie answers, No, God knows.' -- Then I
   Avill tell you for love. I am the poor soul you led to God.' And she
   discovers to him her identity. -- Alas, wretch that T am ! ' he cries.
   Shame on me in the sight of God that having spiritual light so long I
   am so unfamiliar with divinity. Prithee, my daugliter, for the love of
   God, recount to me thy life and doings since T last saw thee.' Quoth
   she, That were a deal to tell.' -- Not more than I am fiiin to hear,'
   he said. Know, I have been amazed by what you told me.'

   Ere ^taking up her tale the daughter says to her confessor : You must
   never betray me while I live.' -- I give you my word,' he answered, not
   to divulge thy confession during thy lifetime.' Whereupon she embarks
   on such a wondrous story he marvels any human being could go through so
   much. Quoth she, Sir, still I fall short, I find that I have conquered
   all my heart's desires save only that my faith be not assailed.' -- God
   be praised for making thee,' he cried. Now rest content.' -- Never,'
   she said, while my soul has no abiding place in eternity.' Said he, I
   should be well content to have my soul ascend as thine does.' She said,
   My soul ascends freely, but it makes no stay. To will does not content
   me ; if only I might know the thing to do to establish me permanently
   in eternity ! ' He asked, Is the desire so strong ? ' She answered,
   Aye.' -- Be rid of it,' he said, if thou wouldst be confirmed.' Saying,
   'Tis gladly done,' she sinks into destitution. And God drawing her in
   his divine light she weens that she is one with God. While this
   continues she keeps beating back into herself with an overwhelming
   sense of deity, and keeps ejaculating, I am sure there is no escape for
   me.'

   The confessor visits his daughter frequently, inquiring, Tell

   me, how goes it now with thee ? ' -- 111,' she replies. Heaven and
   earth are too confined for me.' He entreats her to tell him something.
   She says, I have nothing whatever to tell.' -- Just a word, for God's
   sake,' he pleads, and wins it for the asking. She proceeds to reveal to
   him such profound and marvellous things concerning the pure perception
   of divine truth that he exclaims, Thou knowest this is not common
   knowledge, and were I not among those priests who have read it in
   theology, I had not known it either.' -- Much good it is to you,' she
   said. I would you had a lively sense of it.' Said he, I am this much
   alive to it, I feel as certain of it as of my having said the mass
   to-day. Natheless, this lack of actual experience docs trouble me.'

   With the words, Pray God for me,' the daughter returns into her
   solitude to enjoy God's society. Ere long she appears at the door
   again, demanding her confessor, to whom she says, Sir, rejoice with me,
   I am God.' -- Glory be to God ! ' he cries. Retire again into thy
   solitude ; all joy be thine an thou rernainest God.'

   Obedient to her confessor, she goes into the chapel, into a secluded
   corner. There oblivion descended upon her, and she forgot everything
   named and was so far withdrawn from self and everything created that
   she had to be carried from the church and lay till the third day,
   surely accounted for dead. I misdoubt she is dead,' quoth her
   confessor. Know, had there been no confessor they would have buried
   her. They essayed by all manner of means, but whether her soul was in
   her body they could not discover. They said, For sure she is dead.' For
   sure she is not,' said her confessor. On the third day the dau^^ter re-
   turned. Alas, me miserable, am I back ! ' she cried. Her confessor, who
   was already there, addressed her, saying, Permit me to taste divine
   truth in the revelation of thy experience.' She said, God knows, I
   cannot. My exj^ericnce is ineffable.' -- Hast got now all thou wilt ? '
   he asked. She answered, Aye. I am confirmed.'

   Blest and praised be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who showed us
   the way to conquer by grace what he is by nature. It needs a

   the quick of life. We enter the Father in the Son. Humanity receives
   its coup de grace, pierced to the heart by light divine. Therein man
   learns to know himself. Forgot are all God's gifts beknownst to him.
   Thought, word, will, act, lie strewn before him in the reflection of
   the divine light received from the Father. In this divine light the
   soul sees herself less than creature. She finds no place to dwell in.
   She deems herself the vilest thing God ever made. Lucifer is to her so
   meritorious that she ranks under him. Accordingly the masters say,
   Christ's soul and Lucifer's were made in the same light.' Hence the
   soul's grievance and self- condemnation. Christ's soul was the wisest
   soul that ever was : she faced round in the creature and looked towards
   the creator. Wherefore the Father clad her in the divine garment and
   property of his own nature. Hut Lucifer looked away to the defieiency
   and thereby fell, falling eternally. So fall all they that turn from
   God to things corruptible. In this plight the soul now finds herself
   and is consumed within herself, there thinking to remain eternally, for
   it is she who is to blame.

   The best authorities aver that from the very lowest angel of all those
   in heaven, there fell one drop upon Die highest heaven. This started
   the celestial revolutions, each heaven following the course nature laid
   down for carrying round the drop. From it all creatures get their life,
   those that have life in time ; in it all creatures hie them back to
   their first source ; in it the soul becomes aw'are that, so little has
   God become in time, our works must be wrought above time, in eternity.
   Christ taught us this. Ifis works arc all wrought in eternity. Did God
   perform one act outside himself, lie were not (iod. God's works arc
   Avrought so that they remain in him. And our works which are wrought
   thus endure in eternity. Understand, we call viiue that which is in me,
   which none can take from me. --Here the soul is moved to exclaim :
   Alas, that 1 have Avrought so many works outside me ! '

   Concerning nature, the masters speak as folloAvs : Nature and
   naturalness are not identical. The natural state is taken on in time ;
   nature is in itself eternal. This touches the soul. Philo- sophers will
   tell you that thunder is merely the result of opposites. Clouds cannot
   bear being charged with opposites, Avhich crash together ; hence
   lightning and the thunder. So with the wind ; it blows till foreign
   matter is expelled, namely, the rain. Creatures in general will purify
   themselves from incompatiblcs.

   Here the soul realizes that she has often harboured incompatibles. She
   says : Creatures all pointed me to my eternal happiness. They did not
   Lucifer : he fell from God for ever because of the unlikes he assumed.
   God kept me in himself. I had no mind to

   see it, so I can never look for grace.' And there she stops, failing to
   rise beyond herself.

   Now theologians say, God is by nature bound to draw his likes out of
   their selfhood into himself just as the sun will draw up moisture. Then
   the soul, merged in the naked Godhead, is no more to be found than a
   wine-drop in mid-ocean. That soul can no more sin than God can. The man
   is said to be conformed to God. God is his active principle. He has
   real perception. Things are in him without images, for he is one with
   God in whom are all things. In this case it is true to say, all things
   arc in man formless. The masters say : To gauge the soul we must gauge
   her with God, for the ground of God and the ground of the soul are one
   nature.' The part that gives life to the body is the least part of the
   soul. The man who realizes this has fresh and inexhaustible delight.
   What though he walks in time, he dwells in his eternal nature. He
   inhabits the truth. This man is known by five signs. First, he nevaT
   complains. Next, he never makes excuses : when accused, he leaves the
   facts to vindicate him. Thirdly, there is nothing he wants in earth or
   heaven but what God wills himself. Fourthly, he is not moved in time.
   Fifthly, he is never rejoiced : he is joy itself.

   Here the trusty confessor comes seeking his daughter in an unknown
   land, earnestly entreating her to hold converse with him. She says, I
   can talk with you of outward things.' -- 'Twill serve,' quoth he. Tell
   me, what, thinkest thou, made thee most ripe for the eternal truth ? '
   She answered : Leaving myself wherever I found myself. Next, never
   excusing myself from accusations which concerned myself alone. Thirdly,
   whatever my y)ain, wanting still more and compelling myself to bear it
   equably. Fourth, being supple to insignificance, poverty and lack of
   creature comforts. Fifth, never seeing souls sin without rebuke and
   never hearing things against the gospel and the life of Christ without
   I fought them to the death. But know that it has been my habit rather
   to rebuke those persons whose sins I saw were doing them a mortal
   mischief. 1 never did it save purely out of love to God, being moved to
   pity for them. Many an insult they have hurled upon me. Sixth, never
   avoiding occasion of insult : I fled from honour but I stayed for
   shame. Seventh, never looking back when once I knew the way to my
   eternal happiness ; and taking no man's counsel, but plodding straight
   on. Eighth, being never content with present light nor present sight,
   which were as nothing to my certainty. Ninth, never resisting any use
   God chose to put me to. Tenth, rigid discipline, inward and outward.'

   beyond you.' -- But just a hint ; deny me not,' he urged. And she
   responded : At the moment of confirmation there existed in me all the
   works God ever wrought as a little thing inferior to heaven. My abode
   was heaven. I dwelt there with the inmates of the Trinity which to me
   was as familiar as to the householder the house he dwells in, and saw
   the partition between all creatures and God's whole creation : it was
   as plain as the five fingers on my hand.'-- He said, Explain more
   fully.' She replied, I will. I had assembled all my soul-powers. When I
   saw into myself 1 saw God in me and everything God ever made in earth
   and heaven. Let me explain it better. As you know right well, anyone
   wJio faces God in the mirror of truth sees everything depicted in that
   mirror : all things, that is to say. Such was my inner habit before
   confirmation. Do you quite take me ? ' -- It must be so, of course,' he
   said. Is that not thy rule now ? ' She answered, No, I have nothing to
   do with saints nor angels nor crea- tures nor anything created ; it is
   all uniform : not merely nothing created but nothing uttered concerns
   me.' -- Explain,' he said. She said, I will. I am confirmed in the
   naked Godhead, wherein is neither form or image.'-- Art there for good
   ? ' he asked. She answered, Yes.' Quoth he, Daughter, say on, this talk
   delights me.' And she proceeded, As 1 am no creature can be, as
   creature.' -- Explain,' he said. Quoth she, I am as I was before I was
   created : just God and God. No saint nor angel nor choir nor heaven.
   Eight heavens are often spoken of and nine choirs of angels ; there is
   nothing of that where I am. You must know tljat expressions of that
   sort, which conjure up pictures in the mind, merely serve as
   allurements to God. In God there is nothing but God ; no soul gets to
   God until she is God as she was before she was made.'

   He said, You speak the truth, daughter. Now do for God's sake counsel
   me as best thou canst how I may gain possession of this good.'-- I will
   give you sure guidance,' she said. As you are well aware, creatures
   were made from nothing and must return to nothing ere they reach their
   source.' True,' he agreed. Quoth she, Enough said. Tell me now, what is
   nothing ? ' He replied, I know what is nothing and I know what is less
   than nothing. Imperfections, I take it, are nothing to God. So that
   anyone subject to imperfections is less than nothing.' -- How so ? ' --
   He is the servant of imperfection. Nothing is nothing. The servant of
   imperfection is less than nothing.' Quoth she, Pre- cisely. The way
   then to obtain your good is to subordinate yourself to yourself and
   creatures till you can find no more to do towards God's working in
   you.' -- You are right,' he cried. One mastqr says. He who loves God as
   his God, and prays to God as

   his God and is therewith content, is to me as an unbeliever.' --
   Blessed be the master who said that,' quoth she. He knew the truth. For
   you must understand that anyone content with what can be expressed in
   words -God is a word, licaven is a word -- whose soul-powers, love and
   knowledge, insist on nothing further than what can be expressed, is
   aptly styled an unbeliever. It is the lower senses or powers of the
   soul which grasp things uttered. The higher powers are not content with
   tliat : these keep on pressing forward till they strike the source from
   whence the soul flowed forth. The powers of the soul cannot enter her
   source. All nine powers of the soul serve the man of the soul ; they
   draw him out of nether tilings and speed him to his source. When the
   soul stands before her eaus(, superior to things in iier main power,
   her powers remain without. Look you, it is the naked soul, naked of
   things namcable, one in the same, that progresses in the naked Godhead,
   like oil that creeps in cloth : so the soul goes creeping forward,
   flowing on and on so long as God ordains her to give life to the body
   in time. Know, whih* the good man lives on earth his soul is
   progressing in eternity, lienee the good like living.' True daughter,'
   he observed. One master says : Suppose there lay at point to die two
   men ecpially pl(asant in f lic eyes of God, and that both di(d, the one
   before the other but just long enough to give that other time to
   breathe one sigh for God, to east one thought to the least martyr that
   CJod ever led, the lightest word God ever spoke, this would entitle him
   to prcccdenee over the other who died first, while God remains
   eternal.' -- That is so,' she said. Know also, as the good shall rise
   so fall the wicked who arc in sin.' '

   Now prithee, daughter, tell me. We speak of heaven and hell and
   purgatory and read a vast amount about them. We also read that God is
   in everything and every thing in God.' -- And so it is,' she said. --
   Then, for God's sake,' quoth he, acquaint me with the rightful view of
   it.' - Gladly, so far as I can put it into words,' she said. II(;11 is
   nothing but a state or being. Our being here is our eternal being ; we
   are as it were grounded in it. Many people fondly imagine here to have
   crcaturely being and divine being yonder. That is not so. It is a
   popular delusion. Purgatory is a thing assumed, like penance, and comes
   to an end. Look at it like this. Some souls so reverence God and the
   friends of God that God is constrained to have mercy on them, be it
   only at their end that true repentance comes to them in love and
   knowledge and they rise out of themselves and everything created. Then
   true love is their being and did they go on living they would sin no
   more but suffer for true love's sake all our Lord Jesus Christ
   suffered, and his beloved. These rise in grace. But people who

   go hence in their state of creaturehood are in that state eternally
   which is called hell. Likewise, there remains their state to those who
   suffer naught but God to be in them : God is their being and remains
   their being eternally.

   Again, touching the last day, people say, God shall ju^Jge. So he
   shall, but not as they think. Each^n^an is his own judge in this sense
   : the state he then appears in he is in eternally. People frequently
   assert : The body shall rise with the soul. So it shall. But not as
   they think. The being of the body and the being of the soul go to form
   one being. Those souls who all their days have spent their time in God
   till God has come to be their being, to them God stays their being,
   body and soul eternally. Not so the wicked who have squandered their
   time on creatures ; what their state is it continues to be, and this
   eternal hq^sing from God and from his friends is called hell. Vet bear
   in mind that these same persons get their being from (iod or they would
   not be at all. So they are in God and Ciod is in them. You see, they
   have the being of God. Take it like this. They ani in God as 'tvvcrc a
   man with his life forfeit to some righteous lord whose honour he has
   stolen and whose friends, and plotted frequently against his life ; and
   now his lord, who showed him only kindness in liopcs of his reform, is
   vexed to find that he declines to mend. Holding him in the grip of
   justice, his lord forbears to kill. He punishes the outrage on himself.
   First, bound hand and foot, the man is cast into the lowest donjon
   among toads and reptiles and the foul water which is wont to lie in
   deepest donjon-keeps. Fetched up from thence, he is disgraced before
   the world, that they may see his opCTi shame and he their joy. So much
   the more his torment. Insult after insult do they heap upon him, shame
   unthinkable ; he is ever cast back into his donjon, ever in dread of
   execution. Even so it is permissible to say that man is at the court,
   for the donjon is the royal court as much as the hall is where the king
   stays with his friends ; but conditions, you sec, are different. Though
   not with that celestial race we spoke of. Know that grief endures
   eternally. I marvel that anyone who hears these words should dare to
   sin. Purgatory is so grievous in itself that anyone who knows the
   rights of it would stay no time in sin. Purgatory you must know is
   temporal and notional. A soul which leaves the body, as I said, in
   faith and love and will to do all for God's sake and eschew sin for
   God, that soul is in dire distress, unable to do anything but wait till
   God shall deign to take compassion on her. And though this happen not
   till doomsday, the hope is her life. Doomsday past, this is over. But
   souls in the divine condition are not affected in this sense : on
   quitting the body such a soul remains in a condition of divinity
   determined by her knowledge

   and love of God, and after the day of judgment the being of the body
   and the being of the soul arc one being in the divine actuality.
   According to the most reliable authorities, statements of theirs
   regarding creatures arc not to be construed to mean that John went body
   and soul to lieaven ; no more did others of our Lord's friends cither,
   of whom report says they are body and soul in God, transcending time in
   eternity. It is not possible. In God can be nothing but God, not
   nioutli nor nose nor hand nor foot nor any creature pertaining to the
   body. So tlicy cannot be held to have got there in the body. IVi' may
   reasonably suppose that when the time came for John to go, God caused
   to befall him what was due to happen on the day of judgment. Ih^ did
   this for true love's sake, be(*ause he was so pure. The being of his
   soul, taking with it, God helping, the being of his body, was drawn
   u]). We juay take it that his body, which was destined to perisli Iutc
   on earth, was disintegrated in the air, so that Mien* enter(d into God
   only the being of the body, which would liave aecoinpanied tlu; soul at
   the last day. Thus it befell Mary and all of whom it is related that
   they attained to (iod in the body.'

   'Tis well argued,' he said. Hut you must kno\v the cpiestion is in hot
   dispute among the theologians.' Said she, I will give you the key to
   its solution. Pass to our Lord Jesus Christ and see what happened at
   his ascension. He was at meat when he ascended. As you well know, the
   food was lost in transit, with everything adventitious that Christ had
   taken on, wliicdi all remained in time. He eould only take with him
   into the Father that which came out of the Father. Tlu being of
   C}irif?^'s soul took with it the being of the noble manhood of our Lord
   .Tesus Christ in its divine actuality. The ])ersons subsist in th(
   Father as one with the Father. Fven so are all thost* in th( Father who
   eoncpier Ijy grace what Christ has by nature : not that they take with
   them the life of the body when they go hence ; that waits till
   doomsday. The being of the body reverts to the b(ing of the soul only
   when all things have perished, according to the vulgar teaching. You
   doubtless know that whom (iod deigns to favour he treats as he treated
   St John.' Quoth he, I wot that well. If I did as St Dominic, I should
   be as St Dominic. St Dominic sold his book and all he possessed and
   gave to the poor for God's sake. We do not this, daughter, nor do we
   ])ractise numerous other virtues of St Dominie. We are as we are
   through pretending a priesthood we do not possess. St Francis was a
   simple soul wherefor God greatly favoured him. He approached Ckxl in
   perfect simplicity of life and so grew familiar with God. Now in those
   parts there was a priest who sorely hated a profane to be so intimate
   with God. Going to visit him, he said, " What

   shall we make of this, brother ? The scriptures say we must rebujce men
   for their sins." -- " Assuredly," said St Francis. -- " But," said the
   priest, " did I rebuke a man, he might repay me twofold." -- "How
   should he ? " said St Francis. "I can rede you the scriptures better
   than that : we are to cultivate the true and perfect life, within and
   without, till we become a living rebuke to all mankind." - " True,
   brother," said the priest ashamed. -- ^Know that to do as St Francis is
   to become as St Francis. Further, I hold : when wc depart this life,
   grace departs from us. And again : to be less than St John is to be
   more than St John.' -- Thank God, you know it,' she exclaimed. He said,
   I have known it lor long, and I ween it is true, though 1 do not live
   it.' -- That I rue,' she said.

   Quoth she, You have told me of nine heavens. Now tell me what 1 ask.
   Advise me what sort of life to lead, for you know my life better than
   anyone.'-- Indeed 1 will,' said he, and gladly. Eat when thou art
   hungry, drink when thou art thirsty, wear fine linen, sleep and take
   thine ease ; gratify thy tastes in meats and drinks and, for a season,
   study thyself, live for thyself alone. An thou shouldst see God's whole
   creation swallowed up before thine eyes, avert it not with so much as
   an Ave Maria, but summon all creatures at will to do thy bidding to the
   glory of God. Wear delicate, beautiful raiment, and, abiding in one
   place, carry all things up to God. Dost thou choose to enjoy creatures,
   it is seemly so to do, seeing that any creature thou enjoyest thou dost
   render to its cause. Thou wilt know full well that everything thou
   ejijoyest is in God to God's glory.' She said, ' I know right well that
   all you say is true but you must understand I never shall want anything
   except to be a beggar till I die.' -- Thou art mistook,' he said. --
   Then mistaken I will remain,' said she. I choose poverty and exile ;
   that none can take from me.' -- On my soul, thou art false to God,' he
   cried. -- How so ? ' she asked. Just pleasing thyself,' he answered.
   Quotli she, God knows I am but keeping on the lines that led me to
   eternal happiness. The natural error of those lines in time and in
   eternity shall be mine too in eternity and time. I will not deviate
   from the rule of our Lord Jesus Christ.' He said, Thou shouldst know
   that. God prosper thee.' Then she : Believe me, I do take more ease ;
   my discipline is not so strict as heretofore. If only I might forward
   on their way good souls approaching their eternal happiness but lacking
   certainty, that I fain Would do ; I would fain succour the whole world
   from sin for God's sake. Since our Lord Jesus Christ made use of all
   his faculties up to his death, 'tis meet I should do likewise. My outer

   manhood of our Lord Jesus Christ

   I discerned good and evil.'

   Tell me, daughter,' he said, doctors declare that in heaven a thousand
   angels can stand on the point of a needle. Now rede me the meaning of
   this ? ' She answered, The doctors arc right. You can see it in this
   way. The soul that enters into (iod owns neither time nor space nor
   anything nameable to be expressed in words. Hut it stands to reason, if
   you consider it, that the space occupied by any soul is vastly greater
   than heaven and earth and God's entire creation. I say more : God might
   make heavens and earths galore yet these, together with the
   multiplicity of creatures he has already made, would be of less extent
   than a single needle-tip compared with the standpoint of a soul atoned
   in God.' -- So the daughter went on, till her talk turning upon God,
   she waxed most clocpient, the fathe r urging her at intervals ; Say on,
   daughter.' She inii)arted to him so much concerning the immen- sity of
   God, the might of God and the providence of God, that he took leave of
   his outer senses and they had to carry him into a neighbouring cell
   where he lay for long ere coming to himself again. Returning to
   himself, he desired his daughter to come ^o him. Admitted to his
   presence, his daughter impiired, How is it now with you ? Excellently
   well,' he answered. God be praised for sending thee to a man. Thou
   didst show me the way to my eternal happiness, and I have been deep in
   divine contemplation where there was given me the realization of all I
   have heard from thy lips. Daughter 1 adjure thee, by thy love to God,

   SIGNS OF THE TRUE GROUND

   According to one master, many people arrive at specific under-
   standing, at formal, notional knowledge, but there are few who get
   beyond the science and the theory ; yet one man whose mind is free from
   notions and from forms is more dear to God than the hundred thousand
   who have the habit of discursive reason. God cannot enter in and do his
   work in them owing to the restlessness of their imagination. If they
   were free from pictures they could be caught and carried up beyond all
   rational concepts, as St Diony- sius says, and also have the super-
   rational light of faith at its starting-point, where God finds his rest
   and peace to dwell and work in as he will and when he will and what he
   will. God is unhindered in his work in these so he can do in them his
   most precious work of all, working them up in faith into himself. These
   people no one can make out ; their life is an enigma, and their ways,
   to all who do not live the same. To this truth and to this blessed
   life, to this high and perfect consummation no one can attain except in
   abstract knowledge and pure understanding.

   Many a lofty intellect, angels not excepting (for in life and nature an
   angel is nothing but pure mind), has erred and lapsed eternalty from
   the eternal truth and this may happen also to those who, like the
   angels, preserve their idiosyncrasy and find satis- faction in the
   exercise of their own intelligence. Hence the masters urge, and the
   saints as well, the use and the necessity of careful observation and
   close scrutiny to test the light which flashes in, the light of
   understanding and of vision which man has here in time, lest he be the
   subject of hallucination. If you would know and recognise the really
   sane and genuine seers of God, whom nothing can deceive nor misinform,
   they can be detected by four and twenty signs.

   The first sign is told us by the chief exponent of knowledge and wisdom
   and transcendental understanding, who is himself the truth, our Lord
   Jesus Christ. He says, Thereby ye shall know that ye are my disciples,
   if ye love one another and keep my commandment. What is my commandment
   ? That ye love one another I have loved you,' as though to say, yp may
   be my disciples in knowledge and in wisdom and high undemanding but
   without true love it shall avail you little if anything at all.

   Balaam was so clever he understood what God for many hundred years had

   pure intellect and to this day knows much. He has the more hell pain
   and all because he failed to cleave with love and faith to what he
   knew. -- The second sign is selflessness : they empty themselves out of

   THE BIRTH OF THE ETERNAL WORD IN THE SOUL

   Now we will speak of the eoming of our Lord Jesus Christ as he is born
   to-day at this holy season of the Virgin Mary his blessed mother and
   again as he is born of grace in the perfect soul for that is the whole
   end of Christ's work on earth ,* and we shall ask nine questions from
   which any pious man may tell whether the eternal Word is born in him or
   no.

   The first question is, how to prepare for the interior speaking of the
   eternal Word ? -- Several things are needed. First, purity of life and
   mind. Next, the peace and freedom of a still and silent heart which is
   speaking to no creature and is spoken to by none, whether of the senses
   or the spirit. And now for a hard saying which few will understand :
   while the soul is speaking her own word and her noble word, the Father
   cannot speak his Word in her ; while the soul is begetting her own son,
   the noblest work of her own understanding, the Father is not able to
   beget his Soi^ in her to her best advantage. Thirdly, the soul must
   forsake herself in order to conceive the eternal Word like St Paul and
   Mary, God's mother, in whom the eternal Word was uttered perfectly. The
   mind must die to itself, disowning itself and becoming God's own.
   Fourthly, the mind must lift up its intellect and see, for seeing is
   the lustiest work and noblest of which the soul is capable. Mark how
   eagerly he comes ; he says, Behold I stand at the door and knock ! '
   Fifthly, it behoves us greatly to desire this birth, for desire is the
   root of all virtue and goodness.

   The second question is, what is God's birth in the soul ? God's birth
   in the soul is nothing else than a special divine motion in a special
   heavenly mode whereby God wrests the spirit from the tumult of
   creaturely unrest into his motionless unity where God can communicate
   himself to the spul in his divinity. There man enjoys his Word in the
   Father jn its first discriminate emanation and with the Father as
   ^sential Person and in the Holy Ghost as the limit set to thdr eternal
   bliss, and it is in the soul as the reflection of her intellectual
   proto- ^ See also Greith, pp. 102, 103.

   type and in all creatures as the preserver of their being. For God
   speaks his Word in every creature, but no creature is aware of it save
   rational creatures only. The soul is reborn into God when she turns to
   God and pursues his eternal Word right into his paternal heart where
   God makes naked revelation of his birth to the soul. The soul falls
   upon this birth which is revealed to her, with love and knowledge. As
   the Father comes into the soul in his Word so in the Word the soul is
   returned into the Father. That we may eternally play this game in God,
   God help us.

   The third question is, can any man be so well prepared that God is
   obliged to speak his eternal Word in him ? We know that God must fulfil
   two obligations. First, when God is pledged and bound to the soul by
   the bonds of mutual love. Then God never fails the soul provided she is
   ready ; he is obliged of mutual necessity to give himself to her, as
   Christ said to Zaceheus, This day I must abide with thee in thine
   house.' There is another word that must be spoken. Every good thing
   communicates itself to whatever is able to receive it ; it would
   therefore be contrary to God's goodness to withhold himself from us if
   we can take him in. And there is a third compulsory utterance, that of
   some cause or force which is inadmissible in God. Theologians tell us
   that works wrought by the soul with God and in his grace God rewards or
   not just as he chooses, for such works are creature and finite and
   befall in time. They are too insignificant and vile to deserve reward
   from God at all. But the work God docs in us without our co-operation,
   where the soul's work fails and God's activity prevails, in that the
   soul is merely passive and God is the only o^e who works. Works wrought
   thus by God in the soul it is his bounden duty to requite with his own
   self, for these works are so divine, so eternal, so immense and so
   nearly touch God's honour, he has no guerdon for them but himself.
   These souls are the noblest product of this life and it is of them St
   John declares, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.' The outward
   world is dead to them as they arc also to the world. Their outward man
   can no more clash with their inner man than the dead can with the
   living and this is due to the gift of God and interior prayer and
   profound humility. Which God grant us.

   The fourth question is, what particular place or power of the soul the
   eternal Word is born in ? The philosophers and saints have many fine
   sayings about this. Some say, in the intellect for that is most like
   God. Some say, in the will for that is the free power of the soul. A
   third school teaches, in the soul -spark because that is most nigh to
   God. A fourth, in the arcanum of the mind for it is there that God is
   most at home. A fifth school says (and it is with this one that I
   hold), that it is born in the

   innermost being of the soul and all her powers are made aware of it in
   a divine savour, each power in its own mode but intellect is the
   highest power of the soul and therewith the soul grasps the divine
   good. Free will is the power of relishing the divine good which
   intellect makes known to it. The spark of the soul is the light of
   God's reflection, which is always looking back to God. The arcanum of
   the mind is the sum-total, as it were, of all the divine good and
   divine gifts in the innermost essence of the soul, which is as a
   bottomless well of divine goodness. Which may God grant us.

   The fifth question is, what part does the mind play in this birth ? It
   enters a condition of complete passivity leaving God to work his will
   in perfect liberty. Perhaps it may be asked, Is the mind aware that God
   is working in it ? I answer : Virtue, all good works wrought by God in
   man, fervour and devotion for example, a man will be aware of, for with
   works of this kind there is very often the evidence of the senses. But
   when the divine good over- whelms with its riches the appetitive
   faculty and the light of God raises the intellect to a higher power,
   coercing or carrying the mind into his divine countenance, then the
   mind pays no more attention to creatures : she is standing face to face
   with the highest truth. Which may God give us.

   The sixth question is, what part is played by the body in this ? It is
   resting peacefully, incapable of movement in any of its members, for
   the superior powers have fetched home the lower, and the essence of the
   soul has absorbed her higher powers so all is at a stand-still while
   the eternal Word is being born, in the mind and in the body. So help us
   God.

   The seventh question is, can no power of the soul remain at work while
   the eternal Word is being supernaturally born in this way in the soul ?
   The answer is this. The soul has two kinds of powers, and of these the
   outward senses of the body arc all at rest and also the powers which
   move the body have been fetched in so that none of her powers remain
   active, but the soul is merely the motionless form of the body. As the
   prophet says, When all things were in mid-silence God spake his silent
   Word into my soul.' Motionless peace descends upon the body and the
   mind wherein the eternal birth is to be supernaturally conceived. To
   attain to this we must be like the shepherds watching in the night
   wherein Christ was born. So must a man keep watch and ward over his own
   mind, driving his intelligence up into the heights, to those eternal
   laws ordained by God for lost and saved.^ Let us beseech him daily to
   carry out in us his eternal laws and rules. For

   priests and rcli^rious the seven liours are ordained that they may
   thank God for his death and pray him to accomplish his eternal rules
   and laws in us. And you who know this truth better than others do
   should let your minds dwell more upon this birth than other people can
   who arc ignorant about it. God help us to the truth.

   The eighth question is, what fruits or gifts are granted to the soul in
   whom the eternal Word is spoken ? Him four things befall. The first is
   that he is united with God. Next, he becomes God's Son by grace.
   Thirdly, he is made God's heir. Fourtlily, he is loosed from bondage ;
   as St Paul, naming all four perfections, says, In Christ is neither
   male nor female, neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free ; but ye
   are all one in Christ and arc sons of God. And if sons of God then
   heirs of God.' May we being loosed from bondage be God's sons, so help
   us God.

   ^ Now, taking as my text, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased,' I will set forth the things a man must have in order to be
   God's Son by grace. First, he must have perfect self- control, as the
   Lord Christ says, I have power to lay down my soul and take it up
   again.' Meaning, he is not cast down by suffering and adversity nor
   puffed up by worldly happiness and prosperity. Secondly, he must have
   his mind ever charged with divine ideas and godly sayings. Thirdly, he
   must have the highest good ever present to his mind so far as his
   nature will allow. Fourthly, he must steadfastly abide therein so far
   as his nature can endure it. Fifthly, if he go out into creatures for
   the needs of life he must not tarry there longer than is neqjssary.
   Sixthly, what his mind conceives of from within of divine mystery or
   truth he must protect from nature as a rich man guards his treasure
   from robbers and from thieves. In the seventh place, he must make no
   attempt to express these things in words until the time is ripe, that
   is, until he puts them into practice. Eighth, he must know well enough
   and consider fit any person he reveals these secrets to : the fool
   confides in all the world but the wise in few. Ninthly, he must be
   gracious alike to yea and nay. Tenth, he must be indifferent about what
   God has done to him and is going to do. [Eleventh, it must not concern
   him what God has done or is to do.] Twelfth, he must behave impartially
   to those whom God has chosen or not chosen [to those to whom his grace
   has or has not been given] ; and all these things he must offer up to
   the glory of God, obeying the divine command that what pleases God
   shall please him also and saying with Christ, Father,

   thy will not mine be done.' These twelve articles, with the pre- ceding
   four, set forth the highest life that can be led in time. Of him who
   has these things may the Father say, This is my beloved Son in whom I
   am well pleased ; hear ye him.' And he who has them not but defaults
   therein, his defects are what St Augustine calls spiritual sins.

   The ninth question is, how to recognise these people in whom the
   eternal Word is born ghostly and gratuitously ? I answer, by the
   following signs. The first is that these people are dead to flesh and
   blood and to all natural appetites, as St Paul says, Since the eternal
   Word was born in me I no longer live to flesh and blood.' Secondly the
   pleasures of the body [the triumphs of the world], are like sour breath
   unto their soul. As St Gregory declares, Worldly joys and glories are
   nothing but untowardness. Thirdly, these people arc for ever listening
   for God's voice in them, David says, I will hearken to what God the
   Lord shall say within me.' Fourthly, they are not perturbed by the
   uncertainty of things : nothing vexes or depresses them, as Christ said
   to his disciples, In your patience possess ye your souls.' Fifthly,
   these people turn everything to good account so nothing can corrupt
   them, but they are ever pure in heart ; as St Paul says, All things
   work together for good to them that love God.' Sixthly, they have no
   desire to vie with anyone ; they live in the world as though there was
   no one but themselves and God. Wherefore their heavenly Father begets
   his Son in them unceasingly and this birth is for all who give their
   mind thereto.

   Th^. Lord Christ calls himself the flower of the field, for this is
   common property. Even so this birth is the common property of all those
   who are ready and diligently longing to receive it. May we thus desire
   this birth and eternally enjoy it. So help us God. Amen.

   DETACHMENT ^

   I have read many writings of heathen philosophers and sages, of the old
   covenant and of the new, and have sought earnestly and with all
   diligence which is the best and highest virtue whereby a man may knit
   himself most narrowly to God and wherein he is most like to his
   exemplar, as he was in God, wherein was no differ- ence between himself
   and God, ere God created creature. And having approfounded all these
   scriptures to the best of my ability, I find it is none othe r t han
   absolute detachment from all creatures.

   * See also Spamor, B. 4.

   As our Lord said to Martha, unum est necessarium,^ which is as good as
   saying, He who would be serene and pure needs but one thing,
   detachmejit.

   Our (ioctors sing love's praises, as did St Paul, who said, What-
   soever things I do and have not charity I am nothing.' But I
   cx^j^etachj^^ any love. First, because at best love

   constrains me to love God. Now it is far better my constraining God to
   me than for me to be constrained to God. My eternal ^ happiness depends
   on God and me becoming one ; but God is apter to adapt himself to me
   and can easier communicate with ^me than I can communicate with God.
   Detachment forces God to ! come to me, and this is shown as follows.
   Everything is fain to be in its own natural state. But God's own
   natural state is unity and purity and these conic from de^chmeixt.
   Hence God is bound to give himself to a heart detached. -- Secondly, I
   rank detachment above love because love constrains me to suffer all
   things for God's sake : detachment constrains me to admit nothing but
   God. Now j it is far better to tolerate nothing but God than to suffer
   all things 1 for God's sake. For in suffering one has regard to
   creatures, whence the suffering conics, but detachment is immjjlie.
   from creature. Further, that detachment admits of none biit God I
   demonstrate in this wise : anything received must be received in aught.
   But detachment is so nearly naught that there is nothing rare enough to
   stay in this detachment, except God. He is so simple, so ethereal, that
   he can sojourn in the solitary heart. Detachment then admits of God
   alone. That which is received is received and grasped by its receiver
   according to the mode of the receiver ; and so anything conceived is
   known and und^stood according to the mind of him who understands and
   not according to its own innate conceivability.

   And humility the masters laud beyond most other virtues. I / rank
   detachment before any meekness and for the following ; reasons.
   Meekness can be without detachment, but complete detachment is
   impossible without humility. Perfect humility is a matter of
   self-naughting ; but detachment so narrowly approxi- mates to naught
   that no room remains for aught betwixt zero and absolute detachment.
   Wherefore without humility is no complete detachment. Withal two
   virtues are always better than one. -- Another reason w'^hy I put
   detachment higher than humility is this : humility means abasing self
   before all creatures and in that same abasement one goes out of oneself
   to creatures. But detach- ment abideth in itself. Now no going out
   however excellent, but staying in is better still. As the prophet hath
   it, omnis gloria filice regis ab intusy" the king's daughter is all
   glorious mthin. Perfect detachment is without regard, without either
   lowliness or

   loftiness to creatures : it has no mind to be below nor yet to be above
   ; it is minded to be master of itself, loving none and hating none,
   having neither likeness nor urilikeness, neither this nor that, to any
   creature ; the only thing it fain would be is same^ But to be either
   this or that it does not want at all. He who is this or ,that is aught
   ; but detachment is altogether naught. It leaves i -things unmolested.

   Here someone may object. But surely in our Lady all the virtues
   flourished in perfection and among them absolute detachment. Now
   granting that detachment is better than humility, why did our Lady
   glory in her lowliness instead of her detachment, saying, quia respexit
   dominus humilitatem ancillce sua- ' : He regarded the lowliness of his
   handmaiden ' ?

   I answer that, in God there is detachment and humility as well, so far
   as virtues can be attributed to God. Know, it was his loving meekness
   that made God stoop to enter human nature while it remained within
   itself as motionless, what time he was made man, as it was while he
   created the heavens and the earth, as I shall show you later. And
   seeing that our Lord when he ' chose to be made man did persist in his
   motionless detachment, by that same token did our Lady know that he
   expected her to do the same, albeit for the nonce he had regard
   expressly to her lowliness and not to her detachment. So remaining
   unmoved in her detach- ment she yet gloried in her lowliness and not in
   her detachment. Had she but once remembered her detachment to say, He
   regarded my detachment,' her detachment would by that have been
   disturbed and would not have been absolute and perfect since a going
   forth has t^Jien place. Any event, however insignificant, will always
   cause some troubling of detachment. There you have the explana- tion of
   our Lady's glorying in her lowliness instead of her detach- ment. Quoth
   the prophet, audiani, quid loquatur in me dominus deus,^ I will be
   still and listen to what my Lord and my God may be saying within me,'
   as though to say, if God would parley with me then he must come in for
   I will not go out. It is Boethius who exclaims, Yc men, why do ye look
   without for that which is within you ? '

   I prize detachment more than mercy too, for mercy means naught else but
   a man's going forth of self by reason of his fellow- creatures* lack,

   so wholly free from fault, so unitiye to Goci as is detach men t.

   It was Avicenna the philosopher who said, The mind detached ; is of
   such nobility that what it sees is true, what it desires befalls and
   its behests must be obeyed.' For you must know that jwhen

   the free mind is quite detached it constrains God to itself and could
   it femairi formless arid free from adventitiousness it would take on
   the nature of God. But God grants this to none beside himself ; so God
   can do no more for the solitary soul than make it a present of himself.
   The man who is in absolute detachment is rapt away ;jinto eternity
   where nothing temporal affects him nor is he in the ( least aware of
   any mortal thing ; he has the world well dead, he having no relish for
   aught earthly. St Paul meant this when he declared, I live and yet not
   I : Christ liveth in me.'

   Perad venture thou will say, ~ What then is detachment that it should
   be so noble in itself ? -- True detachment means a mind as little moved
   by what befalls, by joy and sorrow, honour and dis- grace, as a broad
   mountain by a gentle breeze. * Such motionless detachment inakes a man
   superlatively Godlike. For that God is GodT is due to his motionless
   detachment, and it is from his detach- ^ ment that he gets his purity
   and his simplicity and his immuta- ' bility. If then a man is going to
   be like God, so far as any creature can resemble God, it will be by
   detachment. This leads to purity and from purity to simplicity and from
   simplicity to immova- bility ; and it is these three which constitute
   the likeness between man and God, which likeness is in grace, for it is
   grace which draws a man away from mortal things and purges him from
   things corruptible. I would have you know that to be empty of creatures
   '\ is to be full of God and to be full of creatures is to be empty of ?
   God.

   Now it must be remembered that in this immutable detachment God has
   stood for aye and does still stand. Know also, that when God created
   the heavens and the earth he might not ha^e been making anything at all
   for all that it affected his deta^ment. Nay, I say more : prayers and
   good works wrought by a man in time affect no more the diviiie
   detachment than if no prayers nor virtuous Avorks had come to pass in
   time ; nor is God any kindlier disposed towards that wight than if his
   prayers and deeds had all V&gt;een left undone. Further I declare, when
   the Son in his Godhead was pleased to be made man and was and suffered
   martyrdom, God's motionless detachment was no more disturbed than if he
   had never been made man.

   Haply thou wilt say, I gather then that prayers and virtuous deeds are
   all in vain ; God takes too little interest in them to be affected by
   them. And yet they say God likes to be entreated upon all occasions.

   .Now mark, and realize if possible, that in his first eternal glance
   (if a first glance may be assumed), God saw all things as they would
   happen and he saw in that same glance both when and how he would make
   creatures. He saw the humblest prayer that

   would be offered, the least good deed that anyone would do and saw
   withal which prayers and which devotions he would hear. He saw that
   to-morrow thou shalt call upon him earnestly, urgently entreating him ;
   and not for the first time to-morrow will God grant thy supplication
   and thy prayer : he has granted it already in his eternity ere ever
   thou becamest man. Suppose thy prayer is foolish or lacking
   earnestness, God will deny it thee not then, he has denied it thee
   already in his eternity. Thus God, who has seen everything in that
   first eternal glance, in no wise acts from any why at all, for
   everything is a foregone conclusion.

   And though God docs stay all the while in motionless detachment yet are
   men's prayers and virtuous works not all in vain, he who does well
   being well rewarded. As Philippiis says, God creator holds all things
   in the course and order he has given them from the beginning.' With him
   nothing is past and nothing future, who has loved all his saints even
   as he foresaw them ere ever the world became. Yet when there come to
   pass in time the things he speculated in eternity then people think
   that God has changed his mind, though whether he be wrathful or
   benignant it is wc who change and he remains the same ; just as the
   sunshine hurts weak eyes and benefits the strong ones what time the
   light itself remains unchanged. God does not see in time nor is his
   outlook subject to renewal. Isodorus argues in this sense in his book
   on the Arch-Good. lie says, People arc always asking what God did
   before he created the heavens and the earth and whence there came to
   God the new will to make creatures ? His answer is that no new will at
   all arose in God ; for what though creature was not in itself as it is
   now yet it was from eternity in God and in his mmd. God did not make
   the heavens and the earth as we should say, man -fashion, Let them be !
   ' but creatures arc all spoken in his eternal Word. Moses said to God,
   Lord, if Pharaoh ask me who thou art, what am I to say ? ' And God
   replied, Say, He-who-is hath sent me.' Or in other words, He who is
   unchanging in himself, he it is hath sent me.

   Here someone may object. But was Christ in motionless detach- ment when
   he cried, My soul is sorrowful even unto death ! ' Or Mary when she
   stood beneath his cross ? yet much is said about her lamentations. How
   is all this compatible with motion- less detachment ? -- Know then,
   that according to philosophers there are in everyone two men : one, the
   outward man, is his objective nature ; this man is served by the five
   senses, albeit he is energised by the power of the soul. The other one,
   the inner man, is man's subjective nature. Now I would have you know
   that the Godly-minded man employs his soul-powers in his outward man no
   more than his five senses really need it ; and his interior man

   only has recourse to the five senses so far as it is guide and keeper
   to these five senses and can stop them being put to bestial uses as
   they so often are by those who live according to the baser appetites,
   as do the mindless beasts, and who deserve the name of beast rather
   than that of man. What surplus energy she has beyond what she expends
   on her five senses the soul bestows upon her inner man, and supposing
   he has toward some right high endeavour she will call in all the powers
   she has loaned to the five senses and then the man is said to be
   senseless and rapt away, his object being either some unintelligible
   form or some formless intelligible. Remember, God requires every
   spiritual man to love him with all the powers of his soul. Thou shalt
   love the I^ord thy God with all thy heart,' he says. Some squander all
   their soul-powers on their outward man. Namely, those whose thoughts
   and feelings hinge on temporal goods, all unwitting of an inner man.
   And even as the virtuous man will now and then deprive his outward self
   of all the powers of the soul what time he is embarking on some high
   adventure, so bestial man will rob his inner self of all its
   soul-powers to expend them on his outer man. Withal it must be realized
   that the outward man is able to be active and leave the inward man
   entirely passive and unmoved. Now in Christ too existed an outward and
   an inward man and also in our Lady, and what Christ and our Lady said
   concerning outward things was prompted by their outward man, the inner
   man remaining in motionless detachment. So was it when Christ said, My
   soul is sorrowful unto death.' And despite her lamentations and various
   things she said. Our Lady, in her inner man, stood all the while in
   motionless detachment. Take an illustration. The d^r goes to and fro
   upon its hinges. Now the projecting door I liken to the outwafd^man and
   the hinge I liken to the inner man. As it shuts and opens the door
   swings to and fro while the hinge remains unmoved in the same place
   without undergoing any change. And likewise here.

   What then, I ask, is the object of absolute detachment ? I answer, that
   the object of absolute detachment is neither this nor that. It is
   absolu^ v nothing, for it is the culminating point where God can do
   preciscIylS^hc will.^ God cannot have his way in every Tteaft, for
   though God is alriugnty yet he cannot work except where he finds
   readiness or makes it. I add, or makes it, by reason of St Paul in whom
   he found no readiness but whom he did make ready by infusion of his
   grace ; wherefore I affirm, God works according to the aptitude^ he
   %ds. He works differently in man and in a stone, and for this we have a
   natural analogy. If you heat a baker's oven and place in it the dough,
   some made of barley, some of oats and some of wheat and some of rye,
   then albeit in

   the oven the heat is all the same it does not tell alike on all the
   doughs, but one yields a fine bread, another one more coarse and a
   third a coarser still. The heat is not to blame : it is the material
   which differs. Nor does God tell alike on every heart but accord- ing
   to the readiness and the capacity he finds. In any heart containing
   this or that there is something to hinder God's highest operation. For
   a hear^toj^i^perfectly r^a^it^feas to be perfectly empty, this
   T5?mg[lts^ndijdon p To take

   anotlier common illustration. Suppose I want to write on a white
   tablet, then anything already written there, however excellent it be,
   will interfere and hinder me from writing ; ere I can write I must
   erase completely whatever is already on the tablet which is never
   better fitted for me to write upon than when there is nothing there at
   all. And so for God to write his very best within , my heart everything
   dubbed this or that must be ousted from my j heart leaving it quite
   without attachment. God is free to work his sovran will when the object
   of this solitary heart is neither this nor that.

   Then again I ask, What is the prayer of the solitary heart ? I answer,
   that detachment and emptiness cannot pray at all, for whoso prays
   desires of God somcthirig : something added to him or something taken
   from him. Ilut the heart detached has no j desire for anything nor has
   it anything to be delivered from. So it has no prayers at all ; its
   only prayer consists in being uniform with God. In this sense we may
   take St Dionysius' comment on the saying of St Paul, Many there be that
   run but one receiveth the prize.' All the powers of the soul competing
   for the crown which^alls to the essence alone. According to Dionysius
   this running is none other than the flight from creature to union with
   uncreated nature. Attaining this the soul loses her name ; God absorbs
   her in himself so that as self she comes to naught, just as the
   sunlight swallows up the dawn and naughts it. To this pass nothing
   brings the soul but absolute detachment. And here it is germane to
   quote St Augustine's dictum : The soul has a private door into divine
   nature at the point where for her things all come to naught.' This door
   on earth is none other than absolute detachment. At the height of her
   detachment she is ignorant with knowing, loveless with loving, 4a^k

   Here too we might cite a master's word§*^^ iessed are the spiritual
   poor who have abandoned unto God all things as he possessed them when
   we existed not. This none can do but a heart wholly without attachment.

   That God would sooner be in a solitary heart than any other, I argue in
   this fashion. Starting from thy question. What does God seek in all
   things ? I answer in his words out of the Book of

   Wisdom, In alj^thhiigs I seek rest.' Now there is nowhere perfect rest
   save in a heart detached. Ergo, God is happier there than in any other
   thing or virtue. Know that the more we are disposed to receive the
   inflowing God, the more happy we shall be ; perfect receptivity gives
   perfect felicity. Now one makes oneself re'ceptfvc to the influence of
   God only by dint of uniformity with God ; as a man's uniformity with
   God so is his sense of the inflow of God. Uniformity comes of
   subjection to God, and the more one is subject to creature the less one
   is uniform with God. But the heart which is (juite detached and all
   devoid of creatures, being utterly subject to God and uniform with God
   in the highest measure, is wholly receptive of his divine inflow. Hence
   St Paul's exhorta- tion to Put on Christ,' i.^ Uiiiforinity with
   Christ. For know, when Christ was^^made man it was not a certain man
   that he assumed, he assumed human nature. Do thou go out of all things,
   then there remains alone what Christ put on and thou hast put on
   Christ.

   Whoso has a mind to know the excellence and use of absolute detachment
   let him lay to heart Christ's words to his disciples touching his
   manhood : It is good, for you, that I. go away j if I go iiqL .away the
   xaLunfprt^ cannot come tin to you ' ; as though to say, yc have too
   much love for riiy visible forTn for the perfect love of the Holy Ghost
   to be yours. Wherefore discard the form and unite with the formless
   essence, for God's ghostly comfort is intangible and is not offered
   save to those alone who despise all mortal consolations.

   List ye, good people all : there is none happier than he who stands in
   uttermost detachment. No temporal, carnal i^easurc but brings some
   ghostly mischief in its train, for the flesh lusts after things that
   run counter to the spirit and spirit lusts for things that are
   repugnant to the flesh. He who sows the tares of love in flesh reaps
   death but he who sows good love-seed in the spirit reaps of the spirit
   eternal life. The more man flees from creatures the faster hastens to
   him their creator. Consider, all yc thoughtful souls ! If even the love
   which it is given us to feel for the bodily form of Christ can keep us
   from receiving the Holy Ghost then how much more must we be kept from
   getting God by inordinate love of creature comforts ? Detachment is the
   best of all, for it cleanses the soul, clarifies the mind, kindles the
   heart and wakes the spirit ; it quickens desire and enhances virtue
   giving intuition of God ; it detaches creature and makes her one with
   God ; for love dis- joined from God is as water in the fire, but love
   in union is like the honeycomb in honey. Harkee, all rational souls !
   The swiftest steed to bear you to your goal is suffering ; none shall
   ever taste eternal bliss but those who stand with Christ in depths of
   bitterness.

   Nothing is more gall-bitter than suffering, nothing so honey-sweet as
   to have suffered. The most sure foundation for this perfection is
   humility, for he whose nature here creeps in deepest depths shall soar
   in spirit to highest height of Deity ; for joy brings sorrow and sorrow
   brings joy. Men's ways are manifold : one lives thus, another thus. He
   who would attain unto the highest life while here in time, let him take
   in a few words culled out of all the scriptures the summary philosophy
   which I will now set down.

   Keep thyself detached from all mankind ; keep thyself devoid of all
   incoming images ; emancipate thyself from everything which entails
   addition, attachment or encumbrance, and address thy mind at all times
   to a saving contemplation wherein thou bearest God fixed within thy
   heart as the object from which its eyes do never waver ; any other
   discipline, fasts, vigils, prayers, or whatever it may be, subordinate
   to this as to its end, using thereof no more than shall answer for this
   purpose, so shalt thou win the goal of all perfections.

   Here someone may object. But who can persist in unwavering
   contemplation of the divine object ? I answer, no one living here in
   time. This is told thee merely so that thou mayst know the highest,
   that whereon thy aspirations and desires should be set. But when this
   vision is withheld from thee, thou, being a good man, shalt think to
   have been robbed of thy eternal bliss and then do thou forthwith return
   into the same that it may come to thee again ; and withal it does
   behove thee to keep strict watch upon thy thoughts at all times, there
   letting, as far as possible, their goal and refuge be. Lord God, glory
   be to thee eternally. Amen.

   SPIRITUAL POVERTY

   Beati pauper es spiritu etc. Let us be eternally as poor as we were
   when we eternally were not. Abiding in him in our essence we shall be
   that we are. We shall abound in all things, but in their creator. Wc
   shall know God without any sort of likeness and love without matter and
   enjoy without possession. We shall conceive all things in perfection as
   the eternal wisdom shows them planned out in itself.

   The poor in spirit go out of themselves and all creatures : they are
   nothing, they have nothing, they do nothing, and these poor are not
   save that by grace they are God with God : which they are not aware of.
   St Augustine says, all things are God. St Diony- sius says, things are
   not God. St Augustine says, God is all of them. But Dionysius : God is
   nothing we can say or think, yet

   God is the hope of all the saints, their intuition of him wherein he is
   himself. He (Dionysius) finds him more in naught ; God is naught, he
   says. In naught all is suspended. All that has being is in suspension
   in naught, this naught being itself an incompre- hensible aught that
   all the minds in heaven and on earth cannot either fathom or conceive.
   Hence it remains unknown to creatures. When the soul attains to the
   perfection of hanging to (being suspended from) naught she will find
   herself without sin. This is due to the freedom she is poised in. Then
   on coming to the body and awareness of herself, and again finding sin
   as before, she becomes bound and then she returns into herself and
   bethinks her of what she has found yonder. Thus she raises herself up
   above herself and crosses over to the seat of all her happiness and all
   her satisfaction. St Bernard says the soul knows very well that her
   beloved cannot come to her till everything is out of her. St Augustine
   says. Well and truly loves the man who loves where he well knows he is
   not loved ; that is the best of all loving. St Paul, We know right well
   that all things work together for good to them that love God. And
   Christ said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, God's kingdom is theirs.

   They tell of various kinds of poverty of spirit. There are four. What
   he refers to here is the first poverty of spirit the soul knows when,
   illumined by the spirit of truth, things that are not God weigh with
   her not a jot ; as St Paul tells us, All things arc as dung to me.' In
   this indigence she finds all creatures irksome.

   In the second poverty she considers the merit of her excm})lar Christ
   and her own demerits and finds her own works worthless, though they be
   the sum of men's achievements. Hcitfce she laments her in the Book of
   Love, crying, The form of my beloved passed me by and I cannot follow
   him.' To this passing she is self-condemned, following the spoor of her
   quarry, Christ. So sweet his scent, she swoons away into forgetfulness
   of outward pain. As St Augustine says. The soul is where she loves
   rather than where she is giving life, and St Peter tells us that our
   dwelling is in heaven.

   The third poverty of spirit is that of the soul wherein her own nature
   is slain ; her own natural life is stone dead and there is living in
   her nothing but the spirit of God. As St Paul declares, I am dead
   nevertheless I live ; yet my life Christ liveth in me.' In this
   spiritual death she is grown poor, for all she has to leave or give has
   been taken from her ; moreover she is poor of her free will, for he is
   doing with it what he will.

   The fourth poverty is the incomprehensibility of God in her mind, her
   inability to compass him whether with knowledge or with works. But the
   deeper she gets the more the incompre-

   hensible splendour of the Deity is reflected in her poverty^ ^ For as
   far as with her inner man she has gotten intuition of divinity so far
   she follows with her outer man the willing poverty of her pattern Jesus
   Christ ; or in other words, the power of God having deprived her of all
   selfhood, she uses all creatures as she needs them, always without
   attachment, and if she has them not she can do as well without them and
   with the same detachment. She knows of nothing more that she can do but
   she rejoices in his incomprehensible truth and that created things arc
   all as naught to him and that his love has taken to itself her naught
   which is cleaving to him like a tiny spark. It was this poverty St Paul
   was in the time that he declared he heard in God unspeakable things
   which it is not lawful for a man to utter.' On that occasion he was
   knit to God so that neither life nor death could separate him from his
   love. Thus it befalls the perfectly lost soul in God, lost, not to
   creatures merely but to herself as well and aware of nothing but the
   pure unclouded radiance of God's essence. Behold her lost in him, her
   heavenly joy, and all incapable of any real wrong- doing. The saints
   invariably say that nothing whatever can dis- turb the fixity they have
   in God. Real sin is any disobedience to the law of divine love, any
   departure from the life of .Tesus Christ. He is the form and essence of
   all things. What then is real virtue ? Anything wrought in the soul by
   divine love alone, for that effects naught but its like.

   Such is the doctrine of spiritual poverty. Into this true poverty lead
   us, O superfull goodness of God. Amen.

   We read in the gospel that our Lord fed the multitude with five loaves
   and two fishes. The first loaf was, the duty of knowing ourselves :
   what we have always been to God and what we are now in relation to God.
   The second was, the duty of compassion towards our evenchristian in his
   blindness ; his misfortune ought to touch us wellnigh as keenly as our
   own. The third was, that it behoves us to study the life of our Lord
   Jesus Christ and copy it exactly so far as that is possible. The
   fourth, that it behoves us to recognise the justness of God. All
   accounts of hell-torment are true. St Dionysius has explained that
   absence from God is hell and God's presence is heaven. The fifth is,
   that it is for us to have intuition of the deity flowing into the
   Father and filling him with power and flowing into the Son filling him
   with wisdom,

   they be^g one in nature. Christ himself declared, Where I am there my
   Father is and where my Father is there I am.' And they flow into the
   Holy Ghost filling him with goodwill. As Christ said, I and my Father
   have one Spirit ' ; and the Holy Ghost flows into the soul.

   The soul by nature has received two powers. One power is understanding
   which can conceive the Holy Trinity and all its works, enclosing it, as
   one would fill and close a cask. The full cask comprehends its contents
   : it is in union with what it compre- hends, what it is full of. And so
   is understanding in union with what it understands, what it conceives.
   It is one therewith by grace as the Son is one with the Father by
   nature.

   The second power is will. It is the nobler in that by nature it can
   reach to the unknown, God namel}/. Will seizes God above knowledge, and
   in grasping what he wills the impress of the unknown God is sealed and
   stamped into the will so that the will contains God and becomes one
   with God, and will brings memory and all the soul-powers in its train,
   therefore the soul is one with God by grace as the Holy Ghost is one
   with the Father and the Son by nature. She is really in God more' than
   in her own person. As St Augustine says, The soul is where she loves
   rather than where she is giving life.' To rest in this union were
   better than to do all the works of all creatures, for so her higher
   power absorbs her lower ones and the soul can do nothing but divine
   work. But since this may not be, therefore the highest power, seeing
   her stability in God, communicates it to the lower ones so that they
   may discern good and evil. In this union Adam dwelt, and while the
   union lasted he had all the power of creatures (i,&, all cr(^turcs in
   posse) in his highest power. When a lodestonc spends its force upon a
   needle and attracts it to itself, the needle gets sufficient power to
   pass on to the needles underneath, which it raises and attaches to the
   lodestone. Part the top needle and all the rest drop off. It was like
   this with Adam : when his highest power parted from God, down fell all
   his powders. Creatures are dis- joined through failing to agree among
   themselves, one wanting one thing, one another. The powers decay
   through creatures right down to the lowest. The power of gold, for
   example, cannot give gold but gives silver, and this degradation goes
   on in silver, from which we get iron. Even so man's powers peter out to
   nothing. This accounts for the various creatures.

   But now all creatures which came forth from God must strive with all
   their powers to make one man who shall return into the union wherein
   Adam was before he fell and who shall raise all creatures up again into
   the selfsame power wherein they were, in human nature. This is
   accomplished in Christ, as he himself

   declared, When I am lifted up I will draw all men to me.' He meant that
   when he was risen in our mind he would recollect us to himself. In this
   sense all creatures are one man and that man is God. Human nature has
   not ever been as such. God is from himself eternally and the Father
   made all things from nothing. That he is in himself he is by his own
   nature, which is free from becoming and becomes not any thing, and all
   things' becoming ends in not-becoming. The Son is the same as the
   Father except that he receives from the Father all that he has and of
   all becoming he is the form. Withal he is one in the not-becoming. The
   Holy Ghost is the tie between the Father and the Son and is one with
   them in the not-becoming ; he is the author and agent of becoming in
   eternity and in time. This temporal becoming ends in eternal
   not-becoming, and the eternal not-becoming is the work of the eternal
   nature and has neither end nor beginning.

   God is his own form and matter ; his form emerges from his matter and
   according to this form does he form all things that become. But his
   simple nature is in form formless, in mode modeless, cause uncaused,
   being without becoming which trans- cends all things becoming and all
   that becomes comes to an end therein.

   God is eternal and all things have been in him eternally. They were not
   in themselves. Ere God created creatures he was nothing whatever to
   creatures, in their understanding, though in himself he was to them
   eternally the same as he is now and always shall be. No Creature could
   say God what time itself was not. What minds ignore they count for
   naught. Creature did not know God when she herself was not, therefore
   she could not speak him. This is denied by heretics who state that
   Christ brought human nature with him out of heaven, but that is not
   true. He got his manhood from our Lady Saint Mary, withal abiding as
   before in the Godhead ; and the Almighty knew in his eternal wisdom the
   ordering of all things, to wit, the Iloly Ghost. This Trinity poured
   forth into time into the naught of human nature. Thenceforward human
   nature was changeable in time and God donned human nature. In him human
   nature was God and human nature knew it with the three powers she has
   gotten from the blessed Trinity and gave God thanks therefor and loved
   him with infinite love. By this God sets such store that he loves human
   nature back with a love so great, any man who knows it possesses heaven
   incarnate. I charge you, my brothers and my sisters, that ye wax in
   knowledge and give thanks to Gk)d while ye are still in time for having
   made you from naught aught, and unite yourselves with his divine
   nature. Once out of time and your chance is gone. But if so be ye
   cannot apprehend God's nature then believe in Christ and

   follow his example steadfastly ; Jews, heathens, evil Christians, all
   who fail to exercise their God-consciousness, are lost, barring infants
   not arrived at knowledge of themselves and who are properly baptized
   into his name : in the enjoyment of Christ's name they are holding fast
   the knowledge wherewith he knows the Father eternally.

   Rejoice, all ye powers of my soul, at being joined to God so that none
   can part you. But I can neither glorify God nor love him to the full
   therein ; so, dying to the virtues I plunge me in the naught of the
   naked Godhead where, sinking eternally from naught to aught I pass with
   naught to aught.

   Though I should live here in the flesh until the judgment day bearing
   the pangs of hell it would be small matter by reason of my Lord Jesus
   Christ, since I have received from him the cer- tainty of never being
   parted from him. While I am here he is in me : after this life I am in
   him. All things are possible to me united as I am with, him to whom all
   things are possible. Before that I was at a loss to know if we are God
   by nature or by grace. Then came Jesus with the light of his own nature
   and then I spied my memory under my understanding issuing from the
   essence of my soul and my understanding flowing out of memory and will
   out of them both. Essence is revealed by the powers and the powers by
   their works. What my knowledge gave me that I loved ; what I did not
   know I could not love, and to will all things were possible. At one
   time I was sore perplexed as to whether we are God by nature or by
   grace. Fear led me to Christ who in truth knows the answer. He gave me
   light of grace whereby I saw in the divine nature three Persons, his
   Father J&gt;eing the begetter of all things. According to the words of
   St James,

   Every perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights.' The Father is
   the light itself, self-luminous in Person and in essence. In the unborn
   essence he is essential, essence without personality : essence
   self-manifest as impersonal being. The Father is that same being
   essentially. In the essence the Father loses his fatherhood completely
   ; nor is he Father there at all. The Father's know- ledge of himself in
   himself, essential and personal, he draws from his unborn essence
   through the exalted root of his personality. So far as he takes in his
   unborn essence he is paternal. Father essentially. This exalted light
   has been for ever flowing in his heart and it is flowing out of him
   into his Son, as essence and as Person, and it is flowing from them
   both into their Holy Ghost, in essence and in Person, and these three
   shed one light essential and personal. The Father she^s on both the
   light of his essence and his Person ; and the Father and the Son shed
   on the Holy Ghost the light of both essence and Person. The unborn

   the oneness of the three Persons and the bom essence is God as begetter
   so far as it flows into the Persons and so far as»it emanates with the
   Persons. Not that the essence begets ; essence begets not. The Son and
   the Holy Ghost are twin lights of the God- bearing essence in the
   paternal source where the Father is drawing his born being out of his
   unborn essence. The Father knows himself with his Son, perceiving
   himself in himself. For this the Son is the light ; and he wills
   himself in himself and for this the Holy Ghost is the light. Father and
   Son have one will and that is the Holy Ghost : it graces the soul, this
   divine nature, and so suffuses the powers of the soul that the soul can
   do nothing except divine work. Just as a spring in its bed at the roots
   of the flowers gives them itself and the flowers grow verdant and
   coloured on the spring water, so deity giving itself to the powers of
   the soul makes them grow in the likeness of God. His image appears in
   her powers, his likeness in her virtues. The more divine nature the
   soul receives the liker she grows to the nature of God and the closer
   becomes her union with God. Her union may become so strait that God on
   a sudden absorbs her in himself and that without remainder whether vice
   or virtue, nor can the soul distinguish aught that might be taken for
   herself. God takes her for a creature. Be not deluded by the light of
   nature. To a soul on the ascent to higher knowledge in the light of
   grace, dimmer and dimmer glows the light of nature. If she would know
   the very truth itself she must make certain whether she is detached
   from things ; whether she is dead to self ; whether she loves God with
   his own love and without self-intent and has nothing to hold her
   backend keep her from him ; and whether God alone is alive in her. If
   so then she has lost herself as Mary lost Christ. Three days she sought
   him knowing all the while that she would find him. And Christ,
   meanwhile, was af his Father's school of higher learnin)? all unheeding
   of his mother^a quest. The noble soul which goes, to school in God
   learns to knoiy what God is in the Godhead and what Gqd is in the
   Trinity and what God is in humanity and gets to know his will.

   God in, the Godhead is spiritual substance, so elemental that we can
   say nothing about it excepting that it is naught. To say it is aught
   were more lying than true. God in the Trinity is the living light in
   its radiant splendour, a comjjlex of one nature with distinct Persons,
   The (light) that is life is not this light. Though one might predicate
   three natures to these (Persons or) distinctions there is but one
   nature to their union for they all act together exactly like one,
   working all at once in all creatures. According to St Augustine, the
   precision (or justice) of God in the Godhead, in the Trinity and in all
   creatures is the chief delight there is in heaven.

   God in human nature is a lamp of living light and this light shines in
   the darkness and the darkness comprehends not this light. Darkness ever
   flees from light as night does from the day. Thence comes her knowledge
   of God's will. Now St Paul says, It is God's will that we be
   sanctified.' And our sanctification lies in this, in knowing what we
   were before time, what we are in time and what we shall be after time.
   Lost during these three days, soul pays no heed to body till it joins
   her in the temple and is subject to her without murmuring.

   The Trinity is the heart of divine and human nature and human nature
   flows into the Trinity in a steady stream of love. Supposing the soul
   crosses over, then she sinks down and down in the abysm of the Godhead
   nor ever finds a footing unless it be that she has taken with her some
   temporal thing : resting on temporal things brings her back into the
   Trinity. Things fashioned in time have a ground of their own whereon
   they can rest ; they light on no ground in the Godhead, lly this same
   token the soul knows that she is creature, for all she has she has
   received in time from the three Persons. She flows out and in in the
   three Persons, 'fhe reason why Christ's soul did never plumb the deeps
   of Godhead is that she too is creature made in time. God is indeed the
   matter of the soul, of her energies but not of her creation. Tier
   energies are eternal because he is eternal. This matter never fails
   her. When fire lacks fuel it goes back to its own land. So would the
   soul eome to naught were her matter to fail. When all her work is done
   she with her powers remains in God her matter ; she casts herself in
   her impartible essence into the passive, immaterial Godhead ; that is
   her native land. Then the Godhead is to her all things in a single
   passive power, and she withal all things to it, just as the heart of
   the sea gives forth in the bowels of the earth the waters which
   circulate back to the heart of the sea on the face of the earth.
   Suppose one dropped a millstone from the siin tp earth, the earth being
   pierced straight through the centre, the millstone would stop falling
   at the centre of the earth. Here is tiie heart of yie earth, the
   stopping-place of everything on earth. §o is the Trinity the stopping
   -place of creatures as a whole, all the. Godhead has being gotten
   impartible and eternal from itself. The Father is the manifestation of
   the Godhead, the Son is the image and countenance of the Faither and
   the Holy Ghost is the light of his countenance and the love of them
   both ; all they have have they gotten eternally from their own selves.
   But the three Persons stooped in compassion towards human nature and
   the Son was made man and in this world was more despised than any man
   on earth, suffering want and pain from creatures himself had made in
   conjunction with his Father, by whose will he became man.

   Christ lived in time down to his death and then, arising from the dead,
   this most despised of men is seen united with the Godhead in the Person
   of the Christ who came on earth. Human nature wedded with the divine
   nature ; her eternal portion, fellowship with divine nature in the same
   Person.

   This is God's good will, that we should know ourselves and that we
   should know God, and our salvation lies in putting our know- ledge into
   practice and loving in God all that we know. He who knows God in very
   truth is bound to love and will nothing but what God loves and wills.
   As St Paul says, I do good and doing naught but good to me all things
   are possible. Many a thing is lawful for me which I do not lest I sin.'
   Our Lord commands us to be without sin. To whom all things are possible
   it is also possible to keep this commandment.

   The saints declare that all things are in God as they have been in God
   eternally ; not that we were in God in the gross nature we have here :
   we were in God eternalwise, like art in the artist. God saw himself and
   saw all things. God was not therefore manifold as things are here in
   separation. Though creatures here are manifold they are but one idea in
   God. God in himself is just the one alone. When creature goes back to
   her first cause she knows God simply as one in form and essence and
   threefold in operation. What intellect knows is knowledge and knowledge
   stops at what is known, with what is known becoming one. Into the
   simple idea no knowledge ever entered, for this impartible exemplar
   after which God created all creatures towers God-high above creatures.
   Creature in pursuing God to his eternal heights must mount above all
   creatures, nay, beyond her very self, her own wont and uses, and follow
   agnosia into the desolate Godhead. St Dionysius says, God's desert is
   God's simple nature.' A creature's desert is her simple nature. In the
   desert of herself she is robbed of her own form and in Gk)d's desert,
   leading out of hers, she is bereft of name ; there she is no more
   called soul, she is called God with God.

   Peradventure ye will say, Being in this exalted state why does the soul
   not raise the body above necessity of earthly things ? ' To which I
   answer, at this stage the soul has a body of perfection which uses all
   things to the glory of God, there being now betwixt God and the soul no
   barrier nor hindrance. So far as the soul has followed God into the
   desert of his Godhead so far the body follows Christ into his desert of
   willing poverty and is one with

   God. Well may the Father say, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased : follow ye him.* All creatures are with God : the being that
   they have God gives them with his presence. Saith the bride in the Book
   of Love, I have run round the circle and have found no end to it, so I
   cast myself into the centre.'

   This circle which the loving soul ran round is all the Trinity has ever
   wrought.

   Why is the work of the Trinity called a circle ? Because the three
   Persons have wrought their own likeness in all creatures which are
   rational. The Trinity is the origin of all things and all things return
   into their origin. This is the circle the soul runs. When does she run
   in this circle ? She does so when she muses : All this that he has made
   he could make again a thousand times if he were so minded. So she goes
   round in endless chain. The least of all his creatures she can find no
   end to nor can she appro- found its worth. Spent with her quest she
   casts herself into the centre. This point is the power of the Trinity
   wherein unmoved it is doing all its work. Therein the soul becomes
   omnipotent.

   The three Persons are one omnipotence. This is the motionless point and
   the unity of the Trinity. The circumference is the incomprehensible
   work of the three Persons. The point is fixed. The union of the Persons
   is the essence of the point. In this point God runs through change
   without otherness, involving into unity of essence, and the soul as one
   with this fixed point is capable of all things. But her powers, wherein
   she imitates the Trinity, with them she cannot apprehend its unity. The
   work of the Trinity has proved the undoing of many Paris theologians :
   en- grossed in the working of the Trinity they have never gotten at
   their unity. The centre is equally near to all ends, like time in all
   lands. Now is the time here and now is the same time in Rome.

   Saith the bride in the Book of Love, He has wounded me with a glance of
   his eye.' This refers to the unitive force which streams down from the
   point, isolating the soul from creatures and changing things and
   gathering her up again into the point therewith to be united and
   therein to be eternally established.

   One is conscious of this glance within the confines of the soul when
   she is quite unoccupied, innocent of the practice whether of vice or
   virtue. During this quiet state intuitive perception is most vivid, so
   it is then he stabs her with his glance to make her really feel how he
   has known and loved her while she herself was not. This serves as a
   piercing reminder to the soul to go out of herself. Whom this glance
   wounds not is not nor ever has been wounded by love. [Concerning it St
   Bernard says, To him whose spirit has felt this glance it is
   unutterable ; to him who knows it

   not it is incredible.' 'Tis an arrow shot without anger and felt
   without pain. Thence starts the clear and limpid stream of healing
   grace which enlightens the inner eye to perceive in blissful behold-
   ing the delight of the divine affliction wherein we share unheard of
   spiritual graces, favours untold, not preached nor written down in any
   book.]

   (Saith the soul), Lord, thou thyself declarest that thou hast made me
   like thyself. That passes the ingenuity of man, for no philosopher is
   sage enough to fabricate the double of himself. Lord,' she cries, if
   thou hast made me like to thee, grant me to see thee seized of the
   power wherein thou hast created me, to know thee in the wisdom wherein
   thou hast known me, to conceive thee as thou conceivest me ; and grant
   me Lord that by thy grace 1 be made one with thee in nature as thy Son
   is one with thy nature eternally, and that thy grace may be my nature ;
   for, Lord, thy grace becomes thy nature and in thy nature we become
   God, as the Father in his nature is God by nature.'

   Christ exhorts us to be perfect as his heavenly Father is perfect in
   his nature. He says, God is more near to you than yc are to
   yourselves.' And in the same sense St Augustine says the soul has
   private entry to the divine nature, where things for her all come to
   naught. Then she is ignorant with knowing, loveless with loving, dark
   with enlightenment. Then to know God would be an imperfection ; to know
   herself in God would be an imper- fection or to know God in her would
   be an imperfection. The incomprehensible essence she absorbs above all
   knowledge by grace, as the Father does by nature ; and the born essence
   being gotten in her understanding as the Father has gotten it in him,
   she steals out of herself and pierces the naked essence there to retain
   no more of things than when she issued forth from God. She comes so
   utterly to naught that there is nothing left but God ; God outshines
   her as the sun the moon, and she in God's own subtile nature flows into
   all that God is flowing in eternally.

   If thou hast apprehended me, there are two points to notice in these
   words. First, the soul knowing she was made from naught desires to see
   who made her. And secondly, her words, Grant me to see thee as creating
   me,' mean that she wants to feel the faith and love wherein she was
   created. For then the soul sees God though she does not see through
   him. She knows God although she cannot fathom him ; she apprehends God
   but cannot comprehend him as he comprehends himself. St Paul says, Then
   we shall know as we are known.' Stripped of her own being, with God her
   only being, the soul sees God with God, knows and con- ceives God with
   God. One high authority declares that the soul sees, knows, apprehends
   God with his very own essence which is

   the very essence of the soul. The soul sees, knows, conceives God as
   she is herself conceived in the pure intellect of the Deity. Then soul
   is comprehender as well as comprehended. But no man in this body and
   after the mode of his own mind can understand how soul is both
   conceiver and conceived be he not wholly sunk into himself, into pure
   knowledge of his own God-nature where no created thought did ever
   enter.

   Now mark. The naught whereby soul comes to naught is the turning from
   images and forms to stay at none of them, for the divine nature is
   neither form nor image. And soul divorced from images and forms is like
   to the formless nature of God. This is the secret passage of the soul
   into divine nature. The soul which has nowhere to turn is ready to turn
   to the image of God. In other words, she goes with naught to naught :
   to the divine nature whereto none may attain be he not stripped of all
   mental matter. Alas ! how sorely they obstruct this secret passage,
   those who so lightly stay at temporal things ! Dionysius exhorted his
   disciples in this sense, saying, Wouldst know the hidden mystery of God
   ? then transcend whatever hinders thy pure perception, whatever thou
   caust grasp with thy understanding. God has nothing so hid as to be
   beyond the ken of a soul that has the wit to seek it right diligently
   and with prudence.'

   A hard saying this, there is nothing in him so hidden as to be beyond
   her ken. Yet mark these facts.

   The power of things resides in essence. Now the soul is capable of
   knowing all things in her highest power, she being all closeted ill her
   secret chamber. To the soul thus freed from things there is disclosed
   his secret essence. She is able to receive his arcane power. As St Paul
   says, 1 can do all things in him that strength- eneth me.' Up, noble
   soul ! seek thee no other place than this unneccssitous naught that did
   create thee, the same in its im- movableness shall be thy place ; there
   shalt thou be more motionless than naught. -- But this is traversed by
   some learned men who hold it is impossible. Naught, say they, is
   motionless, so how can the soul be more motionless than naught ? The
   soul is a created aught which can be moved : she is a variable ; naught
   is a constant. The soul, for instance, goes from light to light until
   she finds the sovran truth where all things end. So too the soul is
   moved in that she is aware of things other than herself. Naught has no
   awareness. Therefore aught is more movable than naught. So runs the
   argument against our thesis. Now to prove that the soul is more
   motionless than naught.

   The arch-good, God, is more motionless than naught. And the most
   perfect likeness of this motionless arch-good is also most immovable.
   Haply thou wilt object : Naught is the same as

   Gk&gt;d for both of them are non-existent. Not so. For naught is
   nothing to itself or any creature. But God is to himself his aught and
   naught to the mind of any creature. Withal the creature aught tells
   forth God's aught by nature rather than its own. God's aught is
   intellectual being. Dionysius says, The intel- lectual light that God
   is, gat its own image in the rational soul.' Now if God is more
   motionless than naught, it follows that the soul as reflected into her
   motionless aught, God namely, is more motionless than naught. Naught is
   movable out of itself when naught becomes aught and always is moved
   when aught is pro- duced out of naught. Not so the soul : she always is
   aught and can never be naught. Behold the soul more motionless than
   naught, God having set her free, free to assert her own free will.

   Her motion is the quest of him who has never loved nor was ever loved.
   Which may be interpreted thus. The soul, uplifting with all her might
   and main herself above herself to love the sovran good, sees clearly
   she can never reach the divine aught accom- panied by any of her
   powers. So down she goes again into herself, and the motionless aught
   bides unbeloved of her and of all that is not its very self. Thus the
   divine aught is never loved by her nor by anything that is not itself,
   nor has it ever loved. You can put it like this. He loves nothing but
   himself or his image in all things. But since he is not love nor
   anything named, there- fore he loves not neither is he loved. This is
   the meaning of St Dionysius' words, God dwells in motionless calm.' And
   the bride says in the Book of Love, I have crossed all the mountains,
   aye, even my own powers, and have reached the dark power of the Father.
   There heard I without sound, there saw I without light, there breathed
   I without motion ; there did I taste what savoured not, there did I
   touch what touched not back. Then my heart was bottomless, my soul
   loveless, my mind formless and my nature natureless.'

   Now what does the soul mean by crossing all the mountains ? ' She means
   she has transcended her own rational powers and gotten to the dark
   power of the Father * where all rational dis- tinctions end. There
   heard I without sound.' Hearing without sound means intuition, direct
   apprehension. There saw I without light.' Seeing without light means
   undefined, vague perception in the naught. There breathed I without
   stir ' : the inspiration of unity wherein all things are still. There
   tasted I what savoured not ' : over all sensible things hangs the
   motionless haze of unity.

   * There did I touch what touched not back ' : alien, unalloyed essence
   of all creatures : the substance of all things substantial.

   Then my heart was bottomless ' : the overwhelming wonder of

   my powers. And my soul loveless ' : powers and senses blotted out. And
   my spirit formless ' : the sealing of the mind in the unformed form and
   image of God. And my nature natureless ' : my own nature withered away
   till nothing is left but the one unique is. This is-ness is the unity,
   the being of itself and of all things. St Dionysius says, The one alone
   is the life of lives, being of beings, reason of reasons, nature of
   natures, light of lights and yet not light, not life, not nature.' Of
   it St James declares, The most perfect gift comes down from the Father
   of lights.' Again St Dionysius says, The First Cause is above all names
   and tran- scends love ; it is superessential, superintelligible,
   super-rational and supernatural. The First Cause is neither light nor
   darkness.' Behold how different from all caused things.

   Saith the soul in the Book of Love, No one is God to me and I am soul
   to none.' By no one is God to me ' she means merely that no entity,
   nothing nameable, is her God. Again the words, I am soul to none ' mean
   that she is so void of self she has not got it in her to be aught to
   anyone. This is the state in which the soul should be : in utter
   destitution. The soul cries in the Book of Love, He is mine and I am
   his.' It were better she had said, He is not mine nor am I his,' for
   God who is in all is therein all his own. She can lay claim to naught :
   she has lost every whit whereto any wight could in anywise be aught or
   she withal be aught to any wight. No one is her God and she is no one's
   soul, wherefore she cries in the Book of Love, Fly from me, beloved, on
   the feathers of the wind.'

   What is the meaning of these feathers of the wind whereon the soul
   rides ? The feathers are the choirs of Seraphim. Th^ wind of their
   feathers is their clear seraphic knowledge. Above this dwells the soul.
   But not till she has left behind all images and forms, not harbouring
   any, not resting upon any. She must have lost her individual motion.
   And thus divested of her creature- hood, having no hold on anything at
   all, she sinks into downright nothingness ; there she is concealed from
   every creature. To this same naught no Seraph's understanding can
   attain ; in this naught dwells the soul, super-seraphic, above all such
   knowing. Thus the soul rides on the feathers of the wind.

   But what a perfect life this man must lead I How dead his soul to every
   kind of motion ! St John declares, Blessed are the dead that die in
   God.' To this end, O man, do thou free thyself from every sort of
   sensible affection. God is exempt from such, and it behoves thee, man,
   to be the same if thou wouldst solve his hidden mystery. For this, look
   you, soul must be stripped of all her senses. St Dionysius spoke of
   this to Timothy, one of his disciples, when talk arose about St Paul
   who had been put to death.

   Alas ! my friend ' (said Timothy), and shall we never hear again the
   loved voice of our master ? * The saint replied, Friend Timothy, my
   counsel is to leave behind us corporal things and go to God. But this
   we cannot do save with blind eyes and alien senses ; not that we ought
   to have misleading senses : we must transcend sense and knowledge to
   get to his mysterious unity.' Anent which St Augustine says, * The soul
   has a private door into divinity where for her all things amount to
   naught.' There she is ignorant with knowing, will-less with willing,
   dark with enlighten- ment. To wot of self would mean her imperfection ;
   to wot of God would mean her imperfection ; to wot of self in God or
   God in her would mean her imperfection : self is reduced to utter
   naught and there is nothing left but God, for God outshines her as the
   sun the moon and she with God's all-penetrativeness streams into the
   eternal Godhead where God keeps ever flowing into God.

   Nothing is without beginning, and since nothing is without beginning
   God could make us from nothing better than nothing, like himself. Alone
   God's power did make the soul, so she like him is free from matter. And
   soul could have no homelier road into divinity than by way of nothing
   to nothing, for nothing unites like natural affinity. But St John
   Chrysostom declares that none can take it till his outward and his
   inward senses are focussed to clear vision of the Deity.

   The naught we were before we were created was indigent of naught..
   Moreover of itself it could do absolutely naught and naught withstood
   creatures ; all but the power of God ; it was this caused naught to
   stir when God made all things from naught. Now we have got to be more
   motionless than naught. -- But how ? ' Mark how. God gat the soul the
   mistress of herself, not overriding her free will nor once exacting
   from her aught that she will not ; so whatever in this body she elects
   of her free will she is free to carry through. Say she chooses to need
   nothing and to be more motionless than naught, then assembling all her
   powers into her free will so as not to be hindered by herself or any
   thing, she centres herself in the motionless God who was n'er moved by
   any act done by the blessed Trinity nor is not indigent of any thing
   the blessed Trinity has ever wrought. To reach this point of needing
   naught and being more immutable than naught, soul must be sunk so deep
   in the bottomless well of the divine naught that nothing can draw her
   thereout to spend herself on mortal things, but there she steadfastly
   abides ; as the heavenly Father is ever- abiding in his nature without
   let or hindrance so the soul abides therein without let or hindrance,
   as far as that is possible to creature.

   -- Pray, Sir, how should it be impossible seeing that the soul was
   created to that end ? ' -- ^Because, you see, if she does stoop to
   baser things to let herself be satisfied with these, then that which is
   above her is beyond her reach, whereas God keeps no secrets from the
   soul whose lofty nature is equal to the quest. Up, noble Soul ! Out of
   thyself so far thou never comest in again and enter into God so deep
   thou never comcst out again : there stay nor ever deign to stoop to
   creature ; and burden not thyself with things made clear to thee, nor
   wander among objects presented to thy mind, nor be not hindered from
   achievement by any service. Steadfastly pursue thy simple nature and
   the unnecessitous nothingness, seeking no other place than this
   unnecessitous naught. God who made thee out of nothing, he in his
   unnecessitous nothing- ness and immovableness shall hiipsclf be thy
   place. There thou shalt be more immovable than nothing.

   They that serve God for gain with outward works reap their reward in
   creatures, such as heaven and heavenly things. But they that serve God
   by interior acts are rewarded with the un- created, namely, the works
   of the blessed Trinity.

   Mark this. No fire no light, no earth no life, no air no love, no water
   no place. Ergo, God is not light nor life nor love nor nature nor
   spirit nor semblance nor anything we can put into words. God flows into
   (iod and God flows out of God and God knows himself God in himself and
   knows himself God in his creatures in general and he knows himself God
   in the nobte soul in particular. The Father is almighty in the soul,
   the Son all- wise, the Holy Ghost all-loving, loving all creatures with
   the same love. But he manifests as different and the soul is destined
   to know things as they are and conceive things as they are when, seized
   thereof, she plunges into the bottomless well of the divine nature and
   becomes so one with God that she herself would say that she is God. The
   soul withdrawn into herself till nothing made or named takes shape in
   her and she is bare as God of any name, gathers herself up above
   herself into her (iod and takes herself cum God for God. God is not
   black nor white, nor large nor small, he has no place nor any past nor
   future time, and the soul is like him only in so far as she can project
   herself above all creatures.

   The soul is a creature receptive to everything named, but the nameless
   she cannot receive until she is gotten so deep into God that she is
   nameless herself. And then none can tell if it is she that has gotten
   God or God has gotten her. Dionysius says,

   MEISTER ECKHART

   God has conceived himself in her, so utterly absorbing her that she is
   now no longer self but God.' And the soul's inferior powers have
   distinction of person, love uniting the persons not the essence. The
   soul is destined to this knowledge when, on the ebb-tide of God's
   glory, she is borne back into the bottomless ground of the fount whence
   she flowed forth and finds she is not from herself.

   The highest boon, the chief good of the soul, is not from herself.
   Christ himself declared he was not from himself. The truest thing we
   have is our intuition of not being from ourselves and that we ourselves
   are not of ourselves.

   God has done all things for himself and he has made the soul like to
   himself, over all things, under all things, in all things, out of all
   things and withal abiding in herself impartibly. But she is noblest
   keeping to the desert wherein she is naught and there is nothing doing.
   St Dionysius prays, Lord, lead me into the desert where thou art
   formless that in thy solitude I may lose all form.' The soul is in all
   things in her subtile nature wherein she inhabits all things without
   affecting them or being affected by them. Thus transcending things she
   cries, Lord, fetch me into thy Godhead where thou art naught, for what
   is aught I deem to be not God.' The soul is over all things in her
   freedom ; she knows none can compel her, not even God himself.
   Surrendering her free will to God she plunges into her own emptiness,
   beseeching, Lord, take me into the gloom of thy Godhead that in thy
   dark I may lose all my light, for nothing that can be revealed do I
   account as light.' She is out of all things in her power of
   understanding, whichp makes her so elastic she is able to hold God as
   well as all his creatures. Embodying God thus she is more God than her
   own self. This is hers by grace. Aught of God is God entire and aught
   of him holds his whole being. This he is in the lowliest as much as in
   the loftiest nature. A small bung stops the barrel no less well than
   the biggest.

   Comprehension belongs to his paternal power. He grasps him- self in
   himself in all creatures and grasps himself in his countenance whereto
   he admits no creature and whereinto no creature can get. And this
   comprehension he veils in a cloud of distortion so that no creature can
   grasp him as he grasps himself. What the soul grasps in the light she
   loses in the darkness. Yet she makes for the cloud, deeming his
   darkness better than her light. There she suddenly loses her light and
   herself in his darkness.

   The soul cries in the Book of Love, No one is my God and I am no one's
   soul, and nothing manifest to me do I take for God. I flee from God for
   God's sake.' St John says, God is love.' But theologians argue that if
   he means the love wherewith the soul loves

   God, this is not true. Were that love God, wherewith the soul can love,
   it would not fail her as it does. This is a natural love, the virtue.
   But suppose her will is turned toward God, then Gk)d draws love from
   nothing and pours it into the virtue, so her love is both nature and
   grace. In grace God gives himself to the soul and the Holy Ghost unites
   with her love, and the love which is the Holy Ghost is God, and the
   love which is grace is the nature which unites the soul with God, and
   in this union the soul is absorbed into God and loves God with his own
   love in God, which in herself she cannot do.

   The Father is the revelation of all things and the Son is the image of
   all things and the Holy Ghost is the fulfilling of that order.
   Philosophers say that things in contact with God are not God but his
   works. The soul is self-motive before she is moved and her being moved
   is the work of God, the soul being the agent while the work itself is
   creature. The power whieh perfects the soul, which sweeps her out of
   herself without her aid or abetting, is God. I can touch the minster,
   not carry it off. That we attribute to God matter and fonn and work is
   due to our gross senses. Theologians tell of the light which gives no
   light, which has no form nor matter and is yet a creature. To know God
   as he is we must be absolutely free from knowledge. Thus St Augus- tine
   says, Lord, I know not what I love in thee if it be not light.' As God
   is timeless and modeless so he is also nameless. St Paul says, There be
   many that run but one receiveth the prize.' All the soul-powers run but
   pure nature alone receives the crown, for, according to Dionysius, this
   race is nothing else than the flight from creatures to unite with their
   creator. Atoned wilji her creator the soul has lost her name for she
   herself does not exist : God has absorbed her into him just as the
   sunlight swallows up the dawn till it is gone.

   Tell me, where is the soul's abode ? -- Upon the pinions of the wind.
   The pinions are the powers of divine nature. The wind is the waging of
   the powers of the soul's divine nature. When he thrusts her sins under
   her eyes she sinks down into him like a fish in the sea. All creatures
   lose their names on entering human nature. Hence Christ's exhortation,
   Preach the gospel to all creatures/ He meant only human beings.

   Observe when a man is all creatures. When he has the power of them all.
   When a man, knowing with his outward senses all corporal things,
   detaches himself from them and abides therein without attachment ;
   when, knowing with his interior senses all spiritual things, he
   detaches himself from these and abides therein without attachment, then
   at length that man is all creatures ; then, not till then, that man has
   come to his own nature and is

   ready to go into God. If we fail to find. God it is because we seek in
   semblance what has no resemblance. The scriptures tell us more of his
   unlikeness than his likeness. Origen says the soul's quest of God comes
   by self-observation. If she knew herself she would know God also. If
   she pictures herself or pictures her God that comes of over-defining.
   On merging into the Godhead all definition is lost.

   Dionysius says to Timothy, Friend Timothy, if thou dost view the spirit
   of truth, pursue it not with mortal senses. It is so swift, it comes
   rushing.' God must be sought in estrangement, forget- fulness and
   non-sense ; for the Godhead has in it all things in posse without the
   least likeness to anything. The supremely pure splendour of the
   impartible essence illumines all things at once. According to
   Dionysius, beauty is order : symmetry with supreme lucidity. In this
   sense the Godhead is the beauty of the three Persons. And it behoves
   the soul to order her lower powers to her higher and her higher ones to
   God ; the outer senses to the inner and the inner ones to reason ;
   thought servant to intelligence, intelligeiKie to will and her will to
   their unity, then the soul will be a unity with nothing flowing into
   her except pure deity as it is proceeding from itself. Concerning this
   St Dionysius says the soul has flung her faculties into her pure being
   and only her chief power remains at work. And one doctor says that when
   the chief power takes command the rest all enter into it losing their
   own activities, so now behold the soul in her proper order and in her
   pure nature, her pure nature being her exalted light-nature which is
   potentially all things.

   Th^ Godhead flows into the Father, into the Son and the Holy Ghost,
   into itself in eternity and in time into creatures. It gives to each as
   much as it can hold : to stones existence, to the trees their growth,
   to birds their flight, to beasts their pleasures, to the angels reason
   and to man free nature. God was made man and took upon himself by grace
   the nature of all things in time even as in eternity he has them all by
   nature. St Paul says, Christ is to me all things.' One Person with two
   natures. Each seems all things to each. It is a play of the light and
   reflection of his own nature. God's being is first being, flowing
   being, fixed being, initial being and final being.

   From essence in general emanates power and work. The three Persons are
   in this respect the storehouse of divinity, and the three Persons
   descend into the essence of the soul by grace, and the Persons bring
   divine nature into the soul in their train, one nature coursing through
   the other. The higher powers of the soul flow out of the essence of the
   soul as the three Persons issue from the Godhead, And when God pours
   his grace into the soul he pours

   it into the essence of the soul, for into the essence of the soul no
   fleck can fall let her powers do what they may. The higher powers of
   the soul draw their seeming from the essence of grace in the essence of
   the soul, and her chief power transcends the lower ones in nature.

   Mind big with the conception of God's nature is the corollary of
   Christ's Person in human nature. When the soul is absorbed into God's
   nature her sins and shortcomings arc stripped off and she becomes God,
   divine in nature ; she enjoys divine nature in herself just as the
   Father does in him. She gets it not from her own nature : she takes
   divine nature from God into her nature. She receives perfection and
   power. Hence the words of St Paul, I can do all things in him that
   strengtheneth me.' Wisdom springs up in understanding ; it begins in
   understanding and ends in desire and has neither heart nor thought. As
   St Dionysius says, When the soul, finding this outlet, has a footing in
   eternity and in time in her own understanding, therein she shall return
   into the flow where God is flowing back into himself, and does not flow
   away.'

   God is flowing back into himself, recking no more of creatures than he
   did when they were not. And the soul shall do the same. She shall with
   her humanity conceive the Person of the Son and with the Person of the
   Son she shall apprehend the Father and the Holy Ghost in both and them
   both in the Holy Ghost ; and with the Person of the Father she shall
   grasp his impartible nature and in his nature discerning the abyss she
   shall flow into the void bereft of matter and of form. Form, matter,
   mind and mode she loses in the unity for she herself has come to naught
   : God is^oing all her work, he preserves her in his being and leads her
   in his power into his naked Godhead. She flows with his deity into all
   that God is flowing in. She is all things' place and has herself no
   place. This is the spirit of wisdom which has neither heart nor
   thought.

   Soul flowing in the Deity is so nearly God that in the power of the
   Father she receives divinity, (she) by grace as the Father does by
   nature. St Paul says, In one image shall we go from glory to glory.'
   Meaning that we shall receive the impartible Godhead with all that
   flows therefrom and shall therein conceive the Deity as the Deity
   conceives itself. Her will and God's will shall be one, and wherever
   God has gotten himself there she is with God. To this none may attain
   while in this body except God grant his best gift to the soul, namely,
   the vision of God which confirms the soul in the Trinity and in the
   image of the Godhead.

   THE DROWNING

   Though there be neither hell nor heaven yet will I love God ; thee
   Father and thy sovran nature wherein the Trinity abides in the unity
   whence it gets its power. -- Now you desire to hear about this hidden
   and exalted nature of the Trinity. The Persons are God in their
   personality. Godhead by nature in their oneness. But you must know what
   God and Grodhead are. The former has distinctions ; which the soul of
   me explains by the reflection of the exalted unity. This shines in its
   own essence wholly indiscriminate. Therein is contained its unity
   entire, including the distinctions of lofty personality. The river is
   fontal wherein unity abides ; the one alone is unnecessitous, poised in
   itself in sable stillness. In- comprehensible and yet self-evident.
   Light is the first thing to appear ; it beguiles the mind into the
   unknown without itself, everlasting, in-drawn, plunged in gloom. There
   it is befooled, there it is bereft of light's darkness, losing them
   both in the abyss ; there that mysterious thing the mind is estranged
   in the unity which is withal its life.

   O unfathomable sink, in thy depth thou art high and in thy height
   profound ! -- How so ? -- ^That is hidden from us in thy bottomless
   abysm. St Paul declares that it shall be made known to us. In this
   gnosis the mind transcends itself; it has been absorbed into the
   Trinity. There the mind dies all dying in the wonder of the Godhead,
   for with that unity it is confused ; the perscvial losing its name in
   sameness. There mind, atoned, is accounted naught ; there it loses the
   means of divinity. Light and darkness, it is rid of both, matter as
   well as form. The spark thus bare, made naught from its own naught, is
   s\^llowed up in its naught's aught. This same naught is poverty in the
   Persons, which beguiles the mind and reduces it to unity. In the
   embrace of this sovran one which naughts the separated self of things,
   being is one without distinction although a thing created in its
   individual nature. The one I mean is wordless. One and one uniting,
   void shines into void. Where these two abysms hang, equally spirated,
   de-spirated, there is the supreme being ; where God gives up the ghost,
   darkness reigns in the unknown known unity. This is hidden from us in
   his motionless deep. Creatures cannot penetrate this aught.

   Well that this aught transcends us.

   Even so loving it transcendently,

   Plunge in ; this is the drowning.

   THIS IS THE GLOSS ON THE DROWNING

   It is true spiritual perfection to love God for his own sake regardless
   of hell or heaven. We must love the three Persons in their unity of
   nature and their one nature in the three Persons. The Trinity has its
   power in the unity and the unity has its dignity in the Trinity. It
   belongs, moreover, to the noble mind to perceive the distinction
   between God and Godhead ; how it is the three Persons in him have
   gotten his unity as their natural being. Each Person has for nature his
   unity entire, so each of the Persons is in himself God and in his
   nature Godhead. God is God in the Persons and Godhead in his nature :
   in his impartible nature. The unity shines forth in the Trinity as
   articulate speech. But the perfect reflection of the one is shining by
   itself in lonely silence, there safely pent as one and indivisible.
   Further, the three Persons in their utterance keep their distinctive
   pro- perties. The Father is source of the Son and the Son is the river
   thereof eternally flowing out of the Father as Person, while abiding
   within him in essence. The Father and the Son give forth their breath
   (or spirit). Thus the originated river with its original source is the
   origin of the Holy Ghost. Unity which, logically speaking, is the
   condition of the original source is also the condition of the river
   which, together with its source, is source of the Holy Ghost. And as
   this oneness is the nature of them both so too it is the nature of the
   breath exhaled by both. This river then is fontal. The unity which is
   in them both is unnecessitous, it has no need of speech, but subsists
   alone in unbroken silence.* Not that the utterance dies, i.e. the
   spoken essence. But where speech beats into the silence of its nature
   both have one common character, the character of sameness. What is this
   ? It is the motionless dark that no one knows but he in whom it reigns
   : the one with its selfhood. First to arise in it is light. Lo, this is
   the originated river, and origin itself, which has the character of
   light as proceed- ing forth in its individual nature. And what here
   streams forth to view will reveal itself and that from which it
   springs. In its interior procession this originated river, which is
   also the origin itself, has the nature of obscure, unmanifest
   intelligence, but the light proceeding forth brings revelation to the
   mind, beguiling it out of itself into its mysterious indwelling cause.
   There it is shorn of light's illusion. Of everything, that is, which
   has been revealed to it in the fonn of light. Thereof it is despoiled,
   but now it finds another and better than this light-like understanding.
   Light has mode without knowledge. Darkness is knowledge without mode, a
   thing, that is, we can in nowise have. The mind

   is rid of light when it is rid of mode ; and it is rid of darkness
   when, letting go of all natural things, it sinks in nameless actuality.
   Then it loses both light and darkness in the abyss that creature in its
   own right never plumbs. Such is the estrangement in the one as
   foreshadowed in the ordinary mind, but the realization of unity which
   the blessed have lies in the exquisite consciousness of another than
   themselves.

   O unfathomable void, bottomless to creatures and to thine own self, in
   thy depth art thou exalted in thy impartible, imperish- able actuality
   ; in the height of thy essential power thou art so deep thou dost
   engulf thy simple ground which is there concealed from all that thou
   art not ; yet those whom thou wouldst commune with shall know thee with
   thyself. As St Paul declares, Then shall we know as we are known.' This
   knowledge the mind gets not from its individual nature ; the unity
   hales it in the Three into itself, that is, to its true and natural
   abode where it transcends itself in what inhales it ; where the spirit
   dies all dying in the wonder of the Godhead.' This dying of the spirit
   means its con- fusion with the one essential nature though it remains
   discrete in the Persons of the Trinity. This shows the activity of
   spirit ; its having variety of Persons. But by their union is shed a
   single light, for the three Persons are aglow with one intrinsic
   nature, like three lights with one shine. According to St Augustine
   this essential light is cast by the Persons into the pure spirit. At
   its glance the spirit forfeits self and selfliood and the uses of its
   powers. Such is the effect of the shaft of pure impartible light of
   unity which this spirit is rather than itself when it is reduced to
   nothing but «fche same. We call the unity naught because mind has no
   notion what it is ; what the mind does know is that it is upheld by
   another than itself. Its upholder then is aught rather than naught,
   though mind has no idea what it can be. It is more real to him than his
   own self in that it belies his personal naught. For mind, as actually
   dwelling there, loses every means of divine nature, which to him is all
   things. He loses his individual nature and yet he does not die ; he
   wins the nature of divinity although not God by nature but by grace.
   Now remember, he is something created out of naught. Yet he, a mere
   created wight, is drawn by the power of God's essence into his unity, a
   thing unknown in anywise to any creature. This unity which is in nowise
   creaturely is poverty, for it is poor of creatures, its content being
   that of simple actuality. This modeless creature-essence is the being
   of the Persons who alone contain it in its most primitive and simple
   form as their nature. This knowledge de-ments the mind. This spiritual
   dementia means the absolute modelessness of the unity which the Persons
   have in actual mode. The spirit broods in

   sameness without light or darkness. Sans light, in its impene- trable
   actuality ; sans darkness in its lack of any special name. The spirit
   free from matter and from form has taken on the form of God. Thus the
   mind attains to its eternal image which is one in its essential nature
   and threefold as uttered in the Persons. Though the spirit in this
   image has an eternal nature of its own yet in itself it is a thing
   created. This created thing is mens ; by mens being meant the spark,
   the living principle of spiritr This is the spirit in itself. Its
   eternal image is another ; that is really God. When the spirit in
   itself turns from all things becoming into the not-becoming of its
   eternal object in the Persons, whence it comes, then the mind is said
   to return to its exemplar. Then void shines into void : the purified
   becomingness of mind turns to the pure not-becoming nature of its
   eternal idea. In this embrace is consummated that exalted union wherein
   at length the spirit at one with all its nature is in divine atonement.
   Where these two meet in one, equally spirit and not-spirit, there is
   beatitude.

   Now consider what the spirit of God means. The most signi- ficant and
   subtile word that creature can employ is spirit (breath or ghost) and
   that is why we call God spirit. But creature has no proper name for the
   nameless God and therefore to our mind God is not spirit.

   Mark too the meaning of spirituality of soul. It means that, aloof from
   the coil of nether things, she is living at her summit in thought and
   love. Here she is one spirit with God. Spirituality of soul, besides,
   means that in her aught she is no more material than in her naught
   wherefrom she was created. Such is the spiritual nature of the soul.
   But she is de-spirited (de-mented) when, at her absorption, she is what
   is his rather than lier own, and this is the perfection of her sanity.
   The interior spiration of God, again, is his hidden nature, the quarry
   of the mind which it escapes ; for tjiis mysterious and silent one lies
   hid in depths of stillness that no creature ever plumbs. This being is
   beyond our grasp, whereat, rejoicing greatly, let us hasten to seize it
   with itself ; this is our highest happiness. So be it, by thy help, O
   divine Trinity. Amen.

   THE FLOW INTO THE FATHER

   Concerning the flow into the Father, note as follows.

   The Godhead is contained in the Father as nature, wherefore ' See
   Spamor's Texte, B. 2, from which the words in brackets are taken.

   he is omnipotent and receives naught from aught that he is not himself
   in his divine potentiality, seeing that he has it in him in essence, as
   his own. Nevertheless, speaking of the Father we mean the Person of the
   Father, and speaking of the Godhead we mean his nature, his impartible
   substance, that is to say. Now since this nature stays brooding in
   settled immoveable stillness, moving all things which have proceeded in
   eternity in the word of his power (or potential Word), it follows that,
   as power, it has ever been flowing into the Father making him able to
   beget a Son like unto himself. We can prove it thus. The Persons are
   impotent as Persons ; anything they do is done in virtue of their
   nature which is their real being. So much for the flow into the Father
   which he has of his own nature wherein he is omnipotent.

   Now mark* The soul has received two powers by nature. The first of
   these powers is understanding. This comprehends the Trinity, although
   it is incomprehensible, and all its works. Observe how understanding
   comprehends the Trinity, and all its works, despite its being
   incomprehensible. The soul in her understanding is the image of the Son
   and the Son is the Father's understanding. So when the soul is empty of
   her own understanding, and only the Son is her understanding, she
   understands with the Son the Son and the Father and their common
   Spirit. That is how the soul comprehends the Trinity and all its works.

   Her other power is will. It is its nature to cast itself into the
   unknown which is God. God is said to be unknown because no creature
   knows him as he knows himself ; as known to himself he is unknowing to
   all creatures. Hence we call God agnosia. Now the chief power of the
   soul is too fastidious to dally with temporal, known things, so free
   will boldly disregards the known and cleaves to what it knows not. As
   St Paul says, I know not; God knoweth.'

   Christ says, When I am ascended I will draw all things to me.' He means
   that when he dawns upon our heart artd understanding he gathers us up
   into himself. In this sense all creatures are one man and that man is
   God. [In this sense man is all things. For he has the nature of all
   creatures, and souls joined to Christ are in this sense one man with
   him. He is the head and they are his members, who are in his charity.]
   In Christ his all was assembled into one. His higher and his lower
   faculties, and the senses of his outward and his inward man were in
   harmonious union with his highest power, conceived there by divine
   conception, which was united with him in one Person. And so with the
   man in whom all creatures end, in whom all multitudinous things have
   been reduced to one in Christ : man is then one in God with Christ's
   humanity. Thus all creatures are one man and that man is God

   in Christ's Person. As one master says : With Gk)d one spirit and with
   Christ one body, that is unity indeed.

   With the powers received from the Trinity the soul knows the ordering
   of all things ordained by God in such exalted fashion. But those that
   turn away their eyes from God relapse into the self- same naught
   wherein they were before they had received the likeness of the Trinity,
   this likeness of the Trinity aye informing them of the dark nothing
   back to which they wend. In this darkness gather all the pangs of hell.
   The dark enwraps them and hides the sight of God ; it burns them past
   soothing by their created aught. This is bitter to their conscience
   which damns them to all time. In this pit of nothingness they sink for
   evermore, powerless to grasp the naught they were before they had the
   likeness of the Trinity.

   And now, my children, let us examine these dark sayings carefully. You
   will see the obvious meaning of these damned. But another, ghostly,
   sense lies hid therein, which it behoves you to note specially. This
   applies to the elect who turn away their mind from God and How back
   into that same naught, for when the soul is carried by her
   understanding above all things and beyond the scope of her own
   understanding to the understanding of the sovran good she secs that to
   all creatures this is unintelligible. So down she goes with her own
   understanding.

   The fastidious soul can rest her understanding on nothing that has
   name. She escapes from every name into the nameless nothing- ness.
   Escaping her own nature she falls clear of her own aught. The naught
   she falls into is the unknowing, which is called the dark. In this dark
   gather the pangs of hell,' where the soul is plynged sheer into the
   void. This only happens when she is perfectly devoid of knowledge. The
   slightest trace of knowledge or under- standing of the naught that she
   is plunged in would be hell- torment to her. All sense and knowledge of
   the naught ends in this darkness. The darkness burns them past salving
   by any of their kind. Bitter is this conscience which damns them to all
   time. In this abyss of nothingness they sink for evermore, failing to
   grasp the naught they were before they took the likeness of the
   Trinity.' By virtue whereof they have their being. To approfound the
   naught wherein they drown they are as helpless as they were when they

   For this darkness is the incom- prehensible nature of God. She sinks
   for evermore in the depths of this naught. She sinks and drowns ; she
   drowns to her own aught. Her aught, surviving, sinks as naught to
   naught. But the naught that sinks can never comprehend the naught it
   sinks in. Every virtue mastered and transcended, the soul cries ; Even

   so I cannot glorify and love God to the full. I die then to the virtues
   casting me into the naught of the Godhead to sink eternally from naught
   to aught,' The highest meed of love and praise the soul can lavish on
   the sovran good is given in the knowledge that all her love and praise
   fall short of God. So down she goes through the little she can call her
   own and dying to her virtues is cast into the naught of her own self.

   Two points mark here. She casts herself with the naught of herself
   when, self-bereft of her exalted power she ever regards her own
   insignificance.

   The other naught she plunges in is the naught of the Godhead. Seeing
   that she herself is naught and not disposed to stay at aught, the soul
   casts herself into the naught of the Godhead and so comes with naught
   to naught. She wants the aught she recognises in herself to perish in
   the naught which is its very aught and so subsist in unity. She sees we
   cannot love and glorify God better than by recognising how inadequate
   all love and glory are. Wherefore she holds her peace. St Dionysius
   being bent on lauding Mary's virtues found them so inconceivable he
   held his tongue. By his dumbness the worthy Dionysius did Mary highest
   honour. Thus it befalls the soul on being ravished into God's
   incomprehensibility. Her lips struck dumb, O groundless Truth,' she
   cries, how paltry is our praise ! ' So she attains to union close
   enough for God to pour himself into her every whit and snatch her every
   whit into himself, leaving no trace of either vice or virtue ; nor does
   the soul know any difference.

   Fo^ you must know that to the soul in her perfection goodness would
   con\e quite natural ; she would not merely practise virtues, but virtue
   as a whole would be her life and she would radiate it naturally. We
   seem to be vicious or virtuous from being now the one and now the
   other. This should not be : we ought to be always in a state of
   perfection. That is one thing to note.

   Further, God absorbs the soul, leaving no trace. This means that the
   soul ravished by God into the peace and quiet of his secret self makes
   little show save to her kind. There the soul knows no separation, for
   he who has absorbed her has merged her in himself. She well knows that
   she is but knows not what she is. -- The sun in certain countries is
   too hot for fruits to flourish on the surface of earth, but, on the
   other hand, the sun produces gold in plenty in the bowels of earth. And
   .so with the soul in whom the bright sun of the divine nature shines :
   it produces its like there, scattering the darkness and bringing about
   perfect unity. Look you,* it behoves us to be very merciful to these,
   for, withdrawn into his hiding, they are out of touch with the profane.

   St Chrysostom says, It is not yet manifest what we are, but when we are
   changed into him we shall show what we are.' What- ever she may take
   herself for, to God she is creature.

   The Godhead is a spiritual substance, so impenetrable that none can say
   what manner of thing it is. They say ; God in the Trinity is the living
   light in its visible radiance. In other words, the three Persons are
   but one in nature though distinct in Person in the same sense that the
   source of light is not the light nor is the source its shine. Applying
   this to the three Persons, the source is the Father, the Son is the
   light and the Holy Ghost is the shine. The Father is the living source
   in whom all things have lived eternally without themselves as in their
   cause. The light is the Son in whom all things appear eternally as in
   their idea. The shine is the Holy Ghost in whom all things are one
   eternally as in their naught. Not that one Person is the life and
   another the light : the three Persons are one life, one light.

   The Trinity is the heart of the divine nature. As you may prove. For in
   human life it is the heart which beats in all the limbs, energising,
   co-ordinating them. Because the limbs receive from it, therefore it is
   called the heart. Now touching the God- head, this is not active in its
   nature, but anything it does it does with the Persons, and the Trinity
   is called the heart of divine nature because this works by means of it,
   and because it (the Trinity) is the origin of all things and all things
   flow back into it and end. This heart's heart, again, is the paramount
   power of the unity wherein and whereby it is omnipotent. Human nature
   Hows in love into the Trinity as into its universal origin. The unity
   of the Trinity is bottomless and nothing is contained therein. In the
   embrace of unity the naked soul sinks down for aye nor ever touches
   bottom. Her temporalities (i.e. the created natures of her powers) stop
   at the Persons, whereas her pure essence is received by the pure unity
   of God without return.

   Behold the soul divorced from every aught. For he who stoops to aught
   that is not God can never be received into God's unity. This unity is
   causeless ; it is self-caused. Of bottomless depth the floor, of
   endless height the roof, of boundless space the rim. I refer to the
   Trinity of Persons : the unity underlies it, holding it together ; it
   overtops it, energising it ; it surrounds it, ending its distinctions.
   Thus the Trinity is in the unity and the unity in the Trinity. As saith
   the psalm Quicumque vult.

   That we should know ourselves and God so far as we are able, that is
   God's will. If we would know ourselves we have to recog- nise that we
   are nothing but the raw material of God for the blessed Trinity to work
   in. It behoves us therefore to be vastly careful not to hamper in any
   way the work which the exalted

   workman designs to carry out in us to his glory, but so to maintain
   ourselves that the material is always ready for the workman to do his
   work in us. St Paul says, The spirit of the Lord descends from on high
   in secret, working in whom it will and when and where and how it will
   in him in whom it meets no hindrance.' In the children of God. They are
   led by this spirit. -- It is thus ye shall know yourselves. Next, we
   have to know God. To this St Dionysius exhorted one of his disciples,
   saying, Up, friend, divest thyself of things and put off thyself that
   thou mayst under- stand the Sovran Good.' Of it three things are
   predicated. First, it is a unique force entire in everything ; next, a
   unique good embracing everything. (Thirdly) to know God really ye must
   know him as the unknown. So Dionysius says.

   God's will is our 'welfare, and our welfare eonsists in knowing God and
   doing accordingly. Here timorousness mutters in the soul, both she will
   and she will not. And hard on this comes rage of soul. When she divines
   that it remains for her to be somewhat that he is not, she is
   transported with ire. She would sooner come to naught than have or take
   aught that belongs to him. Lord,' she cries, my welfare lies in thy
   never calling me to mind ; and forbid, I pray thee, any creature ever
   to console me. I rejoice that my powers never come before thy face.'

   See what the soul means by her strange words : my welfare lies in thy
   never calling me to mind.' She wots right well that she has never been
   one instant out of his mind and that is her felicity. She begs not to
   be comforted by any creature, because she is in indigence right
   comfortless where her disconsolateness is her one consolation. And when
   she says her powers come not before his face ? Observe what God's face
   is. We sec ourselves best in what is called our face. So too where God
   is manifest to himself in the mysterious stillness of his own essence.
   This revelation is called the face of the Godhead. The soul is well
   aware that, accompanied by her powers, she can never enter the absolute
   stillness where he is manifest to himself. Hence she desires her pdwers
   not to come before his face, t.e. his self-revelation. See, her powers
   halt at its reflection in the Trinity and only the pure essence of her
   spirit is flashed from the stillness of her own power straight into
   this perfect revelation. As a master says : Where pure and purified are
   one the powers of the soul are at an end.' Meaning that in the one
   perfect nature the pure nature of the spirit transcends all its powers.
   St Paul says, He who is joined to God is one spirit with him.' Amen.

   ST JOHN SAYS, I SAW THE WORD IN GOD'

   St John says, I saw the Word in God.' God is abstract being, pure
   perception, which is perceiving itself in itself. St John means that
   the Son is in the Father, in his nature. I saw the Word with God.' Here
   he is referring to the intellect which, flowing into God eternally,
   proceeded forth from God in distinction of Person, namely, the Son. * I
   saw the Word before God.' This means that the Son is ever being born of
   the Father and that he is the image of the Father. In the Word there is
   only the Word,' refers to the eternal emanation of creatures in the
   Word. I saw the Word under God ' ; the Son become man, as God said, I
   have loved you in the reflection of my darkness.' God's dark- ness is
   his nature which is unknowable. Good people know it not and no creature
   can divine it ; therefore it is a darkness. While God was flowing in
   his own darkness the Son was not distinct from him. In the darkness of
   his nature the Father flowed as Person so far as he was pregnant. The
   Father gave his Son birth and gave him his own nature ; he gave him not
   his Person : his nature he can give away but he can give to none his
   Person for that is the product of his unborn essence. The Father spoke
   himself and all creatures in his Son ; the Father spoke himself to all
   creatures in his Son. The Father turning back into himself speaks
   himself in himself ; he flows back into himself with all creatures. As
   Dionysius says, God proceeded into himself,' mean- ing that his hidden
   nature suffices him, which is concealeci from creatures. The soul
   cannot follow him into his nature, except he absorb her altogether, and
   then in him she is made dark of all created lights. The darkness of
   creatures is their incomprehensibility in their simple nature, that is,
   in the nothing from which they were created. In this uncreated light
   they discern his uncreatedness. Into his uncreatedness they flow in the
   reflection of his darkness.

   -- Tell me, good Sir, do Father, Son and Holy Ghost speak the same word
   in the Godhead or has each a different word ? ' -- In the Godhead there
   is but one word ; in it the Father in the Godhead speaks into his
   unborn essence and into his born essence, the Father flowing into his
   Son with all that he is and the Son speaks the same word, and the
   Father and the Son flow into the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost speaks
   the same word. They speak this one simple word in their essence and
   each speaks the same word in his own Person, and in their common nature
   they discourse the truth and the Persons receive the essence as it is
   essentially. Yet the Persons receive from one another. They bow down to

   the essence in praise, lauding the essence ; and the unborn essence
   pronounces its unborn word in the Persons, lauding the Persons^ and the
   Persons receive the essence every whit and pass it on to one another.
   This unborn essence is self-sufficient, without birth and without
   activity. Birth and activity are in the Persons^ The Persons say they
   are the truth and that creatures have none of the truth. When the soul
   attains to this divine speech she speaks this very truth and is the
   Deity to every creature as well as to herself. This comes of her
   indivisible nature and therein creatures are a matter of the will. The
   bad are bad and the good good, the Persons preserving justice in the
   Godhead. They give tjie bad their due and the good theirs.

   St Dionysius says, God is the Prime Cause, and God has fashioned all
   things for himself who is the cause of all ; and his works arc all
   wrought in the likeness of the First Cause.' Father and Son show forth
   the first cause, and the Son is playing in the Father with all things
   for he proceeded forth from him. The Son plays before Father with all
   things, the Son plays below the Father with all things. The Father
   begat the Son with his Godhead and with all things. The Father begat
   his Son in his Godhead with all things. The Father begat his Son into
   his Godhead with all things. The Godhead is the several Persons and the
   fullness of the Persons. The Godhead is not given to any thing. On
   coming to its knowledge the soul sees God and glancing back into
   herself she sees that the Godhead is in all things. Receiving into her
   the likeness of the creator she creates what she will but cannot give
   it essence : she gives it form and is herself its matter and its
   eternal activities are in her ; these are in the eternal birth. Its
   temporal activities are in time, where God gives his works essence,
   form and matter out of nothing, which the soul is unable to do ; God
   reduces his works to the unity of Christ and this order shall not pass
   away but shall be raised up to the glory of the one. Soul, transcending
   order, enters the naked Godhead where she is seen when God is seen in
   the soul as God. This soul has God as God in her, she has gotten in her
   the image of her creator.

   Now mark the difference between the work of God and creature. God has
   done all things for himself, for he is the universal cause and all his
   works are wrought in the likeness of the first cause and creatures all
   work according to the likeness of the first cause. That is the
   intention they have towards God. v God made all things from nothing,
   infusing into them his Godhead so that all things are full of God. Were
   they not full of the Godhead they would all perish. The Trinity does
   all the work in things and creatures exploit the power of the Trinity,
   creatures working as creatures and God as God, while man mars the work
   so far as his intention is

   evil. When a man is at work his body and soul are united, for body
   cannot act without the soul. When the soul is united with God she does
   divine work, for God cannot work without the soul and the soul cannot
   work without God. God is the soul's life just as the soul is the
   body's, and the Godhead is the soul of the three Persons in that it
   unifies them and in that it has dwelt in them for ever. And since the
   Godhead is in all things it is all soul's soul. But in spite of its
   being all soul's soul, the Godhead is not creatures' soul in the way it
   is the Trinity's. God does one work with the soul ; in this work the
   soul is raised above herself. The work is creature, grace to wit, which
   bears the soul to God. It is nobler than the soul as admitting her to
   God ; but the soul is the nobler in her admissibility. This creature
   which has neither form nor matter nor any being of its own, translates
   the soul out of her natural state into the supernatural.

   To his eternally elect God gives his spirit as it is, without means ;
   they cannot miss it. Creatures God is going to make at his good
   pleasure he has known eternally as creatures, for in God they arc
   creatures albeit nothing in themselves : they are uncreated creatures.
   Creatures are always more noble in God than they are in themselves. In
   God the soul shall see her own perfection without image and shall see
   the difference between things un- created and created and she shall
   distinguish God from Godhead, nature from Person, form from matter. The
   Father is the begin- ning of the Godhead, he is the well-spring in the
   Godhead, over- flowing into all things in eternity and time. The
   Godhead is a heaven of three Persons. The Father is God and a Person
   not born nor proceeding from any ; and the Son is God and a Iverson and
   born of the Father ; and the Holy Ghost is God and a Person proceeding
   from both. St Paul speaks of the uncreated spirit flowing into the
   created spirit (or mind). This meeting which befalls the created spirit
   is her saving revelation ; it happens in the soul who breaks through
   the boundaries of God to lose herself in his uncreated naught. The
   three Persons are one God, one in nature, and our nature is shadowing
   God's nature in perpetual motion ; having followed him from naught to
   aught and into that which God is to himself, there she has no motion of
   her naught. Aught is suspended from the divine essence; its progression
   is matter, wherein the soul puts on new forms and puts off her old
   ones. The change from one into the other is her death : the one she
   doffs she dies to, and the one she dons she lives in.

   St John says, Blessed arc the dead that die in God : they are buried
   where Christ is buried.' Upon which St Dionysius com- ments thus :
   Burial in God is the passage into uncreated life. The power the soul
   goes in is her matter, which power the soul

   can never approfound for it is God and God is changeless, albeit the
   soul changes in his power. As St Dionysius says, God is the mover of
   the soul.' Now form is a revelation of essence. St Dionysius says, Form
   is matter's aught. Matter without form is naught.' So the soul never
   rests till she is gotten into God who is her first form and creatures
   never rest till they have gotten into human nature : therein do they
   attain to their original form, God namely. As St Dionysius hath it, God
   is the beginning and the middle and the end of all things.'

   Then up and spake the loving soul, Lord, when enjoyest thou thy
   creatures ? ' -- That do I at high noon when God is reposing in all
   creatures and all creatures in God.' St Augustine says, All things are
   God,' meaning, they have always been in God and shall return to God. So
   when St Dionysius says, All things are naught,' he means they are not
   of themselves and that in their egress and their ingress they are as
   ineomprehensible as naught. When St Augustine says, God is all things,'
   he means he has the power of all things, one more noble than he ever
   gave to creatures. And St Dionysius* dictum, God is naught,' implies
   that God is as inconceivable as naught. As King David sings, God has
   assigned to everything its place : to fish the water, birds the air and
   beasts the field and to the soul the Godhead.' The soul must die in
   every form save God : there at her journey's end her matter rests and
   God absorbs the whole of the powers ol' the soul, so now behold the
   soul a naked spirit. Then, as St Dionysius says, the soul is not called
   soul, she is the sovran power of God wherewith God's will is done. It
   is at this point St Augus- tine cfies, Lord thou hast bereft me of my
   spirit ! ' Whereupon Origen remarks, Thou art mistaken, O Augustine. It
   is not thy spirit, it is thy soul-powers that are taken from thee.' The
   soul unites with God like food with man, which turns in eye to eye, in
   ear to ear. So does the soul in God turn into God ; com- bining with
   each divine power she is that power in God ; and God combines with the
   soul and is each power in the soul ; and the two natures flowing in one
   light, the soul comes utterly to naught. That she is she is in God. The
   divine powers swallow her up out of sight just as the sun draws up
   things out of sight.

   What God is to himself no man may know. God is in all things,
   self-intent. God is all in all and to each thing all things at once.
   And the soul shall be the same. What God has by nature is the soul's by
   grace. God is nothing at all to anything ; God is nothing at all to
   himself, God is nothing that we can express. In this sense Dionysius
   says, God is all things to himself for he bears the form of all
   things.' He is big with himself in a naught : there all things are God,
   and are not, the same as we were. When we

   were not then God was heaven and hell and all things* St Diony- sius
   says that God is not meaning that he bears himself in a not^ namely,
   the not-knowing of all creatures, and this not draws the soul through
   all things, over all things and out of all things into that superlative
   not where she is not-known to any creature. There she is not, has not,
   wills not, she has albandoned God and everything to God. Now God and
   heaven gone, the soul is finally cut off from every influx of divinity,
   so his spirit is no longer given to her. Arrived at this the soul
   belongs to the eternal life rather than creation ; her uncreated spirit
   lives rather than herself : the uncreated, eternally-existent which is
   no less than God. Wherewith being all-pervaded to the total loss of her
   own self, the soul at length returns without herself to eternal
   indigence, for what is left alive in her is nothing less than God. Thus
   she is poor of self. This is the point where soul and Godhead part and
   the losing of the Godhead is the finding of the soul, for the spirit
   which is uncreated drawing on the soul to its own knowledge she comes
   nearer to the not- being of the Godhead than by knowing all the Father
   ever gave. [The gift of the Father is the positive existence of all
   creatures in the Person of his Son and with the Son the Holy Ghost as
   well. For the Persons must be looked on as inseparate, albeit distinct
   illuminations of the understanding.] And so far as she attains this in
   the body she enjoys the eternal wont and escapes her own.

   We ought to be eternally as poor as when we were not and then our
   kingdom shall not pass away, abiding as it does in God whose it is
   eternally. The Godhead gave all things up to God ; it is as poor, as
   naked and as idle as though it were not : it has not, wills not, wants
   not, works not, gets not. St Dionysius says,

   Be the soul never so bare the Godhead is barer ' : a naught from which
   no shoot was ever lopped nor ever shall be. It is this counsel of
   perfection the soul is straining after more than after anything that
   God contains or anything she can conceive of God. Saith the bride in
   the Book of Love, The form of my beloved passed by me and I cannot
   overtake him.' It is God who has the treasure and the bride in him, the
   Godhead is as void as though it were not. God has consumed the form of
   the soul and formed her with his form into his form. Now she gets all
   things free from matter, as their creator possesses them in him, and
   resigns the same to God.

   Ours to contain all things in the same perfection wherein the eternal
   wisdom has eternally contained them. Ours to expire them as the Holy
   Ghost has expired them eternally. Ours to be all things' spirit and all
   things' spirit to us in the spirit. Ours to know all and deify
   ourselves with all. Ours to be God by grace

   as God is God by nature ; ours to resign the same to God and be as poor
   as when we were not. In this state we are as free as when we were not :
   free as the Godhead in its non-existence. Christ says, * Blessed are
   the poor in spirit.' These same poor in spirit enjoy the Father without
   let or hindrance. The Father knows no difference between this soul and
   him save that he has by nature what she has by grace. For as Christ
   declares, Them that follow me I will bring to where I am.' Blessed are
   the poor in spirit ; God's kingdom is in them.' These spiritual poor
   are those who have abandoned everything to God as he possessed them
   when we were not and the naught itself. In this naught dwells God and
   in God dwells this soul. There she has no dwelling and thereinto no
   creature can get in its own right and no creature can go higher.

   XV

   THE THREE CREATIONS

   The three Persons made creatures out of nothing to enjoy the uses of
   the blessed Trinity. There is difference of wont in the Persons and
   their powers ; for the essence being self-sufficient there is nothing
   in the essence to enjoy excepting unity, so the soul demands nothing,
   knows nothing, wills nothing.

   As to the Persons, the one knows the others so far as they are Persons,
   for one Person begets the others. Essence begets not. In the domain of
   Person, one is receiving from another. The Son receives all he
   possesses from the Father ; the Holy Ghost receives all he» possesses
   from the JFather and the Son, and each of the Persons receives from the
   ' others presence and well-being and co-operation and mutual delight.
   As to their activity, each one finds itself entire as essence in the
   others and each enjoys the others as Persons and itself in both the
   others.

   We speak of three creations. Birth is called creation, and being made
   from nothing, and being raised in grace to higher grace. The same
   applies especially to Christ. If birth is a creation then Christ was
   the creature of his Father in his eternal birth of Person and of
   nature. Christ himself declared, Wisdom created wisdom.' The creation
   of the Son has ever been to him his whole existence, who is still being
   born of the Father eternally with all that he is, and this birth
   remains in the Father eternally. St Dionysius says, ^God created a God
   as good as God.' Inasmuch as the Father conceives himself of himself he
   is his own creation. As St Dionysius says, God is his own self-begotten
   Son.' In eternity, that is. Creatures abide in eternity as being in the
   God-bearing Godhead. The Son knows all things essentially in the

   TRACTATES 8g8

   essence of the Father who, essentially, has the potentiality of all
   things that shall happen and shall not happen. He has in his Person the
   universal image, so that he knows all things in common with the Father
   and wields joint power over what has happened, what is happening and
   what is still to happen, as well as over what God could do an he would
   that never happens. As the Father stretches his will to things that are
   to happen so the Son stretches his wisdom to effect their happening ;
   and as the Father directs his will towards things that shall not
   happen, the Son directs his wisdom to prevent them happening.

   The second creation is that of all the three Persons at once who are
   one in their work of making all things from nothing. This applies
   pre-eminently to Christ's soul, for she was created from nothing in
   time. The images existing in the middle Person are imprinted in his
   soul's potentiality so that she knows ideally, all things past, present
   and to come. But things that are not going to happen, things which God
   in his omnipotence could do but which will not take place, albeit
   possible essentially, these his soul does not know for that belongs to
   God alone. This light is creature, created from nothing and is
   supernatural to the soul. His soul has one light in common with the
   angels. This is the image impressed in her wherein she perceives in
   herself things that have happened and are happening ; but in this image
   she sees nothing of those things which are going to happen except God
   grant her knowledge of them. And this is supernatural to the soul.

   The third creation is the raising of his body from grace to higher
   grace, that is, something extra to his animal nature, fei his animal
   nature he cannot see into peoples' consciousness ; in his animal nature
   he could give no sign nor know about the future unless God granted it.
   Christ was so foolish as a child he did not know his father or his
   mother. St Ambrose says ; He was created from grace to higher grace
   when he rose from death to immortality.' Christ sees in heaven, with
   his fleshly eyes, only what is before him ; he must turn round to see
   what is behind him. So the Son has never known the Father in that
   funda- mental mode wherein the Three are united in one nature. That
   mode Christ's soul was sharing when, at the moment of her creation she
   was bereft of it and prevented from seeing her divine nature, Christ's
   soul enjoys divine nature by grace as God does by nature. This is so
   far removed from creature that never a drop has ever leaked into any
   creature. The furthest limit of man's knowledge is an intuition of how
   the three Persons enjoy their divine nature. To this none can attain
   unless his soul is plunged into the consciousness of the created and
   uncreated

   natures confluent in her where she stands in the midst and, seeing
   straight into them both, has at that point pure intuition of her wont
   and how what she enjoys there is withdrawn from her and how, though
   borne along with and by grace, she is still unable to apprehend God's
   nature. She clearly sees that she is God's and not her own at all. She
   is acutely sensible that enjoying and suffering are identical. That
   Christ should have action and passion both in one, bodily, that was the
   wonder. His soul must have suffered in all her powers. Her highest
   power suffering as much more than the rest as it was more capable of
   suffering. One wise doctor says, In this intuition the soul has perfect
   joy, for perfect joy is perfect knowledge.* Christ says, They that know
   thee Father and thy Son whom thou hast sent, have life eternal.' Also
   he says, * Pray, that your joy may be full.' St Dionysius says,
   fullness of joy is perfect consciousness, a balanced interchange of
   nature, whereby the soul beholds herself in the mirror of the Godhead.
   God is the mirror, unveiled to whom he will and veiled from whom he
   will. St Peter says, God fashioned his nature and the Persons in that
   nature and chose the nature not the Persons.' St Dionysius says the
   soul has a light that lights her to work. By the light God casts on the
   angels next him they cast themselves back into God with all they are.
   As St Bernard observes, Minds do not flow back into God in their
   natural light ; the Godhead absorbs them in its own light without their
   seeing.* Now St John says, God is love, and he who dwells in love
   dwells in God and God in him.' When God reveals himself to the soul and
   the soul loves God, she is in God and God is incher. When the sun
   shines and the eye sees it, the eye is in the sun and the sun is in the
   eye. Well then, friend mine, here you have the notion, which it defies
   me to express in words, for the divine nature in the Persons is a
   mirror, beyond the reach of any word. In so far as the soul can project
   herself beyond words so far she approaches that mirror. In that mirror
   the union is simply onh of likeness.

   When, Lord, I was in thee I was unnecessitous in my nothing- ness ; it
   was thy look, thy notice of me, that made me indigent. If it be death
   for the soul to part from God, then it is death to her to emanate from
   God. All change is a dying. Wherefore we die from time to time and the
   soul dies all-dying in the wonder of the Godhead, impotently grasping
   at the divine nature. In the naught she is undone and comes to nothing.
   In this not-being she is buried, in un-knowing she is merged in the
   unknown, in unthinking merged in the unthought-of, in un-love one with
   the unloved. Death's grip none can unloose ; it severs life from limb
   and the soul from God and casts her into the Godhead

   wherein, sepultured, she is ignored by every creature. She is forgotten
   as one changed within the tomb nor is she held in any man's embrace.
   She like God is incomprehensible. For the dead who have died in the
   Godhead are beyond our ken, like the dead are who die here to the body.
   That death is the soul's eternal quest. Slain in the three Persons she
   loses her naught and is hurled into the Godhead. Where she discovers
   the face of her naught. Thou art all fair my love, there is no spot in
   thee,' says our Lord ; and of his incomprehensible beauty she declares,
   Thou art more fair.' There she sees the secret art of God : how
   marvelloiisly God contrived that nothing should be indigent, yet
   without detriment thereto. St Dionysius says : No wonder God made the
   soul indigent with a look, when tlie sun, unbidden, gives life to mites
   and worms in rotten wood.' The soul, perceiving God's immensity and her
   own insignificance, easts herself out of God's heart and out of all
   creatures and rests upon her naked nothingness : the divine power has
   her in its keeping. As St Dionysius says : All things are naught at the
   command of God.' Again he says : The look which goes from God into the
   soul is the beginning of faith whereby I believe things not revealed to
   me.' So far as the soul sinks down in feith into the unknown good, so
   far she is one with the unknown good and is unknown to self or any
   creature. She well knows that she is but knows not what she is. Not
   till she knows all that there is to know does she cross over to the
   unknown good. This crossing is obscure to many a religious.

   The nature of the soul is such that where she is at all there she is
   altogether. She is entire in every limb, for where her natpre is at all
   there it is wholly. So is the Godhead in all places and in all
   creatures and in each wholly.

   Unnatured nature is natured only so far as it is natureable. It natures
   not itself but the Father natures his Son in natured nature, for the
   Father is as much natured as unnatured nature, seeing that it is one
   with him. The Father is alone in unnatured nature and is the first in
   natured nature. And in natured nature the Son is naturing with the
   Father, for (Father) and Son nature the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
   exists with the Father and the Son in natured nature and natures not.
   In (un)&gt;natured nature they are one, natured nature distinguishing
   the Persons ; and the Persons are as eternal in their Persons as the
   unnatured nature in its nature and their natured nature is as eternal
   in them as their unnatured nature, and this is nothing else than one
   God in three Persons^ who nature creatures, each in its own nature, and
   give them the power and activity that is best suited to them. So dear
   each creature holds its nature that it would have no other.

   A master says, If sorrow could befall the Father he would rue his
   inability to make all things divine by nature.' When the soul in her
   simple nature turns into God's nature forthwith she is made one with
   God, but to heed discrete powers and persons and virtues hampers the
   soul's divine unity. Her common sense endows the other senses with
   sight, hearing, touch and savour, albeit in itself no more than one.
   And the perceptions of the outward senses are all referred to common
   sense. Discursive reason sorts out what is good and, leaving out the
   animal and gross, presents it to the memory for union with the soul.
   Her highest power introduces it to her understanding which has
   intuition of God's will, and so it is conveyed into the soul who
   harmonises all with God's good will.

   God in himself is simple good and undivided. The names the soul gives
   God are taken from herself. Albeit threefold in his Person, God is the
   one and only good by nature. He is omni- potent good in the Father,
   clear wisdom in the Son and pure goodness in the Holy Ghost. He is
   threefold and he is one in creatures generally ; and of those burning
   spirits who are con- sumed in the fire and brought to naught in him he
   is the impartible substance. When, having harmonised all things in
   herself, the soul is reduced to her impartible substance, then she
   inhales the powers of the divine nature and exhales them from her being
   into the being of the divine nature which permeates her throughly, the
   two beings meeting in one point which is common to the soul and God and
   the variety of Persons hinders not their unity nor does their nature
   interfere with the variety of Persons. He is threefold and one in every
   Person in his born and unborn natures severally and the Persons are not
   admitted to the essence. To receive one Person is to receive the divine
   nature threefold in its unity. For one Person in essence is as good as
   three distinct.

   Happy the soul who, taking this transcendental flight, receives all
   things in the naked Godhead. That soul is buried in the face of God ;
   she is rapt into heaven wherein the three Persons dwell in the oneness
   of their nature. This is the hidden Godhead whereof no man can speak.
   Blessed are they who make this passover : all things are known to them
   in truth and they themselves unknown to any creature. So far as they
   are above creatures they are God and super-creaturely, owing to their
   unity with God. God's face conceals them, every shadow of them, in
   itself. Where two unite, the stronger draws the weaker to it. Christ
   says, Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you.' Blessed are the
   chosen, they bear God's image. Christ says, Blessed are the poor in
   spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God.' The poor in spirit are those
   who have abandoned all to God as

   he possessed them when we were not. God's kingdom means the soul being
   full of God and nothing of herself. In this nothing God dwells and the
   soul dwells in the same nothing. There she changes not and thereinto no
   creature can get in its own right, and creature can rise no higher. St
   Dionysius says, God dwells in the nothing.' O Dionysius, that is not
   enough ! God dwells in the nothing-at- all that was prior to nothing,
   in the hidden Godhead of pure gnosis whereof no man durst speak. Unity
   is of God alone. As St Dionysius says : Did God not dwell in the naught
   things would all perish.' St Dionysius, that is not enough I Did God
   not dwell in the nothing-at-all sustaining creatures with his might,
   they would all come to nothing for they by nature pass away into the
   nothingness from which they were created. There- fore God dwells in the
   nothing-at-all that was prior to nothing.

   Creature has access to God, who is her being, energising in the power
   which moves her to rise from naught to aught. Now St Paul asks, and
   Augustine too, How did I get from naught to aught, from worm to God,
   from creature to creator ? ' The soul shall be so one with God she
   weens that nothing is save God alone and that God made no creature save
   herself alone. The soul that makes this transcendental passage enters
   the universal peace. She is God as he is in himself. Christ says, I
   have been man for you and if ye are not God for me ye wrong me.' God
   became man that we might become God. God in his God-nature lay hid in
   human nature so that we saw naught but man. And so this soul shall hide
   her in God's nature until we can see naught but God ; not putting on a
   Person as Christ did but wholly immersed in the divine nature. God is
   not a nature like a creature is ^hich has some quality another lacks.
   The brewer who is also baker we cannot simply call a brewer for he is
   baker too. God is the nature of each nature : he is all natures' nature
   undivided. He is the light of lights, the life of lives, the being of
   beings, the reason of reasons. He is all natures' common nature. As
   Dionysius says : We cannot say he is a nature seeing that he is
   impartible and there is nothing like him.' And again St Dionysius says
   : We know God only in unknowing.'

   When God enters the soul he comes in with all things. Although in God
   there is but one thing simply, the soul possesses it as separate
   notions, angels and devils and all. The soul is able to conceive all
   things in God and to discern what God is in them and what they are in
   God by soaring up to the supernal simplicity, into unknowing. St
   Dionysius says, That is Lordship, tran- scending earthly things and the
   likes of them and raising them to the heights.' Christ says, Them that
   follow me I will raise to where I am.' The Father speaks himself into
   the soul in his Son.

   Now the Son is the Word of the Father, so the Father reveals to the
   soul in this wise that he is shapeless in his divine nature. The soul,
   speaking herself back to the Father in the selfsame Word, says she has
   no shape either in her naught, so she abandons her naught in the Word
   and plunges shapeless into the unshapen.

   The Godhead is an abstract simple thing, omnipotent above all Person as
   well as having the power of the inseparate three Persons : giving to
   none, receiving from none, save as therein subsisting. St Dionysius
   says, The Godhead has gotten all things.' The three Persons are in the
   Godhead ; they reveal of it to creatures and each other as much as they
   are able to receive. The Father reveals the Godhead to himself and to
   his Son and Father and Son reveal it to the Holy Ghost and the three
   Persons reveal it to creatures and the Godhead wantons with the Word
   and before the Word and above the Word and the Word cannot comprehend
   it. Were the three Persons undistinguished in the Godhead, the Godhead
   would not be revealed at all and creatures would not have been created.
   The eternal activities are the cause of creatures. The Father reveals
   the Godhead, the Son reveals the Father, the Holy Ghost reveals them
   both : This revelation the Godhead gets from things beneath it. The
   supreme perfection is indigent of creatures. So it befalls from time to
   time that when the moon, shooting below the sun, mono})olises all the
   sunlight and the sun is said to be eclipsed, that then a star exerts
   its force upon the moon and drawn it off the sun ; thus the sun owes
   its light to things beneath it.

   The soul gets from the Trinity those finite things commensurate with
   her powers. Out of the naked Godhead there shines into the simple being
   of the soul a single light invisible to her powers, both high and low.
   For though the Godhead has in it all things, it has them all in one,
   not piecemeal. It begets not, so it is not Father ; it receives not, so
   it is not Son nor Holy Ghost. The three Persons are God in person and
   in nature Godhead. The Godhead shines through the distinction of
   Persons and through separate creatures down to the very lowest,
   illuminating them and illuminating itself in itself. And when the soul
   in her naked essence enters into the Godhead, all things are within her
   ken even the meanest creature ; then she illuminates herself and
   everything in her and discerns in the Godhead the divine nature and in
   the variety of Persons she loses her name and the Persons lose their
   names in the unity and everything the unity compre- hends loses its
   name in the unity. And here the soul, as good now as her naught, both
   draw together to their close in the God- head's naught, where her
   powers are useless. As St Diony- sius observes, God passes away.' By
   which he signifies that the

   soul in her naked essence has escaped her powers. Her powers have lost
   their deity, and the pure substance of their deity as well, to the
   Persons and their powers, which powers react upon the essence by
   hindering the swing-back of the Three to unity. Here love loses her
   name and all things in the Godhead's naught, now the soul has flowed
   into her aught. In the Godhead's naught, the Father has his
   consummation and the three Persons their one nature wherein they give
   to creatures the perfection of their created aught and the soul in her
   aught in the Godhead's naught courses through all things all
   undisturbed in her being's aught. As St Dionysius says, The soul is not
   moved in her naught in the Godhead's naught neither does the soul move
   the Godhead in its naught. There she is so great . . ., she flows to
   him as it were in a light.' St Dionysius says, The Godhead has come to
   naught for the powers of the soul cannot comprehend it.'

   Blessed and praised be the Father, Son and Holy Ghost in the unity of
   their divine nature. Blessed and praised be Jesus Christ the Son of the
   living God, one Person of divine nature and human nature.

   THE SOUL'S RAGE

   The soul is furious for self-knowledge. Her face is lit with passion,
   red with rage for the arrears withheld from her in God, because she is
   not all God is by nature, because she has not all God has by nature.

   The masters say there is no fiercer appetite than a fjiiend's desire to
   possess his friend and all that he possesses. The soul proclaims her
   rage so boundless she cannot be appeased by him. The bonds of love are
   all too cruel for her. Alas ! she cries, who shall console me ? My
   misery is too deep. Were I the one creator, beginningless and endless,
   and had I made creatures and were he soul like me, then I would go
   straight out of my estate and let her enter in and be God while I was
   creature ; and if it were an obstacle to God to get his being from me,
   he would be welcome to efface me for I would perish sooner than be a
   hindrance to him. But seeing it is common to everything created to have
   somewhat of the eternal in man's nature ever present in it, therefore I
   know not where to turn to find a place. So I take refuge in myself and
   there I find the lowest place, aye, one more base than hell for even
   thence do my shortcomings hound me. It seems I cannot then escape
   myself. Here I sit me down and herein will I stay. And I beseech thee,
   Lord, that thou never callest me to mind and forbiddest any creature
   ever

   to console me and deniest to my powers that ever any one of them should
   come before thy face, lest I offend thee. So I go out and let the soul
   go in.

   The third rage of the soul is that she should be God and that there
   should not be a single creature, like when God was in his eternity ere
   he created creature, so that she may enjoy God- nature in its
   simplicity as he did before. But then his love were lacking to him, for
   it is the nature of good things to communicate themselves.

   Fourthly, she rages to be absolutely nothing but the naked essence,
   there being neither God nor creature. She asks. What is the good of the
   three Persons in the Godhead and what is the use of creatures ? But
   hold, she cries, except for them there would be no creatures. That must
   be the reason why there are three Persons in the Godhead : they are the
   cause of creatures. God is God-exalted : the creatures he has made
   cannot exalt him. All that creatures do to God is themselves : such
   glory as they can give to God is the same as they are.

   THE TWOFOLD WAY ^

   Ego sum via, veritas et vita, I am the way, the truth and the life,'
   says our Lord Jesus Christ. Mark specially the words, I am the way.' In
   a twofold sense we take Christ as the way : according to his manhood
   and according to his Godhead. His manhood was the way of our own
   manhood. This we have to folloi'^ both the counsel of perfection as a
   whole and also in its parts. If but one of our members leaves the way
   of his example we are thereby deformed. St Paul declares we ought to
   live so that God may find in us the perfect reflection of all his
   divine works, i,e. we must copy the exemplar he has set before us. That
   is true spiritual life. But this is greatly hampered by numerous
   defects ; mainly numerous interior shortcomings due to the powers of
   our soul being disorderly. The joy of the soul should be so set upon
   its proper work that no created things can gladden her but only the
   fact that her consciousness is clear. As Christ said to his disciples,
   Rejoice not in anything except in this, that your names are written in
   the book of life.' And the fear of the soul should be so well
   controlled that she fears nothing under God either for person or
   possessions, nor aught that may be inflicted upon her whether by God or
   creature. And similarly with the

   other powers, desire and thought. The entire soul, in short, has to be
   gathered up into the impartible simplicity of her will and her will
   must fly at the highest good and fasten itself thereto. But St Paul
   says, He who is fastened to God becomes one spirit with him.'

   Behold how rich is the spirit grown thus one spirit with God ! No
   things can enrich it though it hold sway over them all. For things are
   necessaries whereas its riches consist in its dwelling in a nature
   superior to creaturely necessity. He who has nothing and needs nothing
   is richer than the man who possesses all things with necessity. St Paul
   says : Our sufliciency is in God alone whose able ministers we are.'

   Nor do the virtues enrich the spirit. Doctors declare that it is not,
   properly speaking, the virtues which enrich the spirit but the fruit of
   virtues. The soul has virtues of necessity. But virtues being a
   necessity, the spirit is of necessity not enriched by them. The utmost
   a spirit can attain to in this body is to dwell in a condition beyond
   the necessity of virtues ; where goodness as a whole comes natural to
   it so that not only is it possessed of virtues but virtue is part and
   parcel of it : it is virtuous not of necessity but of innate good
   nature. Arrived at this the soul has traversed and transcended all
   necessity for virtues : they are now intrinsic in her. Now she has
   reached the goal whither the virtues merely pointed her, to wit, the
   infusion of the Holy Ghost. This is the fruit of virtue ; this alone
   serves to enrich the spirit. Concerning this St Paul says : Put on the
   new man, Christ,' who was in this way our way.

   The other way is the way of his Godhead. ^

   -- ^What way has the Godhead and where can it go seeing it is in all
   places ; and wherewithal does it go seeing that it has no feet nor
   anything bodily ?

   -- The way of the Godhead is the unity wherein the three Persons run
   together into one essence. The going of the Persons consists in their
   mutual knowing and loving, each knowing and loving itself in the
   others. Thus do the Persons walk together in unity.

   The feet with which the Godhead enters the Persons and the Persons the
   essence are : the one foot of the Godhead is foresight of all things ;
   the other, pleasure in the things eternally foreseen, for God enjoys
   eternal wise the contingency of things. This refers to the eternal
   image. He enjoys only good in all things : image of all things which is
   very God.

   It may be questioned, What pleasure does God enjoy ?

   All things must needs please him for he who saw was God and what he saw
   was likewise God. In their eternal image which is God himself, God saw
   himself and saw things as a whole. God

   enjoyed himself, God being in himself the unique one. The soul sees her
   impartible idea in God^ which has never come out of him. This her
   multiform image does, and the consummation of her spirit lies in the
   reduction of its here created aught to the naught of its eternal
   prototype. God is the origin of the spirit and the spirit never rests
   till it returns into its origin, to its eternal proto- type.
   Essentially this prototype is God wherefore it aye eludes the spirit
   which is never able quite to apprehend it. Yet it divines how it has
   been in God eternalwise without itself ; and the supremcst bliss the
   spirit knows is to relapse into its origin, to its eternal image,
   wherein, as self, it is lost altogether. There the spirit loses its
   uses not its essence. The essence of the Godhead sucks the spirit out
   of itself into itself, making it as itself, so that there seems now but
   one essence. As though I were to take blood of a serpent -- which is
   very red -- and pour it into a trans- parent glass ; the glass would
   lose its seeming not its substance. So in this union the divine light
   illuminates and outshines the spirit which shines one light with it.
   The spirit loses its seeming not its substance for God has fetched the
   spirit out and united it with himself. Natheless the spirit in this
   union can never plumb the depths of Godhead. As St Paul discovered
   when, caught up to the third heaven, he saw things not permissible,
   nay, not possible to speak of, and cried out : O thou depth of the
   riches of wisdom and knowledge, how unsearchable are thy judgments and
   thy ways past finding out.' God's riches consist in having nothing and
   being nothing that can be clothed in words. His wisdom consists in the
   well-ordering of things. God's knowledge is his concqption of himself
   in his supernal light. Concerning which St Dionysius says, The light
   God dwells in is his own nature which is known to none besides
   himself.' This is the highway of the Godhead which no creature ever
   trod. Of it God spake by his prophet : As the heavens arc higher than
   the earth so arc my ways higher than thy ways.' -- St Augustine says.
   There is nothing more difficult and more exacting nor at the same time
   more useful and salutary to the soul than excursions in the science of
   the holy Trinity and unity.

   Mark well, therefore, the meaning of the Persons and the essence.

   -- ^What is a Person in the Trinity ?

   -- ^A Person is that which preserves its own rational individuality
   apart from any other distinct Person. One Person is not another. The
   work of the Persons consists in the genesis and output oi* things.
   Genesis belongs to the Father alone ; outputting of things to the
   Trinity jointly.

   -- ^What is the essence of the three Persons in the Trinity ?

   -- ^That which, impartible, contains all things impartibly while of
   itself as essence it neither generates nor produces things. That is
   done by the three Persons which activate the essence or it could do
   nothing. Nevertheless the Persons do not act as three ; they work as
   one God.

   -- What is the potentiality of the essence ?

   -- The potentiality of the essence lies in not being a rational Person
   : in persisting in its essential unity. Not that it differs from the
   Persons ; this same essence is the essential nature of the Persons and
   the being of all things. Existence of all existing things, life of all
   living things, the light of lights and nature of natures : all this it
   is in its impartibility. Not so with the Persons ; they are not the
   personality of things as essence is the essence of all things. The
   Father is not able to be anybody's person but his own. lie gat another
   Person out of his Person not out of his essence : with his nature in
   his nature. That the Father was able to produce a Son so rarely, so
   consummately his like, a God as perfect as himself, is due to his
   essential nature. When he begets the Son the Father gives him another
   Person than his own Person but not another nature nor another essence
   than his own. It follows that the essence is revealed in the procession
   of the Persons. The Persons are able to reveal the essence which cannot
   of itself reveal itself, seeing that of itself, as essence, it neither
   gets nor bears. This impotence of the essence is its chief potentiality
   ; nevertheless it is revealed to itself.

   The Persons know and comprehend the essence equally. The essence bears
   the same relation to all the Persons. Now i^ is a question among
   theologians whether or no the personality has basic knowledge and
   comprehension of the essence, seeing that the essence is comprehended
   only by the essence ?

   The Persons have basic knowledge and comprehension of the essence
   because this is the Persons' own essential nature ; more- over, the
   essence is not comprehended wholly save by the three Persons, whose
   nature it is. The Persons comprehend the essence wholly, they being God
   in Person by reason of their comprehension of his essence which is
   their own essential nature. And so far as the soul comprehends this
   essence she too is divine. Though what she comprehends of it is no
   bigger than a drop compared with all the boundless ocean. Still it is
   God whole. The surplus good which is ever baffling her apprehension,
   that is the shadowy abyss wherein, self-lost, she sinks eternally.

   It may be questioned. Why is there not one Person like one essence ? --
   I answer that, existing things exist not from themselves but in
   eternity are descended from an origin which is the origin

   of its own self and in time have been created out of nothing by the
   blessed Trinity. Their eternal origin is the Father and the universal
   image in him is the Son ; love to this same image is the Holy Ghost.
   Had not this archetype of all things been always in the Father, the
   Father could never have wrought anything at all. That is, in his
   modeless essence. There must be more than one Person, for it was in the
   eternal procession (that is, in the begetting of) the Son that things
   as a whole emanated from the Father and not from themselves. This
   eternal procession is the cause of things on their eternal side, but in
   time they were created from nothing and in this sense they are
   creatures. In the eternal procession wherein they flowed without
   themselves, they are God in God. For as St Dionysius says, the Prime
   Cause generates all things in the likeness of itself.

   Now mark the difference of this emanation in eternity and time. What is
   the (temporal) emanation ? It is the indulgence of his love of clear
   discrimination. So we come forth into time by constraint of his love.
   The eternal procession is the revelation of himself to himself. The
   knower being that which is known. This is the eternal flow no drop of
   which did ever fall into any created intelligence ; it is the Son from
   the Father. In the temporal emanation things flowed forth finite. In
   the eternal emanation they remain infinite. The flow goes flowing on in
   itself. As St Dionysius hath it, God is a fountain flowing into
   itself.'

   The Father is the origin of his Son, in his eternal child-bearing ;
   Father and Son originate their Spirit, in the eternal out-pouring.
   Butj^omeone may question, how about the Father-nature ? Is it the cause
   (of the essence or is the essence cause) of the Paternity ?

   What follows needs clear thinking. Essence as essence neither gives nor
   takes. Now were the essence origin of the Father then the essence,
   being parent, would not be essence, it would be Person. But it is not ;
   for essence in its unity is not Person. Again, were paternity the
   origin of essence the cause of this would be the paternal Person. But
   this is not so either. The Father in Person is a cause but not of
   essence ; for paternity and essence have the same characteristic. That
   is why, in his paternity, he is the omnipotent cause. The essence
   cannot be apart from Person nor can Person be apart from nature, as ye
   can see. For nothing that exists can be without its nature, since it
   cannot take leave of itself ; it must be what it is. Now the Father is
   a Person and he cannot be a Person without a nature nor can his nature
   be without a Person. Given his nature, there must be someone whose
   nature it is. Note then that the essence can in nowise

   exist without distinction and hypostasis. Person and hypostasis can in
   nowise be without their nature, to wit, their essence.

   Thus it is demonstrated that neither is the essence cause of paternity
   nor paternity cause of the essence, for neither can be without the
   other. The Son cannot be without the Father nor the Father without the
   Son nor the twain without the Holy Ghost albeit they have three
   properties to distinguish them apart. Not so with paternity and
   essence. Neither of these can be without the other. For albeit essence
   is not Person nor Person essence yet paternity and essence have the
   same nature so that neither can be said to be the origin of the other ;
   for it is with one and the same nature that the Father originates his
   Son and these twain originate their Spirit which is of one nature with
   them both.

   All hail to the exalted spirit that is received into this full, this
   naked knowledge which is unknown to those that are not naked of
   themselves. For the soul to be naked she must turn away from all the
   images and forms spread out before her and stop at none of them. For
   the divine nature is no form nor semblance that she can understand.
   Being turned away from these towards what transcends them -- divorced,
   that is, from images and forms -- ^the soul receives the likeness of
   the formless nature of God whose real form has never been revealed to
   any creature. This is the secret door into the divine nature, which the
   soul has in the image. For when the soul has naught to stay her, she is
   ready to pass into the image of God whereto none can attain be he not
   stripped of spiritual matter. Alas, how they obstruct this secret
   passage, those who so lightly stop in temporal things ! Wherein also
   acknowledge my wretchedness. In this sense St Dionysius exhorted his
   disciples, saying, An thou wouldst know the hidden mystery of God,
   transcend whatever hinders thy pure perception,' When with her pure
   intellect now illumined with divine light, the naked soul sees God,
   then she knows herself. And when she sees how apt she is to him, how
   she is his and how they arc both one, then, the burden of the body
   permitting, she remains thus always. This lofty intuition the soul has
   of the hidden mystery of God is that of which Job tells : In the horror
   of a vision by night he cometh and whispereth in the ears of men.' What
   does he mean by the horror ? Solicitude for this perception we arc
   speaking of. The nocturnal vision is the revelation of the hidden
   truth. And the whispering is the flowing union wherein kriower and
   known are one.

   pray you for God's sake, for it was forbidden to me to do so. If any

   COMMENTARY ON THE GOSPEL OF ST .JOHN

   The profound Gospel of St John begins : in principio erat verhum^ that
   is to say :

   In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word
   was God.' He who would grasp the interpretation of these abstruse
   writings of St John, which with God's help I shall unfold, let him turn
   his mind from created things and from his own understanding, that being
   illumined by God's spirit he may apprehend the meaning I shall give to
   these dark sayings.

   To start with, I premise from his words, in the beginning,' a beginning
   without beginning. In God's name I proceed. In the beginning was the
   Word : in the source of the effulgent formal light of rational creature
   and in the origin of its radiance the Word subsisted as the perfect
   Word, perfect in its wordless potentiality, and this wordless word was
   with God. This gives me a hint of some distinction, the word being with
   God. Now bring your best intelligence to bear on this. When the bound
   word of the Persons' unity remained unuttered by the omnipotent
   intellect, then the Word, suspended in its divine origin tran- scended
   all words and names. When it was with God in the providential light
   dawning devoid of the created universe, then God was manifest to the
   world. Wherefore I, Meistcr Eekhart, do affirm : as soon as God was he
   created the world, the world being with God distinct in name. Whereas
   God in his motionless power was free from God and every name, God was
   the unspoken word in the bottomless abyss of his divine nature wherein
   the Word as such did never throughly understand itself. A thing that
   understands itself waxes and wanes in the act of understand- ing, but
   this word does not wax or wane, it is unchanging in itself, so it has
   never understood itself in itself albeit it is the intellect of the
   Father. It was in the beginning of the new procession of the Son that
   that the Son proceeded forth into the time of natural images united
   with the word ever-abiding in the paternal source. This same Word
   wrought its entire work of nature after the fashion of a person,
   humanly, and the bound Word itself energises in the Father in his
   characteristic nature, this same word being eternally immanent by
   nature. And. such

   TRACTATES 897

   being the nature of the Word it is therefore permissible to say, In the
   beginning was the Word.*

   I will now give the psychic interpretation, which whosoever cannot
   understand let him go to the truth for enlightenment.

   In the beginning of the divine nature the soul is seeking herself above
   the points of time. Cast into the abysmal naught of the divine nature,
   her receptivity all gone, her portion in her felicity is the perfect
   naught that distinguishes her from creatures generally. As our Lord
   says, Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.' But were it
   that the soul could know God with his own peculiar nature she would be
   loving something above God. Accord- ingly I say, that this word
   subsisting in the essential activity of the divine nature is the soul
   wholly deprived of receptivity, for with this she would be loving
   herself and all she is with a personal nature. So she may properly
   aflirm herself to be the work of God in the beginning where, albeit she
   is formless, she is expressing form. But the form she gets from God is
   gotten by the sealing in the soul of God's own nature. In the beginning
   of her nothing- ness was the word and the word was with God as Son and
   the Word was God.

   He goes on to say, The same was in the beginning with God.* Mark, I
   have jxist said, In the beginning was the Word.' Now 1 say, and the
   Word was in the beginning with God.' From these cryptic statements it
   appears that the Word was with God in the beginning. Now 1 suggest an
   obvious rational meaning. The word was in the beginning with God.' 1
   say, in the principle of paternity this same principle is to the Father
   the source of his entire Godhead, personal and essential, of Son and
   Spirit. ^

   St John says, The word was in the beginning with God.' Since there is
   in the Father an outpouring of his causeless divinity into the Word of
   his Son, this must occur in the paternal mind when, looking upon
   himself in the light of his abiding intellect, he perceives himself in
   the answering reflection in his divine essence ; or, in other words,
   the conception of the Word is God. Moreover by this reflection of his
   divine nature the intellect of the Father fashions or utters itself in
   imitation of his nature. So the Word is Son and it is in the divine
   substance, to wit, in the intellectual reflection of the Father, that
   occurs this birth of the Word proceeding, thus it is one in essence and
   distinct in Person. Hence we may say : The same was in the beginning
   with God ' ; and because introspection and reflection of the divine
   nature are involved in its continuous thinking of itself, therefore
   this birth is eternal. For if once this reflection were to stop, if
   mental holiday, inertia, should once supervene, there would remain one
   God without distinction of Persons. Thus the Word of the

   Father subsists eternally in its parental origin. Thereby it is ever
   being conceived and being born and born. The same was in the
   father-principle with God as distinct Person. This may well stand in
   lieu of my forhier explanations of the passage, In the beginning was
   the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. The same was
   in the beginning with God.' This is now fully explained.

   Next come the words, All things were made by him and without him was
   not anything made.' Examine this carefully. Granting that all things
   were made by him and that without him nothing was made, then supposing
   someone asks me, Can God do anything without me seeing, that all things
   were made by him and without him was not anything made ? ' I answer.
   No. God made all things with me standing in the groundless ground of
   God ; God made all things through me while I stood in him idle. While
   the Father was performing the act peculiar to his nature I was standing
   right in the gate through which all things return perfectly free to
   their supreme felicity. As our Lord said,

   Father, to know thee one true God and only Son, that is eternal life.'
   If life eternal be aught beside the rational soul I have no knowledge
   of it.

   To return. Since I was lying dormant in the personal nature of the
   Father when he created creatures as a whole in his own nature, it
   follows that I was working with him ; I was the work of God wherein he
   wrought all things as giver, I being then conscious in my Personal
   nature of co-operating with the divine nature in this divine process.
   All the while I was working with him I was resting in God's nature
   exactly as I was in God before I was created. God made the universe and
   I with him, standing as I did all undefined albeit substantial in the
   Father.

   Observe further, All things were made by him.' If everything was made
   by him and without him nothing was made, then I affirm there is a power
   in the soul centred in the perennial now in the paternal heart and in
   the nature of God ; nor does it differ from the essential nature of God
   save in being the ereated image of God, as one saint observes : What
   the soul cannot conceive by nature can never be hers by grace.' Like
   corn-seed dropped into the ground and lost to view, even so the seed or
   spark in the soul is shed from the essential nature of the Father, and
   is shining back into the incomprehensible essence, into that wherein
   the soul conceives superintelligibly, beatifically. There, in beatific
   mode, bereft of life and power, she returns to the uncreated good
   where, robbed of every faculty, she is the image in the Trinity, as our
   Lord said, Father, make them one with us.' And when my soul, doffing
   her beatific habit, is buried in the paternal

   field, in the living vine, as the gospel says : when in this sense I
   lose myself and come into my own as the rightful Son, then I with God
   do make all things and the Word is in the beginning with God.

   Take the next words, and without him was not anything made.' I offer
   this interpretation of them. In all rational creatures I find the quest
   of God. They forge ahead according to the time and will bestowed upon
   it. But without him nothing is accomplished, in those creatures namely
   who, even as the brutes, stop at their outward powers ; their mental
   works are worthless, lacking as they do the divine light and spiritual
   freedom which gives them permanence. Christ says, What my heavenly
   Father planted not shall be plucked up, yea by the very roots.* That is
   all I want to say about this passage.

   Take the next, What was made, in him was the life.' To see what this
   means, turn yc blessed and commune with the under- standing of your
   uncreated intellect. What was made, in him was the life.' In this
   eternal procession, wherein all things pro- ceeded forth without
   themselves, they were now ; but in time they were created from nothing
   and their life is in him. Thereof they are the creatures, the effect of
   that cause, the patent of his power resplendent in luminous detail.
   Thus we came forth into time ; but the revelation of himself to himself
   is in his eternal procession where the knower is the same as what is
   known, to wit, the eternal emanation which is the Son from the Father,
   in whom all things flow forth. Thus what was made was the life in him.

   Look you. All rational creatures proceeded from God alike, wherefore I
   say : all things participate in every intelleetual mode. I hold that in
   her abstract understanding every rational soul knows the uncreated
   image which is her life. Now if my life and the life of all creatures
   is in God, I ask then. Can God know himself in me without my soul ? I
   answer, No. Man knows heat apart from the fire and light apart from the
   sun but God cannot know himself without the soul. And why ? Because the
   soul is the out-flowing stream of the eternal deity and she is sealed
   in the image of the blessed Trinity. By this she knows she is God's
   creation. Therein I know the love of the divine fire whereby rational
   creatures are illumined. I say ; as the Father made me naked and free
   that I might stay and make my home in the groundless ground of the
   innermost heart of the Godhead, even so my soul must be utterly
   despoiled if I am to be beatified with God. As St Paul observes, He who
   is joined to God is one spirit with him.' The Father cannot know
   himself without me, seeing that I stand in the ground of his eternal
   deity wherein his whole incomprehensible work is wrought with me and
   what is compre-

   hended that I am. By which I mean the light of the divine Sun, the
   universal life-giver, therefore I see that God cannot know himself
   without me. The life was the light of men,' St John says.

   Now realize the marvellous significance of this. What I say is : the
   life which is the light of men is man himself understanding
   (conceiving) himself in the wonder of the primordial power of the
   Father, in the leaping forth of his mysterious naught, in the blinding
   light of his indwelling Word brought forth in eternal creation, albeit
   the uncreated nature of the nameless essence. It is his nature and his
   wont, with perfectly receptive understand- ing, to take the
   incomprehensible essence for his own nature whereby the wonders of the
   negating naught are revealed to him, the night of the mind becoming
   bright like noon in the light of his pure primitive perfection and his
   distinct ineffable perfections shine out as clear as day. As David
   says, The truth shall not be hidden from thee and thy night shall be as
   light as day.' And as his light is so is his enlightenment for in the
   naked essence man knows himself even as he is known. Which knowing, our
   Lord said, I am the door of my sheep-fold.' In these words he invites
   us to enter by the door of his emanation and return into the source
   whence we came forth, for this gives promise in us of something more
   than is afforded by the soul's beatitude.

   Haply thou wilt say, Good Brother, if the life is become the light of
   men enabling them to know themselves as they are known, is it then
   possible for me to know myself the very Son of God ? ' I answer and
   say, that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is so £d:tached to the
   Father's nature that never for an instant docs he quit the paternal
   mode of deity. He wrought his whole work in that nature and into that
   nature which gives being to all things and he did so freely, in
   absolute idleness, for no reason at all. Here, bound to human nature, I
   have to work above nature freely, in absolute idleness or motionless
   quiet, so as not to be hindered by myself and by my personal nature and
   by things which are conditioned by time and temporalities ; for to know
   all things in the cause of their existence I must soar beyond all
   lights, temporal and eternal, and plunge into the causeless essence
   which gives mind and being to my soul. Drowned in this being, aware of
   self and things merely as being, my soul has lost her name and there
   remains no nature but that which, in the Father, is eternally in
   travail with the Son and as such I am a new man born in his nature and
   doing all I do supernaturally in the divine nature. As our Lord said,
   When I am lifted up I will draw all things after me.' So I being lifted
   up with all my powers into the uncreated good do be with Christ one
   body and with God one

   spirit and do draw all things to me in one pure, perfect nature. As the
   gospel says, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.' Knowing
   myself none other than the Son of God, in that same sonship I am cast
   into my middle power and that in the perennial now, thus the eternal
   Word is born in me unceasingly, as our Lord says, Father, glorify thy
   Son.* In this interpretation lies the explanation of the words, How
   hardly does the rich man enter the kingdom of heaven.' Christ says in
   effect that the life is none other than the naked spark alight within
   the soul, which in the groundless Godhead knows itself none but God ;
   to wit, the light which in rational creatures is splendid with the
   truth. I might give another meaning but I fear ye could not follow it.

   To continue : The light shineth in the darkness and the dark- ness
   comprehendeth it not.' I make no comment here save to lament to the
   eternal truth what numbers fail to realize the high perfection, the
   deep happiness, glowing unseen within the soul. Christ says, Blessed be
   the eyes which see the things ye see.' He did not mean our bodily eyes,
   he meant those eyes, twin powers of the soul, set in her mind. As the
   gospel says, There was a man sent from God whose name was John.'
   Verily, be they male or female, these souls are John, for John denotes
   the grace of God. What is grace ? There is a power in the soul which is
   idle and does no work ; this is none other than the image of God, not
   that grace is itself this image, it is its form which reforms and
   transfigures the soul ; and in this re-formation wherein she has no
   form, in this transformation in which she has all forms, the omniform
   form, there is this quiet the soul has, she being self-contained
   because the truth is in her : not as hers nor as a quality. As Christ
   said, He that enjoyeth me liveth eternally.' Such an one is sent from
   God but is not God-forsaken. Christ says, He that sent me sendeth me
   not alone, he sendeth also every one that doeth the will of my Father.'

   There are four signs to tell a man that he is sent from God. First,
   that in time he is superior to time and temporalities. Secondly, being
   therein he is detached from creatures. The third is, that he is idle or
   quiet-minded. The fourth is, that he is not changeable by nature.
   Christ said, 1 am that I am.' Possessing these a man may take it that
   he is sent from God and his name is John for he is the grace of God
   itself. Hence Paul's words, God is my soul's new form wherein she is
   formless.'

   Pass on to the next. He came to bear witness to the light that all
   might believe in him.' Examine this carefully. The words are open to a
   purely figurative interpretation. Just as he (John) bore witness to the
   light of the divine unity concealed in Christ

   26

   in order that all might believe in him, so forerunning intuition tells
   the soul of insight into the innermost recesses of the mind where
   shines the spark which knows itself none other than the uncreated good
   of the ineffable Deity. Then the soul with all her powers acknowledges
   and affirms the Son eternally in the Father and eternally born of the
   Father who is without beginning. As Christ said, Whoso heareth my Word
   and keepeth it liveth forever.'

   Now take this in another sense. I will put a question and answer it
   myself : What reference has this to the true light ? Look you. There is
   a power in the soul called mind, God sent it with the soul, it is her
   storehouse of incorporeal forms and intel- lectual notions. This
   soul-capacity the Father fashions in his outflowing divinity whereby
   all the words of his divine essence flow into the word in our mind in
   distinction of Person just as memory pours out treasure of images into
   the powers of the soul. When the soul sees in this power the form of a
   rational creature, an angel's or her own form, the idea of the Father
   is clearly impressed in the soul angelically. But on penetrating
   deeper, into the very centre of the soul, intellect finds God there in
   this power face to face, and in this capacity, if she recollect herself
   to con- template the vision of God in her, there wakes another power of
   the soul called understanding and the eternal Word is born, conceived
   by the soul while subsisting eternal in the Father,

   . these two powers forming one amicable disposition which gives ;
   direction to the intellect and is its will towards its source. When th?
   spirit is flowing from the Father and the Son into this power and into
   all the powers she has, the soul, oriented to God, grows cognisant of
   his image as her eternal prototype in God and she ; perceives too how
   the holy Trinity is sealed in her. Thus the energies of the soul all
   bear witness to the light of the blessed Trinity that gives light to
   all mankind and they acknowledge and affirm and believe in the Son born
   in this man without ceasing. As the gospel says, He was not the light
   but bare witness to the light.'

   Mark what follows. That was the true light, which lighteth every man
   that cometh into the world.' Throw wide now the ears of understanding
   to catch the arcane meaning of the boundary between created and
   uncreated light which is plainly indicated in St John's words, That was
   the true light.' Taking the name John to mean the light of grace, as
   said above, then I propose to show what may be rightly termed * the
   true light that lighteth every man,' which we receive direct.

   I distinguish five lights. The first is devilish light, the second
   natural light, the third is angelic light, the fourth is spiritu^

   light, the fifth is divine light. Mark carefully how these five lights
   differ.

   The first or devilish light leads all astray from the truth. This can
   be seen in cases where the outward man is not entirely in sympathy with
   the inward man. Supposing then .that the in- ward man is sunk into his
   inner mind, where the eternal Word is born in the perennial now, the
   sudden shock of seeing the out- ward man pictured in the uncertain,
   fluctuating light of time, will distort the light of his understanding
   and stop the eternal birth from taking place. This shows it to be
   devilish light and it behoves you therefore to turn away from it to the
   peace and quiet of your higher mind. By this means Mary in her
   virginity, being enlightened by the Holy Ghost, contrived to shun ideas
   of temporal things and thus, transcending time, to harmonise her inner
   and her outer man into one settled calm, quite free from images, and
   this shows you the difference between this devilish light and the
   divine light.

   The second light is natural light. The line of demarcation between
   natural light and the divine light comes where soul sees spirit direct
   in very truth. Thinking in natural light, in random images, human
   nature is changing, waxing and waning, sensible of weal and woe, as
   Christ shows by his death and passion. But when human nature is face to
   face with her proper self she is reflected into the divine nature. I
   ask then, does the soul in this natural light remain changeless in time
   ? I say, no. That is a supertemporal state of union with the divine
   light and by the grace of God. Being drawn or caught up into the
   suavity of the indwelling spirit of God, the soul loves universal human
   nature as her own nature, as God has been loving it eternally, where
   this nature is set over time in the light of glory. Apart from this
   light, this man has the natural light of indwelling grace and at the
   point where he expresses the idea everything in this light of nature
   must needs fade away out of time, as I have said. Even so Mary was
   changeless by nature inasmuch as she was free from sinful accidents in
   the idea of her created nature wherein she knew and loved all mankind.
   Here ye have the difference between the light of nature in time and
   light of that nature beyond time in eternal glory. To me it proves that
   all creatures are one man, loving God by nature.

   The third light is angelic light. Now you must know that every
   individual angel is always open to any ideas that he may choose, one
   more than another according to the idiosyncrasy of his angelic nature.
   Their stability is not impaired thereby provided they know and will and
   love in idleness. This uncreated understanding Lucifer had, and if
   Lucifer in his creaturehood had seen into the

   light of nature, if his creature nature had veered round in his angelic
   nature to his formless divine nature, he would never have fallen from
   the truth. As Isaiah observes, The angelic light in man is the means.'
   In the divine light the soul is not subject to ideas nor can any shape
   appear to her now that she knows, with knowledge that transcends the
   soul's, of the inearnation of the Word. Even so Mary, aloof in absolute
   purity of mind and body, knew creatures as a whole in super-angelic
   light and her mind conceiving no form save the unformed form of God,
   she knew herself to be the ornament of God not fashioned in the form of
   any creature. Wherefore she cried, My spirit hath rejoiced in God my
   saviour.'

   The fourth light is spiritual light, which is moreover the medium of
   the light of grace in the mind. In this light of the spirit ye know how
   to order things in your mind with a view to the con- templation and
   enjoyment of the groundless essence in your soul. Absorbed therein ye
   are aware that the divine deep transcends the highest height of
   creatures. Why, I ask, was Peter oblivious of himself upon the mountain
   when Christ was transfigured before his three disciples ? I answer,
   that the spiritual light of his mind was eclipsed by interior vision of
   the divine light : he forgot his own form on perceiving himself in this
   glory as the reflection ever streaming back to its paternal source. By
   formlessly appre- hending in itself the bound Word whereto Christ knew
   himself united, he was taking the Christ-image for his own image. How-
   beit he was not ravished into the divine light of the perfect intellect
   but he was caught up into the spiritual light of its reflection
   shinifig back into its actual self. Beyond this spiritual light Mary
   was ravished when at the annunciation she conceived the Word in the
   word begotten according to the love of men.

   The fifth light is divine light. Therein stood Mary always, bearing her
   gracious child. But Christ was born of her bodily. This birth
   transcends all sense and reason and whoso is rapt away into this
   unveiled light perceives himself none other than that essence wherein
   God has his being, his very Godhead. An we would bear with Mary this
   eternal Word we must be caught up past the four lights into this fifth
   where we are ever giving birth to God in spirit as Mary bare him in the
   flesh.

   To continue. He was in the world and the world knew him not,' vide what
   was said above anent the difference between created and uncreated
   light. I say, this means in the world of his pro- vidential knowledge.
   What time the world was in the Father as uncreated essence, his light,
   his flowing intellect to wit, was shining on this world-stuff wherein
   the world subsisted in the Father in uncreated formless simplicity. But
   in its first eruption

   TRACTATES 405

   the world leaps forth manifold albeit this multiplicity is one
   essentially. In this eruption this world was self-luminous light.

   Mark a second interpretation of the words, He was in the world and the
   world was made by him.* By this world I under- stand none other than
   the divine man. See how this divine light may be called the world. I
   say, man has within his soul the power of being all creatures, stones,
   trees and all the rest of them, and that in this same potentiality his
   mind has gotten the universal prototype of creatures discriminately. So
   within the ambit of her five senses the soUl compares with rational and
   irrational creatures. In this sense the soul has gotten both the form
   and matter, the rational and irrational natures of creature generally.
   In this sense all things were made in man. And by the same token,
   before God made everything as such, hell, purgatory, everything, was
   God : this man is the world this light was in, this is the world that
   was made by him. John says, All things were made by him and without him
   was not anything made.' From which I can only gather that multitudinous
   man too is the world, to wit the world of darkness which comprehended
   not the light referred to in Christ's words, I am the light of the
   world and whoso walkcth in me walketh not in darkness.' Here our Lord
   is inviting rational men to follow his example.

   He goes on to say, He came into his own and his own received him not.'
   This refers to Christ and I apply it to the individual soul as well. He
   is come into his own and his own have neither known him nor accepted
   him. I say : whatever is found in Christ's nature is found in the
   highest power of the soul, therefore God is man's own, but his own is
   not received by him. I refer to the intellectual five senses. Clearly
   we have a parable of this in the woman at the well to whom Christ said,
   Show me thy husband.' The woman answered, I have no husband.' Christ
   said, Thou sayest truly : thou hast had five husbands and him whom thou
   now hast is not really thy husband.' I take it that her interests had
   lain in her five senses. Christ's words, him whom thou now hast is not
   really thy husband,' I interpret to mean that she was neglecting the
   intellect she had so it was no true man to her. When God comes sensibly
   to the soul, which is his own, he is received by what is not his own,
   to wit the outward senses and inward faculties of the soul. When God is
   conceived by the soul insensibly then we can say, our abode is in
   heaven.' This passage is clear in the light of the foregoing.

   I Brother John, propound two questions. They concern the statement, But
   as many as received him, to them gave he power to become God's sons,
   even to them that believe in his name.' r ask in the first place, does
   the power to become God's sons lie

   with us or with God ? In the second I ask, what name do we believe in ?
   My answers are briefly as follows.

   To start with it must be borne in mind that God is without will,
   without love, without justice, without mercy, nay without divinity or
   anything we can ascribe to him or predicate of him or attribute to him
   (for any good attributed to God or predicated of him simply reduces God
   to naught), so it is with the soul that lies the power, the ability to
   make this her own will ; in her real will she is incapable of stooping
   to anything opposed to the nature of that will, and at the point where
   God and spirit vanish, in that same point I am the Son of God, begotten
   of God eternally according to Christ's words, I am the only-begotten
   Son of God,' for I am free from self in all crcaturehood. Where 1 am
   God is and where God is I am and our joint love is God and he who
   dwells in this love dwells in God and God in him. Then mine is the
   highest angel God has in heaven, as much as he is God's, by whose power
   and by whose might we make ourselves God's sons, for he em- powers us
   with himself, penetrating the will of the soul even as Father and Son
   permeate their common Spirit. That is the answer to the first question
   to the best of my knowledge at present.

   Now to answer the second question : What divine name do we believe in ?
   That is written in the gospel in Christ's words, Father, this is
   eternity or eternal life, to believe in thee the true God, i.e, truly
   as God.' Truth is God, and love, as truly as God is God. If God is free
   from names then, I durst not think I have the name of Henry nor of
   Conrad nor of Ulric for by adding any- thing to God I block him with an
   idol ; but he who believes in the name of God rejoices in the universal
   name, to wit the divine name which we believe in. In this unfathomable
   light of faith, faith makes us of multitudinous knowledge ignorant, of
   multi- tudinous will without volition, in multitudinous form unshapen.
   And so with the prophet, I say, ye are Gods.' Believing in the name of
   God we are God's sons. If anyone is able to give a better answer to
   these two questions I would fain hear it.

   (He goes on to say, Which were born not of blood nor of the will of the
   flesh nor of the will of man ') for flesh and blood and human will
   unconquered cannot possess the kingdom of heaven till they are born
   again in God. This is quite clear, the meaning is patent to all. But I
   desire to speak briefly on the subject of manhood,

   I say : the highest power of the soul is the man, her will namely,
   which always stands bare and uncovered. The second power is intellect,
   the woman, who is always veiled, and the lower is raised up to the
   higher. Now when the power we call the man, i,e. the will, is joined to
   the power we called the woman, the intellect,

   TRACTATES 407

   that IS t6 say, then the woman brings forth fruit in the perennial now.
   When the male is parted from the female power man's will is wavering in
   false light. The apostle truly says, the Word was made flesh.' The
   manhood of Christ as seeing in[to God] has a reflection in the Father's
   personal nature. In the groundless substance of the Godhead human
   nature stands perfectly steady, gazing down in the transcendent light
   for love of creatures. Thus divine and human nature are atoned in human
   nature. And by the same token, even if Adam had not fallen yet would
   Christ have been made man by reason of the love proceeding which is
   ever being born in eternity in the divine nature and was bound to
   become man in Christ owing to the idiosyncrasy of that nature which
   flowed for aye out of the groundless ground of God. The smallest spark
   falling from out the least and lowest of the angels would illuminate
   and outshine this world and it would dim the brightest lights of human
   and angelic nature did it shine next to God. So Christ restores human
   nature not angelic nature. As his divinity lay hid in his humanity when
   the Word was made flesh ' in him, so let us hide our human nature in
   his divine nature in that same Word which was incarnate. By living the
   Christ life more than my own life I am Christ rather than myself and my
   proper name is Christ rather than James or John, and so this befall
   beyond time I am changed into God.

   Now listen to another meaning, the incarnation of the Word in the
   sacrament. Just as he made his body in the sacrament by word and
   knowledge and took and gave it to his disciples idly, without motion or
   passion, that is to say, nor was this sacrament consummated by
   knowledge alone but by words as well, even so I observe that in the
   highest power of the soul, corresponding to the Father-nature,
   intellect begat itself in the image of Divinity to smite into this Word
   as perfect will and in the groundless love of this same will the Holy
   Ghost was gotten in the Word with this same intellect. And still this
   birth is ever going on in the sacrament to those who arc Christ
   properly so called : these people are true priests and in the truth,
   for their going is above the angels and they are not to be touched by
   temporal things. As Christ said to Mary Magdalene, Touch me not for I
   am risen,* so verily these souls are risen with Christ. God gives
   himself freely, idly, as he gave himself to his disciples in token of
   the love which works the same in us, and those who take this sacrament
   as freely and resignedly and unselfhindered, do receive it as really as
   the giver gives it and he who takes it otherwise does not wholly and
   solely resign him to the truth. When in the sacrament I receive God
   from God thus supersacramentally, I am actually changed into the same
   that I receive, thus the Word is made

   flesh and dwells among us mystically and wherever this is realized
   there is the proof of the divine spark, moreover I ma]k^ bold to say,
   were anyone prepared for outward food as for the sacrament he would
   receive God as much as in the sacrament ; which is to many people a
   hard saying albeit quite consistent with the truth, for the gift
   prepares for its own reception and I should be the thing prepared for
   that which has prepared me. St John says, We have his glory, the glory
   of the only-begotten of the Father full of grace and truth.' From which
   I gather that anyone who knows the joys of the divine life is shining
   within and without like the only Son of God, as St Paul says, I live
   not but Christ liveth in me in his love.'

   Consider what is meant by sons of God and children of God. To be God's
   children in the sense that he created us is not enough. For instance.
   If I paint my likeness on the wall, he who sees the likeness is not
   seeing me ; but anyone who sees me sees my like- ness and not my
   likeness merely but my child. If I really knew my soul, anyone who saw
   my conception of it would say it was my son for I share therewith my
   energy and nature, and as here so is it in the Godhead. The Father
   understands himself perfectly clearly so there appears to him his
   image, that is to say, his Sou, The Father is light, the Son is light
   and image and the Holy Ghost also is light and image and inasmuch as
   the Father imagines (or conceives) his Son he is called Son and
   inasmuch as he endows him with his nature he is called his child.
   Likewise that man is the image of God who, being detached from things,
   is living as spirit in the spirit of God and such have glory and honour
   as the only Son of God full of grace and truth of the reflection of
   God, and really containing and possessing God in them ; thus the
   kingdom of God is within us.

   Here endeth the Commentary on this Gospel.

   XIX 1

   THE BEATIFIC VISION

   King David said : Lord in thy light shall we see light.' Doctors debate
   as to the medium in which we shall see God. The common doctrine is that
   it will be in the light of glory. But this solution appears to me to be
   unsound and untenable. From time to time I have explained that man has
   within him a light called the active intellect : this is the light in
   which man will see God in bliss, so they seek to prove. Now man
   according to his creaturely nature is in great imperfection and is
   unable by nature ' See Preger, Oeachichte der deutachen Myatiker^ vol.
   i, p. 484.

   to discern God otherwise than as creatures do, by images and forms, as
   I have elsewhere demonstrated. The soul is unable of herself and by her
   own innate power to transcend this state ; that must happen in some
   supernatural power such as the light of grace. Mark this solution which
   I will now proceed to discuss.

   St Paul says : ^ By God's grace 1 am that I am.' He does not say that
   he is of grace.' There is a difference between being by grace and being
   grace itself. Doctors declare that form gives being to matter. Now
   there are various definitions of grace current among them. But I say
   grace is nothing else than the flowing light proceeding direct from
   God's nature into the soul : a supernatural form of the soul which
   gives her a supernatural nature. This is what I had in mind when I
   stated that the soul was unable of herself to transcend her own natural
   activity ; this she can do in the powder of grace which endows her with
   a super- natural nature.

   Observe, grace effects nothing by itself. Moreover it exalts the soul
   above activity, (irace is bestowed in the essence of the soul and is
   received into her powers ; for if the soul is to effect anything in
   this matter, she must needs have grace by virtue of which to transcend
   her own activities such as knowing and loving. Whilst the soul is in
   process of taking this transcendental flight out of herself into the
   nothingness of herself and her own activity, she is by grace ' ; she is
   grace wdien she has accomplished this transcendental passage and has
   overcome herself and now stands in her pure virginity alone, conscious
   of nothing but of behaving after the manner of God. As God lives, while
   the soul is still capable of knowing and acting after the manner of her
   creaturc- liness and as a child of nature, she has not become grace
   itself though she may well be by grace. For to be grace itself the soul
   must be as destitute of activity, inw^ard and outward, as grace is,
   which knows no activity. St John says : To us is given grace for
   grace,' for to become grace by grace is the work of grace. The supreme
   function of grace is to reduce the soul to what it is itself. Grace
   robs the soul of her own activity ; grace robs the soul of her own
   nature. In this supernatural flight the soul transcends her natural
   light which is a creature and comes into immediate touch with God.

   Now I w^ould have you understand me. I am going to give an explanation
   I have never given before. The worthy Dionysius says : When God exists
   not for the spirit there exists not for it either the eternal image,
   its eternal origin.' I have said before and say again that God has
   wrought one act eternally in which act he made the soul in his own
   [likeness], and out of which act and by means of which act the soul
   issued forth into her created

   existence, becoming unlike God and estranged from h?l^own proto- type,
   and in her creation she made God, who was not before the soul was made.
   At various times I have declared : I am the cause that God is God. God
   is gotten of the soul, his Godhead of him- self; before creatures were,
   God was not God albeit he was Godhead which he gets not from the soul.
   Now when God finds a naughted soul whose self and whose activity have
   been brought to naught by means of grace, God works his eternal work in
   her above grace, raising her out of her created nature. Here God
   naughts himself in the soul and then neither God nor soul is left. Be
   sure that this is God indeed. When the soul is capable of conceiving
   God's work she is in the state of no longer having any God at all ; the
   soul is then the eternal image as which God has always seen her, his
   eternal Word. When, therefore, St Dionysius says that God no longer
   exists for the spirit, he means what I have just explained.

   Now it may be asked whether the soul as here seen in the guise of the
   eternal image is the light meant by David wherein we shall see eternal
   light ?

   We answer, no. Not in this light will the soul sec the eternal light
   that shall beatify her ; for, says the worthy Dionysius, neither will
   the eternal image exist for the spirit.' What' he means is that, when
   the spirit has accomplished its transcendental flight, its creaturely
   nature is brought to naught, whereby it loses God as I have already
   explained, and then the soul, in the eternal image, breaks through the
   eternal image into the essential image of the Father. Thus saith the
   Scriptures : Everything flows back in the soul into the Father who is
   the beginning of the eternal Word and of all creatures.'

   It may be questioned whether this is the light, the Father namely, in
   which the spirit sees the eternal light ?

   I answer, no. Now mark my words. God works and has created all things ;
   the Godhead docs not work, it knows nothing of creation. In my eternal
   prototype the soul is God for there God works and my soul has equality
   with the Father, for my eternal prototype, which is the Son in the
   Godhead, is in all respects equal with the Father. One scripture says :
   Naught is equal with God ; to be equal with God, then, the soul must be
   naught.' That interpretation is just. We would say, however : where
   there is equality there is no unity for equal is a privation of unity ;
   and where there is unity there is no equality for equality resides in
   multiplicity and separation. Where there is equality there cannot be
   unity.. ^ 1 am not equal to myself. I am the same as myself. Hence the
   Son in the Godhead, inasmuch as he is Son, is equal with the Father but
   he is not one with the Father. There

   TRACTATES 411

   is no equality where Father and Son are one ; that is, in the unity of
   the divine essence. In this unity the Father knows no Son nor does the
   Son know any Father, for there there is neither Father nor Son nor Holy
   Ghost. When the soul enters into the Son, her eternal prototype wherein
   she is equal with the Father, then, breaking through her eternal
   prototype, she, with the Son, tran- scends equality and possesses unity
   with the three Persons in the unity of the essence. David says : Lord
   in thy light shall we see light,' that is : in the light of the
   impartible divine essence shall we sec the divine essence and the whole
   ])crfection of the divine essence as revealed in the variety of the
   Persons and the unity of their nature. St Paul says : We shall be
   changed from one brightness into the other and shall become like unto
   him,' meaning : we shall be changed from created light into the un-
   created splendour of the divine nature and shall become like it ; that
   is, we shall be that it is.

   St John says : All things live in him.' In that the Father contemplates
   the Son all creatures take living shape in the Son, that being the real
   life of creatures. Put in another passage St John says : Blessed are
   the dead that have died in God.' -- It seems passing strange that it
   should be possible to die in him who himself said that he is the life !
   -- But see : the soul, breaking through her eternal prototype, is
   plunged in the absolute nothing- ness of her eternal prototype. This is
   the death of the spirit ; for dying is nothing but deprivation of life.
   When the soul realizes that any thing throws her eternal prototype into
   separation and negation of unity, the spirit puts its own self to death
   to its eternal prototype, and breaking through its eternal prototype
   remains in the unity of the divine nature. These are the blessed dead
   that are dead in God. No one can be buried and beatified in the Godhead
   who has not died to God, that is, in his eternal prototype, as I have
   explained.

   Our creed says : Christ rose from the dead : Christ rose out of God
   into the Godhead, into the unity of the divine essence. That is to say
   that Christ's soul and all rational souls, being dead to their
   exemplar, rise from that divine death to taste the joys above it,
   namely the riches of the divine natqrc wherein the spirit is beatified.

   Now consider the fact of happiness. God is happy in him- self; and all
   creatures, which God must make happy, will be so in the same happiness
   that God is happy in, and after the same fashion that he is happy. Be
   sure that in this unity the spirit transcends every mode, even its own
   eternal being, and everything created as well as the equality which, in
   the eternal image, it has with the Father, and together with the Father
   soars up into the

   MEISTER ECKHART

   unity of the divine nature where God conceives himself in absolute
   simplicity. There, in that act, the spirit is no longer creature, it is
   the same as happiness itself, the nature and substance of the Godhead,
   the beatitude of its own self and of all creatures. Further, I hold
   that if God did what he is impotent to do, granted the soul while still
   a creature the knowledge and enjoyment of actual beatitude^ then, were
   the soul to be and to remain happy, it were impossible for God to
   remain God. Anyone in heaven knowing the saints according to their
   happiness, would not have anything to say of any saint but only of God
   ; for happiness is God and all those who are happy arc, in the act of
   happiness, God and the divine nature and substance of God. St Paul says
   : He who being naught, thinketh himself aught, deceiveth himself.' In
   the act of happiness he is brought to naught and no creaturehood exists
   for him. As the worthy Dionysius says : Lord lead me to where thou art
   a nothingness,' meaning : lead me, Lord, to where thou transcendest
   every created intellect ; for as St Paul declares : God dwells in a
   light that no man can approach unto ' ; that is : God is not to be
   discerned in any created light whatever.

   St Dionysius says : God is nothing,' and this is also implied by St
   Augustine when he says : God is everything,' meaning : nothing is
   God's. So that by saying God is nothing ' Dionysius signifies that
   there is no thing in his presence. It follows that the spirit must
   advance beyond things and thingliness, shape and shapenness, existence
   and existences : then will dawn in it the actuality of happiness which
   is the essential possession of the actual intellect.

   I ^ave sometimes said that man sees God in this life in the same
   perfection and is happy in the same perfect fashion as in the life to
   come. Many people are astonished at this. Let us try there- fore to
   understand what it means. Real intellect emanates from the eternal
   truth as intelligence and contains in itself intelligibly all that God
   contains. This noble divinity, the active intellect, conceives itself
   in itself after the manner of God in its emanation, and in its
   essential content it is downright God ; but it is creature according to
   the motion of its nature. This intellect is to the full as noble in us
   now as in the after life.

   Now the question may be asked : How then does this life differ from the

   I answer that, this intellect which is happy in exactly the same way as
   God is, is at present latent in us. In this life we know God only
   according to potentiality . In the after life, when we are quit of
   body, our pptentiality will be all transfigured into the act of
   happiness which belongs to the active intellect. This trans- figuration
   will render the fact of happiness no more perfect than it

   is now ; for active intellect has no accidents nor any capacity to
   receive more than it contains innately. It follows that when wc are
   beatified we shall be completely deprived of potentiality and shall
   conceive happiness only actually, after the manner of the divine
   nature. As David says : Lord in tliy light shall we see light ' : with
   the divine nature we shall conceive the perfection of the divine
   nature, which alone is our entire felicity, here in grace and there in
   perfect happiness.

   THIS IS MEISTER ECKHART FROM WHOM GOD NOTHING HID

   Meister Eckhart said in a sermon. The work wrought by God in the
   God-loving soul which he finds empty and detaclied enough for him to
   bring himself to spiritual birth in her, this work, he said, gives God
   greater pleasure than any w^ork he ever did with any creature and is
   far nobler than the creation of all things from nothing.

   On being asked the reason why this work gives God such pleas- ure, he
   said it was because God has no creature but the soul of large enough
   capacity for him to empty his entire might, the whole ground of his
   being in, as he docs in this act of begetting himself ghostly in the
   soul.

   When asked what God's birth is, he said, God's being born within the
   soul is nothing else than God's self-revelation to the soul in some new
   knowledge and in some new mode.

   Anon they asked him. Does the soul's chief happiness consist in this
   act whereby God gets himself in her in ghostly fashion ? Quoth he,
   Though it is true that God takes greater pleasure in this act than in
   any other deed he ever did concerning creature, natheless the soul is
   happier being re-born into God. God being born in her makes her not
   wholly blessed : she is beatified when, in love and praise, she follows
   this wisdom whercinto she is bom, back to the source from whence it
   came and in their common origin, holding to what is his lets go her
   own, she being happy not in hers but his.

   Meister Eckhart said, A man of godly love and godly fear and perfect
   faith may, an he will, receive God's body every day at the priest's
   hands.

   The question is, what does God do in heaven ? The answer given by the
   saint is this, He crowns his own work : the works God crowns his saints
   for he wrought in them himself.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   Meister Eckhart says, I have Jjeen asked what God is doiiig in heaven ?
   I answer, He has been giving his Son birth eternally, is giving him
   birth now and will go on giving him birth for ever, the Father being in
   childbed in every virtuous soul. Blessed, thrice blessed is the man
   within whose soul the heavenly Father is thus brought to bed. All she
   surrenders to him here she shall enjoy from him in life eternal. God
   made the soul on purpose for her to bear his one-begotten Son. His
   birth in Mary ghostly was to God better pleasing than his nativity of
   her in flesh. When this birth happens nowadays in the good loving soul
   it gives God greater pleasure than his creation of the heavens and
   earth.

   4

   Meister Eckhart says. He who is evcrjrvvhere at home is God- worthy ;
   to him who is ever the same is God present and in him in whom creatures
   arc stilled God bears his one-begotten Son.

   5

   Meister Eckhart says, Holy scripture cries aloud for freedom from self.
   Self-free is self-controlled and self-controlled is self-possessed and
   self-possession is God-possession and possession of everything God ever
   made. I tell thee, as true as God is God and I a man, wert thou quite
   free from self, free from the highest angel, then were the highest
   angel thine as well as thine own self. This method gives self-mastery.

   6

   According to Meister Eckhart, Grace comes not otherwise than with the
   Holy Ghost. It bears the Holy Ghost upon its back. Grace is no
   stationary thing, it is ever-becoming. It is flowing straight out of
   God's heart. Grace does nothing but re-form and convey into God. Grace
   makes the soul deiform. God, the ground of the soul and grace go
   together.

   7

   Query, does God pour his grace into a power of the soul or into her
   essence, for no creature is allowed in the essence of the soul ? The
   answer is that grace is a matter of the soul and naught beside and
   grace without soul is not grace at all. It is immaterial for it is not
   true creature, it is creaturely. Grace to be grace must * have the soul
   for substance for if God poured his grace into a power of the soul that
   power alone would benefit. Not so : he instils it into her essence and
   essence works by grace in all her powers.

   Meister Eckhart says, Practice is better than precept ; but the
   practice and precept of eternal God is a counsel of perfection. If 1
   wanted a teacher of theology I should go for one to Paris, to its
   learned university. But if I came to ask about the perfect life, why
   then he could not tell me. Where then am I to turn ? To pure and
   abstract nature, nowhere else : that can solve thy anxious queries.
   Why, good people, search among dead bones ? Why not seek the living
   sacrum that gives eternal life ? The dead give not nor do they take. An
   angel seeking God as God would look not anywhere for him except in a
   quiet, solitary creature. The essence of perfection lies in bearing
   poverty, misery, despisery, adversity and every hardship that befalls,
   willingly, gladly, freely, eagerly, calm and unmoved and persisting
   unto death without a why.

   9

   Meister Eckhart said, Whatever it be that lights devotion in man's
   heart and knits him closest unto God, that is the best thing for him
   here in time.

   Again he says. To be the heavenly Father's Son one has to be a stranger
   to the world, remote from self, heartwhole and having the mind
   purified.

   O man, renounce thyself and so with toil-free virtue win the prize or,
   cleaving to thyself, with toilful virtues lose it.

   10

   Meister Eckhart says. He who is ever alone is Godworthy and to him who
   is ever at home is God present and in him who stands ever in the
   present now does God the Father bear his Son unceasingly.

   11

   Meister Eckhart says, He to whom (God) is different in one thing from
   another and to whom God is dearer in one thing than another, that man
   is a barbarian, still in the wilds, a child. He to whom God is the same
   in everything has come to man's estate. But he to whom creatures all
   mean want and exile has come into his own.

   He was also asked : Does the man who goes out of himself need to
   trouble at all about his nature ? He answered, God's yoke is easy and
   his burden is light : No, only about his will ; %vhat the tyro fears is
   the expert's delight. The kingdom of God is for none but the thoroughly
   dead.

   God's every infliction is a lure. I give no thanks to God for loving me

   13

   The highest the soul can get to in this life is a settled habitation
   without all in all. Being without all means being detached, perfectly
   free from self and things. Being in all means a state of perpetual rest
   : poise in her eternal idea, in the omniform image shining impartible.

   14

   Eckhart said, There are people upon earth that bear our Lord in spirit
   as his mother did in flesh.

   They asked him who these were ? He answered. They being free from
   things do see in the mirror of truth whereto they are gotten all
   unknowing ; on earth, their dwelling is in heaven and they arc at peace
   ; they go as little children.

   15

   Meister Eckhart said. Better to my mind is the man who in the cause of
   charity will lend himself to taking dole of bread than he who gives an
   hundred marks for charity. How do I make that out ? I argue thus.
   Doctors agree that honour is of far more worth than temporal goods. Now
   he who gives an hundred mar^Ls for charity gets back in praise and
   honour more than his hundred marks' worth. The hand he stretches forth
   with gifts collects both more and better than it gave. But the beggar
   reaching out his hand for bread is bartering his honour ; the giver
   buys honour but the taker sells it.

   Another thing advantages the beggar who receives over the donor of the
   hundred marks to God : the giver glories in and gratifies his nature*,
   the beggar is subduing his and flouting it ; the giver is made much of
   for his gifts, the beggar scorned and shunned fo^ taking them.

   16

   Meister Eckhart said, I never ask God to give himself to me : I beg of
   him to purify, to empty, me. If I am empty, God of his very nature is
   obliged to give himself to me to fill me.

   How to be pure ? By steadfast longing for the one good, God to wit. How
   to acquire this longing ? By self-denial and dislike to creatures ;
   self-knowledge is the way for creatures are all naught, they come to
   naught with lamentation and bitterness.

   God being in himself pure good can nowhere dwell except in the pure
   soul : he overflows into her, whole he flows into her. What does
   emptiness mean ? It means a turning from creatures : the heart uplifted
   to the perfect good so that creatures are no comfort nor is there any
   want of them save inasmuch as the perfect good, God namely, is to be
   grasped therein. The clear eye tolerates the mote no more than does the
   pure soul aught that clouds, that comes between. Creatures as she
   enjoys them are all pure for she enjoys creatures in God and God in
   creatures. She is so limpid she sees through herself ; nor is God far
   to seek : she finds him in herself when in her natural purity she flows
   into the supernatural pure Godhead where she is in God and God in her
   and what she does she does in God and God does it in her.

   17

   Meister Eckhart said, To die the death in love and knowledge, k that is
   more noble and more worth than all the good works put I together that
   holy Christendom has done in love and knowledge from its beginning
   until now and ever shall do till the judgment day. These do but serve
   to bring this dcatli about, this death wherein springs life eternal.

   18

   Meister Eckhart says, We fail to get our way with God because we lack
   two things : profound humility and a telling will. Upon my life I swear
   that God in his divinity is capable of all things but this he cannot
   do, he cannot leave unsatisfied the soul with these two things.
   Wherefore vex not yourselves with trivialities ; ye were not made for
   trivial things and the glory of the world is but a travesty of truth,
   only a heresy of happiness.

   la

   Meister Eckhart being questioned as to God's greatest gift to him
   answered. There are three. First, cessation of carnal desires and
   pleasures. Secondly, divine light enlightens me in everything I do.
   Thirdly, daily I grow and am renewed in virtue, grace and happiness.

   20

   Meister Eckhart says, Lofty aim is lofty nature. The vision of . God is
   a high endeavour, I say, God is omnipotent, but he is powerless to
   thwart the man of meek and mighty aspiration, and any failure on my
   side to get my way with God is due to lack either of will or meekness.

   Meister Eckhart says. As a man gets to be like God and God gets dear
   enough for him to disregard himself and not seek what is his in time or
   in eternity, he is released from all his sins and purgatorial pains,
   yea though he have committed every sin on earth. And this life is
   attainable while yet he eats and drinks. Further he declares, To be the
   heavenly Father's Son we must be strangers to the world, remote from
   self, pure-hearted, inward minded.

   22

   On one occasion Brother Eckhart said, Five things there be which in
   whomsoever has them are sure sign that he will never lapse from God.
   First, though most grievous things befall this man from God or
   creature, never a murmur does he make : no word but praise and thanks
   is ever heard. Again, at the most trying times he never says one word
   in his excuse. Thirdly, this man desires of God what God will freely
   give and nothing else : he leaves it all to him. Fourthly, nothing in
   heaven or earth can ruffle him : so settled is his calm that heaven and
   earth in topsy- turveydom would leave him quite content in God. Fifth,
   nothing in heaven or earth can cheer him ; for having reached the point
   where naught in heaven or earth can sadden him so neither can it
   gladden him, except as trifles can.

   A man remote and far from his own self as the chief angel of the
   Seraphim from him, would have that angel for his own as he is GodJs and
   God is his. And that is the bare truth, as God is God.

   St Paul says : The whole world is the cross to me and I the cross to
   you.'

   sterner fight than that for self-effacement, self-oblivion.

   Brother Eckhart said, Not all suffering is rewarded ; only what is
   cheerfully consented to. A man hanged on the gallows, suffering
   unwillingly, were better pleased that it had been another. There is no
   reward for that. Other sufferings the same. It is not the suffering
   that counts, it is the virtue. -- I say, to him who suffers not for
   love to suffer is suffering and is hard to bear. But one who suffers
   for love suffers not and his suffering is fruitful in God's sight.

   According to Meister Eckhart^ Every sign, every holiness, every
   perfection possible to creature our Lady had par excellence. To take
   her holiness, it was so prodigious that our Lady never sinned. Of
   signs, again, she had the chief one, that of being God's mother ;
   albeit our theologians do contend that our Lady was far happier uniting
   God to Godhead than she was in giving carnal birth to God. As to the
   overfullness our Lady got from deity, she was worthy of it, bearing as
   she did God in the flesh. Soul over- brimming like this overflows into
   the body and makes the body like it, thus she was God's carnal mother.
   Accordingly some doctors do affirm that mental concepts tell upon the
   body more than physicians do with all their drugs. God is never born
   except in souls which have put creatures under their feet. Our philo-
   sophers say, Perfect rest is freedom from all motion.

   On St Peter's words, We have abandoned all things,' Meister Eckhart

   expressible, everything audible, everything visible, then and then only
   we give up all things. When in this^ sense we give up all we grow

   to-day as when they were first made. This owing to their keen
   perception ; the more we know the less we understand.

   81

   In the Book of Wisdom it is writ, All men are fools in whom is no
   knowledge of God for men are mortal without God.' Without divine wisdom
   we are without Gk)d and to be without God is to be without truth for
   God it is who inculcates the truth. Not being in God means being in
   lies and without wisdom. One may be worldly-wise without being
   Godly-wise but this is folly in God's sight ; wisdom wisdomless, more
   foolishness than wisdom. The question is, who has this heavenly wisdom
   ? Meister Eckhart says, He who in deep and real humility so yields
   himself to God that his will is wholly God's will and God's will is
   his, as saith Isaiah the prophet, God teaches true wisdom to none but
   the Jhumble.' And in the Book of Wisdom too we read, Where there is
   meekness there is true wisdom.' Also the heathen doctor Ptolemeus says,
   Among wise men the humblest are the wisest.' According to Meister
   Eekhart, with humility goes love : lowliness without love is dead
   indeed for the virtues are virtue in virtue of love.

   82

   -- And so shall a man order his life if he would be perfect.' Anent
   this Meister Eekhart says. Works wrought from within are pleasant both
   to God and man ; they are benign and living works. They are Godworthy
   for he alone it is who does in man works wrought from within, as saith
   the prophet Isaiah, Lord all our works thou hast wrought in us,' and
   Christ too said, My Father who is in me he doeth that I do.' Such works
   are both easy and pleasant to man for all deeds are agreeable and
   pleasant to man in which body and soul are harmonious. This is the case
   in all these works. Again, these works are living works : the dead
   beast differs from the living one in that the dead is moved from
   outside only ; it must be pulled or pushed, to wit, and its works are
   all dead works. The live beast moves itself where'er it will ; its
   motive power is within and its works are living yorks. In the |same way
   those works of men which have their source within j where God moves by
   himself, essential products, these are our iworks, divine works, useful
   works. But works which come from some external cause and not from inner
   being, these works I say are dead, they are not godly works nor are
   they ours. Meister Eckhart also says, Works wrought from within are
   willing works. But that which is willing is sweet, therefore works from
   within are all pleasant whereas works due to any outward cause are

   Meister Eekhart said, No person x'^an in this life reach the point at
   which he is excused from outward works. What though one lead the
   contemplative life, one cannot altogether keep fromj flowing out and
   mingling in the life of action. Even as a man without a groat may still
   be generous in the will to give, whereas a man of means in giving
   nothing cannot be called generous, so no one can have virtues without
   exercising virtue at the proper time and place. Hence those who lead
   the contemplative life and do no outward works, are most mistaken and
   all on the wrong tack. What I say is that he who lives the
   contemplative life may, nay he must, be absolutely free from outward
   works what time he is in act of contemplation but afterwards his duty
   lies in doing oub.vard works ; for none can live the contemplative life
   without a l-reak and active jife bridges the gaps in the life of
   contemplation.

   84

   Meister Eekhart says and so do other masters, that there are two things
   in God : essence and regard, ix, relatio. According to these doctors,
   not in the Godhead does the Father bear his Son ; the Father in his
   essence does but see into his naked essence where he discerns himself
   in all his power : himself by himself, without the Son and without the
   Holy Ghost ; naught sees he there but the unity of his own essence. But
   the Father being minded to regard himself, to reflect upon himself in
   another Person, by this act of retrospection is begetting his Son ; and
   being well contented with himself in this regard and finding his
   reflection most delightful he must, since all joy is his eternally,
   keep on looking back eternally. So the Son is as eternal as the Father,
   and from the mutual liking and the love betwixt the Father and the Son
   there comes the Holy Ghost and since this love between the Father and
   the Son has been for aye therefore the Holy Ghost is as eternal as the
   Father and the Son and these three Persons have one simple essence and
   are distinct as Persons only : the Father's Person never was the Son's
   nor the Holy Ghost's Person ; all three have each their own Person
   albeit they are one in essence.

   35

   Meister Eekhart says and so do other masters. No man has any merit
   apart from his intention and the why of a man's action/

   feives the measure of his merit, naught beside. Hence anyone ^tending,
   anyone striving, for something less than God is not worthy of God
   unless as the lover of creature, whatever it be, in God. . God-lovers
   have no guerdon but God ; them God rewards with himself.

   86

   Meister Eckhart says, and so do other masters, that in the course of
   nature it is really the higher which is ever more ready to pour its
   power out into the lower than the lower is ready to receive it. The
   highest heaven, for instance, is turning far more rapidly than the rest
   which run against it. However fast the lower heavens race against the
   upper, in order to receive the influx from it, the highest heaven will
   go harder still both as to pace and influx. So God is vastly quicker to
   pour out his grace than man to take it in. There is no dearth of God
   with us ; what dearth there is is wholly ours who make not ready to
   receive his grace.

   37

   The question is, When do the passions perforce obey the mind ?

   ( The answer Meister Eckhart gives is this. What time the mind is fixed
   on God and there abides, the senses arc obedient to the mind. As one
   should hang a needle to a magnet and then another needle on to that,
   until there are four needles, say, depending from the magnet. As long
   as the first needle stays clinging to the magnet all the other needles
   will keep clinging on to that but when the leader drops the rest will
   go as well. So, while the mind keeps«fixed on God the senses arc
   subservient to it but if the mind should wander off from God the
   passions will escape and be unruly.

   38

   Why is it, Meister Eckhart asks, that people are so slow to look for
   God in earnest ? His comment is : When one is looking for a thing and
   finds no trace of its existence one hunts half-heartedly and in
   distress. But lighting on some vestige of the quarry, the chase grows
   lively, blithe and keen. The man in quest of fire, cheered when he
   feels the heat looks for its source with eagerness and pleasure. And so
   it is with those in quest of God : feeling none of the sweetness of God
   they grow listless but sensing the sweetness of divinity they blithely
   pursue their search for God.

   39

   Meister Eckhart asks. Whose are the prayers God always hears ? And
   Meister Eckhart answers. Who worships God as God God hears.

   Meister Eckhart says and so do other masters, Whoso wants a virtue
   ought to seek it at the souree, in God to wit, where we find all the
   virtues added up to virtue. The man who finds a single virtue thus
   diseovers every virtue in the one and, attaining to the unity where all
   virtues are virtue, the soul sees God and God looks on the soul. Soul
   is caressed by God who, talking with her in familiar fashion, teaehes
   her universal wisdom and God and man now fully reeonciled, man is the
   lord of every ereature, of all the good things that have flowed from
   God ; as it is written in the Book of Wisdom where the wise man says,
   All good have I gotten in thee alone ' : in virtue have 1 gotten all
   the virtues.

   41

   According to Meister Eckhart, God is not only the Father of all good
   things but he is the mother of all things to boot. He is Father for he
   is the cause of all things and their creator. He is the mother of all
   things as well, for when creatures have gotten their being from him he
   still stays with creatures to keep them in being. If God did not remain
   with creatures after they had started their own life they would most
   speedily fall out of being. Falling from God means falling from being
   into nothingness. It is not so with other causes, they can with safety
   quit the things they cause when these have gotten being of their own.
   When the house is in being its builder can depart and for the reason
   that it is not the builder alone that makes the house : the materials
   thereof he draws from nature. But God provides creature with the whole
   of what it is, with form as well as matter, so he is bound to stay with
   it or it will promptly drop out of existence.

   Meister Eckhart says, the man who doing some good deed does it not
   wholly for God's sake and without any thought save God, that man
   darkens God's glory. All good works are God's. Hence if a man in his
   good work harbours intent towards aught but God

   he gives thereto the honour of the work and robs God of his glory and
   all such works are sterile and unfruitful.

   43

   The question is, Does the virtue of prayer increase with the outward
   practice of it ? Meister Eckhart says that the external habit adds
   little or nothing to the value of prayer. Prayer is a good thing in
   itself. Now a thing that is good in. virtue of its muchness is not good
   in virtue of itself. One groat has little value all alone but if thou
   hadst a thousand groats that were a handsome property, solely by reason
   of the number. Groats have small value in themselves apart from number.
   And so it is with outward practices : number adds little to the good of
   prayer ; one Ave coming freely from the heart has greater power and
   virtue than a thousand from the lips. And by the same token, no virtue
   dwells in number of good works ; virtue is every whit as fine, as good,
   in one least act of virtue rightly done as in a thousand. Virtue is not
   enhanced by multiplying outward acts of virtue, for were it good from
   number it would not then be good in its own right. A thing good in
   itself is good in its oneness not in its multi- plication. True virtue
   means virtuous works wrought virtuously. Who gives an alms in God's
   name but gives it grudgingly and not with cheerful heart, what though
   he do a virtuous deed, he does not do it virtuously. And so with prayer
   or any other virtue : done rightly it is virtue but not else. Take
   patience for example. External suffering does not make one patient : it
   merely tries one's patience, as fire will try a penny whether it be of
   silver or of copper. The pa,tient man is patient still though outward
   suffering n'er befall. And prayer the same. The man of pure heart
   Godward turned who never does a stroke of outward work is nathcless in
   good case for hearts are not made pure by outward prayers : prayer
   rises pure from out pure hearts.

   Doctors declare that God moves all things, i.e. all creatures, but
   creatures cannot move God. God can move creatures for he has created
   all creatures and it is he who keeps them in existence. But creatures
   cannot move God : no creature can affect God, according to the
   universal law that the lower does not flow into the higher. Now
   creatures are inferior to God so they do not influence God, ergo, they
   do not move God.

   In this connection some enquirers ask how God can move creatures and
   not be defiled by creatures which are full of fault ? The masters
   answer. If, as we see,'^the sun can shine on mire and

   filth without contamination then how much more can God protect himself
   from any taint of creature. But Meister Eckhart argues in a different
   fashion. He says God is in all things but so as to be wholly outside
   things, hence faults in creatures will not affect God. Just as we see
   the soul whole in the eye and at the same time whole outside the eye
   for she is whole in every limb ; no blemish of the eye can touch the
   soul which is in suchwise wholly in the eye as to be independent of the
   eye. Even so God in creature is wholly without creature, untouched and
   untainted by creature.

   There is another answer Meister Eckhart gives : God is only in the
   essence (or being) of a creature. His argument runs thus. Essenee is
   without defect, defect being nothing but a lapse from being. Now seeing
   no defect can touch the essence and God is only in the essence of a
   creature therefore God is unaffected by the defects of creature.
   Regarding this amazing fact of deity John Chrysostom observes : That
   God is in all creatures we know and declare but how and in what manner
   we do not understand.' Yet Meister Eckhart says it is quite plain if
   for the word God we put the word being. We see and have abundant proof
   that being is in all things. But if actual being is God it follows then
   that God must be in all things.

   45

   Thus saith the wise man in the Book of Wisdom, Eternal wisdom is
   omnipotent for it is one.' Upon which Meister Eckhart com- ments thus.
   The simpler a thing is the more powerful and effective it is. We can
   demonstrate it thus. In a thing made of parts the power of the thing
   resides in its parts. In a house made of walls, foundations and roof,
   the whole force of the house consists in these parts. If the house
   could but draw from its oneness the virtue it gets from its walls then
   it need have no walls. Now God is the simplest possible good wherein
   all things are one and as one he is therefore omnipotent. Again, the
   heathen doctors say that power dispersed is dissipated. It is so with
   the mind. Scattered in multitudinous creature it is so much more feeble
   and infirm toward God. But when the mind gets rid of creatures, when
   all the senses vanish into mind, then mind and passions being met in
   one the mind is strong enough to wrest from God whatever it desires.
   When man does what is in him not even God can say him nay.

   In one of his sermons Meister Eckhart said. It is my humility that
   gives God his divinity and the proof of it is this. God's peculiar
   property is giving. But God cannot give if he has nothing to receive
   his gifts. Now I make myself receptive to his gifts by

   my humility so I by my humility do make God giver and since giving is
   God's own peculiar property I do by my humility give God his property.
   The would-be giver must needs find a taker ; without a taker he cannot
   be a giver for it is the taker by his taking that makes the man a
   giver. So God, to be the giver, must discover a receiver. Now none but
   the humble can receive the gift of God. So God, to use his godlike
   power of giving, will eke need my humility ; without humility he cannot
   give me aught for I without humility cannot accept his gift. Thus it is
   true that I by my humility do give God his divinity.

   47

   Meister Eckhart also said, My lowliness raises up God and the lower I
   humble myself the higher do I exalt God and the higher I do exalt God
   the more gently and sweetly he pours into me his divine gift, his
   divine influx. For the higher the inflowing thing the more easy and
   smooth is its flow. How God is raised upon my lowliness I argue thus :
   the more I abase and keep myself down the higher God towers above me.
   The deeper the trough the higher the crest. In just the same way, the
   more I abase and 1 humble myself the higher God goes and the better and
   easier he f pours into me his divine influx. So it is true that I exalt
   God by ' my lowliness.

   48

   Meister Eckhart says. We ought not to have to ask God for his grace,
   his divine goodness, we ought to contrive to take it ourselves withor^t
   asking. God has gotten himself in his divine outflow just as the
   flowing. . . .

   Meister Eckhart points out how Isaias says, Thy light is come to thee,
   the light which is eternal, unchangeable and new and inconceivable,
   free and thine own ; well may thy heart both wonder and rejoice.'

   The question is, how is it light if it is inconceivable ? How does it
   come if it is immoveable ? How be called thine if it is free ? I answer
   first. That light is God which is light in itself and which is light in
   all created things and wherein all creatures are light. For to begin
   with I contend that light has the peculiar property of being clear and
   luminous in itself and in others revelation. But this belongs
   exclusively to God. Wherefore I say the light in itself is God. The
   second point is argued thus. If everything caused is a manifestation of
   the first cause then light of intellect in us is surely God ; no mind
   can see the naked truth in a created

   light for nothing gives what it has not got. Augustine says, * Our mind
   can only see the naked truth in light which is perfectly simple and
   pure, God, to wit.' The third is proved as follows. If creature is
   light and God is light, as has been shown before, then creaturely being
   is merely a light in light-being. But one light in another produces but
   one light, so it is true.

   -- Talking of light, now if so be that in this life our minds can see
   the naked truth by means of the light that is God, then it is also true
   that man may here see God and needs must it be true withal that man is
   here beatified.*

   I answer that, albeit here a man may see the truth by means of the
   light that is God natheless he sees not what God is, using this light
   as a means. I say, what though he see God as he is, he is not yet
   beatified for God as a means is germane to creature. Look you, God
   beatifies not as being the beginning (when he is of the nature of all
   things), not yet as being the mean (where he is of the nature of a
   creature), nor even as the end (for then again he is all things),
   neither does he beatify as being all of these but he beatifies just
   inasmuch as he transcends them all ; he beatifies as being God
   impartible, as being simply pure light in itself.

   If thou shouldst ask, How is he light, being incomprehensible ? ' I
   answer. Being incomprehensible therefore he is the light. I say,
   moreover, incomprehensibility is the light nature and this is plain,
   for his incomprehensibility comes from his unendingness. But his
   unendingness is due to his simplicity, to his purity (or clarity),
   which constitutes lightness in God. It is well said then, God is light.
   But know, this vision of the truth in the divine light is gotten in no
   school of creatures, it is learnt in the school of renouncement, of
   utter detachment from creatures, and for such lore the school is
   heaven, the book thy empty heart, eternity thy reading, thy mentor
   uncreated light and truth thy mentor too. This David meant when he
   declared, Lord in thy light shall we see the light.'

   Then take the second question. How does he come who is without motion
   and how does he come who is without place ? To whom does he come who is
   in all hearts ?

   I answer, He does not come as anything at all nor yet as gaining
   something for himself but he comes ordering ; he who was hidden comes
   and reveals himself. He comes as the light which lay concealed in
   people's hearts and in their minds, now taking shape in intellect and
   will and in the deepest being of the soul. He is in the inner man in
   such a way that there is naught without him and there is naught there
   with him : he is there all by himself. He comes, appearing in the mind
   and in the will, nothing at all without him, nothing at all with him
   but mind and will are full

   of him alone. There seems nothing with him, nothing without him ; the
   mind is but the place of God, a Godstead to itself and nothing more, as
   David sings, Lord the light of thy countenance is risen upon us ' as
   though to say, Holding thy peace, with sighing and with rue do thou by
   means of intellect turn thy will round to feel the charm of God.
   Converse with him as man to man and as thou dost discourse with God in
   the first person and of God in the third so do thou talk to God in the
   second Periion. Forgetting everything, aware of God alone, say unto
   him, Thou art my God, thou only art within, thou only art all things.'
   Creatures are not receptive to God, except those that are made in the
   image of God, like angels and man's soul : these being God- receptive
   he is in them and they in him. To others God is essential, not that
   they have gotten him but simply that they have no being without him.
   Not in virtue of his presence do they see him, does she see God in her
   innermost depth ; nor is it by his power for he is powerless apart from
   her ; but we can do nothing without him. God being in the soul as in
   himself therefore the soul is called a place and soul is also called
   the place of peace for where God is as it were in himself there is the
   kingdom of heaven and peace untroubled, joyous and delightful. The
   blest soul is at rest in God as in her own, and more so.

   A man who has gone clean out of himself straightway finds God in God
   and God with God. He behaves like him for what he is he is to God and
   what he is to God God is to him : God belongs wholly to him and is
   wholly he and he is wholly in God and is downright God they being so
   entirely the same, one cannot be without the other.

   The soul is no different from Christ save that the soul has a born
   nature and a created nature. This Christ has not in his eternal Person.
   If the soul doffed her born nature and her created nature she would be

   easy to doff the creature for this is a labour of love and the greater
   the pain the greater the joy.

   to abandon creature and escape from self. Ilarkee. Love creature as I
   may in God never can I love God in creature as perfectly as in myself.
   Thou hast to go out of thyself into thyself again ; there lies the home
   of truth which none may find who looks for it in outward things. Mary
   Magdalene, when she left creatures and betook herself into her heart,
   found there our Lord. God is unmixed and pure : I can find God then
   only in the pure. But my interior soul is more undefiled and pure than
   any creature ; so my best chance of finding God is down in my own soul.
   And eke I am the life in God for All that is in the Father is the life
   in him,' John said. In this guise does the Father bear the Son and in
   this selfsame birth I do proceed from him. Now he declares the Son to
   be in him, in the very depth of his heart. But since all that was made
   in him is the life in him therefore I am this life in the innermost
   heart of God. And the life was the light of men,' said John. Mark you,
   he says the divine light in us is our light wherein we see all things
   conceived in the mind,

   God is being, perfect being, without which are no beings ; for all
   beings are from his being. May we be this same being. So help us God.

   According to Meister Eckhart, there are seven degrees of con-
   templation. Whoso would practise contemplation let him seek out a quiet
   spot and set himself to thinking, first, how noble his soul is, how she
   has flowed straight out of God, a thought that fills him with a great
   delight. Having well cogitated this, *next let him think how God must
   love his soul to make it in the likeness of the Trinity, so that all
   God is by nature he may be by grace ; whereat he will delight perforce
   more vehemently still for it is far more noble to be made in the form
   of the Trinity than merely to come straight from God. -- In the third
   stage he meditates that he has been beloved of God for aye ; the
   Trinity has been for aye and God has loved the soul for aye. --
   Fourthly, he reflects that God did ever charge him to enjoy with God
   what God has aye enjoyed and always shall, God himself namely. At the
   fifth stage the soul enters into herself and knows God in herself,
   which happens in this wise : No being can be without being and being
   feeds on being ; but being cannot live upon this food till this food is
   converted to the same blessed nature as that which feeds upon it and
   this applies to being which is being-of-itself. But there is no
   being-of-itself excepting God, So my soul is living on nothing but God.
   And by entering into oneself like this one finds God in oneself. If God
   will that I faint not he must give me being. No

   being can stand without God so if he means me to have being theii he

   The sixth stage is, soul knows hersdf in God. As thus. Every- thing in
   God is God. Now my idea has always been in God, is still and ever shall
   be, therefore my soul is ever one with God and is God and I do find
   myself in God in the exalted fashion oi being God in God eternally.
   This brings the expert soul ineffable delight.

   At the seventh stage the soul knows God in himself as being without
   beginning whence all things emanated. This gnosis comes to no man fully
   in this life for it means the beholding of God. a thing not of this
   world.

   What the joy of the Lord is none can tell. But mark this much

   any mode, nay, I divest it of all mode for he himself is modeless mode
   who is and is glad because he is. This is the joy of the Lord and is
   the Lord himself. W^hite is not black nor is aught naught. From naught
   naught can be taken, From aught aught can be taken and it is wholly
   thus with God, Of aught that is wholly in God naught remains. Soul
   joined to God has in him once for all all that is at all in absolute
   perfection. There soul forgets things and herself, as she is in
   herself, waking up in God, godlike as God in her, so much in love with
   self in him, so indiscriminately one with him, she enjoys naught but
   him, delighting in him. What more should she know or desire ?

   God being still sets everything going. So desirable a thing starts them

   God can no more abide his likes than he could abide not being God.
   Likeness is not a thing that can belong to God. There is sameness in

   The first work of God in the soul is the birth of his Son in the soul
   and from this act his other gifts do flow into the soul, as grace and
   virtue. What God can do in the soul is to bring forth his Son in the
   soul and this must needs be. It is characteristic of God that he cannot
   refrain, he must beget his Son in me and in you all. I say, God begets
   me his Son and so say I of you all as well. That we are all born of God
   his Son, is nothing wonderful ; we can see this with creatures. Now
   mark my words, I say, this man is the not ; I am not what you are and
   you are not what I am. Suppress the not and we are just the same ; take
   naught from creatures and creatures are all the same. The remainder is
   one. What is this one ? It is the Son the Father bears. To be the
   actual Son the Father bears we must cancel the naught of creatures.
   This naught which all creatures are e\imbers a man and stops him being
   the very Son begotten of the Father. God bids us part with naught so as
   to be the selfsame Son the Father bears. For this man must be one ; he
   must escape from images and forms ere he can be the actual Son the
   Father brings to birth ; he must be rid of everything, not merely alien
   things, but eke his own ; for God's Son and man's son are not two sons,
   they are one Son, one nature ; so it behoves a man to flee from other
   natures as well as from his own and stand in the bare nature of the Son
   in the Godhead, in that only. What I say is that if one is to be the
   actual Son the Father bears one must give up own nature altogether. --
   But many people have natures so alien to their own, how then can they
   surrender their own nature ? ' -- We always must surrender our own
   natures in order to become the very Son the Father bears. As St Paul
   says, Wc must be changed into his Son.' In other words, the Son alone
   being beloved of the Father, what- ever things the Father loves he must
   love in his Son and inas- much as we become this Son the Father bears
   we do be changed into his Son of love and are his very Son. Of this be
   sure. God will love them in us and in all creatures in the guise of his
   alone- begotten Son. Provided we abandon naught, become estranged from
   naught. We must relinquish all things, must forget all

   The uppermost soul-face has two acts. By one she knows God, his gift

   only by the fact of knowing God. Fifthly, it tends towards the exemplar
   whence it came. Two things adorn this image. The one, its being arrayed
   like him. The other, its having in it a somewhat of eternity. The soul
   has three powers. Not in them lies the image. But she owns a single
   power, namely, the active intellect. Now according to Augustine and the
   New Philosophers, memory, understanding and will are found herein
   together, nor can these three be told apart. This is the secret image
   answering to God, God shining straight into this image.

   It is God's will that we be holy and that we do what makes us holy.
   Holiness is a matter of will and wisdom. According to the best
   authorities holiness lies in the ground, in the summit of the soul,
   where soul is in her cause, where she has outgrown names and her own
   powers withal. For powers too are the defi- ciency. We cannot give a
   name to God, nor can we name the soul in her own nature. The point
   where these twain meet is holiness.

   Essence is so noble it gives being to all things. Were there no essence

   hell, what would^t thou say to that ? ' -- To cast me into hell ? '
   quoth he, that would spite himself ! Yet if he cast me into hell I
   should still have two arms to clasp him with. One arm is true humility
   and this I should put under him, embracing him the while with the other
   arm of love. Better,' he said, to be in hell with God than be in heaven
   without him.'

   Said Meister Eckhart to a beggar, Good morrow, brother.' The same to
   you Sir, but I never have bad ones.' -- How so, brother ? ' he asked.
   -- All God gives me to bear I eheerfully suffer for his sake deeming
   myself unworthy, so never am I sad or sorry.' -- Where didst thou find
   God first ? ' he asked. -- Leaving all creatures I found God.' -- Where
   didst thou leave God, brother ? ' he said. --

   In every man's pure heart.' -- What manner of man art thou, brother ? '
   quoth he. -- I am a king,' he said. -- Of what ? ' he queried. -- Of my
   own flesh. Whatsoever my spirit desires of God my flesh is more eager,
   more ready to do and to bear than my mind to accept.' -- Kings have
   kingdoms,' he said : where is thy realm, brother ? ' -- In my own
   soul.' -- How so, brother ? ' he asked. -- When, having locked the
   doors of my five senses,

   I am desiring God with all my heart then do I find God in my soul as
   clearly and as joyful as he is in life eternal.' -- He said, Granting
   thee holy, who made thee so brother ? ' -- Sitting still and thinking
   deep and keeping company with God has gotten me to heaven, for never
   could I rest in aught inferior to God. Now having found him I have
   peace and do rejoice eternally in him and that is more than any
   temporal kingship. No outward act however perfect but hinders the
   interior life.'

   68

   Meister Eckhart met a lovely naked boy. He asked him whence he came. He
   said, I come from God.' -- Where hast thou left him ? ' -- In virtuous
   hearts.' -- Whither away ? ' -- To God.' -- Where wilt thou find him ?
   ' -- Leaving all creatures.' -- Who art thou ? ' -- A king.' -- Where
   is thy kingdom ? ' -- In my own heart.' -- Mind no one shares it with
   thee.' -- So I do.' He took him to his cell and said, Take any coat
   thou wilt.' -- Then I should be no king ' (said he), and vanished.

   It was Gk)d himself that he had had with him a little spell.

   answered, I do not know.' -- Why do you not know ? ' he enquired. --
   Because,' she said, I am not either virgin or [Spouse, not man nor wife
   nor widow nor lady nor lord nor wench nor thrall.' The porter went off
   to Meister Eckhart. Do come out,' h^said, to the strangest wight that
   ever I heard and let me come too and you put your head out and say, Who
   is asking for me ? ' He did so. She said to him what she had said to
   the porter. Quoth he, My child, thou hast a shrewd and ready tongue, I
   prithee now thy meaning ? ' -- An I were virgin,' she replied, I were
   in my first innocence ; spouse, I were bearing the eternal Word within
   my soul unceasingly ; were I a man I should grapple with my faults ;
   wife, should be faithful to my husband. Were I a widow I should be ever
   yearning for my one and only love ; as lady I should render fearful
   homage ; as wench I should be living in meek servitude to God and to
   all creatures and as thrall I should be working hard, doing my best
   tamely to serve my Master. Of all these things I am no single one who
   am the one thing as the other running thither.' The doctor went away
   and told his students, I have been listening to the most perfect person
   I ween I ever met.'

   MEISTER ECKHART'S FEAST

   Meister Eckhart tells how once upon a time there came a beggar to
   Cologne on Rhine in quest of poverty and the life of truth. Accosted
   him a noble dame, Eat with me, brother, of God's charity ! ' --
   Gladly,' quoth he. When they were seated she encouraged him, Eat
   heartily, be not ashamed.' -- 'Tis wrong,* he said, to eat too much, to
   eat too little is wrong too ; the just mean lies between : I will eat
   as a beggar.' -- What is a beggar ? ' she asked. -- ^He said, It means
   three things. First, being dead to natural things. Next, not having
   inordinate desire of posses- sions. Thirdly, begrudging suffering to
   everyone except oneself.' -- Tell me,' she questioned, what is poverty
   of the inner man ? ' -- That also means three things,' he said. First,
   complete detachment from creatures, which arc out of God, in time and
   in eternity. Secondly, abject humility of the outward and the inward
   man. Thirdly, an active interior life ; the mind un- ceasingly wrought
   up to God.' -- What is poverty of spirit ? ' she asked. -- You want to
   know too much,' he said. -- I can never know too much,' said she, of
   God's glory and man's happiness.' -- True,' he returned. That again
   means three things. First,

   not knowing aught but God in time and in eternity. Secondly, not
   seeking God outside oneself. Thirdly, not owning any pro- perty that
   one conveys from place to place.' -- But surely Meister Eckhart, our
   father, must get from out his cell the sermons he preaches from his
   pulpit ? ' -- Not he,* he said. -- Whence then ?/ (she asked). -- The
   more temporal the more personal, the more personal the more temporal.*
   -- I trow,* she said, this guest is not out of Bohemia.' ^ Quoth he,
   The sun that shines here in Cologne is shining also in the town of
   Prague.' -- Explain,^ she begged. He said, 'Tis not my place with
   Meister Eckhart present.' Meister Eckhart said, He who knows nothing of
   the truth from within, if he woo it without shall find it too within.*
   -- The reckoning is paid,' she cried. And he : Lady, you furnish the
   wine.* -- I am not loath,* she answered, an you ask me.'

   (So Meister Eckhart asked her), Wherein do we divine the work- ing of
   the Holy Ghost within our souls ? * She answered, In three things.
   First, in the waning day by day of personal things, desires and natural
   love. Next, in the waxing of divine love and of grace from day to day.
   Last, in the eager charity which moves us to bestir ourselves on our
   fellow-man's behalf before our own.' Quoth he, Our Lord's friends prove
   it.* Anon he asked, How does the spiritual man divine God's presence at
   his orisons or exercises ? ' She answered, By three things. First, by
   the object he sets before his chosen, world scorn and body suffering,
   to wit. Next, by a growth in grace commensurate with the love betwixt
   himself and God. The third one is th^it God does never leave him
   without hint of some fresh truth.' -- That is, of course, the case,' he
   said. Now tell me, how does he know if what he does is wholly in
   accord- ance ?with the sovran will of God ? * She answered, By three
   things. First, clear consciousness never fails him. Secondly, he has
   union with God without break. Thirdly, the heavenly Father keeps giving
   his Son birth in him, in inspiration.' Quoth Meister Eckhart, Were
   every reckoning as well paid as this one for the wine there's many a
   soul in purgatory would tliis day be in life eternal.* Whereon the
   mendicant chimed in, What more remains it is the Doctor's turn to pay.*
   -- Leave the old to their age,' pro- tested Meister Eckhart. -- Then
   love shall settle it,' the beggar said, that never faileth.'

   Quoth the lady, Prithee father, how does one know oneself the heavenly
   Father's child ? ' He answered, By three things. First, one does
   everything for love. Next, one takes everything the same from Go^.
   Thirdly, one has no hope in anyone but God.*

   Quoth the beggar, Prithee father, how are we to tell if virtue is doing
   her perfect work in us ? ' He answered, By three things, love of God
   for God's sake, good for good's sake, truth for truth's sake.'

   Quoth the Doctor, My children, how lives the teacher of the truth ? '
   The lady said, He practises what he preaches.' The beggar cried,
   Agreed. But the truth in his heart no words can say.'

   As the eternal Word is the birth of the heavenly Father, so is the will
   of God the birth and the becoming of all creatures.

   1. Here the disciple is supposed to question his master, saying,

   Tell me, could God an he would have made all things as good as he is
   himself ? ' The master said, Yes, what God wills he can do. -- Are
   things all made of his own nature ? ' The master said. No.

   2. The disciple inquired, What is the soul made of ? ' -- She is made
   out of nothing. -- Where did God get the nothing he made the soul out
   of ? ' -- Some say he got it in himself. That is not the case for in
   God is not nothing : that which is in God is God. -- But God has all
   things in himself and without God is nothing. Surely then he gets this
   nothing out of himself ? ' -- The master said, No, not at all ! He gets
   it neither in himself nor out of himself, nor above himself nor below
   himself. There is no getting nothing from inside or out. If it were
   gotten anywhere it would not be nothing. Anything that docs this :
   takes nothing from nowhere and makes of it something, is God. So runs
   the argument that the nothing is gotten from nowhere. They asked St
   Augustine about this mysterious nothing out of which the soul is made
   and where, apart from place, this nothing hides ? His explanation was
   that this nothing is openly enclosed in betwixt God and God- head, in
   his almighty power. Were it in close confinement it would not be naught
   : it either would have ))lace or else be God by nature, the soul being
   made of the nature of God. But it is not. Ergo, this nothing is at
   large in the almighty power of the Father to whom it is as easy to get
   from nowhere naught as aught. It is confined to his omnipotence to be
   able to take naught from nowhere and from it create aught. Whatever can
   do this is God.

   3. Now another question. Dionysius says, Tell me, what about the soul
   who is in full enjoyment of her rights : what is it that she has by
   rights at the height of her perfection ? -- By rights the soul has
   knowledge : clear understanding of all things and is so mellowed by
   love as to be all unwitting, when people love and hate her, whether she
   be not dearer to her haters than her lovers. And this soul has by
   rights absolute freedom from herself and things : sunk in the sovran
   good she cannot find herself at all. Here we have two natures. One, the
   thing that sinks ; the other, what it sinks in. She sinks eternally but
   never touches bottom. This

   446

   MEISTER ECKHART

   sinking shows her two things. In sinking from herself she is more God
   than creature. The fact that she does sink proclaims her creaturely for
   deity sinks not. -- But when she has yielded her aught to his aught and
   her naught is subsisting in naught, then what will belong to her aught
   and her naught ? -- None can tell, but she has no more than her rights.
   That is the answer.

   4. Another question is, has the soul more enjoyment in the source of
   joy or in the vision of its wonders ? -- Consider what she has in each.
   In admiring its wonders she obeys the selfsame wondrous law that the
   first cause laid down for all causes as befitting each. But soul does
   not stop here, she transcends wonder. The wonders have become her
   potential being. Hence her enjoyment is much keener in the source of
   joy than in tlie beholding of its wonders. In the source is her abode,
   not in its wondrous vision. There all wonders end ; there all is one to
   her and one in all. That is the answer to this question.

   5. The question is, if the Godhead has all things how comes it then
   neither to give nor to beget ? If it does not beget it is not Father.
   -- The explanation is this. Man's nature is called man- hood, and
   manhood as such neither acts nor begets ; it acts and begets in a human
   person. And the same with Godhood : it is all-containing and yet not
   active and productive in itself. What it does is all done by the
   Persons in person and nature. The God- head is called fruitful inasmuch
   as it is brought forth in the Persons in Person and essence.

   6. An angel may do three things in the soul. Either he con- fronts her
   with the scriptures or with the holy life or, again, with the e?camplc
   of Christ Jesus, showing her something clearly as though in a mirror
   wherein one may espy some blemish on the human face and so proceed to
   cure it. Thus she sees herself, what she still lacks ; where she is not
   as yet all that she ought to be ; what things to leave and what to keep
   ; how much or little she should be to things : all this she plainly
   sees. And whatever an angel can do the devil may very well copy. --
   Have we no means of telling. Sir, if it is an angel or the devil ? ' --
   Yes, they are very different. Tests for angel and the devil are as
   follows. Anything an angel does is done in the light, orderly and
   clearly, and the soul rejoices in the amiable presence of the angel ;
   also it is a sign to know him by that she is left with a sense of
   pleasure. In counter- feiting this the devil makes it vague, confused,
   ambiguous, and the soul, affrighted at this haunting of the fiend, is
   restless and depressed and by this she may know it is the devil.

   The angel talks virtue to the soul, the fiend talks virtue too but God
   does not talk virtue. -- For the love of God, good Sir, tell us what
   you mean.' -- 1 will explain. The angel talks virtue to the

   LIBER POSITIONUM

   447

   soul and his talk (the angel's), which is of necessary virtue, is
   friendly and persuasive, something in this fashion : See, there is
   still this to go and that to do and the other to leave off ' : orderly
   counsel and plain and the soul finds peace in complying with his words.
   The devil talks virtue too, but he urges superfluous virtues : too much
   fasting and watching and kneeling, too much weeping, and his counsels
   are more in the nature of commands, as thus : Do this or that or thou
   art damned,' or art not good nor perfect.' An orgy of uncontrolled
   virtues with no definite aim, that is his cue and the soul is
   affrighted within her and gleans no satisfaction from his words. -- But
   God's talk is not of virtue though it is wonderful talk. The burden of
   it a fair Word that is passing good to hear. The Holy Ghost goes before
   the angel and embracing the soul prepares her to receive what the angel
   has to say ; and the Son gives wisdom and order to the words and God
   the Father help and consummation to that which is spoken in the soul.
   Thus God does not talk virtue in the soul ; he forestalls the angel and
   prepares the soul, giving wisdom, order and achievement to the angelic
   utterance in the soul ; the Holy Trinity all work together in her
   without speaking.

   7. The statement that our Lord from time to time holds con- verse with
   good people and that they hear words or become im- pressed with the
   sense of certain sayings such as, Thou art mine elect, or my beloved ;
   thou shalt never leave me and I will never leave thee,' and the like,
   things like this, I say, should be accepted with reserve and judged
   upon their merits for locutions of this kind are often due to a trick
   the soul has, when indulging in comfortable intuitions of divinity, of
   answering herself by a sort of reflex action. When the soul, aflood
   with God, is void and free from sensible affections she grows apace in
   created light till nothing transcends her but intellect and essential
   knowledge. In this detachment the knower is the known ; out of her own
   light she creates what, she desires. Such is the effect of the
   benignant reign of essential understanding. Aristotle says in the third
   book of The Soul, Every immaterial substance or isolated form is in
   itself both the knower and the known,' and this is why the soul, cut
   off from the corporal things by the encircling flood of God, draws
   deiform truth out of her own self. It follows that anything in her of
   which she has a rational perception is not said by God : God's speech
   is none other than the perfect image of divine truth wherein the spirit
   is caught up out of its selfhood, past under- standing, into intellect.
   There in unity she understands without understanding.

   8. To drag the hawthorn through the hay without a catch we must lop it
   well, like our Lord Jesus Christ, the tree of love, who

   dragged the hawthorn through the hay of this wicked world, so shorn of
   all its branches that no moving thing could cling thereto and so he
   gathered up nothing that was unstable. And to attain to him we must be
   too bare for things to cling to us or we to them. We take up our cross
   when stripping everything of self and self of everything we cling all
   pure and naked to the bare cross of Christ.

   9. He who loves aright loves not nor is not loved. They love and are
   beloved who can be pleased and pained : they pour out themselves in
   love on creatures and creatures back on them. But they love not nor are
   they loved who are not moved by creature good and ill ; these neither
   give nor do they take ; they pour not out on creature nor creature back
   on them. They love not neither are they loved. We ought to love God out
   of love. They love in love who love for why : who love him for some
   bodily or temporal good. But they love out of love who love without a
   why ; who do not love for temporal good nor yet eternal : they love him
   merely for himself, for his own sake pure and simple apart from
   anything he gives.

   10. We read of John the Baptist that he was a prophet. He was more than
   prophet for when the Holy Ghost from time to time spake by the prophets
   they were thereafter as they were before, in sinful habit. Prophets are
   people who are now and then con- strained to play this part. While the
   Holy Ghost is speaking through them by actual infusion of his grace
   they are exercising virtue and thereafter they revert to their former
   habit : they are called virtuous as practising virtue intermittently :
   they do right and also wrong. Not so St John ; he was more than prophet
   for he practised virtue not at intervals, it was his natural and
   settled wont. And those who follow him in this are not prophets either,
   they are more than prophets, seeing as they do in the clear light of
   God exactly what to do and what to leave undone and having given them
   the Godlike power to act up to their lights with effortless,
   spontaneous delight and delightful spontaneity. These are called
   virtuous not because they practise virtue intermittently : they are
   fixed and established in it. That thing is habitual which we do at one
   time and at another not ; it is an alternation. That is not habitual
   which is continuous and without admixture.

   11. A good man is known by three things. One is singleness of will :
   all we call nature his will is free from. The second is clear
   understanding : any mental knowledge that she has his soul has fully
   mastered : she either approfounds it here or yonder in the common
   groilnd during illumination. The third is peace of mind : such images
   as may occur therein are nd hindrance to the soul;

   12. Three things distinguish the solitary soul. The first is,

   [Picture 477]

   Image of page 0473 #seq_0473 w {
   background-image:url(/ccel/pfeiffer/eckhart1/files/0473.jpg)}

   LIBER POSITIONUM 449

   cessation of desire : no more wants or sense of deficiency. The second
   is, active love for and acquiescence in the will of God. The third is a
   lively feeling in the soul of the love of the Holy Ghost.

   18. Divine good in the singular no body or blood receives but it does
   receive God's manifold goodness. It is simple divine good for the
   spirit to be rapt out of itself into God's oneness, there to understand
   without sensible perception. But God's manifold goodness means anything
   revealed to her in form and likeness, for this is all a matter of the
   mortal nature. -- The heavenly Father gives his consolation to none but
   the man of peaceful heart, Christ said to his disciples, My peace I
   give unto you.'

   14. Let no one claim to have received the perfect gift of the Holy
   Ghost, who can be shaken in his convictions by any arguments that are
   disquieting. I refer to things which are spoken contrary to our
   knowledge of eternal truth.

   15. Nature comes with God into creature and driving God out remains
   alone in creature. Spirit goes with creature into God and driving
   creature out stays by itself in God. The most perfect mode of soul is
   one of self-oblivion in good works as a whole and the way thereto is
   the clear discernment of special imperfections. In the least of mortal
   quests there is at stake all natural creature appetite. Effortless
   achievements are wiped out of the mind as though they had not been. It
   is true wisdom to recognise the folly of evil and the freedom of
   perfection.

   18. Hosea the prophet, rapt in wonder, had a threefold marvel shown
   him. The first one was, how God is one in essence and three in Person.
   The second marvel, which, though somewhat less is still ineffable and
   incomprehensible to creature, is this^ how two natures meet together in
   one Person. The tliird marvel is the marvel of marvels : how creator is
   creature and creature is creator. The prophet Hosea says, His going
   forth is prepared as the morning ; he shall come unto us as the soft
   evening rain.' Here the morning light suggests the nearness of his
   coming : the dawn is the herald of the day. The day dawns thrice. First
   in the chamber of the Person of the Father. Next, in the chamber of the
   Person of the Son. Thirdly, in the world. The first dawn was the will
   of the Father ; the second, the obedience of the Son ; the third one
   broke when their common Spirit caught the precious most pure
   blood-drops that ever flowed from the virgin heart of Mary. The fire of
   love once kindled, he no longer tarries : day is here.

   20. Suppose a man insults me and I silence him by my retort, it is not
   I who conquer : I am conquered. I conquer if, in true humility, I hold
   my peace. Conquering we are conquered and being conquered conquer.

   MEISTER ECKHART

   21. It is a question if angels grow in heaven ? I declare they do. They
   go on growing till the day of judgment, waxing in knowledge and in love
   ; by then th^ lowest is about as wise as the highest was when he was
   created. -- But tell me Sir, does the soul grow in heaven as well ? '
   -- I say. No. -- But why. Sir, should the angel grow and not the soul ?
   ' -- For this reason. The soul grows in the body and when she quits the
   body that is her judgment day : the highest she has reached by then is
   the nearest she will ever get to knowing God. But her growth is far
   nobler than an angel's for what an angel has comes by no effort of his
   own ; hers is the reward of toil so that one light of hers is worth ten
   of any angel's.

   22. Three kinds of progress take place in serious people. The first is
   natural ; when, fought to a finish, man's nature is van- quished and
   subdued, then at length he sees all random thoughts as things he can
   turn to his account and we to ours. Not a single notion but will serve
   to bring light to pious people, and this (light) is essential almost as
   much as natural ; essential, though by grace, a divine repugnance to
   all base inventions. -- The second kind of progress is unconscious. The
   man is spiritualised so that his words, his ways and his whole self
   enlighten other people with a realization of their own shortcomings.
   Nature sleeping, spirit wide awake, that I call light and she is a
   light not alone to other people but the devil quails before her. -- *
   Sir, tell me, what is he afraid of ? ' -- The devil does not know what
   is in the soul except what he can recognise by its outward form.
   Supposing her brimfull of light then divine light comes surging out of
   her and when the fiend sees this he is afraid and durst not test her
   with a notion, so the soul stays undisturbed. Which is to her credit
   though unbeknownst to her. -- The third progress is spiritual. When
   such a soul is flooded with the influx of God's spirit, love reinforces
   love, light light, giving a love which fires the soul and which she
   cannot fail to be aware of. The first growth is conscious, the third
   also is conscious and the middle one unconscious.

   28. Plato says, The soul of all creatures is the Godhead.' Then our
   Lord Jesus Christ is the soul of the elect.

   24. The question is, what is the effect on man of the body of our Lord
   Jesus Christ ? I say that its effect on nian is to clarify his nature
   and prevent him committing mortal sin. On the en- lightened it confers
   another boon, receptivity to the divine light and then though they die
   they will have nothing between.

   27. Pray Sir, one to whom eternal light is given, suppose he were to
   die, would he have aught between ? ' -- Once having had eternal light
   he never has anything between.

   28. Tell me, good Sir, what is divine light ? ' -- ^With divine

   light the natural life is no obstacle to the eternal light, or in other
   words, there is no consenting to sin. When we are unable to act up to
   our lights that is a sign that we have not received eternal light.
   Knowledge with the power to apply it, that is eternal light. He who
   receives eternal light takes everything the same.

   29. But even good people are now and then perturbed : have they then no
   light ? '--When our Lord Jesus Christ was drawing near his passion, his
   agony of suffering pierced his soul and called forth the rebuke to
   Judas at the table and St Peter on the mount, to whom he said, Couldst
   thou not watch with me a while ? Thou who didst promise to be with me
   unto death.' But he did not on this account lose the light of unity.
   Once more har- monious with his Father's will he was filled with joy at
   having in accord therewith submitted willingly to pain. The fact of
   being moved involves no loss of light : anything conceived in time is
   moved in time. While we are in time we are affected by time. But the
   more imperturbable one is the more one is established in eternity. By
   their deeds ye shall know them.

   30. He alone can do God's will who resigns his own. Wc are strong in
   proportion as we are inspired with divine power to withstand the things
   that come between ourselves and God. When we stand in our primitive
   innocence, then at last we begin to live.

   31. But when is a man in a state of primitive innocence ? ' --
   Primitive innocence is not attained without divine light. Simple,
   primitive innocence reigns when the pattern of all virtues is present
   in a man and he stands without impediment of nature in the eternal
   truth. It is only by treading upon creature thift we reach the bottom
   rung of Godhood. -- What is the bottom rung of Godhood ? ' -- It is
   spiritualised nature.

   32. Sir, is it better having and giving or not having and letting ? '
   -- Letting is better than giving. Giving adds more lustre, letting
   shows more spirituality. We shed our blood ; the saints let their blood
   be shed.

   33. Will you tell me. Sir, what causes the decay of tenderness ? ' --
   ^What is the tenderness you mean ? -- I mean interior tenderness.' --
   ^To have it is a sign of immaturity ; to lose it betokens ado-
   lescence. The father pets his child when the child is young but as it
   gets to know its father's will he grows seemingly less fond and this
   less obvious fondness is an indication of the child's approach to man's
   estate. With the soul it is the same. Ilis tenderness to her proclaims
   her immature, but as she grows in knowledge and constant harmony with
   the will of God he inspires her with less irrational fondness and this
   is a sign she is developing.

   85. That alone is perfect which does not seek for aught outside

   itself. -- Whatever we can say about perfection to that we can attain.
   -- A gentle man is one whose serenity no trouble can dis- turb. -- ^We
   stand before God while we do not cross the will of God.

   36. When does God work in man unhindered ? -- God finds no hindrance in
   a man who takes both good and ill from God with the same thankfulness.

   87. Sure proof of true humility is the fearful joy of being praised.
   For on coming into touch with truth and finding in himself a witness of
   it, a man is sensible of pleasure but fears it as a likely cause of his
   undoing.

   88. The right loyal heart receives with bitterness inventions of the
   soul which are not sent by God. -- That heart is kind whose
   graciousness is proof against every good and ill.

   89. The treasure of God is loss of possessions, people's despisery,
   sickness and submission to God.

   41. Our Lord Jesus Christ waxed not at all in eternal light ; but the
   things he taught, in beholding these he took peculiar pleasure.

   42. Pious folk should imitate the deified man, Christ. By imitating
   Christ I mean becoming Godlike. What I mean by Grodlike is, your words,
   deeds, conduct, being free from human wont. By human I mean imperfect.
   In proportion to his im- perfection a man is moveable by aught or
   anybody can be (moved) by him. -- What do you mean by moveable ? ' --
   By moveable I mean not impatience only : moveable I call anything
   affected by either good or ill and that can in anywise be anything to
   anyone or to whom anyone can as such be anything, and I call immoveable
   only- that which nothing can affect and which affects nothing. That man
   then I call immoveable to whom good and ill are just the same ; who is
   as far as possible exempt from the agitations of both joy and sorrow.
   It will never be natural to him that his emotions stir not
   independently of mind. But once the mind takes charge, it is all over
   and as it was before and then the man is not a mortal man, he is man
   deified.

   48. Good people have three sorts of expert knowledge. In the first
   place the intelligence is sharpened so that it estimates correctly the
   smallest thing presented to it : its more or less amount of sensible
   admixture they gauge to a nicety and can act accord- ingly. -- In the
   second place, when they have to do a thing they can always tell whether
   it proceeds from the ground of God or the ground of nature. Thirdly, so
   subtile is their understanding that any ghostly form, the very faintest
   light, which appears to them, they recognise for fiend or spirit.

   44. The true test of interior perfection is that nothing thou doest
   from without casts any shadow within.

   45. When the Godhead began to inquire how mankind could be restored to
   its original perfection, the Father sat in counsel in the chamber of
   the Holy Trinity. The Father said, Who shall we send to save mankind ?
   ' Answered him the Son and said, Father, send me : I will save
   mankind.' Then stooped him down the eternal Word of the heavenly
   Father, that is to say, his Son, who is the middle Person of the Holy
   Trinity, and clad himself in human nature. Remaining what he was he
   took upon him that which he was not and was thus obedient to his Father
   in heaven and not in heaven only but on earth as well. Obedience to his
   Father and love towards mankind constrained him to perfect all his
   Father's work.

   46. Sir, for God's sake, may I ask you something that I want to know,
   something very subtle ? ' -- By all means. Whatever it may be and
   however subtle, I will try and answer. Ask me what you will. -- Well,
   what I want to know is this : was our Lord Jesus Christ hindered in any
   way by doing outward works ? ' -- I can give you a definite answer to
   that. The soul of Christ was never an independent entity as such. It no
   sooner was than it was Christ ; directly it was made, straightway it
   was united ; first one and then the other it is true but yet both
   timeless. At his first appearance Christ was snatched from independence
   into the keeping of the middle Person of the Trinity where in essential
   wisdom he gazes without blenching at the naked fullness of the divine
   perfection. From the moment when Christ's soul and body were united
   with the Godhead his soul has been gazing at the Godhead as it is doing
   to this day. As to the lower powers of his soul which function in the
   body making possible his preaphing and his teaching and the other
   things he did, there the joy of contemplation was diminished somewhat :
   not the vision but the pleasure of the sight. But the higher powers of
   his soul, wherein he was united, these remained always in unveiled
   contemplation. Now I have explained how Christ was hindered and at the
   same time not. One thing more and let that suffice as giving you the
   key to the whole matter. The hindrance was physical not psychic. But
   even so he never failed in the minutest point to fulfil the mission on
   which his Father sent him, preaching and teaching and doing outward
   works whereby he earned reward and honour.

   47. Could Christ earn reward ? ' -- There are two rewards ; one of them
   Christ earned, the other not. One of the rewards we earn by our good
   works is the vision of the Godhead. This reward Christ did not earn
   since from the moment Christ's body was united with the Godhead, his
   soul has been gazing at the Godhead, as it is doing to this day. The
   other reward we earn by our good

   works is the glorification of the body with the soul after the day of
   judgment and this reward Christ earned by his holy life, his body being
   glorified together with his soul at his resurrection. Now thou knowest
   how Christ did earn' reward and also not.

   48. Just one other thing.' -- Tell me, what is that ? -- You say that
   Christ gained honour. What honour did he gain ? ' -- Christ has the
   title of The Head of Holy Christendom and this honour Christ has won by
   his holy life.

   49. A man to whom eternal light is given, is he prone to sin in time ?
   ' -- One to whom eternal light is given may well stoop to imperfection
   and sometimes falls an easier prey to frivolity and suctilike venial
   sins than another man. -- What is the cause of this propensity ? ' --
   It comes from being engrossed in one simple thing ; multitudinous
   images disturb the soul, tossing her about with their various conceits.
   Once conceiving unity she is dis- tracted by diversity. But as soon as
   she begins to sec, it is as though it had never been and she can free
   herself completely without the slightest effort ; which is a sign that
   she has eternal light. To see and be unable to escape would argue lack
   of eternal light. You know now how it is that people, even with eternal
   light, are prone to sin. St Paul sinned after he had been caught up.

   50. The first and noblest work of God is motionlessness : divine rest.
   It stands to reason that the maker of the motionless is him- self
   unmoved. Were God not immoveable there could nothing motionless be
   made.

   Aristotle says all moving things proceed from rest and from necessity
   and moving things arc all seeking rest. Man likewise then "^ought to be
   as motionless as possible. -- When is a man motionless ? ' -- The soul
   is motionless when nothing whatever can perturb her ; when she is
   neither glad nor sad and cannot be gladdened nor yet saddened. And she
   must be unnecessitous. -- When is she unnecessitous ? ' -- The soul is
   unnecessitous when she has no need to cleave to any creature and not
   only has no need, it is hell-pain to her to dwell upon the form of
   creature since there is no rest for her save in the formless form of
   God. She is un- necessitous when she has come into her rights and, with
   no need of change, rests in the unnecessitous nothingness of his
   unchanging nature.

   51. Sir, what did St Paul mean by saying, We shall be one spirit with
   God ? " When is the soul one spirit with God ? ' -- She is one spirit
   with God when she has no image or anything between. And she is turned
   to spirit when she is not subject to any creature love or appetite.

   52. Sir, what is perfect love ? ' -- Perfect love leaves nothing

   less than God. -- Pray tell me what you mean.' -- I mean, having hold
   of nothing but God they cannot leave go of less than God, who are as
   they should be. Natural ties have been cut.

   53. Tell me, Sir, for the love of God, is it possible to pray or ask of
   God quite unselfishly ? ' -- Oh yes. I will tell you how. There are two
   cases of unselfish prayer. The first is on our own account, that we may
   be rid of some imperfection which comes between us and eternal truth.
   The second case is prayer for some other person's sin, knowing all the
   facts and that he desires to be free. For these things we may pray and
   with avidity. But our human will must confine itself to the will of
   God, as thus : ' Lord, thou knowest I desire not nor do I will aught
   save what thou dost will : an thou know something better, give me
   that,' so losing thine own and keeping his.

   54. Sir, what about the man they talk of sometimes among pious folk,
   who sets such store by physical austerities and long- winded prayers ;
   is that the best or is there something better ? ' -- The most perfect
   bond that we can have is innocence, a blame- less life, and being
   wholly without guile it is best to drop words altogether for words are
   interlopers between ourselves and God.

   55. What is the sign of union with God's will ? ' -- Perfect
   singlemindedness. -- It is characteristic of the gracious, deified
   mind, from trivial error to extract much wisdom. -- The very least
   thing in excess of absolute necessity will count. -- Christ's every
   action is a pious precept. -- An angel's nature is his intellect and
   his intellect is his impartible nature.

   56. He to whom light is given grows conscious of the darkness in all
   creatures.

   57. Will you tell me, Sir, why Solomon should say. The righteous man
   falls seven times a day ? What is this falling of the righteous man ? '
   -- It is the lapsing of his soul from the highest level she can reach
   to : failure to remain at the very summit where she tran- scends
   creature in God, that is the fall of the perfect man.

   58. When does one person love another in God without ad- mixture of
   nature ? ' -- The sure test of pure divine love is the sense of nothing
   but God, always with enlightenment.

   59. Why is it that a man will ask for things he does not need and
   knowing this to be the case will still go on doing it : what does he do
   it for ? ' -- It is nature. When appetites are uncon- trolled a man
   will ask for the impossible. -- But supposing it is not impossible nor
   yet unlikely and he is self-controlled, what is it then ? ' -- I tell
   you it is nature. -- Yes, yes, good Sir, but leave out nature I ' --
   That will I not. It is nature inasmuch as it is mingled with divine
   nature.

   60. What is an angel ? ' -- Angel like soul is a perpetual nature.

   The soul has no parts, this and that. Wherever she turns she turns as a
   whole.

   61. What is essential virtue ? ' -- In essential virtue man is in a
   state of having no active heart's desire ; he knows what is right and
   is able to live up to his lights in the power of his primitive
   nobility.

   62. What is the sign of eternal life ? ' -- Absence of hate is a sign
   of eternal light. So far as we fail in love towards all mankind, we
   never really have it.

   63. Pray Sir, when are we discriminating ? ' -- When we know one thing
   from another. -- And when are we above discrimination ? ' -- When we
   know all in all then we transcend discrimination.

   64. What does St Paul mean when he speaks of " redeeming the time
   because the days are evil " ? ' -- He calls the days evil referring to
   the changeableness of time. He says, redeeming the time --

   When is time redeemed ? ' -- Let me tell you. To do a good work is not
   to redeem time but to pawn it. It is a good work to rest from sin and
   exercise some virtue. To do better work is not redeeming time. He who
   perfects by practice does better. To do the best of all, that does
   redeem the time. It is best of all to rest in the embrace of God. --
   But is that redeeming the time ? ' -- To be sure it is. Time is not
   redeemed in time. The redemption of time is the timeless spirit's
   atonement above time.

   65. Will you expound that sentence in St John's epistle, " Blessed are
   the dead that die in God ? " When do we die in God ? ' -- When
   everything is dead that intervenes between ourselves and God. -- Well
   then, will you tell me what is the joy of spirits in eternity : arc
   they always finding something new in God ? ' -- Verily Psay, if they
   did not find it ever new there would be an end to eternity. Were there
   aught in Gk)d exhaustible by creature, eternity would end and heaven
   cease to be.

   66. Sir, what is true wisdom ? ' -- True wisdom, so says one
   philosopher, means the knowledge of all created things and the creator
   who has made them.

   67. According to St Paul, the closest bond of love a man can have is
   harmony of will. Our Lord in his love made eternal provision for all
   human suffering when his Son died upon the cross.

   68. He follows hardest on the heels of God who leaves all temporal
   things behind and clings to the eternal.

   69. Joy is the reward of virtue, says one of the saints. -- Tell me,
   when does a man do his duty by creatures ? ' -- ^When he knows them and
   leaves tjiiem.

   70. A saint says. So long as we will and will not our free will is not
   captive to God. If any man does as he should God will do what that man
   would.

   71, Sir, how would you define grace ? * -- I define grace as him whom
   no joy nor pleasure can gladden, no pain nor adversity sadden.

   72. The most successful prayers are the willing learners from creature
   or the spoken word.

   78 . When does God work in man unhindered ? ' -- When he takes good and
   ill from God with the same thankfulness. -- But, with one and the same
   thankfulness or each with thankfulness ? ' -- ^They must be received
   with the same thankfulness. Time is always true to its own nature but
   were soul and body displaced into eternity motion would be lost. The
   less moveable thou art the more thou art established in eternity.

   74. Sir, when is virtue present in a man ? ' -- There is virtue in the
   soul just as memory and knowledge and love are in the soul, for they
   are spiritual in their substance. There is virtue in the soul and it is
   present in a man as long as it is not cast out in lawless utterances.

   75. Will you tell me. Sir, why we are sometimes quite unmoved

   in suffering whereas at other limes we hail it with delight and then
   again it readily affects us ? ' -- Supposing a man is by himself with
   his senses indrawn from the multiplicity of things and recollected to
   himself, then his soul will be unmoved inasmuch as God is present in
   her. But if his senses are broadcast upon things and more or less
   unstable on those things, he will be readily affected. Then let him
   beware of lawless utterance ; he must recollect him- self and in deep
   humility just appeal lovingly to God : Lord thou knowest I can do
   naught without thee,' and quick as thought thou art back in God. ^

   76. Pray Sir, is one quite detached w^hen one gives no consent to sin
   and bitter as it was to part from things it were just as bitter to
   return to them ? ' -- Yes, surely.

   77. Is eternal light vouchsafed to anyone who falls short ? '-r- Oh yes
   ! It was to St Paul.

   78. Is no holy soul beatified that has shortcomings ? ' -- Yes,
   thousands if one reckoned them. -- But no saint can be sanctified
   unless he has received eternal light ? ' -- Yes, numbers.

   79. What do you mean, Sir, when you talk of divine light and eternal
   light, are they the same or is there a difference ? Do they consist in
   the same thing ? -- They are not the same. By one light we know, by
   another we can and by a third one we do. Now to distinguish between
   them. To perceive divine truth and answer thereto, that I call divine
   light. I say it is God's light because it is Godlike. It is not God
   himself ; it may be given by an angel or a saint. Eternal light, again,
   I define to be the perfect image of the impartible nature of God and of
   it St Paul says, the

   third heaven and its light are not immediately present to us here in
   this body ; we have to return to our true selves. Ah, woe is me, how
   wearisome my exile 1 It is impartible light when the soul departing
   from the body flies straight back to God into whose light she is
   absorbed. Beyond this her perception does not go. And I mean by
   impartible light the vision of God with nothing between : no creaturely
   hindrance, no time, no looking back : in eternity. -- St John had
   eternal light ; he knew the whole truth and attained to it. All things
   were possible to him, but though not guilty of any mortal sin he was
   still liable to its suggestion. That no man can escape.

   80. What is the sign of eternal light ? ' -- It is a sure sign when
   everything not God is irksome and virtue has become a second nature.

   81. Talkativeness or over-attention to our daily wants is fatal to
   friendly intercourse with God. If wc would escape the purgatorial fires
   we must set a watch on all our ways, especially our words. Different is
   the cleansing fire of the perfeetion of God and the love of the soul,
   between them imperfections are consumed away.

   82. Good people's food is clear consciousness and intercourse with holy
   souls and constant reception of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Neither the devil nor yet any creature ever gave an appetite for the
   body of our Lord Jesus Christ ; this comes from God alone, you may be
   sure.

   84. Tell me. Sir, do we find in holy writ mention of any rapture
   besides that of St Paul ? ' -- No. -- But they tell me three are to he
   found ; Adam was caught up while he was asleep and St John when he was
   resting on the bosom of our Lord and St Paul when he was felled to
   earth ; they each saw God without means, without any image or
   likeness.' -- Verily, I say, before the death of our Lord Jesus Christ
   no man had ever seen God in his God-nature except that golden temple
   our Lady Mary at the moment when our Lady conceived divine and human
   nature ; then she received eternal light and saw God in his simple
   nature, but before that no creature. -- Then what was Adam's rapture
   and St John's ? ' -- When God created Adam his body was made painless
   like his soul. You could have hewn him in his sleep and it would not
   have hurt him for the lower powers of his soul were obedient to her
   higher ones and she was subject to the law of her perfect nature and
   unhindered by gross body and this was his by right of nature. Had he
   stayed at the summit of his soul he would have kept her in her maker.
   "He knew God had created him and that divine nature "was destined to
   unite with human nature and he had dis- criminate knowledge of all
   creatures, each in its natural perfection just as God had made them and
   he was carried away by enjoyment

   of the sight. You must know that he was sleeping like any other man. --
   * Then what was the rapture of St John ? * -- ^He was resting. Rest so
   called from its likeness to the abstraction of our Lord Jesus Christ
   and St John's from its likeness to them both ; a gentle sinking into
   dispassion, that is what his rapture was.

   85. Is a man liable to fall once he has had eternal light ? ' -- I say,
   No. If Adam had seen God he would not have fallen and the archangel
   Lucifer, if he had seen God in his impartible essence would not have
   fallen. -- I have heard tell that in ecstasy there is no interference
   with free will. Is that really so ? ' -- It neither strengthens nor
   weakens the free will. Verily I say, anyone who holds that a man can
   fall after eternal light, though he commit no greater sin than St Agnes
   did, shall die infiillibly for it is lieresy and mortal sin to have
   this belief. That soul can no more fall than St Peter could. The
   heavenly Father might as well forsake his Son as the soul wherein he
   has given his Son birth. If the Father ends the Son ends ; if the Son
   ends eternity ends ; if eternity ends the soul ends.

   86. Sir, when you speak of God's birth, of the Father begetting his Son
   in the soul, is this birth the same as the rapture of St Paul and what
   happened at Pentecost to the disciples or are these different things ?
   ' -- They are exa(tly the same. -- Then when you talk of eternal light
   do you mean God's birth in the soul or is that something else ? ' -- I
   mean the same thing ; they are identical. But one thing I do say. Birth
   is the better term and nearer to the truth though in reality there is
   no difference. I will tell you why. An angel by nature is eternal light
   ; the sun is eternal light ; the stars are eternal light. Eternal light
   is ascribed to things that are not changed by time ; and since we can
   attribute eternal light to creatures so we may to man in an imperfect
   sense. But birth applies to the heavenly Father alone, this birth in
   eternity. God catches the soul all at once to himself and his birth is
   gottetl therein. There it is to him well-nigh the same as the Son in
   the Trinity. I say, well-nigh, for it is there by grace and the Son by
   nature. -- Suppose a man has eternal light, is he prone to temporal sin
   ? ' -- It was after Pentecost that Peter sinned.

   90. Can a man make certain of having nothing more to over- come ? ' --
   St Paul had things to overcome after he was caught up. And our Lord
   Jesus Christ had to overcome. Though his soul and body were united with
   the Godhead and the Godhead is impassible, yet his future pains were
   present with him, racking all his soul-powers.

   91. When the soul prepares for God by chasing away thoughts and
   discarding all the things she has relied on and endeavours to get rid
   of every means but without success, tell me. Sir, what

   MEISTER ECKHART

   ought she to do next ? ' -- When the images from outside are all gone
   let her abase herself and lovingly entreat of him somewhat that she
   still lacks. -- But if she refuses to desire or entreat, being minded
   to remain quite simple ? * -- Then let her simply fix her mind on God
   with vehement longing. -- But surely, Sir, longing is a means and she
   wants to be quite simple and direct : without any images and free from
   this and that, with not a word or prayer to come between ? ' -- I
   say^it is impossible in the unglorified body ; she ought not to expect
   it. -- If that is the case, Sir, then it seems to me her watchword
   ought to be refusal -- of objective things and subjective images -- and
   that is her best way.' -- There is no doubt of it ; she can do no more.
   When a soul like this is rapt above herself int6 naked knowledge of
   naught it is God who does it at his own good pleasure, absolutely
   freely, without any help of hers.

   92. Sir, can we realize all our minds can grasp ? ' -- No. I can
   conceive of things I cannot be : the unglorified body is not so agile
   as the mind.

   93. What is a reasonable man ? ' -- One who is controlled in joy and
   sorrow, him I call a reasonable man. -- How would you define prayer ? '
   -- St Augustine says, prayer is the soul's detach- ment from things and
   attachment to God. -- Tell me. Sir, can we be rid of things at once
   without any trouble ? ' -- No, it is always accompanied with pain :
   that indicates the pull of something higher. If it comes without pain
   it is no matter for rejoicing. True, St Paul lost things all at once,
   but afterwards he had to conquer them in detail. Conquests made by
   suffering are lasting.

   94. What God has by nature in unity is not denied to any rational
   ^creature, by grace, in his individuality. Rejoicing and sorrowing,
   that is nature. We must expect nature in people.

   95. Sir, are we punished for faults ? ' -- We are punished for sins and
   hindered by faults. -- But you said that when a man has eternal light
   he never has anything between and now you say he is prone to sin. Do
   such people sin and is sin punished w4th fire ? You certainly did say
   that they have nothing between. How are these two facts to be
   reconciled ? How is the sin wiped out ? ' -- ^By the perfect love of
   the creator to his creature and the creature to his creator : the sin
   lies between them and in the fire of their love sin burns away.

   96. Those to whom eternal light has come, do they afterwards remain in
   a state of love and vision ? I am wondering, being established in the
   one, where there is naught but one, how they manage to be one and
   other, for there is that in me, when spirit conceives unity, that
   passes all distinction. Arc grace and vision and light all the same ? '
   -- No, not by any means. Take an illustration. The stars are put out by
   the sun and in the same way

   grace and vision fade when eternal light is given. The highest of the
   angels draws a form from God and on assuming it, adapts it further to
   himself and informs therewith the middle ones who pass it on to those
   below and the lowest give it to the soul and the fiend can copy it. So
   they may be deceived. But the soul in whom the heavenly Father speaks
   his Word does not receive from the lower angels : what the highest of
   the angels draws from God he pours into this soul without the
   intervention of the rest. Verily I say, seldom or never do people get
   through angels apparitions of such things as are given in time and
   temporalities.

   97. What is the difference between nature and spirit ? ' -- I call that
   spirit whereby we are aware what we ought to have and what to leave
   whether we would or no. Spirit makes us do it, willy-nilly. Not to do
   it because we do not want to would be nature.

   98. When is nature uppermost ? ' -- When we have at heart something we
   ought to get rid of and will not.

   99. How would you distinguish, Sir, between sin, fault and infirmity ?
   ' -- It is sin to cleave with desire to anything that does not make for
   God. By a fault I mean any accidental falling short of God. And
   infirmity may be defined as not having the mind fixed on God all the
   time.

   100. O thou fathomless Truth,' cries St Paul, thy ways are past finding
   out ! ' When he cries O, he is thinking of the hidden hoard of the
   divine nature. -- What hoard ? ' -- The wisdom of God. Angels' and
   souls' desire is appeased by nothing but the best. The wisdom of God is
   savoured when all creatures point (us) towards the best. The other
   hoard is God's art. Art amounts, in^temporal things, to singling out
   the best. True art loses this altogether and abides in the ground of
   them all. St Paul was caught up above this wonder and above this O and
   saw the very thing he is seeing to this day, the bond of life meanwhile
   persisting in his body as form does in its matter. His higher self
   received naked eternal light ; body was no hindrance, soul received
   from God.

   101. When is the soul above O ? ' -- When she gets the simple
   impression of divine form, of the image which is the Son himself for so
   the Father is always letting down the apex of the higher world into the
   one below. -- Anyone on earth may be deceived excepting him in whom the
   Father bears his Son.

   102. What is the sign of the eternal birth ? ' -- While a man is
   subject to sensible affection he has no conception of eternal truth.
   When he does conceive the eternal truth no creature can comfort or
   discomfit him. The time when Paul was felled to earth he heard a voice
   which said to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me ? ' He said, Who
   art thou Lord ? ' -- " I am Jesus of Nazareth.'

   The voice was not God : God was speaking through an angel. God can no
   more lose his nature than utter his eternal Word in sound or image. God
   said through an angel, I am Jesus of Nazareth. He said /, referring to
   the impartible I of divine nature. The shows distinction between the
   Father and the Son. Jesus of Nazareth suggests the union of divine and
   human nature.

   108. St James says, With the Father of lights is no turning.' There arc
   three kinds of turning. One of nature, another of will and a third of
   power. I speak of the first. Turning means changing from one thing to
   another, becoming more or less, going to and fro. One philosopher says,
   Things are all fighting their way back to naught.' If God withdrew
   support things would all relapse into primeval chaos. The philosopher
   says, all created things are fluent. That is fluent which is not
   stationary in itself. If creature could touch bottom heaven would end
   and creature would be God. Natural change there is none with the Father
   of lights. Change is due to a longing for rest. If there were rest in
   him divine nature would pass away and heaven be at an end. He does not
   alter. What he has like nature is generation. If generation stopped
   things would all go back to their primeval nothingness. But of what
   avail are long discussions of God's nature if we are not aware of his
   image in us ?

   104. Pray Sir, what makes the soul unchangeable ? ' -- Stability of
   soul depends upon three things. First on her having her body well-
   controlled : what the soul wills, that her body must do without
   question. If Adam had preserved his natural perfection he could have
   done whatever he desired and creatures would all have beein obedient to
   him. But when he fell both his own body and all creatures left off
   obeying him : they were no longer true to him who was untrue to God. --
   ^The second thing is to have no attachment to or enjoyment in anything
   inferior to God. -- Thirdly, no quarter must be given to the mortal
   nature. If Adam had stood firm he would not have become mortal. Adam as
   God made him on the first day would have survived until the day of
   judgment. St Paul declares, From the moment God called me not once have
   I looked back.' If Adam had seen God in him- self he could not have
   fallen. He knew that God had made him and what he made -hini^for and
   this he viewed with carnal pleasure. It was this and nothing else that
   carried him away.

   105. When our Lord Jesus Christ was about to depart to heaven to his
   Father his disciples were with him at the place of his ascen- sion,
   distraught and unable to speak or pay attention, so much were they
   engrossed with the bodily presence of our Lord. And while they stood
   staring up at the sky there came an angel saying,

   Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye here gazing up into heaven ? '

   Why so absorbed in that which, after all, cannot remain with you for
   ever ? Philosophers tell us that creature does not stay, it is flowing
   all the time back into its source. If the disciples had been proof to
   sweetness not one of them would have been distraught. For this the
   angel chid them saying, Why stand ye here ? ' as though to say, why
   occupy your minds so much with the beloved bodily form of our Lord
   Jesus Christ ? Ye only waste yourselves on temporal things which, after
   all, are impermanent. Why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? ' God is the
   form of the soul, the soul's soul. When spirit is caught up above all
   images, into the eternal truth, then the soul stops and sees into
   heaven. It is man's highest happiness that she cannot rest until, being
   rid of images, she is reflected back into the naught where she has been
   eternally without herself. Soul becomes Son when she is thus
   transported over all into the open where God is ; then soul draws out
   of God and when she is as we have said she is standing at the door. She
   loses her own nature drinking out of God, on the threshold of gnosis,
   where nothing enters into her except the eternal. Eternal rest, then,
   is not given her except by him.

   106. Aristotle says, everything partial is painful ; the most united is
   most painful when divided.

   107. Three kinds of people receive God. The first receive him for
   pleasure. God is sweet to them in anticipation so they enter- tain him
   selfishly and to their cost, with little genuine profit. The second
   receive him of necessity, in discarding sins, for without God they have
   no power to do it. The third lose desire and desiring naught receive
   him wisely and with real benefit. The benefit is this ; they recognise
   each fault with rue and in true penitence contrive that he shall find
   in us the reflection of what we seek in him ; thus getting him to dwell
   in us as we do in him we attain to angelic life : the upward flight,
   the simple glance into God's nature, and at each ending of the act the
   steady reflection of God so that in multitudinous things like bodily
   necessity, she is not debarred from the eternal but in multiplicity is
   still united.

   108. Pray Sir, is it possible for mere creature to partake of God's
   nature ? ' -- No, for as St Augustine argues, God is remote from matter
   and that which has no matter has no parts and is indivisible. Creature
   can receive no part of God's nature because God is impartible by
   nature. -- I do not mean part. Sir, in the sense of fragment ; I mean
   part in the sense of community of spirit with spirit in divine nature.
   That was my idea in asking.' -- You must make allowance for the
   difference in creatures. One is united, another separated. See how one
   is united. The will of the Father and the obedience of the Son seized,
   with the power of their common Spirit, in the bare chamber of the
   virgin heart of

   their chosen vessel Mary, her most pure blood-stream and there- from,
   with all his members, wrought one faultless man and poured therein a
   soul complete with powers and this by the power of the Godhead. When,
   out of chaos (having brooded there for aye) a shining spiritual soul
   emerged, straightway all imperfection was removed and by the Spirit
   itself this soul was admitted to the rank of spirit and, sponsored by
   the soul, the body was received as well. Such is the mode of union of
   united creatures. -- And how do separated creatures participate God's
   nature ? ' -- St Peter says that creatures according to their natures
   partake of God in three ways ; as being, as life and as grace. As
   being, creatures all without exception. As life, receptive creatures,
   from angels and men downwards. Mark how the Father by his generative
   power created by the propagation of his Word. From his interior Word
   burst forth their common mind, by nature the one angel of all
   creatures. Him he commanded to pour his mobile power into the sun and
   from the solar energy there showered upon earth, increased and
   multiplied, trees, beasts and all mankind. As regards the soul, the
   heavenly Father draws up with his power the lower powers of the soul ;
   the Son lights up the middle ones and the Holy Ghost impinging on the
   sharpness of her mind, flashes it back to the absolute zero of the
   Tri-unity. I say to zero ; to the boundary line between united and
   separated creatures. Christ namely, as he was in his first light,
   bereft of personality which the middle Person of the Trinity preserves
   therein, where in essential wisdom he is transfixed, confused with
   God's all- perfection. Further, the soul gets light from God's
   essential revelation. This is her aught and his causeless
   incomprehensibility. There her aught abides, graven in a point, mounted
   in the splendour of his eternal love-nature. In this sense mere
   creature receives and partakes of the divine nature.

   109. When do we lose God altogether ? ' -- How do you mean, lose ? What
   is your idea in asking this ? -- I mean lose in the sense of knowing
   God one without other : free from matter and form and exempt from
   creatures, which are matter and form, one and other. So that creature
   conveys to her not one whit of God for all they say that God is in all
   creatures. How is this loss to be accounted for ? ' -- I answer : Three
   sorts of people are deprived of God. One in material creatures, another
   in spiritual substances, the third above creature and below God. In the
   first case there is loss in creatures of gross material nature. This
   happens when, her senses being sated with their objective forms, she
   escapes from their separateness to their perfect whole. Thus she loses
   the dense part of their nature and there remains to her only the
   sweetness of their innate nobility. In the second case, since no

   caused thing is superior to its cause and the aforesaid sweetness is
   derived from creatures whereas the soul proceeds from God, like though
   not of his same nature, therefore the soul being sated, not stinted,
   with this sweetness will acquire a fresh thirst, for ineffable
   sweetness, a longing for her first felicity. This finally detaches her
   from material nature and drives her to pure knowledge of herself and
   spiritual substances in general. Now she seeks delight in the
   enjoyments of her kind but finds it not for creatures are all dry and
   like no better than its like : abiding actuality is the only thing to
   quench her parching thirst. -- In the third case she loses her
   activity. It happens thus. All spiritual substances act instantaneously
   though not at any instant of time. Losing instantaneously her
   materiality she loses each and every use of her separated nature. The
   thirst is followed by the loss of all variable activities and approach
   to the outskirts of eternity. Here she awaits the love-light wherein
   she secs the Trinity. This waiting is personified in Mary, Mary
   standing without at the sepulchre, waiting in her outward helplessness
   the embrace of the eternal nature. She saw two angels one at the feet
   and another at the head. Sight is light-perception. The angel at the
   head stands for the omnipotence of the majesty of God ; the one at the
   feet, for his subtile nature. They asked her, Whom dost thou seek ? '
   For the incomprehensibility of God and her passionate desire- nature
   would form no satisfying union. Tlie question is one of incapacity for
   his incomprehensible nature ; she wants to embrace the whole extent of
   him and is not able to. She said, Jesus of Nazareth ! ' He is the
   keeper in this solitude. Turning, she sees him standing in the likeness
   of a gardener : in the in-graven nature of the Person imaged in the
   ground of unity. He questionfid her,

   Whom seckest thou ? ' This is the blinding transcendental light, the
   glory in the midst of the Trinity, which eclipses her own dim
   understanding and the aforesaid light. If thou hast borne him hence,
   tell me, ' she says. She has lost her wits in the overwhelming light of
   the immediate truth. He says, Mary ! ' using her own name. When the
   Father, departing from his essential personality, begets out of himself
   in otherness of Person his Word, the perfect reproduction of himself,
   he grasps with his paternal hand his impartible, beatific nature and
   harking back in spirit to himself is with himself as Son well-nigh in
   otherness. This is her name of whose child David cries, Thou art my Son
   this day have I begotten thee.' She would have touched him. Now behold
   and marvel at her love of God ! Not satisfied with rising beyond all
   creaturely conception she desires to sink into the undifferentiated
   oneness of the essence of the Three, of Gk)d with God, nature with
   nature, ftnd lose the creature-nature that is hers e'en though that
   would

   not be for her own highest happiness. For in oneness she would lose her
   knowledge, her love and her enjoyment, in other words, the actual goal
   of creatures. Hence his warning, Touch me not ! ' for this touching
   means the refunding into God of separated natures, whereas it is to
   creatures full of love and feeling that the consciousness of unbroken
   oneness brings supreme felicity. If she runs into God or God runs into
   her, either way hers is the loss because of the immensity of his
   essential nature and the insignificance of her creaturchood. As a
   dewdrop to the ocean are all creatures as compared with their creator.
   He bids her Go to Galilee to my disciples and tell them of my
   resurrection ; there they shall see me as I said.' Truly a bitter blow
   ! She, who was not satisfied with God in the likeness of the second
   Person, who wanted to merge into his oneness, and Jesus bids her go to
   Galilee to bring word of his presence to mere creatures : her, who was
   impatient of the universal Word in eternal unity ! She obeys him and
   goes thither. To Galilee, submissive to Jesus. Galilee means crossing
   (or transition). There is no temporal life but has to yield to physical
   necessity. Her watchword then must be, I no longer live but Christ
   liveth in me.' She came to Jesus' brethren who are three. Uninterrupted
   union ; perfect corre- spondence with the mirror of eternity, without
   any discrepancy whatever ; complete submission of the soul -powers and
   loss of all activity in the actual power of God in the essential nature
   of the body and the soul. Lo, she loses God in the limiting value of
   creature.

   110. Love God with all thy soul. -- What do you mean by loving God with
   all one's soul ? ' -- Ascending naked to God with nothing between, that
   I call whole-souled love. The soul's life is love, the soul's love is
   gnosis and her gnosis is her being. The soul's real being is delight.
   The soul is never so near to God but God stands one side soul the
   other. Being belies not itself. Augustine says, God is the soul's soul
   and being.

   114. Pray Sir, can one be moved without sinning?' -- ^When the animal
   passions are stirred the movement comes from with- out, not from
   within. Like a tree blown about by the wind and not torn up from the
   ground because the roots hold. In a case of agitation allowance must be
   made both for the person and the cause.

   115. Can one remain the same in good and ill ? ' -- Your bodily nature
   must always be the sport of joy and sorrow ; that it can never lose.
   But will remains the same in fortune and misfortune, without resentment
   in the depths of woe. The power of impatience is taken from the
   recipient of eternal light.

   116. How do you megn Sir^ the power ? Pray explain.' -- I

   am using power here with reference to two things. On the one hand there
   is loss of the power of resentment. And on the other hand the power to
   be upset is removed from those who are vouch- safed eternal light. To
   lose their equanimity would be to them hell-torment and impossible.
   Joys and sorrows are not grown in the ground of eternal truth ; none of
   creatures' nurslings are truth's seedlings and that is the key to this
   matter of dispassion.

   117. There is another thing that needs explanation. You say that power
   is withdrawn and they are not able for it. Is this inability of nature
   or of grace ? ' -- Nature acts differently. Were it a natural
   disability then effort would be vain, which it is not. It is an
   inability of grace ; the soul is caught in the blaze of divine light
   and held by the majesty of God in the reflection of the essential good
   of the third Person. There personal distinction disappears merged in
   the oneness of the Three. There she is lost to the multiplicity of
   creatures. That answers your inquiries about the loss of power in pious
   souls and how they are impotent to lose their equanimity. Now, at last,
   they are omnipotent.

   118. For the love of God, Sir, expound to me one statement you are fond
   of making.' -- What is that ? -- You say that inability to live up to
   one's lights shows the absence of eternal light. The man who has
   eternal light can put his theories into practice. She only has to see a
   thing and lo, it is as though it had not been and she is free from it,
   which alarms me somewhat for I am never guilty of the most venial fault
   but first it is suggested to my mind and this does not prevent me from
   committing it. Tell me, Sir, what is her essential power ? ' --
   ^Essential power is one. Her essential power is will-and-love and this
   is not a prey to images bodily or ghostly, so she is essentially
   potential and that is what I fnean when I call her really free from
   (passive to) it.

   119. I crave your counsel. Sir : In the throes of intellectual
   conception, at the actual moment of it, I would fain be absolutely
   free.' -- It is impossible ; gross matter forbids. Soul is volatile by
   nature, body is made of dense material. That this dense material should
   be as nimble as the psychic is not to be expected in the unglorified
   body. To the eye colour, to the car sound. There is no harm in that nor
   is it any barrier to eternal truth. We ought to disregard them it is
   true, but that cannot be. Yet one thing I can tell you for your comfort
   : no will or love is lost on these dis- turbers of the peace.
   Furthermore I say, the power to will and love being absent, her power
   is what I call essential power. It is a certain test of essence when
   nothing wrought from without gives any reaction within.

   120. In the image-bearing form of God which impartibly con- tains the
   form of all things there shines the universal form unformed

   in oneness, which radiates one single light into all spirits variously
   : the highest spirits, as becomes their stable nature, without reflec-
   tion and souls in this body according to their fitness in this passing
   time. Mark how this image-bearing light, which the soul receives from
   its reflection, carries her beyond this mode of changing time into
   eternity, to the level of the highest spirits. When a mind habitually
   dwells in its eternal image, God to wit, with more delight than in
   itself, to such a mind the image-bearing light appears in its eternal
   form. Then the mind is transported over these manifold and changing
   things which exist in time and inhabits these rather than itself.
   Remember, we are dealing here with spirit not with essence.

   121. The image-bearing light of divine unity is impartible and yet both
   essence and nature. Now the question is, how is it essence and how is
   it nature ? The answer is as follows. As essence it subsists in
   permanent, immanent stillness. It appears as all things in impartible
   mode ; not in the mode of any creature : it is a mode of its own in
   that same absolute stillness. There the distinctions of the Persons are
   sublimed to this simple modeless mode. Behold it now the essence of the
   Persons and of all things : the essence of the Persons it is by nature
   but of creatures by grace. For consider. It contains the form of all
   things impartibly, as essence. In this form it is ingrained in all
   things. This same impartible form (or image) is also nature and as
   nature it preserves its one-being in the Trinity and the Trinity its
   one-being in the unity. And as this one-being in the Trinity it is the
   impartible potentiality of the Trinity : the nature of the Persons but
   not that of all things. For if it were the nature of all things it
   would reproduce itself in all the things in manifestation in its own
   potential nature. Then things would all be God in the same sense that
   God is God. Now that is not the case. This shows that it is not the
   nature of all things but only the nature of the Persons and there
   exists no thing but has its own appropriate nature.

   122. Since the impartible image-bearing light behaves as essence and
   also as its nature, has it then, I ask, the idiosyncrasies of each or
   not ? -- No, assuredly not. There is no more than one. Its chief
   idiosyncrasy is that it is shining by itself and is manifest only to
   the Persons. But in that this image-bearing light falls upon all things
   and the only thing that shows it is itself, you see it has the
   character of light. This character belongs to essential essence and it
   also belongs to its nature's nature. Here essence and nature are shown
   to be one being with one idiosyncrasy not two idiosyncrasies ; for
   supposing there were two then one idiosyncrasy would cause the other ;
   which is impossible : the essential stillness behaves as simple essence
   and nature's radiant Trinity as well.

   128. Hence arises the question, in the essence and its nature do things
   all appear in impartible fashion or no ? -- The answer is, Yes, they
   appear in the essence in immanent stillness and impartible mode :
   essence and nature one light in light's summit. The essence is light's
   source and centre. As such it is essence. Also in the Trinity nature
   shines with the light of all things in the same impartible way. But
   there is stillness in the depths of essence.

   124. But how nature in the Trinity is one and three proceed

   from one is not to be deduced from the impartibility of the first
   cause. Augustine says, the Persons are one in nature. Hence nature and
   Persons are alike eternal. Intellect is by nature perfectly
   intelligible to itself in the light of nature and its con- ception of
   itself is other than this intellect. Intellect is not begotten ; it is
   the paternal Person who begets the knower in perfectly conceiving his
   own Person. Lo, on a sudden, the eternal birth ! Now there are two
   Persons and in the very act of the Son's proceeding from the Father,
   the knower looking back, leaps to the perfect understanding of his
   Father whence he sprang. In that same origin these two natures know
   each other with one knowledge. The knowing is the same as the knower
   himself. Therein they know themselves one love in the omnipotence of
   the Father whence the knower sprang. This love is their common
   spiration : in this love they are one. It is the third Person. It
   starts with the re- birth, the reposing of the knower on the heart of
   the omnipotent Father. Thus the first river originates the second
   river, in con- junction with the original source. Hence the several
   natures are all one in nature and this nature is the same in the
   several natures. That is to say, Persons. ^

   125. But what enjoyment do the Persons get out of their natural essence
   ? ' -- Well, as you may prove, the Persons are in their nature and
   their nature in the Persons : their nature keeps the Persons quite
   distinct while at the same time preserving them in unity. As preserving
   them in one, nature is simply the power of the Persons. In this same
   power the three Persons disappear into their nature. For essence and
   nature form one light in light's summit, the impartible image of God,
   essence passing into nature ; moreover all the Persons being clapt into
   their nature vanish into the dim silence of their interior being. There
   they retain no per- sonality for with this confinement goes entire loss
   of property. Lo, God de-spirited ! The fathomless deep is fathomed by
   the master- mind of God. The delight and satisfaction and perfection
   found therein no nature can describe. That is how the three Persons
   enjoy their natural essence.

   proper habitation is its source. The naked spark of spirit is the mens.
   Mens is the natural image of the spirit. But mind is never perfect
   spirit till it passes into its exemplar and is lost to its own
   selfhood, escaping in that same natural image into its ideal nature. In
   this sense its abode is in the naught of its idea rather than in its
   source. But its origin is its real abode.

   127. How is the Son re-born in the Father once he has come forth ? --
   In this way. The Father grasps the light of his own understanding and
   bears it into the ground of his essence. Thus the knower is reflected
   back into the light of his Father's heart.

   128. I should much like to know, about the appearance of the paternal
   Person in the unity, where it is all-conceiving.' -- When the Father
   conceiving the impartible idea of all things in the unity, appears to
   himself in Person and essence, lo, the paternal Person vanishes in this
   mysterious unity and there is an end of the Father and of all
   distinctions. Unity conceiving all as one, nothing but one appears and
   communes with itself. But sinee logieally speak- ing there is Person in
   the unity, it is in this unity that it conceives its nature, appearing
   and calling itself Person and there too the paternal Person must
   conceive his unity, as the unity the Person, since both of them have
   the same nature.

   129. Mark how conception differs. There is ideal conception and real
   concej^tion. Ideal conception is the nature's general conception of the
   Persons, all the three. But the real conception is the special
   conception of each particular Person in its own proper nature in the
   nature.

   130. Tell me, when God conceives the soul does he conceive her by ideal
   conception or by real conception ? ' -- He conceives her by ideal
   conception for this general idea embraces all in one ; supposing he
   conceived her by particular conception she would be bereft of the
   flower of her nature for in a particular conception nothing is
   conceived besides the special nature of the thing itself. In other
   words, its nature as a unit, an expression, not its innate nobility.

   131. Mark the noble lineage of the Persons. They are uncreated and
   without beginning and infinite and inconceivable and are possessed of
   property which comes to them in the course of nature. Not so with the
   soul : she is created and has a beginning and is man and has
   possessions and not property for to her it is all given.

   182. Is the seer as free as the will ? ' -- No, not by any means. If it
   were it would be always in the naked Godhead. But it is not ; it has to
   be doing its work, the ordering and management of the various powers.
   Will has not got this to do : it bids and forbids.

   188. Now what I want to know is this : why has the Godhead a feminine
   name and no feminine function and the Person of the Father on the other
   hand a masculine name and a feminine function ? ' -- The explanation is
   this. The Godhead contains all things impartibly and the thing in which
   another is contained is called mother in virtue of this content. It
   has, however, no maternal act since it docs not as such give birth to
   anything. The Father, again, has a masculine name and a feminine
   function and the reason is that the Father in Person docs not contain
   things in him, he begets them out of him by the power of his Person.
   The Father in his proper personality is empty of the content which he
   impartibly contains. But also he plays a mother's part, the unity
   providing him with all that ho brings forth. In this bringing forth he
   is functioning as mother ; as being free from content in his personal
   nature he retains his masculine name. The birth of the Son shows the
   Father travailing. But the Father is Father in that he begets.

   134. Then there is this question : Is the Son born or is he not born or
   is he still to be born ? ' -- Let us consider. There are three Persons
   and that shows the Son is born for each of the Persons has its own
   peculiar nature. They could none of them have this if the Son had not
   been born. This proves the Son is born. But the Father changes not at
   all in his eternal childbirth : could we attribute to him any deed at
   all it would be in the sense that anything he docs he is doing now and
   what he is doing now he has always done, for with him there is no past
   nor future. This proves the Son has not been born : he is now this
   instant being born and this now is an ever-becoming ; as the Father
   himself says, To-day have I begotten thee.' To-day is the etern&l now.
   It is in this now that his birth is taking place.

   135. Remember, the eternal Word is both unborn and born. This is a hard
   saying, but being in the Trinity the Word must needs be born ; it
   cannot there be called the unborn Word. Taking the eternal Word as
   Person, it is born ; but take it in its essence and the Word is
   non-existent. Here the Word has to be born.

   136. Now mark how we argue that the Word remains the Word unborn. Where
   the Word issues from the Father as a birth it shows its born nature and
   proclaims the Father parent. But where the Word proceeds from the
   Father as a light it is the species of the Father and shows the Father
   formless for it has the form of the Father. He himself declared, He who
   seeth me seeth my Father.' Thus the Word reveals the Father in his own
   form and shows the Father formless and where the Word proceeds from the
   Father as understanding it proceeds as abiding within.

   As intelligence leaves not the heart but reveals to himself the man in
   whom it dwells, so we have the Word in the eternal procession of the
   Father, the Word which proceeds from understanding, while understanding
   itself does not issue forth but abides within. In this procession wc
   have, in the immanent understanding, the Word unborn. This explains
   what is meant by the unborn Word and how, in the eternal procession,
   the Word is as it were born of understanding and is still to be born
   and is this instant being born.

   137. One of the masters (Erigena) says : The Father never wrought
   anything inferior to himself. If this is true, then all the creatures
   God has ever wrought are God. The question here is, whether the work
   wrought is as noble as the worker when the worker is God ? Let us see.
   We speak of a working work and a wrought work. The working work is God,
   the wrought work is not God for it is creature. Hence the explanation.
   When it is stated that the Father wrought no work inferior to himself
   that is as good as saying that the Father does one work and one alone
   in his own Person, to wit, the begetting of his Son in the eternal
   emanation personal and essential. Only this one work properly belongs
   to the Father-nature and all other work wrought we attribute not to the
   Father alone but to the three Persons atid one God. But, it may be
   objected, can the eternal emanation of the Son from the Father be
   called a work ? You can look at it in this way. Everything existing has
   its appropriate work ; the work of fire, for instance, is to heat and
   so with understanding : it is its work to understand itself. Here the
   work is not inferior to the worker. And in this sense the Son may very
   well be called the eternaf work of the Father. He brings him forth
   eternally as Person who yet remains in him in essence.

   138. Then there is the question : Was the eternal Word con- ceived in
   Mary in Person and essence and was it in the bosom of the Father as
   Person and essence as well ? -- In the continuous emanation wherein the
   Word emanates from the Father as it were from understanding, wherein
   the Word is now being born, in that same emanation Mary received the
   eternal Word in a point of time as Person and essence, in its immanence
   : the Word as flowing from the understanding of the Father. It remained
   in the bosom of the Father as immanent understanding personal and
   essential. Thus it came, coming after the manner of a flow and
   remaining within after the manner of an understanding. Ah, what light
   and grace enlightened souls obtain from this glorious knowledge !

   139. To return to Christ. According to theologists, our Lord Jesus
   Christ's soul and Lucifer's were made in the same light.

   The soul of Jesus Christ our Lord was the very wisest soul that ever
   was. She turned in the creature to the creator wherefore the Father
   clothed her in the divine garment and flower of her nature. Lucifer
   turned to the deficiency and he therefore fell, falling eternally. So
   fall all they who turn away from God to perishable things.

   140. But this light which Christ's soul supernaturally was, this was a
   creature and our Lord's soul itself being creature too, which of these
   two creatures then, theologians ask, is the nobler and the higher ? --
   I was asking one wise doctor about this and he said that in one way the
   light is nobler but in another Christ. Sec what this supernatural light
   means. When Christ's soul was created she was taken from herself and
   haled above herself into the Tri-unity. Therewith she was united. This
   was not natural to her, it was all above nature, what befell Christ's
   soul. What befell was the supernatural light. Herein Christ's soul was
   omnipotent, in virtue of this happening. Here the supernatural light is
   nobler than Christ's soul, you can see that for yourselves. The adorner
   is more noble than the thing that it adorns. Take an illustration.
   Material is adorned by colour while the colour is displayed by the
   material, since it has no body of its own. Even so Christ's soul is
   adorned by this supernatural light and on the other hand Christ's soul
   makes manifest this supernatural light.

   141. Now mark how the soul of Christ is nobler than the super-

   natural light. The supernatural light having had its effect upon
   Christ's soul (it happens in a flash), Christ has no more to do with
   this supernatural light, for the union of divine and human nature to
   one Person liappens instantly and once for all. Here the soul of Christ
   is nobler than the supernatural light. *

   a 42. Then as to souls who have overcome themselves so far as to
   imagine themselves God. This is due to nothing more than their own
   natural light : they are withdrawn into themselves till they can see
   themselves in it as light. You know how a blow in the eye will
   sometimes make one see stars. By stars in their eyes these souls see
   themselves. The way the supernatural light reveals the soul to herself
   is this : the naked spark of the soul, her mens, reflects the
   supernatural light and the pure essence of her spirit seeing itself in
   this supernatural light fondly imagines itself God. But as you see, it
   is nothing else than the spirit in the supernatural light, a very great
   perfection, none the less.

   143. Another question is, whether God is (God) by nature or by will ?
   -- He is God not by nature nor by will. If God were God by nature he
   would be a caused God : nature would have caused him. But that is not
   the case. And the same with will : were he God by will he would be
   subject to will and will would

   be superior to God. Which is not true either ; but he is God naturally,
   not by nature ; he is God willingly and not by will. That is the
   answer.

   144. Again, did God beget himself or did he beget some other ? -- He
   did not beget himself nor any other : God the Father is unbcgotten God.
   He begat another and not any other. He begat another, i.e, another
   Person, not something other, i,e. another nature : the impartible
   nature of the Father is also the impartible nature of the Son and of
   their common Spirit. That is the answer.

   145. It is a question among theologians whether the nature is common to
   the Persons and the Persons common to the nature seeing that each
   Person contains the whole of nature as its natural being. Docs God
   impart himself to human nature ? -- ^Yes. -- How can God impart himself
   to human nature if he is one in essence and distinct in Person ? --
   Each of the Persons has the nature as a whole and the Person of the
   Son, by assuming human nature, imparted himself to it, the two natures
   meeting in his Person. Here divine and human natures are in communion.
   Only the middle Person took on human nature but the three Persons are
   equally allied with the three powers of the soul. -- Are these two
   natures one or are they united ? -- They are united and not one. That
   is one which is in itself without any other and where two meet in one
   they arc united. -- How arc these two natures united ? -- They are
   united by something between so that each one keeps its own nature. The
   Person which took on human nature is the medium uniting these two
   natures. Had this Person not assumed man's nature the two natures could
   not have been united. Neither robs thft other of its idiosyncrasy ;
   uncreated nature does not rob created nature of its createdness nor
   docs created nature rob the uncreated of its uncrcatcdness. -- How did
   the Person take man's nature ? -- He assumed manhood and not man. --
   What is the difference between man and manhood ? -- Man originates with
   perfect man and is not taken by a Person : it is two natures united in
   one Person. But manhood is emanating God and man and is taken by the
   Person of the Son and is divine and human nature and corporal nature
   united in one person. So much for man and manhood.

   146. Did the Person take the manhood of our Lady ? -- Yes and no. He
   took the bodily nature of our Lady and the nature of his spirit God
   produced from naught and poured it into corporal nature ; God inspired
   his spirit and embodied himself in his body. -- Is our Lady, soul and
   body, one person ? -- Yes. -- Did he not take the person of our Lady ?
   -- No. The eternal Word of the Father took to itself what was not there
   already. There was

   Image of page 0499 #seq_0499 w {

   LIBER POSITIONUM 475

   Person there for the eternal Word is itself a Person. But human nature
   was not there. Hence the eternal Word assumed a nature not a person ;
   God's nature and man's nature were united in one common form with one
   Person for Christ does not belie himself. -- ^What brings about this
   union ? -- Grace. -- What is grace ? -- According to Dionysius, grace
   is the light of the soul, which lights the understanding of the soul.
   This light is not God but it is something from God. Just as the
   sunshine is not the sun but something that comes from the sun so God
   sheds this light into the soul. In this light man knows and loves and
   to some extent enjoys in time what beatilic spirits know and love and
   feel in eternal life. But here in time man knows and loves in his own
   way, dimly : he docs not see God face to face as a spirit does in
   eternal life. Yet the mere feeling of him makes a man able to do all
   things, to practise all the virtues and in the virtues he grows Godlike
   and the liker God in virtues the more one he is with God. Thus grace
   makes for union.

   147. There is a further cpiestion about the union of divine and human
   nature : have they both the same essence in the Person they arc joined
   in or have they two essences in this non-potential state ? -- One
   Person can have no more than one essence. So far as the personal nature
   is Person each nature is its own hypostasis. Where two natures are
   created in one Person that Person has one essence and that in two
   natures so far as the two natures are unmingled. -- Then we may
   consider nature as apart from essence in the personal union ? -- Yes,
   it can be seen from another point of view. We find nature in its image
   unmingled but in the Person two natures are present in one Person as in
   their hypostasis. So far as both belong to the same Person the Person
   has ohe essence and that in two natures. The Persons arc eternal, they
   are in no- wise creature for they have no before or after. Person, that
   is unity keeping silence albeit big with speech. The Persons are not
   contained by the unity : they arc in unity.

   148. There is the question of the worker and the work, whether the work
   is as noble, as perfect as the worker ? This refers to the Persons of
   the Trinity. Examine it in this way. The Father is an origin able to
   originate an origin like unto himself. The Son is such an origin and he
   together with his Father originates their common Spirit. Here the
   worker and the work, the effectual work of revelation, are equally
   perfect. As Dionysius says, The first cause causes everything equal to
   itself.' It was said by one master that the work wrought by God in the
   patient soul which is all bare of things is nobler than any of the
   works he has ever wrought in time in heaven or in earth. Just think
   what this means. The works God has wrought in the angels in heaven

   MEISTER ECKHART

   were wrought by the almighty power of God who created them from naught.
   He was not hindered in this work. In the case of the soul which also he
   created out of naught, he endowed her with free will nor would God do a
   single thing without her free will's sanction. But when the soul is
   passive and cleared of every- thing in her that might be a hindrance to
   God's will and turning to God of her own account she gives God the
   freedom of her noble will as though she had never had free will,
   enabling God to work in her as freely as when he made all things from
   naught, then this work has two outstanding features. One is that her
   free will is no obstacle to God although he is so careful not to
   override free will : God can work as freely as he will, what he will
   and when he will and how he will just as if the soul had no free will.
   The second feature is that God being free in himself his work is freely
   wrought in what by right of its free will might well object but which
   does in fact raise no objection. And that is why this is the noblest
   work God does in heaven or earth in respect of creature. Now you may
   ask what this work is ? It is nothing less than God's revelation of
   himself to himself in the soul. As sure as he is in himself he himself
   is in this work. That which is wrought in is turned into that which
   works there, to the likeness of him, the worker, who has wrought there
   his like. Here the work which is wrought is as perfect as the worker
   for it is his living image which is in the work.

   149. The soul cannot prepare herself for the reception of God : he who
   prepares her, him does she receive in preparation. There is a special
   profit accruing to the soul in the reception of the body of our Lord,
   which she does not get in any other gift. -- What profit is that ? ' --
   Her nature receives its own nature for Jesus Christ's nature is our
   nature. Nature is received by nature albeit not received pure nature :
   it is received united with divine nature.

   150. Mark how these two natures are united. They are not united nature
   to nature : they arc joined together in one Person, i.e. the middle
   Person. Just as the divine nature is the nature of this Person so is
   human nature in Christ the Person in the Trinity. For what the eternal
   Word assumed was humanity not a human person. Had the eternal Word
   assumed a human person there would be four Persons in the Trinity. But
   there are not. Jesus Christ's humanity in the eternal Word is the very
   Person who has ever been the central figure of the Trinity. There- in
   is not one nature as there is one Person : the natures are of different
   nature and arc united in the Person. Wherefore whoso receives the body
   of our Lord receives the middle Person and divine nature and Christ's
   manhood, which is Person in the

   eternal Word, and Christ's eternal soul. We receive this all at once in
   Jesus Christ's body. This we do not do in any other gift in heaven or
   earth. Let us therefore prize this gift above all other gifts to be
   gotten here below.

   151. When Christ gave his body to his disciples he said, Take, eat,
   this is my body.' But Christ was mortal. Now the question is, did
   Christ give his body mortal or immortal ? According to Hugo of St
   Victor, every property of his original body of immor- tality, the whole
   of these Christ had in him what time he was mortal. So in spite of
   being mortal he could give his brethren his immortal body ; if he had
   given them his mortal body the eating of it would have outraged them.
   Bishop Albertus contro- verts this doctor. I am amazed, he says, that
   such a great authority should hazard such a foolish statement. Every
   nature emanates from its appropriate form and Christ's form here was
   mortal and no immortal property could emanate from his mortal form. If
   you really want to know how Christ gave his body, mortal and immortal,
   he gave his body as mortal in itself and immortal in its form and in
   its effect for its action is divine and he gave it therefore in another
   form than that of himself. He gave his body as immortal in its work and
   in its form and mortal in itself for in his mortal body Christ had
   power to communicate his body immortally as to its effect but not so as
   to its own nature.

   152. It is a question whether in Christ's body there remains aught of
   what it seems ? No, there is seeming without substance and substance
   without seeming. It seems to be bread but there is really no substance
   of bread : it is really the body of God without its appearance. So far
   as its appearance goes it would nourish us like any other food. But if
   there is really no 'substance of bread and only the substance of bread
   feeds the body then how, without the substance of bread, does this
   nourish the body ? -- At the consecration of the body of our Lord the
   bread loses its nature while it retains its form, its mass, its smell
   and its feeling of bread, so that it does not disappear. Nothing we can
   taste and feel, nothing, in short, which is apparent to the outward
   senses, is God's body. The outward senses do not lose what pertains to
   them. They derive their nourishment from such things as re- main. In
   bread the solid part is all that nourishes. The solidity of the body of
   Christ is not his body : the solid of the bread remains and that feeds
   the outward man. This is the explanation of how the sacrament nourishes
   like any other food. But it really has none of the nature of bread.

   158. -- ^When Christ consecrated his body on that Sabbath day and gave
   it to his disciples, supposing some to have been left and hidden in a
   bush, would this have died when Christ died on the

   MEISTER ECKHART

   cross ? -- If the consecrated body had been maltreated by scourging or
   in any other way, that would not have hurt it. Christ suffered no hurt
   by eating in the sacrament for he gave his body in another form than
   that of himself. Christ suffered not at all in the form he gave. But
   mark. When Christ died upon the cross since there lay under
   consecration the body of the soul that died upon the cross therefore
   all the pain Christ suffered in his human form was suffered by his body
   under consecration. When Christ died to his manhood there died his body
   dying under consecration, for there was no more than a single body.
   This death of Christ was the parting of the soul from body ; and since
   she is impartible therefore wherever she is she is altogether. When she
   was in the precincts of hell she was not in the body. Neither could she
   be ^ in his consecrated body. We speak here of two bodies, but there is
   only one, that which rose from the dead on the third day.

   154. Did the consecrated body rise too ? -- Oh yes, it rose up
   glorified for it was the Christ.

   155. Then it was questioned, can the soul while in this body get to the
   point of receiving without means ? -- The answer is both no and yes. In
   the first sense I declare that anything the soul receives must be by
   light and grace. Light and grace are her means for she is creature.
   Soul cannot do without these means as long as she is in the body. On
   the other hand the affirmative reply, that the soul is able to receive
   direct while in the body, is argued thus. The soul has within her a
   likeness of the sovran good. In this likeness she receives like. Here
   like is being received direct by like. Mark how. In receiving thus
   without means we have to abide by this likeness. -- Wherein does this
   like- ness consist ? -- Likeness to the sovran good consists in
   motionless- ness of the inner and the outer man : in imperturbability
   towards all nether things, the outward man not being moved by them nor
   the inward man disturbed by any mental agitation ; he remains firm and
   unshaken in the here and now. Be so always.

   156. One other question. How have all things been in God ? -- In his
   impartible essence all things subsist impartibly, no one more noble
   than another. But in the essential Word where all things are distinct
   one thing is nobler than another.

   157. Once the spirit is one with God is it at all enriched by virtues ?
   -- Virtues are products of necessity and necessity enriches not the
   spirit. It is not virtues that enrich the spirit but the fniit of
   virtues.

   158. It may be asked, are we to take the impartible image of all things
   as Person or essence ? -- There are three distinct Persons but not
   three images to correspond. We may therefore look at the image in the
   light of impartible essence. But since essence

   Image of page 0503 #seq_0503 w {

   LIBER POSmONUM 479

   in the Persons is possessed impartibly as essence and partibly as
   speech (one utterance in the Father and another in the Son and another
   in the Holy Ghost), therefore we may take the image of the Trinity also
   as a speaking in the Persons as well as simple essence, for the essence
   is simple in the Persons no less than in its own particular nature.

   159. It may be asked, has the one essence no form to correspond with
   its essential nature ? -- That which reveals another is its form.
   Essence cannot manifest itself in its essential nature : it is mani-
   fested by the Persons. Hence the Persons are the form of the

   ssence so far as they reveal it. But Person is one thing, essence is
   another. Nothing that exists can be without its proper form.

   f essence exists it must wear its appropriate form. In its own
   essential form it is manifest to itself as well as to the Persons and
   none else. But the Persons reveal it to creatures. Here the Persons are
   its form by the fact of being Persons and making manifest the formless
   essence. The Persons are the form of the essence inasmuch as they
   reveal it and in its arcane nature it has its own form latent in
   itself. This form is none other than the immanent essence itself. Under
   this essential form the forms of all things arc formless for this
   essential form is the impartible form of all things : this universal
   form is essential God in its onefold nature and tlireefold as uttered
   in the Persons.

   160. This is what the spirit clearly sees in a foretaste of delight.
   The best the spirit can hope for in this body is the perennial feeling
   of being without all and within all. Without all means in com- plete
   detachment, remote from self and things. In all means abiding in
   perpetual stillness : conscious life in its eternal exemplar wherein
   the universal image shines in impartibility. There the spirit dwells in
   all : it has attained to its ideal.

   161. Doctors discuss that most abstruse and difficult of ques- tions :
   What is that which is not caused and whicth, though neither essence nor
   yet Person, has might and power in the Father and makes the Father
   father and the essence essence ? -- The answer needs your close
   attention. Nature cannot be without something whose nature it is and
   the Person of the Fatlier cannot be without someone whose Person it is.
   Neither can exist without the other so neither can originate the other.
   At the same time they have a dual character ; speech-silence. Where
   both alike vanish into their common ground they have the same character
   ; there speech detracts not from silence neither silence from speech.
   This lapse into their common ground applies to the eternal and eventful
   nature. Uneventful nature does not interfere : eventful nature goes on
   speaking while uneventful nature holds its peace. But this uneventful
   nature must have an hypostasis, the eternal

   and eventful nature which gives power and might to the objective
   Person. This makes the Father father and the nature nature ; not that
   the Father has an eventful nature : his is the eternal uneventfulness.
   This let none gainsay in the interests of eternal truth for it is the
   eternal truth. The ignorant, remember, are given to attacking the
   eternal verity.

   162 . St Dionysius says the highest spirits are poured into the lower
   in succession, and the lowest are poured into the soul. Now the
   question is, can the soul receive at all without the aid or knowledge
   of superior angels ? I answer. Grant one spirit is more toward than the
   rest then anything received by the other spirits will be known
   beforehand to this spirit which is better placed than any of the
   others. Thus a Seraph is more open to divine inspiration than any
   single spirit in this life and for two reasons. One is that the angel
   being pure spirit cannot be poured into the soul. While sharing with
   the body she has no accom- modation for the angel. Secondly, the angel
   is in the condition of ever beholding the divine light and that is not
   for any soul in this life. Hence Seraph is more apt to receive God's
   inspiration and what all spirits receive that spirit knows who is more
   apt than all the rest. Seraph is not the means of its reception, but,
   flying as he does nearer to the source of the divine light, it is
   apparent to him what other spirits are getting of that light. In this
   sense souls get nothing without the angels knowing.

   But let us sec, in the working of the soul, if we cannot find some
   secret way in which enlightened souls receive without the Seraph's
   knowledge. Well, as you know, the soul animates the members of the body
   all unbeknownst to those same members. And though life runs so secretly
   into all the limbs that they are unaware of its mysterious flow, the
   work of life is none the less carried on in them. The fact is, God
   instils his life into the soul and into every spirit surreptitiously :
   no Seraph knows about this stealthy stream of life. Its reception by
   the soul is a clandestine act. How should Seraph know ? He knows
   nothing of himself or of the soul. That is one thing the soul receives
   without the higher angels knowing.

   The other she receives in the mysterious spark of her own nature, her
   undivided likeness. But w^hen like meets like there is no mean between
   them. Like gives like its likeness all unknown to its unlike, in
   unbroken union. But Seraph is unlike the soul. A Seraph, as you know,
   is spirit not embodied in any sort of body. But soul is spirit embodied
   in something of the kind. And secondly to Seraph in his created nature
   there came all at once and without addition what he this day possesses
   in his vision of the eternal light ; for he is constant in his likeness
   to God. Here the soul is different from the angels for in the
   reflection of her like

   she receives a secret influx unknown to any angel. It has been said by
   John, a sage of Greece, that the likeness of the soul consists in
   perfect likeness to that which has no like. Dionysius calls the angels
   divine minds.' And St Bernard says of those who lead angelic lives
   while in the flesh that into them there flows the mind of God as it
   does into the angels. O thou God turned God in thy temporal unified
   mind, thou sjfirit inspired into the oneness of God, stand up and do
   thy crowning work !

   You ask how the spirit stands up ? He stands on his two feet,
   understanding and love, and oversteps all perishable things lest he
   should foul his feet with matter of corruption. -- And what is his
   crowning work ? -- The clear and naked vision of the highest good, God
   yonder, wherein the highest good shall bathe the spirit in the light of
   exquisite consciousness. Then shall thou look and see ! -- Do the
   light-streams of the highest good affect the spirit ? -- -- When the
   Sovran Good floods the spirit with light the spirit is borne up above
   its natural abode.

   Meister Eckhart was besought by his good friends, Give us one last word
   before you go.' He said, I will give you a rule which is the sum of all
   my arguments, the key to the whole theory and' praetiee of the tnith.
   ''

   It very often happens that a thing seems small us which is of greater
   moment in God's sight than what looms large in ours. Wherefore it
   behoves us to take alike from God everytiiing he sends us without ever
   thinking or looking to see which is greatest or highest or best but
   following blindly God's lead, that is to say, our own feeling, our
   strongest dictates, what we arc most prompted to do. Then God gives us
   the most in the least without fail.

   People often shirk the least and prevent themsel s getting the most in
   the least. They are wrong. God is every wise, the same in every guise
   to him who can see him the same. There is much searching of heart as to
   whether one's promptings come from God or no ; but this we can soon
   tell for if we find ourselves aware of, privy to, God's will above all
   when we follow our own impulse, our clearest intimations, then we may
   take it that they come from God.

   Somejpeople make believe to find God as a light or savour ; they may
   find a light or a savour but that is not to find God. Aecording to one
   scripture, God shines in the dark where every now and then we may catch
   a glimpse of him. Where to us God shows least he is often most. So it
   behoves us to take God the same in every mode and in every thing.

   Someone may say, But if I do take God alike in every mode and every
   thing my mind refuses to abide in that mode or in this one as in that.
   -- Then I say, he is wrong. For finding God in one way rather than
   another, I allow, due credit, but that is not the best. God is
   everywise, alike in every guise to one who can find him the same.
   Knowing one guise, such and such, is not knowing God. Finding this or
   that is not finding God. God is everywise, the same in every guise to
   one who can see him the same.

   Someone may "object, But to find God in every mode and in every thing
   do I not need some special way ? -- In whatever way you find God best
   and are most aware of him that way pursue. Should another way appear
   quite different from the first you will

   do right in quitting that to close ivith God in this one which appears
   as in the one forsworn. It is a counsel of perfection in this manner to
   attain to such a final certainty and peace that we can see God and are
   able to enjoy him in any guise and in any thing without having to stop
   and look for him at all : a boon accorded me. For this and to this end
   all works are wrought and on the whole works help. The things that do
   not help let us eschew.

   We thank thee, heavenly Father, for giving us thy only Son in whom thou
   givest thine own self and all things. We pray thee, heavenly Father, as
   thou has given us thy only Son our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and
   in whom thou dost deny us naught, nor "ouldst nor cculdst not, hear us
   in him and make us pure and free from all our many faults, uniting us
   with him in thee. Amen.
